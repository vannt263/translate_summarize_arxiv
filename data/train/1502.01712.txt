    "in previous galactic dynamo simulations , the mean - field equations have been solved for the magnetic field , but the equations for the mass flow have been neglected .",
    "this is not important for the solutions in the galactic disc , because there the mass flows are very slow .",
    "however , it is important in the halo in which the magnetic flux is diffused upward across the halo to entirely escape from the galaxy .",
    "this escape is necessary for our galaxy because the total flux must be conserved and the flux in any dynamo origin theory must start from a very small value and grow to its present value . in our galaxy",
    "the present flux is observed to be non zero .",
    "however , during the amplification the mass which is tied to the flux by flux - freezing must also diffuse out of the galaxy with the magnetic flux .",
    "this mass is acted on by the gravitational field of the galaxy .",
    "this gravitational field can pull the mass and flux tied to it back into the galactic disc as fast as the halo turbulence is diffusing the flux upward .",
    "indeed , a simple estimate shows that for the generally accepted value of the diffusion coefficient ( of order of @xmath0 ) the gravitational force dominates over the diffusion and the dynamo is strongly inhibited .",
    "this estimate comes from an elementary one - dimensional problem that includes diffusion , flux - freezing , and gravity .    to get around this difficulty a new idea",
    "is presented in this paper for a process that dissipates the flux by the amount required by any dynamo origin theory .",
    "this process does not require the removal of mass from the galaxy , as is required by previous origin theories when flux - freezing is included .",
    "it involves those galactic superbubbles that break out of the disc .",
    "it is known that when a superbubble shell does break out of the galaxy its shells break up into many fragments , and from each of these fragments , a new instability , the _ spike _ instability can develop .",
    "this instability accelerates a small mass , and the small piece of the flux swept up by it , to faster than the galactic escape velocity allowing these pieces to ballistically escape from the galaxy . as a consequence , the part of the flux line attached to it remaining in the disc is effectively cut into short pieces of finite length .",
    "these pieces , although connected to each other through the expelled pieces , are not inhibited from rotating freely and in this way way _ flux _ of these lines is dissipated .",
    "although very little mass is actually removed from the galaxy and the rest of the mass on the the line remains in the disc , its flux not longer counts in the balance of flux in the dynamo theory .",
    "it turns out that this _ in sit tu _ dissipation is equivalent to that resulting from flux expulsion , but it not subject to the gravitational difficulty arising from the flux - freezing constraint .",
    "this paper is devoted to elaborating how this second process can enable the alpha - omega dynamo to function without the difficulties involved in flux and mass escape .    in the next section",
    ", an attempt is made to quantify the difficulties encountered when flux - freezing and the effect of gravity on the related mass are included in the dynamo simulations .",
    "these are semi quantified by a simple one - dimensional model , and shown to be potentially serious .    in the third section ,",
    "i present the proposed new solution , and introduce the spike instability and the relevant properties of the superbubbles . in sections four and five , i describe the superbubble phenomena and its properties which underlie the process . in section six ,",
    "i derive the linear and non linear properties of the spike instability . in section seven ,",
    "i give an estimate for the number of spikes , the rate at which any relevant line is cut per unit time , and the mean length of the cuts . in section eight",
    "i calculate the rate of rotation of the relevant cut lines of force , which depend on their length , and the time for their flux to be dissipated by this rotation .",
    "this time is the important time which sets a limit on the speed of the dynamo if no line escape is possible .",
    "the number of lines whose lengths suffer the spike instability is also estimated .    the tentative conclusion from this : in approximately a billion years enough cuts are produced that every line in the outer quarters of the disc , loses its mean flux .",
    "this implies that the dynamo can grow the galactic field without the need for actual flux escape .",
    "however , the rate of dynamo growth is somewhat slower than thought at first .",
    "our galaxy has a strong large - scale magnetic field and its origin is of considerable astrophysical interest .",
    "where does it come from ?",
    "it is generally agreed that the galaxy started off with a very weak seed field , perhaps as weak as @xmath1 gauss produced by cosmological processes , ( kulsrud et .",
    "al . 1997 ; moss and sokoloff 2013 ) .",
    "this field is believed to be increased exponentially by a galactic dynamo .",
    "the problem is complicated for our galaxy , which is known to have a non zero flux frin measurements which indicate that the field does not change sign across the galactic midplane .",
    "this implies that some flux must leave the galaxy .",
    "a large number of important papers have been written on this galactic dynamo .",
    "examples of these include the following references : baryshnikova et .",

    "1977 , ruzmaikin et .",
    "al . 1996 ; and parker 1997 . in these papers",
    "the structure of the galaxy is taken as a thin disc with thickness @xmath2 .",
    "this disc is embedded in a large sphere of radius @xmath3 .",
    "the region of the galaxy outside of the disc is called the halo .    in these papers the mean - field dynamo equations ( steenbeck et .",
    "al . 1966 )",
    "are successfully solved throughout the sphere with solutions that grow exponentially in a growth time of a few hundred million years .",
    "these equations are @xmath4    in these equations alpha , which produces the famous alpha effect , turns toroidal flux into poloidal flux .",
    "@xmath5 is the differential rotation of the galaxy , and it turns poloidal flux into toroidal flux .",
    "@xmath6 is the coefficient of turbulent magnetic diffusion which mixes up the magnetic fields .",
    "to allow growth of the galactic field , which starts with zero flux early on and at present has non zero flux , conditions must be satisfied on the surface of the halo that allow the escape of flux into the intergalactic medium .",
    "these integrations are mathematically correct , but they ignore two important physical effects , which throws some doubt on the physical soundness of their results .",
    "these two effects are :    \\1 .",
    "flux - freezing in detail .",
    "the mean field equations given in equation  ( [ eq : a ] ) do preserve flux - freezing on the large scale , but they do not take into account that even on small scales any mass tied to a given flux tube must remain tied to this flux tube as it moves . by ignoring this property the solutions have been able to avoid the dynamics of the mass flow and are solved without regard to the mass dynamics , which would follow from flux - freezing .",
    "\\2 . the gravitational field .",
    "once mass flow is ignored there is no need to take into account the gravitational field of the galaxy .",
    "however , it has a strong effect on any mass flow tied to the flux flow . in any simulation in which the mass is tied to the flux",
    ", the gravitational field plays an important role .    in order to understand the importance of these effects most clearly ,",
    "i consider only the earliest phases of the galactic dynamo .",
    "this is the phase in which when the lorentz forces are too weak to be macroscopically important , but strong enough to enforce flux - freezing .",
    "i show by a simplified model , that when these two effects are included in the simulation , the gravitational field will strongly affect the flow of the flux out of the halo . to this purpose",
    ", i ignore all dynamo terms except the beta terms , and i assume that @xmath6 is constant .",
    "the flow of the flux is treated most simply by considering what happens to a bundle of flux which leaves the disc at time @xmath7 .",
    "i assume one space dimension , @xmath8 , in the vertical direction normal to the disc .",
    "let @xmath9 be the intensity of the bundle and let us describe it by a collection of particles diffusing with diffusion coefficient @xmath6 , and under the influence of a downward gravitational field @xmath10 .",
    "it is physically reasonable to assume that the diffusion will occur in an downward accelerating frame with a diffusion coefficient whose value is independent of the acceleration .",
    "the frame is accelerating downward with at a constant value @xmath10 .",
    "then as shown in the appendix , @xmath11 the fraction of this bundle of particles that is beyond the radius of the galaxy , @xmath12 at time @xmath13 is , @xmath14\\ ] ] where erfc is the compliment of the error function .",
    "if @xmath15 the simplified model corresponds to the previous simulations and the fraction escaping is simply @xmath16\\ ] ]    as @xmath13 increases , the argument of the complimentary error functions decreases , and @xmath17 increases . finally , when when @xmath18 where @xmath19 the argument of @xmath20 is much less than unity , and the bulk of the flux is beyond @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath21 is the radius of the halo in units of 10 kpc and @xmath22 is @xmath6 in units of @xmath23 .",
    "these values are consistent with the dynamo times times attained in the dynamo models , which shows that the example gives roughly the correct results .    if we include the galactic gravitational field , @xmath24 , then the fraction of lost particles ( or flux ) is given by the full equation  ( [ eq : bb ] ) . in this case , as @xmath13 increases , the argument of erfc at first decreases till it reaches a minimum value at @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and then increases .",
    "that is , the lost flux in our model increases to @xmath27 , and then seems to decrease . in our model",
    "this corresponds to particles that have crossed @xmath12 and then fallen back inside @xmath28 .",
    "presumably , conditions beyond @xmath29 are different .",
    "for example , @xmath10 may weaker and other factors may enter not included in the model .",
    "therefore , assuming any flux that has passed beyond the halo boundary escapes , the largest fraction of the flux that can escape is @xmath30\\ ] ] @xmath31 is essentially the free fall time from the radius @xmath12 .",
    "numerically , we have the following table .    for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    for @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ".    for @xmath32 and @xmath36 .    for @xmath34 and @xmath37",
    ".    thus , we see that if @xmath6 is of order @xmath38 ( poezd 1993 , dickey and lockman 1990 , kulkarni and fich 1985 ) the fraction of the flux that escapes is extremely small . and that nearly all of the flux escaping from the _ disc _ is reflected back by the halo .",
    "that is to say the disc boundary conditions are essentially closed conditions , significantly modifying the standard dynamo solution .",
    "this simple approximate model implies that at the very least the standard simulations should be repeated with mass attached to the flux . by flux - freezing , and a gravitational field included .",
    "this should be the case even when one has a larger diffusion coefficient .    by the way , if the diffusion coefficient were large enough , ( i. e. @xmath39 to produce the escape of the flux in the presence of flux - freezing and gravity , a considerable amount of energy is involved . in fact , if a sufficient amount of flux escapes to allow the dynamo to double the magnetic flux in the disc , at least half of the disc will be lifted out of the galaxy .",
    "this will take approximately @xmath40 ergs for an annulus with width a kpc .",
    "if the removal occurs over a time of a billion years , the amount of power that must be supplied is of order @xmath41 ergs per second .",
    "this is and interesting number .",
    "the power need to resupply the loss of cosmic rays is a little larger .",
    "about @xmath13 times @xmath42 ergs per second and infalling mass has been invoked to supply this energy .",
    "clearly , the above argument rests heavily on the property of flux - freezing . to see that flux - freezing is valid in this case , consider the magnetic diffusion equation , in a static medium , with non turbulent resistivity , @xmath43 where according to spitzer ( 1962 ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the electron temperature in electron volts .",
    "let @xmath46 have a scale length of @xmath47 and estimate @xmath48",
    ". then with @xmath49 ( a typical astrophysical temperature ) , @xmath50 if @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "if the plasma is moving , then this change in @xmath46 represents the slippage of magnetic flux relative to the plasma . for the galactic dynamo",
    "these are appropriate values for @xmath13 and @xmath47 as the flux leaves the disc , and this very small slippage justifies the flux - freezing assumption . in any event , if @xmath6 is not sufficiently large , then either the standard galactic dynamo and needs to be revisited or flux - freezing must be invalid .    in light of this",
    ", it would seem prudent to look for a different way to get rid of the flux , and it is the purpose of this paper to suggest such an alternative .",
    "clearly , if the halo diffusion coefficient is not large enough something more is needed to make the galactic dynamo viable .",
    "parker ( see figure 3c in parker 1992 ) has suggested that it is not necessary for entire lines to be bodily moved out of the halo , but only partial loops of the lines .",
    "the mass on the loops themselves could be greatly reduced by mass sliding down the field lines , and the loops lifted upward by buoyancy or cosmic ray pressure .",
    "parker then suggests that these loops would be cut loose by magnetic reconnection and lifted out of the galaxy by buoyancy and cosmic ray forces .",
    "however , parker s lifting mechanism is not available in the early very weak field phase of the galactic disc .",
    "it is also true that in parker s model most of each flux line would be left behind and so the disc flux would appear to be unchanged .",
    "however , in section 9 , i show that , even without reconnection .",
    "such pieces of the field lines could be dissipated by horizontal turbulent diffusion .",
    "other plausible approaches to the flux removal problem are the use of supernovae or superbubbles to lift portions of the field lines out of the galaxy . in these approaches ,",
    "the main flux is also left behind in the disc , although these remnants of the field lines might also be dissipated as in section 9 . however",
    ", neither cosmic rays , supernovae or superbubbles have the capacity to directly lift even pieces of enough lines out of the galaxy .",
    "most type ii supernovae are too embedded in the disc to plow their way through the interstellar medium and leave the disc .",
    "only the very few type ii supernova that explode high above the disc could throw material out of the halo , and there are not enough of these .",
    "the largest superbubbles potentially have enough power , but once their shells leave the disc they become unstable and break up into fragments which fall back into the disc ( rafikov and kulsrud 2000 , mac low et .",
    "al . 1989 ) .",
    "this is true of our galaxy , but not necessarily true of others .",
    "in fact , in starburst galaxies the sources of activities are much stronger and strong plasma outflows from then are observed .",
    "but our galaxy is not forming stars at the rates of these galaxies , and there is no evidence that it ever did . on the other hand , smaller galaxies have weaker gravitational fields that could allow outflows .",
    "thus , the possible solutions to the flux problem in our early galaxy face _ two _ difficulties : ( 1 ) first , the existence of enough sources sufficiently powerful to expel mass from the halo .",
    "( 2 ) second , the removal of the net flux of any piece of a line left behind .    in this paper",
    "i suggest a different approach to the problem :    first , i propose that fragments of a superbubble shell which breaks out of the disc are unstable to forming spike - like structures that can drive small lumps of mass upward . the mass in these _ spikes _ acts like the mass in parker s loops , in that , mass can slide down their sides reducing the mass on their tops .",
    "the mass remaining on their tops can then be accelerated to the galactic escape velocity , and escape ballistically out of the galaxy .",
    "this mass will carry a small portion of the lines of force out of the halo .",
    "this will resolve the first difficulty .",
    "second , it is true that the line removal leaves the rest of the line in the disc , but this remainder is effectively _ cut _ into separate pieces .",
    "these pieces will be rotated by the turbulent motions in the disc .",
    "these pieces are still connected to each other through the pieces of flux expelled by the spikes .",
    "however , it easily seen that the flux in the disc is thus reduced , the residual part of the flux being carried away by the tiny pieces of expelled flux .",
    "thus , surprisingly , the flux will be reduced by the cuts due to the spikes , without the bulk of the flux lines or the mass being removed from the disc .",
    "if there were no spikes the lines of force could abstractly still be considered to be divided into pieces much as they are with the spikes .",
    "because the magnetic field is very weak the pieces could still rotate randomly .",
    "but in this case , these pieces are connected to each other through flux lines still in the disc so that no flux is lost .",
    "the two cases are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "on the left we have a line of force ad in the xy plane .",
    "imagine it divided into two parts ab and cd .",
    "let the two parts be rotated , as in the figure , to ab and cd. these two parts have no flux in the disc in either the @xmath53 direction or the @xmath54 direction .",
    "however they were connected by a short line bc which by flux - freezing goes to bc , so that the combined line abcd has the same flux in the disc as the original line .",
    "now , consider the same situation and the same line segments , except bc has been replaced by a line that stretches out of the disc to the spike and back .",
    "this segment has very little flux in the disc and the remaining lines have no flux .",
    "as far as the disc is concerned the line has been _ cut _ into two parts whose disc fluxes can cancel .",
    "it should be noted that if the line @xmath55 reconnected with itself , then the matter along it would naturally drop back into the disc and draw the line @xmath55 with it .",
    "thus , reconnection would destroy the model .",
    "but it seems highly unlikely that flux - freezing on this scale would allow reconnection .",
    "as the cut pieces rotate and decrease the disc flux , the magnetic line in the expelled parts will twist in the opposite direction consistent with flux and helicity is conservation .",
    "however , the helicity in the disc , under any plausible definition of local helicity , will change , as required for any dynamo that is growing the field .    in the rest of this paper",
    "i show that in a billion years , there are enough spikes produced by superbubbles to cut enough lines to reduce the flux by a finite value in the top and bottom parts of the disc .",
    "this will resolve the second difficulty .",
    "next , we discuss the superbubbles .",
    "superbubbles were first discovered by heiles in 1974 .",
    "( see heiles 1974 ) he found them by surveying the galactic disc in narrow , 10 @xmath56 , width doppler - shifted velocity bands of the 21 centimeter line .",
    "he found that in each band , the intensities were located in definite stripes . combining these stripes in velocity and space , he interpreted them as gigantic expanding bubbles .",
    "these bubbles were similar to those produced by stellar winds , ( weaver et al 1977 ) , but on a much greater scale .",
    "it was soon realized that superbubbles must be produced by multiple sequential supernovae originating in a forming galactic cluster of stars .",
    "the o and b stars in the cluster explode as supernovae almost as soon as they form , so that their energy instead of going into the kinetic energy of their remnants , goes into a bubble of high - pressure low - density plasma .",
    "this plasma pushes all the surrounding mass into a massive shell .",
    "an example of the larger of these superbubbles is the north polar spur .",
    "it has an enormous diameter of more than 80 degrees stretching across the whole sky .",
    "after a period of time , it was appreciated that nearly every superbubble could be identified with a young galactic cluster , and conversely every galactic cluster was generating a superbubble , ( elmegreen and clemens 1985 ) .    in these superbubbles",
    "the supernovae explode as frequently as once or twice every million years .",
    "the rate of explosions multiplied by the supernova energy per explosion gives the luminosity , @xmath57 , of the superbubble , which ranges from @xmath58 to @xmath41 ergs per second .",
    "a superbubble lasts as long as the o and b stars in its cluster are forming .",
    "generally , this lifetime is 25 to 50 million years .",
    "the average number of supernova in a cluster lies between 6 to several thousand .",
    "the luminosity of the superbubble @xmath57 is emitted continuously and can be estimated as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the supernova rate and @xmath61 is the energy of a supernova .",
    "it is found that the shells of superbubbles with @xmath62 , expand long enough to break out of the disc .",
    "prior to breakout , these superbubble decelerate , as more and more mass is snow - plowed into their shells . however , for the stronger ones after they breakout of the disc , there is no further surrounding mass to snow - plow , and the pressure of the bubble then accelerates the shell .",
    "this situation is unstable to the rayleigh - taylor instability because the low density plasma of the superbubble accelerates the high density shell . as a consequence , the part of the superbubble extending out of the disc , fragments into many pieces",
    "this is observed in the numerical simulations of mac low et .",
    "al.(1989 ) . after the breakup",
    ", the fragments continue to rise , but eventually their mass is brought to a stop by the galactic gravitational field , at heights of one or two kiloparsecs .",
    "this does not directly help the dynamo because when the superbubble mass falls back into the disc it drags the flux back , thus expelling no net flux .",
    "however , it is shown in section 7 that a spike instability develops on any fragments that manage to hold onto the superbubble pressure for a long enough time .",
    "this spike will manage to throw mass out of the halo even if the fragment falls back into the disc .",
    "in fact , the mass at the very top of the spike achieves velocities greater than the galactic escape velocity .",
    "the mass at the top of the spike will thus drag the flux lines that are still embedded in it , out of the galaxy .",
    "each of the very short segments of these lines will cut the rest of the line , that remains in the disc ,    the part of the shell above the midplane of the disc will contain all the flux in the top half of the disc and within a sphere of radius @xmath63 .",
    "the spikes are unstable only on the top of half of the fragments and contain flux and mass from one quarter of the disc .",
    "similar things happen to the part of the shell below the midplane .",
    "the rest of the paper , is devoted to finding the number of cuts in a given period of time .",
    "we first estimate the number of fragments into which the superbubble shell breaks .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 of these fragments will have a spike .",
    "then , after investigating the nature of the spikes , we calculate the number of lines of force it ejects from the galaxy , i.e. the number of cuts it makes .    next",
    ", we find the total number of spikes and cuts above the midplane due to a single superbubble then , making use of the rate of production of superbubbles per unit area and time , we calculate the number of cuts made per square kiloparsec per million years .    by considering an annulus through the solar circle , we determine both the number of lines and the number of cuts in this annulus in @xmath64 million years .",
    "the ratio of these two numbers is the number of cuts per line in this time .    from this number",
    "we get the average length of the cut lines at any time . from diffusion theory with the a diffusion coefficient @xmath65 obtained from dynamo theory",
    ", we calculate the rate of spreading of @xmath66 the angle of the cut lines relative to its initial direction .",
    "the time it takes for this average angle to become larger than @xmath67 is the dissipation time of the flux . on comparing with the standard value for the dynamo growth time we can test whether the dissipation time is shorter or longer than the dynamo time of the models .",

    "now @xmath117 , the mass of this area , is constant under the lagrangian displacement , and equals @xmath118 .",
    "the pressure force has the components @xmath119 and @xmath120 , with @xmath121 also a constant .",

    "when the finite thickness of the shell @xmath86 is taken into account the growth rate is given by @xmath130 so that the maximum growth rate occurs when @xmath131 , and is @xmath132 .",
    "using equation  ( [ eq : b ] ) for @xmath86 we find the linear growth time of the spike is @xmath133 million years .",
    "we need the nonlinear development of the solution to study the escape of mass out of the galaxy .",
    "the nonlinear limit of our equations is @xmath134 to solve these equations , set @xmath135    then the nonlinear equations become @xmath136    canceling @xmath137 in the first equation , we get @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a constant to be determined .",

    ", both @xmath124 and @xmath12 diverge . before this happens",
    ", the velocity reaches the escape velocity and the top of the spike moves ballistically out of the galaxy . setting the upward velocity @xmath147 at @xmath148 and @xmath149 , equal to @xmath150 , ( binney and tremaine 1987 ) we have @xmath151 so taking @xmath152 we have @xmath153    the height , @xmath154 , at which this happens is @xmath155    at the same time the plasma at the top has spread out , and thus , the magnetic field originally trapped on the top will also have spread out .",
    "its strength is weakened by a power of @xmath156 at the time @xmath157 .",
    "as a result of a single spike , a line has been cut .",
    "see figure 3 .",
    "we will first estimate the number of cuts made by a single spike , then the number of cuts per superbubble , and then the rate of cuts in a cubic kiloparsec .",
    "how many cuts does a single spike make ? from the previous section we see that the top of the spike will be accelerated to the escape velocity , and leave the galaxy , dragging its embedded flux with it .",
    "these lines will still be connected to the disc and each removed line will produce a cut in a disc line .",
    "let us take the initial horizontal diameter of the spike to be @xmath158 .",
    "now , the lines in a spike will be those that come from the top half of its fragment , which in turn come from the top half of that part of the initial galactic field above the galactic midplane .",
    "in general , we do not know the vertical profile of the structure of the disc field ( which is determined by the dynamo theory ) .",
    "but it must have the same profile as the initial flux in the spike .",
    "let the initial flux in the spike be @xmath159 where the profile factor @xmath160 would be one if the field were uniform .",
    "thus , the initial number of lines in the spike is @xmath161    as the spike grows , the mass on the top slides downward along its sides , and at the escape time , the surface density is reduced by a factor of @xmath162 where @xmath163 is given by equation  ( [ eq : i ] ) .",
    "although the surface density decreases by @xmath162 , the number of field lines decreases only by one power of @xmath163 . this is because in one direction , the mass flows along the field lines .",
    "the lines are only removed from the top by motions in a transverse direction to the field .",
    "remember we are dealing with extremely weak fields , so the velocities are axisymmetric and the fields have no affect on them .    from equation  ( [ eq : i ] )",
    "we see that in the planer single - spike solution , the spike will expand by approximately thirty times .",
    "it is unlikely that the solution is valid to such a large distance , but the thinning out of the flux and density about the origin is locally correct .",
    "since i am uncertain what terminates the nonlinear solution in the horizontal direction , i conservatively assume that the flux is ejected from the galaxy at least a distance @xmath164 from the origin , where @xmath165 is a factor greater than one .",
    "thus , the flux which is removed from the galaxy by a single spike and the number of resulting cuts is @xmath166    next , the number of cuts per superbubble is the number of cuts per spike times the number of fragments times the probability @xmath9 that each fragment will have a spike .",
    "thus , @xmath167    now , using ( equation  ( [ eq : m ] ) the number of cuts per unit area summed over all @xmath57 , is @xmath168    to get the number of cuts per unit time of any individual line in the upper quarter of the disc , we consider an annulus of radius 8.5 @xmath169 , thickness @xmath63 and width @xmath170 .",
    "the rate of cuts in this annulus is @xmath171    the initial number of lines in the top _ quarter _ of the disc and in this annulus is    @xmath172    clearly , @xmath173 , the total of cuts which any line in the annulus suffers in @xmath174 is @xmath175 the profile factor , @xmath160 has dropped out of this ratio .    the average length of every line segment after @xmath174 is @xmath176",
    "we now consider how fast the cut lines can rotate in order to remove the _",
    "net _ flux due to them .",
    "this rotation occurs in the disc and is produced by turbulent diffusion there .",
    "the disc diffusion coefficient is included in all previous work .",
    "is has usually been estimated from the observed properties of interstellar turbulence , but the magnitude of this turbulence is uncertain . in the meantime ferrire",
    "has carried out a more deductive derivation of it that is produced by the fluid motions produced by supernova and superbubble explosions .",
    "( ferrire 1993 ) . characterizing the effective turbulence by the disc diffusion coefficient @xmath65 .",
    "she finds v @xmath177 .",
    "this diffusion coefficient is much smaller than the halo coefficient , discussed in section 3 , and is the same as the beta in the dynamo equations ( [ eq : a ] ) .",
    "consider any given cut portion of a line aligned along any axis .",
    "each end will be displaced by the interstellar turbulence , a perpendicular amount whose standard deviation is @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , the line will be rotated from an initial direction by an angle @xmath66 whose standard deviation is @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the time in @xmath181 years .    the dissipation time , @xmath182 , is found by setting @xmath183 .",
    "this is the time when all the relevant flux is diffused to zero .",
    "@xmath184    this estimate for @xmath182 shows that the time to dissipate the flux is of order of a billion years .",
    "in deriving it , i make use of certain assumptions that are quantified by the parameters :    * @xmath9 , the probability that a fragment will have a spike instability , which is equal to the probability that the fragments holds their superbubble pressure for a time @xmath185 , [ see equation  ( [ eq : h ] ) ] . *",
    "@xmath186 , the size of the fragments normalized to @xmath187 . *",
    "@xmath188 , the shell temperature normalized to 300 degrees kelvin .",
    "* @xmath165 , the radius of the top of the spike at the escape time normalized to @xmath189 .",
    "these parameters are included in equation  ( [ eq : k ] ) .",
    "their values are uncertain and and represent its uncertainty . in particular , if the spike instability did not occur at all ( because all the fragments lose their superbubble pressure too rapidly ) , then @xmath9 would be zero , equation  ( [ eq : k ] ) for @xmath182 would be infinite , and the spike hypothesis of this paper would not work .    for comparison",
    "let us take an estimate of the dynamo time @xmath190 equal to the growth time , from one of the referenced papers in section 1 , ( brandenburg et .",
    "al . 1992 ) .",
    "@xmath191 a time considerably shorter than a billion years .",
    "thus , if the brandenburg et .",
    "galactic dynamo is inhibited by flux - freezing and the galactic gravitational field , it still can work using this new process , but with a longer growth time given by @xmath182 .",
    "although we can not determine the values of the parameters , we can make certain remarks .",
    "first @xmath9 is the most uncertain parameter since the analytic details of the fragmentation are not known .",
    "@xmath9 must be less than one , but is probably bigger than one third .",
    "the parameter @xmath165 is definitely larger than one but less than @xmath192 since @xmath193 is the radius of the fragment .",
    "it is probably considerably larger than one .",
    "one might assume that the factors @xmath9 and @xmath165 cancel .",
    "@xmath103 which has been determined by comparison with the actual simulation of mac low et .",
    "1989 ) is probably not far from one .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to believe that @xmath182 is directly proportional to @xmath188 .",
    "@xmath188 can easily be as small as 1/3 if the shell temperature is @xmath194 or as large as three if the temperature 1000k so this probably gives a plausible range for @xmath182 .",
    "thus , one might have either @xmath182 is comparable with @xmath195 in which case the previous values for the dynamo time are believable , or it may be much larger and the dynamo would be correspondingly slower . some detailed numerical simulations are probably necessary to decide which is the case .    how does one analytically combine our result for @xmath182 with the alpha - omega differential equation  ( [ eq : a ] ) ?",
    "the simplest way is to modify these equations by adding terms @xmath196 and @xmath197 to the right hand sides of the two equations when @xmath198 .",
    "in addition , one must include the mass flow expressed in terms of the flux flow from the flux - freezing condition , and the gravitational field",
    ". it should be acceptable to use _ vacuum boundary conditions _ on the edge of the halo .",
    "this leads to a modification of the standard approach and should be more realistic .",
    "the broken pieces of flux from one growth phase will not interfere with the next growth phase because the strength of their fields are relatively small .",
    "this only holds during amplification .",
    "when the stronger field is approached , the spike instability saturates and one can no longer neglect the residual field in the disc even after it is dissipated .",
    "this will probably saturate the dynamo as well , since @xmath182 would be much longer , and the boundaries would become completely closed . assuming saturation at the present epoch these loose _ finite _ pieces could be responsible for the random fields measured by rand and kulkarni ( 1988 ) .",
    "incidentally , we can calculate the length of the cut lines averaged over a decay time .",
    "this is given by averaging equation  ( [ eq : n ] ) over @xmath182 , and is equal to the length at @xmath182 , multiplied by a logarithmic factor which is two or three .",
    "this length of only a few kpc is about the bulk distance cosmic rays can propagate during their lifetime .",
    "these cut lines remaining after saturation suggest a natural method for cosmic rays to escape from the disc .",
    "i have shown by a simple example that , when flux - freezing and the gravitational field are present the rate of expulsion of flux in previous galactic dynamo theories , can be strongly inhibited by the mass on the the outflowing flux falling back from the halo into the disc . a crude estimate of this inhibition is given by equation  ( [ eq : bb ] ) which indicates that if the halo diffusion coefficient is much less than @xmath199 the outflow will be completely inhibited .",
    "however , in this case the dynamo may be saved by another process based on a spike instability arising from the fragmentation of those superbubble that succeed in breaking out of the disc .",
    "this instability can expel a very short length of a line of force , cutting the rest of the line in two . if a line is cut into short enough pieces they can rotate horizontally in the disc , dissipating their net flux and removing it from playing any role in the dynamo .",
    "this turns out to be equivalent to expelling the line as far as the dynamo is concerned .",
    "an estimate of how many cuts occur shows that the relevant amount of flux can be removed in a time of order of a billion years .",
    "thus , the dynamo can still operate , but on this longer time scale , to grow the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the two processes , the alpha- omega dynamo and the flux annihilation by cutting fields , can be combined in a systematic theory .",
    "one merely has to add terms giving the annihilation rate , to dynamo equations , and assume boundary condition the compatible with the inhibition of the flux expulsion .",
    "incidentally , the method of dissipating flux without removing mass may apply to other dynamos , such as the solar dynamo , in which the flux is confined by flux - freezing , and one does not want to remove an appreciable fraction of the mass of an object to produce its dynamo .",
    "although no direct observational evidence is produced for this model it may have indirect consequences of importance such as an explanation for why the observed random magnetic fields are larger than the mean field .",
    "also the cut fields may provide an escape route for cosmic rays .",
