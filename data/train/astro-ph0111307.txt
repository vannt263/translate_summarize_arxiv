    "the dwarf irregular galaxy ugc 4483 can also be classified as a cometary blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy in the morphological classification scheme of loose & thuan ( 1986 ) : the high - surface - brightness starburst region at the northern end of the galaxy represents the `` head '' of the comet while its low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) elongated body represents its `` tail '' . with equatorial coordinates @xmath6(j2000 ) = 08@xmath737@xmath8030 , @xmath9(j2000 ) = + 694631 , it lies roughly midway between m81 ( 78 away ) and ngc 2403 ( 73 away ) and likely belongs to the m81 group of galaxies .",

    "we obtained _ hst _ images of ugc 4483 on 2000 august 12 during cycle 9 with the wfpc2 through filters f555w and f814w , which we will refer to hereafter as @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath0 exposure was broken up in seven sub - exposures and the @xmath1 filter in five sub - exposures to permit identification and removal of cosmic rays .",
    "the total exposure time was 9500s in @xmath0 and 6900s in @xmath1 .",
    "the galaxy was positioned on the pc frame so that the high - surface - brightness starburst region is at its north corner .",
    "the orientation of the wfpc2 has been chosen so that the major axis of the galaxy lies along the diagonals of the pc and wf3 frames .",
    "some parts of ugc 4483 were imaged also on the wf2 , wf3 and wf4 frames .",
    "the scale is 0046 per pixel for the pc frame and 0102 per pixel for the wf frames .",
    "preliminary processing of the raw images including flat - fielding was done at the space telescope science institute through the standard pipeline .",
    "subsequent reductions were carried out at the main astronomical observatory of the ukrainian academy of sciences using iraf and stsdas .",
    "cosmic rays were removed and the images in each filter were combined using the crrej routine .",
    "we found that all exposures in a given filter coregistered to better than @xmath5 0.2 pixels .    in fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] we show pc @xmath1 and @xmath19 images where the prominent background galaxy is marked by a circle .",
    "the dark regions in the @xmath19 image are young regions with ongoing star formation and ionized gas emission .",
    "they have a patchy structure implying non - uniform dust extinction .    the superior spatial resolution of the _ hst _ wfpc2 images combined with the proximity of ugc 4483 permits to resolve individual stars and study stellar populations in this galaxy by means of cmds .",
    "we used the daophot package in iraf for point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting photometry .",
    "the psfs are derived using the brightest stars in each frame .",
    "there are many bright and relatively uncrowded stars in the pc frame , resulting in a reliable psf .",
    "the psfs for the wf frames are not as reliable because of the lack of bright isolated stars .",
    "the measured full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the stellar profiles are different for the pc and wf frames and for different filters .",

    "the corresponding fwhms for the wf frames are 1.5 pixels and 1.7 pixels .",
    "the background level in the pc field was measured in an annulus with radii 21 and 25 pixels ( 097 and 115 ) around each source and subtracted .",
    "these radii are large enough so that the background annulus is free of contamination from the extended wings of the stellar profiles .",
    "we have checked that this is the case by using a background annulus closer to the source , with radii of 11 and 15 pixels ( 051 and 069 ) .",
    "the measured magnitudes with the larger annulus are @xmath18 0.005 mag brighter than those obtained with the smaller annulus , implying that the wings of the stellar profiles do not contaminate the background appreciably at radii @xmath20 05 .",
    "the sky level in the wf fields was measured in an annulus with radii 11 and 15 pixels ( 112 and 153 ) .",
    "we also experimented with a smaller background annulus with radii 6 and 11 pixels ( 061 and 112 ) and did not find differences in the measured magnitudes , implying again that the wings of the stellar profiles do not contaminate the background for radii @xmath20 05 .",

    "@xmath22 = 0.37 mag and @xmath23(05 ) ",
    "@xmath24 = 0.60 mag . for the wf frames the corresponding corrections",

    "our derived corrections are very similar to those obtained by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995a ) .",
    "stars with @xmath25 greater than 4.0 and a sharpness out of the 1.0  + 1.0 range in both pc and wf frames were eliminated to minimize the number of false detections .",
    "correction for charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) loss has been done according to the prescriptions of dolphin ( 2000a ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the distribution of photometric errors as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes as determined by daophot .",
    "it is seen that errors are about 0.2 mag at @xmath0 = 27.5 mag and @xmath1 = 26.5 mag for both pc and wf frames .",
    "they increase to about 0.4 mag at @xmath0 = 28.5 mag and @xmath1 = 27.5 mag .",
    "we have excluded stars with photometric errors larger than 0.2 mag in the final photometric list for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 images .",
    "the total numbers of recovered stars in both pc and wf frames are respectively 7672 , 5411 and 3853 in the @xmath0 image , the @xmath1 image and in both of these images at the same time .",
    "the corresponding numbers of recovered stars in the pc frame only are 4508 , 2985 and 2250 .",
    "we have adopted a matching radius of 1 pixel , although changing that radius within the range 0.5 - 2 pixels does not change the number of stars in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 frames appreciably .",
    "that nearly half the stars are not matched is likely to be caused by incompleteness effect and an increasing number of false detections at faint magnitudes . indeed , the number of the stars with @xmath0 = 25  26 mag recovered in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 images is @xmath5 85% that recovered in the @xmath0 image alone , while the number of the stars with @xmath0 = 27  28 mag recovered in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 images is only @xmath5 15% that recovered in the @xmath0 image alone .",
    "the transformation of instrumental magnitudes to the johnson - cousins @xmath26 photometric system as defined by landolt ( 1992 ) was performed according to the prescriptions of holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995b ) and dolphin ( 2000a ) . the magnitudes and colors of point sources",
    "were corrected for galactic interstellar extinction adopting @xmath27 = 0.11 mag ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) .",
    "we have carried out a completeness analysis for the pc and wf4 frames using the daophot routine addstar . for each frame",
    "we have added artificial stars amounting to @xmath5 5% of the real stars detected in each magnitude bin in the original image .",
    "we then performed a new photometric reduction using the same procedure as the one applied to the original frame , and checked how many added stars were recovered .",
    "this operation was repeated 10 times for each frame and each magnitude bin and the results were averaged . the completeness factor in each magnitude bin defined as the percentage of recovered artificial stars is shown in table 1 .",
    "it can be seen that the completeness limit is reasonably good : it is about 67%  70% in @xmath0 and 45%  55% in @xmath1 in the 26  27 mag range , but drops to @xmath5 41%  44% and @xmath5 7% ",
    "15% in the 27  28 mag range .",
    "in fig . [ fig4 ] we show @xmath28 vs @xmath29 cmds of ugc 4483 in all wfpc2 frames .",
    "the cmd for the pc frame is well populated by both young main sequence stars and older red giant branch ( rgb ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "such populations have also been detected and discussed by dolphin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) from less deep @xmath0 and @xmath1 _ hst_/wfpc2 images .",
    "the cmds in the wf frames are less populated , with a dominant contribution from rgb and agb stars , although younger stellar populations are present .",
    "the detection of rgb stars allows in principle to derive the distance to the galaxy using the apparent magnitude @xmath28 of the tip of rgb stars ( trgb ) .",
    "this technique is based on the observed constancy of the absolute magnitude @xmath30 @xmath31 4.0 mag of trgb stars in old globular stellar clusters ( da costa & armandroff 1990 ) .",
    "there is evidently a sharp drop in the rgb distribution toward brighter @xmath28 magnitudes in the pc , wf2 and wf3 frames ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a  [ fig4]c ) .",
    "however the drop is not so evident in the wf4 frame ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]d ) because of the large number of agb stars atop the rgb tip .",
    "therefore , care has been taken to minimize the contribution of agb stars and more massive red helium burning ( rheb ) stars in the determination of @xmath28(trgb ) .",
    "for all frames , we have derived the distribution of the rgb stars located in the cmd to the red of the straight line defined by the pair of points @xmath28,@xmath29 = ( 27,0.4 ) and ( 22,1.5 ) to exclude the contribution of the rheb stars , and to the blue of the straight line defined by @xmath28,@xmath29 = ( 27,0.8 ) and ( 22,1.9 ) to reduce the contribution of the agb stars .",
    "the distribution of stars in the combined pc , wf2 , wf3 , wf4 frames in steps @xmath32@xmath28 = 0.1 mag is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] by a solid line .",
    "the derivative of the distribution is shown by a dotted line .",
    "the location of the trgb is determined by the first large increase in both the rgb luminosity function and its derivative , and is shown by a vertical tick mark .",
    "the @xmath28(trgb ) is 23.65 @xmath3 0.10 mag .",
    "we also experimented with luminosity functions produced with different binnings , @xmath32@xmath28 = 0.2 and 0.4 mag . the larger @xmath32@xmath28 result in more monotonic luminosity functions , but the value of the @xmath28(trgb ) is unchanged .",
    "it is 0.09 mag fainter , but is consistent within the errors with the one of 23.56 @xmath3 0.10 mag derived by dolphin et al .",

    "we conclude that , in addition to a strong recent burst of star formation as evidenced by the presence of the supergiant h ii region , star formation has occured during at least the last 2 gyr in region 1 . alternatively ,",
    "if the metallicity of the stars is significantly lower than that of the gas , then our age estimates could be significantly larger .",
    "similar conclusions regarding the star formation history can be made for regions 2 to 5 ( fig .",

    "a large part of the galaxy around the supergiant h ii region shows evidence for continuous star formation during at least the last 2 gyr .",
    "the exception is region 6 which is characterized by a low density of stars , and where mainly @xmath42 2 gyr rgb stars are present .",
    "it is likely that star formation never occurred in this region and the rgb stars migrated there from denser regions of the galaxy .",
    "rgb and agb stars are good tracers of the star formation history of ugc 4483 during the last several hundred myr ( agb stars ) to @xmath42 2 gyr ( rgb stars ) . if there are no older stellar populations in the galaxy , then it can be considered as a relatively young galaxy , since a 2 gyr age is much lower than the age of the universe .",
    "unfortunately , the galaxy is too far away for _ hst _ to detect the red giant clump and horizontal - branch stars which are good indicators of stellar populations older than several gyr .",
    "therefore , our discussion of the age of ugc 4483 will have to rely on the observed rgb and agb stellar populations .",
    "it will be by necessity more qualitative than quantitative .",
    "this is because of the age - metallicity degeneracy of rgb star colors , the poor knowledge of the properties of agb stars and the uncertainties in the theoretical isochrones .",
    "we have already pointed out that the most striking feature in the cmd of ugc 4483 is that the rgb stars are very blue .",
    "the @xmath2 color of the trgb as measured in the pc frame is only 1.3 mag ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]a ) , bluer than the color of the trgb of old galactic globular clusters ( @xmath42 1.4 mag ) .",
    "the @xmath2 color of the trgb in the wf frames , though slightly redder , is 1.35 mag , or 0.05 mag bluer than the trgb color of the globular cluster m15 with metallicity [ fe / h ] = 2.17 .",
    "such blue colors of the rgb stars can be explained in two ways : 1 ) by a very low metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath5 2.4 and an old age , or 2 ) by a higher metallicity and a younger age ( @xmath40 10 gyr ) .",
    "let s first consider case 1 . if we suppose that the rgb stars in ugc 4483 are 10 gyr old , then the extremely low metallicity required to produce their relatively blue colors is not easily understood .",
    "while stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath5 2.4 can not be excluded in principle , they are rare in the milky way and in other well - studied nearby galaxies .",
    "there is an additional problem : if the slightly redder colors of the rgb stars seen in the wf frames is a real effect due to a higher metallicity , why would stars seen in the periphery of ugc 4483 which are likely to be older be more metal - rich as compared to the younger rgb stars in the main body of the galaxy ?",
    "it is more plausible that case 2 prevails , that the blue colors of the rgb stars in ugc 4483 are caused by their younger age rather than by their lower metallicity . in that case , the metallicity of the ionized gas , while being probably higher than the stellar metallicity , may still be a reasonable approximation for the metallicity of the rgb stars . then , using models with @xmath16 = 0.001 from bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , we derive an age for the rgb stars of @xmath5 2 gyr .",

    "while our cmds do not show evidence for stellar populations older than @xmath5 2 gyr , they do not go deep enough to definitively rule them out .",
    "agb stars are tracers of the intermediate and old stellar populations .",

    "there are no theoretical isochrones that can reproduce well the observed properties of agb stars at low metallicities ( e.g. , lynds et al . 1998 ) .",

    "again , as in the case of the rgb stars , we find that the stellar populations seen in ugc 4483 are likely not to be older than @xmath5 2 gyr , an age which is considerably smaller than the age of the universe and which suggests that ugc 4483 is probably a relatively young galaxy as compared to other dwarf galaxies .      another way to study the properties of stellar populations is to consider their integrated characteristics as given by the surface brightness and color profiles in different regions in the galaxy .",

    "we now compare the asymptotic value of @xmath2 with the integrated colors of the globular clusters considered before in section 3 . from the catalogue of galactic globular clusters of harris ( 1996 ) we obtained extinction - corrected @xmath2 of 0.72 , 0.80 , 0.84 , 0.88 , 0.98 and 1.09 mag respectively for the m15 , ngc 6397 , m2 , ngc 6752 ,",

    "their argument is based on the observed constancy of the n / o and c / o ratios with o / h .",
    "izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) argued that the constancy meant that carbon and nitrogen in these metal - deficient galaxies are made by the same massive stars responsible for oxygen production .",
    "in other words , intermediate - mass ( 3@xmath51 @xmath18 @xmath11 @xmath18 9@xmath51 ) stars have not had the time to release their nucleosynthetic products , which puts an upper limit of @xmath18 40 myr , the main - sequence lifetime of a 9@xmath51 star .",
    "however , there are several reasons to believe that the above age upper limit is too low .",
    "first , the major nitrogen production is not by 8@xmath51 stars , but by 3  4@xmath51 stars ( e.g. , marigo 2001 ) , increasing the time - scale for nitrogen enrichment of the interstellar medium by intermediate - mass stars to at least to @xmath5 150  400 myr .",
    "second , some additional time of @xmath18 1 gyr ( roy & kunth 1995 ) should be allowed for the mixing of fresh nitrogen to the interstellar medium .",
    "other possibilities can be considered for reconciling the chemical abundance considerations with the age of ugc 4483 .",
    "one possible way out is to note that chemical evolution models of dwarf galaxies follow the time evolution of local characteristics or assume instantaneous recycling of the matter . in particular , in closed - box models both oxygen and nitrogen are produced at the same place .",
    "however , judging from the spatial distribution of main - sequence stars and agb stars in ugc 4483 ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) , this assumption may not be hold for this galaxy .",
    "the massive main sequence stars which are the main contributors to the interstellar medium of oxygen and probably of primary nitrogen ( izotov & thuan 1999 ) are located in very compact regions of the galaxy , while the agb stars occupy a much larger volume . this may result in a volume dilution of the nitrogen produced by agb stars as compared to the oxygen and primary nitrogen produced by massive stars , decreasing the relative contribution of nitrogen by agb stars . other scenarios of nitrogen enrichment have been discussed , but they can not account for the very small dispersion of the n / o and c / o ratios in very metal - deficient galaxies and the increase in scatter of those ratios in higher - metallicity galaxies ( e.g. , pilyugin 1999 ; henry , edmunds & kppen 2000 ) .",
    "we note also that the asymptotic @xmath19 of @xmath5 0.7 of ugc 4483 is the reddest color of all values derived thus far in our long - term study of the stellar populations in extremely metal - deficient bcds , those with @xmath16 @xmath18 @xmath15/20 ( izotov & thuan 1999 ) .",

    "( 1999 ) first noted that the red agb stars are located in the south - eastern part of the galaxy .",
    "we confirm this result .",
    "we also note that these agb stars are detected in the same crowded regions where bluer and younger stars are present .",
    "such a distribution is very different from that seen in ugc 4483 , vii zw 403 ( lynds et al . 1998",
    "; schulte - ladbeck et al . 1998 ) , ugca 290 ( crone et al . 2000 ) and ngc 2366 ( thuan & izotov 2001 ) where the rgb and agb stars are spread out over significantly larger areas as compared to the younger stars . this difference in spatial distribution may be an indication that agb stars in i zw 18 have had no time to diffuse far away from their origin and hence may be significantly younger than 1 gyr .",
    "the compact distribution of the agb stars and their conspicuous absence at larger distances in non - crowded regions where they can be more easily detected , also argue against the idea that i zw 18 possesses an extended low - surface - brightness disk of red stars ( legrand 2000 ; kunth & stlin 2000 ) .",
    "deeper images ( by 12 mag ) of i zw 18 are required to check for the presence or absence of rgb stars in this bcd and settle the controversy on its age .",

    "hst _ observations of nearby galaxies with resolved stellar populations have not revealed ones as young as @xmath18 100 myr as suggested by izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) from chemical arguments .",
    "however , there is evidence that suggests that some nearby dwarf galaxies , like i zw 18 , sbs 0335052 and ugc 4483 have ages which are significantly smaller than the age of the universe ( @xmath18 2 gyr ) , and in that sense , can be considered as young galaxies .",
    "we present a photometric study of the resolved stellar populations in the nearby cometary blue compact dwarf galaxy ugc 4483 based on _ hubble space telescope _ wfpc2 @xmath0 and @xmath1 images .",
    "the analysis of the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for this galaxy have led us to the following conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "the cmd of ugc 4483 is populated by the stars with different ages including the youngest hydrogen - burning main - sequence stars , evolved massive stars with core helium burning ( blue - loop stars and red supergiants ) , and older red giants and asymptotic giant helium - shell burning stars .",
    "hence , there was continuous star formation in ugc 4483 during a long period , for at least the last 2 gyr .",
    "\\2 . from the observed @xmath1 magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) of 23.65 @xmath3 0.10 mag",
    ", we derive a distance modulus @xmath4 = 27.63 @xmath3 0.11 corresponding to a distance of 3.4 @xmath3 0.2 mpc and suggesting that ugc 4483 is a member of the m81 group of galaxies",
    "the @xmath2 color of the red giant stars in ugc 4483 is comparatively very blue , with a trgb @xmath2 = 1.3 mag implying a very low metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath5 2.4 ) and/or a young age of the rgb stars .",
    "we argue for a young age of @xmath5 2 gyr .",
    "the agb stars in ugc 4483 are significantly brighter than those observed in other dwarf galaxies with similar metallicities .",
    "they are , for example , @xmath5 0.3 mag brighter than those seen in the bcds vii zw 403 and ugca 290 . assuming the stars have the same metallicity as the ionized gas",
    ", the higher luminosities suggest that the agb stars in ugc 4483 are about a factor of 2 younger than those in vii zw 403 and ugca 290 .",
    "we do not find evidence for stellar populations older than 2 gyr in ugc 4483 , although our data is not deep enough to detect the indicators of older stellar populations such as red giant clump and horizontal - branch stars .",
    "comparison of the stellar populations of ugc 4483 with those in other nearby dwarf galaxies suggests that it is likely to be one of the youngest among the bcds and dwarf irregular galaxies with detected rgb and agb stars .",
    "alternatively , the differences in the cmd of ugc 4483 can also be explained by an abnormally low metallicity of the stars in the bcd , [ fe / h ] = 2.4 , comparable to the most metal - deficient globular cluster stars .",
