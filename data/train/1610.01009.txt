    "the photosphere of cool ( @xmath3k ) helium - rich white dwarfs reaches fluid - like densities ( up to a few  g/@xmath2 ) @xcite . under such conditions , collective interactions between particles are no longer negligible , which leads to an alteration of opacities , chemical abundances and the equation of state .    in recent years",
    ", many of these non - ideal effects have been investigated .",
    "these include corrections to the free - free absorption by he@xmath4 and to rayleigh scattering @xcite , high - pressure line profiles for ca , mg and na @xcite , high - density uv opacities for hydrogen @xcite , radiative transfer with refraction @xcite , non - ideal dissociation equilibrium of molecular hydrogen @xcite , ionization of helium @xcite , pressure distortion of @xmath5 swan bands @xcite and infrared absorption of dense helium @xcite .    however , even when taking these effects into account , current atmosphere models are unable to reproduce the spectra of several cool dz , dqpec and ultracool white dwarfs .",
    "this suggests that the physics and chemistry included in present atmosphere models is still incomplete .",
    "therefore , to use these stars as cosmochronometers or to access the bulk composition of rocky material accreted on their surface , more fundamental research on the behavior of matter under these conditions is required .    here",
    "we discuss new ab initio calculations that reveal significant deviations from the ideal gas limit for both the ionization of heavy elements and the h@xmath0-he collision - induced absorption spectrum .",
    "for the ionization of species @xmath6 to @xmath7 , minimization of the helmholtz free energy leads to the condition , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the chemical potential of species @xmath10 . in general",
    ", @xmath9 can be expressed as the sum of an ideal and a non - ideal component , @xmath11 the non - ideal component is itself the sum of two terms : an _ entropy term _ , which reflects the excluded volume of the species and an _ interaction term _ , which describes the energy of the interaction of the species with surrounding particles . in the low - density limit",
    ", @xmath12 can be neglected and equation [ eq : muioniz ] leads to the well - known saha ionization equilibrium equation .",
    "however , to properly describe the ionization of metals under the photospheric densities of cool dz stars , @xmath12 must be taken into account .",
    "@xmath13 has already been computed by @xcite using ab initio methods and agrees well with existing experimental data . to compute @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    ", we solved the orstein - zernike equation following the procedure outlined in @xcite using pair potentials computed with the orca package @xcite at the ccsd(t ) level .",
    "our results , reported in terms of the ionization ratio , are given in figure [ fig : ioniz ] .",
    "for every element considered , we find that the ionization fraction deviates from the ideal gas approximation by several orders of magnitude for the conditions encountered at the photosphere of cool dz stars .",
    "figure [ fig : ioniz ] shows that at 1g/@xmath2 , ionization is inhibited for most heavy elements .",
    "this rather unexpected result is primarily due to the high interaction energy of electrons with helium and should be validated by spectral fits or relevant experimental studies .",
    "a dipole moment is induced when a collision between particles ( in our case , h@xmath0 and he ) occurs , which results in infrared ( ir ) absorption known as collision - induced absorption ( cia ) . to compute cia opacities , previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) relied on potential energy and induced dipole surfaces computed in the infinite - dilution limit . at high density ( > 0.1g/@xmath2 ) , this approximation can break down .    to check the effect of many - particle collisions , we performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of cia opacities using the procedure and computational setup of @xcite .",
    "numerous simulations were performed for different @xmath17 conditions . for each simulation ,",
    "the cubic supercell contained one h@xmath0 molecule and either 31 or 63 he atoms and the simulation box length was chosen to obtain the desired density .",
    "for each 0.5fs timestep , the total dipole moment @xmath18 of the simulation supercell was computed .",
    "the ir spectrum was then obtained through the fourier transform of the dipole moment autocorrelation function @xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the absorption coefficient , @xmath21 the wavenumber , @xmath22 the speed of light in the fluid , @xmath23 the boltzmann constant , @xmath24 the temperature , @xmath25 the supercell volume and the angle brackets denote the time - correlation function , i.e. @xmath26 .    as figure [ fig : cia ] shows , the cia spectrum is significantly distorted for densities encountered at the photosphere of cool helium - rich white dwarfs ( > 0.1g/@xmath2 ) .",
    "this affects the near - ir and ir spectra of cool white dwarfs , as discussed by kowalski et al . in these proceedings .",
    "we found that the length of the h@xmath0 bond is reduced by @xmath2715% when density is raised from 0.1 to 2g/@xmath2 .",
    "this compression of the h@xmath0 molecule shifts its rovibronic levels , which might explain the cia spectrum distortion .",
    "in addition , under high - density conditions , triple collisions become important and increase the absorption coefficient @xcite . from figure",
    "[ fig : cia ] , it is also apparent that the fundamental band is split at high density .",
    "this has already been experimentally observed @xcite and it is explained by the interference resulting from correlations between dipole moments induced between successive collisions @xcite .",
    "using state - of - the - art ab initio calculations , we find yet unaccounted high - density effects that alter the ionization equilibrium of heavy elements and the shape of the h@xmath0-he cia spectrum in the atmosphere of cool helium - rich white dwarfs .",
    "these non - ideal effects will modify the synthetic spectra computed by atmosphere models and , therefore , effective temperature and chemical abundances inferred from observations will also be affected .",
    "many more non - ideal effects still have to be taken into account ( e.g. , additional metal line profiles at high density , non - ideal dissociation of c@xmath0 , etc . ) .",
    "once all the most important non - ideal effects are included in our models , they will be used to properly analyse cool dz , dqpec and ultracool white dwarfs .",
