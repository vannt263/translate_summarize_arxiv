    "within the past few years the number of known brown dwarfs has increased dramatically , with both the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) and two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) accounting for the bulk of the discoveries .",
    "these objects have been identified based on broad - band photometry with follow - up optical and near - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "the integrated data from these investigations has yielded important information about the variation of the chemical composition and of the effects of condensates in brown dwarfs in term of their spectral types ( e. g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "spectroscopic observations in the mid - infrared yield important additional information @xcite , but due to the very low infrared brightness of these objects and the effects of the earth s atmospheric absorption these measurements have been difficult or impossible from ground - based observatories . with the launch of the spitzer space telescope @xcite and the onboard infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on 2003 august 25 , we now have an observatory with sufficient sensitivity to undertake these studies .",
    "accordingly , the science team of the irs has organized a comprehensive observational program of m , l , and t dwarfs , covering the range from the earliest m dwarfs to the latest t dwarfs .",
    "we present here the first results from this program : observations of the m3.5 star gj 1001a ( lhs 102a ) , the l8 dwarf denis - p j0255@xmath04700 ( hereafter j0255@xmath04700 ) , and the t1/t6 binary system @xmath1 indi ba / bb .",
    "the three objects described here were observed with the irs instrument on the spitzer space telescope as part of one of the major irs science team guaranteed time observing programs .",
    "the irs is capable of low - and moderate - resolution spectroscopy , with only data from the low - resolution modules being reported here .",
    "each of the irs low - resolution modules is fed by two long slits , one used for first order and the second used for second order .",
    "the irs low - resolution modules have slit lengths of 546 and 1513 for both orders in the short - low ( sl ) and long - low ( ll ) modules , respectively .",
    "the spectral resolution of the sl module as determined by the slit width is @xmath2 = 0.06  for second order and @xmath2 = 0.12  for first order .",
    "the spectral resolution of the ll module as determined by the slit width is @xmath2 = 0.17  for second order and @xmath2 = 0.32  for first order .",
    "the slit widths of both of the irs low - resolution modules are nyquist sampled by the pixel pitch of their infrared arrays .",
    "@xcite describe the design , performance , and operation of the irs in more detail .",
    "table 1 provides a summary of the observations reported here .",
    "as all of these objects have relatively large proper motions , the irs blue peakup array was used to locate the current positions of these objects and to reposition them into the irs slits with an estimated radial uncertainty of approximately 04 , ( 1@xmath3 ) .",
    "each object was observed at two locations in each of the irs low - resolution slits , with the positions located at approximately the 1/3 and 2/3 positions along the long axis of the slits .",
    "the standard irs data reduction pipeline version s9.1 at the spitzer science center processed the data .",
    "stellar standards were also observed to calibrate the spectra and remove any spectral artifacts which may have survived the processing ; the results reported here were corrected with the a dwarf standard star @xmath4 umi .",
    "the zodiacal and galactic backgrounds were subtracted before the spectral extractions using observations when the target was located in the alternate slit .",
    "finally , the spectra were extracted from the sky - subtracted two - dimensional array images using an early version of the smart irs data - reduction software package being developed at cornell university @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the resulting irs low - resolution spectra for the three objects reported here . at this early stage in the spitzer mission ,",
    "our estimated uncertainty in the absolute photometry is @xmath5 , but the uncertainty in the spectral shape is much less than this .",
    "the caption for figure 1 gives the uncertainties in the spectral shapes which were estimated from a combination of the measured noise in the individual reads of the pixels in the detector arrays and the variation between the spectra extracted from the observations at the two slit positions .",
    "these uncertainties therefore incorporate some measure of the residual systematic uncertainties and spectral flat - fielding errors .",
    "uncertainties in the absolute flux calibration were estimated in different ways for the three objects and are described below .",

    "the various model parameters for each of the spectra are given in the text .",
    "the most noticeable h@xmath6o , ch@xmath7 , and nh@xmath8 bands are marked , although weaker h@xmath6o absorption extends from the blue edge of the figure to 7.0 , and nh@xmath8 absorption in @xmath1 indi ba / bb extends from 8.5   to the red edge of the figure . in the case of gj 1001a",
    "the entire displayed spectrum is dominated by water absorption , while in j0255@xmath04700 water is dominant longward of 9 . in a t1 ( the brightest component of @xmath1 indi b ) ,",
    "nh@xmath8 is present but not strong enough to be visible in the 1215  region , so that longward of 12  the spectral morphology is still primarily due to water absorption .",
    "the strong 7.8  absorption band from ch@xmath7 is evident in both of the cooler objects.,height=432 ]",
    "as the atmospheres of brown dwarfs cool with time , their spectral signatures reflect a progression of changes in their atmospheric chemical equilibrium and condensate structure .",
    "the three dwarfs discussed here provide snapshots of this progression . in an m dwarf such as gj 1001a , the elements o , c , and",
    "n are predominantly found in @xmath9o , co , and @xmath10 and the atmosphere is too warm for condensation of solids ( @xcite ) .",
    "as the effective temperature ( @xmath11 ) falls , a variety of condensates form in the atmosphere , most notably iron and silicates .",
    "these condensates are not expected to be well - mixed through the atmosphere , but rather be found in relatively thin , discrete cloud layers overlying the condensation level ( @xcite ) . as the @xmath11 falls to that of a late l dwarf , such as j0255@xmath04700 ,",
    "the cloud layer is optically thick and affects either directly ( as a major opacity source ) or indirectly ( by altering the atmospheric temperature / pressure profile ) all spectral regions .",
    "the exact spectral signature of the cloud depends both on its vertical thickness and the particle size distribution of the condensates .",
    "in addition as the atmosphere cools chemical equilibrium begins to favor first @xmath12 over co and then @xmath13 over @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the strong mid - infrared bands of these molecules begin to challenge the domination of water opacity , at least in some spectral regions , by the late l s . by the early to",
    "mid t dwarfs , such as the @xmath1 indi pair , the condensate cloud is forming quite deep in the atmosphere . in the relatively clear , cool atmosphere above the cloud",
    ", chemical equilibrium begins to strongly favor @xmath12 and @xmath13 and their spectral features , along with particularly strong bands of water , grow in prominence ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the resulting pronounced changes in the mid - infrared spectral morphology between the three objects .",
    "the spectra and comparisons with synthetic spectra are considered for each of the objects in turn .",
    "gj 1001a is classified as an m3.5 v star @xcite and is part of a binary system with the l5 dwarf gj 1001b @xcite .",
    "the distance between the primary and secondary is large enough ( 18 ) that there is no contamination of the primary s spectrum by stray light from the secondary . using optical and near - infrared spectra , leggett et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find a best fit to this object with @xmath11 = 3200 k and @xmath14 using a mixing length parameter of 2 in the ames - dusty models of allard et al .",
    "figure 2 compares this same model , smoothed to a spectral resolution of @xmath15 , with the irs data .",
    "the 6.5  feature seen in the irs spectrum also appears in the model and arises from h@xmath16o opacity .    for the object gj 1001a",
    "the near - infrared observations @xcite can be used with the model and the resulting predicted photometric flux compared with our observations .",
    "although the shape of the model spectrum is an excellent match to the irs data , the model fluxes derived from the near - infrared observations had to be scaled by a factor of 0.87 to fit the observed data .",
    "the near - infrared flux levels are consistent with the @xmath11 and radius derived from the luminosity if the dwarf is older than 0.15 gyr @xcite .",
    "j0255@xmath04700 is classified optically as an l8 dwarf .",
    "unfortunately the trigonometric parallax distance of this object has not been measured .",
    "considerable structure can be seen in the irs spectrum and to interpret these results we have compared the irs data with the model described by @xcite and saumon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , with t@xmath17 = 1400 k , @xmath18 in figure 2 . in this model",
    "atmospheric condensate clouds are treated as described by @xcite with a sedimentation efficiency parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the model has been normalized to match the observed flux in the 8.6  9.0   region .",
    "models that include condensate sedimentation in the chemical equilibrium but ignore cloud opacity require unrealistically high t@xmath17 to acceptably fit the data and these are not shown here .",
    "we judge the excellent agreement of the cloudy model to the j0255@xmath04700 data as further evidence for finite - thickness silicate and iron clouds in the observable atmospheres of late l dwarfs .",
    "as can be seen in the figure the correlation between the model spectrum and the irs data is excellent , although there is a slight discrepancy between the data and model predictions in the h@xmath6o feature at 5.5  6.5 .",
    "in addition there is a broad shallow dip in the irs data compared with the model between 9 and 11  that may be due to a silicate cloud feature .",
    "the irs spectrum shows the first detection of the 7.8  ch@xmath7 band in a brown dwarf .",
    "@xmath12 was detected at 3.3   in l dwarfs by @xcite and since the @xmath20 band is of comparable strength to the @xmath21 fundamental , it is not surprising to find this mid - infrared signature of atmospheric methane in an l dwarf . models with ( @xcite ) and without ( @xcite ) dust opacity also anticipated this feature in the l dwarf t@xmath17 range along with the water features noted above .",
    "methane absorption is even more obvious in the spectrum of the @xmath1 indi b system discussed below .",
    "@xcite used oscir at gemini south to image j0255@xmath04700 in the @xmath22-band ( @xmath23  13.4 ) and three narrowband filters centered at 8.8 , 10.3 and 11.7 .",
    "flux density detections were obtained in the @xmath22 and 8.8  bands , with upper limits for the 10.3 and 11.7  bands . despite the estimated 25% uncertainty in our absolute flux calibration",
    ", the irs spectrum can not be scaled to match both their @xmath22-band and their 8.8  flux density measurements .",
    "@xcite note that the @xmath22-band flux density is a factor of 2 to 3 greater than the narrowband values and discuss possible causes of this discrepancy .",
    "our data can rule out two of their suggestions - the presence of peculiar emission or absorption lines .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show that there are no strong emission features in the @xmath22 bandpass and also that the narrow bandpasses do not fall in regions of strong absorption . while it is difficult to reconcile all of the creech - eakman et al .",
    "photometry with our irs spectrum , our data can be brought into approximate agreement with the three narrowband measurements if the spectrum is scaled to the lower limit of the 8.8 @xmath24 m oscir detection .",
    "this may indicate that the @xmath22-band measurement is in error .",
    "the @xmath1 indi ba and bb system consists of a t1 and t6 dwarf separated by 0732 @xcite .",
    "the irs does not have the spatial resolution to separate the two objects so the measured spectrum is a composite of the two individual spectra . in this object",
    "we find the first evidence for nh@xmath8 absorption in the spectrum between 10 and 11 , although its presence in very cool brown dwarf atmospheres has been expected for some time @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a weak detection of nh@xmath8 in the near infrared spectrum of the t6 dwarf gl 229b but this is the first strong detection of nh@xmath8 in a brown dwarf . with the lower t@xmath17 for the components of this binary system the condensate clouds",
    "are predicted to be below the photosphere and thus have a less pronounced effect on the composite spectrum than they do on the l8 dwarf s spectrum .",
    "a composite model spectrum provides an excellent match to the irs data and was obtained as follows . as with the model for j0255@xmath04700 we used the model described by @xcite and saumon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . from the estimates of @xmath25 for each component @xcite and the estimated age of @xmath1 indi a ( 0.82 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we use our brown dwarf cooling calculations @xcite to obtain ( @xmath11 , log  @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) = ( 1250 k , 5.13 , 0.094 ) , ( 840 k , 4.89 , 0.100 ) for the t1 and the t6 dwarfs , respectively . selecting the closest cloudless synthetic spectra in our grid of models ( 1200 k , 5.0 ) and ( 800 k , 5.0 ) which are within the uncertainties of those parameters , and using the above radii and the trigonometric parallax of @xmath1 indi a @xcite , the absolute flux at the earth of the t dwarf binary was obtained .",
    "note that in figure 2 , the composite model spectrum has not been normalized to the irs data , so that in this case the predicted flux agrees with the irs data to within the data errors .",
    "\\(1 ) we have taken advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity of the infrared spectrograph instrument on the spitzer space telescope to observe two brown dwarfs .",
    "these are the first spectra in this wavelength range ever reported for this type of object .",
    "the spectrum of an m dwarf is also reported here , providing a contrast between objects with masses above and below the hydrogen - burning minimum mass .",
    "\\(2 ) the observed mid - infrared spectral morphologies of these three objects vary strongly with their spectral classes , reflecting the changes in gas chemistry driven by the temperature of their atmospheres .",
    "\\(3 ) model comparisons with the observed spectra of all three objects show good agreement , with only a few minor deviations .",
    "models with cloud opacities do a better job of reproducing the data from j0255@xmath04700 than do models without clouds .",
