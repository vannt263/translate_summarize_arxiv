    "little higgs models are effective non - supersymmetric theories with a natural cutoff scale at about 10  tev , where the higgs scalar is a pseudo - goldstone boson of a global symmetry , which is spontaneously broken at a scale @xmath2  tev .",
    "the symmetry breaking pattern protects the higgs mass from quadratically divergent one - loop corrections , which are cancelled by new gauge bosons and fermions with masses near @xmath3 .",
    "therefore the hierarchy of scales can be realized without fine - tuning the parameters in the higgs potential .",
    "a simple implementation of this mechanism is given by the `` minimal moose '' model of ref .",
    "this model has two copies of the standard model ( sm ) gauge group , which are broken to the diagonal group at the scale @xmath3 , reminiscent of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "however , tree - level mixing between the gauge bosons introduces large corrections to the oblique electroweak parameters for @xmath2  tev , unless the gauge couplings of the two gauge sectors are almost equal  @xcite .",
    "this equality of couplings can be explained by a discrete symmetry called t - parity @xcite , under which the sm fields are t - even and the new tev - scale particles are odd . as a result ,",
    "all tree - level interactions between t - even and t - odd particles are forbidden , so that corrections to the electroweak precision observables occur only at one - loop level and thus are sufficiently small to allow values of @xmath3 of 1  tev and below .",
    "furthermore , the lightest t - odd particle is stable and , if neutral , can be a good dark matter candidate .",
    "often it is assumed that the new physics entering near the scale of 10  tev are some strong dynamics similar to technicolor theories . in this case , however , the fundamental theory can induce a wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) term @xcite , which is t - odd @xcite if t - parity is implemented as in ref .",
    "the breaking of t - parity by the wzw term , though suppressed by the large symmetry breaking scale , rules out the lightest t - odd particle as a dark matter candidate , since this particle would decay promptly into gauge bosons @xcite . on the other hand , it was recently shown that a different construction of the parity in moose models leads to a parity - even wzw term @xcite .",

    "is analyzed , and it is shown that successful electroweak symmetry breaking can be achieved . finally , section  [ sc : pheno ] discusses electroweak precision constraints and gives a brief overview of the collider phenomenology , before the conclusions are presented in section  [ sc : concl ] .",
    "the model is based on a large @xmath4^{4}}$ ] global symmetry group that is spontaneously broken to the diagonal vector group @xmath5 at a scale @xmath3 , giving rise to four sets of @xmath6 valued nonlinear sigma model fields @xmath7 under the global symmetry group they transform as @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the axial components of the global symmetries shift the goldstone fields , @xmath10 , thereby forbidding any nonderivative couplings for the goldstone fields .",
    "in particular , as long as these symmetries are not explicitly broken , a mass term ca nt be generated for the goldstone fields at any loop order .",
    "adding gauge and yukawa interactions will in general break some of the global symmetries and therefore generate @xmath11 mass terms for the corresponding goldstone bosons .",
    "the idea of collective symmetry breaking is to implement the required interactions in such a way that each interaction respects parts of the global symmetry and therefore keeps the corresponding goldstone bosons massless .",
    "only the simultaneous presence of different symmetry breaking interactions can then generate a mass for those goldstone bosons .",
    "since appropriate diagrams only appear at the two - loop level , the generated masses are suppressed by an additional loop factor and can be significantly below the scale @xmath3 .",

    "possibilities to introduce interactions that preserve enough global symmetries are discussed in @xcite .",

    "<S> the new parity prevents large corrections to oblique electroweak parameters and leads to a viable dark matter candidate . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown how the complete standard model particle content , including quarks and leptons together with their yukawa couplings , can be implemented . </S>",
    "<S> successful electroweak symmetry breaking and consistency with electroweak precision constraints is achieved for natural parameters choices . </S>",
    "<S> a rich spectrum of new particles is predicted at the tev scale , some of which have sizable production cross sections and striking decay signatures at the lhc .    </S>",
