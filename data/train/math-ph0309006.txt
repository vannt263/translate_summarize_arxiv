    "the loewner differential equation was introduced by karl lwner  @xcite ( who later changed his name to charles loewner ) to study properties of univalent functions on the unit disk .",
    "the differential equation is driven by a function that encodes in an ingeneous way continuous curves slitting the disk from the boundary .",
    "a few years ago , oded schramm realized that by taking brownian motion as the driving function , the loewner equation generates families of random curves with a conformally invariant measure , that he called `` stochastic loewner evolutions '' ( sle s )  @xcite .",
    "moreover , he showed that if the loop - erased random walk has a scaling limit , and if this scaling limit is conformally invariant , then it must be described by an sle , and he made similar conjectures about the scaling limits of uniform spanning trees and of critical percolation .",
    "the existence of conformally invariant scaling limits and the connections with sle were established for the first two models by lawler , schramm and werner  @xcite , and for critical site percolation on the triangular lattice by smirnov  @xcite . over the past few years schramm s idea has been investigated further , mainly in a combined effort of lawler , schramm and werner  @xcite , leading to new developments in the study of ( the scaling limit of ) discrete models .    in sle",
    "an ensemble of driving functions generates an ensemble of shapes .",
    "it is a difficult task to understand fully the relation between these two ensembles .",
    "for this reason we investigate here the simpler problem of the relation between a driving term in loewner s equation and the curve it generates , by explicit calculation .",
    "in particular we study exact , deterministic solutions of loewner s equation in the upper half  @xmath13 of the complex plane .",
    "one of the purposes of this study is to present some explicit examples that may help to elucidate the behavior of the curves generated by loewner s equation .",
    "for example , our solution for square - root forcing in section  [ squarerootforcing ] shows a transition from a simple curve that stays above the real line to a curve intersecting the real line , which is similar to the transition occurring at @xmath14 in sle .    to get us started , we need to understand how the loewner equation describes curves slitting the half - plane  @xmath13 .",
    "so suppose that @xmath15 , @xmath16 , is a simple curve in @xmath13 emanating from the real line .",
    "then according to conformal mapping theory , there exists a unique conformal mapping of the form @xmath17 that takes the domain  @xmath18 consisting of all points in  @xmath13 minus those on the slit  @xmath19 $ ] onto the upper half of the @xmath20-plane , in such a way that near infinity this map has the expansion @xmath21 see figure  [ slitmap ] for a schematic picture of the mapping .",
    "it is a theorem that the coefficient @xmath22 ( which is called the _ capacity _ ) is continuously increasing with  @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the parameterization of the curve can be chosen such that @xmath23 , and henceforth we assume that this is the case .     in the @xmath24-plane maps into a linear boundary in the @xmath20-plane .",
    "notice that two neighbouring points in the @xmath24-plane have images which are far apart in the @xmath20-plane . ]",
    "the conformal maps @xmath25 satisfy a surprisingly simple differential equation , which is the loewner equation    [ le ] @xmath26 with the initial condition @xmath27    for all @xmath24 in @xmath13 . here",
    ", the value of @xmath28 at time @xmath6 is just the image of the point @xmath15 under the map  @xmath25 .",
    "we call @xmath0 the driving function or forcing function of the loewner equation",
    ". it is continuous and real - valued .",
    "( for a text - book discussion of loewner s equation and proofs of the above statements when the domain is the unit disk , see @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the half - plane case we are considering here is analogous and is discussed in  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , the loewner equation  ( [ le ] ) has a solution for any given continuous real - valued function  @xmath0 .",
    "this generates the function  @xmath29 . for each value of @xmath6",
    "this function can be thought of as a mapping of the form @xmath17 which takes some connected subset of the upper - half @xmath24-plane , @xmath18 , into the entire region  @xmath13 above the real axis of the @xmath20-plane .",
    "correspondingly , there exists an inverse function  @xmath30 , which obeys @xmath31 for all  @xmath20 in the upper half - plane .",
    "this function maps the region  @xmath13 of the @xmath20-plane into the region  @xmath18 of the @xmath24-plane .",
    "it obeys the partial differential equation @xmath32    the loewner equation continually generates new singular points of  @xmath25 that are mapped by  @xmath25 onto the corresponding points  @xmath0 in the @xmath20-plane .",
    "thus , as time goes on , points are continually removed from  @xmath18 .",
    "if  @xmath0 is sufficiently smooth  @xcite , these singular points form a simple curve  @xmath33 , where the points  @xmath33 obey @xmath34 this curve is called the trace of the loewner evolution , but we also refer to it as the line of singularities .",
    "( naturally , if we take  @xmath0 to be the driving function corresponding to a given curve  @xmath15 as described above , then @xmath33 will coincide with  @xmath15 ) .",
    "equations  ( [ le ] ) have a simple scale invariance property under changing both the scale of space and of time .",
    "any change of time of the form @xmath35 can be compensated by a change of scale . to do this , define a new  @xmath36 and  @xmath28 by @xmath37 this pair then satisfies equations  ( [ le ] ) . note that by the schwarz reflection principle of complex analysis  @xcite , the map  @xmath25 extends to the lower half - plane and satisfies @xmath38 .",
    "it follows from equation  ( [ scale ] ) that flipping the sign of the forcing has the effect of reflecting the regions @xmath18 and  @xmath13 ( and hence also the line of singularities  @xmath33 ) in the imaginary axis .",
    "likewise , a shift in the driving function  @xmath0 can be compensated by a similar shift in  @xmath25 , since the pair @xmath39 again solves equations  ( [ le ] ) .",
    "this shows that a shift in the driving function simply produces a shift of the same magnitude in the trace  @xmath33 .",
    "in this note we are interested in the question how the behavior of the trace is related to that of the driving function .",
    "this question can be investigated both numerically and , in some cases , by exact methods . a simple numerical method to find the trace generated by a given driving function  @xmath0 , is to numerically integrate loewner s equation backwards from the initial condition @xmath40 to obtain the value of @xmath41 . to deal with the singularity in loewner s equation",
    ", we can use the first - order approximation @xmath42 substituting @xmath40 and solving this equation for @xmath43 gives an approximation for the value of  @xmath36 at time  @xmath44 , from where we then integrate backwards to obtain  @xmath45 .",
    "this method is good enough for the purpose of producing pictures .",
    "the figures [ linear ] , [ spirals ] , [ intersections ] and  [ doubletrace ] in this note were obtained in this way .",
    "exact solutions of equations  ( [ le ] ) can be found in a few cases .",
    "the simplest are ones in which the forcing has one of the forms    @xmath46    or @xmath47    for @xmath48 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . for a driving function of the form of equation  ( [ forceb ] )",
    ", a rescaling according to  ( [ scale ] ) gives the new forcing @xmath49 this result allows us to scale away the constant  @xmath50 when @xmath51 .",
    "for the special value @xmath52 the multiplicative constant can not be scaled away , and can be important in determining the form of the solution .    in sections",
    "[ constantforcing ] , [ linearforcing ] and  [ squarerootforcing ] we shall derive the solutions respectively for the powers @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and  @xmath2 . section  [ halfcircle ] contains an explicit construction of the maps  @xmath25 for a half - plane slit by an arc , and we point out that this is a special case of square - root forcing with a finite - time singularity . in section  [ varyingforcing ]",
    "we consider a more general version of loewner s equation , where the forcing is a superposition of the values  @xmath12 and produces two lines of singularities .",
    "here we look at the almost trivial situation in which @xmath48 and we can take @xmath53 this situation is well - known ( see for example  @xcite and appendix  a in  @xcite ) , but for the sake of completeness we also treat it here .",
    "we could of course shift  @xmath54 away by using equation  ( [ shift ] ) , but this case is so easy that shifting is hardly worth the effort . the equation for  @xmath36 can be solved by inspection , giving @xmath55^{1/2}.   \\label{gc}\\ ] ] the inverse map is of the same form as the direct one , namely @xmath56^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    at time  @xmath6 , the function  @xmath36 acquires a new singularity at the point @xmath57 which maps under  @xmath25 to the point  @xmath58 in the @xmath20-plane .",
    "thus the singularities form a line segment parallel to the imaginary axis and the mapped region of the @xmath24-plane is the upper half - plane minus that line segment .",
    "the mapping has a singular point at the place where the trace meets the real axis .",
    "we can approach this point @xmath59 from two different directions , giving us two different images at the points @xmath60 figure  [ constant ] gives an illustration of the mapping .        because any smooth enough function  @xmath0 looks locally",
    "as if it were constant , we might expect that smooth  @xmath0 s generate traces of singularities which look like simple curves coming up from the real axis .",
    "in fact , one can prove that this statement is correct whenever  @xmath0 is sufficiently smooth so that it is hlder continuous with exponent  @xmath2 and sufficiently small norm , i.e.  so that @xmath61 for all  @xmath6 and some constant  @xmath50 .",
    "the tricky issue is , when can it be that the curve will touch itself or hit the real line .",
    "condition  ( [ cond ] ) is enough to ensure that this will not happen , as was shown by marshall and rohde  @xcite , who did not give the value of the constant  @xmath50 .",

    "@xcite proves also generally that hlder-@xmath2 functions with coefficients @xmath63 generate slits .",
    "the next case , not much harder , has the forcing increase linearly with time according to @xmath64 we do not need an additive or multiplicative constant in equation  ( [ linear ] ) because these can be eliminated by equations ( [ scale ] ) and  ( [ shift ] ) .",

    "<S> in this note , we solve the loewner equation in the upper half - plane with forcing function  @xmath0 , for the cases in which @xmath0 has a power - law dependence on time with powers @xmath1 , @xmath2 and  @xmath3 . in the first case </S>",
    "<S> the trace of singularities is a line perpendicular to the real axis . in the second case </S>",
    "<S> the trace of singularities can do three things . if @xmath4 , the trace is a straight line set at an angle to the real axis . if @xmath5 , as pointed out by marshall and rohde  @xcite , the behavior of the trace as  @xmath6 approaches  @xmath3 depends on the coefficient  @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations give an explicit solution in which for @xmath8 the trace spirals into a point in the upper half - plane , while for @xmath9 it intersects the real axis . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that for @xmath10 the trace becomes a half - circle . the third case with forcing  @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> gives a trace that moves outward to infinity , but stays within fixed distance from the real axis . </S>",
    "<S> we also solve explicitly a more general version of the evolution equation , in which  @xmath0 is a superposition of the values  @xmath12 .    </S>",
