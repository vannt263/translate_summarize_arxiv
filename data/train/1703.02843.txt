    "dynamics of josephson vortices under strong dc and ac currents @xcite and applications in flux flow oscillators@xcite , multilayer thz radiation sources@xcite , or nanoscale superconducting structures for digital memory and quantum computing @xcite have been an area of active investigation , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "electrodynamics of josephson vortices has attracted much attention after the discoveries of high-@xmath0 cuprates and iron - based superconductors in which grain boundaries between misoriented crystallites behave as long josephson junctions which subdivide the materials into weakly coupled superconducting regions @xcite .",
    "the latter gives rise to the electromagnetic granularity which is one of the essential obstacles for applications of cuprate and iron - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "grain boundaries also become performance - limiting defects in superconducting resonator cavities @xcite and thin film multilayer screening structures @xcite for particle accelerators where the amplitudes of the radio - frequency meissner screening current densities @xmath1 can approach the depairing limit @xmath2 . in this case strongly - coupled grain boundaries in nb or nb@xmath3sn can behave as long josephson junctions , even though they may not manifest themselves as weak links in conventional dc magnetization or transport properties of superconductors at much smaller current densities required for depinning of vortices .",
    "a conventional theory of josephson ( j ) vortices is based on the generic sine - gordon equation @xcite which is applicable if the phase difference @xmath4 along the junction varies slowly over the magnetic penetration depth . for bulk long junctions",
    ", this condition requires small tunneling critical current densities @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the ginzburg - landau parameter @xcite .",
    "this condition does not allow using the sine - gordon approach for high-@xmath7 junctions ( such as low - angle grain boundaries ) in cuprates and pnictides with @xmath8 , and particularly for edge josephson junctions in thin films where a stray magnetic field @xmath9 outside the junction varies over the pearl length @xcite @xmath10 which can be much larger than the london penetration depth @xmath11 if the film thickness @xmath12 is much smaller than @xmath11 .",
    "for these cases the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath9 becomes nonlocal @xcite , resulting in mixed abrikosov - josephson ( aj ) vortices @xcite in which superconducting currents extending over the length @xmath13 circulate around a josephson core of length @xmath14 along the junction , where @xmath15 is larger than the coherence length @xmath16 . such aj vortices in which the order parameter in the core is not suppressed have been revealed by transport measurements on low - angle grain boundaries in cuprates @xcite , annular josephson junctions @xcite , magnetization of thin films @xcite , and most recently by stm imaging of step edge junctions in pb and in atomic monolayers on si substrates @xcite .",
    "dynamics of j vortices described by the sine - gordon equation has been investigated in great detail @xcite , but the effects of electromagnetic nonlocality on the properties of vortices in josephson junctions have been addressed to a much lesser extent .",
    "exact solutions which describe single and periodic aj vortices driven by strong ac currents in overdamped junctions have been obtained @xcite yet the nonlinear dynamics of fast vortices in the presence of weak ohmic drag is not well understood .",
    "however , it is the behavior of fast vortices in underdamped junctions which becomes markedly different from the conventional sine - gordon dynamics , because vortices moving with a constant velocity emit cherenkov radiation due to the fundamental nonlocality of josephson electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "recent simulations of vortices in long underdamped junctions have shown that the nonlocality can manifest itself in a striking instability of a moving vortex which generates a cascade of expanding vortex - antivortex ( v - av ) pairs above a threshold velocity even in nominally low-@xmath7 junctions in which weak nonlocality has been usually disregarded @xcite .",
    "this result addresses a broader issue of stability of topological defects driven by external forces and shows that a fast vortex can destroy the global phase coherence in a josephson junction in a way similar to crack propagation resulting from the pileup of dislocations of opposite polarity @xcite .",
    "our previous results @xcite obtained for an infinitely long junction bring about the following issues related to the dynamics of vortices in junctions of finite length which are most relevant to experiments : 1 .",
    "what happens to aj vortices driven by strong currents in a finite junction where in addition to the cherenkov radiation , a vortex also radiates as it accelerates and decelerates due to its attraction to the edges of the junction ?",
    "2 . how can the finite length of the junction affect generation of v - av pairs by the radiation field of moving vortices ? 3",
    ". how can the finite size effects change the structure of a static or moving aj vortex , and whether they could cause a transition from a vortex to a phase slip state in which @xmath17 becomes uniform along the junction ?",
    "4 . what are manifestations of josephson nonlocality in the dynamics of vortices in finite junctions , as compared to j vortices described by the sine - gordon equation @xcite ? addressing these issues is the goal of this work in which we investigate aj vortices driven by strong currents in thin film junctions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : elec ] we introduce the main integro - differential equations of nonlocal josephson electrodynamics ( nje ) which describe @xmath18 in junctions of different thin film geometries and specify the conditions under which the nonlocality becomes dominant .",
    "these equations were then solved both numerically and analytically in the extreme nonlocal limit . in section [ sec : overd ] we present an exact solution of nje equations for aj vortex driven by an arbitrary time - dependent transport current in overdamped junction of finite length . in section",
    "[ sec : dc ] we present numerical simulations of aj vortices driven by dc current at different damping constants",
    ". a dynamic transition from aj vortices to phase slip is shown to occur due to expansion of vortex core in overdamped junctions , and due to cherenkov radiation in underdamped junctions .",
    "it turns out that generation of vortex - antivortex pairs in finite junctions can occur at much larger damping constants than in infinite junctions . in section [ sec : ac ]",
