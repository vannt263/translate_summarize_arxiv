    "plasticity in crystalline solids is known to be carried by defects , typically dislocations , that glide irreversibly under the influence of loading the material with some mechanical load @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the study of plasticity and yield in amorphous solids is an ongoing subject of research , with many issues remaining to be discovered , especially in more complex amorphous glasses like polymeric glasses and metallic glasses .",
    "much of the recent progress in understanding plasticity in amorphous solids was based on experiments and simulations done by loading the system under strain control protocols .",
    "a useful simulational protocol that attracted much attention is the quasi - static athermal ( aqs ) strain control protocol , in which the system is maintained at zero temperature , and is allowed to return to mechanical equilibrium after every small increase in strain @xcite .",
    "this protocol exposed very nicely the role of mechanical instabilities .",
    "these are easily detected by examining the hessian matrix of the system ; the eigenvalues of this matrix are all positive when the system is mechanically stable , while a plastic instability is characterized by an eigenvalue approaching zero , typically via a saddle - node bifurcation @xcite .",
    "when this happens , the associated eigenfunction , which is also identified with the non - affine response of the system , localizes on a sub - set of particles , those that participate in the plastic event .    in this paper",
    "we examine the corresponding physics for stress controlled protocols . in some sense , this is the more natural protocol because it provides one with the right control to precisely determine when does the system yield in the sense that its strain will increase indefinitely as long as the stress is maintained at a given value .",
    "when the stress is below the yield stress @xmath1 the strain will reach a limit .",
    "indeed , some attempts to study yield using stress controlled simulations were reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "we propose a more straightforward protocol that appears to provide highly stable results which are in good correspondence with the best available strain - controlled results .",
    "the new protocol is introduced in sect .",
    "[ protocol ] . in sect .",
    "[ model ] we present the physical models employed here .",
    "we discuss stress - controlled loading of a perfect hexagonal structure in 2-dimensions , the same structure marred by some defects , and finally a generic binary glass .",
    "this section includes some of the main conclusions of this study : we argue that the instabilities seen in stress control loading are the very same saddle - node bifurcations that are exhibited in strain - controlled experiments .",
    "the difference is that once the system yields in stress - control there is no recovery . in strain",
    "controlled loading the system can yield , release a portion of its stress , and then be loaded again , to yield again etc . therefore one sees the typical serrated stress vs. strain curves that can go for some time up to high values of the strain .",
    "in contrast , in stress controlled experiments the system either gets stuck if the applied stress is smaller than the yield stress , or it fails if the stress is higher than the yield stress .",
    "we show that the knowledge of strain controlled results is useful in predicting much of what can happen in stress controlled loading . in sect .",
    "[ temp ] we focus on thermal effects , and particularly what happens when the stress is lower than the yield stress but temperature fluctuations can result in surmounting the barrier and failing .",
    "predicting the waiting time becomes an easy exercise once one realizes that the transition is due to a saddle node bifurcation .",
    "this fact implies that the eigenvalue that vanishes at the transition has a square - root singularity , and together with the generic dependence of the barrier hight on the distance from the bifurcation one can easily estimate the waiting time .",
    "[ summary ] offers a summary and some concluding remarks .",

    "when the applied shear stress @xmath89 exceeds @xmath1 the solid fails and the shear strain grows without limit .",
    "this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "it is noteworthy that the definition and the existence of @xmath1 do * not * depend on this step - wise increase in external shear stress .",
    "one could go in one step to any value of the external shear stress and the response of the system will be the same , failing only when @xmath93 .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the monte carlo results are compared with an aqs stress controlled protocol ( see in subsect .",
    "[ zerot ] how this is defined and computed ) .",
    "one is not surprised that at zero temperature the yield stress is considerably higher , and see below for more details .",
    "at this point it is enough to stress that @xmath1 depends on temperature if one can wait . only at zero temperature",
    "this quantity is absolute in the sense that no waiting time is necessary for the system to fail .",
    "we return to this important issue in sect . [ temp ] where we estimate the waiting time .    at finite temperature the internal stress , the energy and the strain fluctuate . the extent of these fluctuations at @xmath60 is shown in fig .  [ fig6 ] . below the yield stress",
    "the system exhibits elastic behavior . when the yield stress is exceeded the system stays for a while in a series of metastable states ( each of which exhibiting  elastic \" behavior ) whose life time becomes shorter and shorter until the simulation box collapses entirely .",
    "note that these metastable states are the elastic branches that are seen very clearly in strain - controlled experiments , cf .",
    "[ fig11 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] . in that protocol",
    "the system loses energy and releases strain upon reaching a saddle point bifurcation and lands on the next elastic branch where it will stay forever if the strain does not increase .",
    "this is different from what is seen here , where once @xmath1 is exceeded the system fails , even though it may reside for a while on metastable states .      in this subsection",
    "we show how to use the results of aqs strain control simulations to predict the physics of aqs stress control loading .",
    "consider therefore the stress - strain relation using the athermal limit in the nvt ensemble defined by eq .",
    "( [ entgt ] ) .",
    "imagine then that we run an aqs strain control simulation , and for every value of @xmath51 we record the energy @xmath94 of the force free configuration after the non - affine relaxation took place . in order to find the minimum of the function ( [ entgt ] ) with regard to particle positions and the strain at a given external stress we have to study the dependence on strain of the generalized enthalpy .",
    "this dependence is shown in fig .",
    "we reiterate that the contribution @xmath94 is independent of stress and is defined by minimizing the energy at given strain via a relaxation of the particle positions .",
    "0.5 cm    in the unstressed perfectly hexagonal structure there is only one minimum which is associated with a single reference state . under applied stress",
    "there appears the metastable state separated from the global minimum by a barrier .",
    "the barrier height decreases with increasing stress and it disappears at the ( zero - temperature ) yield stress .",
    "we can now estimate the stress - strain relation from the series of curves that are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . as the stress increases the minimum of the curve shifts to higher values of strain .",
    "the stress vs strain dependence that is read in this way is shown in fig .",
    "we see the almost perfect correspondence between the two curves for small values of stress .",
    "the discrepancy at higher strains results from having different ensembles : in the aqs protocol the pressure varies non - monotonically with strain , in contrast to the monte carlo protocol at constant pressure , which in the present case is @xmath61 .",
    "the increase in pressure in this aqs stress - controlled procedure eliminates the failure of the material that we observe in the monte carlo stress - controlled protocol .",
    "nevertheless we can predict the failure in the latter protocol from the former . we need to focus on that value of the stress where for the first time the depth of the two minima in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] is the same .",
    "note that this occurs at @xmath95 in excellent agreement with the results shown in fig .",
    "similar predictability will be shown below for the more complex examples",
    ".    0.5 cm      our second system of interest is the hexagonal structure with a small number of defects whose concentration is about 2% , as seen in the lower panel of fig . [ fig2 ] .",
    "trajectories of measured values of the energy and the strain @xmath51 as a function of the mc sweeps ( here we used 2@xmath96 sweeps ) are shown in fig .",
    "in contrast to the perfect hexagonal structure the strain @xmath51 displays at @xmath60 behavior typical to a bimodal distribution .",
    "nevertheless , the comparison with results for higher temperature @xmath97 which exhibit the liquid behavior ( see also @xcite ) shows that the system at lower temperature is in a solid state .",
    "a few examples of the same dependence under applied external stress are shown in fig .",
    "one can see that at relatively small values of external stress there are allowed transitions between available configurations .",
    "then the applied stress exceeds some critical value @xmath98 this dependence indicates the permanent deformation of the simulation cell via a number of metastable states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .    the aqs strain controlled protocol ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig11 ] ) ) now reveals that @xmath94 has a more complex landscape with a number of local minima .",
    "the athermal analysis of the generalized enthalpy can be done again as explained above .",
    "the applied external stress shifts equilibrium positions similarly to the mc results . unfortunately , in the present case the amount of change in the pressure in the aqs protocol is too large to afford to say quantitative statement , leaving us with only a qualitative comparison .    nevertheless , the simulation results show that transitions between different minima can soften the material enormously , leading to a yield stress that is enormously smaller than the corresponding one for the perfect hexagonal structure .      in the glass simulations we employed 400 particles in the simulation cell . a typical configuration of the binary mixture which produces our model glass is shown in fig .  [ fig13 ]",
    "the reader can already guess that the increased disorder seen in this figure will translate to an increased complexity in the enthalpy landscape .",
    "indeed , in fig . [ fig15 ]",
    "we show the enthalpy landscape as computed using the strain - controlled protocol and the changing landscapes upon the increase of the external stress .",
    "the corresponding results of the monte carlo simulation of the stress - strain dependence under stress control ( in the glass simulations we use 2@xmath96 sweeps ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] .    to understand these results we again turn to the strain control experiment at @xmath0 , for which we exhibit the stress vs strain trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] .",
    "note again the immense difference between the two protocols : in strain controlled simulations one sees many plastic instabilities , and in each of them the system releases a part of the stress and a part of its mechanical energy .",
    "the strain is no longer a state variable due to the irreversible drops in energy .",
    "in contrast , in the stress control experiment one is bound to get stuck at one of the elastic branches as long as the stress is lower than the yield stress @xmath1 , which in the present case is about 0.26 . at zero temperature",
    "the stress control experiment can exhibit only one instability where the system fails , when @xmath99 . at finite temperatures one can observe multiple instabilities also in the stress control protocol as the system overcomes the barriers with the help of temperature fluctuations .",
    "of course for a given external stress the waiting time will get longer and longer as the barrier increases , until the barrier that is associate with the zero - temperature @xmath1 is reached .",
    "finally note also the precise correspondence between the zero - temperature and the finite temperature trajectories for small values of stress in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] .",
    "this correspondence can be maintained for much higher values of stress and strain by reducing the temperature .",
    "an important point to discuss is the fact that the glass is much more cohesive than structure * ii * even though is has many more  defects \" .",
    "the reason for this lies in the microscopic interactions that are exhibited in fig .",
    "we see there that the ab interaction is considerably deeper than the aa interaction , meaning that the b particles act as pinning centers for the movement of a particles .",
    "this is in fact the deep reason why this mixture is a good glass former . for the structure * ii",
    "* there is nothing that can pin the defects and they glide happily under any minute strain or stress , which explains the low yield stress of that structure compared to the glass .",
    "indeed , this insight should be remembered whenever one wants to increase the cohesiveness of glasses , or to increase their shear modulus or their yield stress .",
    "one should add particles that act effectively as pinning centers , and see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "at this point we focus on values of the stress that are close to the yields stress @xmath1 , and particularly to the zero temperature value of this quantity ( much of the discussion in this section is however relevant for any instability point at lower values of stress ) . stressing the system at zero temperature will result in the system being stuck at a mean strain value @xmath100 that is less than the value of the strain which is associated with the position of the highest barrier , denoted conveniently as @xmath101 .",
    "the question that we pose in this section is what is the waiting time @xmath102 ( first passage time ) for failure if the temperature is not zero .",
    "the problem is the classical one for escape over a barrier , but because this is a saddle node bifurcation there are some special characteristics that need to be taken into account .",
    "the general expectation for the waiting time is that it should scale like @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the typical frequency of oscillations in the metastable minimum from which the system escapes , and as before @xmath105 is the enthalpic barrier that becomes a saddle together with the minimum at @xmath106 .",
    "one knows that in a saddle node bifurcation the frequency @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the lowest eigenvalue of the hessian matrix .",
    "the latter goes to zero at the saddle bifurcation like @xmath109 . as long as the harmonic approximation is relevant",
    "we can therefore write @xmath110 on the other hand the height of the barrier scales like @xmath111 using these scaling estimates in eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) we see that formally the waiting time diverges both at @xmath112 and at @xmath113 with a minimum waiting time at a temperature dependent value @xmath114 . in reality",
    "however for any finite temperature we lose the relevance of the harmonic approximation in the limit @xmath112 , and we need to use the next , nonsingular , anharmonic correction to @xmath104 . also in the other limit , when @xmath115 becomes large , we lose the relevance of the scaling law ( [ delg ] ) , destroying the singularity in this limit .",
    "thus in both limits we predict a nonsingular waiting time .",
    "the conclusion is that a precise estimate of the waiting time calls for molecular dynamics simulations that are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the main aim of this paper was to introduce a reliable simulational approach to stress controlled loading of systems at zero or finite temperatures .",
    "the method of variable shape appears stable and useful , and we exemplified it for a perfect hexagonal structure , the same structure with a few defects , and a generic binary glass in 2-dimensions .",
    "the main conclusion is that the type of mechanical instabilities encountered in stress - controlled protocols is one and the same as those seen in strain - controlled protocols , i.e saddle node bifurcations in which the hessian matrix becomes unstable , sending one of its eigenvalues to zero . as a result , the knowledge of the possible instabilities that are found in aqs strain - controlled simulations is very helpful forr understanding what is happening in stress - controlled simulations , even at finite temperature .",
    "of course , the difference in the type of ensemble is not unimportant , and deviations in the system response from one protocol to the other are expected and also found . nevertheless approximating the enthalpy landscape with the help of the aqs stain controlled simulations",
    "is shown to be very useful in clarifying what one should expect in a finite temperature stress - controlled protocol .",
    "examples of this understanding were given for all the three examples treated in this paper .",
    "finally we examined the issue of the waiting time for yield in stress - controlled simulations , making full use of the identification of the instabilities as saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "the conclusion there was that one can see a decrease or increase in the waiting time as a function of the distance from the instability , but that eventually the waiting time is not singular .",
    "we reiterate that all our stress - controlled simulations here were performed for zero pressure .",
    "it would be interesting in the future to follow up on the present study with stress - controlled simulations when different component of the stress tensor are kept constant , to see how the response of the system depends on such details .",
    "we hope to report on such simulations in forthcoming publications .",
    "in addition , and maybe even more importantly , the present protocol allows a very precise study of the yielding process itself .",
