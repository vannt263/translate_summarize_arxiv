    "the modular matrices can be extracted from the knowledge of entanglement in the ground state of a topological phase and the full characterization of the to is therefore possible @xcite .",
    "topological color code @xcite is an example of topologically ordered system , which its ground state describes a spin liquid phase with @xmath0 topological order .",
    "due to its special structure on the trivalent lattices and an interplay between color and homology in the construction of the code , the number of encoded logical qubits in the color code is twice the number of kitaev s toric code @xcite .",
    "this allows the full implementation of the whole clifford group in a fully topological manner in the ground state space and make the fault tolerant quantum computation possible , without resorting to the braiding of qps .",
    "it is possible to show that the color code is equivalent to two copies of the toric code and therefore the two models belong to the same family of the universal topological phases @xcite .",
    "recently , a minimal version of the color codes , namely the triangular codes , has been realized experimentally which is a step forward in building a quantum memory based on the topological color codes @xcite .",

    "we further investigate the ground state dependence of the tee by calculating the renyi entropy on regions with non - contractible boundaries , i.e. by cutting the torus to half cylinders , and identify the multiple independent minimum entropy states @xcite of the tcc , which form a set of orthogonal basis states for the ground state manifold .",

    "although , robustness of the tcc in the presence of a single parallel magnetic field has already been examined by one of the authors through analyzing the energy spectrum of the system with high - order series expansion technique @xcite , we believe that observing the topologically ordered ground state , while the perturbation is tuned , will provide a more comprehensive picture about the robustness and its corresponding quantum phase transition .",
