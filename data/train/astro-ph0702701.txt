    "a large population of obscured powerful quasars called type-2 quasars has long been predicted by the widely accepted unified model for active galactic nuclei . they have been predicted to be the same as type-1 quasars but with strong obscuration in both optical and soft x - ray band , due to the presumable torus .",
    "most of such type-2 quasars , which might dominate the black hole growth have been missed by optical surveys for quasars .",
    "although doubt has been expressed at times on the existence of type-2 quasars , mainly due to their rareness and the fact that they are easily mimicked by other types of agns , hard x - ray surveys have revealed a large number of such sources .",
    "this is mainly because hard x - ray emission is less biased by the obscuration ( but note for compton - thick absorption , even hard x - ray emission is strongly attenuated ) .",
    "another advantage of x - day data is that x - ray spectral fitting can yield intrinsic luminosity and absorption simultaneously , which are both required to study the population of obscured quasars .",
    "meanwhile infrared surveys also made significant progress on discovering such sources ( e.g. , martnez - sansigre et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "various studies have shown that the fraction of obscured agn decreases with increasing luminosity , suggesting that different from seyfert galaxies , most quasars are unobscured ( e.g. ueda et al .",
    "2003,steffen et al . 2003",
    "; barger et al . 2005 ) .",
    "for instance , ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) computed the x - ray luminosity function for 2  10 kev selected agn samples , and found that the fraction of x - ray absorbed agns ( with @xmath1 @xmath2 10@xmath3 @xmath4 ) drops from @xmath0 0.6 at intrinsic @xmath5 around 10@xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 to around 0.3 at @xmath5 above 10@xmath8 ergs s@xmath7 .",
    "however , contrary results are also reported suggesting most quasars are obscured ones ( see eckart et al .",
    "2006 , dwelly et al .",
    "2005 , dwelly & page 2006 , martnez - sansigre et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "for example , eckart et al . ( 2006 ) found that half of the agns identified by the sexsi program are x - ray obscured with @xmath1 @xmath2 10@xmath3 @xmath4 , and the fraction of obscured agns is independent of the unobscured luminosity .",
    "soft gamma - ray selected agn samples ( markwardt et al . 2005 ; bassani et al .",
    "2006 ) obtained by @xmath9 and @xmath10 provide the best opportunity to study the fraction of obscured agn in the local universe in the least biased way .",
    "they have claimed based on these samples , that the fraction of obscured agns in the local universe significantly decrease with increasing luminosity , and most luminous agns are unobscured .     versus soft gamma - ray luminosity in the 20  100 kev band for @xmath9 and integral selected agns . see wang & jiang 2006 for details . ]    however , we point out that two correction have to be made to the samples to study of the fraction of obscured quasars .",
    "the corrections are : a ) radio loud agns have to be excluded since their x - ray emission might be dominated by the jet component thus the measured luminosity and the obscuration does not reflect the intrinsic values in the nuclei ; b ) compton thick sources have to be excluded too since their soft gamma ray emission are also strongly attenuated by compton scattering and their intrinsic luminosities are hard to estimate .    in fig .",
    "1 we plot the x - ray absorption column density @xmath1 versus soft gamma - ray luminosity for a combined sample of agn selected by @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we can clearly the clear anti - correlation between the x - ray absorption and luminosity is mainly due to the contribution of radio loud sources and compton - thick sources , excluding which would reduce the significance level of the anti - correlation from @xmath2 99.99% to 94% .",
    "this indicate that the decrease in the fraction of obscured agns with luminosity in the local universe is not solid .",
    "larger samples are required to reach a more robust conclusion .     versus absorption - corrected luminosity for 4  7",
    "kev band selected sources in cdf - s .",
    "it s clear that most of the quasars ( with l@xmath11 @xmath2 10@xmath8 erg / s ) are obscured in x - ray with n@xmath12 @xmath2 10@xmath3 @xmath4 . ]",
    "the 2 ms @xmath13 exposure on @xmath13 deep field north ( cdf - n , alexander et al . 2003 ) and 1 ms exposure on @xmath13 deep field south ( cdf - s , giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ) are the deepest x - ray images ever taken . with a redshift completeness of 99% ,",
    "the x - ray sources detected in @xmath13 deep field south ( cdf - s ) provide the best sample for the study of the population of obscured quasars .    in a dedicated paper ( wang et al .",
    "2007 ) , we study the population of obscured quasars in cdf - s by choosing the 4  7 kev selected sample . we show that 4  7 kev selected sample is even less biased by the intrinsic x - ray absorption comparing to the normal hard hard ( 2  7 kev ) .",
    "the samples also filter out most of the x - ray faint sources with too few counts , for which the measurements of n@xmath12 and l@xmath14 have very large uncertainties . simply adopting the best - fit l@xmath11 and n@xmath12",
    ", we find 71@xmath1519% ( 20 out of 28 ) of the quasars ( with intrinsic l@xmath11 @xmath2 10@xmath8 erg s@xmath7 ) are obscured with n@xmath12",
    "@xmath2 10@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "taking account of the uncertainties in the measurements of both n@xmath12 and l@xmath14 , conservative lower and upper limits of the fraction are 54% ( 13 out 24 ) and 84% ( 31 out 37 ) . in @xmath13 deep field north , the number is 29% , however , this is mainly due tothe redshift incompleteness .",
    "we estimate a fraction of @xmath0 50% - 63% after correcting the redshift incompleteness with a straightforward approach .",
    "our results robustly confirm the existence of a large population of obscured quasars at redshift of 1 @xmath0 4 .",
    "to study the fraction of obscured agns as a function of luminosity is a difficult issue .",
    "it requires large and redshift complete samples .",
    "studies have tried to combine deep surveys with wide area surveys to cover a large range of luminosity and redshift .",
    "however note most deep surveys suffer redshift incompleteness in their samples , thus could bring obvious biases . using cdf - s where we have a redshift completeness of 99% , we find most quasars selected at @xmath16 = 1 @xmath0 4 are obscured .",
    "we also show that in the local universe the previous claimed decrease in the fraction of obscured agn with luminosity is mainly due the radio loud sources and compton thick sources in the samples , for which the observed luminosities are not intrinsic . excluding these sources would erase the decrease statistically and support a constant fraction of obscured agns with luminosity .",
    "this indicates that most quasars at low redshift could possibly also be obscured .",
