    "cutting around this peak by requiring @xmath11  @xmath12 , we select a diffractive sample of @xmath4 events , in which a clear enhancement appears in the mass spectrum near 1750  @xmath1(fig .",

    "plotting the @xmath10 spectra in the 1750 region ( 16401860  @xmath1 ) and in the two sideband regions ( 15001600  @xmath1and 19002100  @xmath1 ) , it is seen that the 1750 region has a peak in the @xmath10 spectrum in nearly the same place as the @xmath13 peak , but the sideband regions have significantly smaller @xmath10 peaks , indicating that the background under the x(1750 ) signal is largely non - diffractive .     sample with no cut on @xmath10.,width=226,height=151 ]    fitting the 1750  @xmath1mass region with a non - relativistic breit - wigner distribution and a quadratic background , we find @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16     mass spectrum with the requirement that @xmath17  @xmath12 .",

    "in fact , because the mass of the x(1750 ) is significantly higher than all known vector mesons , the most massive of which are the @xmath27 , @xmath26 , and @xmath28 , an interpretation claiming the x(1750 ) is some combination of interfering vector mesons also seems highly unlikely .",
