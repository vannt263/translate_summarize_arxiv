    "individual chain polymers in good solvents are typically modelled by trajectories of random walks , or  - in the continuum limit - by brownian paths .",
    "such models by themselves however do not take into account that self - crossings of these paths should be suppressed , this `` the excluded volume '' effect will make the trajectories less curly and more extended .",
    "fractional brownian paths have been suggested as a heuristic model for such swelling , or on the other hand for polymers in a collapsed state @xcite , but a more proper model would be based on self - avoiding random walks , or on  a weight factor which penalizes self - crossings , such as in the continuum edwards @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite west3 @xcite or the discrete domb - joyce @xcite model .",
    "the ensuing swelling of the molecular conformations is given by the flory index @xcite @xcite which describes the scaling of the end - to - end distance as a function the number of monomers .",
    "it has been extensively studied both in the ( chemical ) physics and the mathematics community .",
    "the physics literature is characterized by structural intuition and far - reaching predictions , the mathematical results are less far - reaching but provide the high reliability characteristic of the mathematical approach .",
    "both are too vast to be quoted here , we refer for this to recent reviews @xcite @xcite .    in the present paper , after a few words on fractional brownian motion fbm , we shall see that one can extend to fbm the edwards model of brownian paths with exponentially suppressed self - intersections , @xmath0a mathematical existence proof has been established recently @xcite . in the third part of the paper",
    "we generalize some by now classical arguments from the physics literature to explore what the flory index might be in the fbm case .",

    "there is the famous flory formula @xmath24based originally on a mean field argument . since its proposal by flory fisher @xcite ,",
    "numerous methods were invoked to put it on a more solid mathematical basis , a process which has up to now been fully successful in the case @xmath25 @xcite .    to obtain what may be considered as a first guess of a similar formula for fbm we shall return to the modest beginnings , generalizing fisher s original argument @xcite @xcite ( see e.g.  the review given in mckenzie @xcite ) to the case at hand .      a partition function @xmath26 for a freely jointed chain of @xmath19 segments for which the end - to - end length has fixed modulus @xmath20",

    ", any flory formula should be considered only up to the critical dimension , i.e. as long as there are double points and an excluded volume effect .",
    "similarly , any prediction of @xmath55 would be unphysical : the end - to - end distance can not grow faster than the number n of monomers . in the case at hand",
