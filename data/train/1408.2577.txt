    "understanding diffusive motions is a long - standing problem in the physicists agenda . since the works of einstein , smoluchowski and langevin , we know that one of the most striking patterns of classical ( usual ) free diffusion is the linear growth with time of the second moment of the particle positions . while this feature is ubiquitous in nature ,",
    "many other patterns have been also observed for the second moment , both from analytical calculations and experimental data  @xcite .",
    "these deviants behaviors are often called anomalous diffusion .    nowadays , efforts have been mainly focused on understanding the underlying physical mechanisms that lead to such deviations , since only the classification of the diffusive behaviors of a given system is not enough to fully characterize it . in this context ,",
    "two common pathways for anomalous diffusion are long - range correlations in the particle positions and geometric constraints related with the structural complexity of the environment where the particles are moving .",
    "the former may be related to memory affects and an example is the fractional brownian motion  @xcite , where the second moment has a power - law dependence with time , that is , @xmath4 . for this case",
    ", the hurst exponent @xmath5 classifies the anomalous diffusion in subdiffusion ( @xmath6 ) or superdiffusion ( @xmath7 )  @xcite and also recovers usual ( @xmath8 ) and ballistic ( @xmath9 ) diffusions as limiting cases .",
    "anomalous diffusion due to geometric constraints is well exemplified by the comb model . in this model ,",
    "diffusive particles walk on a two - dimensional space ; however , motions in the @xmath0-direction are only allowed when the @xmath1 coordinate of the particle positions is zero .",
    "the result of this simple constraint is a subdiffusive motion ( precisely , @xmath10 with @xmath11 ) and the appearance of a backbone ( at @xmath12 ) and teeth ( along the @xmath2axis direction ) , which were originally proposed to mimic the quasilinear structure and dangling ends of percolation clusters  @xcite .    mainly due to its simplicity and ability of mimicking diffusive aspects of highly disordered systems , the comb model has been extensively studied and extended by means of analytical calculations  @xcite and also employed as simplified description of natural phenomena such as cancer proliferation  @xcite , transport of spiny dendrites  @xcite and diffusion of ultra cold atoms  @xcite .",
    "moreover , as crowded environments tend to slow down the diffusive motion of particles by obstruction and/or trapping  @xcite , the comb model could also be used as a toy model for describing diffusion in intracellular processes , where several researchers have reported the existence of subdiffusion and ergodicity breaking in the random walk of different biochemical compounds  @xcite by using single particle tracking  @xcite . in the case of intracellular processes , the power - law exponents @xmath13 describing the second moment ranges from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ( evaluated both from ensemble and time average ) and , in the case of ultra cold atoms , @xmath13 appears as a function of lattice depth and assumes values larger than one ( @xmath16 , superdiffusion ) .",
    "in addition to the anomalous scaling of the second moment , the work of weiss  @xcite has also shown that the diffusive processes of intracellular fluids may present long - range corrections as in the fractional brownian motion , an empirical finding that have not been explored within the comb model framework . also , recently ,",
    "yamamoto _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have provided evidence ( from molecular dynamics simulation ) that the anomalous diffusion of water molecules on cell membrane surface arises from both divergent mean trapping time and long - range correlated noises . here",
    ", we extend the comb model by considering a langevin - like equation where the noises are long - range correlated .",
    "our model thus combines two of the main mechanisms of anomalous diffusion : geometric constraints and long - range correlations , allowing a more complete description of complex diffusive motions and also the study of the interplay between these two mechanisms . by carrying out computer simulations ,",
    "we show that the correlations in the @xmath2direction affect the diffusive behavior in the @xmath3direction in a non - trivial fashion and that a quite rich diffusive scenario emerges from these long - range correlations .",
    "we report that diffusive process in the @xmath3direction of this generalized version of the comb model can be usual , superdiffusive or subdiffusive , depending on both corrections in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions .",
    "we further show that the long - range correlations affect the probability distribution of the particle positions in the @xmath3direction : the distribution becomes more leptokurtic when the noise in the @xmath2direction is persistent whereas , for anti - persistent noise , it becomes less leptokurtic and approaches the gaussian distribution as a limiting case .",
    "we start by writing the generalized diffusion equation describing the motion under the comb structure  @xcite : @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the joint probability of the particle positions ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 coordinates ) as a function of time @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the diffusive coefficients in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions . note the presence of the dirac delta @xmath22 multiplying the spatial derivative with respect to @xmath0 and , consequently , limiting the diffusion in the @xmath3direction only for @xmath12 . in order to investigate the role of long - range correlations in this diffusive process",
    ", we propose to numerically solve the following coupled langevin - like equations @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants related to @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are fractional gaussian noises  @xcite , both with zero mean ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , unitary variances ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) and correlations functions ( for @xmath32 ) given by @xmath33 notice that the noises @xmath26 and @xmath27 are power - law correlated with scaling exponents @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the so - called hurst exponents . for @xmath38 , the correlation functions have negative signs and the noises are anti - persistent , meaning that positive values are followed by negative values ( or vice - versa ) more frequently than by chance ; while for @xmath39 the correlations are positive , meaning that positive values are followed by positive values and negative values are followed by negative values more frequently than by chance .",
    "fully persistent noises occur as a limiting case when @xmath40 , whereas normal brownian ( white ) noises correspond to the limit of @xmath41 .",
    "when running out the simulations of the langevin equations , we have considered a narrow band of thickness @xmath42 along the @xmath3axis , inside which the diffusion in the @xmath3direction occurs .",
    "this strip mimics the effect of the dirac delta @xmath22 ( that appears multiplying the noise @xmath26 in eq .  [ leqcomb ] ) and we have verified that the value @xmath42 has no influence in the diffusive process , as long as @xmath42 and noises amplitudes @xmath24 and @xmath25 are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this restriction ensures that the variable @xmath1 presents no dynamics inside the strip . for our proposes , we have fixed @xmath43 .",
    "the fractional gaussian noises @xmath26 and @xmath27 were generated by following the hosking method  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows examples of simulated trajectories for three different values of @xmath37 and keeping @xmath44 . by visual inspection , we note that depending on whether the motion in @xmath1 is anti - persistent [ fig  [ fig1](a ) ] or persistent [ fig  [ fig1](c ) ] , the diffusive behavior in the @xmath3direction drastically changes .",
    "the anti - persistence in @xmath45 causes the particle to return more often to the strip where the diffusive motion in the @xmath3direction is allowed ; consequently , @xmath46 covers a larger interval along the @xmath3axis when compared with the usual comb [ @xmath47 , fig  [ fig1](b ) ] . on the other hand , persistence in @xmath45 causes the particle to return less often to the strip and , consequently , @xmath46 covers a small interval along the @xmath3axis .     with @xmath43 .",
    "we have kept @xmath44 and considered three values of the hurst exponent @xmath37 : ( a ) @xmath48 , ( b ) @xmath49 and ( c ) @xmath50 .",
    "note that the walker returns less often to @xmath51 when the noise is persistent in the @xmath1-direction ( @xmath52 ) ; whereas , for an anti - persistent noise ( @xmath53 ) , the walker returns more often to @xmath54 when compared with the usual comb ( @xmath47 ) . ]    before quantifing the effects of the long - range correlations on the variances of @xmath46 and @xmath45 , we have first verified whether the langevin equations [ eq .",
    "( [ leqcomb ] ) ] are actually equivalent to the generalized diffusion equation [ eq .  ( [ eqcombusual ] ) ]",
    "when the noises @xmath26 and @xmath27 are uncorrelated ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we thus simulate an ensemble of @xmath55 particle positions considering @xmath56 and @xmath47 . by using these data ,",
    "we evaluate the temporal evolution of the variances @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes ensemble average .",
    "figures  [ fig2](a ) and ( b ) show the behavior of @xmath59 and @xmath60 versus time for several values of the maximum integration time @xmath61 in the langevin equations , ranging from @xmath62 to @xmath63 as indicated in these plots . in both cases , we note a finite - size - like effect characterized by a crossover time @xmath64 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 change their behaviors . despite that and also discarding an initial transient regime ( @xmath65 ) , we observe that the variance profiles of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are in well agreement with the power laws predicted by the generalized diffusion equation of the usual comb [ eq .",
    "( [ eqcombusual ] ) ] , that is , @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "we have also analyzed the behavior of the crossover time @xmath64 in function of the maximum integration time @xmath61 .",
    "figures  [ fig2](c ) and ( d ) show that @xmath64 grows linearly with @xmath61 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , confirming that the simulated power - law regimes prevail when @xmath61 tends to infinity .     in the @xmath3direction and ( b ) @xmath70 in the @xmath2direction for several values of the maximum integration time @xmath61 ( as indicated in the plots ) .",
    "the dashed lines represent the predictions of the generalized diffusion equation , that is , @xmath71 with @xmath68 and @xmath72 with @xmath69  @xcite .",

    "figures  [ fig3](a ) and  [ fig3](b ) show these distributions for several values of @xmath19 where we note the spreading of these distributions . for a better comparison with the analytical predictions of eq .",

[ fig3 ] corroborate with the equivalence between our simulations of the langevin equations and the diffusion equation for the comb model .     and",

    "we note the spreading of these distributions and the normality of @xmath83 .",
    "marginal distributions of normalized positions ( c ) @xmath84 and ( d ) @xmath78 for the same values of @xmath19 of the previous figures .",
    "the gray lines are the marginal distributions for each value of @xmath19 and the red circles are window average values over all distributions ( the error bars are 95% confidence intervals obtained via bootstrapping ) .",
    "the dashed lines are the analytical predictions of eq .",
    "( [ eqcombusual ] ) ; specifically , in ( c ) the dashed line is the distribution of eq  ( [ pxixcollapsed ] ) and in ( d ) it is the standard gaussian @xmath85 .",
    "in addition to the good ( visual ) agreement between simulations and analytical expressions , we have found that the @xmath86-values of the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( testing the equality of the empirical and analytical distributions ) are all larger than @xmath87 , indicating that the hypothesis of the analytical distributions describing our data can not be rejected at a confidence level of 95% . ]",
    "convinced of the equivalence in the usual case , we now address the role of the long - range correlations on the diffusive properties of a random walker described by our langevin equations  ( [ leqcomb ] ) .",
    "we first investigate how the memory effects in the @xmath2direction modify the diffusion in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions . in order to do so",
    ", we have built an ensemble of @xmath55 particle positions considering @xmath56 and @xmath44 for each one of nineteen values of @xmath37 homogeneously distributed between @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "for each value of @xmath37 , we evaluate the temporal evolution of the variances @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "figures  [ fig4](a ) and  [ fig4](b ) show the variance profiles in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions , respectively . in these plots ,",
    "the dashed lines represent the behavior for the usual comb , that is , when no correlations are present . in the case of @xmath59 , we note that the more the noise in @xmath1 is anti - persistent ( @xmath53 ) , the larger is the power - law exponent @xmath89 describing the behavior of @xmath59 ; in contrast , persistent noise in @xmath1 slows down the diffusion and decreases the power - law exponent @xmath89 . the extreme cases where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are characterized by @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "thus , as we have first noticed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , anti - persistent noise in @xmath1 forces the walker to return more frequently to the strip where it can move in the @xmath3direction and , consequently , the diffusion is enhanced when compared with the case usual comb ( @xmath49 ) . on the other hand , persistent noise in @xmath1",
    "drives the walker away from strip and , consequently , the diffusion slows down . in the case of @xmath60 ,",
    "the behavior is straightforward : anti - persistent noise in @xmath1 slows down the diffusion while persistent noise enhances it [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] . in order to quantify the role of long - range correlations in @xmath1 on @xmath59 and @xmath60 ,",
    "we have evaluated the dependence of the power - law exponents @xmath89 and @xmath94 on @xmath37 . in fig .",

    "[ fig4](d ) , we confirm the straightforward behavior of @xmath94 as function of @xmath37 ( @xmath95 ) .    another interesting question is whether the combinations of long - range correlated noises in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions affect the diffusive behaviors in a nontrivial way . to answer this question ,",
    "we have built an ensemble of @xmath55 particle positions for each possible pair of @xmath36 and @xmath37 homogeneously distributed between @xmath87 and @xmath88 with step size of @xmath87 .",
    "for each combination of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we calculate the profile of the variances @xmath59 and @xmath60 and also the power - law exponents @xmath89 and @xmath94 describing the main tendency of these curves ( by using the same procedure of fig .",

    "figure  [ fig5](a ) shows a contour plot of @xmath89 as a function of @xmath36 and @xmath37 and fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) represents the same for @xmath94 . for the fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , we note a quite rich diffusive scenery where , depending on the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we may have subdiffusion slower ( @xmath96 ) or faster ( @xmath97 ) than the usual comb , usual diffusion ( @xmath98 ) and even superdiffusion ( @xmath99 ) .",

    "the case of fig  [ fig5](b ) is rather simple because the correlations in @xmath0 do not affect the diffusive behavior in the @xmath2direction , this becomes evident by noting that the level curves of @xmath94 are horizontal straight lines .     and @xmath1 directions on the variances @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "we further observe that the power - law exponent @xmath89 can not be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , suggesting a more complex coupling between the hurst exponents and diffusion in the @xmath3direction . ]",
    "it is also important to investigate whether the long - range correlations affect the distribution profiles of the particle positions . in order to do so",
    ", we first calculate the marginal distributions @xmath84 and @xmath78 for there different values of @xmath37 ( @xmath87 , @xmath100 and @xmath88 ) and keeping @xmath101 .",

    "@xmath102 are not affected by long - range correlated noises in the @xmath2direction .",
    "we thus confirm that the long - range correlations in @xmath1 have influence on the profiles of @xmath84 . for a better and quantitative characterization of the role of the correlated noise @xmath27 on the shape of @xmath84",
    ", we evaluate the coefficient of kurtosis @xmath103 in function of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath104 the distribution is leptokurtic ( peaked ) while for @xmath105 the distribution is platykurtic ( flat ) also , @xmath106 for a gaussian distribution and @xmath107 for the usual comb ( distribution of the eq .",
    "[ pxixcollapsed ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig6](c ) shows a contour plot of @xmath108 as a function of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where we observe that the kurtosis ranges from very close to @xmath109 ( @xmath110 for @xmath111 ) up to almost @xmath112 ( @xmath113 for @xmath114 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , similar to the variance case [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) ] , the kurtosis @xmath108 is not a trivial combination of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .     and ( b ) @xmath78 for there values of @xmath37 ( indicated in the plots ) and @xmath44 . in both plots ,",
    "the light shaded regions represent a standard gaussian , while the dark shaded region in ( a ) is the profile of the marginal distribution for @xmath115 of the usual comb [ eq .",
    "( [ pxixcollapsed ] ) ] . for @xmath84",
    ", we note that the distribution tails decay slower than those of usual comb when the noise in the @xmath2direction is persistent ( @xmath91 ) ; whereas for anti - persistent noise ( @xmath90 ) , the tails decay faster and approach the gaussian distribution . in the case @xmath78 , the long - range correlations in @xmath1 have practically no effect on the profile of these distributions .",
    "( c ) contour plot of the coefficient of kurtosis @xmath103 for the normalized position @xmath115 as a function of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the value of @xmath108 is an average over @xmath19 within the interval @xmath116 .",
    "we note that , depending on the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the distribution @xmath84 exhibits different profiles , which can be mesokurtic ( @xmath106 , as in the gaussian case ) , leptokurtic ( @xmath104 ) or platykurtic ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "we also observe that , similarly to variance case , @xmath108 can not be expressed in terms of linear combination of @xmath36 and @xmath37 . ]",
    "we have proposed an extension for the comb model via langevin equations driven by long - range correlated noises ( fractional gaussian noises ) .",
    "we initially showed that our langevin equations are equivalent to the generalized diffusion equation ( describing the usual comb ) through the comparison of the numerical - obtained variances and marginal distributions with the analytical results predicted by the diffusion equation .",
    "next , we have presented an extensive characterization of the diffusive properties of the particle positions in function of the hurst exponents @xmath36 and @xmath37 defining the correlated noises .",
    "our results show that the noise in the @xmath2direction affects the variances and marginal distributions along the @xmath3direction .",
    "specifically , long - range persistence in @xmath1 slows down the diffusion in @xmath0 by reducing the power - law exponent @xmath89 and makes the tails of the marginal distribution @xmath84 longer as @xmath52 increases ; whereas long - range anti - persistence in @xmath1 enhances the diffusion in @xmath0 by increasing the value of @xmath89 and makes the tails of @xmath84 shorter as @xmath53 decreases .",
    "we have also investigated the interplay between the long - range correlations in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions , where we found that both @xmath89 and the kurtosis coefficient @xmath108 of @xmath84 are not a trivial ( such as a linear combination ) function of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , but instead our results suggest a more complex coupling between the hurst exponents and the diffusion in the @xmath3direction . in summary ,",
    "a quite rich diffusive scenery emerges from our model which may be directly applied for describing ( at least in a first approximation ) some of the recent empirical findings related to diffusion in complex systems such as living cells .",
    "furthermore , our model combines and allows the study / analysis of the interplay between different mechanisms of anomalous diffusion , geometric constraints and long - range correlations , an important fact that had not been explored within the comb model framework and that may provide a better understanding of these processes as a combination of different mechanisms .",

    "<S> , we propose an extension for the comb model via langevin - like equations driven by fractional gaussian noises ( long - range correlated ) . by carrying out computer simulations , we show that the correlations in the @xmath2direction affect the diffusive behavior in the @xmath3direction in a non - trivial fashion , resulting in a quite rich diffusive scenario characterized by usual , superdiffusive or subdiffusive scaling of second moment in the @xmath3direction . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that the long - range correlations affect the probability distribution of the particle positions in the @xmath3direction , making their tails longer when noise in the @xmath2direction is persistent and shorter for anti - persistent noise . </S>",
    "<S> our model thus combines and allows the study / analysis of the interplay between different mechanisms of anomalous diffusion ( geometric constraints and long - range correlations ) and may find direct applications for describing diffusion in complex systems such as living cells .    </S>",
