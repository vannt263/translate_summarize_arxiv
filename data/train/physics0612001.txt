    "recent measurements @xcite have characterized surface waves arising from optical excitation of a series of subwavelength slit - groove structures fabricated on silver films . the amplitude , wavelength and phase of these surface waves have been measured over a slit - groove distance of a few microns . after an initial rapid amplitude decrease extending to @xmath7  @xmath1 m from the slit edge , the interference fringe persists over several microns with a near - constant amplitude and a contrast @xmath8 .",
    "the  near - zone \" of rapidly changing surface wave character indicates initial transient phenomena , while the longer - range  far - zone \" settling to constant amplitude and contrast is the signature of a guided mode surface plasmon polariton ( spp ) .",
    "the measured interference fringe wavelength @xmath9  nm resulted in the determination of an effective index of refraction @xmath10 , significantly higher than expected from conventional theory@xcite , @xmath11 .",
    "the question naturally arose as to whether this result is simply a consequence of interference fringe sampling over an interval predominantly in a transient near - zone peculiar to silver films , or was related to the specific surface properties of the silver films deposited on fused silica@xcite , or may indicate a more _ generic _ phenomenon related to the transient properties of surface waves , generated by subwavelength slits , within 2 - 3 wavelengths of the edge of origin .",
    "subsequent investigation of the physical - chemical properties of the silver films confirmed that they were free of surface contaminants , and fdtd simulations showed excellent agreement with the experimental results in silver films@xcite .    in order to explore these surface waves further",
    "we have carried out a series of experiments similar to those already reported but using evaporated gold films instead of silver .",
    "we performed only  output - side \" experiments@xcite because they yield a phase modulated interference fringe less susceptible to noise than the amplitude modulation signal of the  input - side \" experiments@xcite .",
    "in addition we have compared the measurements to detailed field amplitude and phase maps generated by fdtd numerical solutions @xcite to the maxwell equations in the vicinity of the slit - groove structure .",
    "both experiments and fdtd simulation show that the surface wave exhibits transient properties in wavelength and amplitude in the near - zone .",
    "this transient behavior can be interpreted in terms of surface modes all of which dissipate beyond the near - zone except for @xmath5 , the bound surface mode .",
    "the structures were fabricated with a focused ion beam ( fib ) station as described previously in @xcite .",
    "the experiments were performed on the same home - built goniometer setup used in the silver studies . for convenience ,",
    "figs.1,2 of @xcite are reproduced here to show the principle of the measurement and the schematic arrangement of the apparatus .",
    "output from a temperature stabilized diode laser source , is modulated at 850 hz by a mechanical chopper , injected into a monomode optical fibre , focused and linearly polarized ( tm polarization , h - field parallel to the slit long axis ) before impinging perpendicularly on the matrix of structures mounted in a sample holder .",
    "the beam waist diameter and confocal parameter of the illuminating source are 300  @xmath1 m and 33  cm , respectively .",
    "the sample holder itself is fixed to a precision x - y translator , and individual slit - groove structures of the 2-d matrix are successively positioned at the laser beam waist .",
    "a photodiode detector is mounted at the end of a 200 mm rigid arm that rotates about the center of the sample holder .",
    "a stepper motor drives the arm at calibrated angular increments of 1.95 mrad per step , and the overall angular resolution of the goniometer is @xmath12 mrad .",
    "the photodetector output current passes to a lock - in amplifier referenced to the optical chopper wheel .",
    "data are collected on a personal computer that also controls the goniometer drive .",
    "with the detector rotated perpendicular to the structure plane ( @xmath13 in figs.[fig : interferencediag],[fig : goniometre ] ) the expression for the normalized detected intensity @xmath14 as a function of slit - groove distance @xmath6 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is related to the fringe contrast @xmath17 through @xmath18 in the argument of the cosine term @xmath19 relates the propagation parameter of the surface wave to the effective surface wavelength , and the  intrinsic phase \" @xmath20 is any phase contribution not directly due to the propagation path length @xmath6 .",
    "it may be associated with phase shifts at the slit or groove structures .",
    "the interferometry measurements were carried out on 4 separate substrates , each substrate containing about 50 structures in which the the slit - groove separation was systematically varied from 50  nm to more than 12  @xmath1 m in increments of 50  nm .     as a function of slit - groove distance @xmath6 .",

    "the @xmath31 map clearly shows the dipolar charge distribution concentrated at the corners of the slit on the input and output planes of the structure .",
    "these corner charge concentrations result from currents induced on the input side of the gold film by the magnetic field components @xmath32 shown in fig.[fig : hx ] .",
    "the incident light propagates from below through the fused silica substrate onto the gold film and through the 100  nm wide , 400  nm thick slit .",
    "the incident light is tm polarized and the guided mode propagating along the @xmath33 direction within the slit sets up a standing wave resulting in a high @xmath31 , @xmath32 amplitudes at the output plane .",
    "the groove is at the output side of the gold film ; and , in the simulations depicted , the distance between the center of the slit and the center of the groove is 3.18  @xmath1 m .",
    "the absolute value of the z - component of the electric field amplitude @xmath31 just above ( or just below ) the gold film is proportional to the surface charge density at the film surface . note that on the output side surface , in the region between the groove and the slit , the surface wave excited at the left edge of the slit travels to the groove , is reflected from the groove s right edge ,",
    "then interferes with itself .",
    "the standing wave is clearly visible on and near the output side surface . within the slit , on the vertical walls",
    ", @xmath34 is fairly strong as well . here",
    ", however , @xmath34 is parallel to the metallic surface , and its presence within the skin depth of the slit walls does not signify the existence of surface charges ; instead , the @xmath34-field in this region is responsible for the surface currents that carry the charges back and forth between the entrance and exit facets of the slit .",
    "figure [ fig : hx ] shows the magnitude of the magnetic field @xmath32 over the same region as fig.[fig : ez ] .",
    "interference fringes between the incident and reflected beams on fused silica substrate are clearly visible . note also the interference fringes between the excited evanescent waves ( mainly spp ) and the incident beam on the entrance facet of the gold film adjacent the substrate . inside the slit",
    ", @xmath32 shows a dark band ; this is caused by interference between the upward - moving guided mode within the slit and the reflected , downward - travelling mode .",
    "in addition to the electric and magnetic field components @xmath35 at the surface , the light transmission efficiency in the @xmath36 direction through the slit as a function of slit - groove distance @xmath6 was calculated and is shown in fig.[fig : tvsd ] .",
    "the transmission efficiency @xmath37 is defined as the ratio of the @xmath36-component of the poynting vector @xmath38 on the output side , integrated over @xmath39 , to the total energy flux incident on the slit @xmath40 .",

    "the red trace plots the transmission efficiency @xmath41 as a function of @xmath6 at the output plane . as expected the transmission efficiency exhibits pronounced oscillations with a rapid decrease in amplitude in the near - zone followed by a constant amplitude oscillation out to 6  @xmath1 m , the calculation limit . in the far - zone",
    "the blue trace fits the oscillations to a single cosine function , @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "these oscillations , as can be seen in figs.[fig : ez ] and[fig : hx ] , arise from the superposition of waves launched from the slit and back reflected at the groove . because these waves are counterpropagating along @xmath39 , rather than copropagating along @xmath36 , the intensity fringe frequency is twice the fringe frequency of the far - field interferometry results expressed by eq.[eq : fringes ] . this standing wave at the output plane results in @xmath43= 2\\left\\{1+\\cos 2\\left[\\varphi\\left(x_{\\mathrm{sg}}\\right)\\right]\\right\\ } \\label{eq : szstandingwave}\\ ] ]",
    "taking into account this factor of two in the argument of the @xmath44 term , the fringe oscillation in the asymptotic far - zone is in good agreement with measurement and the expected spp . in the near - zone",
    "the oscillation @xmath45 exhibits a definite  chirp , \" and fig.[fig : calculated - phase - error ] plots the deviation from the asymptotic value @xmath26 as function of @xmath6 .",
    "comparing fig.[fig : calculated - phase - error ] to fig.[fig : phase - error - detail ] we see that the fdtd results accord well with deviations in the interferometric fringes measured in the far- field .",
    "the index of refraction for the bound surface - plasmon - polariton @xmath46 is given by the raether formula@xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the real parts of the dielectric constants of metal and dielectric at the interface on which the surface wave propagates .",
    "interpolation of reflectivity data for gold@xcite at 852  nm yields @xmath50 and from eq.[fig : raether n ] the surface index of refraction for the surface plasmon polariton at the gold - air interface is @xmath51 . the measured surface index of refraction reported here , to within experimental uncertainty and in the far - zone , is in accord with the spp prediction .",
    "the results from the fdtd calculations are also in agreement with the experimental results and the spp predictions .",
    "it appears therefore that in the far - zone , for both silver / air and gold / air surfaces , far - field interferometry and fdtd calculations show that the surviving long - range surface wave is indeed the expected bound surface plasmon polariton .",
    "table[table ] summarizes the relevant parameters , far - field interferometric measurements , and finite - difference - time - dependent ( fdtd ) numerical simulations for gold and silver .        in the near - zone",
    "both experiment and numerical simulation show that the surface wave deviates from pure spp behavior .",
    "the effective propagation parameter @xmath53 , originating near the slit edge , appears greater than @xmath5 and evolves smoothly to the bound mode over the near - zone interval of a few microns .",
    "this behavior may be interpreted either in terms of initial excitation of a composite evanescent surface  wave packet \" in @xmath54-space at the slit edge@xcite , followed by subsequent decay of all surface modes except the bound @xmath5 mode or in terms of detailed field matching at the boundaries within the slit and near the slit edges@xcite .",
    "these two points of view both invoke evanescent modes @xmath55 in order to satisfy boundary conditions in the vicinity of the slit edge , but standard wave - guide theory dictates that only the spp mode is stable against phonon coupling to the bulk metal or to radiative decay .",
    "we can estimate the the surface distance over which the dissipation occurs by appealing to the standard drude model of a metal that expresses the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant @xmath56 in terms of the bulk plasmon resonance @xmath57 and a damping constant @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 in eq.[eq : drudemodel ] @xmath60 is the permittivity of free space and @xmath61 is the dimensionless infinite frequency limit of the dielectric constant .",
    "the drude model is based on a damped harmonic oscillator model of an electron plasma in which the electrons oscillate about positive ion centers with characteristic frequency @xmath57 , subject to a phenomenological damping rate @xmath58 , normally assumed to be due to electron - phonon coupling .",
    "values for @xmath58 are typically @xmath62  s@xmath63 , and in fact for au the value is @xmath64  s@xmath63 . for a wave propagating on the surface with group velocity @xmath65  ms@xmath63 the expected decay length @xmath66 m , consistent with the measurements and fdtd simulations .    in summary",
    "the picture that emerges from far - field interferometry and fdtd simulation studies of these simple slit - groove structures on silver and gold films is that in the near - zone of slit - groove distances , on the order of a few wavelengths , the surface wave consists of a composite of several evanescent modes all of which dissipate within this near - zone .",
    "only the bound , stable spp mode survives into the far - zone , and in the studies reported here we have observed essentially constant spp amplitude out to 12  @xmath1 m , a distance limited only by our fabricated structures .",
    "earlier measurements@xcite indicate that absorption and surface roughness scattering should permit propagation lengths as far as @xmath67 m .",
