    "the reader will recall that a fox coloring of a knot diagram is a labeling of the arcs of the diagram with the elements of @xmath11 for some integer @xmath12 , such that at each crossing the sums of the labels of the under - crossing arcs is equal to twice the labeling of the over - crossing arc .",
    "this is often expressed by the equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the labels for the under - crossing arcs and @xmath16 is the label for the over - crossing arc ( see figure [ fig : x ] ) .",
    "colorings of knots were introduced by fox in @xcite .",
    "minimum number of colors were introduced by harary and the first author in @xcite where they conjectured that given a prime @xmath3 along with a reduced alternating diagram of a knot with determinant @xmath3 , then this diagram endowed with a non - trivial @xmath3-coloring would bear different colors on different arcs .",
    "this conjecture has now been proven true in @xcite .",
    "still in @xcite it was remarked that an alternating knot of prime determinant @xmath3 could be non - trivially colored with less colors if one used diagrams other than alternating .",
    "this remark was made by irina teneva who provided the following example , see figure [ fig : decompteneva ] .",
    "a few words about our figures seem to be in order .",
    "braid closure of each diagram in the figures is understood except where otherwise noted or clear from context .",
    "we do not depict these braid closures in order not to overburden the figures . a circled number on the top left of a figure will stand for the modulus with respect to which the colorings are being considered .",
    "figure [ fig : decompteneva ] shows a @xmath17 ( whose determinant is @xmath8 ) endowed with a non - trivial @xmath8-coloring under four guises .",
    "the left - most diagram is a reduced alternating diagram thus complying with the kauffman - harary conjecture : distinct arcs bear distinct colors . but the rightmost diagram is a non - alternating diagram colored with less colors , @xmath18 to be precise .",
    "this is teneva s example .",
    "the progression from the leftmost to the rightmost diagram is our decomposition of teneva s example which allowed to generalize it to other @xmath19 s , see @xcite .",
    "we thus briefly remark that the so - called teneva transformations are applicable to colored @xmath19 s .",
    "each teneva transformation consists of a finite sequence of reidemeister moves , each move accompanied by a corresponding local alteration in the colors in order to make the colorings before and after the reidemeister move compliant with each other .",
    "a teneva transformation begins then with a kink , it is followed by a first type iii reidemeister move which does not yet alter the number of colors , it is followed by a second type iii reidemeister move which removes one color , and this is repeated until the application of such moves introduces old colors instead of removing them .",
    "figure [ fig : decompteneva ] is the materialization of what we just described for @xmath20 . for",
    "a more elaborate discussion see @xcite .",
    "it should be clear that it is not possible to further apply teneva transformations to the right - most diagram of figure [ fig : decompteneva ] in order to reduce the number of colors .",
    "on the other hand , for larger @xmath21 s , it is possible to effectively apply teneva transformations to the @xmath22 s left over from the application of the first set of teneva transformations , or even from subsequent applications of teneva transformations .",
    "we call this iterating the teneva transformations .",
    "this is the teneva game .",
    "figure [ fig : t2 - 11 ] should help at this point .",
    "after a first application of the teneva transformations , the diagram is split into two @xmath23 s ( figure [ fig : t2 - 11 ] , second diagram from the left ) .",
    "teneva transformations are then applied to these @xmath23 s splitting them into @xmath24 s ( third diagram from the left ) .    in the current article",
    "we iterate the teneva transformations over torus knots of type @xmath2 , for prime @xmath25 in order to obtain sharper upper bounds for the minimum number of colors of these @xmath1 modulo @xmath3 ( theorem [ thm : thm ] ) . furthermore , letting @xmath26 stand for the minimum number of colors needed to realize a non - trivial @xmath21-coloring of knot / link @xmath27 modulo @xmath21 , we show ( corollary [ cor : mincol11 ] ) that @xmath28    in @xcite it was proven that given a non - split link @xmath29 admitting non - trivial @xmath30 colorings then @xmath31 , for a certain prime @xmath32 .",
    "for this reason the moduli with respect to which we will be working with here will be odd primes .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : prelim ] we introduce the objects which simplify the statement of our results , and we state these results in theorem [ thm : thm ] , and corollaries [ cor : mincol11 ] and [ cor : mincol ] . in section",

    "in section [ sect : preview ] we offer the reader a preview of our next project .",
    "in this section we begin by introducing terminology and notation which will simplify the statement of the main results .",

    "we call * lower half of @xmath33 * the integer @xmath34 such that @xmath35 our notation for this situation will be : @xmath36 for an even integer , the lower half of it coincides with the ordinary half .",
    "we remark that we could have also defined the * upper half * of an odd integer @xmath33 as the integer @xmath34 such that @xmath37 , together with the statement that for even integers it also coincides with the ordinary half , but we do not seem to need this object in the present article .",
    "[ def : slh ] let @xmath21 be an integer greater than @xmath18 .",
    "we define * sequence of lower halves of @xmath21 * as follows .",
    "the first term of this sequence is : @xmath38    if @xmath39 , then this is the last term of the sequence . otherwise , @xmath40    roughly speaking , the sequence of lower halves is the sequence of iterates of the function @xmath41 applied to @xmath21 and terminating at the first iterate in @xmath42 .",
    "our notation for the sequence of lower halves of @xmath21 is @xmath43 , and @xmath44 for its terms .",
    "given an integer @xmath21 along with its sequence of lower halves , @xmath45 , we call * length of the sequence * , notation @xmath46 , the number of terms in the sequence .",
    "we call * tail of the sequence * , notation @xmath47 , the last term of the sequence , @xmath48 .    for each prime @xmath25",

    "we prove theorem [ thm : thm ] in this section .",
    "we start by considering some examples namely , @xmath9 and @xmath62 . in the course of analyzing @xmath9 we prove corollary [ cor : mincol11 ] .",
    "we remark that @xmath63 consider figure [ fig : t2 - 11 ] .",
    "( here and in the sequel , kinks drawn in a thinner line indicate the beginning of the teneva transformation depicted in the diagram to the right of the one where the kink is found . )",
    "the first set of teneva transformations performed on @xmath9 takes an arc over the diagram , splitting it into two @xmath23 s .",
    "this is depicted in the second diagram from the left in figure [ fig : t2 - 11 ] .",
    "this transformation removes colors @xmath64 through @xmath65 ; this is the removal of @xmath66 colors for @xmath67 .",
    "why did this first set of teneva transformations take this arc to split this diagram like it did ?",
    "well , had this arc gone over more crossings or less crossings than it did then it would have eliminated less colors . in the general case of a @xmath68 endowed with a non - trivial @xmath69-coloring",
    ", the maximum reduction of colors by one set of teneva transformations is accomplished when the diagram is split into two @xmath70 s , yielding @xmath71 distinct colors ( here k=5 ) .",
    "this is carefully discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us resume the analysis of figure [ fig : t2 - 11 ] , on the second diagram from the left .",
    "the diagram is split into two @xmath23 s .",
    "teneva transformations can be applied effectively to each of these @xmath23 s , reducing their common set of colors .",
    "the starting points for the new teneva transformations are indicated by the kinks and the result is depicted on the third diagram from the left .",
    "color @xmath18 has been removed from this diagram ; this is the removal of @xmath72 colors for @xmath73 .",
    "finally , the rightmost diagram depicts a transformation which removes color @xmath8 leaving the diagram with @xmath8 colors : @xmath74 .",
    "according to @xcite , theorem @xmath75 , @xmath76 ( see also @xcite ) , this is the least number of colors such a knot can exhibit in a non - trivial @xmath10-coloring .",
    "therefore @xmath77 which concludes the proof of corollary [ cor : mincol11 ] .",
    "the following features of this example should be retained . with the indicated values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the first set of teneva transformations ( the passage from the leftmost diagram to the next diagram in figure [ fig : t2 - 11 ] ) removes @xmath80 colors namely , colors @xmath81 through @xmath82 .",
    "the next set of teneva transformations ( the passage from the second diagram from the left to the third ) removes @xmath83 colors , namely colors @xmath84 through @xmath85 ( which in this case is just @xmath57 color ) .",
    "it should also be noted that @xmath78 is odd ; were it even then this second set of teneva transformations would have removed only @xmath86 as we will note in the next example , see figure [ fig : t2 - 13 ] .",
    "finally , the passage from the third from the left diagram to the right - most diagram removes color @xmath78 .",
    "the total number of colors in the end is @xmath87    let us now analyze figure [ fig : t2 - 13 ] .",
    "here we have @xmath88    the relevant difference from the preceding case is that here @xmath78 is even .",
    "although the first set of teneva transformations ( the passage from the left - most to the center diagram ) involve again the removal of @xmath80 colors namely , colors @xmath89 through @xmath82 , the second set of teneva transformations involve the removal of @xmath90 colors namely , colors @xmath91 through @xmath92 ( which in this case is only @xmath57 color ) . in general , the following occurs .",
    "suppose @xmath44 is not the tail of the sequence of lower halves of the modulus at issue .",
    "if @xmath44 is odd then the @xmath93-th set of teneva transformations will remove @xmath94 colors ; otherwise it will remove @xmath95 colors .",
    "back to figure [ fig : t2 - 13 ] , the boxed regions in the right - most diagram indicate where to operate in order to remove color @xmath78 which in this case is @xmath96 .",
    "since this is graphically more involved then the removal of the odd @xmath78 ( see figure [ fig : t2 - 11 ] ) , it is displayed in figure [ fig : t2 - 13localtransf ] .",
    "inspiration for these moves comes from @xmath97 .",
    "figure [ fig : t2 - 13final ] incorporates this removal of color @xmath96 , broken down in figure [ fig : t2 - 13localtransf ] , thus displaying the final result .",
    "the total number of colors in the end is @xmath98 .",
    "we are now ready for the general case .",
    "we remark that removal of color @xmath78 in the general case is obtained in a straightforward way from the two preceding examples .",
    "for instance , for even @xmath78 with figure [ fig : t2 - 13localtransf ] in mind , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 . in order to prove theorem [ thm : thm ] we use the following lemma .",
