    "the most naive method would be matching the propagator and vertex function computed in the continuum theory up to some order in perturbation theory with the ri - mom npr  @xcite calculation on the lattice ( figure  [ pt_matching ] ) .",

    "a further advantage of such an entirely non - perturbative matching is that the kinematic `` window '' for performing such matching now has no lower bound since there is no requirement that the perturbation theory be accurate .",
