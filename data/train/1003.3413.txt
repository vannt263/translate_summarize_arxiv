    "the observation of an anomalous quantization of the hall resistance in graphene at high magnetic fields , @xcite related to the massless , relativistic - like spectrum of low - energy electrons on the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice , has triggered much excitation in recent years , see ref . for a review .",
    "indeed , the experimentally measured hall resistance follows the landau - level structure expected for massless dirac electrons , @xcite @xmath2 in the clean case , with @xmath1 a positive integer and @xmath3 the graphene characteristic frequency given in terms of the fermi velocity @xmath4 and of the magnetic length @xmath5 ( here @xmath6 is the electron charge , @xmath7 the speed of light , and @xmath8 the magnetic field strength ) .",
    "the @xmath9 dependence of the characteristic frequency @xmath10 in graphene , to be contrasted with the linear dependence of the cyclotron frequency @xmath11 of more standard two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) based on semiconducting heterostructures ( in this case , @xmath12 is the electronic effective mass ) described by schrdinger equation , constitutes one of the main signatures used so far in experiments to exhibit the relativistic - like character of the massless charge carriers .",
    "also quite remarkable is that graphene displays a surface opened to the outside world , providing a direct window to its electronic excitations .",
    "this is a clear experimental advantage of graphene compared to 2degs based on semiconducting heterostructures , where the 2deg is buried deep inside the structure ( typically 100 nm or more ) .",
    "graphene thus offers the opportunity to obtain precise insights into local physical properties of quantum - hall systems , such as the local density of states ( ldos ) via scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) measurements .",
    "in contrast , such local probes experiments have very poor spatial resolution in ordinary heterostructures , although some progress has been made recently , see ref . .",
    "this technical advantage will be certainly important in the future to elucidate the relation between microscopic inhomogeneities induced by various disorder types and macroscopic transport properties of large samples .",
    "various open questions in this respect are the nature of the universal plateau to plateau quantum phase transition , @xcite or on a more quantitative level the precise formation of wide hall plateaus .",
    "to pursue this goal , sts is one of the interesting available experimental techniques , and first experiments in graphene at high magnetic field have been performed recently .",
    "@xcite since this spectroscopic method gives direct information on the local electronic states , a better understanding of the ldos , specific to the case of graphene at high magnetic fields and in arbitrary potential landscapes ( without proceeding to disorder averaging ) , needs to be achieved .",
    "this is the main aim of the present paper .",
    "a second important aspect of our work is to obtain analytical solutions for a large class of parabolic confinement models , and as a motivation we now discuss the different types of potentials that can be involved in the two - dimensional dirac hamiltonian .      because of the multicomponent structure of the wave function for graphene , several types of disorder can occur , which we introduce here .",
    "the quasiparticle dispersion for graphene has two dirac cones ( two `` valleys '' ) at low energies . for a given valley ,",
    "the hamiltonian in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field has a matrix structure and is written as @xmath13 where @xmath4 is the fermi velocity , @xmath14 is a vector whose components are the pauli matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the pseudospin space , and the momentum operator is @xmath17 the vector potential @xmath18 is related to the uniform transverse magnetic field @xmath19 via the relation @xmath20 . for convenience , we will omit both physical spin and valley indices , thus assuming that the two valleys of graphene remain completely decoupled from each other and can be studied separately .",
    "@xcite    quite generally , potential terms appear as either a random scalar potential , a random dirac mass or a random vector potential .",
    "@xcite the hamiltonian in presence of these potentials is given by @xmath21 where the function @xmath22 takes the general form @xmath23 with @xmath24 the identity matrix in the pseudospin space , associated to the scalar potential term @xmath25 .",
    "this contribution may have many different physical origins : electrostatic confinement potential , impurity random potential , and/or hartree potential resulting from the mean - field mutual coulomb interaction between the electrons .",
    "the diagonal but antisymmetric term @xmath26 , associated to the @xmath27 pauli matrix , describes the so - called random mass potential .",
    "this contribution might be introduced by the underlying substrate in single - layer graphene , while in bilayer graphene , such a term can be produced in a controllable way by introducing different electrostatic potentials in the two layers .",
    "@xcite the off - diagonal contributions coming as @xmath28 $ ] can be associated with a random vector potential , coming from the spatial distortion of the graphene sheet in the third dimension by ripples .",
    "@xcite in what follows , all three possible types of disorder will be considered within the high magnetic field regime .",
    "let us first discuss various toy models of potentials ( in a magnetic field ) that were studied in the recent graphene literature .",
    "quite generally , within the dirac equation fewer models can be solved exactly than within its non - relativistic counterpart .",
    "for instance , the classic one - dimensional parabolic confinement model , as well as the circular parabolic confinement model , are seemingly not analytically tractable . for the 2deg ,",
    "the former is the well - known model to introduce the edge states and explain the quantized conductance in hall bars .",
    "the latter is the basic model for quantum dots and leads under magnetic field to the fock - darwin states with discrete energies .",
    "thus , only much simpler models can be solved analytically for graphene , such as the uniform electric field .",
    "@xcite progress can be achieved for circular hard - wall confinement with either scalar @xcite or mass @xcite potentials , but only a solution in terms of special functions is then possible . for parabolic and more complex potentials ,",
    "fully numerical methods have to be used , e.g. , see ref . .",
    "we will show in this paper that the limit of negligible landau level mixing allows one to solve analytically a large class of parabolic models , providing new insights in the high magnetic field regime .",
    "coming to the more complex question of disorder , even less is actually known .",
    "recent work devoted to the quantum - hall effect in graphene has proposed to take into account disorder phenomenologically in the expression of green s function by adding a constant imaginary part @xmath29 in the self - energy , @xcite but hall quantization obtains only in the limit where the energy rate @xmath30 .",
    "the ldos in the vicinity of a single pointlike impurity and in the presence of a strong magnetic field has been studied recently .",
    "@xcite various types of disorders were also considered in refs . and within the self - consistent born approximation .",
    "while this method may be justified for short - range scatterers , it turns out @xcite to be inappropriate for a smooth potential in high magnetic fields .",
    "because a quasi - local picture takes place in the high magnetic field regime , @xcite our calculation will be able to provide accurate expression for the ldos in smooth",
    "_ arbitrary _ potentials .",
    "the strategy to follow is best explained by starting to discuss the specific nature of disorder for 2degs at high magnetic field .",
    "for very clean heterostructures , the disordered potential seen by the electrons is mostly smooth on large length scales ( several tens of nanometers ) , as the majority of impurities sit far away from the 2deg .",
    "in contrast to the low magnetic field regime , where the electrons explore ergodically macroscopic regions of the sample , the high field regime is characterized by cyclotron motion close to equipotential lines of potential landscape @xmath31 with a narrow transverse spread proportional to the magnetic length ( which is smaller than 10 nm at several tesla ) . the disorder landscape",
    "felt by the electronic wave functions is therefore very smooth in that situation .",
    "we note that in graphene additional sharper potential variations ( such as atomic vacancies of the carbon layer , or local imperfections from the nearby substrate ) can occur , although these tend to be detrimental to quantum - hall physics by increasing the mixing of landau levels .",
    "the coupling to the substrate can however be removed by suspending graphene flakes or with a decoupled layer in epitaxial graphene , @xcite resulting in very high mobility samples .",
    "in fact , for both non - relativistic 2degs and graphene , the essence of the quantum hall effect lies already by considering smooth potential variations only , which is the case to be followed from now on .",
    "theoretically , this smooth disorder regime was shown to be problematic at high magnetic field for standard quantum - mechanical methods based on perturbative expansions in potential strength .",
    "@xcite in that case , the high magnetic field regime is the correct starting point , and is characterized by two different dimensionless small parameters : ( i ) @xmath32 associated to the transverse spread of the wave function along the classical guiding center @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the magnetic length and @xmath35 the typical length scale related to local variations in the potential ; ( ii ) @xmath36 associated to landau level mixing by local gradients @xmath37 of the potential , introducing @xmath38 the typical amplitude variations in the potential on the scale @xmath35 , and the cyclotron frequency @xmath39 in the 2deg case .",
    "clearly , quantum mechanics calls for non - zero @xmath32 , otherwise the so - called semiclassical guiding center picture at @xmath40 emerges , giving at best a qualitative picture , and missing important quantum effects such as level quantization , tunneling , or interferences effects due to the potential energy @xmath41 .",
    "the second parameter @xmath42 controls the degree of landau level mixing , so that landau levels strictly decouple at infinite @xmath39 .",
    "most previous works have considered either limits separately ( either @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) , and the necessary formalism to incorporate both non - zero @xmath34 and finite @xmath39 was developed for the standard 2deg by the authors in refs . , which will be extended in the present paper to the case of graphene .",
    "this mathematical construction shows that a local picture of the high magnetic field physics emerges in terms of semicoherent - state green s function , with a hierarchy of local energy scales @xcite ordered by powers of the magnetic length and successive spatial derivatives of the confinement or disordered potential .    in the simplified , yet fully quantum limit of infinite cyclotron frequency and non - zero @xmath34 ,",
    "initial progress was made by other authors in refs .   and",
    "for the 2deg case , where it was shown that schrdinger equation acquires a uni - dimensional character , offering an analysis for toy models of confinement or tunneling in the lowest landau level .",
    "the general structure of this limit was clarified in further developments in the greens - function formalism , @xcite and this will be also examined in detail for graphene in the present paper .",
    "our methodology is based on the exclusive use of green s functions , not wave functions , for the simple reason that we project the quantum dynamics onto a semi - coherent representation with nonorthogonal states , forcing us _",
    "de facto _ to give up the wave - functions picture .",
    "noticeably , because the overcomplete character of the chosen representation allows one to get rid of the hilbert - space formulation inherent to the traditional operator formulation of quantum mechanics , a unification of closed and open systems quantum mechanics is made possible here , i.e. , one can get and treat quantization and lifetime effects on an equal footing .",
    "an important application is the possibility to write down in the 2deg case a unique greens - function expression which holds for all cases of quadratic potentials .",
    "this derivation has clearly proved that the appearance of lifetimes ( expressing the presence of decaying states , i.e. , an intrinsic time asymmetry ) has for physical origin the instability of the dynamics occurring at saddle points of the potential landscape ; see ref . for a thorough discussion of this point .    in the graphene case , our calculation at large characteristic frequency @xmath45 ( or equivalently at large fermi velocity )",
    "brings important information , because , in contrast to standard 2degs , even simple models of parabolic confinement for graphene do not possess an analytic solution at finite @xmath10 .",
    "however , we will show that the limit @xmath46 is exactly solvable for most quadratic potentials , allowing us to extract the explicit discrete energy spectrum in case of several parabolic confinement models , and also , in principle , the transmission coefficients in case of tunneling near saddle points .",
    "going beyond these toy models , our general formalism also allows us to calculate in a controlled way the ldos in an _ arbitrary _ and possibly disordered potential landscape .",
    "our results will be discussed with respect to recent experimental findings .",
    "@xcite      first , in sec .",
    "[ sec : free ] , we shall investigate the free dirac hamiltonian in a transverse magnetic field , and introduce the graphene vortex states , which are the building blocks of the whole theory developed here .",
    "these states form an overcomplete family of semicoherent states , strongly localized around arbitrary guiding center positions @xmath33 , and encode the cyclotron motion quantum mechanically .    in subsequent sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] , we introduce the green s function for graphene vortex states and derive its general equation of motion , eq .",

    "[ sec : high ] , we show that the problem simplifies greatly in the limit of negligible landau level mixing .",
    "first , for locally flat potentials ( away from saddle points or bottom of potential wells ) , we find that the @xmath1th landau level acquires a dependence on the position @xmath33 , according to the simple formula , @xmath47^{2}}. \\label{effpot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath48 and @xmath49 are renormalized effective potentials that are simple functionals of the bare scalar and mass potentials ; for their definitions in terms of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , see eq .",
    "( [ tildev ] ) and the associated discussion in sec .",
    "[ matrix ] .",
    "second , when curvature of the potential is included , we find that simple analytic solutions for several parabolic models can be obtained .",
    "in particular , for circular parabolic _",
    "potential @xmath52 , the discrete energy spectrum ( in terms of landau level index @xmath53 and an extra quantum number @xmath54 , which is a positive integer @xmath55 ) reads : @xmath56 ( we have assumed @xmath57 above ) .",
    "apart from the well - known anomalous landau - level quantization with respect to quantum number @xmath1 , this result is very reminiscent of fock - darwin states for standard 2degs with respect to the linear dependence in the integer @xmath54 .",
    "more interestingly , for circular parabolic _ mass _ potential @xmath58 , the discrete energy spectrum displays now an anharmonic form @xmath59)^2 } \\label{spectrum2}\\ ] ] that was not obtained to our knowledge .",
    "generalization to non - circularly symmetric parabolic potentials is also readily obtained , as well as for the combination of uniform scalar and parabolic mass terms ( and vice versa ) , with detailed calculations appearing in several appendices .",
    "however , we show that potentials that combine sizeable spatial variations in both scalar and mass terms are in general not analytically tractable , even in the high magnetic field regime , except for the lowest landau level .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : deformation ] , we make explicit the connection of our formalism to the so - called deformation ( or weyl ) quantization , which corresponds to the proper way of quantizing the dynamics in phase space . for two - dimensional problems in a magnetic field ,",
    "the vortex state formalism is in fact performing a mixed representation of phase space in terms of the two - dimensional coordinates of the center of mass together with a discrete quantum number associated to landau levels while standard weyl quantization would introduce a four - dimensional description in terms of positions and momenta of the electron .",
    "this latter choice is however unpractical for the high magnetic field regime and this shows that the vortex states are most robust in this regime .",
    "as should be expected , in the limit of infinite frequency ( @xmath60 for the 2deg or @xmath61 for graphene ) , landau levels become fully decoupled , and the quantum dynamics reduces to a unidimensional one in terms of the two vortex coordinates , acting as conjugate variables . an effective one - dimensional picture of motion",
    "is thus rigorously obtained , overcoming certain regularization problems of the path - integral technique .",
    "@xcite    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : local ] , we provide generic expressions for the ldos in an _ arbitrary _ scalar or mass potential that can be described _ locally _ up to its first - order derivatives ( generalized graphene drift states ) .",
    "regarding recent experimental findings , we show that :    * positions , amplitudes , and widths of the ldos peaks qualitatively depend on the dominant type ( scalar or mass ) of local potential , see , e.g. , eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) ; * as the tip scans the surface , the ldos peak energy of the @xmath1th landau level follows the effective potential given in eq .",
    "( [ effpot ] ) , see fig .",
    "[ figveff ] , so that the resulting energy variations _ shrink _ with increasing @xmath1 , in agreement with the experimental findings for graphene  @xcite and standard 2deg ;  @xcite * on the contrary , the width of the ldos peaks at _ fixed _ tip position _ grows _ with increasing @xmath1 ( roughly as @xmath0 ) , as observed in ref . for graphene .",
    "such a dependence is also expected for the ordinary 2deg .",
    "before investigating the case of graphene under magnetic field , we briefly recall the vortex states for the case of the non - relativistic 2deg",
    ". this introduction will be useful to show that many physical and technical aspects of the 2deg can be directly transposed to the case of graphene ( studied in the next subsection ) .",
    "a single free electron of effective mass @xmath12 confined in a @xmath62 two - dimensional plane and subjected to a uniform magnetic field pointing in the perpendicular direction @xmath63 is described by the hamiltonian @xmath64 then , the eigenvalue problem @xmath65 leads to the well - known quantization of the kinetic energy into landau levels , @xmath66 with the cyclotron pulsation @xmath67 and @xmath68 a positive integer ( here @xmath69 is the magnetic length ) .",
    "it is important to note here the large degeneracy of the landau energy levels @xmath70 .",
    "indeed , for the motion of an electron in the two - dimensional plane , one expects at least two quantum numbers since there are two degrees of freedom .",
    "the degeneracy means that there is a great freedom in the choice of the second ( degeneracy ) quantum number , or equivalently , in the choice of a basis of eigenstates @xmath71 .",
    "consequently , there exist in the literature different ways to derive the energy quantization , eq .",
    "( [ sol1 ] ) .",
    "eigenstates characterized by a peculiar symmetry of the ( gauge - invariant ) probability density @xmath72 are preferentially chosen in many contexts .",
    "for instance , the landau states , with a conserved momentum as the degeneracy quantum number , are translationally invariant in one direction .",
    "@xcite circular eigenstates characterized by a rotation invariance around the origin @xcite are also well known and often used .",
    "it is worth stressing that the real difference between the landau states and the circular states is not the gauge because both kinds of states can be obtained in any gauge .",
    "@xcite the real difference is in the choice of the gauge - invariant quantum numbers , which are intimately related to the symmetry of the probability density @xmath72 .",
    "importantly , both landau and circular eigenstates do not reflect the symmetry of the cyclotron motion around an arbitrary point @xmath73 in the @xmath74 plane so that the consideration of the classical limit with these sets of states is rather tricky . since they do not correspond to the classical picture of the motion , it is difficult to appreciate the wave - particle duality . by imposing that the probability density @xmath72 of the eigenstates has the same symmetry as the cyclotron motion , i.e. , is a function of @xmath75 only , we get @xcite the so - called vortex states , given in the symmetrical gauge ( @xmath76 ) by @xmath77^{m } \\nonumber \\hspace*{1 cm } \\\\ \\times \\exp\\left [ -\\frac{(x - x)^{2}+(y - y)^{2}+2i(yx - xy)}{4 l_{b}^{2 } } \\right ] .",
    "\\label{sol2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for practical convenience , we shall now use the dirac bracket notation by writing @xmath78 . eigenstates ( [ sol2 ] ) of hamiltonian ( [ ham2d ] ) , associated with energy quantization ( [ sol1 ] ) , are characterized by the set of quantum numbers @xmath79 , where @xmath1 is a positive integer related to the quantization of the circulation around the vortex and @xmath73 is a continuous quantum number corresponding to the vortex location in the plane [ note with eq .",
    "( [ sol2 ] ) the `` vortex''-like phase singularity at @xmath80 for @xmath53 , which justifies the chosen denomination for the set of states ] .",
    "these localized wave functions clearly encode the classical cyclotron motion around the guiding center @xmath33 quantum mechanically .",
    "the vortex states form a semiorthogonal basis , with the overlap @xmath81 where @xmath82 . \\label{overlapr}\\ ] ] an important property is that the states ( [ sol2 ] ) present the coherent character with respect to the degeneracy quantum number @xmath33 , i.e. , they satisfy coherent states algebra .",
    "note that these states are however eigenstates of the free hamiltonian associated to the landau - level index @xmath1 , and form more precisely a semicoherent basis with respect to the quantum numbers ( @xmath1,@xmath83 . in particular , they also obey the following completeness relation @xmath84 according to this relation ( [ compvortex ] ) and general unicity properties of the decomposition onto coherent states , @xcite it is possible to expand arbitrary states or operators in the vortex state representation .",
    "hence , despite being nonorthogonal , the set of states @xmath79 with @xmath85 does form a basis of eigenstates , as the landau and the circular states .",
    "besides providing a clear quantum mechanical dual of the classical cyclotron motion , there are several good reasons to prefer specifically the vortex states over an orthogonal set of eigenstates to study the process of lifting of the landau level degeneracy in the presence of a smooth _ arbitrary _ potential .",
    "first , in contrast to the landau states or circular states , the vortex states do not impose a symmetry to the degeneracy quantum number , and thus permit a great adaptability to the spatial variations in the local electric fields , coming from either random impurity donors , confinement potentials , or macroscopic voltage drops ( in a nonequilibrium regime ) .",
    "this property leads to advantages in terms of computability since it is possible in the vortex representation to calculate and classify landau - level mixing processes in a simple and natural manner ( this will be illustrated in sec .",
    "[ matrix ] ) .",
    "second , at a more fundamental level , the vortex states are expected to be quite insensitive to any kind of smooth perturbations , since the quantum number @xmath1 has a purely topological origin in the vortex representation ( for the landau states or circular states , the quantization of the kinetic energy comes either partially or entirely from the condition of vanishing of the wave function at infinity , what makes them much less robust to perturbations as a result of their nonlocality ) .",
    "owing to this quantum robustness , the vortex states are thus naturally selected by the dynamics in the presence of a smooth potential with an arbitrary spatial dependence .",
    "they appear to be much more stable than their superpositions ( for instance , the landau states ) since they are the only states surviving under the action of such an interaction potential without any internal symmetry .",
    "interestingly , the vortex states are also the best states to describe the transition from quantum to classical . despite being fully quantum",
    ", they thus encode de facto classicality properties and insensitivity to openness of the system .",
    "therefore , they provide the best playground to understand the mechanisms of irreversibility , decoherence and dissipation in high magnetic fields .",
    "we will comment on this point in more detail later , in sec .",

    "@xcite the line shape has been modeled by a convolution of lorentzians and gaussians to include extrinsic origins of broadening induced by temperature and instrumental resolution . on theoretical grounds ,",
    "thermal broadening implies exponential line shapes ( in between lorentzians and gaussians ) , while intrinsic wave function broadening of drift states ( for non - vanishing local potential gradients ) leads to gaussian - type energy decay .",

    "in this paper , we have extended to the graphene case a greens - function formalism well suited to study the mechanism of lifting of the landau - level degeneracy by a smooth potential landscape at high magnetic fields , which was originally developed for the two - dimensional electron gases .",
    "the whole formalism relies on the use of a particular representation of semicoherent states , which are eigenstates of the kinetic part of the hamiltonian .",
    "these so - called vortex states in the 2deg case , or graphene vortex states in the graphene case , are both characterized by an integer topological quantum number @xmath1 , related to the vortex circulation and giving rise to the landau quantization of the orbital motion , and by a doubly continuous quantum number @xmath33 , corresponding to the location of the vortexlike phase singularities of the electronic wave function and characterizing the huge degeneracy of the landau levels in the absence of disorder .",
    "the coherent states character with respect to the degeneracy quantum number @xmath33 allows one to project the electron dynamics onto this overcomplete representation of states , which rigorously extends to quantum mechanics the classical guiding - center picture .    in a first stage , we have derived the exact matrix elements for smooth arbitrary scalar and mass potentials , as well as for off - diagonal smooth potentials related to ripples in graphene .",
    "the particular form of these matrix elements has revealed the different processes leading to landau - level mixing and coupling between electron and hole bands .",
    "we have shown that at high magnetic field , when the landau - level mixing can be safely neglected , a mixing between the hole and electron energy bands is unavoidably induced by second - order derivatives of the scalar potential , independently of the presence or not of a mass potential .",
    "we have been able to derive in this high magnetic field regime exact expressions for the electronic green s function in the presence either of an arbitrary quadratic scalar potential or an arbitrary quadratic mass potential .    besides affording the derivation of unique green s function solutions valid for closed and open quadratic potentials which underline the dual correspondence between quantization effects and tunneling effects ,",
    "we have emphasized that the semicoherent vortex representation offers a quasilocal perspective of the quantization process closely related to the deformation view of the classical phase - space mechanics , a property which turns out to be essential to capture the transition from the nonlocal quantum world to the local classical world .",
    "furthermore , the vortex representation has revealed a hierarchy of local energy scales formed by the successive derivatives of the potential and thus ordered by their degree of nonlocality . as a result ,",
    "quantum features associated with the lowest derivatives of the potential appear to be the most robust against the inelastic effects .",
    "we have emphasized that the consideration of a finite temperature allows one to disregard the smallest inaccessible energy scales and thus to devise successive approximation schemes for an arbitrary smooth potential .    within this spirit ,",
    "we have derived controlled analytical expressions for the local density of states in graphene valid at high magnetic field in the presence of smooth arbitrary scalar and mass potentials within different temperature regimes . we have identified the most relevant mechanism of intrinsic broadening of the ldos peaks and have shown that a lot of information on the different potentials at play in graphene can be extracted from the experimental ldos spectra performed at high magnetic field .",

    "<S> we study theoretically the energy and spatially resolved local density of states ( ldos ) in graphene at high perpendicular magnetic field . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> we extend from the schrdinger to the dirac case a semicoherent - state greens - function formalism , devised to obtain in a quantitative way the lifting of the landau - level degeneracy in the presence of smooth confinement and smooth disordered potentials . our general technique , which rigorously describes quantum - mechanical motion in a magnetic field beyond the semi - classical guiding center picture of vanishing magnetic length ( both for the ordinary two - dimensional electron gas and graphene ) , is connected to the deformation ( weyl ) quantization theory in phase space developed in mathematical physics . for generic quadratic potentials of either scalar ( i.e. , electrostatic ) or mass ( i.e. , associated with coupling to the substrate ) types , we exactly solve the regime of large magnetic field ( yet at finite magnetic length - formally , this amounts to considering an infinite fermi velocity ) where landau - level mixing becomes negligible . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we obtain a closed - form expression for the graphene green s function in this regime , providing analytically the discrete energy spectra for both cases of scalar and mass parabolic confinement . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the coherent - state representation is shown to display a hierarchy of local energy scales ordered by powers of the magnetic length and successive spatial derivatives of the local potential , which allows one to devise controlled approximation schemes at finite temperature for _ arbitrary _ and possibly disordered potential landscapes . as an application </S>",
    "<S> , we derive general analytical non - perturbative expressions for the ldos , which may serve as a good starting point for interpreting experimental studies . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we are able to account for many puzzling features of the ldos recently observed by high magnetic field scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments on graphene , such as a roughly @xmath0-increase in the @xmath1th landau - level linewidth in the ldos peaks at low temperatures , together with a flattening of the spatial variations in the landau - level effective energies at increasing @xmath1 . </S>"
