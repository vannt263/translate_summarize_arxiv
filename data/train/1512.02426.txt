    "casimir and casimir  polder forces ( cp ) are electromagnetic interactions between neutral macroscopic bodies and/or molecules due to the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "the presence of perfect boundaries ( perfect conductors ) modifies the possible wavelength of vacuum fluctuations and leads to observable effects like the lifetime and frequency shift of an atom in an excited state @xcite , the interatomic potential between two atoms @xcite , the anomalous gyromagnetic ratio @xcite , which are all different from the vacuum case .",
    "the interaction between a ground - state molecule and a perfect electric mirror is always attractive while the interaction between an excited molecule and an perfect electric mirror shows an oscillating distance - dependence .",
    "this has been confirmed in measurements of the force between an excited ion and a metallic mirror @xcite .",
    "recently , the attention in the literature has been directed towards chiral molecules which posses distinctive optical properties including optical rotation as well as circular dichroism .",
    "chiral molecules are molecules without point or plane symmetry ; the two distinct mirror images of a chiral molecule are called enantiomers . many of the processes crucial to life involve chiral molecules whose chiral identity plays a central role in their chemical reactions , the wrong enantiomer reacts in a different way and does not produce the required result .",
    "spectroscopically , enantiomers have identical properties and distinguishing between them is a non - trivial task when using normal spectroscopy .",
    "a frequently used method to separate enantiomers in an industrial setting is chiral chromotography @xcite .",
    "recently , several laser schemes have been proposed to separate mixtures of enantiomers , and the effect of molecular rotation on enantioseparation has been studied @xcite .",
    "furthermore casimir  polder forces between chiral molecules in absorptive and dispersive chiral medium have shown discriminatory effects , which might be used to separate enantiomers @xcite .    in this article , we consider the dynamical casimir ",
    "polder interaction between a chiral molecule and a metal or dielectric body at finite temperature using a dynamical approach , with the molecule exhibiting electric , magnetic and chiral polarizabilities .",
    "the dynamical cp force between an enantiomer and a perfect chiral mirror is a possible system for distinguishing and separating enantiomers , because the dispersion energy between these systems depends on the relative handedness of the molecule with respect to that of the molecules constituting the chiral mirror .",
    "therefore , enantiomers that pass at low speeds near the chiral mirror will be attracted or repelled in opposite directions and will be separated based on their chirality .",
    "we assume to switch on the interaction between the molecule and the field at a particular time and study the resulting time evolution of the casimir ",
    "polder interaction . even if the interaction with the free field is always present ,",
    "our assumption to switch on suddenly the interaction with the body - assisted field at @xmath0 can be a good approximation of the more realistic cases of a rapid change of some parameter characterizing the strength of the atom - field interaction or of putting the atom at some distance from the macroscopic body , obtaining a partially dressed atom or molecule @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the force could be observed in principle on time - scales of femto - seconds for typical molecules and nano - seconds for rydberg atoms .",
    "the dynamical self - dressing has been considered for an electric ground - state atom near an electric perfect conductor @xcite , or for a partially dressed atomic state @xcite .",
    "also , the dynamical cp interaction between a neutral atom and a real surface has been recently investigated @xcite .",
    "the cp force of a chiral molecule near a body has so far been considered only in the static case @xcite . in this paper , we consider the dynamical self - dressing for a chiral molecule near a body ; our approach includes finite temperature , arbitrary geometries of the body and arbitrary internal molecular states . as a simple application",
    ", we consider the cp interaction between an initially bare ground - state chiral molecule and a perfect chiral plate at zero temperature .",
    "we will show that the casimir ",
    "polder interaction at large times can be attractive or repulsive depending on the chiralities of the molecule and the medium .",
    "this differs from the stationary cp interaction between an electric molecule and an electric perfect plate , which is always attractive @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the time - dependent approach allows us to follow the temporal evolution of the cp force due to the initial conditions .",

    "it is easy to show that @xmath109 for @xmath110 ; this is due to the fact that we switch on the interaction at the initial time @xmath0 .    for subsequent times , the force increases exhibiting an oscillatory behaviour in time .",
    "depending on the time , the force can be attractive and repulsive for a given distance , contrary to the static case where it has a definite sign .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we display the chiral cp force at fixed distance from the mirror before the back - reaction time .     and @xmath111 .",
    "]     + for large times , the force converges to the static force ; this corresponds to a totally dressed molecule .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the dynamics of the chiral force after the backreaction .     and @xmath112 .",
    "]    to interpret our results , recall that the cp force is due to the exchange of one virtual photon between the molecule and the mirror .",
    "different expressions for the force are needed before and after the backreaction time because the photon needs a finite time in order to be reflected and absorbed by the molecule .",
    "note that the force is non - vanishing even before the backreaction time , because the molecule interacts with the field modes which incorporate the presence of the conducting wall and hence instantaneously feels the presence of the mirror .",
    "this is because we are evaluating the force on the atom , which responds to the local field at its position and thus it is immediately influenced by a change of the atom s physical parameters .",
    "we expect that , if the force on the conducting wall were evaluated , it would be influenced by a change of the atomic parameters ( or by a sudden switching on of the atom - field interaction ) only after the causality time @xmath113 .",
    "the force is divergent on the light cone @xmath103 , because in the frequency - integral we include arbitrarily large frequencies : this divergence is not surprising , being due to the assumption of a point - like molecule ( dipole approximation ) and to the idealised nature of the material .",
    "a real material is transparent for large frequencies , providing a natural cut - off to regularize the integral ; moreover , also the inclusion of a finite size of the atom / molecule would provide a natural ultraviolet cutoff given by the appropriate atomic form factor .",
    "using a dynamical approach , we have obtained the electric , magnetic and the chiral parts of the time - dependent casimir  polder interaction between an initially bare chiral molecule and a body at finite temperature , the molecule initially being prepared in a generic internal state .",
    "the force depends on time because the populations of the excited states of the molecule depend on time ( population - induced dynamics ) , but also because of the initial boundary condition ( self - dressing induced dynamics ) .    as an example we have considered the particular case of the interaction between an initially bare ground - state chiral molecule and perfectly reflecting chiral plate at zero temperature . here",
    ", the force is time - dependent only because of self - dressing .",
    "the dynamical cp can be attractive or repulsive depending on time , contrary to the static case where it has a definite sign for a given distance .",
    "the dynamical interaction is due to the exchange of one virtual photon between the chiral molecule and the mirror",
    ". a characteristic time scale of the dynamical cp force is the time taken by the virtual photon to be emitted by the molecule , reflected by the mirror , and reabsorbed by the molecule ( back - reaction time ) .",
    "the dynamical interaction oscillates in time and the scale of these oscillations is related to the molecular transition frequency . the dynamical effect we have considered could in principle be measured by switching on the interaction between the molecule and the field at the initial time @xmath0 .",
    "even if this is an idealized situation , it could be approximated by the more realistic case of a rapid change of some parameter characterizing the atom ",
    "field interaction ( strength and/or orientation of the atomic dipole moments , atomic transition frequency by stark shift , for example ) or putting the atom at some distance from the macroscopic body @xcite .",
    "another possibility to obtain a dynamical effect could be introducing the mirror at @xmath0 ; however , because in our formalism the presence of the mirror is included in the boundary conditions and not in the system s dynamics , this would require a different approach based on a transformation of field operators and modes relating old and new ones ( i.e. before and after switching on the mirror ) , similarly to the dynamical casimir effect .",
    "the use of chiral rydberg atoms , which have low transition frequencies and large polarizabilities , could be a simpler system to measure the dynamical casimir force , because in this case the dynamical force evolves on longer timescales @xcite ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "we have shown that the chiral casimir  polder interaction shows a discriminatory effect because it changes sign if the molecule is substituted by its enantiomer and the dynamical force can hence allow us to distinguish different enantiomers .",
    "we finally remark that in our approach the medium is considered macroscopically with the electromagnetic green tensor .",
    "our model can be generalized to different molecular internal states and different geometries in which the green s tensor is known .",
