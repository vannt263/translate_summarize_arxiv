    "the spatially flat , isotropic , @xmath0=0 model was recently investigated in detail in the setting of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite .",
    "that investigation introduced a conceptual framework and analytical and numerical tools to construct the _ physical sector _ of the quantum theory .",
    "these methods enabled one to systematically explore the effects of quantum geometry both on the gravitational and matter sectors and to extend previous results in lqc .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to use the ` improved dynamics ' of @xcite to carry out a similar analysis for the closed , @xmath0=1 model , coupled to a massless scalar field . in our presentation",
    ", we will skip those constructions , proofs and arguments which are direct analogs of the ones used in the @xmath0=0 case in @xcite",
    ". the focus will be on the differences from the existing treatments of the @xmath0=1 model and also our earlier analysis of the @xmath0=0 model .",
    "although current observations favor spatially flat models , the @xmath0=1 closed model is of considerable conceptual and technical interest . on the conceptual side ,",
    "an outstanding problem in quantum cosmology and indeed in full quantum gravity is whether one can construct a framework that cures the short - distance difficulties faced by the classical theory near singularities , while maintaining an agreement with it at large scales . by their very construction ,",
    "perturbative and effective descriptions have no problem with the second requirement .",
    "however , physically their implications can not be trusted at the planck scale and mathematically they generally fail to provide a deterministic evolution across the putative singularity . in loop quantum gravity ( lqg )",
    "the situation is just the opposite .",
    "quantum geometry gives rise to new discrete structures at the planck scale that modify the classical theory in such a way that , at least in simple models , space - like singularities of general relativity are resolved .",
    "however , since the emphasis is on background independence and non - perturbative methods , a priori it is not clear whether the theory also has a rich semi - classical sector . do the novel dynamical corrections unleashed by the underlying quantum geometry naturally fade away at macroscopic distances or do they have unforeseen implications that prevent the theory from reproducing general relativity at large scales ? while there is recent progress which indicates that lqg does admit a viable semi - classical sector near minkowski space - time @xcite , further evidence is needed in other contexts such as cosmological settings .",
    "the ` improved dynamics ' of @xcite successfully addressed this issue in the @xmath0=0 case .",
    "however , because classical recollapse , the @xmath0=1 model provides a more stringent tests . in particular using numerical evolutions of equations used in the early lqc works @xcite , green and unruh @xcite had concluded that there may be a key difficulty : the lqc evolution appeared not to reproduce the recollapse predicted by general relativity .",
    "since curvatures at the epoch of the classical recollapse are very small , this feature appeared to indicate that lqc would deviate from general relativity in perfectly ordinary situations .",
    "thus , although the lqc equations used in the green - unruh analysis did cure the ultraviolet difficulties by resolving the singularity in the sense of @xcite , they appeared not to have a viable infrared behavior .",
    "can this difficulty be resolved ? or ,",
    "does the situation in the @xmath0=1 model indicate that lqg may not admit a good semi - classical sector in this cosmological setting ?",
    "we will employ methods developed in the @xmath0=0 case @xcite to probe this issue in the _ physical sector _ of the quantum theory .",
    "a systematic analysis will show that not only is the big - bang singularity resolved but the quantum evolution in fact faithfully mirrors the predictions of general relativity , including the re - collapse , when the curvature is small compared to the planck scale .",
    "a second conceptual issue is whether the general features of the planck scale physics found in the @xmath0=0 case in @xcite are robust .",
    "for example , there the friedmann equation @xmath2 is replaced in lqc by the quantum corrected equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "the correction comes with a negative sign , making it possible for @xmath5 to vanish triggering a bounce when the matter density reaches a critical value , @xmath6 .",
    "one then has a pre - big - bang branch joined on to the current post - big - bang branch by a deterministic evolution , both behaving classically when the density is low compared to @xmath6 .",
    "does this feature survive in the @xmath0=1 case or does space - time simply become fuzzy near and to the ` past ' of the big - bang ?",
    "is there only one cycle in which the universe resembles our own ? is the value of the critical density @xmath7 at the bounce point essentially the same as in the @xmath0=0 model or does it depend on the spatial topology ?",
    "our analysis will show that the big - bang and the big - crunch are replaced by a quantum bounce leading , in a precise sense , to a cyclic quantum universe .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath7 is robust so long as the maximum radius of the universe attains a macroscopic size .    on the technical side",
    ", this model also provides a number of challenges . in lqg ,",
    "the configuration variable is a connection @xmath8 , related to the spin connection @xmath9 ( determined by the spatial triad ) and the extrinsic curvature @xmath10 via @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the barbero - immirzi parameter . however , because of certain technical difficulties with the methods used , so far the @xmath0=1 case has been treated in the literature by regarding the extrinsic curvature @xmath10 as a connection and constructing holonomies from it @xcite .",
    "because of gauge fixing this is a mathematically viable strategy .",
    "however as emphasized in , e.g. @xcite , to make closer contact with the full theory , it is desirable to construct the theory using connections @xmath8 .",
    "so an important question arises : can the improved dynamics of @xcite overcome the difficulties faced in the earlier treatments , allowing us to formulate the theory in terms of @xmath8 ?",
    "we will find that the answer is in the affirmative .",
    "a second technical challenge arises in the definition of the operator representing the field strength @xmath13 that features in the expression of the hamiltonian constraint . in lqc",
    ", this operator is constructed from holonomies @xcite . in the @xmath0=0 model",
    ", one can use the integral curves of the ( right and left - invariant ) fiducial triad @xmath14 to build the holonomy loops . in the @xmath0=1 case ,",
    "@xmath14 ( is only left invariant and ) satisfies the commutation relations of @xmath15 .",
    "hence none of the three pairs of triad vectors is surface forming .",
    "if one uses a general loop which is not tangential to these triads , holonomies ( fail to be almost periodic functions of connections and ) do not lead to well - defined operators in the quantum theory . thus , finding suitable loops poses an interesting technical challenge .",
    "we resolve this issue . finally , to numerically solve the quantum hamiltonian constraint , one has to find normalizable eigenfunctions of a certain difference operator @xmath16 .",
    "recall that in the case of , e.g. , a simple harmonic oscillator , the differential operator representing the hamiltonian admits an eigenfunction with any real number as its eigenvalue .",
    "normalizable eigenfunctions exist only for discrete eigenvalues and thus constitute a set of zero measure in the space of all eigenfunctions . in the @xmath0=1 case ,",
    "the situation is similar with the operator @xmath16 .",
    "however , now the normalizable eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues are not known analytically and , since they constitute a set of zero measure , one has to exercise considerable care in singling them out numerically .",
    "insights gained from the resolution of these conceptual and technical issues are likely to be important as one considers more and more general situations and develop new tools to tackle the hamiltonian constraint of full lqg .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we summarize the basics of the classical and quantum theories for our model , arriving at the form of the hamiltonian constraint operator . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we sketch the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) theory and in [ s4 ] we introduce the physical sector of the theory in lqc .",
    "numerical simulations are discussed in section [ s5 ] . in section [ s6 ]",
    "we summarize effective equations of the semi - classical sector , list the main numerical results and compare them with predictions of the effective theory .",
    "we also clarify some issues that have been raised by a numerical analysis by laguna @xcite and remove confusion caused by an unfortunate use of terminology there .",
    "section [ s7 ] places these results in a broader context and discusses their relation with that by green and unruh @xcite .",
    "appendix [ a1 ] summarizes some background material on the fiducial geometrical structures used in @xmath0=1 models with the so - called ` bianchi ix ' symmetries .",
    "this section is divided into two parts . in the first we summarize the classical theory and in the second we present the basics of the quantum theory .",
    "space - time manifolds under consideration are of the form @xmath17 , where @xmath18 has the topology of a 3-sphere , @xmath19 . as explained in appendix [ a1 ] , one can identify @xmath18 with the symmetry group @xmath20 ( which ensures spatial homogeneity and isotropy ) and endow it with a fixed fiducial basis of 1-forms @xmath21 and vectors @xmath14 . the resulting fiducial",
    "metric is _",

    "this fiducial metric @xmath22 is @xmath25 and the scalar curvature is @xmath26 .",
    "we shall set @xmath27 .",
    "( for details , see appendix [ a1 ] ) .    to facilitate comparison with the spatially flat , @xmath0=0 case and to directly use results of @xcite obtained in that case , we will set our conventions in a parallel fashion .",
    "the dynamical , isotropic homogeneous connections and triads will be parameterized by @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively : [ ps ] a_a^i = c ^-1 _ a^i , e^a_i = p ^-2 ^a_i . as in the @xmath0=0 case",
    "@xmath28 is dimensionless while @xmath29 has dimensions of area and the density weight of @xmath30 is absorbed in the determinant of the fiducial metric . at the point @xmath31 of the phase space , the physical 3-metric @xmath32 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath33",
    "are given by : q_ab = |p| ^-2 _ abk_ab = ( c- ) |p|^ ^-2 _ ab the corresponding physical volume of @xmath18 is @xmath34 .",
    "the scale factor @xmath35 associated with a physical metric @xmath32 is generally expressed via @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the _ unit _ 3-sphere metric .",
    "then , the scale factor is related to @xmath29 via @xmath38 . as usual @xmath29",
    "can take both positive and negative values , the change in sign corresponds to a flip in the orientation of the triads @xmath14 which leaves the physical metric @xmath32 invariant .",
    "expressions of the total action , the symplectic structure , and the hamiltonian constraint require an integration over @xmath18 . in the @xmath0=0 case",
    "the underlying manifold is non - compact ( @xmath39 ) , whence the naive integrals would simply diverge .",
    "therefore , irrespective of which quantization scheme one uses , one has to fix a fiducial cell with finite volume , say @xmath40 ( w.r.t . the fiducial flat metric ) , and restrict all integrations to this cell . in the @xmath0=1 case",
    ", @xmath18 is compact and the introduction of a cell is unnecessary . nonetheless , in many of the key equations our @xmath41 plays the role of the volume @xmath40 of the cell in the @xmath0=0 case .",
    "in both cases , the fundamental poisson bracket is : [ pb ] \\{c , p } = 8g3 where @xmath42 is the barbero - immirzi parameter . finally , using the fact that the cartan orthonormal triad @xmath43 on a 3-sphere _ of radius @xmath44 _ satisfies the identity [ cartan ] ^k + _",
    "ij^k ^i^j = 0 , it is straightforward to calculate the field strength @xmath45 of the connection @xmath8 on @xmath18 [ f1 ] f_ab^k = ^-2 _ ij^k _ a^j _ b^k .",
    "our fiducial co - triad @xmath21 corresponds to @xmath23 .",
    "but we have refrained from using this numerical value in ( [ f1 ] ) to clarify the relation with the @xmath0=0 case . to pass to this case , one has to set @xmath41 equal to the volume @xmath40 of the fiducial cell there but take the limit as @xmath44 goes to infinity . in this limit ,",
    "the fiducial co - triad @xmath21 goes to the ( flat ) fiducial co - triad used in the @xmath0=0 case ( see ( [ cartan ] ) ) and the field strength @xmath45 goes over to its value @xmath46 in the @xmath0=0 case @xcite .    as in the @xmath0=0 models",
    ", we have completely gauge fixed the gauss and the diffeomorphism constraints by fixing @xmath21 and @xmath14 and using the parametrization ( [ ps ] ) of the phase space variables @xmath47 .",
    "so , we are left only with the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the gravitational part of this constraint is given by @xcite : [ ham1 ] c _ = _ m ^3 x , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the extrinsic curvature , and where , as is usual in mini - superspace analysis , we have set the lapse equal to @xmath50 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath8 is related to the spin - connection @xmath9 ( of the physical triad @xmath51 ) and the extrinsic curvature @xmath10 through @xmath52 , it is convenient to express the second term in the integrand of ( [ ham1 ] ) in terms of the curvature @xmath45 of @xmath8 and the curvature @xmath53 of @xmath9 : e^aie^bj k_[a^i k_b]^j = 12 ^ 2 ^ij_k e^aie^bj ( f_ab^k - _ ab^k ) .in the @xmath0=0 case , the spatial curvature @xmath53 vanishes and the extrinsic curvature term in ( [ ham1 ] ) reduces to a multiple of the first term involving @xmath45 . in full general relativity , by contrast , while @xmath54 is determined by the momenta @xmath30 , its expression is rather complicated and this strategy of handling the extrinsic curvature terms , by itself , does not simplify matters .",
    "the situation in general homogeneous models @xcite as well as black hole interiors @xcite is in between the two : although @xmath53 is non - zero , its expression is simple and manageable . in the @xmath0=1 model now under consideration one has : _ ab^k = - 14 _ ij^k _ a^i _ b^j .",
    "therefore , the gravitational part of the constraint reduces to : c _ & = & -1 ^ 2 _ m ^3 x ^ij_k e^-1 e^a_ie^b_j [ ham2 ] + & = & - 6 ^ 2 where , in the last step we have used the expression ( [ f1 ] ) of @xmath55 . in the @xmath0=1 case now under consideration , @xmath23 .",
    "however , as indicated above , we did not substitute this numerical value because results for the @xmath0=0 case @xcite can be recovered by setting @xmath56 ( and @xmath57 ) .",
    "however , since @xmath44 always occurs in the combination @xmath58 in the hamiltonian constraint , we can set @xmath23 throughout and recover the @xmath0=0 results simply by setting @xmath59 . in what follows",
    ", we will adopt this strategy .",
    "* remark : * in the above construction , we began with a fiducial triad @xmath14 and a co - triad @xmath21 adapted to a 3-sphere of radius @xmath44=2 .",
    "therefore , our construction may appear to be tied to that choice .",
    "had we used a 3-sphere of radius @xmath60 , the fiducial triad and the co - triad we have rescaled via @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "it is easy to check that the variables @xmath63 parameterizing the physical fields @xmath64 are left unchanged .",

    "as discussed in detail in @xcite , this is a manifestation of the quantum nature of geometry , i.e. , a reflection of the fact that the area operator has purely discrete spectrum . as in @xcite",
    "our strategy is to shrink the loop only until its _ physical _ area equals the ` area gap ' @xmath97 , i.e. , the minimal non - zero eigenvalue of the area operator .",
    "now , in the @xmath0=0 case , the edges of @xmath94 can be taken to be the integral curves of the triad vector fields @xmath14 and @xmath96 . in the @xmath0=1 model , however , the @xmath14 satisfy the commutation relations of @xmath81 ; they do not commute .",
    "therefore their integral curves can not provide the desired closed loop @xmath94 . in the existing literature ,",
    "a closed loop is formed by simply adding a fifth edge @xcite .",
    "however , this strategy is not viable : since the five edges do not span an unambiguous 2-surface , the notion of the area enclosed by the loop has no obvious meaning .",
    "however , note that while @xmath14 are the ` left - invariant ' vector fields , @xmath18 also admits three ` right invariant ' vector fields @xmath98 ( see appendix [ a1 ] ) .",
    "these are the symmetry fields : they also satisfy the commutation relations of @xmath81 , act simply and transitively on @xmath18 and their action leaves each of our fiducial triads @xmath14 and co - triads @xmath21 invariant . since they commute with @xmath14 , one can form the desired closed loops @xmath94 by first moving from @xmath95 along the integral curve of say @xmath99 then @xmath100 then along @xmath101 and then along @xmath102 ( where @xmath100 is chosen to coincide with @xmath103 at @xmath95 ) .",
    "an explicit realization of this procedure is presented in appendix [ a1 ] and a more geometric construction appears in @xcite .",
    "the final field strength operator does not depend on whether the first segment is chosen to be left invariant or right invariant and is given by representation .",

    "the fact that @xmath104 is a function of @xmath29 rather than a constant arises from the requirement that the _ physical _ area of @xmath94 be set equal to @xmath97 . as explained in @xcite , this strategy mimics the full theory in a well - defined sense and the resulting ` improved dynamics ' is free of the drawbacks of older hamiltonian constraint of lqc .",
    "as in @xcite , the viewpoint is that at the fundamental level i.e . at the planck scale the field strength operator is non - local and the usual local classical expression arises only on coarse graining in semi - classical states .    to obtain the explicit action of @xmath92 on @xmath65 , one has to face two complications",
    "the first arises already in the @xmath0=0 case .",
    "the operator @xmath92 for @xmath0=0 can be recovered by setting @xmath59 .",
    "it depends on the connection only through @xmath105 .",
    "since @xmath104 is itself a function of @xmath89 , the action of @xmath106 on @xmath65 is rather subtle . as discussed in detail in @xcite , it is simplest to express it by going to a basis @xmath107 which is better adapted to the volume operator @xmath108 : [ v ] @xmath109 = ( 86)^32 |v|k^3 @xmath109 where the dimensionless label @xmath110 the eigenvalue of @xmath108 apart from a constant is related to the dimensionless label @xmath68 the eigenvalue of @xmath89 apart from an overall constant via [ v ] v = k sgn ( ) ||^32 , k = 23 . in this basis , @xmath111 are simply the translation operators : [ mbop2 ] e^i c2 ( v ) = ( v+1 ) , so that [ sine ] ( c ) ( v ) = 12i ( ( v+2 ) - ( v-2 ) ) . in the @xmath0=1 case",
    "we have an added complication : ( [ f2 ] ) contains @xmath112 rather than @xmath113 .",
    "this difference can be handled as follows : on @xmath65 [ shift](c - 2 ) ( v ) = e^if c e^-if ( v ) , f = sgn v4 |vk|^23 .",
    "note that since @xmath114 is continuous everywhere ( including the point @xmath115 ) , the operator @xmath116 is well - defined and unitary on all of @xmath65 .",

    "there are two main subtleties in the passage from spatially flat , @xmath0=0 models to the closed , @xmath0=1 ones .",
    "first , the loop around which holonomy is computed has to be constructed using both right and left invariant vector fields .",
    "second , now the connection dependence is in the operator @xmath112 rather than @xmath106 and one has to define its action on @xmath65 using the unitary operators @xmath117 .",
    "when this is done , the gravitational part of the hamiltonian constraint is symmetric and positive , given by ( [ ham4 ] ) .",
    "finally , to write the complete constraint operator we also need the matter part of the constraint . for the massless scalar field , in the classical theory",
    "it is given by : c_matt = 8 g |p|^-32 p_^2 as usual , the non - trivial part in the passage to quantum theory is the function @xmath118 .",
    "however , as with the co - triad operator ( [ cotriad ] ) , we can use the method introduced by thiemann in the full theory @xcite .",
    "this issue is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the final result is : [ inversevol ] ( v ) = ( 68 ^2)^3/2 b(v ) ( v ) where [ b ] b(v ) = ( 32)^3 k |v| | |v + 1|^1/3 - |v - 1|^1/3 |^3 .",
    "it is self - adjoint on @xmath65 and diagonal in the eigenstates of the volume operator .    collecting these results",
    "we can express the total constraint [ hc1 ] ( v ) = ( _ grav + _ matt ) ( v ) = 0 , as follows : [ hc2 ] ^2_(v , ) = & - & ( v , ) + = & - & _ o ( v , ) + g2 [ b(v)]^-1 ( v , ) .here , @xmath119 is the operator that appears in the @xmath0=0 quantum constraint in place of @xmath16 @xcite : [ hc3 ] _ o ( v , ) = - [ b(v)]^-1 ( c^+(v ) ( v+4 , ) + c^o(v ) ( v , ) + c^-(v ) ( v-4 , ) ) where the coefficients @xmath120 and @xmath121 are given by : [ c ] c^+(v ) & = & 3k g8 |v + 2| | |v + 1| - |v + 3| | + c^-(v ) & = & c^+(v - 4 ) + c^o(v ) & = & - c^+(v ) - c^-(v )  .",
    "thus , the @xmath0=1 quantum constraint has the same form as in the @xmath0=0 case . as one would expect from the classical expression ( [ ham2 ] ) , the difference @xmath122 is diagonal in the @xmath110-representation and vanishes when we set @xmath59 .    in the remainder of the paper",
    ", we will work with the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hc2 ] ) .",
    "as in the @xmath0=0 case @xcite , the form of this constraint is similar to that of a massless klein - gordon field in a static space - time , but now with an additional static potential .",
    "@xmath123 is the analog of the static time coordinate and the difference operator @xmath16 , of the spatial laplace - type operator plus the static potential .",
    "hence , the scalar field @xmath123 can again be used as ` emergent time ' in the quantum theory .",
    "we will examine the operator @xmath16 in some detail in sections [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] .",
    "finally , in the above construction we made a factor ordering choice the motivations behind which are the same as those discussed in @xcite .",
    "this choice will facilitate comparison between the lqc results in the @xmath0=1 and @xmath0=0 cases and yield the equation with its ` natural ' factor ordering in the ` continuum limit ' .",

    "this is just what one would hope during the epoch in which the universe is large .",

    "( see figs .",
    "[ fig : wdw1]a and [ fig : wdw1]b . ) in this sense , the evolution does not resolve the classical singularity .",
    "we will show in the next three sections that the situation is very different in lqc .",
    "this can occur because the equation is a good approximation to the discrete equation only for large @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in @xcite , the approximation is not uniform but depends on the state : in arriving at the equation from lqc we had to neglect @xmath185 dependent terms of the form @xmath194 for @xmath195 . for semi - classical states considered above ,",
    "this implies that the approximation is excellent for @xmath196 but becomes inadequate when the peak of the wave function lies at a value of @xmath110 comparable to @xmath197 .",
    "then , the lqc evolution departs sharply from the evolution .",
    "we will find that , rather than following the classical trajectory into the big bang singularity , the peak of the lqc wave function now exhibits a bounce . since large values of @xmath197 are classically preferred , the value of @xmath110 at the bounce can be quite large .",
    "however , as in the @xmath198 models @xcite , we will find that the matter density at the bounce point is comparable to the planck density , independently of the precise value of @xmath197 so long as @xmath172 .",
    "since generic solutions in the closed , @xmath0=1 cosmologies undergo a recollapse in classical general relativity , the scale factor can not serve as a global time variable .",
    "this fact has been used as a criticism of the implicit use of the scale factor as time in the older lqc literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . however ,",
    "if matter sources _ include _ a massless scalar field @xmath123 , that field _ is _ monotonic and single valued in all classical solutions .",
    "therefore it can be chosen as the ` internal ' time variable with respect to which the scale factor and other fields evolve . furthermore , as discussed in section [ s2 ] , for the model considered in this paper the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hc2 ] ) of lqc has the same form as the wave equation in a static space - time , with @xmath123 playing the role of time and @xmath16 of the elliptic spatial operator plus a static potential .",
    "therefore as in the @xmath0=0 case @xmath123 can be regarded as _ emergent time _ also in the quantum theory .",
    "this choice is free of the criticisms mentioned above . in this section",
    "we will construct the physical sector of lqc by exploiting this fact . as mentioned in section [ s1 ]",
    ", we will find that quantum geometry effects resolve both the big bang and the big crunch singularities , leading to a cyclic quantum universe .",
    "still the scalar field will continue to be a viable emergent time _",
    "globally_.      as in the spatially flat @xmath0=0 case , our kinematical hilbert space will be : @xmath199 . since @xmath123 is to be thought of as ` time ' and @xmath110 as the genuine , physical degree of freedom which evolves with respect to this ` time ' , we have chosen the standard schrdinger representation for @xmath123 but the ` polymer representation ' for @xmath110 to correctly incorporate the quantum geometry effects .",
    "this is a conservative approach in that the results will directly reveal the manifestations of quantum geometry .",
    "had we chosen a non - standard representation for the scalar field , these effects would have been mixed with those arising from an unusual representation of ` time evolution ' and , furthermore , comparison with the theory would have become more complicated .    the form of the lqc hamiltonian constraint ( [ hc2 ] ) is the same as that of the constraint ( [ wdw1 ] ) .",
    "properties of @xmath119 analyzed in @xcite immediately imply that @xmath16 is again a positive , symmetric operator on @xmath200 , whence it admits a self - adjoint ( friedrich ) extension .",
    "( for precise domains , see @xcite . )",
    "the main difference is that while the @xmath201 is a differential operator , the lqc @xmath16 is a _ difference _ operator .",
    "this gives rise to certain technically important distinctions .",
    "for , now the space of physical states i.e .",
    "of appropriate solutions to the constraint equation is naturally divided into sectors each of which is preserved by the ` evolution ' and by the action of our dirac observables .",

    "let @xmath208 and @xmath209 denote the subspaces of @xmath210 with states whose support is restricted to lattices @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "each of these three subspaces is mapped to itself by @xmath16 which is self - adjoint and positive definite on all three hilbert spaces .",

    "thus , we are primarily interested in the symmetric subspace of @xmath213 ; the other two hilbert spaces will be useful only in the intermediate stages of our discussion .",
    "our first task is to explore properties of the operator @xmath16 .",

    "since this equation has the form of a second order recursion relation , as in the @xmath0=0 case one might expect a 2-fold degeneracy .",
    "however , there is an important subtlety .",
    "let us consider the asymptotic regime @xmath217 .",
    "then , each @xmath218 approaches a solution to the equation and as we saw in section [ s3.1 ] there is only one linearly independent solution which does not diverge for large @xmath110 .",
    "the form of the inner product on @xmath213 now implies that , as in the theory , the degeneracy is removed ; only one of the two linearly independent solutions can belong to the spectral family of @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , numerical calculations show that this solution , which decays exponentially for @xmath217 , will in general diverge in the other asymptotic limit @xmath219 .",
    "it is only for some _ discrete _ values @xmath220 of @xmath156 that one obtains solutions which do not diverge in either asymptotic limits .",
    "( this phenomenon was already noted in @xcite in a simpler model without a scalar field but with a negative cosmological constant . ) since these solutions decay exponentially in both limits , they are normalizable in @xmath221 .",
    "thus , in contrast to the @xmath0=0 case , on each superselected sector , the spectrum of @xmath16 is _ discrete and each of its eigenvalues is non - degenerate_. goes to zero and thus fail to be normalizable in the hilbert space @xmath222 . because of the discreteness of lattices @xmath223 , nothing special happens ` near ' @xmath115 in lqc . ]",
    "we will denote the normalized eigenfunctions in @xmath224 by @xmath225 : e_n(v)= _",

    "therefore , e^(s)_n = 1 ( e_n(v ) + e_n(-v ) ) , also has eigenvalue @xmath231 , but belongs to @xmath213 .",

    "interestingly , the exact quantum dynamics provides a hamiltonian flow on the symplectic manifold @xmath387 ( the corresponding hamiltonian being just the expectation value function of the quantum hamiltonian operator ) . to obtain the desired , first order quantum corrections ,",
    "one finds a cross - section of @xmath387 i.e .",

    "this approximate quantum hamiltonian flow unambiguously projects down to @xmath388 and provides the desired corrections to classical equations of motion . in a certain sense",
    "this procedure encapsulates the more familiar ` effective action ' calculations in the hamiltonian framework @xcite . in lqc",
    ", these quantum corrections have been obtained for various matter sources @xcite , where judiciously chosen generalized coherent states are used to define the required embedding of @xmath388 into @xmath387 . just as the standard effective action refers to the in and out vacuum states , the final effective hamiltonian ( and thus the friedmann and raychaudhuri equations )",
    "depend on the specific choice of coherent states . however , the first order corrections we are interested in are insensitive to these details . in our case ,",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian is : [ heff0 ] h_:= c_eff16 g = a(v)16 g + ( 8 ^ 26)^- b(v ) p_^22  . where @xmath392 denotes eigenvalues ( [ a ] ) of @xmath393 .",
    "since the friedmann equations involve @xmath394 , to obtain modifications , we first derive the hamilton s equations of motion : [ dotv ] v & = & \\{v , h _ } = - 8 g3 c vp + & = & - a(v)2 ( 8 ^26)^-1 k^2/3 |v|^1/3 and [ dotphi ] = \\{,h _ } = ( 8 ^26)^-3/2 b(v ) p _  . using the constraint equation @xmath395 ,",

    "numerical simulations showed that our notion of ` semi - classicality at late times ' is surprisingly weak .",

    "since @xmath424 scales as @xmath425 and @xmath416 as @xmath426 , effective equations imply that both approximations improve as @xmath397 increases and become almost exact for universes which grow to interesting macroscopic sizes .    in particular ,",
    "as one would hope , the effective theory accurately reproduces the predictions of classical general relativity in the low curvature regime . yet , already",
    "the leading order correction from quantum geometry is strong enough to resolve singularities and replace them with a bounce .",
    "it is also noteworthy that for universes which grow to large macroscopic sizes , the density at the quantum bounce is universal , and equals that in the @xmath0=0 models .",

    "the effective theory provides a physical understanding of how they come about .",

    "certain effective equations have been written down and used to predict non - singular bounces @xcite in the broad framework of lqc .",
    "the presence of these bounces was also used to study the onset of a successful period of inflation in closed models @xcite .",
    "how do these analysis compare with that presented in this paper ?",
    "there are two important differences .",
    "first , these works focused on the matter part of the hamiltonian constraint and made a crucial use of quantum corrections to the matter hamiltonian arising from the use of representations ( of @xmath20-holonomies ) labeled by large values of @xmath456 .",
    "second , these large @xmath456 representations were used only in the matter part of the hamiltonian and not in the gravitational part . since then perez @xcite has shown that mathematical consistency requires us to use the @xmath457 representation in 3-dimensional gravity .",
    "he also argues that the same should hold in 4 dimensions . in any case , while the use of , say @xmath458 representation could be justified because the model has no spinor fields , the use of large @xmath456 values appears to be unnatural and needs an independent justification which is still lacking .",
    "similarly , without an independent justification , an asymmetric treatment of the gravitational and matter appears to be ad - hoc @xcite , somewhat similar to using two different metrics on the right and left hand side of classical einstein s equations .",
    "our analysis used the fundamental , @xmath457 representation for geometry as well as matter .",
    "our numerical simulations as well as effective equations show that with this choice the modifications of the matter hamiltonian play no role .",
    "this is consistent with findings in the older literature ; indeed this is the reason why large @xmath456 values were used there . in our analysis , it is the modification of the gravitational part of the hamiltonian constraint that plays a key role in the singularity resolution . in the older literature , by contrast , these modifications were ignored .",
    "nonetheless , basic physical ideas in these older works are intriguing and it would be interesting to reanalyze those issues using the hamiltonian constraint introduced in this paper",
    ".    we will conclude this section by clarifying two issues that have arisen from a recent work @xcite addressed to computational physicists , particularly numerical relativists .",
    "although this discussion refers only to the @xmath0=0 model considered in @xcite , it is included here because the same issues can arise in the @xmath0=1 model .",
    "the phrase `` these bounces can be understood as spurious reflections '' in the abstract ( and again in the body ) of @xcite was interpreted by some as suggesting that the bounces reported in @xcite were artifacts of bad numerics .",
    "this is certainly _ not _ the case : not only were those simulations performed with all the due care but our result that the lqc equations predict a genuine , physical bounce was in fact reproduced in the first half of @xcite .",
    "indeed , this part is a nice summary of our numerical results geared to computational physicists . from discussions with the author we understand that the intent of that phrase was to say :",
    "` had the physical problem been to solve a wave equation in the _ continuum _ and had one used non - uniform grids , one would also have found bounces which , from the perspective of continuum physics of this hypothetical problem , would be interpreted as spurious reflections in finite difference discretizations ' .",
    "this is likely to be an illuminating point for computational physicists but is not physically relevant in lqc where the basic equation is a difference equation .",
    "the second part of the paper considers a modification of the quantum hamiltonian constraint by `` adding ad - hoc higher order terms . ''",
    "it is then suggested that such modifications could remove the bounce .",
    "let us analyze the issue from a mathematical perspective even though the analysis and conclusions have no obvious physical significance since the modifications do not result from any systematic , physical considerations .",
    "then , since the physical state is symmetric under orientation reversal , simulations reported in @xcite imply that the bounce would _ not _ disappear but change its character . in the _ physical _ solution there",
    "would again be a pre - big - bang , contracting branch which would be joined in a deterministic fashion to a post - big - bang expanding branch .",
    "however , now the two branches will meet at @xmath115 .",
    "although the ensuing differences are not trivial , the qualitative picture is not changed even by these ad - hoc modifications .. ]",
    "key features of the @xmath0=1 model can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\i ) the scalar field @xmath123 serves as emergent time at all three levels : classical general relativity , theory and lqc . in the classical theory ,",
    "every solution undergoes a recollapse but @xmath123 remains single valued .",
    "each solution begins with a big bang and ends with a big crunch and @xmath123 ranges over the entire real line irrespective of the constant of motion @xmath397 . in the theory and",
    "lqc the form of the hamiltonian constraint operator implies that @xmath123 can serve as emergent time also in the quantum theory .",
    "situation with the range of @xmath123 in the theory is the same as that in classical general relativity since the singularities are not resolved , i.e. , since quantum dynamics can not unambiguously evolve the state across these singularities . in lqc on the other hand the singularities _ are _ resolved and the quantum evolution across the putative classical singularities is deterministic .",
    "the range of @xmath123 continues to be the entire real line .",
    "\\ii ) in lqc , three sets of results show that the big bang and the big - crunch singularities are both resolved .",
    "first , the lqc effective equations do not break down .",
    "rather , while the classical friedmann equation has only one root at which @xmath459 vanishes , quantum corrections introduce a second root when the matter density enters the planck regime , altering classical dynamics and giving rise to bounces .",
    "the second result refers to full quantum dynamics : in contrast to the theory , in lqc _ every _ state in @xmath460 has a well - defined unitary evolution for the full range @xmath461 of the ` emergent time ' @xmath123 .",
    "the third set of results is more detailed .",
    "it again involves the full dynamics of lqc but only semi - classical states in @xmath460 .",
    "consider a classical trajectory in the @xmath110-@xmath123 plane in which the universe evolves to a macroscopic maximum size .",
    "the classical friedmann equation implies that the universe attains its maximum volume @xmath462 at the recollapse point and this value is related to the constant of motion @xmath397 via has the same physical dimensions as @xmath463 and the numerical value of @xmath463 is @xmath464 [ vmax ] v_max = ( 16g/3 ^2)^ p_^ 0.6 p_^ .hence , in the solution under consideration @xmath397 has to be large .",
    "consider a point on this classical trajectory at a late time when the volume is macroscopic and a semi - classical state in which dirac observables @xmath465 and @xmath466 are peaked at this point at ` time ' @xmath162 .",
    "when evolved , this quantum state remains semi - classical , sharply peaked at the classical solution under consideration during the entire cycle , except near the big - bang and the big - crunch .",
    "there , because of repulsive effects of quantum geometry , the wave function bounces when the peak reaches a minimum volume : v_min = ( 4g^2 3 ) ^12 p _",
    "( 1.2810 ^ -33 ) p_thus , the wave function does not enter a neighborhood of the classical singularity .",
    "the size of this neighborhood is dictated by the value of the constant of motion @xmath397 and can be _ much _ larger than the planck size .",
    "finally , note that in the mathematical limit in which the area gap @xmath97 is taken to zero , @xmath467 vanishes .",
    "more generally , this is also the limit in which lqc reduces to the theory .",
    "thus , one can use @xmath97 as a knob to turn on or off quantum geometry effects and understand the ` mechanism ' behind the singularity resolution .",
    "\\iii ) to better understand the physical conditions at the quantum bounce , let us consider a couple of examples . consider first a quantum state describing a universe which attains a maximum radius of a megaparsec .",
    "then the quantum bounce occurs when the volume reaches the value @xmath468 , _ some @xmath469 times the planck volume .",
    "_ as a second illustration , consider a semi - classical state representing a large universe whose density at the classical re - collapse is about the current density of our universe @xmath470 .",
    "then , the quantum bounce would occur at @xmath471 .",
    "thus the ` quantum ' or the ` planck ' regime is defined not by the volume of the universe but by the value of the matter density , or space - time curvature . in universes which grow to large macroscopic sizes",
    ", these quantities can attain planck scale even when the volume of the universe is large .",
    "figures quoted above were arrived at using our model where the scalar field is massless .",
    "the presence of potentials could significantly modify their values .",
    "still , since the values of @xmath467 are so huge , these considerations are useful in drawing qualitative conclusions .",
    "for example , they suggest that in universes which grow to macroscopic sizes , the so called ` @xmath472-effects ' associated with modifications of the matter hamiltonians due to quantum geometry will not be dynamically significant in homogeneous models ( unless one considers astronomically large and hence implausible values of @xmath456 ) .",
    "\\iv ) since detailed predictions were obtained only for states which are semi - classical at late times , it is interesting to ask _ how _ semi - classical these states have to be .",
    "how quantum mechanical can we make the parameters of the universe , still keeping the quantum state semi - classical in the sense used in this paper ?",
    "the typical values of @xmath397 used in the simulations reported in section [ s5 ] was @xmath473 .",
    "these universes evolve only to a maximum volume of @xmath474 before undergoing a recollapse .",
    "_ results of our numerical simulations show that the necessary semi - classical considerations hold already for such small universes . _ in particular",
    ", the maximum value @xmath7 of the matter density is well approximated by the critical value @xmath475 already for these universes .",
    "a combination of numerics and effective - equations shows that the approximation becomes increasingly better as one considers larger and larger universes .",
    "similarly , our numerical results have shown that the recollapse occurs at the classically predicted values already for these universes . in these cases ,",
    "the matter density even at the recollapse point is quite high , approximately @xmath476 .",
    "thus , several interesting phenomena occur in a rather small interval ( of just four to five orders of magnitude ) of density and volume . as our detailed plots show",
    ", there is a very narrow range of these parameters in which quantum geometry effects become significant .",
    "they grow extremely quickly , overwhelm the classical attractive force , cause the bounce and then become insignificant very quickly again .",
    "\\v ) we would like to emphasize that while quantum geometry effects resolve classical singularities , we did not predict the emergence of classicality at late times within any given cycle .",
    "these two issues are logically distinct .",
    "indeed , in our detailed analysis we simply restricted ourselves to a single cycle and to states which are semi - classical at late times therein . at first",
    ", it may appear that the problem of actually specifying such states would be impossibly difficult in more realistic models since such specification would have to incorporate all the complexities that have developed during the epoch during which the universe grew to a macroscopic size .",
    "however , as discussed above , this ` macroscopic size ' can be very small and the required specification of a semi - classical state could be done at a relatively early time before complicated structures develop .",
    "for example , in an inflationary scenario one could specify the state immediately after the end of inflation , or perhaps even before the onset of inflation since , in the current observationally favored scenarios , matter density is significantly smaller than the planck density even at the onset .",
    "thus , while the conceptual issue of singling out a preferred family of states using general principles remains largely unexplored , there do not appear to be any ` practical ' difficulties in specifying the state .",
    "\\vi ) since both the big bang and the big crunch singularities are resolved , the quantum wave function evolves through _ infinitely many _ classical cycles .",
    "thus , in the @xmath0=1 model , the quantum space - time of lqg is vastly larger than that the classical space - time of general relativity .",
    "the issue of emergence of semi - classicality raised above can now be elevated to the _ infinite _ history of the quantum universe .",
    "let us then begin a classical solution in which the maximum volume of the universe is large , say more than a megaparsec , and consider a quantum state which is peaked at a point on this classical trajectory at a late ` time ' , @xmath162 .",
    "as discussed in section [ s6 ] , this state has interesting properties .",
    "except near the classical singularities , it will remain sharply peaked not only on the given classical solution during its cycle but also for over @xmath455 cycles resulting from quantum bounces . however , because the eigenvalues of @xmath477 are not exactly evenly spaced , eventually the wave function will spread and cease to be semi - classical .",
    "the issue of converse is intriguing .",
    "consider any state which is sharply peaked at a large value of the constant of motion @xmath478 but has a large spread for the volume operator @xmath479 at the initial instant of ` time ' @xmath162 .",
    "initially , such a state is not semi - classical .",
    "however , would the lqc dynamics evolve it to a state which is eventually sharply peaked at a classical trajectory ?",
    "the answer appears to be in the affirmative @xcite .",
    "if so , all states which are peaked at a very large value of @xmath397 would eventually become semi - classical . in this precise sense",
    ", semi - classicality would be generic .      as discussed in section [ s1 ] ,",
    "a major challenge to any background independent quantum gravity approach , such as lqg , is to ensure that there is a sufficiently large semi - classical sector .",
    "lqc offers a non - trivial context to probe this issue .",
    "are the quantum geometry effects subtle enough to dominate near classical singularities but turn themselves off on large scales ? as results of @xcite show , this is a delicate issue .",
    "indeed , the evolution generated by the hamiltonian constraint that was generally used in lqc until recently ( the so - called ` @xmath127-evolution ' ) , the answer was in the negative .",
    "certain quantum effects associated with that evolution could alter the classical predictions even in regimes in which the matter densities and space - time curvatures are completely tame . in the @xmath0=0 case ,",
    "this severe drawback was overcome by the ` improved dynamics ' of @xcite .    in the @xmath0=1 models , the classical recollapse provides an excellent venue to test semi - classical viability because , as the analysis of section [ s6 ] shows , both the classical recollapse and the quantum bounce are governed by the same condition : the vanishing of @xmath480 . for the recollapse ,",
    "an agreement with the classical theory requires that quantum geometry effects be negligible while the bounce can occur only if these effects dominate . at first sight",
    "then there appears to be a tension . in @xcite , green and unruh analyzed this issue numerically in the same model as the one considered in this paper and concluded that the tension is real .",
    "more precisely , they used _",
    "the then available _ hamiltonian constraint of lqc @xcite and found numerical evidence against the occurrence of recollapse . for large universes ,",
    "the classical recollapse occurs when matter density and space - time curvatures are very small compared to the planck scale .",
    "therefore , a theory in which recollapse does not occur would contradict classical general relativity in a domain where there is every reason to expect its validity .",
    "although green and unruh did not have access to a physical inner product or observables to arrive at a definitive interpretation of their results , they concluded that it is unlikely that one could find an interpretation in which such large deviations from the classical theory are appropriate .",
    "in this paper we have overcome important limitations pointed out by green and unruh , thereby completing the lqc program .",
    "we found that lqc does predict a recollapse and , furthermore , it occurs at the values of matter density and volume predicted by the classical theory .",
    "how did this strikingly different conclusion come about ?",
    "we will conclude by first summarizing how the general criticisms of @xcite were addressed and then discussing the issue of the recollapse .",
    "\\i ) general framework : green and unruh began by pointing out that much of the then successes of lqc arose from effective equations and the interpretation of quantum states had remained unclear because the physical inner product and observables had not been specified .",
    "they pointed out that , in particular , the issue of time had not been addressed explicitly and the implicit use of the scale factor as time has obvious problems in the @xmath0=1 model . in this paper",
    "we showed that the use of the scalar field as emergent time is free of the difficulties associated with the multi - valued character of the scale factor in closed models .",
    "we constructed the physical sector of lqc in detail , including the physical inner product , dirac observables and well - controlled semi - classical states .",
    "we then numerically solved the hamiltonian constraint and calculated the expectation values and fluctuations of dirac observables . in particular , we analyzed dynamics in full lqc , not in just in an effective approximation .",
    "\\ii ) recollapse : our hamiltonian constraint is quite different from that used in @xcite .",
    "thus , the very starting points of the two sets of numerical simulations are distinct . in particular , while @xmath481 used in @xcite was _ not self - adjoint _ , ours is .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first , since our operator @xmath16 is self - adjoint on @xmath65 and we are guaranteed that it admits a complete set of eigenfunctions . furthermore since its spectrum is discrete @xcite the eigenfunctions in the spectral family are normalizable .",
    "this immediately implies that they must decay for large @xmath238 .",
    "our numerical simulations showed that the decay is exponential for large @xmath238 , which ensured that physically appropriate wave packets would exhibit a recollapse .",
    "the numerical task of actually finding these eigenfunctions was delicate because the normalizable ones constitute a set of ` zero measure ' among all eigenfunctions , i.e. , because ` most ' eigenfunctions diverge in at least one of the two asymptotic regimes @xmath482 .",
    "however , because @xmath16 is self - adjoint with appropriate properties , the existence of these eigenfunctions was ensured from the beginning .",
    "this was not the case for the analysis of @xcite .",
    "indeed the principal argument there was that the authors found only exponentially growing eigenfunctions , signaling absence of recollapse .",
    "secondly , for reasons discussed in sec.[s1 ] , it was important that we used the ` improved dynamics ' of @xcite ( rather than the older , ` @xmath127 evolution ' ) . finally , the effective - equation - analysis shows how lqc manages to have both the quantum bounce and the classical recollapse . for",
    ", the modified friedmann equation now has two roots : one a la classical general relativity at a low density causing the recollapse , and a _ new one _ near planck density causing the bounce .",
    "the quantum geometry effects are small at the old , classical root but cause and thus dominate the new root .",

    "<S> the closed , @xmath0=1 , frw model coupled to a massless scalar field is investigated in the framework of loop quantum cosmology using analytical and numerical methods . as in the @xmath1 case , the scalar field can be again used as emergent time to construct the physical hilbert space and introduce dirac observables . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting framework is then used to address a major challenge of quantum cosmology : resolving the big - bang singularity while retaining agreement with general relativity at large scales . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the framework fulfills this task . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for states which are semi - classical at some late time , the big - bang is replaced by a quantum bounce _ and _ a recollapse occurs at the value of the scale factor predicted by classical general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the ` difficulties ' pointed out by green and unruh in the @xmath0=1 case do not arise in a more systematic treatment . as in @xmath1 models , </S>",
    "<S> quantum dynamics is deterministic across the deep planck regime . </S>",
    "<S> however , because it also retains the classical recollapse , in contrast to the @xmath1 case one is now led to a cyclic model . </S>",
