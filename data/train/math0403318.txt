    "an important design issue for telecommunication systems and other applications is determining the buffer size when buffers are finite .",
    "we can better understand the effect of a particular buffer size by understanding the distribution of the maximum queue length during a busy period in an infinite buffer system .",
    "we give a characterization of the busy - period maximum queue length , @xmath1 , for the @xmath4 queue for three types of preemptive lcfs ( last - come first - served ) disciplines : ( i ) preempted services are resumed when service recommences ( lcfs - p - resume ) , ( ii ) preempted services must be restarted from scratch when service recommences and a new service time is chosen from the service - time distribution ( lcfs - p - repeat with resampling ) , and ( iii ) preempted services must be restarted from scratch when service recommences but the total service requirement for a given customer is the same each time it restarts its service ( lcfs - p - repeat - without - resampling ) .  these characterizations of @xmath1 for each of the queueing disciplines allow us to show the effect of service - time distributions on @xmath5 as stated in ( i)-(iii ) below . for a fixed service discipline ,",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath6 be the maximum number of customers during a busy period in two @xmath4 queues with respective generic service times @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and with the same arrival rate @xmath9 , and the same batch - size distribution .",
    "we assume that the distributions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are such that the queues are stable . in this paper",
    "we show that the following relations hold ; the definitions of the various stochastic orders can be found in the next section .",
    "( i ) : :    under the lcfs - p - resume discipline , if    @xmath10 , then    @xmath11 .",
    "( ii ) : :    under the lcfs - p - repeat ( with resampling ) discipline , if    @xmath12 , then    @xmath13 .",
    "( iii ) : :    under the lcfs - p - repeat - without - resampling discipline , if    @xmath14 , then    @xmath11 .",
    "a consequence of our results is the somewhat surprising conclusion that @xmath1 will be stochastically smaller when service times are more variable ( in the convex sense ) under the preemptive lcfs disciplines .",
    "miyazawa ( 1990 ) and miyazawa and shanthikumar ( 1991 ) show that for the finite - buffer @xmath15 queue under a non - preemptive discipline , the loss rate , i.e. , the probability that a random customer is lost , will be larger when service times are more variable in the convex sense .",
    "our result relates to the loss rate , but the effect goes in the other direction .",
    "that is , we have that for preemptive lcfs disciplines , @xmath16 is smaller when service times are larger in the convex sense , where @xmath16 can be interpreted as the probability of at least one loss during a busy period in the @xmath17 queue . see also chang , chao , pinedo , and shanthikumar ( 1991 ) .    for other results on the impact of the service time and batch size distributions on various performance measures of queueing systems ,",
    "see , for example , hordijk ( 2001 ) , makowski ( 1994 ) , and shanthikumar and yao ( 1994 ) , and the references therein . for other applications of the preempt - repeat service discipline , see , e.g. , adiri , frostig , and rinnooy kan ( 1991 ) , birge , frenk , mittenthal , and rinnooy kan ( 1990 ) , cai , sun , and zhou ( 2004 ) , and cai , wu , and zhou ( 2004 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first recall some definitions of stochastic ordering in the next section .",
    "we then study @xmath1 for each of the preemptive lcfs disciplines .",
    "finally we provide some numerical illustrations of our results .",
    "recall the following stochastic ordering relations for random variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath18 is larger than @xmath19 in the stochastic sense , @xmath20 , if @xmath21 for all increasing functions @xmath22 for which the expectations exist .",
    "equivalently , @xmath20 if and only if @xmath23 for all @xmath24 .    @xmath18 is larger than @xmath19 in the convex sense , @xmath25 , if @xmath26 for all convex functions @xmath27 for which the expectations exist .",
    "note that @xmath25 implies @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in this sense",
    "the convex ordering is an ordering of variability in random variables .",
    "@xmath18 is larger than @xmath19 in the increasing concave sense , @xmath30 , if @xmath31 for all increasing concave functions @xmath22 for which the expectations exist .",
    "@xmath18 is larger than @xmath19 in the laplace - transform sense , @xmath32 , if @xmath33\\leq e[e^{-\\theta y}]$ ] for all @xmath34 for which the expectations exist .",
    "note that @xmath25 implies @xmath35 , which in turn implies @xmath36 .",
    "finally , for reasons of brevity we use the following notation .",
    "when we say @xmath37 $ ] , we mean that @xmath38 for all @xmath39 .",
    "we first consider the @xmath4 queue with the lcfs preempt - resume ( lcfs - p - resume ) discipline .",
    "that is , the customer that has been in the system the least amount of time is always served , and newly arriving customers preempt earlier arrivals already in service . within a batch customers",
    "are arbitrarily labeled , so that we may think of them as arriving sequentially , though immediately after each other .",
    "thus , one customer in a newly arriving batch will be considered the most recent arrival and will immediately enter service , and the rest of the batch can not be served until that customer , as well as all customers arriving in later batches that preempt that customer , are served .",
    "customers who resume service after being preempted start their service where they left off .",
    "hence , a random service with service time @xmath7 that is preempted when @xmath24 units of service have already been received has remaining service time @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "we also assume service is non - idling .",
    "let @xmath41 be a generic interarrival time , where @xmath41 has an exponential distribution with rate @xmath42 , and let @xmath18 be a generic batch size with arbitrary distribution and mean @xmath43 .",
    "we assume that the queue is stable , @xmath44 .",
    "let customer 0 be the last customer in the first batch in the busy period , i.e. , the first customer to enter service , and let @xmath45 be the service time of customer 0 .",
    "let @xmath46 be the number of poisson batch arrival times that occur during the service of customer 0 , and let @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "note that the service will be interrupted if @xmath48 .",

    ".    we can think of constructing the busy period , conditional on @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as follows .",
    "denote the arrival epochs , on a clock that only ticks when customer 0 is being served , by @xmath65 .",
    "a batch of customers arrives at time @xmath66 and starts a new independent busy period ( and stops our clock temporarily ) , except that there are @xmath67 more customers in the queue ( the original customers ) throughout that busy period .",

    "another batch arrives at time @xmath69 , starting a new independent busy period , and so on , until the @xmath3 sub - busy periods have completed , as well as the original service time @xmath70 .",
    "then a new busy period starts with the other @xmath71 customers that arrived in the first batch , and the maximum queue length during that busy period has the same distribution as @xmath61 . because the arrival process is memoryless",

    "b ) , the induction hypothesis , and the assumption @xmath103 , it then follows that @xmath104this completes the proof .",
    "this theorem is illustrated by figures [ figuniform ] , figparetos and [ fighyperexp]below , showing the probabilities @xmath105 for ( convexly ordered ) families of uniform , pareto and hyperexponential distributions .    * remark * it is well known ( kelly , 1979 ) that the @xmath1/@xmath2/1 queue under the lcfs - p - resume discipline exhibits service time insensitivity in the sense that the marginal distribution of the number in the stationary system , @xmath106 , depends on the service - time distribution only through its mean . at first",
    "this seems at odds with our results , but we must bear in mind that the maximum number in the system during a busy period depends on the sample - path evolution of the queue length over a busy period .",
    "hence the behaviour of @xmath1 and @xmath106 may be very different .",
    "this idea is further illustrated by the following heuristic example .",
    "* example * let @xmath1 be the maximum number in system for an @xmath1/@xmath2/1 lcfs - p - resume queue with @xmath107 ( call this system 1 ) and let @xmath108 be the corresponding maximum when the first service time in a busy period , @xmath8 , is equally likely to be @xmath109 or @xmath110 so @xmath111 , and the other service times in the busy period are identically equal to 1 ( call this system 2 ) .",
    "then , for @xmath109 very small , the first busy period in system 2 is equally likely to be very short and have a maximum of 1 , or it will essentially consist of two busy periods , each evolving as a busy - period in system 1 .",
    "the second of these busy periods starts when the initial customer has received @xmath112 service .",
    "that is , roughly , @xmath6 is equally likely to be 1 or to have the same distribution as @xmath113 , so @xmath114 .",
    "note however that @xmath106 and @xmath115 have roughly the same distribution .",
    "indeed , @xmath116 , since the workload is the same in both systems . furthermore , a random arrival during a busy period in system 2 will either see a customer with @xmath117 in service , with very small probability , or will arrive during one of the two busy periods that each evolve as in system 1 .",
    "hence @xmath115 and @xmath106 have roughly the same distribution . finally note that the distribution of the length of a busy period does depend on the distribution of @xmath7.@xmath118    the @xmath119 lcfs - p - resume queue also exhibits insensitivity , i.e. , the distribution of the number in system , @xmath120 , depends on the distribution of @xmath7 only through its mean .",
    "hence , the loss rate in the @xmath119 queue , @xmath121 , is insensitive to the distribution of @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast , our result shows that the probability of at least one loss during a busy period , @xmath122 , does depend on the distribution of @xmath7 , and is greater when @xmath7 is larger in the laplace - transform sense .",
    "now we suppose that when services are preempted they must be restarted from scratch . the new service time is assumed to be an independent random variable with the same distribution .",
    "we call this the lcfs - p - repeat ( with resampling ) discipline . of course , the behavior of the queue under the lcfs - p - resume and lcfs - p - repeat disciplines is the same when service times are exponential .",
    "we use the same notation as in the previous subsection .",
    "now , for stability , we need @xmath123 and @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the effective service time , i.e. , the total time a random customer must spend in service , including restarts due to interruptions . thus , @xmath126where @xmath127 , and hence @xmath128for @xmath41 exponential with rate @xmath42",
    ", it is not hard to show that@xmath129and hence for stability we need @xmath130 .    for the @xmath4 lcfs - p - repeat queue",
    ", we can identify the following embedded random walk .",
    "the number in the system at arrival and departure epochs during a busy period is equivalent to a random walk on the nonnegative integers with absorbing state 0 .",
    "the random walk starts at the random point @xmath49 , decreases by 1 if @xmath131 ( a departure ) , and increases if @xmath132 ( an arrival ) .",
    "when it increases , it increases by @xmath18 , where @xmath18 is independent of @xmath7 and @xmath41 .",
    "thus , we have the following characterization of @xmath1 , where @xmath133 if @xmath132 and 0 otherwise , and other definitions are as in previous sections .",
    "[ withoutres ] the maximum queue length @xmath134 for the @xmath4 queue under the lcfs - p - repeat discipline satisfies @xmath135where @xmath60 , and @xmath136 , @xmath18 , and @xmath61 are mutually independent , and @xmath137 is independent of @xmath136 and @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath138 be 1 if @xmath139 , and 0 otherwise . if @xmath140 , then @xmath141 . from theorem [ withoutres ] and",

    "note that for the lcfs - p - repeat discipline , we only need for the laplace transform of the service time evaluated at ( the arrival rate ) @xmath42 to be ordered for two service - time distributions , rather than a complete laplace - transform ordering .",
    "thus , all possible distributions of service times can be completely ordered , and hence we have a complete stochastic ordering of the corresponding maximum queue lengths .",
    "of course , it is also true that @xmath145 implies @xmath10 , which in its turn implies @xmath12 .      for our final model ,",
    "we suppose again that when services are preempted they must be restarted from scratch , but now the service time is only drawn from the service - time distribution once .",
