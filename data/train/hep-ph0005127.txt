    "we explore a potential of @xmath0 - meson in extracting the parameters of sm lagragian , namely , the heavy quark masses .",
    "what concerns its spectroscopic properties , this meson stands among the families of charmonium @xmath3 and bottominum @xmath4 : two heavy quarks move nonrelativistically , since the confinement scale , determining the presence of light degrees of freedom ( sea of gluons and quarks ) , is suppressed with respect to the heavy quark masses @xmath5 as well as the coulomb - like exchanges result in transfers about @xmath6 , which is again much less than the heavy quark mass .",
    "it is precisely the nonrelativistic nature of heavy quark dynamics in the @xmath0-meson , that offers us a possibility to use the nrqcd framework and gain more inside on qcd dynamics of the constituent heavy quarks .",

    "the experience in potential models and quasi - local sum rules @xcite allow us to write @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the mass of @xmath183 @xmath0-meson state , and @xmath184 is its coupling . so that , the experimental spectral density has the form @xmath185 now with the knowledge of experimental spectral density and thus of experimental moments we can compare them with theoretical ones . to begin with let s see what values of the pole @xmath1-quark mass will give us the required values of experimental moments .",
    "for the value of @xmath8-quark pole mass @xmath186 , needed for calculation of theoretical moments , we have taken the result of nnlo analysis for @xmath7 family@xcite , so that we have @xmath187 gev .",
    "varying the soft scale in @xmath188 the range @xmath189 gev and fixing enters only through @xmath190 .",
    "so , the particular value of @xmath191 is not very important . ] the hard scale @xmath191 to @xmath192 gev , from the stability of the ratios of experimental to theoretical moments we have that @xmath193 gev .",
    "the range of pole @xmath1-quark mass obtained is quite large and to reduce it we need some extra condition to satisfy .",
    "again , from the spectroscopy of @xmath0-meson family it is known that the characteristic value of strong coupling constant for heavy quark dynamics inside @xmath0-meson is in the range @xmath194 .",
    "this extra requirement heavily constrains the value of @xmath1-quark pole mass , so that @xmath195 gev . at fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we have shown the ratios of experimental to theoretical moments as functions of momentum number at fixed value of @xmath196 gev and different values of @xmath1-quark pole mass .    to 1.5 cm to 15.cm    the performed analysis shows that to satisfy chosen criteria we need very low values of @xmath197 gev or lower . on the other hand ,",
    "as was shown in @xcite , to match perturbative heavy quark potential with full qcd potential at characteristic distances of quarks bound inside heavy - heavy mesons , we should have the soft scale @xmath188 in the region @xmath198 gev to achieve this goal we modify the original tipt for theoretical moments by shifting the leading order coulomb potential by a part of constant term in nlo potential , that is @xmath199 the resulting theoretical moments will now depend not only from hard and soft scales but also from the value of the shift parameter @xmath142 .",
    "to get rid of the latter dependence , while keeping in mind our goal , we perform optimization in parameter @xmath142 , require the nlo corrections to theoretical moments at given momentum number @xmath109 do not exceed @xmath200 . as a result",
    "we get @xmath201 gev . at fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the ratios of experimental to theoretical moments as functions of momentum number at fixed value of @xmath202 gev and different values of @xmath1-quark pole mass .",
    "we see , that within the error bars our results for the @xmath1-quark pole mass from these two estimates agree with each other as well as with the results of other estimates @xcite .    to 1.5 cm to 15.cm    having extracted the value of @xmath1-quark pole mass from @xmath0-sum rules , an analogous analysis can be performed for other definitions of heavy quark masses . below we give the numerical values of these masses obtained in the same way and comment on their relation with each other .",
    "first , let us consider the running @xmath1-quark mass related to the pole one by the following relation @xcite @xmath203\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(\\bar m ) } { \\pi}\\right)^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + [ 190.1 - 26.7 n_l + 0.653 n_l^2]\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(\\bar m ) } { \\pi}\\right)^3\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] our estimates for the @xmath204 mass are @xmath205 however , not pole not running quark masses are qood ones when one works in the region of energies close to threshold .",
    "as we have seen in the analysis performed above the two - point correlation function has a strong dependence on renormalization scales as well as correlation between the pole mass and strong coupling constant ( the situation is similar for running quark masses ) , so to reduce this dependence somewhat it s would be more appropriate to explore quark masses , whose use can eliminate as much as possible all such dependencies and correlations among parameters .",
    "for this reason here we give estimates of @xmath206 and potential subtracted @xmath1-quark masses .",
    "the former can be related to the pole mass @xmath207 with the help of following formulae @xcite @xmath208\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath209 , \\\\ \\delta^2 & = & \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s}{\\pi}\\right)^2[\\beta_0 ^ 2(\\frac{3}{4}l^2 + l + \\frac{\\zeta_3}{2 } + \\frac{\\pi^2}{24 } + \\frac{1}{4 } ) + \\beta_0\\frac{a_1}{2}(\\frac{3}{2}l + 1 ) + \\frac{\\beta_1}{4}(l + 1 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{a_1 ^ 2}{16 } + \\frac{a_2}{8 } + ( c_a - \\frac{c_f}{48})c_f\\pi^2 ] , \\\\ l & \\equiv & \\ln ( \\frac{\\mu } { c_f\\alpha_sm^{pole}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath210 with the use of these formulae we have the following estimate for @xmath206 @xmath1-quark mass at optimized value of @xmath202 gev - quark pole mass performed in modified tipt , as the shift of leading order coulomb potential implicitly includes part of nnlo corrections . however , as we do not have up to date the complete nnlo order analysis this result should be taken with care . ]",
    "@xmath211 having done this estimate it is instructive to compare it with the estimates of nlo analysis done in 1s scheme . to obtain the expressions for theoretical moments in this scheme we make a following substitution @xmath212 in all other places the heavy quark pole masses",
    "should be changed to @xmath206 masses .",
    "varying the scales in the same ranges as we did for pole @xmath1-quark mass we obtain , that the sum rules are stable themselves , but the ratio of experimental to theoretical moments is far from unity for reasonable values of @xmath206 @xmath1-quark mass mass on a small value given by nonperturbative corrections . ] .",
    "to solve this problem we again consider the modified tipt for theoretical moments .",
    "it is important , when writing expressions for theoretical moments , to make for consistency a similar shift in nlo order relation between pole and @xmath206 masses .",
    "performing calculations in modified @xmath206 scheme we obtain the following estimate for @xmath206 @xmath1-quark mass : @xmath213 gev , which , within the errors , is in agreement with previous estimate for @xmath206 @xmath1-quark mass . fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows us the ratios of experimental to theoretical moments as functions of momentum number at fixed values of @xmath202 gev and @xmath206 @xmath1-quark mass .    to 1.5 cm to 15.cm    to finish the discussion of @xmath206 @xmath1-quark mass we note , that even this mass was defined as @xmath214 minus one half of perturbative coulomb energy in @xmath215-meson , it can be equally well applied for @xmath0-meson as well as other systems , containing @xmath1-quark .",
    "the arguments here are the analog of upsilon expansion for charmed quarks and the fact , that the coulomb energy for static quarks does not depend on their flavors .",
    "the estimate for the value of potential subtracted @xmath1-quark mass was obtained from the relation of the latter to the running quark mass @xmath216 + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(\\bar m ) } { \\pi}\\right)^2[13.44 - 1.04 n_l \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{\\mu_f}{3\\bar m(\\bar m)}(a_1 + 4\\pi\\beta_0[\\ln\\frac{\\mu_f^2}{(m^{pole})^2}-2])]\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , at @xmath217 gev we have @xmath218 having completed the estimates of different @xmath1-quark masses , we can now perform estimates of the mass and coupling constant for the ground @xmath0-meson state , fixing the heavy quark masses at their central values .    to 1.5 cm to 15.cm    the results for mass and coupling of @xmath0-meson in momentum scheme of nrqcd sum rules can be easily seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .    to 1.5 cm to 15.cm    recently , the estimate of @xmath0 mass was obtained in the perturbative potential approach by fitting the masses of @xmath215 and @xmath7 in order to get a good covergency in @xmath54 and extract the heavy quark masses @xcite .",
    "the perturbative mass @xmath219 gev is very close to the our estimate in the framework of qcd sum rules .",
    "this fact indicates a small nonperturbative correction , which was limited by @xmath220 mev in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have presented complete nlo analysis for @xmath0-meson two - point nrqcd sum rules .",
