    "social media , such as dailystrength and twitter , is a fast growing and potentially rich source of _ voice of the patient _ data about experience in terms of benefits and side - effects of drugs and treatments  @xcite .",
    "however , natural language understanding from social media messages is a difficult task because of the lexical and grammatical variability of the language  @xcite .",
    "indeed , language understanding by machines requires the ability to recognise when a phrase refers to a particular concept .",
    "given a variable length phrase , an effective system should return a concept with the most similar meaning .",
    "for example , a twitter phrase ` no way i m gettin any sleep 2nite ' might be mapped to the medical concept ` insomnia ' ( snomed:193462001 ) , when using the snomed - ct dictionary  @xcite .",
    "the success of the mapping between social media phrases and formal medical concepts would enable an automatic integration between patient experiences and biomedical databases .",
    "existing works , e.g.  @xcite , mostly focused on extracting medical concepts from medical documents . for example , gobbel et al .   proposed a naive bayesian - based technique to map phrases from clinical notes to medical concepts in the snomed - ct dictionary .",
    "wang et al .   identified medical concepts regarding adverse drug events in electronic medical records . on the other hand , oconnor et al .",
    "investigated the normalisation of medical terms in twitter messages .",
    "in particular , they proposed to use the lucene retrieval engine to retrieve medical concepts that could be potentially mapped to a given twitter phrase , when mapping between twitter phrases and medical concepts .",
    "in contrast , we argue that the medical text normalisation task  @xcite can be achieved by using well - established phrase - based mt techniques , where we translate a text written in _ a social media language _ ( e.g.  ` no way i m gettin any sleep 2nite ' ) to a text written in _ a formal medical language _",
    "( e.g.  ` insomnia ' ) .",
    "indeed , in this work we investigate an effective adaptation of phrase - based mt to map a twitter phrase to a medical concept .",
    "moreover , we propose to combine the adapted phrase - based mt technique and the similarity between word vector representations to effectively map a twitter phrase to a medical concept .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are three - fold :    1 .",
    "we investigate the adaptation of phrase - based mt to map a twitter phrase to a snomed - ct concept .",
    "2 .   we propose to combine our adaptation of phrase - based mt and the similarity between word vector representations to map twitter phrases to formal medical concepts .",
    "we thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach using phrases from our collection of tweets related to the topic of adverse drug reactions ( adrs ) .",
    "phrase - based mt models ( e.g.  @xcite ) have been shown to be effective in translation between languages , as they learn local term dependencies , such as collocations , re - orderings , insertions and deletions .",
    "koehn et al",
    ".   showed that a phrase - based mt technique markedly outperformed traditional word - based mt techniques on several benchmarks . in this work , we adapt the phrase - based mt technique of koehn et al .   for the medical text normalisation task .",
    "in particular , we use the phrase - based mt technique to translate phrases from _ twitter language _ to _ formal medical language _ , before mapping the translated phrases to medical concepts based on the ranked similarity of their word vector representations .",
    "traditional approaches for creating word vector representations treated words as atomic units  @xcite . for instance , the one - hot representation used a vector with a length of the size of the vocabulary , where one dimension is on , to represent a particular word  @xcite .",
    "recently , techniques for learning high - quality word vector representations ( i.e.  distributed word representations ) that could capture the semantic similarity between words , such as continuous bags of words ( cbow )  @xcite and global vectors ( glove )  @xcite , have been proposed .",
    "indeed , these distributed word representations have been effectively applied in different systems that achieve state - of - the - art performances for several nlp tasks , such as mt  @xcite and named entity recognition  @xcite . in this work , beside using word vector representations to measure the similarity between translated twitter phrases and medical concepts , we use the similarity between word vector representations of the original twitter phrase and a medical concept to augment the adapted phrase - based mt technique .",
    "we discuss our adaptation of phrase - based mt for medical text normalisation in section  [ ssm1 ] .",
    "section  [ ssm2 ] introduces our proposed approach for combining similarity score of word vector representations with the adapted phrase - based mt technique .",
    "we aim to learn a translation between a twitter phrase ( i.e.  a phrase from a twitter message ) and a formal medical phrase ( i.e.  the description of a medical concept ) . for a given twitter phrase @xmath0",
    ", we find a suitable medical phrase @xmath1 using _ a translation score _",
    ", based on a phrase - based model , as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 can be calculated using any phrase - based mt technique , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we then rank translated phrases @xmath1 based on this translation score .",
    "the top-@xmath4 translated phrases are used for identifying the corresponding medical concept",
    ".    however , the translated phrase @xmath1 may not be exactly matched with the description of any target medical concepts .",
    "we propose two techniques to deal with this problem .",
    "for the first technique , we rank the target concepts based on the cosine similarity between the vector representation of @xmath1 and the vector representation of the description of each concept @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the vector representations of @xmath1 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "any technique for creating word vector representations ( e.g.  one - hot , cbow and glove ) can be used . note that if a phrase ( e.g.  @xmath9 ) contains several terms , we create a vector representation by summing the value of the same dimension of the vector representation of each term ( i.e.  element - wise addition ) .    on the other hand",
    ", the second technique also incorporates the ranked position @xmath10 of the translated phrase @xmath1 when translated from the original phrase @xmath0 using equation  ( [ eq : tr ] ) .",
    "indeed , the second technique calculates the similarity score as follows : @xmath11      as discussed in section  [ srelatedwork ] , word vector representations ( e.g.  created by cbow or glove ) can capture semantic similarity between words by itself .",
    "hence , we propose to map a twitter phrase @xmath0 to a medical concept @xmath12 , which is represented with a description @xmath5 , by linearly combining the cosine similarity , between vector representations of the twitter phrase @xmath0 and the description @xmath5 , with the similarity score computed using one of the adapted phrased - based mt techniques ( introduced in section  [ ssm1 ] ) , as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is calculated using one of the adapted phrase - based mt techniques described in section  [ ssm1 ] .",
    "to evaluate our approach , we use a collection of 25 million tweets related to adverse drug reactions ( adrs ) .",
    "in particular , these tweets are related to cognitive enhancers  @xcite and anti - depressants  @xcite that can have adverse side effects .",
    "we use 201 adr phrases and their corresponding snomed - ct concepts annotated by a phd - level computational linguist .",
    "these phrases were anonymised by replacing numbers , user ids , uris , locations , email addresses , dates and drug names with appropriate tokens e.g.  _ _",
    "number__.       we conduct experiments using 10-fold cross validation , where the twitter phrases are randomly divided into 10 separated folds .",
    "we address this task as a ranking task , where we aim to rank the medical concept with the highest similarity score , e.g.  calculated using equation  ( [ eq : mt - cos ] ) , at the top rank .",
    "hence , we evaluate our approach using mean reciprocal rank ( mrr ) measure  @xcite , which is based on the the reciprocal of the rank at which the first relevant concept is viewed in the ranking .",
    "in addition , we compare the significant difference between the performance achieved by our proposed approach and the baselines using the paired t - test ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we use three different techniques , including one - hot , cbow and glove , to create word vector representations used in our approach ( see section  [ smethod ] ) .",
    "in particular , the vocabulary for creating the one - hot representation includes all terms in the twitter phrases and the descriptions of the target snomed - ct concepts .",
    "meanwhile , we create word vector representations based on cbow and glove by using the word2vec and glove implementations .",
    "we learn the vector representations from the collections of tweets and medical articles , respectively , using window size of 10 words . the tweet collection ( denoted _ twitter",
    "_ ) contains 419,702,147 english tweets , which are related to 11 drug names and 6 cities , while the medical article collection ( denoted _ bmc _ ) includes all medical articles from the biomed central .",
    "for both cbow and glove , we create vector representations with vector sizes 50 and 200 , respectively ."
