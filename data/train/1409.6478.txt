    "ma - pbi@xmath0 belongs to the family of perovskites of chemical formula abx@xmath0 .",
    "the simplest possible abx@xmath0 perovskite consists of a high - symmetry cubic structure belonging to the space group @xmath1 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a  @xcite . in this structure",
    "the halogen atoms x@xmath2i occupy the vertices of regular corner - sharing bx@xmath3 octahedra , while the divalent metal atoms b@xmath2pb sit at the centres of the octahedra .",
    "the smallest volume enclosed by neighboring octahedra defines a cuboctahedral cavity and hosts the monovalent cation a@xmath2ch@xmath0nh@xmath0 .",
    "all the other possible perovskite structures can be imagined as obtained by rotating or distorting the bx@xmath3 octahedra , displacing the b metal atoms off - centre , and rotating the a cations within the cuboctahedral cavity  @xcite .",
    "[ fig1]b shows the electronic band structure of ma - pbi@xmath0 , which represents the starting point of our investigation .",
    "here we see that the electronic states at the top of the valence bands are of halide @xmath4-character , while those at the bottom of the conduction band are mainly derived from the metal @xmath4 states . at the same time",
    "the electronic states associated with the cation define bonding and antibonding bands arranged symmetrically around the band gap and located several electronvolts away from the band edges .",
    "an analysis of the electronic charge density shows that , as expected , the cation is singly ionised , and the pbi@xmath0 network is negatively charged  @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that the electronic structure of these metal - organic perovskites may be described by removing the cation from the structural model and compensating the negative charge of the pbi@xmath0 network using a positive background .",
    "[ fig1]b shows that the band structure obtained within this approximation is in good agreement with that from a complete calculation .",
    "the removal of the cation is especially useful since it eliminates the complications associated with the observed orientational disorder  @xcite .",
    "another important observation can be made by inspecting x - ray diffraction data , as reported for example in ref .",
    "in fact , from the structural parameters reported in that work we deduce that the pb - i bond lengths are extremely regular , the largest relative deviation from the average value of 3.18    being 0.1% .",
    "furthermore , the diagonals of the pbi@xmath3 octahedra are almost perpendicular to each other , the maximum deviation from right angles being of 4@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , to a good approximation the pbi@xmath3 octahedra may be considered as platonic solids carrying the full @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "based on these considerations we set to build a ` platonic ' model of metal - halide perovskites , consisting of regular corner - sharing pbi@xmath3 octahedra and no cation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]d . in order to construct our model",
    "we start from a single regular octahedron in a orthorhombic unit cell@xcite , with one diagonal parallel to the @xmath7 axis , and the four perpendicular edges parallel to the axes @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in the reference frame of the octahedron",
    "this diagonal and its perpendicular edges define the apical and equatorial directions , respectively . within this model , the most general perovskite structure",
    "is obtained by three successive rotations around @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath7 again using the standard euler angles@xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c : the spinning @xmath10 around the apical direction , the tilt @xmath11 around the @xmath8 axis , and the precession @xmath12 around the @xmath7 axis . after these rotations",
    ", the location and orientation of all the remaining octahedra in the orthorhombic unit cell are completely determined by the corner - sharing connectivity , the metal - halide bond length , and the periodicity of the crystal structure .",
    "the details of this geometric construction are given in the methods .",
    "an immediate result of our construction is that the only way to ensure corner - sharing connectivity is by having a vanishing spinning angle @xmath10 .",
    "this leaves us with only two independent angular parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which refer to a spherical system of coordinates clamped on the crystallographic unit cell .",
    "it is convenient to make a change of variables to intrinsic angular parameters which are independent on the choice of the unit cell . to this end",
    "we express @xmath11 and @xmath12 in terms of the metal - halide - metal bond angles @xmath13 and @xmath14 , as indicated in fig .",
    "@xmath13 denotes the pb - i - pb bond angles along the apical direction , and @xmath14 those along the equatorial direction .",
    "the relation between these intrinsic angles and the euler angles is given in the methods .",
    "at this point the atomic structure of the platonic perovskite model is uniquely determined by the choice of two metal - halide - metal bond angles and the metal - halide bond length .",
    "given that the effect of bond length variations on the electronic and optical properties of these systems has been studied in detail , both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite , our geometric analysis clearly directs attention to the role of the two inequivalent pb - i - pb angles .      in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the band gap of the platonic model calculated using density functional theory ( dft ) as a function of the apical and equatorial bond angles @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for definiteness we set the pb - i bond length to the average value measured in ref .",
    "the incomplete coverage of the parameter space in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] reflects the fact that only certain pairs of apical and equatorial angles are compatible with the corner - sharing connectivity , as discussed in the methods . the extremal parameters of this map are , on the one side , @xmath15 ( bottom left corner ) , corresponding to the most symmetric cubic perovskite structure with collinear pb - i - pb bonds . on the other side we have @xmath16 ( top right corner ) , which we have chosen by considering a limiting structure where the shortest distance between iodine atoms belonging to different octahedra matches the i@xmath17 bond length ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the variation of the angular coordinates in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] clearly induces a substantial modulation of the band gap , from the top of the mid - infrared ( 1.1  ev ) to the beginning of the visible spectrum ( 1.9  ev ) .",
    "this trend is in line with earlier calculations on simpler two - dimensional sn - i perovskites for solution - processable electronics  @xcite .",
    "the qualitative trend shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] can be interpreted using elementary tight - binding arguments .",
    "if we consider for definiteness the bottom of the conduction band at @xmath20 , which is most affected by bond angles , in the case of @xmath15 there are three degenerate electronic states derived from the @xmath21 orbitals of pb ( without considering spin - orbit coupling for simplicity ; this coupling is fully included in all our final results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) .",
    "it is intuitive that the energy of these states results mainly from @xmath22 bonding integrals since all the pb - i bonds are collinear  @xcite . by moving away from the bottom",
    "left corner , the degeneracy is lifted as the bond integrals acquire @xmath23 components weighted by the angles @xmath13 and  @xmath14 .",
    "both components tend to raise the energy levels , therefore the conduction band bottom results from the competition between the antibonding orbitals with the lowest energy along the apical or the equatorial direction .",
    "this is consistent with the approximate symmetry of the map in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with respect to the line corresponding to @xmath24 .",
    "more importantly this reasoning suggests that the band gap of the platonic perovskite model is governed by the largest pb - i - pb bond angle in the metal - halide network , consistent with the trend in fig .",
    "this relation between band gap and bond angles holds unchanged when considering fully relativistic calculations including spin - orbit corrections .",
    "in fact , as shown in supplementary figure  1 , relativistic effects induce a large but slowly - varying red shift of 0.8 - 1.1 ev across the family of compounds considered in this work . for the sake of completeness we also checked that excitonic effects play only a minor role , with exciton binding energies never exceeding 80  mev as shown by supplementary figure  2 .",
    "details on the calculation of exciton binding energies are given in the supplementary methods , and the results are discussed in the supplementary note  1 .",
    "after taking into account the presence of the cation and the variations in the pb - i bond lengths and pb - i - pb angles , the calculated band gaps deviate from the idealised predictions in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by 0.1 - 0.3  ev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and discussion below ) . nonetheless the general trend , which spans a range of up to  1  ev , is robust .",
    "this picture is also confirmed by relativistic @xmath25 calculations on a few selected compounds , as shown in supplementary figure  4 .",
    "the trend identified here suggests that in order to make low - gap perovskites for optimum photovoltaic efficiency we need to engineer structures with minimal octahedral tilt . on the other hand , in order to make large - gap perovskites for light - emitting diodes operating in the visible , we need to design structures with maximum tilt .",
    "the remaining question is how the tilt angle can be controlled .",
    "the pb - i - pb bond angles define the volume of the cuboctahedral cavity , therefore it is intuitive that the use of larger cations may lead to values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 closer to straight angles@xcite . in the search for such cations",
    "we perform dft calculations for existing structures as well as for many hypothetical structures not considered hitherto , including full structural optimisations ( atomic positions , unit cell , and lattice parameters ) and spin - orbit interactions , in the presence of the cation ( see methods ) . in order to relate these structures and their properties to the predictions of the platonic model , we consider the average values of the pb - i - pb bond angles and of the pb - i bond length over a crystalline unit cell .",
    "these values are used as the coordinates needed for locating each structure on the map of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "previously reported cations are methylammonium ch@xmath0nh@xmath26 @xcite , formamidinium ch@xmath17(nh@xmath17)@xmath27  @xcite , the alkali metal cs@xmath28  @xcite ( synthesised ) and ammonium nh@xmath29  @xcite ( proposed ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] all these cations cluster around the centre of the map , therefore they are not expected to yield a significant modulation of the band gap . in line with this result",
    "their measured optical absorption onsets are very similar , within 0.25  ev  @xcite .    in order to explore a wider portion of the map we consider four different families of cations generated from those above .",
    "the first family consists of secondary , tertiary , and quaternary ammonium cations , namely di- , tri- and tetra - methylammonium .",
    "these are large molecules obtained by replacing hydrogen atoms bonded to the n atom with methyl groups .",
    "the second family is generated from ammonium by descending the pnictogen column in the periodic table , that is by substituting n for p , as , or sb .",
    "members of this family include phosphonium ( ph@xmath29 ) , arsonium ( ash@xmath29 ) , stibonium ( sbh@xmath29 ) , and similarly the methylammonium analogues ch@xmath0ph@xmath26 , ch@xmath0ash@xmath26 and ch@xmath0sbh@xmath26",
    ". the third family of cations that we consider is obtained by replacing hydrogen in ammonium by halogen atoms , and possibly nitrogen by another pnictogen : in this group we have nf@xmath29 , ncl@xmath29 , pf@xmath29 , and pcl@xmath29 .",
    "the fourth and final family simply consists of the alkali metals li@xmath28 , na@xmath28 , k@xmath28 , and rb@xmath28 . in total",
    "we consider 22 structures , including 18 hypothetical compounds not reported to date .    in order to quantify the steric size of each cation",
    ", we use the radius of the sphere which contains 95% of the dft electron density .",
    "this choice ensures that the steric radii of the alkali metals are in agreement with their standard ionic radii @xcite . for completeness",
    "the calculated steric sizes are reported in supplementary table  1 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that the steric radii of the cations considered in this work span a wide range , from 0.7    ( li@xmath28 ) to 2.9    ( pcl@xmath29 ) .",
    "our structural optimisations indicate that for some of the large cations the three - dimensional perovskite network is significantly distorted .",
    "this is in line with previous studies showing that large molecular cations determine a reorganisation of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) perovskite network into a two - dimensional ( 2d ) layered structure.@xcite these large molecules include tertiary and quaternary methylammonium cations , as well as the tetrafluoride nf@xmath29 and the tetrachloride pcl@xmath29 .",
    "as these structures depart substantially from the three - dimensional metal - halide network considered in this work , a separate analysis would be required .",
    "accordingly we do not consider them further .",
    "[ fig3]a shows that the largest pb - i - pb angles correlate strongly with the steric size of the cation ( spearman correlation 88% ) , in line with our initial expectation .",
    "the newly proposed structures span a range of angles from 130@xmath5 to 170@xmath5 , thereby covering a much wider portion of the band gap map in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] than presently possible .",
    "in addition fig .",
    "[ fig3]b shows that , in agreement with the predictions of the platonic model , the band gap correlates strongly with the largest pb - i - pb angle in the unit cell ( spearman correlation 91% ) . for completeness in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b we report the band gaps obtained from this model as well as those calculated using the fully optimised structures within fully - relativistic dft calculations . the scatter of the data which is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b is mostly due to the variation of the pb - i bond lengths in the metal - halide network .",
    "we calculated the correlation coefficient between band gap and bond lengths using the same data , and we obtained a very weak correlation ( spearman coefficient 9% ) .",
    "this test clearly indicates that the role of bond lengths represents a second - order effect , thereby providing further support to our platonic model .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig3]c shows our main finding , namely that by suitably choosing the cation it is possible , at least in principle , to fine - tune the band gap almost continuously over a very wide range of photon energies .",
    "our analysis highlights several new promising structures , in particular perovskites with phosphonium ( ph@xmath29 ) , arsonium ( ash@xmath29 ) , and stibonium ( sbh@xmath29 ) , all with band gaps ranging between 1.2 and 1.4  ev .",
    "these values fall in the middle of the range for optimum photovoltaic efficiency , and suggest that our new structures hold potential as novel solar cells materials . besides the low gap",
    ", these perovskites are expected to exhibit higher mobilities than ma - pbi@xmath0 .",
    "in fact , as shown in supplementary figure  2a and 2b , the carrier effective masses decrease towards larger bond angles , consistent with the concomitant reduction of the band gap .",
    "in addition to lower gaps and effective masses , large cations have the advantage that the filling of the cuboctahedral cavity should counter the known tendency of perovskite solar cells to degrade by water incorporation  @xcite .    in order to evaluate the practical feasibility of the hypothetical perovskites identified in this work we searched for possible dynamical instabilities in one of the structures with the smallest band gap , ash@xmath30pbi@xmath0 ( ncl@xmath29 is less interesting due to safety concerns related to chlorides ) .",
    "this structure is especially interesting since the preparation could proceed through the corresponding iodide ash@xmath30i  @xcite , similarly to the case of methylammonium iodide ch@xmath0nh@xmath0i .",
    "as shown by supplementary figure  3 , the vibrational density of states calculated using density - functional perturbation theory  @xcite does not exhibit any soft modes , thereby indicating that the 3d perovskite structure of ash@xmath30pbi@xmath0 should be stable against distortions . more generally , in order to assess the stability of all the structures considered here",
    ", we move to a simple semi - empirical approach based on the goldschmidt tolerance factor @xmath31  @xcite ( see methods for the definition of @xmath31 ) .",
    "it is known empirically that 3d perovskites should form when the tolerance factor falls within a narrow range @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "[ fig4]a shows that the tolerance factors derived from our calculated steric sizes falls within this range for most of the structures considered here . in particular , according to this criterion , all the cations up to rb and k should be stable .    in order to demonstrate the band gap tunability we attempted the synthesis of perovskites based on elemental cations , building on our experience with cspbi@xmath0  @xcite ( see methods ) .",
    "as deposited , we observed that cspbi@xmath0 formed a pale phase with a wide bandgap . upon annealing",
    "this structure turned into a dark phase with a band gap of 1.73 ev , which we identify as the 3d perovskite structure discussed in this work .",
    "the synthesis of films with cations smaller than cs ( rb , k , na , li ) yielded similar pale phases .",
    "however , upon annealing , some of the films degraded via sublimation before we could observe a dark phase as for cspbi@xmath0 , suggesting that 3d perovskites were not formed .",
    "this finding is in agreement with our analysis of the goldschmidt tolerance factor shown in fig .",
    "while the proposed 3d perovskites could possibly be synthesised using higher pressures or longer annealing runs at lower temperatures , here for the sake of simplicity we did not pursue this direction .",
    "instead we considered an alternative approach and explored mixtures of cations , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite : if mixtures of cs and smaller cations could gradually shift the bandgap towards the larger values , this would confirm our predicted tunabiliy via steric effects .    as a proof - of - concept we prepared perovskites with rb / cs cation mixtures , namely rb@xmath33cs@xmath34pbi@xmath0 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ( never hitherto reported ) .",
    "optical characterisation of these films , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b , indicates that the absorption edge blue - shifts from 720  nm to 690  nm in going from cs to rb .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with our calculations , which predict a corresponding blue shift of 40  nm .",
    "our findings are also in line with a recent study ( which appeared while the present manuscript was under review ) where the authors demonstrated band gap tunability via mixing of ch@xmath0nh@xmath26/cs@xmath28 mixtures  @xcite . taken together our present results and those of ref.@xcite confirm the tunability of the band gap via the steric size of the cation over almost half of our predicted range , thereby providing strong support to our theory .",
    "in conclusion , by means of first - principles computational design we have established that it should be possible to continuously tune the band gap of lead - iodide perovskites over almost one electronvolt by controlling the octahedral tilt via the steric size of the cation .",
    "we identified the largest metal - halide - metal bond angle as a reliable descriptor of the band gap in these systems . following the predictions of a geometric model we investigated many new potential candidate perovskites retaining the metal - halide network of methylammonium lead - iodide , including fourteen structures not reported to date .",
    "prompted by our theoretical analysis , we proceeded to the experimental synthesis and characterization of novel mixed - cation rb@xmath33cs@xmath34pbi@xmath0 perovskites , and we confirmed our predicted band gap trends via optical spectroscopy .    since our theory is based on very general considerations and its predictions",
    "are not linked to the underlying calculation method , it is expected that it will carry similar predictive power across other families of metal - halide perovskites .",
    "more fundamentally , the ability to control the band gap via the steric size of the cation , as proposed in this work , may become a new paradigm in the solution - deposition of solar cells , light - emitting diodes , and photonic structures with layer - by - layer control of their optical properties .",
    "all calculations were performed within the local density approximation to density functional theory  @xcite using planewaves and pseudopotentials , as implemented in the quantum espresso software package  @xcite .",
    "only valence electrons were described explicitly , and the core - valence interaction was taken into account by means of ultrasoft pseudopotentials  @xcite with non - linear core correction  @xcite . for pb and i",
    "we used fully relativistic ultrasoft pseudopotentials . in the case of pb we included the @xmath38 semicore states , and for sb , rb , and cs we used norm conserving pseudopotentials  @xcite .",
    "the electron wavefunctions and the charge density were expanded in planewaves basis sets with kinetic energy cutoffs 40  ry and 200  ry , respectively .",
    "structural optimization was performed by sampling the brillouin zone using uniform and unshifted 4@xmath394@xmath394 meshes .",
    "electronic structure calculations were performed using a 6@xmath396@xmath396 brillouin zone grid .",
    "all structural optimizations were initialized using the crystallographic data for ma - pbi@xmath0 reported in ref .",
    "the initial coordinates of the molecular cations were chosen in such a way that the centre of mass is located in the middle of the cuboctahedral cavity , and the orientation of the four inequivalent cations in one unit cell follows the symmetry properties of the @xmath40 space group . given the complexity of the total energy landscape of these systems , we checked the sensitivity of the structure with respect to the choice of the initial configuration in the case of nh@xmath30pbi@xmath0 .",
    "this compound lies close to the stability limit ( figure  4b ) , and can form quasi-1d structures in the presence of water  @xcite . in this case",
    "we performed structural optimizations using three additional initial configurations : ( i ) @xmath41 , ( ii ) @xmath42 and @xmath43 with octhaedra in phase along the apical direction , ( iii ) same as in ( ii ) but with octahedra out of phase .",
    "the optimized structures are all 3d perovskites , with total energy differences within 6  mev / atom . the largest deviation from the band gap reported in fig .",
    "3c is of 0.2  ev , and reflects the differences in the bond angles , following the trend predicted by the platonic model in fig .  2 .",
    "in the case of ma - pbi@xmath0 it has been established that the spin - orbit interaction tends to reduce the scalar - relativistic band gap by approximately 1 - 1.1  ev  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath25 quasiparticle corrections do increase the value of the band gap  @xcite . given these compensating corrections , and",
    "the fact that the very small relativistic band gaps are likely to induce significant errors in the calculation of the screened coulomb interaction @xmath44 , it is sensible to take scalar - relativistic calculations as the most consistent and unambiguous way to capture trends and identify the most promising structures . in order to check that the band gap trend obtained with dft / lda holds when using a higher level theory , we performed @xmath45 calculations using the ` yambo ` code  @xcite for a few selected structures , namely ash@xmath30pbi@xmath0 , ch@xmath0nh@xmath0pbi@xmath0 , cspbi@xmath0 and lipbi@xmath0 .",

    ", the fact that the structure of the platonic model is completely defined once we specify the values of two angles and the b - x bond length is quite remarkable .",

    "this occurred at @xmath112400@xmath5c for cspbi@xmath0 and even higher for the cs / rb mixtures discussed in the main text .",

    "<S> owing to their high energy - conversion efficiency and inexpensive fabrication routes , solar cells based on metal - organic halide perovskites have rapidly gained prominence as a disruptive technology . </S>",

    "<S> rational _ in silico _ design represents a powerful tool for mapping the vast materials landscape and accelerating discovery . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that the optical band gap of metal - halide perovskites , a key design parameter for solar cells , strongly correlates with a simple structural feature , the largest metal - halide - metal bond angle . using this descriptor we suggest continuous tunability of the optical gap from the mid - infrared to the visible . </S>",
    "<S> precise band gap engineering is achieved by controlling the bond angles through the steric size of the molecular cation . </S>",

    "<S> in fact , within less than two years of development , the photovoltaic energy - conversion efficiency of these devices increased from the initial 10.9%  @xcite to the current record of 17.9%  ( nrel ) . </S>",
    "<S> this impressive trend fuelled the expectation that perovskite photovoltaics may soon revolutionise the solar energy landscape .    </S>",
    "<S> given the unusually long lifetimes of the photoexcited carriers  @xcite and the relatively low optical gap  @xcite , it has been proposed that the perovskite layer may act both as the light absorber and as the electron and hole transporter  @xcite , similarly to bulk semiconductor solar cells . within this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that the energy - conversion efficiency can be increased by following the standard schockley - queisser analysis , that is by reducing the optical band gap to values near 1.3 - 1.4  ev  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> substantial efforts are currently underway to optimise these solar cells by modifying the metal - halide network or the organic cation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a major challenge in this research area is that , on the experimental front , the structural , electronic , and optical properties of metal - organic perovskites are very sensitive to processing conditions . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , computational modelling studies appear sensitive to the level of theory and calculation details . </S>",
    "<S> this state of affairs suggests that it may be convenient to shift the focus from the investigation of a few prototypical perovskites to global searches relying on rational design approaches .    </S>",
    "<S> in this work we propose that , instead of modifying the metal - halide network as already done in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it could be advantageous to start from ma - pbi@xmath0 ( ma = ch@xmath0nh@xmath0 ) , and modify its electronic and optical properties without altering the pbi@xmath0 network . </S>",
    "<S> this strategy would allow us to investigate potential improvements while retaining highly desirable features such as long carrier lifetimes  @xcite . in the following , using a combination of geometric arguments and first - principles calculations , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that it should indeed be possible to modulate the optical gap of lead - iodide perovskites over almost an electronvolt by acting on the pb - i - pb bond angles in the pbi@xmath0 network . </S>",
    "<S> these angles , in turn , can be tailored using cations of different sizes , without altering the metal - halide chemistry . </S>"
