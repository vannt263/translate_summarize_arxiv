    "we relate @xmath0 to the renormalized coupling constant @xmath2 as defined in the @xmath11 scheme at a scale @xmath12 ; at large momenta , these quantities are related as follows @xmath13 ( @xmath14 lattice spacing ) .",
    "the 1-loop coefficient @xmath15 has been known for a long time ; several evaluations of @xmath16 have also appeared in the past @xmath1710 years , either in the absence of fermions @xcite , or using the wilson @xcite or clover @xcite fermionic actions .",
    "knowledge of @xmath16 , along with the 3-loop @xmath1-renormalized @xmath9-function @xcite allows us to derive the 3-loop bare lattice @xmath9-function , which dictates the dependence of lattice spacing on @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , it provides a correction to the standard 2-loop asymptotic scaling formula defining @xmath18 .",
    "ongoing efforts to estimate the running coupling from the lattice @xcite have relied on a mixture of perturbative and non - perturbative investigations . as a particular example , relating @xmath19 to @xmath20 ( sf : schrdinger functional scheme , as advocated by the alpha collaboration ) , entails an intermediate passage through the bare coupling and the conversion from @xmath19 to @xmath21 is carried out perturbatively .",

    "one first complication is the size of the algebraic form of the feynman vertices ; as an example , the vertex with 4 gluons and a fermion - antifermion pair contains @xmath17724,000 terms when expanded . upon contraction",
    "these vertices lead to huge expressions ( many millions of terms ) ; this places severe requirements both on the efficiency of the computer algorithms which we must design to manipulate such expressions automatically and on the necessary computer ram . numerical integration of feynman diagrams over loop momentum variables is performed on a range of lattices , with finite size @xmath22 , and subsequent extrapolation to @xmath23 .",
    "as it turned out , larger @xmath22 were required for an accurate extrapolation in the present case , compared to ultra - local actions .",
    "in addition , since the results depend nontrivially on the parameter @xmath7 of the overlap action , numerical evaluation must be performed for a sufficiently wide set of values of @xmath7 , with an almost proportionate increase in cpu time .",
    "extreme values of @xmath7 ( @xmath24 ) show unstable numerical behaviour , which is attributable to the spurious poles of the fermion propagator at these choices ; this forces us to even larger @xmath22 .",
    "a consequence of all complications noted above is an extended use of cpu time : our numerical integration codes , which ran on a 32-node cluster of dual cpu pentium iv processors , required a total of @xmath1750 years of cpu time .",
    "the definition and value of the renormalized coupling constant @xmath25 depends on the renormalization scheme ( parameterized by a scale @xmath26 ) , and this dependence is given by the renormalized @xmath9-function @xmath27 we will adopt the @xmath1 renormalization scheme throughout this work , and we will denote the renormalized coupling constant @xmath2 simply by @xmath25 . for the lattice regularization",
