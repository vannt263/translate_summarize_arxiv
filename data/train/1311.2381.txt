    "two - component bose - einstein condensates with linear inter - component coupling have become an object of considerable interest associated with their non - trivial dynamical properties , such as onset of self - trapping in rabi oscillations , @xmath4-oscillations @xcite , bifurcations in rabi oscillations @xcite , miscibility - immiscibility transitions induced by rabi coupling @xcite , to name a few .",
    "owing to the close analogy with josephson transitions , these two - component mixtures are often referred to as the bose - josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "they are also considered as advantageous tools for storage of quantum information @xcite , or for manufacturing of high - precision atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "usually , two ways of composing a bose - josephson junction are considered . the first one is based on the creation of the double - well optical potential .",
    "then different components relate to the condensate fractions trapped inside different wells , and the linear inter - component coupling is provided by inter - well tunneling . the second way is the usage of condensates occupying the same trap but belonging to different hyperfine energy levels",
    ". the resonant microwave radiation causes transitions between the levels , providing linear inter - component coupling . in both these situations atomic ensembles",
    "are tightly confined inside the optical trap , and spatial expansion of the condensate is limited .",
    "elimination of the bec expansion allows one to describe the inter - component transitions by means of the classical equations of motion corresponding to a pendulum - like hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it is reasonable to examine the case when the mixture of two linearly - coupled hyperfine states is loaded into the optical lattice and allowed to expand along many potential wells , that is , spatial bec expansion can not be eliminated .",
    "this system can be regarded as an array of bose - josephson junctions @xcite and considered as a promising way for creating large - scale entangled states @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that interplay between external ( i.e. spatial ) and internal ( corresponding to level transitions ) degrees of freedom can essentially complexify atom dynamics even in the absence of interactions between atoms .",
    "earlier studies in the semiclassical regime for the spatial atomic dynamics revealed many intriguing phenomena like chaotic rabi oscillations @xcite , chaotic atomic transport and dynamical fractals @xcite , occurrence of lvy flights and anomalous diffusion @xcite , synchronization between spatial and internal dynamics @xcite .",
    "a detailed theory of chaotic atomic transport of atoms in a laser standing wave has been developed in refs .",
    "obviously , presence of interactions between atoms should cause additional complications of the underlying physics .    in the present work we consider the bec mixture loaded into the lattice in the presence of interactions between atoms .",
    "our main goal is to describe the main regimes of spatial and internal dynamics of the bec mixture , and to study how dynamics of rabi oscillations changes with increasing the interaction strength .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we represent the model considered and give brief description of the dynamics when tunneling between neighbouring lattice sites is negligible and there is no spatial condensate expansion .",
    "section [ spatial ] describes spatial bec dynamics when tunneling becomes significant . in section",
    "[ internal ] we examine how spatial dynamics influences inter - component transitions .",
    "the results obtained are discussed in summary .",
    "within the mean - field approximation , the condensate dynamics is governed by the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are macroscopic wave functions corresponding to the first and the second hyperfine states , respectively , @xmath8 is the lattice potential , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the nonlinearity parameters corresponding to intra - component interaction , @xmath11 is the nonlinearity parameter quantifying the inter - component interaction , @xmath12 is the rabi frequency being the rate of the inter - component transitions , and @xmath13 is the transition detuning .",
    "hereafter we shall consider the case of @xmath14 .    in the absence of rabi coupling , @xmath15 , spatial dynamics is controlled by the lattice height and nonlinearity parameters .",
    "the lattice height determines the rate of tunneling between neighbouring sites .",
    "strong nonlinearity can significantly reduce the wavepacket expansion due to spatial self - trapping @xcite .",
    "in addition , dynamics of two - component condensate mixtures with repulsive interactions ( positive nonlinearity parameters ) between atoms qualitatively depends on whether this mixture is miscible or not .",
    "the condition of immiscibility can be formulated as follows @xmath16 i.  e. inter - component repulsion should prevail over intra - component repulsion .",
    "presence of the rabi coupling can drive the mixture from miscible to immiscible regime and vice versa @xcite . in experiments ,",
    "each of the nonlinearity parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be tuned via the feshbach resonance .",
    "as long as different components correspond to the same atoms , one can assume @xmath17 .",
    "if the lattice is sufficiently deep , one can simplify the problem by means of the tight - binding approximation @xcite . in this way",
    ", it is assumed that the majority of energy is preserved in the first energy band , and one can expand the wavefunctions @xmath6 and @xmath7 over first - band wannier states corresponding to the decoupled problem , i.  e. @xmath15 .",
    "one has to take care that the tight - binding approximation becomes essentially questionable if the criterion ( [ immiscible ] ) is satisfied . in the immiscible regime ,",
    "initially uniform mixture undergoes fragmentation due to spatial separation of different components inside individual lattice sites @xcite , that is , the wavepackets occupying individual lattice sites acquire essentially non - symmetric form and can not be represented as superposition of the first - band wannier states . taking this into account , we set @xmath18 inferring the most unfavorable conditions for demixing .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( [ 2gp ] ) reduce to the coupled discrete gross - pitaevskii equations @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are complex - valued amplitudes of the condensate wave function at the lattice site @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the hopping rate describing tunneling between neighbouring sites . to our knowledge ,",
    "the first systematic study of such models was presented in @xcite , where some particular analytical solutions were found .",
    "similar models were considered in @xcite .",
    "hereafter we shall use the scaling of variables which corresponds to @xmath24 .",
    "firstly , let s consider the case of uncoupled lattice sites , @xmath25 .",
    "it corresponds to large values of the lattice potential height , when tunneling can be neglected . in this case",
    "total occupation of each site @xmath26 is time - independent . substituting @xmath27 into ( [ tb ] ) , and after some simple algebra",
    ", we obtain the system of equations @xmath28 where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to the rescaled time @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the normalized population imbalance corresponding to the @xmath22-th lattice site , @xmath31 @xmath32 . equations ( [ zsys ] ) originate from the classical hamiltonian @xmath33 this expression is similar to the hamiltonian of the nonlinear pendulum .",
    "the main difference is the presence of the factor @xmath34 . as this factor depends on @xmath35 , the phase space structure corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] )",
    "crucially depends on the parameter @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath37 , i.  e. in the case of weak nonlinearity , the phase portrait corresponding to eqs .",
    "( [ zsys ] ) contains a family of center fixed points located at @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "any trajectory of ( [ zsys ] ) is rotation in phase space around one of the fixed points @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to oscillations of the population imbalance @xmath35 with zero mean .",
    "this dynamical regime can be referred to as the rabi regime @xcite .",
    "if @xmath41 , the fixed point located at @xmath38 , @xmath42 undergoes the pitchfork bifurcation , that is , it transforms into three fixed points , one saddle and two centers .",
    "the saddle fixed point is located at @xmath38 , @xmath42 , i.  e. at the same place as the center fixed point before the bifurcation .",
    "the `` new '' center fixed points are located at @xmath43 , @xmath42 .",
    "each of them is surrounded by the domain of population imbalance oscillations with nonzero mean , that is , one component dominates over another .",
    "this regime can be referred to as the _ internal self - trapping_. this phenomenon was earlier observed for the cases of interacting @xcite and non - interacting @xcite atoms .",
    "further growth of the intercation strength @xmath44 moves the center fixed points towards limiting values of the population imbalance , @xmath45 , with increasing of the phase space area corresponding to the internal self - trapping .",
    "for moderate values of the optical potential height , @xmath46 recoil energies or less , tunneling between lattice sites becomes meaningful and has to be taken into account .",
    "tunneling results in spatial spreading of an atomic wavepacket along the lattice , thereby reducing local condensate density .",
    "however , if the interaction energy @xmath47 exceeds some threshold value , there can occur spatial self - trapping , when wavepacket depletion becomes very slow due to formation of steady soliton - like states @xcite .",
    "spatial spreading also depends on the wavepacket form , in particular , on its width and spatial modulation @xcite .",
    "all the computations presented in this paper were performed with @xmath48 .    in order to study the effect of spatial modulation ,",

    "the case of @xmath59 corresponds to the same wavepacket phases for all lattice sites , while the case of @xmath60 means the checkboard - like ordering of phases 0 and @xmath4 .",
    "the case of @xmath61 also means the checkboard sequence , but the sites with phases 0 and @xmath4 are separated by unoccupied sites . if the wavepacket width is sufficiently large , @xmath62 , the strongest spreading is expected in the absence of spatial modulation of the initial state , i.  e. for @xmath59 or @xmath63 , while the strongest spatial self - trapping is anticipated for @xmath61 or @xmath64 .",

    "the frequency offsets destroy the synchronization of rabi oscillations . as a consequence ,",
    "the resulting tpi oscillations become the superposition of many independent oscillations running inside individual lattice sites , and the maximal amplitude of tpi oscillations is significanltly lower than in the case of weak intra - component intercation .    however , if the intra - component interaction is not very strong , large fraction of the condensate near the center of the initial state can maintain synchronization , giving rise to a large domain with coherent rabi dynamics .",

    "the marked common feature is the presence of the limit cycle whose phase space location is nearly the same for all synchronized sites .",

    "however , the role of dissipation can be played by one - way energy transfer between degrees of freedom . in our case ,",
    "energy from the internal degree of freedom , associated with the rabi coupling , is absorbed by the external degrees of freedom , namely spatial wavepacket motion and intra - component interaction .",
    "hence , there arises synchronization inherent of non - hamiltonian systems .",

    "internal self - trapping is linked to the bifurcation of fixed points according to the scenario described in section [ uncoupled ] .",

    "the main goal is to describe the interplay between spatial and internal degrees of freedom .",
    "it is found that spatial mixture dynamics is readily controlled by the interaction strength and phase configuration of the initial state , i.  e. likewise in the case of one - component condensate @xcite . if condensate undergoes fragmentation with occurrence of localized and isolated patterns like solitons or breathers , then the total population imbalance is superposition of incoherent rabi oscillations with different amplitudes and frequencies .",
    "as the intra - component interaction energy exceeds some threshold , then rabi oscillations corresponding to distinct localized patterns cease , that is , these patterns become immiscible solitons comprising only one component of the mixture . in this case",
    "one observes simultaneously spatial and internal self - trapping .",
    "it should be mentioned that formation of immiscible solitons is preceded by a short chaotic transient and can be regarded as some kind of self - organization .    in the case of the initial state without spatial modulation ,",
    "rabi oscillations corresponding to different lattice sites can be synchronized . if the intra - component interaction is weak , the synchronization is total and the condensate undergoes rabi oscillations as a whole . in the case of moderate intra - component interactions ,",
    "rabi oscillations at different sites have different frequencies , therefore total synchronization is destroyed .",
    "however , there can arise spontaneous synchronization inside a large lattice domain .",

    "<S> the condensate is loaded into the optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we invoke the tight - binding approximation and examine the interplay of spatial and internal dynamics of the mixture . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that internal dynamics qualitatively depends on the intra - component interaction strength and the phase configuration of the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> we focus attention on two intriguing phenomena occurring for certain parameter values . </S>",
    "<S> the first phenomenon is the spontaneous synchronization of rabi oscillations running inside neighbouring lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> another one is the demixing of the condensate with formation of immiscible solitons when nonlinearity becomes sufficiently strong . </S>",
    "<S> demixing is preceded by the transient regime with highly irregular behavior of the mixture .    </S>",
