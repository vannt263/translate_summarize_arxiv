    "the structure and dynamics of liquid surfaces and interfaces has attracted much attention since the work of van der waals @xcite .",
    "the distinctive property of liquid surfaces is a logarithmic divergence with distance of the roughness , only limited by gravity or the finite size of the surface .",
    "this behavior is well described by the capillary wave model of buff , lovett and stillinger @xcite which yields a height - height correlation function : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the vector joining two points in the plane of the surface , @xmath5 is the surface tension , and @xmath6 the difference in density between the two phases separated by the interface .",
    "@xmath7 is the modified bessel function of second kind of order 0 : @xmath8 .",
    "this height - height correlation function is the fourier transform of the following spectrum : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the interface area .",
    "this spectrum has been well characterized for many liquid surfaces by light scattering down to wave - lengths in the micrometer range @xcite and is valid is the limit of small in - plane momentum @xmath11 .",
    "the question of higher order corrections in the denominator expressing the cost in free energy related to the curvature is still open @xcite .",
    "+ curvature effects become much more dramatic when an amphiphilic film is present at the interface because such a film may exhibit a large bending stiffness and also decreases the surface tension . in microemulsions , for instance , surface tensions as low as @xmath12 can be achieved , and curvature effects are dominant . the simplest phenomemological model due to helfrich @xcite then predicts an additional @xmath13 term in the denominator of eq .",
    "[ spectrum ] . the bending rigidity",
    "@xmath14 will therefore become important in limiting the out - of - plane fluctuations only at scales smaller than @xmath15 , typically in the nanometer range for films spread at the air - water interface .",
    "a comprehensive understanding of the bending rigidity in terms of molecular order and chain conformations is still lacking .",
    "this is a central problem in soft condensed matter physics where systems are often composed of films ( monolayers or bilayers ) and the role of fluctuations is dominant .",
    "the range of situations where the helfrich hamiltonian can be applied is also an open question from an experimental point - of - view .",
    "indeed , the coupling of the out - of - plane fluctuations with the fluctuation modes of any quantity of suitable symmetry may modify the energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of a tethered membrane having the elasticity of a solid , there can be a coupling between out - of - plane fluctuations and in - plane modes due to the fact that many configurations of the film with low bending energy _ per se _",
    "imply stretching .",
    "this leads to a divergence of @xmath16 at large scale , or a rigidity term in the spectrum proportional to @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "another interesting case is that of polarization for dipoles normal to the surface , always carried by classical amphiphiles , which leads to a non - trivial @xmath18 dependence@xcite .",
    "the examples cited in this introduction indicate that the key problems in liquid interfaces quite generally occur at very small length - scales .",
    "the many powerful techniques used to investigate solid surfaces generally require ultra - high vacuum and can not be applied to the study of liquid surfaces .",
    "the scattering of short wave - length radiation ( x - rays or neutrons ) thus provides unique information . the first reflectivity experiments on liquid surfaces were carried out on liquid metals @xcite in the 70 s and the roughness of the free surface of water was demonstrated to be consistent with the capillary wave model in the mid 80 s @xcite . in reflectivity studies however , only density profiles averaged over the surface can be measured . from the beginning of the 90 s",
    ", the analysis of diffuse scattering from the surface , which gives access to the roughness spectrum has been undertaken@xcite",
    ". the spectrum could be measured up to wave - vectors of the order of @xmath19 .",
    "the method has been more recently extended down to molecular length - scales giving access to new phenomena @xcite .",
    "after a short presentation of the method we discuss the results concerning the bare water surface and give some examples for surfactant monolayers .",
    "langmuir films ( monolayers of insoluble amphiphiles at the air / water interface ) offer the possibility of measuring the fluctuation spectra of oriented films with a well characterized structure .",
    "temperature , molecular area or surface tension can indeed be fixed , the structure can be determined by grazing incidence x - ray diffraction and reflectivity , and the texture observed _ in situ _ by brewster angle microscopy or by atomic force microscopy ( on transfered films ) . in this paper , we present direct measurements of the fluctuation spectra by grazing - incidence diffuse x - ray scattering @xcite .",
    "+ in a langmuir film , the scattering of x - rays results from height fluctuations of the different interfaces ( air / chain , chain / head , head / subphase ) , assumed in this study to fluctuate conformally .",
    "the interferences between beams scattered at the different interfaces , which can be accounted for within the distorted wave born approximation taking into account refraction and absorption @xcite , give rise to the normal @xmath20 dependence .",
    "the @xmath21 dependence of the scattered intensity is concentrated in the form : @xmath22e^{i(q_xx+q_yy)}\\tilde r(x , y)$ ] , where @xmath23 is the fourier transform of the resolution function . for small @xmath20 , the exponential",
    "can be developped and one simply gets the convolution of the roughness spectrum @xmath24 with the resolution function .",
    "+ the measurements were performed at the `` troka '' and `` crg - if '' beamlines of the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) .",
    "two types of experimental configurations were used ( fig.[troika ] ) . at the troika beamline ( undulator )",
    "the desired radiation was selected using the ( 111 ) reflection of a diamond monochromator in a laue geometry .",
    "a sic mirror was used in the monochromatic beam in order to fix the grazing angle of incidence and eliminate higher order light . at the crg - if beamline ( bending magnet ) a double si(111 ) monochromator and a platinum coated glass mirror are used . in both cases , the intensity of the @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) beam was approximately @xmath27",
    "the two beamlines differ notably for these experiments in the horizontal divergence of the synchrotron x - ray beam at the sample .",
    "a home - made langmuir trough was mounted on a nanofilm technologie gmbh active vibration isolation system on the sample stage of the diffractometer .",
    "since the signal scattered by the interfacial fluctuations at large in - plane wave - vectors @xmath28 is very low ( @xmath29 of the incident beam ) , extreme care was taken to limit the background by shielding of the experimental device and by a flux of he gas in the langmuir trough .",
    "another very important requirement is to fix the grazing angle of incidence below the critical angle for total external reflection in order to limit the penetration and therefore scattering in the bulk . under total external reflection conditions",
    "the background could be measured by simply lowering the trough by @xmath30 and scanning around the direct beam .",
    "the first type of experiments consisted of @xmath31 detector scans in the plane of incidence with a fixed angle of incidence @xmath32 ( see fig.[troika]a ) . with this geometry",
    "both @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\pi q_x / \\lambda}$ ] are varied jointly in an experiment . in a second type of experiments ( fig.[troika]b ) we measured the scattered intensity in the @xmath35 direction ,",
    "i.e. without any coupling to the vertical structure .",
    "intensity was collected using a nai(tl ) scintillator in the first configuration and a gas - filled ( xenon ) position sensitive detector ( psd ) in the second configuration .",
    "the intensity scattered by the bare water free surface ( from a millipore purification system ) is presented in ( fig.[wasser ] ) for both experimental configurations . in this case",
    "the scattered intensity can be calculated without _ any _ adjustable parameter : the surface tension @xmath36 is known , as well as the different parameters determining the resolution of the experiment ( slit dimensions , incident and accepted beam footprints ) .",
    "the intensity scattered in the plane of incidence is presented in fig.[wasser]a .",
    "the data extend to @xmath37 and are well described by the spectrum of eq.[spectrum ] .",
    "the data taken in the interface plane ( @xmath35 ) extend to even larger wave - vector ( @xmath38 , note that this is more than two orders of magnitude than that of the best previous measurements @xcite ) but can only be described with the spectrum of eq.[spectrum ] up to @xmath39 .",
    "the excess scattering at @xmath40 indicates either a smaller effective surface tension at such large wave - lengths @xcite or another source of scattering . because this scattering seems to have no dependence on @xmath41 ( the apparent @xmath42 dependence on fig.[wasser ] is due to the resolution function )",
    ", it can be due to acoustic waves within the penetration depth of the beam .",
    "the corresponding scattering cross - section @xcite can be calculated from the density - density correlation function at or near the interface which can itself be determined by using the linear response theory @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the refraction index of water , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the transmission coefficients of the air / water interface for the incident and scattering beams , @xmath47 is the isothermal compressibility of water ( @xmath48 ) , and @xmath49 is the imaginary part of the normal component of the wave - vector transfer ( inverse of the penetration length ) . including this contribution gives a better agreement ( fig.[wasser]b ) , without discarding the possibility of other corrections .",
    "when a surfactant monolayer is present at the interface , its first effect is to reduce the surface tension : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the surface pressure , as illustrated in fig.[scale ] for an arachidic acid ( @xmath52 ) film .",
    "higher order corrections to the spectrum , i.e. effects of the bending stiffness of the film are also evidenced .",
    "results for a l@xmath53 di - palmitoylphosphatidylcholine ( dppc ) film on pure water are presented in fig.[dppc ] . whereas at small @xmath35 values the scattered intensity scales with the surface tension as expected , this is no longer true at large @xmath35 due to the effect of bending stiffness .",
    "we have analysed the data of fig.[dppc ] using the spectrum eq.[spectrum ] plus an additional term @xmath13 in the denominator . for the more compressed film of fig.[dppc ]",
    "we find @xmath54 , smaller than generally expected in condensed dppc films @xcite , but consistent with a nave estimation relying on the theory of the elasticity of solid shells : @xmath55 with @xmath56 @xcite , the inverse of the compressibility of the film of thickness @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the observed wave - vector range is not large enough to allow the precise determination on the exponent @xmath58 .",
    "+ we have observed exponents smaller than @xmath58 in the case of the very rigid films@xcite formed by fatty acids ( here behenic acid @xmath59 ) on divalent cation subphases ( @xmath60 @xmath61 ) at high ph ( @xmath62 ) and low temperature ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "uncompressed , such films exhibit a @xmath64 power law which could be due to the coupling between in - plane ( phonons ) and out - of - plane elasticity @xcite . under compression ,",
    "those rigid films buckle in the third dimension as shown on fig.[cd ] .",
    "the film is homogeneous at scales @xmath65 , and the only possible source of scattering ( i.e. refractive index inhomogeneities ) are indeed surface corrugations . as shown in fig.[cd ] , the buckling wave - length @xmath66 changes only slightly under compression , but the amplitude strongly increases .",
    "this buckling could be induced by the asymmetry in packing constraints for headgroups and aliphatic chains , like in the ripple phase of lyotropic liquid crystals @xcite where similar periods are observed .",
    "the buckling wave - length ( fig . [ cd ] ) could result from a balance between the headgroup size inducing spontaneous curvature , the chain length that would limit the possible curvature , surface tension and the energy cost of defects . +",
    "in conclusion , the possibility of measuring height fluctuation spectra of liquid - gas interfaces down to molecular scales , thus enabling the determination of exponents and bending constants by means of x - ray surface scattering has been demonstrated . we are currently extending this method for measurements of films at liquid - liquid interfaces .",
