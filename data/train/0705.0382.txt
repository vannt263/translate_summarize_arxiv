    "this can be seen most clearly when one considers the dynamical evolution of a heavy ion collision .",

    "hard processes probe the very earliest phase of the collision process via the production of jets , photons , and heavy quark states from parton - parton interactions  @xcite . through the use of these calibrated probes",

    "finally , the study of integrated yields and the comparison of different hadron species and their decays gives a handle on the thermal and statistical properties of the system @xcite .",
    "the suite of collision systems ( p+p , a+a , p+a ) and detectors ( alice , atlas , and cms ) at the lhc are ideally suited to address all of the above theoretical questions via precise experimental measurements using phenomenological tools developed in the context of rhic collisions  @xcite .",
    "here we discuss the progress of the atlas heavy ion effort to ready itself for pb+pb running in late 2008 or early 2009 .",

    "the atlas detector is a powerful tool for studying the high multiplicity of particles that emerge from the collision of protons and nuclei  @xcite .",
    "a particular strength of the atlas detector is the hermetic liquid argon ( lar ) electromagnetic ( em ) calorimeter , which provides excellent energy and position information on electrons and photons via its longitudinally - segmented towers  @xcite .",

    "the electromagnetic calorimeter covers @xmath6 with angular resolution depending on the layer ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the barrel hadronic tile calorimeter covers ( @xmath8 ) with towers of @xmath9 . in the forward direction , the hadronic forward calorimeter has cells up to @xmath10 , and a forward lar calorimeter covers up to @xmath11 with cells of @xmath10 .",
    "additional detectors will extend the atlas acceptance farther into the forward region .",
    "the lucid gas cerenkov detector  @xcite detects primary charged particle from @xmath12 .",
    "while it will be primarily purposed for luminosity monitoring , it should also provide a measure of forward particle yields with a readout system that can resolve multiple particles per tube .",
    "more importantly for heavy ion physics is the zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) being designed and built especially for atlas by a consortium of us groups  @xcite .",
    "this detector will be able to detect forward neutron spectator fragments , which serves as both a high - purity event trigger as well as an estimator for the `` centrality '' of the collision ( related directly to the impact parameter )",
    ". however , its highly - segmented front em section will also be able to measure the angle of neutral clusters .",

    "the most pressing issue for the early days at the lhc is to establish the global features of heavy ion collisions .",
    "this involves the estimation of the inclusive charged - particle yield , both integrated and as a function of pseudorapidity , to get a handle on the initial - state entropy production which controls the hydrodynamic evolution as well as jet quenching  @xcite .",
    "it also entails studying the elliptic flow for inclusive particles as a function of centrality , @xmath5 and pseudorapidity  @xcite .",
    "one of the major questions for the lhc heavy ion program is whether the presumed `` hydro limit '' has really been reached in rhic collisions , or if the magnitude of elliptic flow scaled by the eccentricity ( @xmath14 ) will continue to increase with particle yield .    estimating the particle density can be done in a variety of ways .",
    "even before the tracking system is fully commissioned , a reasonably - aligned pixel detector can be used to measure particle yields by the `` tracklet '' technique pioneered at rhic by the phobos experiment  @xcite .",
    "this technique involves matching the angles of two pixel space points with the estimated event vertex measured using the rest of the inner detector .",
    "while it is not as robust as the full tracking procedure , it has a lower intrinsic @xmath5 cutoff and thus offers quick access to the full yield .",
    "initial studies of tracklets with full simulations , shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tracklets ] , show a good efficiency which is constant over a wide range of multiplicities emitted in @xmath15",
    ". of course the full inner detector will be indispensible for estimating particle yields and spectra .",

    ", it is typically assumed that the full event sees the same reaction plane and the formula @xmath26 \\rangle } $ ] is used to estimate the reaction plane resolution by the measurement of two symmetric subevents , one in the forward hemiphere and the other in the backward hemisphere .",
    "[ fig : reso ] shows the ideal and subevent reaction plane resolution as a function of impact parameter and subdetector , each of which cover a different pseudorapidity region .",
    "the resolutions are typically near 1 for most of the inelastic cross section .",
    "even for the most challenging environments , e.g. peripheral collisions with low multiplicity and central collisions with a low @xmath20 signal , they are always above 0.3 .",
    "these high resolutions provide a major advance over rhic measurements which had reaction plane resolutions typically _ below _ 0.5  @xcite .",
    "the detailed study of fully - reconstructed jets will be the major contribution of the lhc to the understanding of the strongly - interacting qgp thought to be formed in heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "both the copious production of jets and the experimental acceptance are unprecedented in the study of relativistic heavy ions  @xcite .",
    "the rates of hard processes in @xmath27 and @xmath28 collisions will increase dramatically relative to rhic energies . of course , so will the yields of uncorrelated soft particles , which may well suffer enormous fluctuations if copious minijet production indeed dominates the bulk particle production .",
    "thus , it is essential to have a calorimeter with a large acceptance in @xmath3 and @xmath4 with excellent energy and position resolution , to contain full jet , dijet , @xmath29-jet and @xmath30-jet events .",
    "combining information from the different measurements will provide a good handle on the jet @xmath31 scale ( e.g. from @xmath29-jet and @xmath30-jet event ) and fragmentation properties .",

    "this average energy is subtracted and then the standard atlas jet reconstruction algorithms are run on the modified towers .",
    "this allows heavy ion data analysis to take advantage of progress with jet reconstruction algorithms and calibration .",
    "the current results , applying the subtraction technique and the standard atlas jet reconstruction algorithms down to 50 gev , are shown in fig.[fig : energyres ] for jets ranging from @xmath32 gev and resolutions range from @xmath33 at the lowest energies considered to @xmath34 at higher energies .",

    "while these algorithms are typically @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is the number of tracks or calorimeter clusters ) , cacciari and salam have used the technique of voronoi diagrams to reduce the problem to @xmath41 .",
