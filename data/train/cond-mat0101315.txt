    "crystal growth , particularly high - quality epitaxial thin film growth , is one of the most fundamental processes impacting today s technology @xcite .",
    "a major issue in interface growth experiments is to have continuous dynamical control over the deposition process , such that interfaces with certain desired patterns can be obtained .",
    "for example , while in thin film epitaxy it is desirable to obtain smooth surfaces , in nanotechnology it is also important to be able to create regular , nanoscale structures with well defined geometry , such as quantum dots , quantum wires , etc",
    ". growth is usually achieved by vapor deposition of atoms from a molecular beam ( molecular beam epitaxy , or mbe ) .",
    "thus , in order to be able to design a controlled deposition process , it is of crucial importance to understand _ all _ the instability types ( which destroy controllability ) that may occur during growth . in the present paper",
    "we concentrate on mbe growth .",
    "there are several types of instabilities in mbe among which we mention the ehrlich - schwoebel ( es ) @xcite instability which is of kinetic - energetic type .",
    "ehrlich - schwoebel ( es ) barriers in the lattice potential induce an instability by hindering step - edge atoms on upper terraces from going down to lower terraces @xcite which in turn can generate mounded structures during growth .",
    "the es instability is thought to be an ubiquitous phenomenon in real surface deposition processes , and as such , is widely considered to be the only mechanism for formation of mounds in surface growth .",
    "another kinetic - energetic instability , which does not involve any explicit es barriers , was discussed by amar and family @xcite .",
    "this instability involves a negative barrier at the base of a step , and thus is due to a short range _ attraction _ between adatoms and islands .",
    "short range attractions generically lead to clustering in multiparticle systems , a property which in the language of mbe translates into formation of mounds .",
    "note that this attraction - induced instability and es instability are essentially equivalent , and both could occur in d=1 + 1 or 2 + 1 dimensions . both the attractive instability and the es barrier instability cause mounding because atoms on terraces preferentially collect at up - steps rather than down - steps leading to the mounded morphology . in both cases , there is no explicit stabilizing mechanism , and the mounds should progressively stiffen with time leading to mounded growth morphology with no slope selection , where the mound slopes continue to increase as growth progresses .",
    "it is , of course , possible to stop the monotonic slope increase by incorporating some additional mechanisms ( e.g. the so - called `` downward funneling '' where deposited atoms funnel downwards before incorporation ) which produce a downhill mass current on the surface and thereby opposes the uphill current created by the es barrier .",
    "there is , however , no intrinsic slope selection process built in the es barrier mechanism itself .",
    "= 3.6 in    the purpose of the current article is to discuss a completely different _ kinetic - topological _ mechanism , qualitatively distinct from the es barrier induced mounding , which leads to spectacular mound formation ( see fig .",
    "[ color ] for a colorful example ) in mbe growth without involving any es barriers ( or the closely related island - adatom attraction mechanism ) whatsoever . based on the direct stochastic numerical simulations of a large number of mbe - related nonequilibrium limited mobility solid - on - solid epitaxial growth models studied in this paper we believe that epitaxial mounding of the type discussed here is quite generic , and may actually apply to a variety of experimental situations where mounded growth morphologies ( with slope selection ) have been observed .",
    "the mechanism underlying the mounding instability discussed in this paper is closely related to that proposed in two recent publications @xcite although its widespread applicability to well - known limited mobility mbe growth models , as described here , has not earlier been appreciated in the literature . the mounding instability discussed in this paper , being topological in nature , can happen only on physical two - dimensional surfaces ( d=2 + 1 dimensions growth ) or in ( unphysical ) higher ( d@xmath02 + 1 ) dimensional systems , in contrast to es type instabilities which , being of energetic origin , are allowed in all dimensions .",
    "the instability most recently discovered by pierre - louis , dorsogna , and einstein @xcite , and independently by ramana murty and copper @xcite is entirely different from es instabilities , because it is _ not _ of kinetic - energetic nature ( involving potential barriers ) but rather of a kinetic-_topologic _ nature .",
    "this instability is generated by strong diffusion along the edges of monoatomic steps , and its net effect in two or higher dimensions is to create quasi - regular shaped mounds on the substrate ( see fig .",
    "[ color ] ) . for simplicity of formulation we will call this instability the step - edge diffusion , or sed instability .",
    "what comes as a bit of a surprise is that in spite of its simplicity as a mechanism , it has not apparently been recognized that the sed mechanism may actually be playing a dominant role in many epitaxial mounding instabilities .",
    "there are two reasons for this , one is probably because the es instability has inadvertently and tacitly been accepted as the only mechanism for mounding , and therefore the mounded surface morphologies coming from experiments have been _ apriori _ analyzed with the es mechanism in mind , and the second reason is that sed is not easy to see in simulations unless other conditions ( related to reduced noise ) are met in addition to the existence of edge - current , which we will discuss in details in the present paper .    in this paper we discuss the sed instability , and analyze its effects on various growth models , giving both a simple continuum and discrete description .",
    "the sed is shown to exist in a large number of discrete , limited mobility growth models , and we identify the conditions under which sed - induced epitaxial mounding is manifested .",
    "we study the instability by producing dynamical growth morphologies through direct numerical simulations and by analyzing the measured height - height correlation functions @xcite of the simulated morphologies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we define a number of limited mobility growth models ( subsection ii.a ) studied here , we briefly review the noise reduction technique ( subsection ii.b ) , then present a series of simulated growth morphologies , both from early and late times , with and without noise reduction ( subsection ii.c ) ; in section iii we describe and discuss the sed mechanism , by first presenting a continuum description in terms of local currents ( subsection iii.a ) and its discrete counterpart with particular emphasis on the wolf - villain and das sarma - tamborenea models ( subsection iii.b ) ; in subsection iii.c we introduce the notion of conditional site occupation rates to analyze the effects of noise reduction ; section iv is devoted to the properties of the mounded morphologies with the emphasis on the relevance of the height - height correlation function ( subsection iv.a ) , where we note possible comparison with experiments and discuss the relevance of the global diffusion current in the simulations for the mounding instability .",
    "all the models studied here are dynamical limited mobility growth models in which an adatom is allowed to diffuse ( according to specific sets of diffusion rules for each model ) within a finite diffusion length of @xmath1 sites .",
    "the diffusion process is instantaneous and once the adatom has found its final site , it is incorporated permanently into the substrate and can no longer move .",
    "these models are also based on the solid - on - solid ( sos ) constraint where bulk vacancies and overhangs are not allowed .",
    "desorption from the growth front is neglected .",

    ", an adatom is randomly dropped on an initially flat substrate .",

    "where there is no neighbor with higher coordination number , the adatom will remain at the deposition site . at the end of the diffusion process ,",
    "the adatom becomes part of the substrate and the next adatom is deposited .",
    "it is important to note that adatoms in the dt model search for final sites with higher coordination numbers compared to the deposition site .",
    "the final sites are not necessarily the local sites with maximum coordination numbers . in other words , in the dt model adatoms try to _ increase _ , but not necessarily _ maximize _ , the local coordination number .",

    "= 2.3 in     +    = 2.3 in      the wolf - villain ( wv ) model @xcite is very similar to the dt model in the sense that diffusion is controlled by the local coordination number .",
    "there are , however , two important distinctions between the two models . for one thing , in the wv model , an adatom with lateral nearest neighbors can still diffuse if it can find a final site with higher coordination number .",
    "the other difference is that , adatoms in the wv model try to _ maximize _ the coordination number , and not just to _ increase _ it as in the dt model ( see fig .",

    ". this regular re - arrangement of the mound morphology , caused by longer diffusion lengths as well as the different symmetry properties ( 110 versus 100 ) of the equal priority and higher priority lc models , show the extreme sensitivity of the epitaxial mound morphology to the details of the diffusion process controlling growth  in general , we find the sed instability in all our simple models to be quite complex in the sense of the mound patterns ( and even whether mounds exist or not as in wv and dt models ) seem to be very sensitive to the details of the surface diffusion rules .",
    "it has been recently recognized @xcite that step - edge diffusion generates a local _ uphill _ surface diffusion current during the deposition process , leading to a morphological `` instability '' , i.e. the starting substrate is no longer stable after growth .",

    "@xcite ) that is needed for the formation of quasi - regular mounded growth patterns in addition to the destabilizing sed currents : _ suppression of deposition and nucleation noise_. in order to have a consistent uphill current build - up ( to create mounds ) , we need a sustained stability of the step - edge , in other words , if we look at the step - edge as a 1 + 1 dimensional ` surface ' in the @xmath118 plane ( the upper terrace being the ` substrate ' ) we need to have more or less a solid - on - solid type of step - edge , with perhaps some small overhangs eventually , but no large or frequent ones . the only effect which can disrupt a stable step - edge",

    "let us imagine that we start with a straight step , aligned along the most stable direction .",

    "if the relaxation time of the disrupted contour is larger than the nucleation time , small newly grown islands will disrupt the step even further until it ceases to exist .",
    "in this case the sed instability _ will not _ manifest in the mound formation because the necessary condition for mound formation is not satisfied globally although there may be local uphill current .",

    "thus , the dt model , at best , will exhibit some weak and irregular epitaxial mounding @xcite , but _ not _ a regular patterned mounded morphology .",
    "another important point is that mounding due to the sed instability _ does not require any growth nonlinearity to be present_. this is obvious from the fact that the lc model , which is strictly linear by construction , shows spetacular epitaxial mounding induced by the sed instability . in the following subsection",

    "for example , the one dimensional wv model will have conditional occupation rates from the set @xmath132 .",
    "for the one dimensional dt , the set is a bit restricted : @xmath133 , it does not allow for @xmath134 .",

    "the exact enumeration of these classes is highly non - trivial , and it constitutes the subject of a future publication .",
    "one can note the following property of conditional occupation rates : in every domain of sites on the substrate that has a zero inflow and zero outflow current across its boundaries ( ` island ' ) , the sum of the rates within the island adds up to the total number of sites within the island : @xmath139 this is a consequence of conservation of probability . the span of the island may only change if a new particle is deposited within a distance @xmath128 from its boundary , outward from the island .",

    "stable _ surface that belongs asymptotically to the ew universality class , and an _ uphill _ particle current will point to an _",
    "unstable _ surface ( i.e. mounded morphology ) @xcite .",
    "our particle current results , however , show that this concept may be misleading for growth in d=2 + 1 dimensional physical surfaces since the _ global _ current may show no simple systematic behavior as a function of tilt . in general ,",
    "substrate current in 2 + 1 dimensional growth may be positive or negative depending on tilt direction .",
    "in fact , we believe that the current measurement on tilted substrates is a useful technique for determining the universality class of growth models only in 1 + 1 dimensions . in 2 + 1 dimensions , where the surface current could be stabilizing in one direction ( e.g. 100 ) and destabilizing in another ( e.g. 111 ) , the technique fails .",
    "this was not appreciated in ref .",
    "@xcite and has not been earlier discussed in the literature .",
    "an important example is the particle current in the wv model in various dimensions .",
    "it was reported @xcite that the wv model has downhill current in both one and two dimensions .",
    "this implies that the wv model belongs to the ew universality class , which was the conclusion in ref .",
    "however , our fig . [ wvsur ] shows that the two dimensional version of the wv model has mounded morphology induced by an sed instability .",
    "this seems confusing as mound morphology should have uphill current .",
    "we repeated the particle current study on the two dimensional wv model and found the same downhill current as in the literature @xcite , both in the original wv model with @xmath45 and in the @xmath46 wv model .",
    "but all the global particle current measurements in the literature were obtained @xcite by tilting the substrate in the ( 100 ) direction ! we have also studied the diffusion current by tilting the substrate along the diagonal , i.e. in the ( 111 ) direction , and found a completely different result .",
    "the wv current from the ( 111 ) tilted substrate is _ uphill _ ( positive ) . in the @xmath45 model ,",
    "the ( 111 ) current starts out as uphill and then crosses over to a negative value , i.e. , downhill with crossover time increasing with increasing substrate size @xmath190 .",
    "this is already a weak indication that there are some instabilities present . in the @xmath50 wv model ,",
    "however , we measure strong ( 111 ) uphill current which stays positive up to @xmath47 ml which is our longest simulation time , confirming the suspicion that in fact the wv model in two dimensions has the sed mounding instability induced by ( 111 ) uphill current , and a simple measurement of ( 100 ) downhill current gives a qualitatively incorrect result .",
    "our result shows that the global particle current strongly depends on how the substrate is tilted .",
    "this tilt direction ( e.g. 100 versus 111 ) dependence may be very complicated in systems with two or higher dimensional substrates since surface current is a vectorial quantity in 2 ( or higher ) substrate dimensions .",
    "the particle current from one particular tilt may be highly misleading with respect to the overall behavior of the system .",
    "the downhill ( 100 ) current in the wv model had incorrectly suggested that the model belongs to the ew universality class and should exhibit relatively flat morphology in two dimensions .",
    "however , by properly suppressing the noise our study shows that the two dimensional wv model actually becomes unstable due to a strong sed driven uphill ( 111 ) current . as a matter of fact",
    ", there has been at least one prior report of mounding in the wv model in unphysical higher dimensions ( three and four dimensional substrates ) @xcite . in higher substrate dimensions",
    "the noise effects are intrinsically a lot weaker than in one or two substrate dimensions , because diffusion in lower dimensional substrates is topologicaly more constrained , and therefore the sed instability is easier to observe ( even without noise reduction ) in higher dimensions .",
    "we have explicitly verified through direct numerical simulations that higher ( 3 + 1 and 4 + 1 ) dimensional wv growth has spectacular sed instability - induced mound formation even in the absence of any noise reduction , thus verifying the old and unexplained results of ref .",
    "the higher dimensional dt growth is smooth and flat , and exhibits no such mounding .",
    "this arises from the much stronger edge diffusion effects in higher dimensions which effectively introduces very strong intrinsic suppression of noise .",
    "our work therefore resolves an old puzzle , explaining why the higher dimensional simulations @xcite of the wv model produced mounded morphologies .",
    "we have shown that one has to carefully account for subtle topological - kinetic instabilities when trying to understand mounding in the surface growth process .",
    "these instabilities are simply the result of the fact that in higher ( higher than 1 + 1 ) dimensions a local current may act as a stabilizing one in a certain projection on the substrate and as a destabilizing one in another projection .",
    "the local anisotropy of current effects averaged over the whole substrate may generate mounded growth even in situations ( e.g. wv model ) where mounding is completely unanticipated .",
    "the situations where sed instabilities may be present are rather subtle to analyze and each case has to be investigated rather carefully using the noise reduction technique .",
    "the fact that sed mounding instability exists in the noise reduced wv , lc , and the nonlinear fourth order continuum model , but not in f , dt , and the infinite order nonlinear model shows that the kinetic - topological nature of sed mounding may not be obvious at all in a given situation .",
    "we note here that the dt model also exhibits very weak mound - like morphologies @xcite",
    ". however , the weak mound - like structures in the dt model arise from the fact that the roughness exponent of the model is exceptionally large ( arising from the presence of the @xmath163 term in the growth equation ) .",
    "the mounds ( and the oscillation in the height correlation @xmath161 ) in the 2 + 1 dt model are random and irregular while the sed - induced mound formations ( in e.g. noise reduced wv model ) exhibit regular patterns with strong periodic oscillations in @xmath161 .",
    "one of our important findings is that sed generically leads to slope - selected mounded morphology whereas the es instability generically leads to slope steepening mounding .",
    "we believe that many of the slope selected mounding morphologies observed in mbe experiments ( with typical selected slopes being small @xmath191 or less ) may actually arise from the kinetic - topological mounding we find generically in the lc or the wv model in this paper .",
    "further experimental and theoretical work is required to settle the competing roles of various instabilities contributing to epitaxial mounding in real surface growth .",
