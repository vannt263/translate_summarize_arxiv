    "one deduces that @xmath142 iff @xmath143 , and the latter is true ( using the poisson condition ) iff @xmath114 ( and hence @xmath144 ) .",

    "for example , any `` associative belavin - drinfeld structure '' gives rise to a ( trigonometric ) such solution which additionally satisfies the qybe and cybe with spectral parameters .",
    "one may interpret a solution of the aybe and skew - symmetry ( unitarity ) with parameters as a sort of graded version of double lie algebra ; to make it poisson , one would need to find a compatible multiplication ( if it exists ) .",
    "we ask the question : is theorem [ thm1 ] a special property of lie algebras , or can it be generalized to other operads ( suitably replacing the cybe with other equations ) ? to make sense of this question , for any twisted - commutative algebra @xmath19 equipped with an additional binary operation @xmath148 , we generalize the leibniz rule to @xmath149 let @xmath150 be any operad generated by a single element @xmath151 . if @xmath19 as above is an @xmath150-algebra ( with @xmath152 ) satisfying , we call it a _ twisted distributive @xmath150-algebra_.    let @xmath153 be the operad freely generated by an element also denoted by @xmath154 . by a quadratic operad @xmath155 , we mean one such that @xmath156 , with @xmath157 and @xmath158 . in particular , the only possible relations from @xmath159 are symmetry conditions on @xmath160 , namely , that @xmath161 as elements of @xmath150 . also , @xmath162 consists of relations which are quadratic in @xmath160 .",

    "since @xmath10 is completely reducible over @xmath7 ( @xmath7 has characteristic zero ) , the above means that @xmath9 decomposes , as a @xmath10-representation , into a sum of the form @xmath360 where @xmath361 corresponds to the @xmath328-isotypical part of @xmath9 , with respect to the @xmath170-permutation action of @xmath10 , and @xmath362 has trivial @xmath10-action .",

    "the remaining statements are immediate , and the theorem is proved .    the first part of the above theorem , , is still true if the charactistic of @xmath7 is not zero , or if the condition on unitarity is dropped and @xmath10 is replaced by @xmath364 , both using the same proof as above .",
