    "the concept of groupoid is central in non commutative geometry .",
    "groupoids generalize the concepts of spaces , groups and equivalence relations .",
    "it is clear nowadays that groupoids are natural substitutes of singular spaces .",
    "many people have contributed to realizing this idea .",
    "we can find for instance a groupoid - like treatment in dixmier s works on transformation groups , @xcite , or in brown - green - rieffel s work on orbit classification of relations , @xcite .",
    "in foliation theory , several models for the leaf space of a foliation were realized using groupoids , mainly by people like haefliger ( @xcite ) and wilkelnkemper ( @xcite ) , for mention some of them .",
    "there is also the case of orbifolds , these can be seen indeed as tale groupoids , ( see for example moerdijk s paper @xcite ) .",
    "there are also some particular groupoid models for manifolds with corners and conic manifoldss worked by people like monthubert @xcite , debord - lescure - nistor ( @xcite ) and aastrup - melo - monthubert - schrohe ( @xcite ) for example .",
    "the way we treat  singular spaces  in non commutative geometry is by associating to them algebras . in the case",
    "when the  singular space  is represented by a lie groupoid , we can , for instance , consider the convolution algebra of differentiable functions with compact support over the groupoid ( see connes or paterson s books @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this last algebra plays the role of the algebra of smooth functions over the  singular space  represented by the groupoid . from the convolution algebra",
    "it is also possible to construct a @xmath1-algebra , @xmath2 , that plays , in some sense , the role of the algebra of continuous functions over the  singular space  .",
    "the idea of associating algebras in this sense can be traced back in works of dixmier ( @xcite ) for transformation groups , connes ( @xcite ) for foliations and renault ( @xcite ) for locally compact groupoids , for mention some of them .",
    "using methods of noncommutative geometry , we would like to get invariants of this algebras , and hence , of the spaces they represent .",
    "for that , connes showed that many groupoids and algebras associated to them appeared as ",
    "non commutative analogues ` of spaces to which many tools of geometry ( and topology ) such as k - theory and characteristic classes could be applied ( @xcite , @xcite ) . one classical way to obtain invariants in classical geometry ( topology ) , is through the index theory in the sense of atiyah - singer . in the lie groupoid case",
    ", there is a pseudodifferential calculus , developed by connes ( @xcite ) , monthubert - pierrot ( @xcite ) and nistor - weinstein - xu ( @xcite ) in general .",
    "some interesting particular cases were treated in the groupoid - spirit by melrose ( @xcite ) , moroianu ( @xcite ) and others ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath3 be a lie groupoid , there is an analytic index morphism , ( see @xcite ) , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the lie algebroid of @xmath6 .",
    "the `` @xmath1-index '' @xmath7 is a homotopy invariant of the @xmath6-pseudodifferential elliptic operators and has proved to be very useful in very different situations , ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for example ) .",
    "one way to define the above index map is using the connes ' tangent groupoid associated to @xmath6 as explained by hilsum and skandalis in @xcite or by monthubert and pierrot in @xcite .",
    "the tangent groupoid is a lie groupoid @xmath8\\ ] ] with @xmath9 $ ] and the groupoid structure is given by the groupoid structure of @xmath5 at @xmath10 and by the groupoid structure of @xmath6 for @xmath11 .",
    "one of the main features about the tangent groupoid is that its @xmath12algebra @xmath13 is a continuous field of @xmath12algebras over the closed interval @xmath0 $ ] , with associated fiber algebras    @xmath14 at @xmath10 , and    @xmath2 for @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , it gives a @xmath12algebraic quantization of the poisson manifold @xmath15 ( in the sense of @xcite ) , and this is the main point why it allows to define the index morphism as a sort of  deformation  .",
    "thus , the tangent groupoid construction has been very useful in index theory ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) but also for other purposes ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    now , to understand the purpose of the present work ,",
    "let us first say that the indices ( in the sense of atiyah - singer - connes ) have not necessarily to be considered as elements in @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , it is possible to consider indices in @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18-indices are more refined but they have several inconvenients ( see alain connes book section @xmath19 for a discussion on this matter ) , nevertheless this kind of indices have the great advantage that one can apply to them the existent tools ( such as pairings with cyclic cocycles or chern - connes character ) in order to obtain numerical invariants .    in this work",
    "we begin a study of more refined indices .",
    "in particular we are looking for indices between the @xmath18 and the @xmath1-levels ; trying to keep the advantages of both approaches ( see @xcite for a more complete discussion ) . in the case of lie groupoids",
    "this refinement could mean forget for a moment the powerful tools of the theory of @xmath1-algebras and instead , working in a purely algebraic and geometric level .",
    "in the present article , we construct an algebra of @xmath20 functions over @xmath21 , denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "this algebra is also a field of algebras over the closed interval @xmath0 $ ] , with associated fiber algebras ,    @xmath23 , at @xmath10 , and    @xmath24 for @xmath11 ,    where @xmath23 is the schwartz algebra of the lie algebroid .",
    "furthermore , we will have @xmath25 as inclusions of algebras .",
    "let us explain in some words why we define an algebra over the tangent groupoid such that in zero it is schwartz : the `` schwartz algebras '' have in general the good @xmath26theory groups .",
    "for example , we are interested in the symbols of @xmath6-pdo and more precisely in their homotopy classes in @xmath27-theory , that is , we are interested in the group @xmath28 . here",
    "it would not be enough to take the @xmath26theory of @xmath29 ( see the example in @xcite p.142 ) , however it is enough to consider the schwartz algebra @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , the fourier transform shows that this last algebra is stable under holomorphic calculus on @xmath14 and so it has the `` good '' @xmath27-theory , meaning that @xmath31 .",
    "none of the inclusions in ( [ incl ] ) is stable under holomorphic calculus , but that is precisely what we wanted because our algebra @xmath22 have the remarkable property that its evaluation at zero is stable under holomorphic calculus while its evaluation at one ( for example ) is not .",
    "the algebra @xmath22 is , as vector space , a particular case of a more general construction that we do for  deformation to the normal cone manifolds  from which the tangent groupoid is a special case ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a deformation to the normal cone manifold ( dnc for simplify ) is a manifold associated to an injective immersion @xmath32 that is considered as a sort of blow up in differential geometry .",
    "the construction of a dnc manifold has very nice functorial properties ( section [ dnc ] ) which we exploit to achieve our construction .",
    "we think that our construction could be used also for other purposes , for example , it seems that it could help to give more understanding in quantization theory ( see again @xcite ) .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "in the second section we recall the basic facts about lie groupoids .",
    "we explain very briefly how to define the convolution algebra @xmath24 . in the third section",
    "we explain the `` deformation to the normal cone '' construction associated to an injective immersion . even if this could be considered as classical material , we do it in some detail since we will use in the sequel very explicit descriptions that we could not find elsewhere .",
    "we also review some functorial properties associated to these deformations .",
    "a particular case of this construction is the tangent groupoid associated to a lie groupoid . in the fourth section we start by constructing a vector space @xmath33 for any deformation to the normal cone manifold @xmath34 ; this space already exhibits the characteristic of being a field of vector spaces over the closed interval @xmath0 $ ] , such that in zero we have a schwartz space while out of zero we have @xmath35 .",
    "we then define the algebra @xmath22 , the main result is precisely that the product is well defined .",
    "the last section is devoted to motivate the construction of our algebra by explaining in a few words some further developements that will immediately follow from this work .",
    "all the results of the present work are part of the author s phd thesis .",
    "let us recall what a groupoid is :    a @xmath36 consists of the following data : two sets @xmath6 and @xmath37 , and maps    * @xmath38 called the source and target map respectively , * @xmath39 called the product map ( where @xmath40 ) , * @xmath41 the unit map and * @xmath42 the inverse map    such that , if we note @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we have    * @xmath46 , @xmath47 when this is possible . * @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 . * @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 . * @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "generally , we denote a groupoid by @xmath3 where the parallel arrows are the source and target maps and the other maps are given .",
    "now , a lie groupoid is a groupoid in which every set and map appearing in the last definition is @xmath20 ( possibly with borders ) , and the source and target maps are submersions . for @xmath58 subsets of @xmath37",
    "we use the notation @xmath59 for the subset @xmath60 .    all along this paper",
    ", @xmath3 is going to be a lie groupoid .",
    "we recall how to define an algebra structure in @xmath61 using smooth haar systems .",
    "a @xmath62 over a lie groupoid consists of a family of measures @xmath63 in @xmath64 for each @xmath65 such that ,    * for @xmath66 we have the following compatibility condition : @xmath67 * for each @xmath68 the map @xmath69 belongs to @xmath70    a lie groupoid always posses a smooth haar system .",
    "in fact , if we fix a smooth ( positive ) section of the 1-density bundle associated to the lie algebroid we obtain a smooth haar system in a canonical way .",
    "the advantage of using 1-densities is that the measures are locally equivalent to the lebesgue measure .",
    "we suppose for the rest of the paper a given smooth haar system given by 1-densities ( for complete details see @xcite ) .",
    "we can now define a convolution product on @xmath61 : let @xmath71 , we set @xmath72 this gives a well defined associative product .",
    "there is a way to avoid the haar system when one works with lie groupoids , using half densities ( see connes book @xcite ) .",

    "the index defined at the @xmath1-level has proven to be very useful ( see for example @xcite ) but extracting numerical invariants from it , with the existent tools , is very difficult . in non commutative geometry , and also in classical geometry , the tools for obtain more explicit invariants are more developed for the smooth objects ; in our case this means the convolution algebra @xmath24 , where we can for example apply chern - weil - connes theory . hence , in some way , the indices defined in @xmath397 are more refined objects and for some cases it would be preferable to work with them .",
    "unfortunately this indices are not good enough , since for example they are not homotopy invariants ; in @xcite alain connes discusses this and also other reasons why it is not enough to keep with the @xmath18-indices .",
    "the main reason to construct the algebra @xmath398 is that it gives an intermediate way between the @xmath18-level and the @xmath1-level and will allow us in @xcite to define another analytic index morphism associated to the groupoid , with the advantage that this index will take values in a group that allows to do pairings with cyclic cocycles and in general to apply chern - connes theory to it .",
    "the way we are going to define our index is by obtaining first a short exact sequence analogue to ( [ se * ] ) , that is , a sequence of the following kind @xmath399 the problem here will be that we do not dispose of the advantages of the @xmath26theory for @xmath1-algebras , since the algebras we are considering are not of this type ( we do not have for example homotopy invariance ) .",
