    "rotation is a very universal phenomenon in nature .",
    "we can observe rotating objects at all scales of the universe , from the elementary particles to planets , stars and galaxies .",
    "the question is , whether this property is an attribute of the whole universe at a very large scale structure . on the other hand ,",
    "if our universe does not rotate , then the question is why and how does this happen ?",
    "since rotation is generic in the universe , the possible rotation of the universe can not be excluded at the very beginning .",
    "moreover , we should explain the physical mechanism which prevents universal rotation of the universe @xcite .    of course , if the universe rotate , then there should exist some observational manifestations of this global rotation .",
    "following the standard approach we can study the motion of test particles and photons on the background of corresponding spacetimes which admit the rotation .",
    "our idea is to test the effects of rotation by classical cosmological tests like luminosity distance or angular size of radiogalaxies .    since the work of lanczos @xcite , gamov @xcite , goedel @xcite , and hawking @xcite , the cosmological models with rotation have been studied as well as the behavior of geodesics in such spacetimes .",
    "although the quite strong upper limits for cosmic vorticity were obtained from analysis of cmb or bbn @xcite all these works based on the model in which shear and vorticity effects are inseparable , i.e. , in the sense that zero shear automatically implies zero vorticity .",
    "therefore , the obtained limits actually placed not on the vorticity , but rather on the shear induced by it within the specific geometry of spacetime @xcite .",
    "finally , one thus needs a separate analysis of these limits in expanding cosmological models with trivial shear ( shear - free ) but non - zero rotation and expansion ( it is an idea of obukhov @xcite ) .",
    "principally , there are two classes of such models in which this analysis can be performed    1 .",
    "newtonian shear - free models so - called heckmann - schcking models @xcite ; 2 .",
    "general relativistic spatially homogeneous models with the geometry of the bianchi ix and the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "let us consider the first class of models .",
    "we have a homogeneous newtonian universe defined on product of the three - dimensional euclidean space and absolute time coordinate .",
    "this universe is homogeneous , density and pressure of the fluid have no spatial dependence and the velocity vector field depends linearly on spatial coordinate @xcite . in this case",
    "contrary to the general relativity theory there exist shear - free solutions which satisfy the heckmann - schcking equations and describe both expanding and rotating universes @xcite .",
    "the rotating homogeneous non - tilted universes when considered on a relativistic level filled with perfect fluid must have non - vanishing shear @xcite . therefore",
    ", it is very difficult to consider both effects of anisotropy and rotation , that s why we study the newtonian counterpart of model with rotation .",
    "moreover , it is reasonable to assume that the shear scalar is sufficiently small compared with angular velocity scalar since the shear falls off more rapidly than the rotation as the universe expands @xcite .    to compare the results of analysis of supernovae data with a general relativistic model we formally consider a non - flat model @xmath1 , although the satisfactory interpretation of @xmath2 can be found beyond newtonian cosmology in the general relativity .",
    "the motion of the fluid in a homogeneous newtonian universe is described by the scalar expansion @xmath3 , the rotation tensor @xmath4 , and the shear tensor @xmath5 .",
    "the homogeneous rotation of fluid as a whole is usually called the global rotation of the universe @xcite .",
    "the problem of the rotation of the whole universe attracted the attention of several scientists .",
    "it was shown , that the reported values are too big , when compared with the cmb anisotropy .",
    "silk @xcite pointed out that presently the dynamical effects of a general rotation of the universe are unimportant , contrary to the the early universe , when angular velocity @xmath6 rad / yr .",
    "he stressed that now the period of rotation must be greater than the hubble time , which is consequence of the cmb isotropy .",
    "barrow @xcite also addressed this question and showed that the cosmic vorticity depends strongly on the cosmological models and assumptions connected with linearisation of homogeneous , anisotropic cosmological models over the isotropic friedmann universe .",
    "for the flat universe they obtained the value ( @xmath7 .",
    "while the investigations of the cosmological models with global rotation has a long history , the global rotation of the universe is still not detectable by observation .",
    "some observational evidences for the global rotation of the universe have not been confirmed @xcite .",
    "the cosmological origin of the rotation of astronomical objects was analysed by filchenkov in the framework of quantum cosmology and tunnelling approach @xcite .",
    "the alignment of galaxies along the direction of the global rotation would also be some indication of the discussed phenomenon .",
    "however , the primordial dipole anisotropy of the distribution of rotation axes of galaxies is blurred due to the irregular shape of the protogalaxy , which can lead , after phase transition , to an almost random distribution .",
    "it is clear that the angular momentum of a structure is a sum of spins of components and its own angular momentum .",
    "a lot of work has been done in study of the alignment of galaxies in superclusters ( for review see @xcite ) . here , the result are ambiguous , but several independent investigations claimed the existence of the weak alignment of galaxies in respect to the supercluster main plane @xcite .",
    "independent observations of supernovae type ia ( snia ) have indicated that our universe presently accelerates @xcite .",
    "there is a fundamental problem for theoretical physics to explain the origin of this acceleration .",
    "one of the first explanations was the cosmological constant .",
    "it is also possible to introduce the global rotation as we do in the present paper .",
    "while such a possibility seems to be attractive in the context of the accelerating universe , the cosmological constant is still needed to explain snia data because the contribution to acceleration coming from the global rotation is too small @xcite .    in our previous papers we study some constraints on rotation coming from snia data , primordial nucleosynthesis as well as from the age of the oldest in the universe @xcite .",
    "the main aims of this paper is rather theoretical than empirical .",
    "we show that the analysis of the model dynamics is more effective after rewriting the basic equation to the new form with dimensionless quantities .",
    "then we obtain a two - dimensional dynamical system in which coefficients have a simple interpretation of a density parameter of fluid fulfilling the universe in the present epoch . in this approach dynamics",
    "is described by the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) model with some additional noninteracting fluid for which we can define density parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the presented formalism gives us also a natural base to discuss the influence of global rotation on acceleration of the universe . from the observational",
    "constrains it is possible to find a limit for the angular velocity of the universe .",
    "for example , ciufolini and wheeler @xcite obtained @xmath9 from the cmb limit for the homogeneous b(ix ) models with rotation . the limits for angular velocity of the universe obtained from the cmb and snia were also discussed @xcite .",
    "here we also investigate some dynamical effects of the global rotation on the solving classical problems in cosmology , namely the horizon , flatness and cosmological constant problems .",
    "organization of our paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present hamiltonian dynamics of the frw model with global rotation . in section 3",
    "we discuss some properties of exact solutions with rotation .",
    "in section 4 we discuss the domains of the phase plane for which the cosmic acceleration and horizon problem are solved . in section 5",
    "we construct the phase portraits for the frw model with rotation and dust ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we also investigate general properties of dynamics by showing that generally it can be reduced to the form of the frw models with non - interacting multifluid scaling like radiation . in section 6 a detailed analysis of dynamics on phase portrait",
    "is given in two dimensional phase plane . in section 7",
    "we discuss the flatness and cosmological constant problems in the context of model with rotation . in section 8 , it is proved ( without of any help of empirical evidence ) that formulae @xmath0 is exactly valid for the universe with dust ( @xmath10 ) . for proof we use the lie group theory of symmetry analysis of differential equations , describing the evolution of the universe .",
    "then the relation between angular momentum and mass becomes a constraint relation between invariants of a self similarity group of symmetry of the basic equations . in section 9",
    "we summarise obtained results .",
    "in this paper we adopt the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "it gives immediate insight into possible motion because the dynamical problem is analogous to that of a particle of unit mass moving in the one - dimension potential .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation describing the relation among scalar expansion @xmath11 , the rotation tensor @xmath4 and shear tensor @xmath5 ( if the acceleration vector @xmath12 vanishes , which would necessarily follow in the case of dust ) has the form @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the cosmological constant , @xmath17 is the gravitational constant , the fluid is perfect fluid with the stress - energy tensor @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the mass density and @xmath20 is its pressure ) .",
    "the shear scalar @xmath21 vanishes for the frw model , while for the anisotropic bianchi i or bianchi v model ( hereafter b(i ) and b(v ) ) it satisfies the following equation @xmath22 our aim is to consider the frw model and its generalisation ",
    "anisotropic b(i ) or b(v ) models with global rotation . in the anisotropic generalization",
    "we have @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the hubble functions in three different main directions , and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) are corresponding scale factors .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be also obtained within the newtonian theory . however , in general relativity for the perfect fluid model with vanishing shear @xmath27 , and acceleration @xmath28 , the field equations can be consistent only if @xmath29 . for the dust",
    "matter fluid with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , particles of dust are moving along geodesics .",
    "this is in contrast to the newtonian case @xcite .",
    "therefore , expanding and rotating spatially homogeneous universes filled with perfect fluid must have a non - interacting shear .",
    "li @xcite considered the case that @xmath30 is sufficiently small compared with @xmath31 since the shear following equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) falls off more rapidly than the rotation , during the expansion of the universe @xcite . in the generic case in general relativity",
    "there is no solution with rotation and without shear . in other words",
    ", it has been shown that spatial homogeneous , rotating , and expanding universes with the perfect fluid have the nonvanishing shear @xcite .",
    "however , there exists such a possibility in the newtonian cosmology because some standard obstacles of newtonian cosmology can be overcome in this model @xcite .",
    "the conservation of energy gives in a relativistic case @xmath32 the occurrence of the term @xmath20 in the factor ( @xmath33 ) has a special relativistic effect .",
    "it is a consequence of the inertia assigned to all forms of energy .",
    "the newtonian counterpart of equation  ( [ eq:3 ] ) corresponds to @xmath34 ( dust for which world lines of fluid are geodesics @xcite ) .    for a rotating ,",
    "spherically symmetric , self - gravitating system with a characteristic size @xmath35 , mean density @xmath19 , and rotation @xmath31 , the angular momentum @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the angular momentum conservation can be written in the newtonian case in the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an average scale factor .",
    "principle ( [ eq:4 ] ) has its counterpart in the relativistic case @xcite @xmath40 in the general relativistic case rotation is governed by a pair of nonlinear propagation and constraint equations which for the case of the barotropic equation of state reduces to @xcite @xmath41 \\omega_a\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is a shear eigenvector ( @xmath43 ) , and @xmath44 is a velocity of sound ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the einstein equation for the considered case has a first integral in the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the ricci scalar of three space equalled to @xmath48 ( @xmath49 for b(v ) and @xmath50 for b(i ) ) and for a natural system of units @xmath51 .",
    "we usually work with the equation of state of the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a constant . from the physical point of view ,",
    "the most important values are @xmath10 ( dust ) , @xmath54 ( radiation ) , @xmath55 ( strings ) , @xmath56 ( brane effects ) , @xmath57 ( solid dark energy or topological defects ) .",
    "let us note that in equation  ( [ eq:6 ] ) there is no dependence on a particular form of the equation state .",
    "if the matter is in a pressure - free form it is represented only by its 4-velocity @xmath58 and its energy density @xmath19 . from the momentum conservation",
    "we obtain that matter moves along geodesics . for our further analysis",
    "it would be useful to rewrite equation  ( [ eq:4 ] ) to the form of a differential equation @xmath59 for the equation of state in the form ( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "after differentiation both sides of equation  ( [ eq:6 ] ) with respect to the time variable and then the substitution of equation  ( [ eq:6 ] ) we can obtain the raychaudhuri equation .",
    "it explicitly demonstrates that in terms of the average hubble function @xmath60 equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) is really a first integral of basic equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) . in the considered case",
    "we write this equation in the form @xmath61 where the bar over @xmath62 will be further omitted . for the frw symmetry we have @xmath63 , ( but in general the hubble function @xmath62 is understood to be averaged over three different main directions ) . for anisotropic models",

    "equation ( [ eq:12 ] ) has a first integral which can be expressed for @xmath75 in terms of the potential function @xmath80 as @xmath81 now we can construct the hamiltonian @xmath82 trajectories of system ( [ eq:16 ] ) are situated on the distinguished energy level , @xmath83 .",
    "we can also define a new hamiltonian flow in the one - dimensional configuration space on the zero energy level by translating the curvature contribution to the hamiltonian .",
    "then @xmath84 where for @xmath75 @xmath85 and for @xmath54 the hamiltonian takes the special form @xmath86 which becomes consistent with the form of first integral ( [ eq:6 ] ) only for @xmath87 .",

    "is given in the hamiltonian form and trajectories lie on the distinguished level of constant energy .",
    "finally , for radiation ( @xmath90 ) we obtain the new hamiltonian considered on the zero energy level @xmath91    note that this model is dynamically equivalent to standard model with some effective curvature , @xmath92 let us consider the frw ( @xmath93 ) model filled with some pure unknown matter @xmath94 such that @xmath95",

    "<S> we reduce dynamics of these models to the frw models with some fictitious fluid which scales like radiation matter . </S>",
    "<S> this fluid mimics dynamically effects of global rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of the global rotation of the universe for the resolution of the acceleration and horizon problems in cosmology is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that dynamics of the universe can be reduced to the two - dimensional hamiltonian dynamical system . </S>",
    "<S> then the construction of the hamiltonian allows for full classification of evolution paths . on the phase portraits we find the domains of cosmic acceleration for the globally rotating universe as well as the trajectories for which the horizon problem is solved . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the frw models with global rotation are structurally stable . </S>",
    "<S> this proves that the universe acceleration is due to the global rotation . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown how global rotation gives a natural explanation of the empirical relation between angular momentum for clusters and superclusters of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the relation @xmath0 is obtained as a consequence of self similarity invariance of the dynamics of the frw model with global rotation . in derivation of this relation </S>",
    "<S> we use the lie group of symmetry analysis of differential equation . </S>"
