    "the drell - yan pair production remains up to now the theoretically cleanest way to access sea - quark distributions in hadrons .",
    "necessary stage of such analysis is the measurement both with protons and neutrons , in which sea - quarks with different flavors are probed .",
    "as the construction of a target containing free neutrons is not feasible , nuclear targets have to be employed . in the experiment that used the simplest nuclear target",
    " the deuteron , the flavor asymmetry of the sea - quark distributions in the nucleon has been observed  @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", analysis of the deep inelastic scattering off different nuclei shows that nucleon valence quark structure changes beyond mass - shell  @xcite .",
    "recent studies within the bethe - salpeter formalism point to the relativistic nature of this phenomenon .",
    "relativistic effects should be manifested as modification of the sea quark distribution in the bound nucleon and , therefore , will change the contribution of the sea quark component in the nucleon structure extracted from the deuteron data .",
    "this , in turn , affects estimations of the anti - quark component made by analyzing the deuteron and proton data .    to clarify the role of the relativistic effects in the drell - yan ( dy ) pair production",
    ", we study this process within the bethe - salpeter approach .",
    "since the amplitude for the drell - yan scattering is defined by the imaginary part of the amplitude for the forward scattering @xmath2 in the cross - channel , we can obtain it within the bethe - salpeter formalism developed for dis  @xcite . within this approach",
    "the matrix element is defined by the nucleon space - time distribution and vacuum average of the t - product of the nucleon fields and nucleon electromagnetic current  ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . following this method",
    "we get the following expression of the cross - section for the drell - yan scattering off deuteron : @xmath3 this expression gives the cross - section of the dy pair production off the deuteron in terms of the off - mass - shell dy nucleon cross - section @xmath4 and the nucleon distribution function @xmath5 .",
    "this distribution function is defined by the bethe - salpeter amplitudes , and together with the denominator it composes the four - dimensional momentum distribution of the struck nucleon inside the deuteron carrying the total momentum @xmath6 . in that way eq .",
    "( [ fermi4d ] ) expresses the nucleon blurring that results from the four - dimensional distribution of the nucleon inside the nucleus . by analogy with the non - relativistic @xmath7d momentum distribution",
    "we call it four - dimensional fermi motion .    due to the four - dimensional integration in eq .",
    "( [ fermi4d ] ) actual calculations require information about nucleon cross - section @xmath4 in the kinematical region of the off - mass - shell values of the nucleon energy @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . the off - mass - shell behavior of @xmath4 is unobservable , since then explicit microscopic calculations of the cross - section have no experimental reference and strongly model dependent .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ fermi4d ] ) has to be rewritten in terms of measurable quantities such as the cross - section for dy scattering off the physical nucleon .",
    "the simplest solution of this problem is provided by the integration in eq .",
    "( [ fermi4d ] ) with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "analytical properties of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ fermi4d ] ) give a way to do it explicitly . within the assumption that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are regular with respect to @xmath8 the integrand contains a second order pole corresponding to the struck nucleon and a first order pole corresponding to the spectator .",
    "these poles lie in the different half - planes of the complex plane @xmath8 .",
    "so , we can choose one of the singularities to perform the integration . to express the nuclear hadron tensor in terms of the nucleon structure functions",
    "it is necessary to choose the second order pole ( @xmath12 ) that corresponds to the struck nucleon .",
    "the result of the contour integration in vicinity of the second order pole in eq.([fermi4d ] ) is defined by the derivative of the pole residue with respect to @xmath8 at the point @xmath13 .",
    "doing the integration and using the relation in the bjorken limit @xmath14 we get the following expression for the cross section of the dy pair production off the deuteron :    @xmath15 \\frac{f^{n / d}(m_d,{\\bf p})}{8m_{d}e_{\\rm n}^2{\\delta^{\\rm n}_{\\rm d}}^2},\\label{s2a}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is the bjorken @xmath0 of the struck nucleon , @xmath17 is the nucleon on - shell energy , @xmath18 is equivalent to the total energy shift of the struck nucleon due to the binding and fermi motion .",
    "the function @xmath19 together with the denominator composes the three dimensional momentum distribution of the struck nucleon inside the deuteron . according to the normalization condition for the bethe - salpeter vertex function this distribution satisfies the baryon and momentum sum rules  @xcite and coincides with the usual nuclear momentum distribution .",
    "thus , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ s2a ] ) , which results from the derivative of the propagator of the nuclear spectator , expresses contribution of the conventional @xmath7d - fermi motion .    the second term with @xmath20 results from the nucleon dis amplitude derivative : @xmath21 this term is responsible for the deviation from unity of the ratio of the cross sections .",
    "its contribution is proportional to the coefficient @xmath22 ; which , therefore , characterizes contribution of the four - dimensional fermi - motion .",
    "it is important to note that the struck nucleon pole gives the factor @xmath23 , since then the contribution from all other singularities ( for example nucleon self - energy cut or anti - nucleon pole ) are suppressed at least as @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "since the mean value of the energy shift is small ( @xmath25 ) , eq.([s2a ] ) provide deuteron drell - yan cross - section with accuracy up to terms of order @xmath26 .",
    "using the gluck - reya - voght ( grv ) parameterization  @xcite for the @xmath4 and solution of the bethe - salpeter equation with the graz - ii separable kernel  @xcite as @xmath19 we make numerical calculation fo the ratio @xmath27 .",
    "it is important to note that the full grv parameterization is obtained within the approximation @xmath28 , therefore it already implies isospin asymmetry of the sea - quark distribution in the nucleon in order to describe the dy data . to check influence of the relativistic nuclear effects on the deviations of the ratio @xmath27 from unity we use the grv parameterization without quark - sea asymmetry ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the results of the calculation are presented in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the dashed curve represents the calculation within the approximation with @xmath28 , the solid curve represent calculation with the four - dimensional fermi - motion taken into account .",
    "it is clear from the comparison with the new fnal data  @xcite , that the relativistic kinematics can reproduce the deviation of the cross - section ration without the flavor asymmetry of the nucleon sea .",
    "it is important to note , that the @xmath30-dependence of the deviation is defined by the coefficient @xmath31 in front of the cross - section derivative same as in case of dis .",
    "thus , we can conclude that observed flavor asymmetry results from the relativistic kinematics of bound nucleons ; the bound nucleon structure change have the same nature in the dis and dy processes ; the effect has the same @xmath30-dependence as emc - effect .",
    "a more detailed study of the @xmath30-dependence of the effect and high-@xmath0 data can shed more light on the nature of the sea - quark flavour asymmetry in the nucleon .",
    "i would like to thank g.  smirnov , u.  mosel , h.  toki and o.lynnik for useful discussions .",
    "i also thank research center for nuclear physics of the osaka university for the support and warm hospitality . the work is made under partial support of the fenu innovation educational programme in the framework of the national project `` education '' ."
