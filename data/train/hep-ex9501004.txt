    "a xenon flash lamp having a 3 mm gap was chosen , because the emission spectrum resembles erenkov light .",

    "the gain of each counter was calibrated with 4 , 2 , and 1 gev electron beams from the it1 beam line @xcite at the 8-gev accumulator ring ( ar ) at kek .",
    "we have accumulated bhabha scattering events , after standard cuts of requiring two clusters of deposited energy greater than 1/3 of the beam energy at @xmath19 satisfying an acolinearity angle being less than 10@xmath20 .",
    "the obtained resolution was 4.5% , apparently dominated by the nonuniformity in the gains of individual counters .",

    "the electron energy - loss in the material in front of the bcl was investigated by studying the e / p for electrons . in this study",
    "we used an experimental two - track sample selected by the following criteria , expecting these to be dominantly @xmath21 events :    1 .   the number of charged tracks with @xmath22 gev , the polar angle @xmath23 , and the number of degrees of freedom ( n.d.f . ) of charged - track fitting @xmath24 3 had to be 2 ; 2 .",
    "the number of the bcl clusters with @xmath25 mev had to be at least 1 ; and 3 .",
    "the visible energy ( @xmath26 ) of the event had to satisfy @xmath27 gev , where both the charged tracks in the tpc and the clusters in the bcl were used .",
    "most of the selected events were expected to be two - photon events of ( @xmath28)@xmath28 , ( @xmath28)@xmath29 , and ( @xmath28)@xmath30 . the remaining ones were @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , etc .",

    "these selection cuts left 9120 two - track events .    to separate electron tracks from muons and pions ,",
    "we used energy - loss ( @xmath7 ) information from the tpc and tof as follows : ( 1 ) the electron - candidate tracks were required to have @xmath7 in the range of 5.5 @xmath34 de / dx @xmath34 7.5 kev / cm ; ( 2 ) the confidence level ( cl ) for the electron hypothesis by the tof information had to be @xmath35 0.01 .",

    "the tpc - bcl combination was chosen when the distance between the bcl cluster and the extrapolated track was shortest .",
    "we only calculated the e / p for the tpc - bcl combination whose distance was less than 10 cm .    to determine the bcl energy correction we fitted the e / p distribution with a second - order polynomial of the bcl energy .",

    "for single - photon - exchange process , we used jetset6.3 as an event generator @xcite .",
    "the parameters used in this program were fitted for general event shapes @xcite . for two - photon processes ,",
    "we used own event generator of which the details were described in reference @xcite .      the particles generated by the above - mentioned event - generation program were traced through the topaz detector simulator .",
    "this detector simulation was designed to take into account all conceivable interactions which the particles might experience in the detector , and to mimic the detector response to them as closely as possible . the structures and materials of the detectors",
    "are precisely coded in the program and each particle is propagated by a small step from the interaction point . at each step ,",
    "such interactions as decays , multiple scatterings , and bremsstrahlungs take place according to the probabilities associated with them .    in the tpc region the averaged energy loss in the gas is calculated according to a formula determined from the minimum ionizing pions in real data , knowing the velocity and charge of the particle .",
    "the landau fluctuation is taken into account by smearing the energy loss so as to be consistent with the experimental distribution .",
    "the smeared energy loss is translated to a pulse height on the corresponding wire to be sampled in order to mimic the digitized outputs .",
    "because the time profile of the wire signal was experimentally found to be independent of the track angle , a single pulse - height shape function is used to calculate the pulse height in each time bucket .",
    "the pulse height is digitized if it is above the threshold , and is recorded as wire data .",
    "pad signals are generated using the pulse heights of the relevant five wires near to the pad rows .",
    "the avalanches on the five wires induced a charge along the pad row .",
    "we assume that the induced charge is a gaussian distribution , and is proportional to the corresponding wire pulse heights .",
    "the width of the gaussian and the weight factors for the five wires are determined experimentally @xcite .    to simulate the electromagnetic shower development in the material ,",
    "the egs code is widely used @xcite .",
    "the cut - off energy in the egs program , when it is used , must be set at a value sufficiently lower than a critical energy for an accurate simulation , which consequently needs more cpu time . in the bcl ,",
    "the electromagnetic shower is simulated by using the bootstrap method to save cpu time @xcite .",
    "this method utilizes pre - generated showers to obtain the shower density in cells of suitable size in the calorimeter .",
    "the development of a shower with an energy lower than the cut - off is replaced by them .",
    "thus , once many sets of the frozen showers are prepared for various energies , the shower simulation can be carried out as accurately as that of the egs code , while at the same time considerably reducing the cpu time .    for a nuclear interaction geisha 7",
    "is used @xcite .",
    "short - lived particles such as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are decayed in the simulator program while keeping secondary vertex information .",
    "the charged trigger required at least two charged tracks with @xmath43 0.3 - 0.7 gev and an opening angle @xmath35 45 - 70@xmath20 , depending on the beam conditions .",

    "the energy - loss measurement with the time - projection chamber and the energy measurement with the lead - glass calorimeter provided good electron identification over a wide momentum range . in particular , low-@xmath0 ( @xmath80 gev ) electron identification was proven to be possible .",
    "this is powerful for studying the open - charm production in two - photon processes .",
    "the pion - rejection factors and the electron efficiencies inside hadronic jets were obtained to be 163 and 68.4% for high-@xmath0 electrons and 137 and 42.7% for low-@xmath0 electrons in single - photon - exchange process , and 8600 and 36.0% for two - photon processes .",
