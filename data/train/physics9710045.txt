    "the stark broadening of spectral lines is due to interactions of the emitting atom ( ion ) with electrons and ions in a plasma @xcite .",
    "the resulting line profiles can serve as an important tool for plasma diagnostics in a very broad range of plasma parameters .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that stark broadening diagnostics generally require quite elaborate calculations .",
    "therefore , comparison of theoretical line profiles with the stark widths measured for well determined plasma conditions is very important for the improvement of theoretical approximations and techniques .",
    "recently , accurate line profile measurements of the @xmath4 fine - structure components of the resonance doublet in li - like boron were performed by glenzer and kunze @xcite .",
    "they used a homogeneous plasma region in a gas - liner pinch discharge ; and plasma parameters , such as local electron density and ion temperature , were independently determined by 90@xmath5 collective thomson scattering .",
    "the stark line widths were measured to be @xmath6   for an electron density @xmath7 @xmath8 and temperatures @xmath9 ev .",
    "this value of @xmath10 is within 25% of the results of semi - empirical @xcite and semi - classical @xcite calculations and exceeds the quantum - mechanical r - matrix calculations @xcite almost by a factor of 2 .",
    "a similar discrepancy between measurements and quantum - mechanical calculations had been noticed previously for @xmath4 resonance transitions in another li - like ion , namely , be ii @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the stark line width of the @xmath4  transitions in b iii . in sec .",
    "ii the theoretical approach and atomic data used in our calculations are presented .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iii , we present the results and discuss the reasons for differences between quantum - mechanical and other calculations as well as experiment . finally , sec .",
    "iv contains conclusions and suggestions .",
    "as was shown by baranger @xcite , for an isolated line corresponding to a transition @xmath11 the full collisional width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) is given by :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the electron density , @xmath14 is the velocity of the scattering electron , and @xmath15 is the maxwellian electron velocity distribution .",
    "the electron impact cross sections @xmath16 represent contributions from transitions connecting the upper ( lower ) level with other perturbing levels ( indicated by primes ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , the @xmath17 and @xmath18 are elastic scattering amplitudes for the target ion in the upper and lower states , respectively , and the integral is performed over the scattering angle @xmath19 , with @xmath20 being the element of solid angle .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) relates a line width in the impact approximation with atomic cross sections , facilitating the use of well - developed techniques of atomic scattering calculations for line broadening studies .",
    "the inelastic terms account for broadening due to life - time shortening , i.e. , broadening associated with decaying amplitudes of the emitted waves .",
    "the elastic terms are due to phase shifts between wave trains before and after collisions ; these phase shifts arise from the differences in perturbations of upper and lower levels .",
    "the electron impact broadening of the @xmath4 principal resonance lines in li - like ions differs from the broadening of other lines ( like , e.g. , @xmath21 ) due to the specific level structure of li - like ions .",
    "both initial and final levels of this transition are well separated from the other excited levels , the energy difference between @xmath22 and @xmath23 states being much smaller than the energy gap to the nearest @xmath24 level [ in b iii @xmath25 ev , while @xmath26 ev ] .",
    "hence , the @xmath27 inelastic collisions are only marginally important for the broadening of this line .",
    "additionally , the temperature of maximal abundance of b iii in plasmas is a few times smaller than its ionization potential @xmath28 ev unless the plasma is rapidly ionizing .",
    "therefore , it is hardly possible to have b iii resonance lines in high - temperature , high - density plasmas where inelastic perturbations due to interactions with @xmath29 levels would become important .    quite surprisingly , practically no accurate atomic data were available for b iii until very recently .",
    "the evaluated bibliographic compilation of electron impact excitation cross sections for ions @xcite contains only _ one _ paper on b iii with poor accuracy .",
    "this differs drastically from the other members of the li - like sequence ( be ii , c iv , etc . ) , where on the average more than 15 papers were published for each ion , some calculations being claimed to be accurate to within @xmath30 .",
    "fortunately , very accurate results for excitation cross sections from the ground state of b iii have recently been achieved @xcite .",
    "they were obtained with two new methods in atomic collision theory , viz .",
    ", convergent close - coupling ( ccc ) @xcite and r - matrix with pseudostates ( rmps ) @xcite , which proved to be very successful in calculations of electron scattering on quasi - one - electron ions ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although the ccc and rmps methods are quite close in principle , the agreement of _ independently _ obtained results which are separately checked for convergence in coordinate and momentum subspaces is a very convincing argument for these data to be accurate .",
    "the ccc method is a standard close - coupling approach where all target states ( discrete and continuum ) are obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in a large orthogonal laguerre basis , and the coupled equations are formulated in momentum space .",
    "therefore , the convergence can be easily tested by simply increasing the basis size .",
    "the use of momentum space allows one to avoid the common difficulties related to the oscillating behavior of wavefunctions in coordinate space .",
    "the rmps method @xcite is a modification of the standard low - energy r - matrix approach @xcite , where a much larger number of pseudo - orbitals is taken into account .",
    "this significantly improves the description of both the physical target states and highly excited and continuum pseudostates . for details on these methods",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .    for",
    "calculations of @xmath31 and @xmath32 cross sections , which are relatively small , we used the coulomb - born - exchange ( cbe ) code _ atom _ ( the details of the basic approximations can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that in addition to accounting for coulomb attraction and exchange effects , _ atom _ calculates inelastic cross sections with _",
    "experimental _ energy differences between the states involved and allows for normalization ( unitarity ) effects . unlike more sophisticated and time - consuming ccc and rmps codes running at least on workstations , _ atom _ quickly generates many cross sections on a modest pc , which makes it especially suitable for large - scale collisional calculations .",
    "although the application of the cbe method to a relatively low charge ion such as b iii may be questioned , the difference between the _ atom _ and ccc / rmps cross sections is mostly only about 30% at threshold .",
    "( for highly charged li - like ions the cbe and ccc results agree much better with each other @xcite . )",
    "the non - coulomb elastic scattering amplitudes @xmath33 and @xmath34 were calculated with the ccc method .",
    "the corresponding elastic cross sections @xmath35 and @xmath36 as well as the elastic difference term @xmath37 are presented in fig . 1 as a function of the electron energy in the range @xmath38 ev .",
    "one can see a noticeable difference in the energy dependence of these parameters . while @xmath35 and @xmath39 approximately behave as @xmath40 , the elastic term @xmath41 decreases much faster , so that for _ this _ energy region it can be well fitted by the function @xmath42 with @xmath43 [ for the smallest energies @xmath44 @xmath45 since , as is seen from fig . 1",
    ", @xmath46 @xmath47 at @xmath48 .",
    "the contribution of the elastic term to the line width at @xmath49 @xmath8 and @xmath50 ev is @xmath51  , whereas simply using the sum of the elastic cross sections would give @xmath52  . due to this cancellation",
    ", there may therefore be more uncertainty in @xmath53 than in the following calculation of inelastic contributions .",
    "the @xmath4 excitation cross section calculated by various methods is shown in fig .",
    "2 as a function of the incoming electron energy .",
    "one can see that contributions of resonances to this cross section are very moderate .",
    "it should be noted also that even at threshold the electron exchange contributes not more than 10% of the total cross section . for small energies",
    "the cbe cross sections lie systematically above the rmps result , but the difference is only 20% near the energy of interest .",
    "as the semi - empirical van regemorter formula for excitation cross sections ( see , e.g. , @xcite )    @xmath54    is often used in line broadening calculations , we also show two cross sections obtained with different choices of the effective gaunt factor @xmath55 . in eq .",
    "( [ gaunt_cs ] ) , @xmath56 cm is the bohr radius , @xmath57 is the absorption oscillator strength , @xmath58 is the energy difference , and @xmath59 ev . for an absorption oscillator strength of @xmath60 and the @xmath61 gaunt factor @xcite    @xmath62    with @xmath63 being the spectroscopic charge and @xmath64 the principal quantum number of the lower level , the corresponding cross section is quite accurate for not too high energies ( dot - dashed line on fig .",
    "2 ) , while the gaunt factor    @xmath65    recommended in ref .",
    "@xcite ( dashed line on fig .",
    "2 ) leads at low energies to an overestimation of the cross section by a factor of 2 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that one should be very cautious when choosing a specific form of the gaunt factor .",
    "( measurements of near threshold cross sections and excitation rate coefficients for c  iv @xcite also favor eq . ( 3 ) for @xmath66 , while earlier plasma measurements @xcite for n v , o vi and ne viii at temperatures well above @xmath58 give effective gaunt factors that are mostly smaller than those according to eqs .",
    "( [ younger ] ) and ( [ samps ] ) by factors 1.5 to 2 . )    in fig .",
    "3 we present the ratio of the sum of partial cross sections with angular momentum @xmath67 to the total @xmath4 excitation cross section at @xmath68 ev calculated with the ccc and cbe methods ( here @xmath69 is the total angular momentum of the system ion+electron ) . remarkably , both approximations show very similar behavior for this ratio with slight deviations for very low @xmath69 .",
    "it is obvious that the major contribution comes from rather small @xmath3 partial waves , so that the partial cross sections with total angular momentum up to @xmath70 give more than 60% of the total cross section .",
    "even smaller @xmath3 values dominate the elastic scattering contribution for which monopole ( @xmath71 ) contributions are very important .    to summarize , for an electron density @xmath7 @xmath8 and an electron temperature @xmath50 ev the contribution of the @xmath4 inelastic transitions , i.e. of excitation and de - excitation , to the line width is @xmath72  .",
    "the cbe method gives @xmath73  ,  which is only about 20% higher .",
    "the inelastic cross sections for the transitions @xmath31 and @xmath74 were calculated with the cbe code _ atom _ with no resonances included .",
    "although resonances in the excitation cross sections are more important for @xmath75 transitions than for @xmath4 @xcite , the contribution of the @xmath76 and @xmath77 inelastic channels to the total line width is , in fact , rather small . besides , the comparison of the rmps and cbe @xmath78 excitation cross sections shows that the inelastic rate coefficients @xmath79 produced with _ atom _ differ by about 20% on the average .",
    "this accuracy seems to be quite acceptable since the contribution of @xmath31 inelastic transitions to the stark line width is only @xmath80  . finally , the contribution of the @xmath74 transitions is one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "generally , in addition to the electron impact excitation and de - excitation , other processes of plasma particle scattering from the upper and lower levels should be taken into account as well .",
    "our cbe estimates and the ccc / rmps data @xcite show that for the @xmath4 line electron impact ionization and recombination can be safely neglected for the plasma parameters of ref .",
    "recent semi - classical results @xcite indicate that ion - ion collisions may contribute up to 10 % to the total stark width , but most calculations cited below do not take this effect into account .",
    "the sum of all electron collisional contributions to the fwhm calculated here is :    @xmath81    for an electron temperature of @xmath50 ev and an electron density of @xmath49 @xmath8 . in table",
    "i we compare the experimental line width @xmath82 @xcite with different theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "the two last columns in this table present the results of our calculations , viz .",
    ", the next to the last column corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ fwhm ] ) , while the line width in the last column was obtained with cbe for all inelastic cross sections and the elastic term from ccc .",
    "the available b iii @xmath4 stark widths are also shown in fig .",
    "4 as a function of electron temperature .",
    "our calculations presented here agree with the r - matrix results of seaton @xcite practically for all temperatures , thereby confirming the discrepancy with experiment .",
    "the 20% difference in ccc and r - matrix line widths for very small @xmath83 , where elastic collisions dominate , seems to be related to the strong cancellation effects in the scattering amplitude difference ( see sec.ii ) . on the other hand , the latest semi - classical calculations @xcite do agree with the previous results obtained with similar methods @xcite as well as with the measured value of the line width ,",
    "although for small @xmath83 the results of dimitrijevi and sahal - brechot @xcite deviate significantly from the other calculations .",
    "we also show modified semi - empirical results @xcite which , although calculated only up to @xmath84 ev , are very close to both sets of quantum - mechanical calculations .",
    "having confirmed the results of the quantum calculations of seaton @xcite , a first question is why impact - parameter , semi - classical @xcite and closely related semi - empirical @xcite methods lead to substantially larger widths ( closer to the experiment ) .",
    "the answer is related to the dominant role of collisions corresponding to total angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath85 ( see sec .",
    "ii ) of the ( colliding ) electron - ion system .",
    "this fact is equivalent to saying that the spread of wave packets constructed in order to represent the colliding electrons classically is comparable to or larger than relevant impact parameters .",
    "( the ratio of de - broglie wavelength @xmath86 and impact parameter @xmath87 is @xmath88 . )",
    "the wave packet spread leads to a reduction of the electron - ion interaction and thus to a decrease in the ensuing line width .",
    "this occurs because the electric fields causing stark broadening are generated by local deviations from plasma charge neutrality , and because these deviations are reduced over spatial scales of the order of the de - broglie wavelength .",
    "note also that even most recent semi - classical calculations @xcite explicitly account only for long - range , dipole ( @xmath89 @xmath90 ) and quadrupole ( @xmath91 @xmath92 ) perturbations , although for collisions within the perturbed - electron radius there is also the short - range monopole @xmath71 term which , for example , has asymptotic matrix elements @xmath93 for @xmath94 transitions @xcite .",
    "this term is properly allowed for in the quantum calculations and further smoothes the electron - ion interactions .    to illustrate the relation between relevant electron - ion separations at the perihelion @xmath95 of the classical ( unperturbed ) orbits and angular momentum @xmath3 corresponding to the impact parameter @xmath87 , consider    @xmath96 ^{\\frac{1}{2}}+1 } ,   \\label{periratio}\\ ] ]    which follows from eqs .",
    "( 116 ) , ( 117 ) and ( 118 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite with the coulomb parameter    @xmath97    for doubly - charged ions and electrons of velocity @xmath14 .",
    "our calculations with the hartree - fock code of cowan @xcite show that for b iii ions in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 states , the corresponding bound state mean radii are close to @xmath98 , while typical coulomb parameters range from about 2 to 4 ( for @xmath99 ev , @xmath100 ) . as can be seen from table ii",
    ", the classical orbits indeed penetrate deeply , or , at least , come to within factor 2 of the bound state orbits for angular momenta found to be most important in the quantum scattering calculations ( see fig .",
    "the theoretical conclusion that semi - classical calculations overestimate the electron collisional broadening of the b iii @xmath4 lines by a factor of about 2 leaves one with the dilemma of having about the same disagreement with the experiment @xcite , for which the combined error in stark width and electron density measurements was estimated to about 20% . a natural suggestion is to reconsider any possible systematic errors , a probable cause for such errors being hydrodynamic turbulence associated with plasma flows in the gas - liner , z - pinch experiment @xcite , similar to the mhd turbulence invoked @xcite for interpretations of high - power z - pinch experiments",
    "this would be analogous to a more extreme situation encountered in the measurement of c v @xmath101lines @xcite which had also been found to be substantially broader than predicted theoretically .",
    "however , in this theoretically rather similar case of @xmath61 transitions of he - like ions , there are both singlet and triplet lines , at rather different wavelengths of @xmath86= 3526    or 2271 and 2277 ,  respectively .",
    "the measured widths were proportional to @xmath86 rather than @xmath102 , indicating doppler rather than stark broadening to dominate . since these widths were larger than expected from thermal doppler broadening and from doppler shifts associated with radial flows , hydrodynamic turbulence in the laser - produced plasma used",
    "was inferred from this excess broadening , with an effective temperature of 600 ev .",
    "although radial laser - blowoff and pinch implosion velocities are very similar in these experiments , both approaching 10@xmath103 cm / sec , there is , of course , an essential difference in that the b iii measurements were made in a 50 nsec interval shortly after maximum compression , while the c v measurements were taken while axial velocities were still about @xmath104 cm / sec . however , this distinction may not be very important , because any turbulence from high reynolds number flows decays only on a time scale @xmath105 of @xmath106 @xcite , if @xmath107 is a characteristic length and @xmath108 a typical spatial difference of flow velocities .",
    "with @xmath109 cm and @xmath110 cm / sec one would thus expect @xmath111 @xmath112 , much too long for any turbulence to decay before the b iii measurement interval .    as to typical reynolds numbers    @xmath113    _ during _ the pinch implosion",
    ", we estimate @xmath114 for @xmath115 cm / sec , @xmath116 cm , and a kinematic viscosity @xcite ,    @xmath117    of 990 @xmath118/sec , at t = 10 ev , n@xmath119 @xmath8 and a coulomb logarithm @xcite of 6.1 .",
    "since the implosion takes more than 1 @xmath120sec , developed and saturated turbulence seems therefore unavoidable , @xmath121 being larger than critical reynolds numbers @xcite .",
    "note also that any magnetic field effects are not likely to reduce the turbulence significantly , both because fields and plasma are probably fairly well separated @xcite and because the corresponding parameter @xmath122 is well below 1 in any case ( here @xmath123 is the ion gyrofrequency and @xmath124 is the ion - ion collision time ) .",
    "another question is the extent to which the turbulence is transported radially inward or mixed into the test gas region .",
    "however , even local reynolds numbers are probably above critical over most of this region and significant reynolds stresses would be needed to compensate for the reduction in particle pressure implied below .",
    "the reader may wonder whether the ( collective ) thomson scattering diagnostics @xcite used in the b iii experiment @xcite would not have indicated the existence of hydrodynamic turbulence . for sufficiently high concentrations of heavier elements in the hydrogen",
    "fill gas , the so - called impurity peak would then indeed indicate a higher temperature for these ions than for protons ( see , e.g .. , fig .",
    "@xcite ) , although the larger width of this peak near peak compression could just as well be caused by turbulent velocities close to the thermal velocities of the protons provided the turbulent eddies are smaller than the scattering volume .",
    "for relatively high impurity concentrations , radiative energy losses are very important @xcite , facilitating a more rapid decay of the turbulence than estimated above .",
    "this is consistent with the narrower impurity peaks at later times ( see fig .",
    "@xcite ) , whose widths are consistent with thermal doppler broadening at equal temperatures for the various ions .",
    "the b iii experiment , on the other hand , was done with very small concentrations of bf@xmath125 to avoid self - absorption of the @xmath4 lines .",
    "the impurity feature on the scattering spectrum could therefore not be observed @xcite , and at the same time the dissipation of the turbulent energy would have taken much longer , say , the 1 @xmath120sec plasma life time quoted in ref .",
    "one is therefore left with the possibility of an alternative interpretation of the scattering spectra , e.g. , of that shown in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "namely , instead of inferring a temperature of 10 ev , essentially from the width of the proton feature , assume turbulent rms velocities equal to proton thermal velocities .",
    "this also means lower temperatures for the protons , say , 5 ev . as emphasized by glenzer and kunze @xcite ,",
    "electron - ion relaxation times are extremely short , so that we also infer @xmath83 @xmath126 5 ev .",
    "this is a much more favorable electron temperature for the observation of the b iii @xmath127 lines than 10 ev in this nearly steady state plasma , because at 5 ev about 20% of the boron ions are b iii , contrasted to less than 1% at 10 ev .",
    "independent evidence for @xmath128 ev could be provided by the absence of the @xmath129 line at @xmath130  , reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , whose intensity was evidently @xmath131 of the 2066   line . at 10 ev",
    ", the relative intensity of the 2077   line would be about 1 .",
    "( note that standard lte relations can be used for this estimate , to within about 10% for the temperature .",
    "since the @xmath129 line may be about 3  wide , corresponding line ratio measurements would best be done at reduced spectral resolution . )",
    "any deviations between shapes of thermal and thermal plus turbulence scattering spectra would probably be too small to be observable , leaving its width as the major invariant .",
    "some deviations could , of course , be indications of non - gaussian distributions of the turbulent velocity components .    besides suggesting investigations of turbulence in the gas - liner pinch , perhaps along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite and by use of line pairs with different sensitivities to stark and doppler broadening @xcite , it remains to be shown that the level of turbulence assumed here would suffice to obtain agreement of measured line widths with quantum - mechanical calculations .",
    "note first that there will be no significant change in the electron density , @xmath7 @xmath8 , because of the large value of the scattering parameter @xmath132 , i.e. , of @xmath133 , @xmath134 here being the wavenumber of the electron density fluctuation responsible for the scattering and @xmath135 the debye length @xcite .",
    "however , the predicted electron - collisional width of , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , is now 0.14   because of the reduced electron temperature , whereas the predicted total doppler width is increased by a factor @xmath136 to 0.125  , @xmath137 standing for turbulent plus thermal doppler broadening at a boron / proton mass ratio of 10.8 , 1/2 for the reduction in temperature . with 0.07 and 0.05   lorentzian and gaussian instrumental broadening @xcite and 0.02   proton impact broadening @xcite , this gives a total line width @xcite of 0.28  , i.e. , more than 90% of the measured total width @xcite .",
    "there would therefore be agreement well within combined experimental and theoretical errors relative to the previous quantum - mechanical calculations and , more marginally , also with the present calculations , which result in 0.27  , if one allows again for a 0.02   contribution from ion - ion collisions , were the degree of turbulence indeed as high as assumed here .",
    "verification of this assumption would remove a major obstacle in our quantitative understanding of stark broadening of isolated lines from multiply ionized atoms , including possibly the anomalous scaling of line widths along isoelectronic sequences @xcite . in the last experiment , on @xmath138 line widths of",
    "be - like neon , improved semi - classical calculations @xcite were found to be consistent with the measured widths , but judging from the present b iii @xmath4 comparisons and given similar ratios of impact parameters and bound state radii , this agreement may again be spurious .",
    "a fully quantum - mechanical calculation of the stark line width for the @xmath139 line of b iii was carried out with the use of the latest atomic data reflecting the present state - of - the - art in atomic collision theory .",
    "although the obtained results agree well with the previous quantum r - matrix stark widths , the difference with semi - classical and some semi - empirical calculations as well as with the measured values is of order of 2 .",
    "this seems to originate in ( i ) failure of the non - quantum calculations for small impact parameters which are most important for the line width in question , and from ( ii ) not accounting for the turbulent plasma motion which significantly affects the determination of doppler broadening and plasma temperature .",
    "independent ion line width measurements for plasmas with well - known parameters , and not subject to significant contributions from other line broadening mechanisms than stark broadening , continue to be very important .",
