    "one century after einstein s explanation of brownian motion @xcite , compare also @xcite , stochastic processes are ubiquitous in almost every branch of physics @xcite and beyond it like in economics @xcite , chemistry @xcite and biology @xcite .",
    "the notion `` brownian motion '' not only stands for the movement of pollens suspended in water , but is a generic term for the wiener process @xcite , see also the textbooks @xcite .",
    "two main approaches in describing stochastic processes has been developed , related to the langevin and to the fokker - planck equation , respectively .",
    "the underlying basic for the stochastic description is the ability of a separation of time scales leading to an evolution equation with a deterministic part supplemented by a stochastic force . in this langevin equation",
    "the probability of the stochastic force is in general an input .",
    "an alternative way is the treatment of the stochastic process by the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) @xcite , where a parabolic partial differential equation for a probability density is the basis of calculation . as already known both description are equivalent for special stochastic forces @xcite . in the last decades",
    "there is an increasing effort in generalization of the langevin equation respectively the fokker - planck equation by including memory effects @xcite . in the framework of investigation of anomalous diffusion @xcite and fractional diffusion @xcite",
    "the descriptive equations are non - markovian ( non - local in time ) .",
    "the combination of diffusion with feedback couplings has not only an influence on the long time behavior , for the stationary state , but on the dynamics in an intermediate time regime .",
    "such a memory dominated behavior is well established in analyzing the freezing processes in undercooled liquids @xcite , where the underlying mathematical representation is based on a projector formalism proposed by mori @xcite . in @xcite two of us studied a simple model , which still includes the dynamical features of evolution models as conservation of the relevant quantity @xmath0 , which could be interpreted as probability density for a particle and moreover , a time delayed feedback coupling . due to",
    "this coupling the generic behavior may be changed by the additional delay effects and could lead to non - stationary steady state solutions .",
    "+ the aim of the present paper is to show the equivalence between a special non - markovian equation @xcite and the standard fpe with a non - trivial drift term .",
    "firstly we present the non - markovian model and its main features which consists of the occurrence of a non - trivial stationary solution and the dependence of the solution on the initial distribution @xmath1 . as the result",
    "the underlying fpe reveals a drift term which is itself determined by the strength of the stochastic force .",
    "the corresponding potential are discussed in detail .",
    "the analytical results are supported by numerical simulations .",
    "in media with a spatial  temporal accumulation process transport phenomena should be described by a stochastic approach  @xcite based on probabilities .",
    "the time evolution of the probability density could depend on the history of the sample to which it belongs , i.  e. the changing rate of the probability should be influenced by the changing rate in the past and so the evolution equation of the probability has to be supplemented by memory terms . a recent overview is given in  @xcite .",
    "the obvious modification of the fpe by memory effects is to replace the conventional equation by @xcite @xmath2 this equation is of convolution type and consists of two competing parts standing for processes on different timescales . the first part manifested by the operator @xmath3 characterizes the instantaneous and local process ,",
    "whereas the second part with the operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the delayed processes , the memory .",
    "in general all the operators may be non - linear in @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "physically it means that the time scale of the memory is determined by the relevant probability @xmath8 itself .",
    "the specification of the operators has to be according to the physical situation , which one deals with .",
    "however the main feature of the probability density @xmath6 is its conservation in time : @xmath9 to preserve @xmath8 the instantaneous term @xmath3 has to be related to a probability current , e.  g. , @xmath10 . for an arbitrary polynomial kernel @xmath11 the conservation law ( [ eq:02 ] )",
    "is not fulfilled in general .",
    "using laplace transformation one can show directly , compare for details  @xcite , that the choice @xmath12 guarantees conservation .",
    "thus our starting equation is written in the form @xmath13 as a special realization of eq .",
    "( [ eq:01 ] ) .",
    "this fokker - planck equation relates @xmath14 to @xmath15 with @xmath16 unlike to a conventional one , where the evolution is only dependent on the probability at present time .",
    "moreover offers a coupling between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the mixing of time scales leads to a substantial modification of the long time limit . to demonstrate the modification",
    "let us consider a very simple choice by a strictly spatial local , but time independent kernel @xmath19 where parameter @xmath20 characterizes the strength of the memory . by this choice",
    "the spatial and temporal variables are decoupled . inserting the kernel in one",
    "gets @xmath21",
    "\\quad\\text{with}\\quad p_0 ( \\vec{r})\\equiv p(\\vec{r } , t=0 ) \\ , .\\ ] ] the time independence of the kernel means that all times @xmath22 @xmath23 in the past have the same weight and so there is a very strong memory with a direct coupling of the instantaneous value to the initial value .",
    "the memory induced feedback to the initial value appears as a driving force . without this coupling",
    "one can interpret the equation as a description of a particle , which performs a diffusive motion , where the probability density @xmath0 decays on a time scale @xmath24 . as is a linear equation and",
    "so the solution of it could be found analytically for arbitrary initial conditions @xmath25   \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the green s function of the conventional diffusion equation @xmath27 from the general solution , some properties could be followed easily such as if the initial distribution is non - negative @xmath28 , so the @xmath6 does provided @xmath29 .",
    "the second moment @xmath30 could be calculated @xmath31 notice that for the limit of vanishing memory @xmath32 one can easily verify that the last equation shows conventional diffusive behavior .",
    "the selection of the initial distribution is the essential point in our model and so three example are given to illustrate the solution of . without lack of generality we concentrate our calculation on the one - dimensional case .",
    "it can be generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "obviously the results for a system with memory should be sensitive with respect to the initial distribution or at least from configurations in the past . therefore , we study different realizations for @xmath33 separately .",
    "the first example is the delta  starting distribution @xmath34 . substituting this in the following solution",
    "is calculated @xmath35    \\\\ & \\nonumber \\\\",
    "f_{\\pm}&=\\text{e}^{\\pm\\kappa\\ , x}\\,\\left[\\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{\\pm x}{\\sqrt{4\\ , d\\ , t } }    + \\sqrt{\\mu\\ , t}\\right)-\\text{sgn}(\\pm x)\\right ] \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the error function @xcite and @xmath37 .",
    "the first part is the solution of the homogeneous equation showing temporal decay with time constant @xmath24 . in the long time",
    "limit the system shows a non - trivial stationary solution @xmath38 such a stationary solution is due to the permanent coupling to the initial distribution and the greater @xmath20 the stronger is this effect and more pronounced are the deviations from the pure diffusive behavior ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the generalization to higher dimensions @xmath40 and arbitrary initial condition can be directly calculated .",

    "we calculate the force @xmath51 which corresponds to the potential @xmath53 for the different starting distributions @xmath54 , in such a way that both fokker - planck equations and are equivalent . to do this deterministic parts of both equations",

    "first take an arbitrary function @xmath58 with bounded support , then integrate the product of @xmath59 and the deterministic part of resp . over the complete real line , and",

    "finally we present the results for three different initial distributions , depicted in fig .",

    "the particle stays there if no noise is present .    for the gaussian distribution",
    "the drift term is highly nonlinear and the deterministic equation is not solvable exactly . in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] the direction field of the solution of the deterministic motion is illustrated for different starting values , where the numerical calculation is done with the runge - kutta @xmath71 order algorithm with a step length @xmath72 .      as seen from fig .",
