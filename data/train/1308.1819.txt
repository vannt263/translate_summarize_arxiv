    "<S> this article motivated by the recent articles and results of two authors . </S>",
    "<S> recently , j. sadeghi and h. farahani presented a work [ 1 ] , where they include viscosity and analyze general model , by this way they extended models considered by m. khurshudyan [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] . in this article , we tempt to consider varying modified chaplygin gas model in case of variable @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known , that varying @xmath0 and @xmath1 gives rise to modified field equations and modified conservation laws . </S>",
    "<S> we will consider two different toy models . </S>",
    "<S> first model is a universe with one component phenomenological gas of our consideration , while for the second model we assume existence of a composed fluid of gas and a matter with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> sign changeable interaction between fluids is accepted . </S>",
    "<S> we will analyze important cosmological parameters like eos parameter of a fluid , deceleration parameter @xmath3 of the model .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    the observations of high redshift type snia supernovae [ 4 - 6 ] reveal the speeding up expansion of our universe . </S>",
    "<S> the surveys of clusters of galaxies show that the density of matter is very much less than critical density [ 7 ] , observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy indicate that the universe is flat and the total energy density is very close to the critical @xmath4 [ 8 ] . in order to explain experimental data concerning to the nature of the accelerated expansion of the universe a huge number of hypothesis were proposed . for instance , in general relativity framework </S>",
    "<S> , the desirable result could be achieved by so - called dark energy : an exotic and mysterious component of the universe , with negative pressure ( we thought that the energy density is always positive ) and with negative eos parameter @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> dark energy occupies about 73@xmath6 of the energy of our universe , other component , dark matter , about 23@xmath7 , and usual baryonic matter occupy about 4@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest model for a dark energy is a cosmological constant @xmath8 introduced by einstein , but with cosmological constant we faced with two problems i.e. absence of a fundamental mechanism which sets the cosmological constant zero or very small value the problem known as fine - tuning problem , because in the framework of quantum field theory , the expectation value of vacuum energy is 123 order of magnitude larger than the observed value [ 9 ] . the second problem known as cosmological coincidence problem , which asks why are we living in an epoch in which the densities of dark energy and matter are comparable ? </S>",
    "<S> alternative models of dark energy suggest a dynamical form of dark energy , which at least in an effective level , can originate from a variable cosmological constant [ 10 , 11 ] , or from various fields , such as a canonical scalar field [ 12 - 17 ] ( quintessence ) , a phantom field , that is a scalar field with a negative sign of the kinetic term [ 18 - 26 ] or the combination of quintessence and phantom in a unified model named quintom [ 27 - 40 ] and could alleviate these problems . finally , an interesting attempt to probe the nature of dark energy according to some basic quantum gravitational principles are the holographic dark energy paradigm [ 41 - 52 ] and agegraphic dark energy models [ 53 - 55 ] . </S>",
    "<S> + furthermore , since no known symmetry in nature prevents or suppresses a non - minimal coupling between dark energy and dark matter , there may exist interactions between the two components . at the same time , from observation side , no piece of evidence has been so far presented against such interactions . indeed , possible interactions between the two dark components have been discussed in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that a suitable interaction can help to alleviate the coincidence problem . </S>",
    "<S> different interacting models of dark energy have been investigated . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the interacting chaplygin gas allows the universe to cross the phantom divide , which is not permissible in pure chaplygin gas models . </S>",
    "<S> this is a recent believe and deep accepted fact among researchers . </S>",
    "<S> several different approaches are taken and intensively developed during these years in order to find an appropriate physics . </S>",
    "<S> for some cases it can be thought that not only one certain type of physics is involved and stands behind this phenomena , but rather we are working with a mixture of several physics giving the recent picture of our universe . </S>",
    "<S> there is deep hope concerning to the development of basis of quantum gravity and respectively quantum cosmology . for any case we faced with very hard problem . despite to the huge number of theoretical models and observational data and possibilities , still we are working in darkness </S>",
    "<S> and we can not find that small light : the end of tunnel . </S>",
    "<S> research in theoretical cosmology considered two possible ways to explain later time accelerated expansion of the universe . remembering the field equations , it becomes clear why . </S>",
    "<S> remember that field equations make connection between geometry and matter content of universe in a simple way . therefore there is two possibilities either we should modify matter content which is coded in energy - stress tensor or we should modify geometrical part including different functions of ricci scalar etc . different type of couplings between geometry and matter could give desirable effects as well . </S>",
    "<S> + let give some critics concerning to mentioned ways thought to be true . </S>",
    "<S> mater content modification gives possibility to include two types of matter : dark energy ( de ) and dark matter ( dm ) . </S>",
    "<S> de is a fluid with negative pressure and positive energy density ( remember this is in classical regime , with no well established quantum gravity coming from investigations of black holes stephan howking accepted possibility of existence of dark energy with negative energy density and positive pressure ) giving negative eos parameter defined as @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> today , we do not feel lack of models for de , which could be seen from the number of references given above . </S>",
    "<S> however , all of them are phenomenological models and wait to be proved by observational data . </S>",
    "<S> the same can be said for dm , which thought to operate on large scales and be responsible for structure formation , evolution etc . </S>",
    "<S> there is a thought that these two components are the manifestation of the same `` matter '' . </S>",
    "<S> even if it is true , then there is not any mechanism explaining how it was or it is possible to have such type of separation . </S>",
    "<S> then , if you can accept this possibility , then natural question is what will happen in future i.e. can they recombine together or how they will start to evolve and what are consequences . as a result of imagination , we can propose several mechanism that can make connection between de and dm and one of them is possibility having speeds faster than speed of light , making connection mysterious for our brain , because simply we can not `` see '' that . </S>",
    "<S> but if they have different origin , then we really face with a wall </S>",
    "<S> . however , independent of the mentioned and other possibilities , we have big open problem , because we do not know structure of these matters . </S>",
    "<S> research concerning to the modification matter part of field equations give rise of an understanding that more complex and crazy forms for eos equation can be considered . </S>",
    "<S> + modification of geometrical part gives rise of different modified theories like @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 etc . </S>",
    "<S> models of this origin however contain some future singularities that our universe should faced , but we do not need to worry , because these are just models and fortunately with appropriate choose of a function we can escape singularities and extend life - time for our universe . </S>",
    "<S> but , there are models also , that can explain accelerated expansion without any de , for instance , cardassian universe [ 56 - 61 ] . in this model , we need modify friedmann equations and having usual matter is enough . </S>",
    "<S> + it is well known that einstein equations of general relativity do not permit any variation in the gravitational constant @xmath0 and cosmological constant @xmath1 because of the fact that the einstein tensor has zero divergence and by energy conservation law is also zero . </S>",
    "<S> so , some modifications of einstein equations are necessary . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , if we simply allow @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be a variable in einstein equations , then energy conservation law is violated . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the study of the effect of varying @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be done only through modified field equations and modified conservation laws . </S>",
    "<S> + in this paper we use results of the resent papers [ 1 - 3 ] and extend them to the case of variable @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we will consider two different toy models . </S>",
    "<S> first model is a universe with one component phenomenological gas of our consideration , while for the second model we assume existence of a composed fluid of gas and a matter . </S>",
    "<S> we use sign changeable interaction between fluids and analyze important cosmological parameters like eos parameter of a fluid and deceleration parameter @xmath3 of the model . </S>",
    "<S> this article is organized in following way . </S>",
    "<S> section introduction is devoted to introduce basic ideas and gives some general information related to the research field and our motivation . </S>",
    "<S> next section review frw universe with variable @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in section `` phenomenological fluid and model setup '' we recall the basics of origin of the fluid and general settings how problem can be solved . </S>",
    "<S> in other sections we investigate parameters of the models and then we give conclusions .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-1 ] ]    field equations that govern our model with variable @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( see for instance [ 62 ] ) are , @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are function of time . by using the following frw metric for a flat universe </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath16 field equations can be reduced to the following friedmann equations , @xmath17 and , @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 represents the scale factor . the @xmath21 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 parameters are the usual azimuthal and polar angles of spherical coordinates , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinates ( @xmath25 ) are called co - moving coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> + energy conservation @xmath26 reads as , @xmath27 combination of ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) gives the relationship between @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath30 ever since dirac s proposition of a possible time variation of @xmath0 , a volume of works has been centered around the act of calculating the amount of variation of the gravitational constant . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , observation of spinning - down rate of pulsar @xmath31 provides the result , @xmath32 depending on the observations of pulsating white dwarf star @xmath33 , benvenuto et al . [ </S>",
    "<S> 63 ] have set up the astroseismological bound as , @xmath34 for a review to `` large number hypothesis '' ( lnh ) we refer our readers to @xcite and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> + subject of our interest is to consider a modified chaplygin gas based on a universe with variable @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this model is a phenomenological and we are interested by the evolution of the universe with this setup . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath1 we will consider one of the forms intensively considered in literature and using eq.s ( 3)-(6 ) we can recover scale factor , behavior of @xmath0 and other cosmological parameters including eos parameter and deceleration parameter @xmath3 , which could describe behavior of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point for scanning the range of parameters of the model is that acceleration will be caused by a fluid with negative eos parameter i.e. at the same time we should satisfy @xmath35 and @xmath36 conditions . keeping spirit of dirac s lnh we will consider , @xmath37 other forms for @xmath14 were considered over years based on phenomenological approach , some of examples are , for instance , @xmath38 , @xmath39 or @xmath40 to mention a few . </S>",
    "<S> as we are interested by toy models we pay our attention to the problem from a numerical investigation point of view and we believe that after some effort we also can provide exact solutions for the problem , which will be done in other forthcoming articles .    [ [ section-2 ] ]    we already mentioned , that matter modification of field equations teach us that we can consider fluids with strange eos equations . one of the examples is chaplygin gas given by [ 65 ] , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> then , generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) with the following equation of state [ 66 , 67 ] , @xmath43 with @xmath44 . as we can see the gcg is corresponding to almost dust ( @xmath45 ) at high density which is not agree completely with our universe . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) with the following equation of state introduced [ 68 - 70 ] , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a positive constant . </S>",
    "<S> this model is more appropriate choice to have constant negative pressure at low energy density and high pressure at high energy density . </S>",
    "<S> the special case of @xmath48 is the best fitted value to describe evolution of the universe from radiation regime to the @xmath1cdm regime . in the ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ 2 ] one of the authors motivated by a series of works [ 71 - 73 ] proposed a model of varying generalized chaplygin gas and considered its sign - changeable interaction of the form @xmath49 with fluid . as there is an interaction between components </S>",
    "<S> there is not energy conservation for the components separately , but for the whole mixture the energy conservation is hold . </S>",
    "<S> this approach could work as long as we are working without knowing the actual nature of the dark energy and dark matter as well as about the nature of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this approach at least from mathematical point of view is correct . </S>",
    "<S> the forms of interaction term considered in literature very often are of the following forms : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a coupling constant and positive @xmath53 means that dark energy decays into dark matter , while negative @xmath53 means dark matter decays into dark energy . from thermodynamical view </S>",
    "<S> , it is argued that the second law of thermodynamics strongly favors dark energy decays into dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> however it was found that the observations may favor the decaying of dark matter into dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> other forms for interaction term considered in literature are @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> these type of interactions are either positive or negative and can not change sign . </S>",
    "<S> however , recently by using a model independent method to deal with the observational data cai and su found that the sign of interaction @xmath59 in the dark sector changed in the redshift range of @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter , a sign - changeable interaction [ 74 ] and [ 75 ] were introduced , @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath53 are dimensionless constants , the energy density @xmath63 could be @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 is the deceleration parameter given by , @xmath67 this new type of interaction , where deceleration parameter @xmath3 is a key ingredient makes this type of interactions different from the ones considered in literature and presented above , because it can change its sign when our universe changes from deceleration @xmath68 to acceleration @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath69 is introduced from the dimensional point of view . </S>",
    "<S> we would like also to stress a fact , that by this way we import a more information about the geometry of the universe into the interaction term . </S>",
