    "the quantitative study of hydrostatic phenomena did begin in antiquity with archimedes treatise _ on floating bodies - book i _",
    ", where some propositions for the problem of the force exerted by a liquid on a body fully or partially submerged in it are proved  @xcite . in modern texts ,",
    "his propositions are reduced to a single statement known as archimedes law of buoyancy , or simply archimedes principle ( ap ) , which states that `` _ _ any object immersed in a fluid will experience an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body _ _ ''  @xcite .",
    "the continuity of this work had to wait about eighteen centuries , until the arising of the scientific method , which was the guide for the experimental investigations in hydrostatics by stevinus , galileo , torricelli , and pascal , among others .",
    "the very long time interval from archimedes to these experimentalists is a clear indicative of the advance of archimedes thoughts .",
    "as pointed out by netz ( based upon a palimpsest discovered recently ) , archimedes developed rigorous mathematical proofs for most his ideas  @xcite .",
    "however , the derivation of the exact force exerted by an _ inhomogeneous _",
    "fluid on an _ arbitrarily - shaped _",
    "body immersed in it , as will be shown here , demands the knowledge of the divergence theorem , a mathematical tool that was out of reach for the ancients .",
    "therefore , the validity of the archimedes propositions for this more general case was not formally proved on his original work .    by defining the buoyant force ( bf ) as the net force exerted by a fluid on the portion of the surface of a body ( fully or partially submerged ) that touches the fluid , the validity of ap in predicting this force can be checked .",
    "in fact , the simple case of symmetric solid bodies ( e.g. , a right - circular cylinder , as found in ref .",
    "@xcite , or a rectangular block , as found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) immersed in a liquid is used in most textbooks for proofing the validity of ap . there ,",
    "symmetry arguments are taken into account to show that the horizontal forces exerted by the liquid cancel and then the net force reduces to the difference of pressure forces exerted on the top and bottom surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the bf is then shown to point upwards , with a magnitude that agrees to ap , which also explains the origin of the bf in terms of an increase of pressure with depth  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that this proof works only for _ symmetric _ bodies with horizontal , flat surfaces on the top and the bottom , immersed in an incompressible ( i.e. , homogeneous ) fluid .",
    "although an extension of this result for _ arbitrarily - shaped _ bodies immersed in a _ liquid _ can be found in some textbooks  @xcite , a _",
    "generalization for bodies immersed in a _ compressible _",
    "( i.e. , inhomogeneous ) fluid is not found in literature .",
    "this certainly induces the readers to believe that it should be very complex mathematically , which is not true , as will be shown here .",
    "the existence of exceptions to archimedes law has been observed in some simple experiments in which the force predicted by ap is qualitatively _ incorrect _ for a body immersed in a fluid and in contact to the container walls .",
    "for instance , when a symmetric solid ( e.g. , a cylinder ) is fully submerged in a liquid with a face touching the bottom of a container , a _ downward _",
    "bf is observed , as long as no liquid seeps under the block  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the experimental evidence that this force _ increases with depth _ ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) clearly contrasts to the _ constant _ force predicted by ap .",
    "these disagreements led some authors to reconsider the completeness or correctness of the ap statement , as well as the definition of bf itself  @xcite , which seems to make the things more confusing yet .    on aiming at checking mathematically the validity of ap for arbitrarily - shaped bodies immersed in inhomogeneous fluids and intending to elucidate why the bottom case represents an exception to ap , in this work i make use of surface integrals for deriving the exact force exerted by a fluid on the surface of a body immersed in it . when the body does not touch the container walls , a gradient version of the divergence theorem applies , yielding a volume integral that reduces to the weight of the displaced fluid , in agreement to ap .",
    "for the bottom case , this approach yields a force that points _ downward _ and _ increases with depth _ , in clear disagreement to ap , but in agreement to experiments .",
    "this method also reveals that this force _ depends on the area of contact @xmath0 between the body and the bottom _ , being equal to the difference between the product @xmath1 ( @xmath2 being the pressure at the bottom ) and the weight of the displace fluid , a result that is not found in literature and could be explored in undergraduate classes .",

    "in fact , for most applications involving a liquid - air pair the second term in eq .   represents only a small correction to the naive approximation in eq .   because air density is generally much smaller than typical liquid densities . for instance , at sea level , air density is only @xmath124  kg / m@xmath125 whereas fresh water density is about @xmath123  kg / m@xmath125 .",
    "the assumption of an uniform gravitational field is a very good approximation for points near the earth s surface .",
    "however , for problems involving large depths / heights of fluids ( e.g. , undersea extraction of oil , isostasy in deep crustal layers , and others ) , the decay of the gravitational field with the distance to the center of earth has to be taken into account .",
