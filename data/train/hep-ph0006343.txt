    "matter enhanced transitions ( msw ) @xcite , the neutrino conversion and survival probabilities depend on two types of neutrino - specific parameters .",
    "one of them is the mixing matrix @xmath4 defined from @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and the sum runs over the mass states , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the other is the differences of masses squared , @xmath10 , where the latter refer to the neutrino mass states @xmath11 .",
    "there is no widely accepted mass matrix , therefore the conventional way of analyzing the results from neutrino oscillation experiments is to consider the mixing matrix as independent of the mass - squared differences .",
    "but when we assume a certain mass matrix @xmath12 in the lagrangian ( in a current basis ) @xmath13 then the mixing will explicitly depend on the masses through the diagonalization of @xmath12 .",
    "the maximal mixing arising from the democratic texture @xcite is a widely discussed example of this kind ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the mass matrix proposed by lehmann , newton and wu ( lnw ) for quarks @xcite , was recently applied to neutrinos in @xcite , and gross features of the model were explored for solar and atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we shall here examine the implications of that model in more detail , focusing on solar neutrinos , and compare the vacuum - oscillation scenario with the msw scenario .",
    "also , we will for the different cases discuss the energy spectrum of the recoil electrons induced by solar neutrinos .",
    "constraints from atmospheric neutrino data will be taken into account .",
    "let us briefly review the model being considered @xcite .",
    "one assumes that there are three neutrinos with a real mass matrix of the form : @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "this symmetric mass matrix is diagonalized by the matrix @xmath4 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the mass eigenvalues .",
    "the diagonalization involves solving a cubic equation for @xmath18 .    for an arbitrary set of mass eigenvalues , ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , the model yields two possible mixing matrices ( two physical solutions of the cubic equation ) , referred to as solution  1 and solution  2 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding mixing matrices @xmath4 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ sol1 - 2 ] for @xmath22 ( the physical region of the model extends a little beyond the triangle given by @xmath23 ) .",
    "as illustrated in those figures , the mixing elements are determined by the two mass ratios @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "[ sol1 - 2 ]    ( 9.0,8.3 ) ( -4.3,0.0 )    the neutrino oscillation data give quite strong restrictions on both the mixing and the mass - squared differences , when treated as free parameters .",
    "also , a model for the neutrino masses should not violate the experimental upper bounds on the neutrino masses @xcite : @xmath26  ev , @xmath27  mev , @xmath28  mev . furthermore , it should satisfy the mass constraints from cosmology @xcite : @xmath29  ev , be capable of explaining the apparent oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos , with @xmath30 , and give a plausible explanation of the snp , with @xmath31 ( vacuum oscillation ) or @xmath32 ( msw ) .",
    "the natural scale implied by these values for the mass - squared differences is far too small to be in conflict with any of the above - mentioned mass bounds .",
    "we denote the mass states in such a way that @xmath33 .",
    "of the two independent @xmath34 , one will be reserved for an explanation of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly , and the other will be assigned to a solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "thus we are trying in _",
    "one _ model to satisfy the two most serious neutrino problems . according to our notation",
    ", the smallest mass - squared difference will be either @xmath35 or @xmath36 .    in the present model one can fit directly in terms of _ masses _ as opposed to mass - squared differences and mixing factors .",
    "when the values of the mixing elements are given by the masses , we do not expect as good a theoretical fit to the observed data as when these parameters are considered as independent .",
    "for given values of @xmath4 and @xmath34 the probability expression for flavor conversion will be the same whether the mixing matrix is dependent on the masses or not .",
    "therefore we know to some extent from the traditional analyses where in the parameter space we can expect acceptable fits for the model we are analyzing .",
    "for example , for solar neutrinos it is known that both vacuum- and matter - influenced neutrino transitions require small @xmath37 in order to give good fits . from fig .",
    "[ sol1 - 2 ] we see that this is achieved when both @xmath24 and @xmath25 are small . and",
    "from the same figure it is apparent that in this region the mixing elements @xmath38 and @xmath39 are very sensitive to small changes in the masses .",
    "this means that by small changes in the mass ratios , the mixing elements can be adjusted close to the best - fit values obtained when @xmath4 and the masses are considered as independent .",
    ".measured and predicted ( no oscillations ) @xcite event rates for solar neutrino detectors .",
    "the flux units for the three upper detectors are given in snu , 1 event per second per @xmath40 target atoms .",
    "for the scattering detectors the fluxes are rated in units of @xmath41 .",
    "the rightmost column shows the fraction between observed and predicted fluxes .

    "one often expresses the amount of mixing in terms of angles .",
    "we adopt the following , common parameterization of the mixing matrix @xcite : @xmath42,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , etc .",
    "this will be particularly useful when we discuss the msw mechanism . if @xmath45 we get the two - generation case .    for vacuum oscillations as well as for the msw scenario",
    ", we shall discuss four cases , small @xmath35 , small @xmath36 , together with solutions  1 and 2 .",
    "we shall not here perform a detailed @xmath46 fit to the atmospheric - neutrino data . instead , we will use best - fit values for @xmath4 and @xmath34 from the literature as constraints and compare those with the acceptable regions we find for the solar neutrino data .",
    "the experimental data indicate that the `` missing '' muon neutrinos can be explained by a close to maximal @xmath47 oscillation @xcite , which requires small @xmath37 .",
    "also , the result from the chooz experiment @xcite , interpreted in terms of three generations and our choice for the @xmath34-values , indicates small @xmath37 . for masses where our model gives good fits to the solar neutrino data",
    ", we actually have @xmath48 .",
    "this criterion allows us to neglect matter effects for atmospheric neutrinos @xcite .    with three neutrino families",
    "the oscillation probability between arbitrary flavor states can be written as @xmath49 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\delta m_{kj}^2r}{4e}\\right ) , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the distance traveled since the neutrinos were created , and @xmath51 is the neutrino energy .",
    "for the case of atmospheric neutrinos , the factor @xmath52 is quite small as compared with the case of solar neutrinos .",
    "thus , the term in eq .",
    "( [ genprob ] ) with a small @xmath34 ( henceforth referred to as the snp value , @xmath53 or @xmath54 ) can be neglected .",
    "when this small snp term involves @xmath35 we get @xmath55 where we use the approximation @xmath56 . from @xcite we know that the best fit between data and the oscillation hypothesis occurs at @xmath57 .",
    "this means that the lowest possible value of the heaviest mass state is @xmath58 .    in fig .",
    "[ amplatm ] we have plotted the amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ atmsmalld21 ] ) for solutions  1 and 2 .",
    "one should keep in mind that the approximation leading to eq .",
    "( [ atmsmalld21 ] ) is only satisfied close to the diagonal , @xmath59 . for solution  1",
    ", an unrealistically large @xmath25 would be needed to get an acceptable @xmath60 mixing . for solution  2 , we observe that large @xmath60 mixing could be reached for values of @xmath35 which are marginally compatible with the solar - neutrino constraints .",
    "we also note that the @xmath35 which is required for the msw effect will allow a larger amplitude for atmospheric - neutrino transitions than a mass - squared difference relevant for the vacuum oscillation solution to the snp , since the msw effect requires a larger @xmath20 .",
    "[ amplatm ]    when @xmath36 assumes the snp value , i.e. , @xmath61 , then the atmospheric @xmath62 transition probability can be written as @xmath63 instead of ( [ atmsmalld21 ] ) , where we have used the approximation @xmath64 .",
    "the maximal amplitude for this oscillation is about 0.5 for both mixing solutions .",
    "this value is too low to be of real interest .    in summary ,",
    "the atmospheric - neutrino data favor parameters corresponding to solution  2 with @xmath65 .",
    "they also favor the msw solution for the solar - neutrino problem , since this mechanism requires a larger @xmath20 , and thus a larger amplitude for atmospheric - neutrino oscillations .",
    "vacuum oscillations provide a plausible solution to the solar - neutrino problem @xcite . in this scenario , the length of the relevant oscillation cycle ( see eq .",
    "( [ genprob ] ) ) is about one sun - earth distance , i.e. @xmath66  m. the corresponding @xmath34 is several orders of magnitude smaller than the one which is relevant for atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "as mentioned , it will be either @xmath35 or @xmath36 which is relevant for solar neutrinos .",
    "thus , the allowed values of @xmath36 will be of the order relevant for either atmospheric or solar neutrinos .",
    "one necessary condition for acceptable fit between data and the vacuum oscillation hypothesis is that the smallest @xmath67 .",
    "the other independent mass - squared difference is held fixed at @xmath68 , in order to be able to accommodate the atmospheric neutrino data . to find the optimal mixing matrix we have to search through a large number of values for the mass ratios @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which we do by varying @xmath19 and @xmath35 .",
    "the interesting region is here close to the diagonal in the @xmath19@xmath20 plane ( see fig .  [ sol1 - 2 ] ) .",
    "the best fit is achieved at @xmath69 , @xmath70 which gives @xmath71 .",
    "this @xmath46-value is about 0.1% higher than the value obtained in an analysis where @xmath4 and @xmath34 are treated as independent .",
    "this good agreement is explained by the high sensitivity of the mixing matrix to the mass values .",
    "[ ue1ue2ue3 ] shows how the relevant mixing elements depend on @xmath19 when @xmath35 and @xmath72 are held fixed at @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , the mixing solutions are equal for @xmath75 . for solution  1 , @xmath76 , which means no @xmath47 for atmospheric neutrinos . for solution  2",
    "this amplitude is @xmath77 .",
    "this value is unchanged over a broad range of mass values , including the best fit value for the solar neutrino solution . in fig .",
    "[ chik ] we have plotted the @xmath46 values corresponding to fig .  [ ue1ue2ue3 ] .",
    "when @xmath19 is reduced beyond the best - fit value , the mixing matrix approaches the identity matrix , hence the fit becomes poor .",
    "[ ue1ue2ue3 ]    [ chik ]      in this case we can not get an equally good fit for solar neutrinos as we had for small @xmath35 . it turns out that the best fit is achieved when we , in the expression ( [ genprob ] ) , have vanishing amplitude for the oscillation factors containing the largest @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "this can not be achieved within the model , neither for solution  1 nor for solution  2 , see fig .",
    "[ sol1 - 2 ] . for solution",
    "1 the best fit gives @xmath79 , while for solution  2 one gets @xmath80 , with the best fit result @xmath81 . also , the relevant amplitude for atmospheric neutrino oscillations would be rather low in this case .",
    "if we consider only the snp , none of the best fits can be excluded .",
    "the best - fit point is achieved with small @xmath35 and at practically the same mass values for solutions  1 and 2 . including atmospheric neutrino data ,",
    "the preferred solution would be small @xmath35 and solution  2 .",
    "but the maximum possible oscillation amplitude for @xmath47 is only 0.4 , so the vacuum oscillation solution to the snp is disfavored by the model in @xcite . on the other hand , the recoil spectrum has an enhancement at high energies , as suggested by the data ( see fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] ) .",
    "for an exponential solar density , the three - flavor msw equations have recently been solved analytically for arbitrary masses @xcite . here ,",
    "since we assume two widely separated values of @xmath34 , we use the more conventional approach @xcite .",
    "this allows for a numerical comparison of the two approaches .",
    "the agreement was found to be very good .",
    "for example , for ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) = ( 0.002 , 0.01 , 0.057 )  ev and @xmath82  mev , the two approaches give @xmath83 survival probabilities of 0.668 and 0.660 .",
    "for some of the mass points we also check the exponential solar density approximation against the solar density profile calculated in a standard solar model @xcite , by performing numerical integrations on the latter .",
    "the agreement is within a few percent .    in the two - generation msw case",
    "where the angle and mass - squared difference are varied independently , one arrives at two possible solutions in the parameter space spanned by @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "there is one region with low @xmath46 at small angles , and another minimum at large angles @xcite .",
    "as we will see , this is also the case for the model in @xcite .    for solar neutrinos ,",
    "solutions  1 and 2 are nearly identical for the masses relevant at the best - fit point",
    ". therefore we will divide the presentation of our results into two parts , small @xmath35 and small @xmath36 .      for small values of @xmath25 and very small values of @xmath24",
    "we get @xmath86 for both mixing solutions .",
    "these are practically equivalent for solar neutrinos , both of them have a best fit with @xmath87 at @xmath88 , @xmath89 , where we have imposed @xmath90 .",
    "the latter quantity is held fixed at this value , which is compatible with the atmospheric neutrino data @xcite . because it is large compared to the snp - relevant @xmath35 , its exact value is , within the uncertainty , unimportant for the solar - neutrino analysis .",
    "these mass values correspond to small mixing angle , see eq .",

    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ sma - lma ] ( left panel ) how @xmath38 and @xmath46 vary when @xmath19 is slightly perturbed around its best - fit value .",
    "[ sma - lma ]    ( 12,7.0 ) ( -2.0,0.0 )    as previously noted , for atmospheric neutrinos we consider only vacuum oscillations , due to the smallness of @xmath37 . in the parameter region shown in fig .",
    "[ sma - lma ] ( left panel ) , @xmath91 . from eq .",
    "( [ atmsmalld21 ] ) it follows that the @xmath47 oscillation amplitude is 0.05 and 0.6 for solutions  1 and 2 , respectively .",

    "we also note that the @xmath46 value is quite sensitive to the mass values @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "these two low-@xmath46 regions can be combined into a single plot , fig .",

    "no point in this figure gives a mass - squared difference @xmath100 outside of the 68% c.l .",
    "region given by @xcite .      in this case the mixing elements are far less sensitive to small changes in the mass ratios .",
    "and for this reason the mixing elements are less adjustable within the relevant values of the mass - squared differences . for solution  1",
    "we get a best fit @xmath101 .    for solution  2",

    "the super - kamiokande detector measures the recoil energy of the scattered electrons coming from the process @xmath104 @xcite . for each of the solar sources , the form of the neutrino energy spectrum is measured in laboratories , and is independent of the total flux .",
    "thus , the super - kamiokande measurements of the upper part of the @xmath105 energy spectrum gives restrictions on the neutrino parameters , independent of solar models .",
    "if an energy dependent suppression of the flux should be established by such a method , it would be a very strong hint for neutrino oscillations because it would in principle not involve the uncertainties associated with solar models .",

    "we have tried to reproduce the observed spectrum within three scenarios : the vacuum , sma , and lma solution .",
    "these are actually all acceptable , but , as concerns the spectrum , the vacuum and sma solutions are favored .",
