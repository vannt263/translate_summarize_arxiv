    "located at a distance of 1.9 kpc @xcite , the orbital period of the system is 8.96  d ( @xcite , @xcite ) , implying that the neutron star orbit is embedded in the companion wind .",
    "the structure of the supergiant wind has been studied at different wavelengths , by means of ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy ( @xcite , @xcite ) and x  ray spectroscopic studies at different orbital phases ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these studies indicate the presence of both cold and hot gas components in the system , consistent with photoionization of the stellar wind produced by the x  ray pulsar , leading to the formation of a so - called photoionization wake trailing the neutron star ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , confirmed by simulations ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the x  ray emission of  is persistent at a level of 10@xmath5  erg  s@xmath3 , although variable ( within a factor of @xmath010 ) , showing rare giant flares together with so - called off - states , that manifest themselves as flux drops lasting a few pulse periods ( @xcite , @xcite ) . the observed variability is indicative of the presence of massive clumps in the supergiant wind ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "we have considered only the pointings in which  was within @xmath6  from the centre and with a duration @xmath71ks .",
    "the raw data were downloaded from the isdc data centre for astrophysics into our local /ibis data base @xcite .",
    "standard analysis has been applied using osa 10.0 software package .",
    "we produced individual pointing images ( @xmath0ks ) and the associated detected source lists in the 2250kev energy band , as well as light - curves binned over 100s in the 2250kev band .",
    "the energy range was chosen to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio while minimizing the instrumental low threshold fluctuations @xcite .",

    "we refer to that paper for more details on the hard x  ray emission properties of vela x1 , as observed by . here",
    ", we concentrate on the orbital distribution of the source s off - states .",
    "we considered all  data ( spanning about 10 years ) where  was detected at the imaging level ( @xmath0ks ) .",
    "indeed , non - detections at imaging level are found only during x - ray eclipses .",
    "we then extracted the hard x  ray light curves ( 2250 kev ) from these pointings , adopting a bin time of 100  s.    we found that , outside the eclipses , the source was not detected by  ( implying a hard x  ray observed luminosity , l@xmath9@xmath103@xmath110@xmath2  erg  s@xmath3 ) during short time intervals ( lasting from 100 s to a few hundred seconds ) .",
    "we will refer to these non - detections as `` off - states '' or `` dips '' , regardless of the cause of diminished flux ( similarly to the definition assumed by @xcite , who studied a subsample of  data of , at early times of the mission ) .    assuming the ephemeris reported in @xcite , we studied the distribution of these off - states along the orbit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : off ] we compare the off - states distribution with the occurrences of the source detections ( both at 100 s level ) along the orbit .",
    "we found two remarkable features in the off - state distribution ( red solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : off ] ) : the first is that off - states occur at any orbital phase ; the second and , more important , is that they cluster near the eclipse , but with an asymmetric profile : at late orbital phases , approaching the eclipse , the off - states are more numerous and span a broader phase interval than during the eclipse egress , where the peak in the off - states distribution is narrower .    to quantify this effect , we rebinned the off - states orbital distribution adopting a bin size of @xmath11 = 0.01 , and fitted this distribution ( assuming an uncertainty on the @xmath12  axis of @xmath13 ) with a model consisting of two exponential functions ( proportional to @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) together with a constant function , finding two significantly different exponents : @xmath16 = @xmath17 and @xmath18= @xmath19 , near eclipse egress ( @xmath20=0.1 - 0.2 ) and eclipse ingress ( @xmath20=0.7 - 0.9 ) , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that two different types of off - states co - exist in : the ones uniformly distributed along the orbit and the ones more concentrated near the x  ray eclipse , with a broader coverage in orbital phases near eclipse ingress than near eclipse egress .",
    "the first kind of dips occurring at any orbital phase can be explained by intrinsic x  ray variability that causes the source to be un - detected by . when observed with more sensitive instruments below 10 kev",
    ", off - states usually show a spectral softening , thus suggesting that they are not simply due to obscuration by a dense wind clump passing in front of the x  ray pulsar , but by a change in the accretion regime or by the onset of a propeller effect .",
    "these dips have been studied in detail by several authors ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and have been found also in other accreting x  ray pulsars ( even in supergiant fast x ",
    "ray transients , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the second kind of dips , asymmetric and clustered around the eclipses , could be discovered only by taking advantage of the long - term observations of vela  x1 available with ibis / isgri .",
    "this result points to a different mechanism , not intrinsic to the x  ray source .",
    "indeed , the orbit is almost circular and can not induce any variability in the accretion rate leading to dips preferentially seen at certain phases .",
    "moreover , eclipse in  occurs near periastron ( e.g. fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "more likely , the two peaks in the off - states distribution near @xmath21@xmath20=0.1 and 0.9 probe the innermost denser regions of the supergiant wind .",
    "the larger orbital extent of dip occurrence in the pre - eclipse region can be induced by the passage into the line of sight of a large - scale _ ionized _ wind structure , able to produce a drop in the x  ray flux by scattering .",
    "this structure can be naturally associated with the photoionized wake ( see below ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "dips in the light curve of  have been observed since the early 1970s : in two orbital cycles observed with @xmath22 ( 1.2 - 19.8 kev ) four irregular dips were detected ( with two dips at similar late orbital phases in both cycles ) and an association with the obscuration by an accretion wake was proposed ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "simulations by @xcite have shown that three different wind structures are present in the stellar wind , excited by the presence of the accreting neutron star : the _ accretion wake _ , the _ tidal stream _ and the _ photoionization wake_. a sketch of these three wind structures in vela x1 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the _ accretion wake _ around the neutron star can affect the column density variations along the orbit only around @xmath20=0.40.5 orbital phases .",
    "the _ tidal stream _ is a permanent wind enhancement structure that is a source of strong orbital phase - dependent attenuation of soft x ",
    "rays , expected to produce a higher hydrogen column density from phase @xmath20=0.5 up to the x-ray eclipse at phases @xmath20=0.9 - 1.1 .",
    "the production of the tidal stream depends on the orbital separation , being more evident in closer orbits @xcite .",
    "an enhancement of the neutral absorption column density towards the neutron star at late orbital phases has been indeed observed in   ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "finally , the wind structure is strongly influenced by the neutron star orbit not only because of gravity but also because of the accretion x  ray emission produced by the compact object , that photoionizes the wind reducing the ability of the wind to be radiatively driven @xcite .",
    "this effect decreases the wind velocity near the neutron star and produces a wake of gas trailing behind the ionized wind , where faster wind collides with slower wind , leading to the formation of a so - called _ photoionization wake _",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for a photoionization wake in  has been found also from optical spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the orbital distribution of off - states we observed with  is consistent with the orbital phases spanned by the tidal stream discussed by @xcite and by the photoionization wake @xcite , that somehow overlap .",
    "thanks to the accumulation of a huge amount of  data , able to cover the entire orbit several times , we could study the orbital dependence of the occurrence of the off - states , finding an asymmetric distribution .",
    "we explain it with the presence of a large - scale _ ionized _ wind structure that scatters hard x ",
    "rays out of the line of sight , producing short off - states .",
    "scattering by the ambient wind is also the physical mechanism explaining both the residual x ",
    "ray emission observed during the eclipse and the soft x ",
    "rays excess visible in  spectrum ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our finding of an asymmetry in the off - state distribution , with an enhanced number of off - states at late orbital phases , complements previous studies on the circumstellar matter in , starting from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to the most recent works on the neutral hydrogen column density variations along the orbit as observed by asm/@xmath23 @xcite and maxi data @xcite in much softer x  ray bands .",
    "a hardening of the x  ray emission at late orbital phases was found by these authors , explained with denser gas into the line of sight due to the presence of a photoionization wake , with a column density , n@xmath24=1 - 3@xmath110@xmath25  @xmath26 . here , we were able to map the ionized component of this gas stream that produces a significant scattering effect at hard x ",
    "rays , outside the eclipse , only detectable after the accumulation of a decade of  observations .",
    "we note that a similar effect was observed in  hard x  ray data of cyg  x1 : this hmxb black hole was simultaneously observed at soft and hard x ",
    "rays , finding that dips are mainly present in the soft x  ray band at upper conjunction due to photoelectric absorption in the focused stellar wind , whereas in  simultaneous data , a scattering effect is evident @xcite .",
    "these authors suggested that these features are due to clumps in the focused wind which are both highly ionized and with ( near-)neutral cores .",
    "the neutral clump cores produce dips by photoelectric absorption in the soft x ",
    "rays , while their ionized halo produces the attenuation at hard x  rays .",
    "we conclude here that a similar scattering effect is indeed at work in  too .    ) .",

    "fig : good_orbit ] the long - term orbital light curve of vela x1 at hard x  rays ( 2250 kev ) , as obtained by ibis / isgri in this work .",
    "the curve is consistent with what found by @xcite who analysed a more contained  data - set in the similar energy band 2060 kev . the comparison of this long - term folded light curve with the off - states orbital distribution ( fig .",
    "1 ) shows that the pattern we discovered and present in this work is clearly visible _ only plotting the off - states distribution _ , rather than the more standard orbital light curve that is dominated by the source variability .",
    "we have analysed about 10 years of  data .",
    "we have reported here on the first evidence at hard x  rays ( 2250 kev ) of an orbital dependence of the off - states distribution in  ( time intervals when the source is undetected by i.e. l@xmath9@xmath103@xmath110@xmath2  erg  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "their orbital distribution is asymmetric : the off - states cluster near the x  ray eclipse , with a broader orbital distribution before the eclipse than after it , covering the orbital phase range @xmath20=0.7 - 0.9 .",
    "we exclude an intrinsically fainter x  ray flux producing more non - detections with  at these orbital phases , given the orbital ( almost circular ) geometry .",
    "moreover , the periastron , and not the apastron , is located near the eclipse phases , thus potentially producing the opposite effect of an enhanced x",
    " ray luminosity .",
    "more likely , the orbital asymmetry of the off - states distribution is indicative of a higher density of ionized material trailing the neutron star along its orbit , causing an attenuation of hard x  ray flux into the line of sight at late orbital phases .",
    "we associated this extra scattering with an ionized large - scale wind structure , very likely the so - called photoionization wake , which is expected to lie at similar orbital phases .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that  archival observations , mapping the off - states distribution along the  orbit many times , can provide meaningful information on the structure of the supergiant _ ionized _ wind at large scales .",
