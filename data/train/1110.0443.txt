    "liquid argon ( lar ) time projection chambers ( tpcs ) seem to be a very promising technology for the next generation of neutrino detectors .",
    "this next generation will require multi - kilo - ton detectors , and lar tpcs are an attractive option .",
    "these detectors offer high detection efficiencies and excellent background rejection and they appear to be scalable .",
    "however , the scalability has not yet been fully demonstrated .",
    "the argoneut experiment , a @xmath0 lar tpc was a first step to a @xmath1 program in the united states .",
    "the main goal of argoneut was to gain experience building and operating lar tpcs .",
    "in addition , the experiment collected data in an energy range relevant to neutrino oscillation physics . these data were used to develop simulation and analysis tools and the first physics results extracted from the data were recently presented .",
    "a review of the argoneut experiment will be given as well as a description of the data analysis and an overview of the first results on @xmath2 charged - current ( cc ) inclusive differential cross - section measurement by argoneut .",
    "the argoneut tpc is a 90 cm @xmath3 40 cm @xmath3 48 cm rectangular volume containing @xmath0 of lar active volume .",
    "the tpc was positioned in a vacuum jacketed cryostat .",
    "left picture in figure [ fig1 ] shows the tpc about to enter the cryostat .",
    "the tpc consists of three wire planes with 240 wires each , separated by 4 mm .",
    "the innermost wire plane has vertical wire orientation and was not instrumented .",
    "the second plane , the instrumented induction plane , has wires oriented at @xmath4 and the third plane , the collection plane , has wires oriented at @xmath5 .",
    "the wire planes can be seen in the left panel of figure [ fig1 ] on the right of the tpc .",
    "a 25kv voltage was applied to the cathode , creating a 500v / cm electric field .",
    "more details on the detector , its electronics and the cryogenics can be found in @xcite .",

    "argoneut ran stably for over five months , collecting an impressive sample of neutrino and anti - neutrino data .",
    "the two weeks of neutrino data has started to be analyzed and the simulations predictions for the @xmath2 cc - inclusive differential cross section were reported here .",
    "more results will be presented in a paper in preparation .",
    "future analysis will allow channel - specific cross - section measurements .",
    "the sample of anti - neutrino data , containing about fifteen times more statistics , will also be analyzed in the near future .",
    "+ this measurement also demonstrates that the larsoft software is operational and ready for further analyses .",
    "the argoneut data will also be used to look in details at fsis to study nuclear effects .",
