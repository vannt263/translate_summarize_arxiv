    "obviously , the prerequisite to such procedures is the accurate evaluation of the conductivity in the metallic state or in the state of the pinned cdw / sdw , and this simple , yet not completely solved , problem is in the focus of our interest here .    actually , using the microscopic transverse response theory , lee , rice and anderson have found that the single - particle optical conductivity in the ordered cdw state with the negligible small number of scattering centers is given in terms of the semiconducting current - current correlation function which describes excitations across the gap @xcite .",

    "@xcite , mahan has further shown that an alternative , so - called force - force correlation function method gives a good description of the ( high - frequency ) optical processes in both metallic and semiconducting systems , including various excitations within the conduction band and across the ( pseudo)gaps , but also fails to reach correctly the @xmath1 limit , requiring a specific @xmath2 field - theory approach @xcite .    also important",

    "<S> the electrodynamic features of the multiband model are examined using the transverse equation of motion approach in order to give the explanation of several long - standing problems . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the exact summation of the most singular terms in powers of @xmath0 leads to the total optical conductivity which , in the zero - frequency limit , reduces to the results of the boltzmann equation , for both the metallic and semiconducting two - band regime . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed calculations are carried out for the quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) two - band model corresponding to imperfect charge - density - wave ( cdw ) nesting . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the present treatment of the impurity scattering processes gives the dc conductivity of the ordered cdw state in agreement with the experimental observation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the dc and optical conductivity are calculated numerically for a few typical q1d cases . </S>"
