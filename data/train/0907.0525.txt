    "there are a number of scenarios for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the most famous one is the supersymmetric scenario .",
    "recently , alternative one called the little higgs scenario has been proposed @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the higgs boson is regarded as a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson associated with a global symmetry at some higher scale .",
    "a @xmath0 symmetry called t - parity is imposed on the models to satisfy constraints from electroweak precision measurements @xcite . under the parity ,",
    "new particles are assigned to be t - odd ( i.e. with a t - parity of @xmath1 ) , while the sm particles are t - even .",
    "the lightest t - odd particle is stable and provides a good candidate for dark matter . in this article , we focus on the littlest higgs model with t - parity as a simple and typical example of models implementing both the little higgs mechanism and t - parity .    in order to test the little higgs model , precise determinations of properties of little higgs partners are mandatory , because these particles are directly related to the cancellation of quadratically divergent corrections to the higgs mass term .",
    "in particular , measurements of heavy gauge boson masses , little higgs partners for gauge bosons , are quite important .",
    "since heavy gauge bosons acquire mass terms through the breaking of the global symmetry , precise measurements of their masses allow us to determine the most important parameter of the model , namely the vacuum expectation value of the breaking .",
    "we studied the measurement accuracy of masses of the heavy gauge bosons at the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "in addition , the sensitivity to the vacuum expectation value ( f ) was estimated . in this paper ,",
    "the status of the study is shown , and the detail of this study is described in @xcite .",
    "in order to perform a numerical simulation at ilc , we need to choose a representative point in the parameter space of the littlest higgs model with t - parity .",
    "firstly , the model parameters should satisfy the current electroweak precision data .",
    "in addition , the cosmological observation of dark matter relics also gives important information .",
    "thus , we consider not only the electroweak precision measurements but also the wmap observation @xcite to choose a point in the parameter space . we have selected a representative point where higgs mass and @xmath2 are 134 gev and 580 gev , respectively . at the representative point , we have obtained @xmath3 of 1.05 .",
    "the masses of the heavy gauge bosons are ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) = ( 81.9 gev , 368 gev , 369 gev ) , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9  are the little higgs partners of a photon , z boson , and w boson , respectively . here , @xmath7  plays the role of dark matter in this model @xcite . since all the heavy gauge bosons are lighter than 500 gev , it is possible to generate them at ilc .",
    "r0.4        there are four processes whose final states consist of two heavy gauge bosons : @xmath10 @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the first process is undetectable , thus not considered in this article .",
    "the cross sections of the other processes are shown in table [ table : xsections ] .",
    "since @xmath15 is less than 500 gev , @xmath12  can be produced at the @xmath16 gev . at @xmath17 tev",
    ", we can observe @xmath18  with large cross section .",
    "we , hence , concentrate on @xmath19  at @xmath16 gev and @xmath20  at @xmath17 tev .",
    "feynman diagrams for the signal processes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "note that @xmath8  decays into @xmath21 , and @xmath22  decays into @xmath23 with almost 100% branching fractions .",
    "we have used madgraph @xcite to generate @xmath19  at @xmath24 500 gev , while @xmath20  at @xmath24 1 tev and all the standard model events have been generated by physsim @xcite .",
    "we ignored the initial- and final - state radiation , beamstrahlung , and the beam energy spread for study of @xmath19  at @xmath24 500 gev , whereas their effects were considered for study of @xmath20  at @xmath24 1 tev where the beam energy spread is set to 0.14% for the electron beam and 0.07% for the positron beam .",
    "the finite crossing angle between the electron and positron beams was assumed to to be zero . in both event generators , the helicity amplitudes were calculated using the helas library @xcite , which allows us to deal with the effect of gauge boson polarizations properly .",
    "parton showering and hadronization have been carried out by using pythia6.4 @xcite , where final - state tau leptons are decayed by tauola @xcite in order to handle their polarizations correctly .",
    "the generated monte carlo events have been passed to a detector simulator called jsfquicksimulator , which implements the gld geometry and other detector - performance related parameters @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present simulation and analysis results for heavy gauge boson productions .",
    "the simulation has been performed at @xmath24 500 gev for the @xmath12  production and at @xmath24 1 tev for the @xmath18  production with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath25 .",
    "r0.35        @xmath7  and @xmath8  are produced with the cross section of 1.9 fb at the center of mass energy of 500 gev .",
    "since @xmath8  decays into @xmath7  and the higgs boson , the signature is a single higgs boson in the final state , mainly 2 jets from @xmath26 ( with a 55% branching ratio ) .",
    "we , therefore , define @xmath27  as our signal event . for background events ,",
    "contribution from light quarks was not taken into account because such events can be rejected to negligible level after requiring the existence of two @xmath28-jets , assuming a @xmath28-tagging efficiency of 80% for @xmath28-jets with 15% probability to misidentify a @xmath29-jet as a @xmath28-jet .",
    "this @xmath28-tagging performance was estimated by the full simulation , assuming a typical ilc detector .",
    "signal and background processes considered in this analysis are summarized in table [ tb : zhevlst ] .",
    "figure [ fig : evtdsp ] shows a typical @xmath12  event seen in the detector simulator .",
    "the clusters in the calorimeters are combined to form a jet if the two clusters satisfy @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the angle between momenta of two clusters , @xmath34 are their energies , and @xmath35 is the total visible energy .",
    "all events are forced to have two jets by adjusting @xmath36 .",
    "we have selected events with the reconstructed higgs mass in a window of @xmath37 gev .",
    "since higgs bosons coming from the @xmath38 fusion process have the transverse momentum ( @xmath39 ) mostly below w mass , @xmath39  is required to be above 80 gev in order to suppress the @xmath40  background . finally , multiplying the efficiency of double @xmath28-tagging ( @xmath41 )",
    ", we are left with 272 signal and 5,419 background events as shown in table [ tb : zhevlst ] , which corresponds to a signal significance of 3.7 ( @xmath42 ) standard deviations .",

    "the shaded area shows the unphysical region of @xmath43 gev.,width=377 ]    the masses of @xmath7  and @xmath8  bosons can be estimated from the edges of the distribution of the reconstructed higgs boson energies .",
    "this is because the maximum and minimum higgs boson energies ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) are written in terms of these masses ,    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the @xmath48 factor of the @xmath8  boson in the laboratory frame , while @xmath49 is the energy ( momentum ) of the higgs boson in the rest frame of the @xmath8  boson .",

    "figure [ fig : hene](a ) shows the energy distribution of the reconstructed higgs bosons with remaining backgrounds .",
    "the background events are subtracted from fig .",

    ". then , the endpoints , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , have been estimated by fitting the distribution with a line shape determined by a high statistics signal sample .",
    "the fit resulted in @xmath52 and @xmath53 to be @xmath54 gev and @xmath55 gev , respectively , which should be compared to their true values : 81.85 gev and 368.2 gev .",
    "figure [ fig : hene](b ) shows the probability contours for the masses of @xmath7  and @xmath8 .",
    "since the masses of the heavy gauge bosons are from the vacuum expectation value ( @xmath2 ) , @xmath2 can be determined by fitting the energy distribution of the reconstructed higgs bosons .",

    "signal and background processes considered in the analysis are summarized in table [ tb : whevlst ] .",
    "all events have been reconstructed as 4-jet events by adjusting the cut on y - values . in order to identify the two @xmath58 bosons from @xmath22",
    "decays , two jet - pairs have been selected so as to minimize a @xmath60 function , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the invariant mass of the first ( second ) 2-jet system paired as a @xmath58 candidate , @xmath63 is the true @xmath58 mass ( 80.4 gev ) , and @xmath64 is the resolution for the @xmath58 mass ( 4 gev ) .",
    "we required @xmath65 to obtain well - reconstructed events .",

    "we have thus selected events with @xmath66  above 84 gev .",
