    "<S> -.35 in we use the high energy predictions of a qcd - inspired parameterization of all accelerator data on forward proton - proton and antiproton - proton scattering amplitudes , along with glauber theory , to predict proton  </S>",
    "<S> air cross sections at energies near @xmath0 30 tev . </S>",
    "<S> the parameterization of the proton - proton cross section incorporates analyticity and unitarity , and demands that the asymptotic proton is a black disk of soft partons . by comparing with the p - air cosmic ray measurements , our analysis results in a constraint on the inclusive particle production cross section .     </S>",
    "<S> @=11  </S>",
    "<S> @=12    .65 in    cosmic ray experiments measure the penetration in the atmosphere of particles with energies in excess of those accelerated by existing machines  interestingly , their energy range covers the energy of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and extends beyond it . </S>",
    "<S> however , extracting proton  proton cross sections from cosmic ray observations is far from straightforward  @xcite . by a variety of experimental techniques , cosmic ray experiments </S>",
    "<S> map the atmospheric depth at which cosmic ray initiated showers develop . </S>",
    "<S> the measured shower attenuation length ( @xmath1 ) is not only sensitive to the interaction length of the protons in the atmosphere ( @xmath2 ) , with @xmath3 but also depends on the rate at which the energy of the primary proton is dissipated into electromagnetic shower energy observed in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the latter effect is parameterized in eq.([eq : lambda_m ] ) by the parameter @xmath4 ; @xmath5 is the proton mass and @xmath6 the inelastic proton - air cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath4 depends on the inclusive particle production cross section in nucleon and meson interactions on the light nuclear target of the atmosphere and its energy dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we here ignored the fact that particles in the cosmic ray `` beam '' may be nuclei , not just protons . </S>",
    "<S> experiments allow for this by omitting from their analysis showers which dissipate their energy high in the atmosphere , a signature that the initial energy is distributed over the constituents of a nucleus .    </S>",
    "<S> the extraction of the pp cross section from the cosmic ray data is a two step process . </S>",
    "<S> first , one calculates the @xmath7-air total cross section from the measured inelastic cross section @xmath8 next , the glauber method@xcite is used to transform the measured value of @xmath6 into a proton  proton total cross section @xmath9 ; all the necessary steps are calculable in the theory . in eq.([eq : spa ] ) the measured cross section for particle production is supplemented with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the elastic and quasi - elastic cross section , respectively , as calculated by the glauber theory , to obtain the total cross section @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent relation between @xmath6 and @xmath9 involves the slope of the forward scattering amplitude for elastic @xmath13 scattering , @xmath14 , @xmath15_{t=0 } \\,,\\ ] ] and is shown in fig.[fig : p - air ] , which plots @xmath16 against @xmath9 , for 5 curves of different values of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this summarizes the reduction procedure from @xmath6 to @xmath9  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also plotted in fig.[fig : p - air ] is a curve of @xmath16 _ vs. _ @xmath9 which will be discussed later .    </S>",
    "<S> a significant drawback of the method is that one needs a model of proton  air interactions to complete the loop between the measured attenuation length @xmath1 and the cross section @xmath6 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , _ the value of @xmath4 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lambda_m ] ) . a proposal to minimize the impact of theory is the topic of this letter . </S>",
    "<S> we have constructed a qcd - inspired parameterization of the forward proton  proton and proton  antiproton scattering amplitudes@xcite which is analytic , unitary and fits all data of @xmath17 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 , the ratio of the real - to - imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude ; see fig.[fig : ppcurves ] . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that all 3 quantities are simultaneously fitted . </S>",
    "<S> using vector meson dominance and the additive quark models , it accommodates a wealth of data on photon - proton and photon - photon interactions without the introduction of new parameters@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because the model is both unitary and analytic , it has high energy predictions that are essentially theory  independent . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it also _ simultaneously _ fits @xmath9 and @xmath16 , forcing a relationship between the two . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the @xmath16 _ vs. _ @xmath9 prediction of the model is shown as the dashed curve in fig.[fig : p - air ] . </S>",
    "<S> the dot corresponds to our prediction of @xmath9 and @xmath16 at @xmath19 = 30 tev . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen to be slightly below the curve for 490 mb , the lower limit of the fly s eye measurement , which was made at @xmath20 30 tev . </S>",
    "<S> the percentage error in the prediction of @xmath9 at @xmath21 tev is @xmath22% , due to the statistical error in the fitting parameters ( see references @xcite,@xcite ) .    in fig.[fig : </S>",
    "<S> sigpp_p - air ] , we have plotted the values of @xmath9 _ vs. _ @xmath6 that are deduced from the intersections of the @xmath16-@xmath9 curve with the @xmath6 curves of fig.[fig : p - air ] . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : sigpp_p - air ] allows the conversion of the measured @xmath6 to @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the percentage error in @xmath6 is @xmath23 % near @xmath24 mb , due to the error in @xmath9 from the model parameter uncertainties .    </S>",
    "<S> our prediction for the total cross section @xmath9 as a function of energy is confronted with all of the accelerator and cosmic ray measurements@xcite in fig.[fig : sigtodorpp ] . for inclusion in fig.[fig : sigtodorpp ] , we have calculated the cosmic ray values of @xmath9 from the _ published _ experimental values of @xmath6 , using the results of fig.[fig : sigpp_p - air ] . </S>",
    "<S> we note the systematic underestimate of the cosmic ray points , roughly about the level of one standard deviation .    </S>",
    "<S> it is at this point important to recall eq.([eq : lambda_m ] ) and consider the fact that the extraction of @xmath6 from the measurement of @xmath1 requires a determination of the parameter @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the measured depth @xmath25 at which a shower reaches maximum development in the atmosphere , which is the basis of the cross section measurement in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is a combined measure of the depth of the first interaction , which is determined by the inelastic cross section , and of the subsequent shower development , which has to be corrected for . </S>",
    "<S> the position of @xmath25 also directly affects the rate of shower attenuation with atmospheric depth which is the alternative procedure for extracting @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> .    the model dependent rate of shower development and its fluctuations are the origin of the deviation of @xmath4 from unity in eq.([eq : lambda_m ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> its values range from 1.5 for a model where the inclusive cross section exhibits feynman scaling , to 1.1 for models with large scaling violations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between data and experiment in fig.[fig : sigtodorpp ] is further confused by the fact that the agasa@xcite and fly s eye@xcite experiments used different values of @xmath4 in the analysis of their data , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , _ </S>",
    "<S> agasa used @xmath26 and fly s eye used @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> we therefore decided to match the data to our prediction and extract a common value for @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this neglects the possibility that @xmath4 may show a weak energy dependence over the range measured . by combining the results of fig.[fig : ppcurves](a ) and fig.[fig : sigpp_p - air ] , we can plot our prediction of @xmath6 _ vs. _ @xmath19 . to obtain @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> we leave it as a free parameter and make a @xmath28 fit to the rescaled high energy cosmic ray data for @xmath6 . in fig.[fig : p - aircorrected2 ] we have replotted the published high energy data for @xmath6 , against our prediction of @xmath6 _ vs. _ @xmath19 , using the common value of @xmath29 , obtained from a @xmath28 fit . </S>",
    "<S> the error of @xmath30 is the statistical error of the @xmath28 fit , whereas the error of @xmath31 is the systematic error due to the error in the prediction of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , we have an excellent fit , with good agreement between agasa and fly s eye . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis gives @xmath32 for 6 degrees of freedom ( the low @xmath28 is probably due to overestimates of experimental errors ) . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the improved fit of the cosmic ray data has no effect on the fit to the accelerator data .    </S>",
    "<S> our result for @xmath4 is interesting  it is close to the value of @xmath33 obtained using the sibyll simulation@xcite for inclusive particle production . </S>",
    "<S> this represents a consistency check in the sense that our model for forward scattering amplitudes and sybill share the same underlying physics . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the total cross section with energy to a black disk of soft partons is the shadow of increased particle production which is modeled by the production of ( mini)-jets in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the @xmath4 values of 1.20 and 1.33 could be understood because the experimental measurement integrates showers in a relatively wide energy range , which tends to increase the value of @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> we predict @xmath34 mb for the total cross section at lhc energy ( 14 tev ) , where the error is due to the statistical errors of the fitting parameters . in the near term </S>",
    "<S> , we look forward to the possibility of repeating this analysis with the higher statistics of the hires  @xcite cosmic ray experiment that is currently in progress and the auger  @xcite observatory . </S>"
