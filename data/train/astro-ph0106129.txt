    "spirals were more gas - rich in the past and mergers were more frequent .",
    "the origin of elliptical galaxies is still a matter of debate .",
    "were their stars formed `` all at once '' in the early universe  either in a monolithic collapse scenario or in some `` coordinated effort '' in building blocks that later merged stellardynamically  or do they have significant populations of stars formed in one major spiral - spiral merger or in a series of hierarchical mergers that still involved gas to power star formation .",

    "i present results from our new set of evolutionary synthesis models for simple (= single burst ) stellar populations ( * ssp*s ) of various metallicities , and in a 2@xmath1 step i combine these results with the information we have about the redshift evolution of spiral galaxies ism abundances .",
    "the aim is to provide a grid of color and luminosity distributions of any secondary gc population formed at some time in the past for comparison with observations .",
    "using padova isochrones including the thermal pulsing agb phase ( * tp - agb * ) we obtain the time evolution of spectra ( 90  160 @xmath2 ) , colors , luminosities ( u ... k ) , and stellar mass loss from ages @xmath3 yr for ssps of 5 different metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath4 ( schulz , fritze  v. a. , fricke 2001 )",
    ". inclusion of the tp - agb phase in the stellar evolutionary tracks is very important for the ( v - i ) and ( v - k ) colors at ages @xmath5 yr , more so for higher metallicities than for lower ones .",
    "for @xmath6 it makes colors redder by @xmath7 mag in ( v - i ) and @xmath8 mag in ( v - k ) at ages @xmath9 yr .",
    "this means that ages determined for young star clusters from hst ( v - i ) colors and models without tp - agb are strongly overestimated .    without going into any details ,",
    "we only recall here that  compared to solar metallicity  ssps at lower metallicities are brighter in ubvri and fainter in k , are bluer and have lower mass loss , lower m / l@xmath10 and higher m / l@xmath11 values all through their time evolution ( fritze  v. a. 2000 ) .",
    "models are shown to not only correctly reproduce the observed gc colors after a hubble time but also the empirical calibrations like ( b - v ) or ( v - i ) vs [ fe / h ] for milky way ( * mw * ) gcs",

    "these low metallicity gcs are close to the mw halo clusters at all ages . at intermediate metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath16",
    ", clusters also start out bluer than mw gcs in ( b - v ) and ( v - i ) , they cross the mw gc colors around ages of 2 gyr and become redder thereafter . in ( v - k ) they are slightly redder than mw gcs from the very beginning .",
    "high metallicity clusters [ fe / h]@xmath17 already have mean mw gc colors at ages around 1 gyr in ( b - v ) and ( v - i ) and get considerably redder thereafter . in ( v - k ) they already are redder than mw gcs at 0.3 gyr .    note that certain combinations in age and metallicity , that are indistinguishable in optical colors due to the well - known age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy , do visibly split up in ( v - k ) .",
    "* we conclude * that an observed unimodal gc color distribution need not necessarily imply that all gcs have the same age and metallicity . two ( or more ) gc populations may hide in one peak . in case of an observed bimodal gc color distribution",
    "it is not _ a priori _ clear if a red or blue peak is due to an older / younger or metal - rich / metal - poor cluster population .",
    "individual cluster spectroscopy is required to clarify the situation .    in fritze  v. a. ( 2001 ) we also study the luminosity functions ( * lf*s ) of these secondary gcs in their time evolution .",
    "we assume a mass function similar to that of the mw gcs and gauge the luminosity of an ssp with [ fe / h]=-1.35 to their mean @xmath18 to see for which combinations of age and metallicity the lf of a model gc population could be distinguished from the observed mw gc lf .",
    "depending on the specific combinations of ages and metallicities all combinations are seen to appear for two gc populations : uni- and bimodal color distributions with uni- and bimodal lfs .",
    "in evolutionary synthesis models galaxies of various spectral types are parametrised by their respective star formation ( * sf * ) histories . starting from an initial gas cloud and specifying a sf history and an imf",
    ", our models simultaneously yield the spectrophotometric evolution of the stellar population and the chemical evolution in terms of ism abundances , both as a function of time and , for any kind of cosmological model , also as a function of redshift . following both aspects of galaxy evolution",
    "simultaneously allows to describe the evolution in a chemically consistent way , i.e. to monitor the initial (= gas phase ) abundance at which any star is born and follow it on a track and with yields appropriate for its metallicity ( fritze  v. a. 1999 ) .",
    "this gives results in good agreement with observed stellar metallicity distributions , template spectra , and hii region abundances of local galaxy types as well as with the observed redshift evolution of luminosities and colors ( mller et al .",
    "comparison with precise individual element abundances measured on high resolution spectra of damped ly@xmath19 absorbers for a series of elements ( fe , si , zn , cr , ni , s , al , mn ) shows good agreement with the redshift evolution of the absolute abundances in our spiral models over a redshift range from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "by @xmath22 models directly meet observed characteristic hii region abundances .",
    "the observed weak redshift evolution of abundances and the large scatter at any redshift are seen to be a consequence of the sf timescales in spirals and their differences from early to late - type spirals ( cf .",
    "lindner et al .",
    "1999 for details ) .",
    "optical properties of the models are in agreement with the large number of non - detections and with the properties of the few detected damped ly@xmath19 absorbers ( fritze  v. a. et al .",
    "hence , we believe that we reasonably understand the redshift evolution of spiral galaxies ism abundances over large lookback times , and in the following , i will use these to investigate the metallicities of hypothetic secondary populations of gcs forming from this ism in spiral ",
    "spiral mergers at various redshifts . combining with ssp models for the respective metallicities , the time evolution of colors and characteristic luminosities of these secondary gcs are obtained .    in fritze ",
    "v. a. & gerhard ( 1994 ) we predicted abundances for the young star clusters in the sc ",
    "sc merger remnant ngc 7252 to be @xmath23 .",
    "spectroscopy of the brightest clusters , i.e. those formed towards the end of the extended starburst , yielded abundances @xmath24 with some indication of @xmath19-element enhancement from the burst itself ( schweizer & seitzer 1993 , 1998 , fritze  v. a. & burkert 1995 ) in good agreement with model predictions .",
    "the redshift evolution of ism abundances for various spiral types shows that only a limited range of combinations between metallicity and age of secondary gcs is expected to result from mergers of normal spirals . despite a significant amount of scatter introduced by the metallicity differences among different spiral types at fixed redshift , a broad cosmic age ",
    "metallicity relation is found .",
    "the ism metallicity in spirals increases slowly with decreasing redshift .",
    "hence secondary gcs formed out of this gas are predicted to be the more metal - rich the later the merger , i.e. the younger the gcs are at the present time .",
    "ssp models have shown that metallicity effects on the evolution of a gc depend both on wavelength / color and on age .",
    "hence , it is the interplay of age and metallicity that determines the color and luminosity evolution .    in fig .",
    "1 we present the color distributions as predicted for today for secondary gcs that formed in spiral",
    " spiral mergers at various redshifts .",
    "we also plot the observed color distributions of mw halo gcs which we take as a reference for the primary gc population in our mergers .",
    "we assume the same intrinsic widths for the color distributions of primary and secondary cluster systems and plot a situation where both populations contain comparable numbers of clusters . in reality , however , the two peaks may have different heights according to the relative numbers of primary and secondary gcs .",
    "the number of secondary gcs will depend on the amount of gas available and on the cluster formation efficiency in the burst .",
    "a 2@xmath1 peak is easiest to detect if comparable in height to the primary .",
    "note that many  if not most  of the observed gc systems show a peak in their ( v - i ) distribution at or close to that of the mw halo gcs , suggesting a certain uniformity of primary gc systems .",
    "1 shows that the color distributions of secondary gcs are bluer than those of the mw gcs for all very early mergers at @xmath25 and sd - sd mergers at @xmath26 , they are hidden in the primary gc color distributions for sa - sa mergers at @xmath27 , sb - sb mergers at @xmath28 , and sd - sd mergers at @xmath29 .",
    "color distributions of secondary gcs finally are redder than those of mw gcs for sa - sa mergers at @xmath30 , sb - sb mergers at @xmath31 .",
    "it is very intriguing and a result of the restricted range of age ",
    "metallicity combinations in spiral mergers that lfs in all cases  even in those with clearly bimodal color distributions  are unimodal and narrow , thus `` saving '' this method of distance determination ( cf . fritze  v. a. 2001 ) . observed gc lfs , as well , are unimodal in several systems with bimodal color distributions ( e.g. m87 , ngc 4472 , ... ) .",
    "these first and very simplified models need to be extended to mergers among galaxies of different types , including gas - rich dwarfs .",
    "observationally it is very important to have imaging in more than two bands , and in particular in the nir , and to obtain spectra of reasonable numbers of gcs in both kinds of systems , those with bimodal and rich unimodal color distributions , to reveal if they contain different metallicity subpopulations that  for specific ages  may perfectly hide within one peak of the color distribution .",
