    "the cdf and 0  detectors at the fermilab tevatron collider collected data during the 1992 - 93 run ( `` run 1a '' ) corresponding to integrated luminosities of @xmath315  pb@xmath4 and @xmath320  pb@xmath4 for 0  and cdf respectively . in the 1994 - 95 run ( `` run 1b '' ) data sets of @xmath380  pb@xmath4 ( 0 ) and @xmath390  pb@xmath4 ( cdf ) were collected .",
    "the large tevatron data sets allow precise measurements of the  boson properties , such as its mass and width , and new studies of the physics of electroweak boson pair production .",
    "in this paper we present selected recent results on  boson physics from the analysis of a subset of these data , concentrating mainly on electroweak physics .",
    "theoretical aspects of  production at hadron colliders are covered in the talk by stirling at this conference .",
    "the measurement of the production cross - sections times branching ratios ( @xmath5 ) for the  and  bosons allows a determination of the width of the  boson and a comparison of and  boson production with qcd predictions .",
    "the latter are calculated to order @xmath6 and therefore , precision measurements of the cross sections are a test of radiative processes in qcd .",
    "measurements of the cross sections were made by 0  and cdf using the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 decay channels .",
    "events were selected from single lepton triggers and offline were required to contain a high  isolated lepton plus missing transverse energy (  events ) or two high  isolated leptons (  events ) .",
    "the 0  and cdf run 1a analyses are described in  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : mtev - mee ] shows the 0  preliminary run 1b transverse mass spectra for @xmath11 candidate events and the invariant mass spectra for @xmath12 candidate events .    = 9.5 cm    the values of @xmath5 were calculated by subtracting the background from the number of observed events and dividing by the acceptance , efficiency and integrated luminosity .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ table : xsec ] and are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec ] .",
    "the measurements agree well with the order @xmath6 qcd predictions ( van  neerven  @xcite ) of @xmath13  nb and @xmath14  nb , shown as the shaded bands in fig .",

    "are the results from the indirect measurements from lep and slc and the predictions of the sm for various higgs masses .",
    "the errors in the latter predictions are indicated by the width of the bands and are primarily due to the uncertainty in @xmath21 , the electromagnetic coupling strength at the  mass scale .",
    "although only small improvements to the indirect results from lep / slc data are expected , the direct measurements of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are expected to improve by factors of @xmath22 from future measurements  @xcite at the tevatron .",
    "this would lead to a prediction of the higgs mass at the level of @xmath23 .",
    "= 8 cm      on average @xmath25 valence quarks in the proton have higher momentum than @xmath26 valence quarks .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 bosons produced via @xmath28 are boosted predominantly along the proton direction and @xmath29 bosons from @xmath30 are boosted predominantly along the antiproton direction .",
    "this results in an asymmetry in the charged lepton rapidity distribution in @xmath24 events , defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of positively ( negatively ) charged leptons with rapidity @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34 decay asymmetry from the @xmath35 decay of the  must also be accounted for when studying @xmath36 .",
    "the importance of this measurement is that it is sensitive to the difference in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 quark distribution functions at very high @xmath37  ( @xmath38 ) and low @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the measurements therefore constrain the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) and are used to reduce the error in @xmath19 due to the uncertainty in the pdf s .",
    "the most recent measurements of this asymmetry from cdf are shown in figure  [ fig : cdf_wasym ] .",
    "the data include the run 1a+1b results with a total integrated luminosity of 111  pb@xmath4 , utilizing the forward muon toroids and the end plug electromagnetic calorimeter to extend the coverage in rapidity . also shown",
    "are the predictions of the dyrad nlo monte carlo  @xcite using various parton distribution functions .",
    "the uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath19 due to the choice of pdf in the modeling of  events is constrained by selecting only pdf s which show good agreement with the asymmetry data ,  those for which @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the weighted mean of the asymmetries @xmath36 .",
    "the resulting uncertainty on @xmath19 is @xmath44 in the cdf analysis ( see table  [ table : mw_sys ] ) .",
    "recent analyses of data based on the production of  bosons at the fermilab tevatron have resulted in precision measurement of the properies of the .",
    "the indirect measurement of the  boson width is @xmath45  ( world average , excluding the preliminary run 1b results ) , corresponding to a precision of 3% .",
    "the new world average value of the  mass is @xmath18 , corresponding to a precision of 0.15% .",
    "new studies of the trilinear gauge boson couplings have also been undertaken .",
    "the production of  and  events is in agreement with the prediction of the sm , within the experimental sensitivity .",
    "the current 95% cl limits on the trilinear coupling parameters are ( approximately ) @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the  coupling assuming @xmath48 (  coupling assuming @xmath49 ) .",
    "the measurements provide direct evidence for the existence of the @xmath50 coupling and show that the photon couples to the su(2 ) weak isospin of the  boson as well as to its u(1 ) electric charge .    the upgraded 0  and",
    "cdf detectors will begin running at the tevatron in 1999 .",
    "improvements in the precision in the measurement of the properties of the  boson , coupled with improved measurements of the top quark mass , will yield predictions for the higgs mass and may provide crucial self consistency tests of the sm ."
