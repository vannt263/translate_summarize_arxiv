    "the current acceleration of the cosmic expansion is one of the most puzzling aspects of modern cosmology . aside from a cosmological constant",
    "whose smallness remains unexplained , the simplest models typically involve an additional scalar field either implicitly or explicitly .",
    "universal coupling of this field to matter would produce gravitational strength fifth forces and naively be excluded by laboratory and solar system bounds .",
    "viable models must therefore implement a so - called screening mechanism to hide fifth forces locally .",
    "screening mechanisms invoke nonlinearity in the field equations to change the nature of the fifth force in high density regions .",
    "for example , the chameleon mechanism increases the mass of the field in deep gravitational potentials @xcite whereas the symmetron mechanism changes its coupling to matter @xcite .",
    "a third possibility is the vainshtein mechanism @xcite , first introduced in the context of massive gravity to suppress the propagation of additional helicity modes @xcite . here",
    "nonlinear derivative interactions of the field act to screen the fifth force within the so - called vainshtein radius around a matter source .",
    "the vainshtein mechanism occurs not only in modern incarnations of boulware - deser @xcite ghost - free massive gravity @xcite but also in galileon cosmology @xcite and braneworld models .",
    "indeed it is in the braneworld model of dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) @xcite that it has been best studied @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these mechanisms are distinguished by how screened bodies fall in external fields @xcite . as a consequence of universal coupling , all unscreened test bodies fall in the same way and obey a microscopic equivalence principle . in the chameleon and symmetron models ,",
    "screened bodies do not respond to external fields . in the vainshtein mechanism",
    "they do , but only if those fields have wavelengths long compared to the vainshtein radius .",
    "these differences arise because the self - field of the screened body and the external field do not in general superimpose but rather interfere in a manner dependent on the nonlinear interaction @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the vainshtein mechanism in the near - field limit .",
    "in particular we study the motion of two bodies that are separated by much less than their individual vainshtein radii and look for apparent violations of the equivalence principle .",
    "the two - body problem is particularly relevant since it has been shown that for the orbit of test bodies , there is a universal anomalous precession rate induced by a vainshtein - screened scalar field that is potentially measurable in next generation solar system tests of general relativity @xcite .",
    "however in the earth - moon system the moon is screened on scales out to nearly a parsec for cosmologically motivated models and can not be considered as a test body in the earth s field . in principle",

    ". then the only effect of screening is to reduce the large body s force by the factor of @xmath208 and we have a proportional change in the precession , @xmath209 precession thus depends on the mass ratio of the bodies and is not universal .",
    "different mass bodies will precess at different rates leading to an apparent equivalence principle violation . on the other hand ,",
