    "[ remark ] the proof provides bounds for the number of bridges from @xmath18 to the right side of the strip of width @xmath74 , namely , @xmath148 in paragraphs 3.3.3 and 3.4.3 of @xcite , precise behaviors are conjectured for the number of self - avoiding walks between two points on the boundary of a domain , which yields the following ( conjectured ) estimate : @xmath149 where @xmath15 is the boundary derivative of the poisson kernel . integrating with respect to @xmath150 , we obtain that @xmath151 should decay as @xmath152 when @xmath74 goes to infinity .",
    "similar estimates are conjectured for walks in @xmath73 from @xmath97 to @xmath153 .",
    "in @xcite , nienhuis proposed a more precise asymptotical behavior for the number of self - avoiding walks : @xmath154 with @xmath155 . here",
    "the symbol @xmath156 means that the ratio of two sides is of the order @xmath157 , or perhaps even tends to a constant .",
    "moreover , nienhuis gave arguments in support of flory s prediction that the mean - square displacement @xmath158 satisfies @xmath159 with @xmath160 . despite the precision of the predictions and , the best rigorously known bounds are very far apart and almost 50 years old ( see @xcite for an exposition ) .",
    "the derivation of these exponents seems to be one of the most challenging problems in probability .",
    "it was shown by g.  lawler , o.  schramm and w.  werner in @xcite that @xmath117 and @xmath161 could be computed if the self - avoiding walk would posses a conformally invariant scaling limit .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath162 be a simply connected domain in the complex plane @xmath163 with two points @xmath18 and @xmath37 on the boundary . for @xmath164 , we consider the discrete approximation given by the largest finite domain @xmath165 of @xmath166 included in @xmath35 , and @xmath167 and @xmath168 to be the vertices of @xmath165 closest to @xmath18 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "a probability measure @xmath169 is defined on the set of self - avoiding trajectories @xmath117 between @xmath167 and @xmath168 that remain in @xmath165 by assigning to @xmath117 a weight proportional to @xmath170 .",
    "we obtain a random curve denoted @xmath171 .",
    "conjectured conformal invariance of self - avoiding walks can be stated as follows , see @xcite :    [ sle ] let @xmath35 be a simply connected domain ( not equal to @xmath163 ) with two distinct points @xmath18 , @xmath37 on its boundary . for @xmath42 ,",
    "the law of @xmath171 in @xmath172 converges when @xmath173 to the ( chordal ) schramm - loewner evolution with parameter @xmath174 in @xmath35 from @xmath18 to @xmath37 .",
    "thus it would suffice to show that a normalized version of @xmath175 has a conformally invariant scaling limit , which can be achieved by showing that it is holomorphic and has prescribed boundary values .    as discussed in @xcite , the winding of an interface leading to a boundary edge @xmath34",
    "is uniquely determined , and coincides with the winding of the boundary itself .",
    "thus one can say that @xmath175 satisfies a discrete version of the following _ riemann boundary value problem _ ( a homogeneous version of the riemann - hilbert - privalov bvp ) : @xmath176 with a singularity at @xmath18 .",
    "note that the problem above has conformally covariant solutions ( as @xmath177-forms ) , and so is well defined even in domains with fractal boundaries .",
    "as noted in remark  [ rem : cr ] , relation amounts to saying that discrete contour integrals of @xmath175 vanish .",
    "so any ( subsequential ) scaling limit of @xmath175 would have to be holomorphic .",
    "unfortunately , relation alone , is unsufficient to deduce the existence of such a limit , unlike in the ising case @xcite .",
    "the reason is that for a domain with @xmath178 edges , imposes @xmath179 relations ( one per vertice ) for @xmath178 values of @xmath175 , making it impossible to reconstruct @xmath175 from its boundary values .",
    "so @xmath175 is not exactly holomorphic , it can be rather thought of as a divergence - free vector field , which seems to have non - trivial curl .",
    "however , we expect that in the limit the curl vanishes , which is equivalent to @xmath180 having the same limit regardless of the orientation of the edge @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 be a simply connected domain ( not equal to @xmath163 ) , let @xmath40 , and let @xmath18 , @xmath37 be two distinct points on the boundary of @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that the boundary of @xmath35 is smooth near @xmath37 . for @xmath164 , let @xmath175 be the holomorphic observable in the domain @xmath181 approximating @xmath182 , and let @xmath183 be the closest point in @xmath165 to @xmath34 .",
    "then        the right - hand side of is well - defined , since the conformal map @xmath187 is unique up to multiplication by a real factor .",
