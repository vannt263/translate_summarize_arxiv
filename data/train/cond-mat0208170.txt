    "<S> the interrelation between the condensation energy and the optical sum rules has been investigated . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that  the so called partial sum rule violation is related mainly to a temperature dependence of the relaxation rate rather than to the appearance of superconductivity itself . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we demonstrate that the experimental data on the temperature dependence of the optical sum rule can be explained rather well by an account of strong electron - phonon interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> many recently published works are concerned with the origin of the condensation energy of the superconducting state , a possible violation of so - called optical sum rules , and the relation between these phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> these papers include both theoretical investigationshm , nor1,scal , legg , nor2,kim of these problems and experimental attemptsbasov , vdm , holcomb , santan to observe a violation of the optical sum rule . </S>",
    "<S> usually , the possibility of such violation is related to the change of the kinetic energy of metals under superconducting transition . if this statement would be correct , than the violation of the optical sum rule should be most clear seen in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer@xcite@xmath0 type superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proved  exactly by bogolyubov@xcite that the original model does not contain any potential energy . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see considering the original @xmath1 hamiltonian @xmath2n . </S>",
    "<S> bogolyubov has proven that for the normal state @xmath3where @xmath4 is the system volume . </S>",
    "<S> it means that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath5the @xmath1 hamiltonian can be exactly diagonalized in the superconducting state using the bogolyubov - valatin transformation @xmath6it leads to @xmath7where @xmath8which is a hamiltonian of noninteracting but superconducting quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> the condensation energy arises from the decreasing of the ground state eigenvalue of the expression @xmath9 due to an appearance of a gap @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for any mechanisms of superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease of a properly defined one - quasiparticle energy due to the appearance of the gap on a fermi level is the main contribution to the condensation energy . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon has a certain feature is common to a metal - insulator transition , where the band structure contribution to the total energy decreases also due to the appearance of the gap on the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> the example of the bcs model shows that the division of the total energy into kinetic and potential parts is not a trivial problem even for weakly interacting quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> this division becomes even worse defined in systems with strongly interacting electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the study of the optical sum rule and its change below the superconducting transition should be based , from our point of view , on calculations of the conductivity itself and a detailed analysis of this function and its dependence on temperature and frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> the optical sum rule can be written in general form as @xmath11where @xmath12 is the real part of the dynamical conductivity , @xmath13  is the total electron density and @xmath14  is the bare electron mass . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath12 has a zero frequency @xmath15 function peak in the superconducting state due to the dissipationless ( rigid ) response of the superconducting condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of this peak @xmath16 can be expressed in terms of an corresponding penetration depth @xmath17   @xmath18where @xmath19  is the velocity of light . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of this @xmath15 function contribution to @xmath12  in the superconducting state leads to the so - called ferrel - glover - tinkham sum rule@xcite @xmath20 = \\frac{c^{2}}{8\\lambda _ { l}^{2}% } \\ ,   \\label{3}\\]]where @xmath21  is the conductivity in the normal and superconducting states , correspondingly . in such general form </S>",
    "<S> this sum rule can never be violated for any superconductors possessing ideal diamagnetic response with a finite penetration depth @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the real measurement of the dynamical conductivity can never be made up to infinite frequency . </S>",
    "<S> they are restricted in practice to some finite value @xmath22 . as it is well known@xcite , the sum rule ( 9 ) is totally satisfied in conventional superconductors when the integration is performed up to @xmath23 where @xmath10  is the superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> this value of @xmath24 is of the order of the characteristic phonon energies . </S>",
    "<S> the statements about the sum rules violation , which has been made in the experimental papersbasov , vdm , holcomb , santan , mean that the value @xmath24 in high-@xmath25 superconductors is much larger than in conventional ones . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value @xmath22  in high-@xmath25 systems , if they were also conventional , should be @xmath26 because they have a magnitude of the gap @xmath27 it has been shown in@xcite that for the interlayer conductivity the optical sum rules are not saturated at least in underdoped regime for @xmath28 even more intriguing results have been obtained recently in the paper@xcite where the violation sum rules have been observed up to very high energies @xmath29 the main goal of the present paper is to show that the observed violation of the optical sum rules at least for @xmath30 is not related explicitly to any mechanism of superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> this violation is the direct consequence of a high value of the electron relaxation rate @xmath31 , critical temperature @xmath32 and @xmath10 themselves .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the for the future discussion important the so - called restricted or partial optical sum rule . </S>",
    "<S> usually it is used in the form @xmath33here @xmath34is the an effective inverse electron band mass , which is defined as @xmath35where @xmath36 is an electron distribution function . for a hamiltonian with nearest neighbor hopping @xmath37  </S>",
    "<S> can be presented in terms of a average of the one band kinetic energy @xcite @xmath38@xmath39here @xmath40  is the lattice spacing in @xmath41  - direction and @xmath42 is the nearest neighbor hopping integral . </S>",
    "<S> usually it is believed that the high energy cut off  frequency @xmath24  should be chosen of the order of the corresponding band plasma frequency @xmath43 and is much smaller than the energies of interband transitions . </S>",
    "<S> this partial sum rule can be easily proved for noninteracting band electrons including the _ interband _ transitions in the expression for the conductivity @xmath44here the summation is over all empty high energy bands with an electron dispersion @xmath45 the minimum of the value @xmath46  is the energy of the interband transitions . </S>",
    "<S> now , using @xmath47  we can easily prove the sum rules @xmath48 and @xmath49  which give the well known identity for the electron inverse effective mass@xcite @xmath50however is it not the case for interacting electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this fact can be easily understood using the model of electrons interacting with impurities . </S>",
    "<S> the _ intraband _ contribution to the optical conductivity can be written in this case in form of the usual drude expression for @xmath51    @xmath52    where @xmath53  is the relaxation rate due to impurity scattering . </S>",
    "<S> one can derive the well known result for the partial optical sum rule    @xmath54    this example shows that the _ intraband _ sum rules @xmath48and @xmath49 can be satisfied in the presence of the interaction only in the limit @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also true for any interactions other than impurity scattering including , for example , the electron - phonon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this violation of the optical sum rules can not be obtained from the calculation of the kinetic energy change from @xmath56 as it was made in the refs.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as it follows from @xmath57  the optical sum rules violation depends on the high energy cutoff @xmath24  but this parameter is certainly absent in the expression for the kinetic energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the _ interband _ transitions will also be changed due to electron interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we can rewrite @xmath58 for the impurity scattering model in the simplest approximation as    @xmath59    the general sum rule @xmath60 is certainly satisfied in this model for any value of the relaxation rate @xmath61 but it is not true for the partial sum rule as we have discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> further , as it follows from @xmath62 the _ interband  _ contribution to the conductivity becomes now spread out over all intervals of energies including very low @xmath63 it means that we can not even divide experimental data into _ intraband _ contributions and _ interband _ ones . </S>",
    "<S> all these effects are small as @xmath64 and @xmath65 however , if we shall take into account that the relaxation rate in high-@xmath25 compounds can reach values @xmath66 we see immediately that these effects can be very important even in the normal state .    as the discussion given above confirms </S>",
    "<S> , there is no other way to understand the behavior of the partial sum rules than to calculate the conductivity itself as a function of frequency , temperature , doping etc . </S>",
    "<S> it can be obtained by a calculation of a current - current correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to emphasize here that expression for the current - current correlation function does not contain , at least in the absence of the vertex corrections , any explicit information about the mechanism of superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> all implicit information about the mechanism is contained in the one - particle green s function which can be written as @xmath67here @xmath68 is a renormalization function , @xmath69 is the superconducting order parameter , and @xmath70 are pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> these functions should be calculated in turn from the general equations for the green s function of electrons . </S>",
    "<S> such equations have been derived by eliashberg@xcite for conventional superconductors with the electron - phonon pairing mechanism and , for example , in refs.@xcite for @xmath71wave superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for @xmath72 can be written for @xmath73 in the form @xmath74the expression on the right hand side of the @xmath75 is nothing else than the bcs type coherency factors . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath75 have been derived@xcite for the conventional superconductors and was used recently@xcite to discuss the problem of the influence of the superconducting gap on the optical spectra at @xmath76 . in spite of </S>",
    "<S> that this expression has been derived in the framework of the usual @xmath77wave superconductivity , it has with a slight modification much wider areas of applications . </S>",
    "<S> one can , for example , include the angular dependence of the gap for anisotropic superconductors and perform the integration over the angle . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to show using @xmath78 that for @xmath79 we have    @xmath80    here the numerical coefficient @xmath81 is of the order of unity and it is included to take into account the possible averaging of the angular dependence of the gap function . </S>",
    "<S> the same estimation for the dynamical conductivity of a superconducting state at @xmath82 can be obtained from the equations derived in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath83 shows that the direct contribution of the superconducting gap to the dynamical conductivity and , therefore , to the optical sum rules has the same smallness for any mechanism of superconductivity , that is @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> this smallness is , certainly , different for conventional superconductors and high-@xmath25 ones because the gap in the later is one order larger .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath85 for the _ interband _ contribution can also be generalized for the superconducting case and it can be shown that their difference from the normal state is of the order of @xmath86 we shall not consider the behavior of the optical sum rules in the superconducting state further in this paper because the real mechanism of superconductivity in high-@xmath25 systems is unknown . the investigation of the optical sum rules for the normal state will be of our main interest in the rest part of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed experimental study of this problem has been done by d. van der marel and coworkers@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they have measured the conductivity in a wide frequency range and temperature intervals and than two optical sum rules have been calculated . </S>",
    "<S> one of them was the low energy sum rule @xmath87    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the penetration depth in the @xmath90 plane and the other one is the high energy sum rule @xmath91    @xmath92    a few very prominent features in the behavior of both @xmath87 and @xmath91have been found in this work . </S>",
    "<S> first , @xmath87 and @xmath91 are temperature dependent in the superconducting state as well as in the normal one . </S>",
    "<S> second , this dependence , at least , in the normal state is well described by a quadratic function of @xmath93 in addition , the low energy part depends on the high - energy cutoff frequency @xmath94 if we consider the cases @xmath95 and @xmath96    we are coming now to the consideration of details in the high energy part of the optical sum rule @xmath97 preliminary we shall neglect the direct contributions of  the superconducting gap to the value of @xmath91 because the ratio @xmath98 for the considered values of frequencies is very small @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the main problem in the calculation of the normal state conductivity is to establish the origin of the electron relaxation in high-@xmath25 systems . </S>",
    "<S> this problem along with the problem of the origin of superconductivity itself has been disputed during the last 15 years . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown ( see for details@xcite ) that the main source of the relaxation processes in the normal state of high-@xmath25 superconductors is the strong electron - phonon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been additionally demonstrated through examination of the frequency and temperature dependence of the optical reflectivity in the @xmath100 systemmaksssc that this interaction leads to a strong temperature dependence of the conductivity up to very high frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental verification of the existence of strong electron - phonon interaction in high-@xmath25 superconductors has been also obtained in arpes measurements@xcite as an effect of an electron mass renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> there is some discussion@xcite about the possibility , that the electron mass renormalization observed in ref.@xciteand the corresponding change of the relaxation rate can been explained by the interaction with the so - called magnetic resonance peak. this possibility , however , is unlikely@xcite , at least , for the normal state . as is well known , in the normal state the conductivity @xmath101 in a presence of the strong electron - phonon interaction can be written in the form@xcite    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the frequency dependent optical mass and @xmath31 is the optical relaxation rate . </S>",
    "<S> the readers can find the precise expressions for both these functions in terms of the eliashberg function in refs.@xcite and we shall not reproduce them here . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath104 for high values of frequencies @xmath105 can be rewritten for the real part of the conductivity in the form    @xmath106    where @xmath107 is independent on frequency@xcite    @xmath108    here @xmath109 is the transport eliashberg function . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to show by using @xmath110 , that @xmath111where    @xmath112    is the _ transport _ constant of epi , and @xmath113 is the average phonon frequency . at considerably high temperatures , on the other hand , @xmath107 can be written as    @xmath114    @xmath115 and @xmath116 show that the relaxation rate can increase considerably with increasing of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it will lead , to some increase of the high frequency part of the optical sum rule , which can be written in the form    @xmath117    where @xmath118 . using @xmath119 and @xmath120 </S>",
    "<S> we can easily calculate this value . </S>",
    "<S> there are two independent fitting parameters in this procedure : the plasma frequency @xmath121 and the coupling constant @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen the value @xmath123 in accordance with apres data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the _ intraband _ plasma frequency is also unknown , but it is bounded from above by the value of the low part of the sum rule obtained in ref.@xcite , that is    @xmath124    for the numerical calculations we have employed the eliashberg function from our preceding papers@xcite and use the general expression for the conductivity @xmath125 rather than approximate @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> we carried out our calculations for two slightly different eliashberg functions shown in the inset in fig.1 , having the same value of @xmath127 the difference between these spectra is related to the different coupling of electrons with a soft phonon @xmath128 and harder ones . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of @xmath91 is shown in fig.1 at @xmath129 we have used as in ref.@xcite the @xmath130 scale for the temperature to demonstrate the near perfect quadratic dependence @xmath91 on @xmath93 the overall agreement of our results with the experimental data is reasonably well . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true concerning the experimentally observed difference @xmath131it can also be seen from fig.1 , that @xmath91 has a temperature dependence also at @xmath132 where @xmath25 is the critical temperature of the superconducting transition ( @xmath133 for the considered case ) . *  </S>",
    "<S> * we would also like to emphasize that there is a little different behavior of these curves at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath91 decreases with decreasing of temperature for a softer spectrum even faster for low temperature than @xmath134 as it has for high @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , @xmath91 has a more weaker temperature dependence at low @xmath135 for more harder spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the difference @xmath136 for the spectrum with soft low frequency phonons is larger then for the harder one . *  </S>",
    "<S> * we did not take into account in our calculations the influence of the superconductivity on @xmath97 it is small from our point of view but it can exist . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from the above consideration that it is very difficult to separate using experimental data this specific superconducting contribution from the total change of @xmath91 connected with the change of the relaxation rate . *  </S>",
    "<S> *    the general behavior of the low energy sum rule @xmath137 ( not shown in fig.1 ) is also reproduced rather well in our approach , at least for the normal state . </S>",
    "<S> there is only one contradiction related to the total amplitude of the change of the value @xmath138 it is clear from the above consideration that the following equality should be satisfied in the normal state    @xmath139    where    @xmath140    it is easy to see that    @xmath141    it means that the total change of the low energy sum rule @xmath142 should be twice larger than the change of @xmath143 . measurements@xcite </S>",
    "<S> give rather the value @xmath144 instead of two . </S>",
    "<S> we do not know the exact origin of this contradiction . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that it is related to the temperature dependence of the _ interband _ transitions which have not been included into our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we have obtained as the value of the intraband contribution to @xmath145 at @xmath146 . </S>",
    "<S> it is much smaller than the experimentally measured @xmath91  @xmath147 the difference between these two values comes from the _ interband _ transitions . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to say anything definite at this time about the temperature dependence of the _ interband _ transitions and we will continue our activity in this direction . </S>",
    "<S> now we would like to emphasize that it not easy to find any other mechanism of the relaxation besides the electron - phonon one which can lead to a temperature dependence of the relaxation rate at so high frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> many of them , including , for example , the marginal fermi liquid@xcite , do not give any temperature dependence at @xmath148    we can not calculate and compare with the experiment the sum rules in the underdoped regime due to the existence of a _ pseudogap _ phenomenon because its origin is also unknown . </S>",
    "<S> we can , however , claim that it is very likely that the discussed effect will be also exist in the underdoped case . </S>",
    "<S> this statement is based on observations obtained both by optical measurements @xcite and as well as arpes@xcite , that the relaxation rate increases with decreasing the doping level . </S>",
    "<S> this also is confirmed by result obtained in ref.@xcite on the sum rules violation .    in summary , we have shown that there are no new energy scales defining the influence of the superconductivity on the intraband contribution to the optical sum rules , besides the superconducting energy gap itself . </S>",
    "<S> this is true for any mechanism of the superconductivity because the expression for @xmath149 at high frequencies does not include any explicit information about such mechanisms .  the experimentally observed violation of the sum rule is mainly related to the properties of the normal state of high-@xmath25 superconductors and it is ruled mainly by the frequency and temperature dependence of the relaxation rate . we also have shown that the experimental data obtained in the ref.@xcite can be explained very reasonably in the framework of the usual model with strong electron - phonon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the consideration of the sum rules for the interplanar conductivity where the coherent transport is absent in the normal state requires a more serious approach and the knowledge of the mechanism blocking this transport . </S>",
    "<S> we should also know more details about the pseudogap phenomenon and its interplay with superconductivity in order to make more conclusive statements about the sum rule behavior in the underdoped regime .    </S>",
