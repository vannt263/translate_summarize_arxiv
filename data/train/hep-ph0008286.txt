    "an increasing amount of work has been dedicated to the physics possibilities of @xmath2 colliders @xcite , @xcite .",
    "such colliders offer novel ways of producing higgs bosons , and much attention has been given to the study of neutral higgs bosons produced as resonances in the s - channel @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of @xmath0 at @xmath2 colliders has previously been considered to be more or less identical to that at @xmath6 colliders .",
    "this is because the pair production processes of @xmath12 have been assumed to have the same rate at both colliders .",
    "this is the case in the mssm , where the higgs mediated s - channel diagrams have been shown to be negligible at a @xmath2 collider @xcite .",
    "the single production of @xmath0 via the process @xmath13 @xcite , which proceeds dominantly via loops , has relatively small rates .",
    "an analysis in the context of the lhc has been covered in @xcite . at a muon collider",
    "this process can have a much larger cross - section because the tree - level diagrams , which are suppressed by @xmath14 in the @xmath6 case , are proportional to @xmath15 , and become by far the dominant contribution .",
    "the mechanism @xmath16 was first considered in @xcite and subsequently developed in @xcite .",
    "it possesses several advantages over the conventional pair production process , @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , @xmath18 may be produced on - shell for @xmath19 , which compares favourably with the kinematic reach for pair production ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "in addition , backgrounds are expected to be relatively small , since for @xmath21 decays the main background would be from @xmath22 production which has a cross - section of 700 fb at @xmath23 gev . in @xcite an analysis in the context of the mssm showed that sizeable cross - sections ( @xmath24 fb ) can be attained for @xmath25 . in this paper",
    "we consider the general ( non - susy ) two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , which has the added advantage of allowing cp - violation in the tree - level higgs potential .",
    "in contrast to the mssm , all the higgs masses may be taken free parameters and so one would expect larger cross - sections , as well as cp asymmetries in the rates for @xmath3 .",
    "we will show that such a production mechanism may provide a copious source of @xmath0 as well as offering a novel way of probing cp violation in the higgs sector , the latter not being possible in the standard mechanism @xmath17 .",

    "one finds two cp even neutral scalar eigenstates , @xmath33 , and a cp odd eigenstate @xmath34 . in the cp violating case , mixing is induced between the cp even and cp odd neutral scalar fields , resulting in three mass eigenstates @xmath35 with no definite cp quantum numbers . in the mssm , such mixing may be induced when one considers the 1-loop effective scalar potential .",
    "this would also lead to a rate asymmetry in the processes @xmath3 and this will be addressed in @xcite .",
