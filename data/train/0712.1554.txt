    "familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( fhc ) is a genetic disease causing significant impairment of cardiac functionality and premature death in children and young adults @xcite . a number of mutations in genes encoding cardiac sarcomeric proteins including the @xmath0-myosin heavy chain , the cardiac troponin t , titin , and cardiac myosin binding protein c ( mybp - c ) have been found to correlate with such disease  @xcite .",
    "the fhc patients with mybp - c mutations represent 20 - 45 % of the total  @xcite , so that mutations on this protein are the second most common cause of the disease .",
    "while nonsense mutations on mybp - c gene determine a premature termination of translation of the c - terminus and result in a mild phenotype  @xcite , a number of missense mutations lead to a severe phenotype and the precise mechanism through which they cause the disease is still unknown  @xcite .",
    "mybp - c is a linear sequence of 11 igi - like and fibronectin - like domains referred to as c0-c10 working as a potential regulator of cardiac contractility @xcite . according to moolman - smook model @xcite",
    ", three mybp - c molecules form a ring around the thick filaments ( figure  [ ms - model ] ) .",
    "the collar is stabilized by specific interactions between domains c5-c8 of a molecule and domains c7-c10 of the neighboring one .",
    "the amino - terminal region between domains c0 and c4 protrudes out of the thick filament and , upon phosphorylation , interacts with subfragment 2 of myosin ( s2 ) acting as a brake for muscular contraction  @xcite .",
    "mutations on mybp - c might either prevent the c0-c4 region from interacting with the s2 fragment ( hyper - contractility ) or force a carboxy - truncated mutant to permanently interact with s2 ( hypo - contractility )  @xcite .",
    "our work will be concerned with the folding behavior of domain c5 whose structure was resolved through nmr by idowu et al .",
    "this domain belongs to the igi set of the immunoglobulin superfamily and it features a typical @xmath0-sandwich structure with two twisted @xmath0-sheets closely packed against each other .",
    "the first @xmath0-sheet ( @xmath01 ) is formed by strands c , f , g and a , while the second @xmath0-sheet comprises strands b , d and e ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : struct ] ) .",
    "a remarkable peculiarity of the c5 domain of the cardiac mybp - c isoform is the presence of two long insertions not present in the fast and slow skeletal isoforms .",
    "the first insertion is 10-residue long and is located in the linker between the c4 and c5 domains ; the second insertion is 28 residues in length and resides in the cd loop  @xcite .",
    "a recent experimental work @xcite proved that the n - terminal region containing the first insertion is not just a linker between c4 and c5 , but it plays an important role in the thermodynamical stability of the domain .",
    "conversely , the long and highly mobile prolin - reach cd - loop destabilizes the protein lowering the folding temperature as compared to other ig - domains@xcite .",
    "this loop is suspected to form an sh3 domain recognition sequence presumably binding to the cam - ii like kinase that co - purifies with mybp - c  @xcite .",
    "three fhc causing mutations have been identified on c5 domain : asn755lys , arg654his and arg668his .",
    "the first one lies on the fg - loop and leads to a significant destabilization of the protein yielding a severe phenotype  @xcite .",
    "the arg654his and arg668his mutations , related to a much milder phenotype , are reported not to impair the thermodynamic stability of the protein .",
    "residue arg654 is actually suspected to regulate the specificity of the binding of positively charged substrates , as it is located in the negatively charged cfga face that is a potential target for the binding with domain c8  @xcite .",
    "a role in ligand binding is also postulated for arg668  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to investigate through md simulations the role of the above mentioned three known fhc causing mutations .",
    "clarke and coworkers showed that for the proteins belonging to the ig - superfamily both transition and native states are stabilized by the same contacts dictated by protein topology  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the ig - superfamily members share similar folding pathways mainly determined by their common geometry .",
    "therefore the native - centric approach seems to be the natural framework to investigate the folding properties of ig - like c5 domain . to incorporate topology and some specific chemical feature as well as the effect of the side chain packing we resorted to consider a heavy - map g model where native contacts are identified on the basis of the steric hindrance of side - chains .",
    "moreover we also introduced some amount of heterogeneity in the energetic couplings of the g force field .",
    "this approach is particularly suitable for the c5 domain because we need to address the problem of discriminating the effects of mutations such as arg654his and arg668his modeled through the removal of the same number of native contacts .",
    "the importance of introducing energetic heterogeneity in a g - model for a reliable mutation analysis , is showed for example , by the work of clementi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where all the available experimental data on free energy differences upon single mutations of s6 ribosomal protein and its circular permutants , were reproduced with correlation coefficients larger than @xmath2 .",
    "when the folding process is mainly driven by the topological constraints of the native state , it is convenient to use simplified coarse - grained models describing the protein molecule as a chain of beads centered on the c@xmath3 carbon positions  @xcite .",
    "the g force field introduces a bias towards native structure rewarding native - like interactions , through lennard - jones attractive forces and appropriate angular potentials embodying secondary structure motifs .",
    "the approach assigns to the native state the lowest energy and minimizes frustration yielding a perfect funnel landscape .",
    "we consider a light variant of the g - like force field proposed by clementi _",
    "et al . _ and used in several other papers  @xcite .",
    "the model is defined by the potential energy  @xcite : @xmath4 +   k_{\\phi}^{(3)}[1 - \\cos3(\\phi_{i } - \\phi_{i}^{0 } ) ]   \\nonumber \\\\ \\sum_{i , j > i+3 } v_{nb}(r_{ij})\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last potential corresponding to non bonded interaction is such that @xmath5    &   \\mbox{$i - j$ native } \\\\   5 \\epsilon_r \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r_{ij } } \\right)^{12 } &   \\mbox{$i - j$ not native } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] in the above formulas , @xmath6 is the distance between residue @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the bending angle identified by the three consecutive c@xmath3 s @xmath10 , @xmath7 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the dihedral angle defined by the two planes formed by four consecutive c@xmath3 s @xmath13 , @xmath10 , @xmath7 , @xmath11 .",
    "the symbols with the superscript @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the corresponding quantities in the native conformation .",
    "the force field parameters are proportional to the energy scale @xmath16 kcal / mol such that @xmath17 ( @xmath18  ) , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters of the repulsive lennard - jones terms between non native contacts are chosen as follows : @xmath22   , @xmath23 .",
    "two residues @xmath7 and @xmath8 are considered to interact attractively whenever their side - chains have at least a pair of heavy atoms closer than a distance cutoff @xmath24  .",
    "accordingly , the attractive native interactions depend on the coefficients @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number of atomic contacts between residues @xmath7 and @xmath8 in their native position and @xmath27 is the maximum value of @xmath26 in the set of native contacts corresponding to the couple lys45-tyr109 .",
    "we performed controlled temperature md simulations employing the isokinetic thermostat  @xcite with time step @xmath28 , where the time unit @xmath29 ps ( @xmath30 is the average mass of an aminoacid residue estimated to @xmath31 da ) .",
    "as a remark we observe that several strategies can be employed to introduce heterogeneity .",
    "a very common choice is to use the set of parameters derived by miyazawa and jernigan @xcite .",
    "other authors  @xcite instead prefer to tune the energy parameters through a design procedure based on energy gap maximization .",
    "our strategy of rescaling the contact energies according to the number of atomic contacts is grounded on experimental and theoretical evidence . in particular , the mutation analysis on barnase by serrano _",
    "@xcite showed a non trivial correlation between the destabilization induced by the mutation and the number of methyl or methylene side groups surrounding the deleted group .",
    "moreover , kurochkina and lee  @xcite , found that the pairwise sum of the buried surface area is linearly related to the true buried area , as computed with the algorithm of lee and richards @xcite and to the contact potential of miyazawa and jernigan  @xcite .",
    "the approach proposed by kurochkina was then followed by sung  @xcite for an efficient modeling of the hydrophobic effect in a monte carlo study of @xmath0-hairpin folding .",
    "a significant correlation between the average contribution of individual residues to folding stability and the buried asa was also noticed by zhou and zhou  @xcite . to check that heterogeneity",
    "we have introduces does not lead to excessive frustration in the energy landscape , we performed rapid quenching simulations to collect a data set @xmath32 of decoys .",
    "we then estimate the ratio @xmath33 between the glassy and folding temperature of our protein as the ratio : energetic standard deviation of the decoy set over the energy gap .",
    "we found that this quantity which is a measure of the energy landscape frustration remained substantially unaltered from the heterogeneous g - model , @xmath34 , to the homogeneous one @xmath35 .",
    "a customary indicator of the native - likeness of residues in the transition state ( ts ) is represented by the @xmath1-values : a value @xmath36 , characterizes residues establishing native - like interactions already in the ts , whereas a value close to zero is typical of residues involved into a disordered conformation in the ts .",
    "we apply the free energy perturbation technique ( fep ) @xcite to evaluate the @xmath1-values from our md simulations @xmath37 where the boltzmann factors depend on the energy difference between the mutant and the wild type ( wt ) and the averages are computed over wt - conformations of the folded ( f ) , transition state ( ts ) and unfolded ( u ) ensembles . in the present paper ,",
    "the @xmath1-values are computed according to equation  [ fep_phi ] using a method developed by clementi _",
    "_ @xcite that can be summarized in the following steps .",
    "i ) determination of the folding temperature @xmath38 from the specific heat plot .",
    "ii ) analysis of the free energy profile at temperature @xmath38 plotted as a function of a suitable folding reaction coordinate .",
    "the double - well free energy profile of a two - state folder allows to define three windows of the reaction coordinate identifying the folded , transition state and unfolded ensembles respectively .",
    "iii ) dynamic simulation at @xmath39 and storage of conformations belonging to the f , ts and u ensembles .",
    "vi ) choice of mutations and computation of fep @xmath1-values ( [ fep_phi ] ) .",
    "structural information about the native - likeness of the transition state was also gained from the so - called structural @xmath1-values : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the frequencies of the native contact @xmath43 in the folded and transition ensembles respectively , and the sum runs over the set @xmath44 of native contacts in which residue @xmath7 is involved .",
    "an interesting property of the transition state is the existence of a few _ key residues _ acting as nucleation centers for the folding process . following an approach proposed by vendruscolo _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the importance of these residues can be better understood by portraying the protein as a weighted graph .",
    "residues represent the vertices and the weighted edges are defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents the fraction of ts ensemble structures where residues @xmath7 and @xmath8 are in contact . by using the dijkstra s",
    "algorithm  @xcite we computed the minimal path @xmath47 _ i.e. _ the minimum of the sum of the weights @xmath48 of the edges traversed along each route between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the fraction of minimal paths passing through residue @xmath49 defines the _ betweenness _ @xmath50 of that residue .",
    "this quantity therefore measures the centrality of a residue : residues with a high betweenness act as `` hubs '' in the network and they presumably play a crucial role in the stabilization of the transition state .",
    "a thermal folding simulation of the wild - type ( wt ) c5-domain was performed by gradually cooling the protein from temperature @xmath51 to @xmath52 in 50 temperature steps .",
    "for each temperature , an equilibration stage of @xmath53 time steps was followed by a production stage of @xmath54 time steps .",
    "a similar schedule was employed to simulate the folding of the three missense mutants asn115lys , arg14his and arg28his ( notice that protein residues have been renumbered 1 - 130 as a restriction to the c5 domain only ) . within the framework of the g - model",
    ", we decided to implement a mutation of a residue by turning all its native contacts into non - native ones .",
    "the role of the amino - terminal region of the protein was also investigated through folding simulations of a deletion mutant , where the first 7 residues of the c5 domain were removed .",
    "the specific heat profiles , displayed in figure  [ fig : cvplot ] , show that the wt c5-domain and the missense mutants fold according to a cooperative , two - state mechanism as quantified by the vant hoff criterion  @xcite determined by parameter @xmath55 expressing the ratio between the vant hoff and the calorimetric enthalpies after appropriate baseline subtraction  @xcite in energy or @xmath56 plots .",
    "a value of @xmath57 close to unity indicates a very cooperative behavior of the folding transition .",
    "table  [ kappa2tab ] summarizes the @xmath57 values along with the experimental and theoretical transition temperatures .",
    ".experimental and simulated folding temperatures of wt domain c5 of mybp - c and its mutants .",
    "the last column reports the cooperativity parameters @xmath57 .",
    "n.a . = not available data . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the properties of the cd sequence were further studied by analyzing the average number of native contacts per amino - acid as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to this approach ,",
    "natively unfolded proteins are supposed to form a number of native interactions insufficient to compensate for the loss of conformational entropy , hence their necessity to couple folding with specific ligand binding . as a consequence , natively unfolded proteins are expected to feature an average number of contacts lower than that of globular proteins .",
    "natively unfolded and globular proteins can also be discriminated through a set of 20 artificial parameters designed through monte carlo maximization  @xcite of the scoring function @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the mean values of the adjustable parameters in two training dataset of folded and natively unfolded proteins and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the corresponding standard deviations .",
    "we generated the profiles of the average number of contacts per residue and of the artificial parameters by shifting a 5-residue window along the protein sequence and assigning the window average to the central residue , so that data in fig .",
    "[ fig : bioinf2 ] can be compared to the charge and hydrophobicity plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : bioinf ] , determined with the same procedure .",
    "the profiles of the average number of contacts and of the artificial parameters in figure  [ fig : bioinf2 ] , show that both indicators are effective in discriminating @xmath0-strands and unstructured loops , the latter being characterized by much lower values of the parameters .",
    "these results thus suggest that the cd loop of domain c5 of mybp - c should be classified as a _ natively unfolded sequence _ _ i.e. _ it is protein fragment that lacks a stable structure even in physiological conditions .",
    "a common feature of natively unfolded proteins is that their folding is usually associated with the binding to a specific ligand .",
    "it could thus be suggested that the long cd loop that appears structureless when the c5 domain is dissected from mybp - c , might actually be well folded _ in vivo _ due to a close interaction with a specific ligand .",
    "this hypothesis is further supported by the experimental finding that cardiac mybp - c co - purifies with the calmodulin class - ii ( cam - ii)-like kinase  @xcite so that the folding of the cd loop may be accompanied by docking with this enzyme .",
    "the involvement of mybp - c in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy motivated a study of the folding of domain c5 through equilibrium md simulations to gain insight into the role of the three fhc - related mutations : asn115lys , arg14his and arg28his .",
    "as a member of the immunoglobulin family , domain c5 lends itself to be reasonably modeled through a g - like force field  @xcite .",
    "we assessed the thermodynamics impact of a mutation through the entity of the shift in the folding temperature .",
    "our results show that , among the three fhc - related mutations we examined , asn115lys determines the largest decrease in @xmath38 , in agreement with the nmr spectra recorded by idowu  @xcite signalling absence of structure even at low temperature .",
    "conversely , the @xmath38 shift induced by the arg28his mutation is modest , while the protein destabilization induced by arg14his is negligible as its thermogram is almost perfectly superposable to that of the wt .",
    "this finding suggests that the latter two mutants have very little effect on protein stability and their pathological role must be sought elsewhere . both mutations arg14his and",
    "arg28his imply the removal of three contacts and their impact in the g - like approach could be partially resolved only through the introduction of heterogeneous energetic couplings suggesting the opportunity of a more refined analysis .",
    "further insights in the role of arg14 located in the n - terminus of the c5 domain , were attained through the study of the @xmath63 deletion mutant .",
    "the significant decrease in @xmath38 of the truncated domain indicates that the n - terminal region with its 10-residue long insert typical of the cardiac isoform , is not just a linker between the c4 and c5 domains , but it gives an important contribution to the stability .",
    "however , the low betweenness of the n - terminal residues indicates that they may be involved in contacts forming a subgraph only weakly connected to the core of the contact network .",
    "it is thus possible that the n - terminal contacts do appear only when the c5 domain is dissected from the rest of the protein and that the natural role of this section is more related to the binding with domain c8 complementing the negatively charged cfga surface  @xcite .",
    "this potential role of the fhc - related mutations is confirmed by the analysis of @xmath1-values that appear to be significantly higher in the cfga sheet where asn115 is located , than in the bde sheet that including arg268 .",
    "a final issue considered in the present work , is a analysis of the cd loop responsible for the low stability of the c5 domain as compared with other ig domains .",
    "the charge unbalance and the low hydrophobicity of the cd loop , accompanied by a low average number of native contacts and a low value of the artificial parameters introduced by galzitskaya  @xcite , is a clear indication that the c5 domain of mybp - c can be considered a _ natively unfolded _ protein _",
    "i.e. _ a protein that lacks a compact , globular structure under physiological conditions  @xcite",
    ". therefore the role of the cd loop of the c5 domain of the cardiac isoform of mybp - c , must be reconsidered within the framework of the peculiar properties of natively unfolded proteins . as the cardiac mybp - c co",
    "- purifies with the calmodulin class - ii ( cam - ii ) like kinase , the cd loop may represent an sh3 domain recognition region  @xcite . in experiments and simulations performed on the c5 domain alone , the cd loop due to its high mobility , destabilizes the protein , lowering its folding temperature . in vivo , however , the cd loop may fold upon binding with the cam - ii - like kinase , so that the thermodynamic stability and the folding temperature of the protein may be similar to those of the other ig domains .",
    "our results also suggest that the cardiac c5 domain might regulate the activity of the cam - ii - like kinase whose docking may trigger the folding of the cd loop . in such a case , the c5 domain may be not only a structural component of the moolman - smook collar ( fig .",
