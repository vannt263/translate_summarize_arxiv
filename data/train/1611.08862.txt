    "@xcite , studies a simple way to compare two correlated proportions .",
    "more recently , @xcite presents the exact likelihood ratio test for equality of two normal populations .",
    "we present a procedure to do an exact inference with the p - value of the likelihood ratio test ( lrt ) .",
    "we called it p - value , with capital letter p , to differentiate it from the asymptotic p - value .",
    "the aim is to compare the behavior of the frequentist lrt asymptotic p - value , the lrt exact p - value , the fisher s test exact p - value , the chi - square test asymptotic p - value , and the bayesians asymptotic e - value @xcite and the approximation ( markov chain monte carlo ) of the exact e - value .",
    "all significance indices considered here , including the p - value and the bayesian e - value , are in agreement with the asa s statement on significance indices @xcite .",
    "we discuss indices for homogeneity , independence , and hardy - weinberg equilibrium hypotheses @xcite in contingency tables .",
    "the p - value is mainly based on the work of @xcite .",
    "the idea consists of evaluating the probability of sampling any table on the sample space under the null hypothesis and then compute the test statistics for all possible tables .",
    "the main problem we faced is that it is a time consuming computational procedure , and it is only feasible for small sample sizes and/or for tables of small dimensions .",
    "the likelohhod ratio test ( lrt ) asympthotic p - value @xcite , the chi - square test asympthotic p - value @xcite , fisher s homogeneity exact test @xcite , and the full bayesian significance test ( fbst ) asymptotic and exact e - value @xcite are presented in detail for the case of @xmath0 contingency tables considering homogeneity hypothesis ( section [ sec_homo22 ] ) . the homogeneity and independence for tables of any dimension and hardy - weinberg equilibrium hypothesis are discussed in sections [ sec_homo ] , [ sec_ind ] and [ sec_hw ] .",
    "we study the relationship between indices in section [ sec_compare ] . in a similar study",
    ", @xcite considers continuous random variables using the e - value and the lrt p - value .",

    "moreover , the present results are not based on a simulation study ; we compute the indices for all possible tables .    regarding the frequentist tests , a study of power functions",
    "is performed to compare the indices for the homogeneity hypothesis ( @xmath4 tables ) and hardy weinberg equilibrium hypothesis ( section [ sec_power ] ) .",
    "the fisher s exact test was the least powerful one , followed by the chi - square test , the exact lrt ( p - value ) and the asymptotic lrt , the most powerful one .",
    "we did not evaluate the power function for the fbst because to do so it is necessary to define a decision rule , which is not our aim , and , apart from that , it is a time - consuming procedure .",
    "section [ sec_final ] presents our final comments .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be two random variables , represented in table [ tab_cont ] , @xmath7 and @xmath8 being their observed values , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 fixed sample sizes . consider the distributions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 as @xmath11 and @xmath6 a @xmath12 for describing the chances of a subject belong to category @xmath13 in two distinct populations being compared .",
    "both populations are partitioned into two categories @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the interest is to test homogeneity among the two unknown population frequencies , @xmath15 .",
    "this hypothesis is geometrically represented in figure [ fig_hyp_homo ] .",

    "[ fig_hyp_homo],scaledwidth=47.0% ]    .[tab_cont ] contingency table @xmath0 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figures [ fig_indices_homo ] , [ fig_indices_ind ] and [ fig_indices_hw ] illustrate the results of the above discussion .",
    "for all hypotheses , exact and asymptotic e - values are very similar for both large and small sample sizes . in another direction ,",
    "p - values and asymptotic p - values , both lrt and chi - square , are also very similar to each other .",
    "the difference found between e - values in comparison with both p - values and p - values happens as a result of the way these indices are developed .",
    "while e - values consider the full dimension of the parameter space ( m degrees of freedom ) , p- and p - values consider the complementary dimension of the set of hypothesis @xmath16 ( @xmath17 degrees of freedom ; @xmath18 is the dimension of the parameter sub - space defined by @xmath16 ) .",
    "this is expected from the asymptotic relationship between e - value and p - value from the lrt ( pereira et al .",
    "2008 , diniz et al .",
    "fisher s exact test was only calculated for homogeneity hypothesis in @xmath0 tables .",
    "it is the only index with a different behavior of its p - value .",
    "this is not surprising , since it is a conditional exact test .",
    "looking at the plots , its values are not forming a continuous curve , like the other indices , and its points are quite far from all the other indexes .",
    "the power function analyses of the frequentist tests for the homogeneity hypothesis in @xmath0 table and hardy - weinberg equilibrium hypothesis is the object of the next section .",
    "power functions are a useful tool to compare hypothesis tests . for all @xmath19 ,",
    "the power function provides the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis for a given @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , we look for a test that does not reject the null hypothesis for @xmath21 and the further the @xmath20 value is from the null hypothesis , the probability of rejection increases .",
    "the power functions presented are the ones that we are able to represent in @xmath22 , which are the power functions for the homogeneity hypothesis in @xmath0 contingency tables and the hardy - weinberg equilibrium hypothesis .",
    "we used p - values less than @xmath23 as a decision rule to reject the null hypothesis . in this case ,",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25    we obtain the power function for all tests but the fbst . for the best of our knowledge , there is no analytical form for the power function of these tests , therefore we used a monte carlo procedure to evaluate it .",
    "we consider a grid for the unit square with @xmath26 points in the axis @xmath27 .",
    "for each point in the grid we generated 1000 tables .",
    "from these 1000 tables we evaluate the proportion of rejections , which is an approximation for the power function .",
    "we plot pairs of power functions , in order to illustrate their shapes . for homogeneity hypothesis in a table with marginals @xmath28 , figure [ fig_power ] shows that fisher s exact is less powerful than the chi - square test , while the chi - square is less powerful than the proposed p - value , which is less powerful than the asymptotic p - value for the lrt . to verify that , we also calculate the differences between power functions from different tests in all points of the grid .",
    "figure [ fig_boxplots ] presents the boxplots for these differences .",
    "figure [ fig_box_10 ] consists of the difference between power functions for tables with marginal equals to @xmath28 .",
    "it shows that the use of the asymptotic p - value for the lrt results in a more powerful test than the other indices . when comparing the proposed p - value , it s more powerful than the chi - square test and the fisher s exact test .",
    "between the chi - square and the fisher s test , the chi - square test is more powerful .    for a higher sample ( marginals @xmath29 ) ,",
    "the boxplots are more concentrated near @xmath30 ( figure [ fig_box_100 ] ) , showing that all indices are more alike .",
    "the ordering still exists , but it is less severe . the only tests that show a different behavior than when considering marginals @xmath28 are the exact lrt ( p - value ) and the chi - square test .",
    "their difference assumes some negative and some positive values , all very close to zero , indicating that their power functions are very similar .",
    "it is interesting to point out that , as expected , the chi - square test works better with larger samples , even archiving a power function very alike one obtained from an exact index .    for hardy - weinberg hypothesis ,",
    "the results are similar as shown in figures [ fig_powerhw ] and [ fig_boxplotshw ] .",
    "after evaluating the indices for tables in different scenarios , we noticed that all of them had a very similar behaviors independent of the perspective ( bayesian or frequentist ) , sample size and table dimension . the exception is the p - value for the fisher s exact test for homogeneity hypothesis in @xmath0 tables , which shows distinct behavior .",
    "this seem to be a consequence of the drastic reduction of the sample space .",
    "studying the power functions considering @xmath0 tables homogeneity hypothesis and hardy - weinberg equilibrium hypothesis , the lrt presented itself as the most powerful test when considering small sample sizes , while fisher s exact test was the least powerful one . by enlarging sample sizes ,",
    "the power of these tests increase accordingly .      *",
    "the ltr asymptotic p - value seems to be a good frequentist alternative for both large , as expected , and small sample sizes . *",
    "since there is an asymptotic relationship between the p - value for the lrt and the e - value ( fbst ) , we consider that both indices are equivalent under a non - informative prior ; * there is a close relationship between the ltr p - value and the fbst exact e - value that goes toward their asymptotic relationship as sample size increases .",
    "therefore , under non - informative priors we consider these indices equivalent . *",
    "taking into account available information besides the data , represented by informative priors , the e - value is more appropriate index than a frequenstist one .",
