    "many black holes and neutron stars are in binaries where a steady - state accretion disk ( one that supplies matter to the compact object at the same rate as the mass is donated from the companion ) is thermally unstable @xcite .",
    "this thermal instability results in a limit cycle  as in dwarf novae  with matter accumulating in the outer disk for @xmath3months to decades until a thermal instability is reached ( see ) , triggering rapid accretion onto the compact object , and a substantial x - ray brightening ( typically by @xmath4 or more , up to @xmath5 ) .",
    "both neutron star ( ns ) and black hole candidate ( bhc ) systems exhibit these x - ray outbursts , separated by periods ( @xmath3 months to decades ) of relative quiescence ( for recent reviews , see ) .",
    "deep pointed x - ray observations of these transients in quiescence have found that bhcs are , on average , less luminous in quiescence than their ns counterparts @xcite . to explain the higher quiescent luminosities (   ) of the transient nss , narayan  @xcite suggested that matter continues to accrete during quiescence onto both objects , and that neutron stars re - radiate the in - falling matter s kinetic energy , while black holes swallow most of the accreted mass - energy . in this picture , the required quiescent accretion rate , @xmath6 , onto the compact object in bhc systems must be substantially greater than in ns systems .",
    "current spectral modeling ( for an advection dominated flow ) of the few x - ray detected bhc s use @xmath6 of @xmath3 @xmath7 of the total mass transfer rate in the binary @xcite whereas the more efficient energy release onto a neutron star requires that @xmath8 be smaller by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "the cause of this difference in @xmath6 between the bhc and ns systems is not easily explained ( ) .",
    "an alternative picture for the ns emission was put forward by brown , bildsten , & rutledge @xcite , who showed that nss radiate a minimum luminosity , even if accretion completely ceases during quiescence .",
    "this minimum luminosity comes from energy deposited in the inner crust ( at a depth of @xmath3300 m ) during the large accretion events .",
    "the freshly accreted material compresses the inner crust and triggers nuclear reactions that deposit @xmath9 per accreted baryon there @xcite .",
    "this heats the ns core on a - yr timescale , until it reaches a steady - state temperature @xmath10 @xcite , where @xmath11 is the time - averaged accretion rate in the binary .",
    "a core this hot makes the ns incandescent , at a luminosity @xmath12 , even after accretion halts @xcite .",
    "the ns is then a thermal emitter in quiescence , much like a young ns .    for both hypotheses , the energy source for the quiescent luminosities of the bhcs and nss",
    "have different physical causes , making it meaningful to search for distinguishing spectral signatures .",
    "the first ns transient detected in quiescence was 4@xcite .",
    "more recently , quiescent x - ray spectral measurements have been made of  @xcite and 4u  2129 + 47 @xcite with the _ rosat_/pspc ; of exo  0748@xmath0676 with einstein ipc @xcite ; and of 4  and 1608  with _ asca_@xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of  ( 0.42.4 ) was consistent with a blackbody ( bb ) spectrum , a bremsstrahlung spectrum , or a pure power - law spectrum @xcite . for 1608 ,",
    "the spectrum ( 0.510.0 ) was consistent with a bb ( @xmath13 ) , a thermal raymond - smith model ( @xmath14 ) , or a very steep power - law ( photon index @xmath15 ) . similar observations of 4  with _ asca _  found its x - ray spectrum consistent with these same models , but with an additional power - law component ( photon index @xmath16 ) above 5.0  ( recent observations with _ bepposax _  of  in quiescence also revealed a power - law tail ; ) .",
    "the origin of the observed power - law spectral components in 4  and  is not clear .",
    "while it has been suggested they may be due to magnetospheric accretion @xcite , spectral models of metallic ns atmospheres @xcite also predict hard tails . these warrant further observational investigation .",
    "the observation of exo  0748@xmath0676 shows it to be more luminous ( by @xmath17 ) than the other four nss .    in four of these five sources ( the exception being exo  0748@xmath0676 ) , bb fits implied an emission area of radius @xmath18 , much smaller than a ns .",
    "this had little physical meaning however , as the emitted spectrum from a quiescent ns atmosphere with light elements at the photosphere is far from a blackbody .",
    "for a weakly - magnetic ( @xmath19 g ) pure hydrogen or helium ) stratify the atmosphere ( ) ; for accretion rates @xmath20 ( corresponding to an accretion luminosity @xmath21 ) , metals will settle out of the photosphere faster than the accretion flow can supply them ( bildsten , salpeter , & wasserman ) . as a result",
    ", the photosphere should be nearly pure hydrogen .",
    "] atmosphere at effective temperatures @xmath22@xmath23 the opacity is dominated by free - free transitions ( ) . because of the opacity s strong frequency dependence ( @xmath24 ) , higher energy photons escape from deeper in the photosphere , where @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "spectral fits of the wien tail ( which is the only part of the spectrum sampled with current instruments ) with a bb curve then overestimate @xmath26 and underestimate the emitting area , by as much as orders of magnitude @xcite52 and puppis a produced a source distance consistent with that measured through other means ( assuming a 10  km ns radius ) , a lower surface temperature , and an x - ray measured column density that was consistent with that measured from the extended snr ( while the column density measured with an assumed bb spectrum was not consistent with other measurements ; ) . ] .",
    "rutledge  @xcite showed that fitting the spectra of quiescent ns transients with these models yielded emitting areas consistent with a 10  km radius ns . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsbbhatm ] , we compare the measured h atmosphere and blackbody spectral parameters for the quiescent nss . the data for 4u  2129 + 47 is analysed here , while the other sources were analysed previously @xcite .",
    "the emission area radii are larger from the h atmosphere spectra by a factor of a few to ten , and are consistent with the canonical radius of a ns .",
    "there is thus both observational evidence and theoretical motivation that thermal emission from a pure hydrogen photosphere contributes to  and perhaps dominates  the ns luminosity at photon energies at 0.11 kev .",
    "this makes possible the use of quiescent ns x - ray spectra as an astrophysical tool .      distinguishing between a stellar - mass black hole and a neutron star in an x - ray binary is a non - trivial observational problem .",
    "although there are x - ray phenomena unique to nss ( for example , type  i x - ray bursts and coherent pulsations ) , as yet , no x - ray phenomenon predicted to occur exclusively in bhs has been observed . in the absence of any distinctive ns properties ,",
    "some x - ray transients are classified as bhc s if they display x - ray spectral and variability properties similar to those of other bhcs , such as @xmath330% rms frequency - band - limited variability accompanied by a hard spectrum , or 3 - 12 hz quasi - periodic oscillations while the source has high x - ray intensity , although there are ns systems which display these properties as well ( see for a review ) .",
    "while a statistical distinction between the quiescent luminosities of bhcs and nss has been demonstrated ( see refs . in the introduction ) , there is overlap in the observed luminosities ; thus , while the different average quiescent luminosities support the hypothesis that the ( pre - classified ) objects belong to distinct classes , quiescent luminosity can not be used to distinguish bewteen a ns and a bhc on a case - by - case basis .",
    "a promising phenomenological distinction between nss and bhcs is that , at x - ray luminosities @xmath27  , the 20 - 200 kev luminosity of bhcs is systematically higher than that of nss .",
    "however , the physical origin of this difference is not known , and the weakness of a phenomenological distinction is its vulnerability to a single counter example @xcite .    by far the most solid technique is measuring or constraining the mass of the compact object via radial velocity measurements of the optical companion .",
    "if the resulting optical mass function indicates that the compact object mass exceeds 3@xmath28 , then it is likely to be a black hole , as the mass - limit of a ns has been calculated to be below 3.2@xmath28@xcite .",
    "the large amount of progress in this method has given us several very secure black holes @xcite .    a new spectroscopic distinction between transient nss and bhs  based on the presence of a neutron star s photosphere",
    " would be a valuable classification tool .",
    "we present the first such comparisons here , where we report a spectral analysis that uses an accurate emergent spectrum from a ns to fit the quiescent x - ray spectra of six transient bhcs with measured mass - functions ( , , , , , and 404cyg ) and four transient neutron stars .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : data ] by describing the bhc s and ns s we have chosen for this comparison , as well as the hydrogen atmosphere models .",
    "three of the ns are from our previous study @xcite , , 4 , 1608 ; and we discuss a fourth here , 4u  2129 + 47 .",
    "we show in   [ sec : comparison ] , that although the neutron stars occupy a narrow range of effective temperatures and emitting area radii , no such relation is found among the bhcs .",
    "this implies that the h atmosphere spectrum may be used as a tool to distinguish between nss and bhcs in quiescence ( in the absence of other information ) .",
    "section [ sec : energysource ] discusses the state of our observational understanding of the energy source for the quiescent emission from the nss .",
    "we conclude in   [ sec : conclude ] by summarizing and briefly discussing the application of this work to x - ray sources in globular clusters .",
    "our purpose in fitting the h atmosphere model ",
    "appropriate only for nss  to the bhc data is to directly compare the measured spectral parameters of the bhcs to those of nss .",
    "we selected bhcs for analysis from among those in table 1 of menou  @xcite , which contains a list of 8 compact binary systems with implied masses 3@xmath28 .",
    "three of these systems ( , 404cyg , and ) were detected in x - rays in quiescence ( at luminosities  ) , the data for which we analyse ; the remaining five have upper limits in their luminosity .",
    "we analyse the three with luminosity upper - limits below  ( , , and ) to investigate the constraints on emission area radius as a function of surface temperature .",
    "the remaining two sources with high luminosity upper - limits @xmath29  ( n oph 1977 and 4u 1543@xmath047 ) are consistent with or greater than the luminosities from nss @xcite , and therefore they can not be excluded as nss based on a spectral comparison ; we do not investigate them here .",
    "brief descriptions of the analysed observations are in table  [ tab : datasets ] .",
    "data were obtained from the public archive at heasarc / gsfc .",
    "all observations analysed are listed in table  [ tab : datasets ] ; all were performed with _ rosat_/pspc , except for those of , which were performed with _ asca _ , and one observation of , which was performed with _",
    "rosat_/hri .    for our spectral fits and derived parameters , we adopted column densities using the conversion of @xmath30 @xcite and @xmath31 @xcite , except where noted .",
    "we extracted the data for each source as described in the appendix , and fit each extracted spectrum with a spectral model of galactic absorption and a tabulated h atmosphere model @xcite , using xspec @xcite .",
    "the h atmosphere model is determined by two spectral parameters : an effective temperature ( @xmath22 ) and the ratio of an emission area radius ( @xmath32 ; the true radius , which would be measured as the circumference of the ns , divided by 2@xmath33 ) to source distance . in our results , we quote @xmath32 by assuming a source distance ( which can be uncertain by a factor of 2 , and therefore represents a considerable systematic uncertainty in both the nss and bhcs ) .",
    "the h atmosphere spectrum we used assumes the surface gravity of a 1.4@xmath28 , 10 km object .",
    "it is possible to adopt the surface gravity as an additional parameter to the h atmosphere model ; however , the available data are of insufficient quality to constrain simultaneously all 3 parameters .",
    "we discuss in the appendix the column densities adopted for each individual source . in quiescence , the s / n of the data is typically not sufficient to measure the x - ray equivalent column density for the assumed spectrum .",
    "we thus adopt an historically measured value of , taken either from : ( 1 ) x - ray absorption observed while the object is x - ray bright ; ( 2 ) optical reddening , which has been measured proportional to the equivalent hydrogen column density ; or ( 3 ) the neutral hydrogen column density from radio observations @xcite taken from the w3nh tool at heasarc , which measures the integrated column density not just to the distance of the x - ray object , but through the galaxy .",
    "all of these methods , when applied to estimating the  during x - ray quiescence , have systematic errors sufficient to produce @xmath27100% uncertainties in the implied emission area and surface temperature ( see discussion in ) .",
    "in addition , there are observations suggesting a column density that varies over timescales of months to years , between outbursts of transients .",
    "an example is a change of @xmath34 in 4u  1608@xmath0522 @xcite over several months .",
    "this uncertainty in  can only be overcome by high s / n data in x - ray quiescence , which can permit a direct measurement of  during the observation .",
    "interpretation of the results of the present analysis must bear this systematic uncertainty in mind .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : nsbhcs ] , we compare the measured spectral parameters @xmath22  and @xmath32 of quiescent nss and bhcs .",
    "error bars are 90% confidence , as are upper - limits . for the four nss in this analysis , the @xmath22  and @xmath32 were constrained , with best - fit @xmath22  in the range 0.080.20  kev , and @xmath32 in the range 812  km . the nss exhibit a significant range in temperature , possibly due to different core temperatures ( related to @xmath11 ) .",
    "the data are of sufficient quality to constrain @xmath32 to within a factor of 2 for the nss ( not accounting for the uncertainties in source distance ) , and the resulting @xmath32 are consistent with objects of 10  km radius .",
    "the two connected points for  are for two different distances ( 2.0 and 4.0 kpc ) .",
    "the two connected points for 4u  2129 + 47 are discussed in the analysis section  [ sec:2129 ] .",
    "we note that recent observations @xcite have resolved the optical counterpart of  into two objects , only one ( at most ) will be associated with the x - ray system ; most likely , this observation implies a distance to greater than previous estimates , although a new distance estimate has not yet been produced .",
    "the spectra of five of the six bhcs were of insufficient statistics to simultaneously constrain both @xmath32 and @xmath22  of the h atmosphere model .",
    "the exception ( 404cyg ) was significantly harder than the ns spectra , which constrained the @xmath22  to be above those observed from the nss .",
    "the bhcs , ,  and  have spectral parameters which are , within errors , consistent with those of the nss .  and , if we presumed these to be nss of the same surface area and gravity , must be cooler ( 0.05  kev ) than the average observed transient nss .",
    "the spectrum of  is discrepant with those of the nss , implying substantially smaller emission area ( @xmath35 ) for the range of @xmath22  observed from the nss .",
    "the addition of a power - law spectral component  such as the hard power - law tail as observed from cen x-4 in _ asca _ data , and detected in aql  x-1 in bepposax data  introduces enough uncertainty in the h atmosphere spectral parameters of bhcs that all sources would be consistent with those we observe from the nss . in noting this systematic uncertainty , we point out that additional spectral components are not demanded by the data we have used , although the data is largely of low - bandwidth ( 0.4 - 2.4 kev ) , and that wider bandwith data ( such as from _ asca _ , _ chandra _ , or _ xmm _ )",
    "may alter this .",
    "in practice , we have neglected this systematic uncertainty to investigate the question : if these bhc sources were discovered in quiescence , and their h atmosphere spectral parameters were compared with those from known nss , would we conclude they are similar or dissimilar to the nss ? for gs  2023 + 33 and a0620@xmath000 , we find that they are dissimilar ; while for gro j1655@xmath040 , gs1124@xmath0683 , gs2000 + 25 , and gro j0422 + 32 , we find they are consistent ( albeit with a wide range of values as well ) .",
    "higher signal - to - noise data , taken with an instrument of wider bandwidth , would permit us greater certainty regarding the possible contributions of spectral parameters for which we have not here accounted .    moreover , no bhc has well - constrained spectral parameters which would place it exclusively within the parameter space occupied by the nss , as depicted on fig .  [",
    "fig : nsbhcs ] .",
    "this is a phenomenologically defined region , which would have to be expanded with the discovery of nss in quiescence outside of this box .",
    "thus , we find no evidence that any of the bhcs have been misclassified , and should be re - classified as nss .",
    "there are presently no observational results which exclude that part of the quiescent luminosity of these nss is due to accretion .",
    "brown et al . ( 1998 ) noted a few observational tests which can be applied to determine whether accretion is active .",
    "first , as accretion will increase source luminosity ( at this low luminosity level ) , the spectra should be drawn when sources are at their lowest observed luminosity in the x - ray passband .",
    "second , since the h atmosphere thermal flux is expected to be variable only on timescales of longer than @xmath3months to @xmath36 yr , variability on timescales less than this ( days ) likely indicates active accretion .",
    "second , active accretion onto the ns surface will produce metal absorption lines in the spectrum ( o and fe , below 1 kev ) , which can be observed with _",
    "chandra _ and xmm , but which can not be observed with _",
    "asca _ or _ rosat_. the presence of photospheric absorption metal lines in the spectrum  aside from being observationally important",
    " will indicate active accretion onto the ns surface .",
    "these indicators should be used to insure that the observed ns emission is not due to active accretion ( in addition to being observationally consistent with the theoretical h atmosphere spectrum ) . since",
    "present instrumentation is not capable of detecting the lines , we can only apply the variability and observed luminosity criteria .",
    "if accretion is occuring during quiescence , this will increase the @xmath22  of an emergent h atmosphere spectrum , and produce metal absorption lines ; accretion will not affect @xmath32 , unless emission originates from a different surface than the ns ( such as in an accretion disk ) .",
    "some observational evidence suggests that accretion is indeed occurring onto the ns surface during quiescence ; long - term ( months - years ) variability in the observed flux has been reported ( for 4u  2129 + 47 , see app .",
    "[ sec:2129var ] and ; for 4 , ) . while this variability can be explained by a variable absorption column depth , active accretion during quiescence is also a possibility .",
    "however , recent observations of  at the end of an outburst showed an abrupt fading into quiescence @xcite associated with a sudden spectral hardening @xcite .",
    "this was followed by a period of @xmath315 days , over which the source was observed ( three times ) with a constant flux level @xcite .",
    "this behavior was interpreted as the onset of the `` propellor effect '' @xcite in this object , which would inhibit  perhaps completely  accretion from the disk onto the ns .",
    "the energy source for the long - term nearly constant flux is then a puzzle . unlike the accretion - powered models , the work of brown et al .",
    "( 1998 ) makes a specific prediction for this constant flux level , relating it to the long term time - averaged accretion rate .    so as to minimize any contributions from accretion , we only analyse observations made during periods of the lowest observed flux .",
    "we calculate the bolometric luminosity from the h atmosphere fits .",
    "the fits are given in terms of an ( unredshifted ) effective temperature ( @xmath22 ) and emitting area radius ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the observed bolometric flux is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the source distance , and the observed bolometric luminosity is @xmath39 . for a ns of @xmath40 and @xmath41 radius ,",

    "four of the five nss are within the band where the quiescent luminosity is that expected when the emitted heat is between 0.1 - 1.0 mev per accreted baryon .",
    "the fifth ns ( exo  0748@xmath0676 ) , has a higher quiescent luminosity ( by a factor of 10 ) , which we interpret as being due to continued accretion , an interpretation which is reinforced by the observation of spectral variability during the quiescent observations with _ asca _",

    "this suggests the ns quiescent luminosity is more strongly related to the accreted energy than the bh quiescent luminosities .",
    "we have fit the quiescent x - ray spectra of four transient nss and six transient bhcs ( with measured mass functions ) with a pure h atmosphere spectrum .",
    "we compared the emitting area radius and effective temperature of the ten sources and found that the nss are clustered in ( @xmath32 , @xmath22 ) parameter space .",

    "the upper - limits of the parameter space of  and  are marginally consistent with the observed ( @xmath32 , @xmath22 ) of the nss , indicating that these bhcs , if interpreted as nss , would have to be cooler than the average ns observed in quiescence .",
    "we found that the x - ray spectra excludes  and 404cyg  from being nss of the type we used for comparison .",
    "these differences between the quiescent x - ray spectra of bhcs and nss can not be directly attributed to an observational selection effect .",
    "the nss were identified by the type  i x - ray bursts , the bhcs were first identified by their x - ray variability behavior and later by the high ( 3@xmath28 ) implied mass of the compact object .",
    "the x - ray spectra of , , , and  are consistent with those of the nss , but their parameter space is large , and better data are needed to determine whether they are spectrally similar or not .",
    "our method can be applied to objects which have low x - ray luminosities ( @xmath51  ) , to identify them as neutron stars , which have an atmosphere from which the theoretical emission originates , or as some object which is not a ns , as we have done here .",
    "in addition to the transient field objects , this method can be readily applied to the low - luminosity x - ray sources observed in globular clusters @xcite which are thought to be cataclysmic variables @xcite , but may also be transient neutron stars in quiescence @xcite .",
    "x - ray spectroscopic determination can identify these objects as nss radiating thermal emission from the atmosphere , or imply a different origin for the emission . as discussed above and elsewhere",
    "@xcite , the quiescent luminosities of these sources are set by the time average accretion rate .",
    "thus , the low luminosity ( @xmath52  ) x - ray sources in globular clusters , if they were transient neutron stars in quiescence , would have @xmath53 @xmath28@xmath54 ; comparing this to aql  x-1 , with @xmath55 @xmath28@xmath56 ( estimated from the rxte / asm lightcurve history ) , and a mean outburst interval of @xmath57 200 days , the low - luminosity x - ray sources would have aql  like outbursts with recurrence times of @xmath3250 yr , assuming the quiescent luminosity is in steady - state with accretion .",
    "the estimated number of such sources down to this luminosity level is highly uncertain , about 1 - 10 per globular cluster @xcite . for @xmath3200 gcs in the galaxy ,",
    "one expects @xmath31 - 10 such transients per year . even assuming only 1/4 of all gcs are within distance to detect an aql  x-1-like transient with the rxte / asm ( for a peak rxte / asm detection countrate of 10 c / s ; aql  x-1 has an asm peak countrate of @xmath330 c / s ) ,",
    "this produces an expected transient discovery rate of 0.3 - 3 per year , which is consistent with or greater than the observed discovery rate with rxte / asm ( of no sources over a four - year period ) .",
    "stronger constraints could be made with more sensitive all - sky monitoring observations over longer time - baselines , or with a more tightly constrained luminosity function of the low - luminosity sources in globular clusters .",
    "higher quality x - ray data from the coming x - ray spectroscopy missions ( _ chandra / acis , xmm _ and _ astro - e _ ) will permit this analysis to be performed with greater accuracy , in particular by permitting the simultaneous measurement of the x - ray column density  a dominant systematic uncertainty .",
    "these will also provide the means to account for possible contributions due to a hard - power law component in the bhcs .",
    "for example , a 15  ksec observation with _",
    "chandra _ of a source with photon power - law slope of 2 , and luminosity of 2  , = 0.2 at 1kpc would produce a spectrum which can be excluded as a h atmosphere ( or blackbody ) with an ( unconstrained ) column depth , with probability=6 .",
