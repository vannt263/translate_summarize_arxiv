    "endohedral fullerenes ( endofullerenes ) , due to their unique electronic and geometric structure , have been attracting the interest of chemists , physicists , and material scientists since they were first synthesized in 1985 @xcite .",
    "fullerenes can act as hosts that encapsulate other atoms , molecules , or atomic clusters .",
    "the resulting endofullerenes have initiated considerable research because the entrapped atoms bring with them an array of useful physical properties .",
    "the potential applications include electronic devices @xcite , organic solar cells @xcite , spin - based quantum computing @xcite , and medicine @xcite , specifically contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) as well as radiopharmaceutical candidates @xcite .",
    "endofullerenes created by an arc - vaporization technique @xcite have been known to encapsulate up to three individual metal atoms as well as clusters of the form m@xmath0n , m@xmath0c@xmath8 , m@xmath8c@xmath8 , and m@xmath9o@xmath8 ( m = sc , y , and several lanthanides ) @xcite .",
    "the possible isolation of magnetic or radioactive molecules from the surrounding environment have made endofullerenes interesting for many fields .",
    "in particular , the gd@xmath0n@c@xmath3 family has received much interest due to their application as mri contrast agents and the confinement of three paramagnetic gd ions in a relatively small space ( @xmath10 1 nm ) .",
    "the vibrational modes involving the movement of the encapsulated species are a fingerprint of the interaction between the fullerene cage and the metal complex . based on the mode frequencies , the experimental value of the metal@xmath2cage bond strength can be determined and the amount of charge transfer from the cage to the core can be investigated @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that some isolated fullerene cages , though electronically unstable , can bind strongly to the metal core and become stable @xcite .",
    "although certain gadolinium endofullerenes have been isolated and studied by x - ray diffraction , vibrational spectroscopy has not been performed on a number of species @xcite .    in this paper , we present a detailed raman and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) analysis of gd@xmath0n@c@xmath1 , as well as conductance measurements demonstrating a kondo effect .",
    "raman analysis of gd@xmath0n@c@xmath3 ( 40 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath4 44 ) has been performed , as well as y@xmath0n@c@xmath1 , lu@xmath0n@c@xmath1 , and y@xmath0n@c@xmath6 for comparison .",
    "vibrational assignments of the gd@xmath0n@c@xmath1 molecule , i@xmath11c@xmath12 cage , and intrinsic gd@xmath0n cluster were carried out by density functional theory ( dft ) and universal force field ( uff ) calculations .",
    "hindered rotations , shown by both theory and experiment , indicate the formation of a gd@xmath0n@xmath2c@xmath1 bond which reduces the ideal icosahedral symmetry of the c@xmath1 cage .",
    "an isolated gd atom has a large magnetic moment of 8 @xmath13 , where 7 @xmath13 is derived from localized @xmath14 electrons @xcite .",
    "when embedded inside a fullerene , the gd atom bonds through the delocalized @xmath15 and @xmath16 electrons and the localized @xmath14 states maintain their atomic spin moment @xcite .",
    "the valence state of gadolinium has been determined experimentally by esr ( electron spin resonance ) , xps ( x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ) and x - ray diffraction to be gd@xmath17 @xcite . for the gd@xmath0n@c@xmath3 family",
    ", gd can formally only be in the + 1 charge state , because with three additional electrons , one from each gd , the nitrogen is saturated in a formal @xmath18 charge state . however , the highest charge state is gd@xmath17 and therefore the whole gd@xmath0n cluster can donate six electrons to the cage resulting in ( gd@xmath19)@xmath0n@c@xmath20 .    in the case of endohedral doping ,",
    "the stability and symmetry of the cage depends on the properties of the encapsulated species , mostly on the amount of charge transfer . as a consequence ,",
    "the isomer favored upon incorporation of an atom is usually different than the stable isomer of a hollow cage .",
    "considering gd@xmath0n@c@xmath1 , the i@xmath21 isomer of an isolated c@xmath1 cage is unstable , having a four - fold degenerate homo occupied by only two electrons .",
    "the empty cage would undergo a jahn - teller distortion , leading to an occupied non - degenerate homo and a low - lying triply degenerate lumo .",
    "however , the transfer of six additional electrons from the three gd@xmath17 atoms stabilizes the i@xmath11c@xmath1 by completely filling the homo orbital @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the intrinsic gd@xmath0n cluster and the c@xmath1 cage do not exist independently , but when combined form a stable molecule with a closed shell structure .",
    "the structure of gd@xmath0n@c@xmath1 has been determined by x - ray diffraction and the gd@xmath0n unit is found to be pyramidal within the i@xmath21 cage , with the three gd atoms positioned over the centers of hexagons @xcite . unlike light mass pyramidal molecules , such as nh@xmath0 , the n atom is not able to tunnel through the gd@xmath0 plane due to a high energy barrier .",
    "however , when the intrinsic gd@xmath0n molecule is encapsulated in the c@xmath1 cage the charge coupling effectively lowers the energy barrier to @xmath10 91 mev , which allows tunneling to be possible @xcite .",
    "as the cluster has a permanent electric dipole moment , the wagging mode involves a fluctuation in the overall dipole moment , which can be observed in the raman spectra ( @xmath10 85 @xmath22 ) @xcite . at room temperature , gd@xmath0n@c@xmath1",
    "is expected to be paramagnetic with the spin fluctuating between two different multiplicities ( m = 0 and 22 ) @xcite .",
    "uv - vis spectrophotometry data for gd@xmath0n@c@xmath3 ( 40 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath4 44 ) are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the samples were isolated by hplc and the purity was confirmed by mass spectrometry .",
    "the endofullerenes were suspended in toluene ( 99.999@xmath23 , sigma - aldrich ) , which was background subtracted , and plotted as a function of wavelength .    0.2 cm    = 3.4 in    -0.4 cm    the spectral onset for gd@xmath0n@c@xmath1 is around 940 nm .",
    "the homo - lumo transition has a doublet structure with absorption maxima at 680 and 710 nm .",
    "the strongest visible absorption of gd@xmath0n@c@xmath1 is at 415 nm , and a shoulder is apparent at 555 nm @xcite .",
    "the spectral onset for gd@xmath0n@c@xmath24 is around 950 nm and there are absorption peaks at 630 nm and 505 nm .",
    "the spectral onset for gd@xmath0n@c@xmath25 is around 985 nm and there are absorption peaks at 915 nm and 635 nm .",
    "the spectral onset for gd@xmath0n@c@xmath26 is around 1005 nm and there is an unusually strong absorption peak at 640 nm , as well as one at 430 nm .",
    "the spectral onset for gd@xmath0n@c@xmath6 is around 960 nm and there are absorption peaks at 740 nm , 545 nm , 460 nm , and 405 nm .    for spectroscopic studies , 10 @xmath27 g of gd@xmath0n@c@xmath3 ( 40 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath4 44 ) were suspended in carbon disulfide ( cs@xmath8 , 99.999@xmath23 , sigma - aldrich ) and used to dropcoat a gold - covered silicon substrate .",
    "the resulting polycrystalline films were dried under ambient conditions and placed in a linkam liquid nitrogen cryostat stage .",
    "raman spectra were studied with 632.8 nm excitation from a hene laser .",
    "the scattered light was collected in the backscattering geometry by a triple - axis spectrometer ( jobin yvon horiba , t64000 ) equipped with a ccd detector .",
    "a resolution of 0.7 @xmath22 ( 1800 gr / mm ) was used for all raman measurements and all measurements used 2.5 mw/@xmath28 laser power , 30 min .",
    "accumulation time , and were performed at 90 k.    the raman spectra observed for gd@xmath0n@c@xmath1 can be roughly divided into four parts : tangential c@xmath1 modes are found between 1000 and 1600 @xmath22 , a gap - like region from 815 to 1000 @xmath22 , radial c@xmath1 modes between 200 and 815 @xmath22 , and a fourth group from 200 @xmath22 and below which has a counterpart only in the spectra of endohedral and polymeric fullerenes which exhibit low energetic gd@xmath2cage , intermolecular , and center of mass ( com ) modes .",
    "low - energy raman modes of gd@xmath0n@c@xmath1 have been observed confirming the coupling between the core and cage by hindered rotation modes ( fig .",
    "0.2 cm    = 3.4 in    -0.4 cm    several prominent modes can be identified such as the c@xmath1 h@xmath29(1 ) squashing mode at 234 @xmath22 , the h@xmath29(2 ) twist mode at 361 @xmath22 , and the a@xmath29(1 ) breathing mode at 430 @xmath22 .",
    "below 200 @xmath22 , several peaks are observed indicating a hindered rotation due to the bonding of gd@xmath0n to the c@xmath1 cage .",
    "other groups have seen evidence for the formation of a m@xmath0n@xmath2c@xmath1 bond which induces a significant reduction of the ideal i@xmath21@xmath2c@xmath1 symmetry @xcite .",
    "a peak at 83.6 @xmath22 appears to be the wagging mode of the nitrogen atom through the gd@xmath0 plane , predicted by theory @xcite .",
    "other com modes are identified , where the cage@xmath2core complex translates relative to the other .",
    "the frequencies of these peaks were compared with the other gadolinium endofullerenes and are listed in table i.    a similar procedure was performed to analyze the vibrational spectrum of the gd@xmath0n@c@xmath3 ( 41 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath4 44 ) family .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the low - energy raman modes are changed as the number of cage atoms increases ( fig .",
    "3 ) . a common mode for all samples arising from the coupling of the motion of the gd complex and the fullerene cage seems to be apparent .",
    "the mode , defined from 140@xmath2165 @xmath22 and identified boldly in table i , can be assigned to the gd@xmath2cage stretching mode .",
    "this particular mode is similar to the vibrational mode reported for gd@c@xmath24 , which exhibits a raman frequency at 155 @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "0.2 cm    = 3.4 in    -0.4 cm    .low - energy raman frequencies ( @xmath22 ) of gd@xmath0n@c@xmath3 ( 40 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath4 44 ) below 200 @xmath22 at 90 k. bold frequencies represent the gd@xmath2cage stretching mode , which appears to be common for all gadolinium samples . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ chp4tab2 ]    the c@xmath12 model accounts only for the charge transfer in endohedral complexes , which is a very simplified approximation of the core@xmath2cage interaction . in reality , the electronic properties of endofullerenes are determined additionally by the hybridization of the core@xmath2cage orbitals . describing the presence of gadolinium only by adding electrons to the cage neglects some important effects arising from gd@xmath2cage chemical bonding .",
    "in such a simple model the extra electrons are delocalized over the whole molecule , whereas more complex calculations for the endofullerenes predict localization of the charge in the vicinity of the chemisorption site .",
    "the intrinsic gd@xmath0n molecule has six vibrational modes , two of which are degenerate .",
    "one mode with a@xmath30 symmetry is a breathing mode or gd@xmath2n symmetric stretch , where the gd triangle expands and contracts . for the a@xmath30 wagging mode or out - of - plane breathing mode , the gd@xmath0 moiety and the central nitrogen atom",
    "are displaced from the molecular plane in opposite directions .",
    "one of the e modes is a doubly - degenerate in - plane mode or asymmetric gd@xmath2n stretching mode .",
    "the other e mode is an out - of - plane normal vibration or scissor mode , which involves changes in the gd@xmath2n@xmath2gd bond angle .",
    "all normal mode vibrations of the free gd@xmath0n molecule are both raman and ir active",
    ".    the normal modes of the free gd@xmath0n molecule have been calculated by uff .",
    "the doubly - degenerate scissor mode or @xmath31 ( gd@xmath2n@xmath2gd ) and asymmetric stretch or @xmath32 ( gd@xmath2n ) have values at 94.8 @xmath22 and 747.8 @xmath22 respectively . the wagging mode or @xmath33 ( gd@xmath0@xmath2n ) has the value of 511.5 @xmath22 , whereas the breathing mode or @xmath34 ( gd@xmath2n ) has a value of 112.1 @xmath22 .",
    "the wagging mode is related to a raman vibrational mode of gdn at 530 @xmath22 reported previously @xcite .",

    "the endofullerenes were characterized by raman spectroscopy , iets , uv - vis spectrophotometry , and molecular modeling ( dft and uff ) .",
    "tangential and radial cage modes , low - energy gd@xmath2cage modes , intermolecular modes , and com modes were identified in the raman spectra .",
    "hindered rotations were observed experimentally and calculated theoretically , indicating the formation of a gd@xmath0n@xmath2c@xmath3 ( 40 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath4 44 ) bond which reduces the symmetry of the cage . as the carbon cage mass increases , a linear frequency downshift of the hindered rotation modes is observed due to a decrease in the bond strength between the core and the cage .",
    "raman studies were conducted on y@xmath0n@c@xmath1 , lu@xmath0n@c@xmath1 and y@xmath0n@c@xmath6 for comparison with the gd@xmath0n@c@xmath3 family .",
