    "the purpose of this paper is to prove existence and uniqueness of a strong solution for ( [ a.3])([a.5 ] ) with ( [ a.1 ] ) or ( [ a.2 ] ) .",

    "similar difficulty already comes up in the linear leak b.c .",
    "( see @xcite )    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "basic symbols , notation , and function spaces are given in section 2 .    in section 3",

    "the weak formulation is given by a variational inequality , to which we prove uniqueness of solutions . to show existence",
    ", we consider a regularized problem , approximate it by galerkin s method , and derive a priori estimates which allow us to pass on the limit to deduce the desired strong solution . using the compatibility condition that @xmath44 must satisfy sbcf , we can adapt @xmath44 to the regularized problem , which makes an essential point in the estimate .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a study of the problem with lbcf .",
    "there are two major differences from sbcf .",
    "first , as was pointed out in the stationary case ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 3.2 ) , we can not obtain the uniqueness of an additive constant for @xmath10 if no leak occurs , namely , @xmath45 on @xmath16 .",
    "second , under lbcf , the quantity @xmath46 need not vanish because @xmath47 can be non - zero .",
    "this fact affects our a priori estimates badly , and we can extract a solution only when the initial leak @xmath48 is small enough . incidentally , if we use the so - called bernoulli pressure @xmath49 instead of standard @xmath10 , the mathematical difficulty arising from ( [ a.4 ] ) are resolved ; nevertheless the leak b.c .  involving the bernoulli pressure is known to cause an unphysical effect in numerical simulations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thereby we employ the usual formulation .",
    "finally , in section 5 we conclude this paper with some remarks on higher regularity .",
    "throughout the present paper , the domain @xmath1 is supposed to be as smooth as required . for the precise regularity of @xmath1 which is sufficient to deduce our main theorems , see remarks [ rem c.10 ] and [ rem d.10 ] .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath50 various generic positive constants depending only on @xmath1 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "when we need to specify dependence on a particular parameter , we write as @xmath51 , and so on .",

    "the dual space of @xmath65 is @xmath66 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
