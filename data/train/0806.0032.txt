    "with the rapid increase in the rate of exoplanet detections , it has become feasible to study their statistical properties ( for a recent review , see udry & santos 2007 ) .",
    "the distributions of their orbital parameters and correlations with host star properties are crucial for our understanding of planet formation . up to feb 2008 ,",
    "over 200 exoplanets have been announced , most of which were detected by the radial velocity ( rv ) technique . among the parameters that can be derived from rv data , the orbital eccentricity has a somewhat unexpected distribution , with an extended tail of high eccentricities ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "although the exact form of this eccentricity distribution is still uncertain to some extent , especially at the lowest eccentricities ( i.e. , comparing the distribution in butler et al .",
    "2006 and in the most recent catalog ) , it is clear that this distribution is quite different from that of the solar system . there have already been several theoretical attempts to explain such an eccentricity distribution ( e.g. , tremaine & zakamska 2004 and references therein ; juric & tremaine 2007 ; ford et al .",
    "2007 ; zhou et al . 2007 ) .    however , the largest current exoplanet catalog ( e.g. , bulter et al .",
    "2006 and their updates , hereafter bulter06 ) is by no means homogeneous .",
    "survey strategies , selection biases in the rv technique and uncertainties in best - fit orbital solutions could all bias the intrinsic distributions of orbital parameters , especially when taken together .",
    "eccentric orbits have larger amplitudes than circular orbits when holding other parameters fixed , while failure to ( time ) resolve the perihelion approach can lead to non - detection for an eccentric orbit system .",
    "these two effects are believed to roughly cancel but detailed simulation is needed ( e.g. , endl et al . 2002 ; cumming 2004 ) .",
    "it is also well known that the errors in least-@xmath0 keplerian solutions become asymmetric for noisy data ( e.g. , ford 2005 ; butler et al .",
    "2006 ) , which is especially true for eccentricity . on the other hand , for circular orbits the eccentricity can only be scattered upward by error , so an obvious bias exists for circular orbits .",
    "as the rv surveys progress , more and more low amplitude ( low signal - to - noise ratio ) detections will be reported .",
    "significant uncertainties remain in the distributions of orbital parameters for those exoplanets using best - fit orbital solutions .",
    "there are already some cases where the orbit eccentricity is poorly constrained by the rv data ( e.g. , jones et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to explore processes that might distort measurements of the shape of the intrinsic eccentricity distribution using synthetic data .",
    "first we investigate the reliability of single keplerian fits to mock rv data sets as function of signal - to - noise ratio , and see if any bias arises from keplerian fitting to noisy data (  [ sec : kep_fit_eff ] ) .",
    "second , we construct statistical models of orbital parameter distributions and pass them through a simulated detection pipeline , in order to see if there is any serious selection effect on eccentricity (  [ sec : stat ] ) .",
    "we discuss our results and apply them to the current rv planet sample in  [ sec : diss ] , and we summarize our findings in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we consider single planet detections throughout the paper . assuming a true orbit ( period @xmath6 , eccentricity @xmath7 , minimal planet mass @xmath1 , argument of periastron @xmath8 , and temporal offset @xmath9 ) and the host star mass @xmath10 , we generate mock rv data sets with gaussian errors @xmath11 as perturbations . for simplicity @xmath11",
    "is assumed to be the same for all data points in a set , but we relax this assumption later (  [ sec : diss ] ) . in practice",
    ", @xmath11 comes from rv measurement errors , stellar jitter and possible existence of multiple planets ( e.g. , ford 2006 ) . following cumming ( 2004 )",
    ", we define the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the semi - amplitude of the theoretical rv curve , and in the limit of @xmath14 we have ( e.g. , cumming et al .",
    "1999 ) , @xmath15 here the amplitude @xmath13 is defined in terms of the intrinsic properties of a planet s orbit , since we `` know '' the true orbital parameters in advance .",
    "in addition to the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath16 , another important quantity is the number of observations @xmath4 . clearly the larger @xmath16 and @xmath4 are , the better the quality of the data set .",
    "we consider planets where the orbital period is shorter than the observational time span .",
    "orbits with periods longer than the time baseline are difficult to detect due to limited sampling and lower amplitude ( e.g. , cumming 2004 ) .",
    "even if detected , the best - fit orbital solution would often be very different from the true one ( shen et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "the observation times are randomly generated within the observational time span , which somewhat mimics the effects of realistic radial velocity sampling .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sn_eff ] we plot the relations of fitted eccentricity , period , minimal planet mass and semi - amplitude to their true values , as functions of @xmath16 , for a specific case with @xmath17 , @xmath18 days , @xmath19 , and eccentricity values @xmath20 at intervals of @xmath21 .",
    "each set of true orbits was used to generate 5000 mock rv data sets with randomly chosen @xmath8 and temporal offset @xmath9 , and with gaussian noise determined from the assumed signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we used the levenberg - marquardt method ( e.g. , press et al .",
    "1992 ) to minimize @xmath0 , and the true orbital parameters were used as an initial guess for the @xmath0 fitting . using the true orbital parameters",
    "as the initial guess greatly speeds up the convergence and increases the rate of successful fits . in the realistic case when we do not know the actual orbital parameters",
    ", the success of a fit also depends on an appropriate initial guess .",
    "we will come back to this point in  [ sec : stat ] .",
    "the mock observational time span @xmath22 was set to be two true periods , but we find almost identical results as long as the period is shorter than the time span . finally , we simulated three values of @xmath23 .    not all attempts to find a keplerian fit will result in a detection . in an actual radial velocity search for planets , some threshold on the false alarm probability ( fap ) , the probability that a signal power will arise purely from noise , of a keplerian fit , is normally used . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a fiducial @xmath24 , which is essentially always satisfied for large @xmath25 and @xmath4 .",
    "there are several ways to estimate the fap using monte carlo simulations or analytical formulae .",
    "for simplicity we have followed the analytical procedure described in cumming ( 2004 ) to estimate the fap : given the least-@xmath0 value @xmath26 from the keplerian fit , and the least-@xmath0 value @xmath27 from the fit of a constant to the data , we calculate a power @xmath28 using eqn .",
    "( 7 ) in cumming ( 2004 ) .",
    "an estimate of the fap is then eqn .",

    "[ fig : sn_eff ] show that the fitted period is fairly accurate . however , for eccentricity and @xmath33 ( and also the amplitude @xmath13 following eqn .",
    "[ eqn : amp ] ) the _ median _ fitted values are biased upward , and this behavior remains for true eccentricities as large as @xmath34 in our simulations .",
    "this is not a failure of the @xmath0 minimization method . in fig .",
    "[ fig : example1 ] we show two examples of keplerian fits where both rv data sets prefer a more eccentric orbit . the biases in @xmath7 and @xmath1 , as well as the scatter around the median , decrease when @xmath16 or @xmath4 increases , as would be naively expected .",
    "these fitting biases result from the fact that , in general , the least-@xmath0 solution is _ not _ an unbiased estimator of the true parameters for the non - linear keplerian model even if the data errors are gaussian . in particular , the probability distribution @xmath35 is not gaussian , where @xmath36 is the set of true parameter and @xmath37 is the best - fit orbital solution ; and it only approaches a gaussian distribution when the errors are small .    to fully take account these biases we need to know @xmath38 for different combinations of @xmath36 , @xmath25 and @xmath4 , which can be explored numerically as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sn_eff ] .",
    "however , for low intrinsic eccentricities ( @xmath39 ) , the apparent fitting bias in eccentricity can be quantitatively understood as follows . while the error in the fitted eccentricity @xmath40 is not gaussian when @xmath40 is comparable to @xmath7 , the fitted @xmath41 and @xmath42 preserve gaussianity much better provided that the intrinsic eccentricity is small ( e.g. , butler et al .",

    " our simulations themselves are more revealing in this case .    a conservative empirical criterion ( based on our numerical experiments ) for a _",

    "if using @xmath62 instead , we found a good approximation is to replace equation ( [ eqn : bias ] ) with @xmath63 which compensates the fitting bias of amplitude at the low @xmath25 end .",

    "our choice of this particular model distribution is because the peak of the _ observed _ eccentricity distribution has shifted from @xmath73 to @xmath74 using the latest exoplanet catalog .",

    "the initial guess for period can be identified using traditional lomb - scargle periodogram ( lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ) , but appropriate initial guesses for @xmath80 $ ] are crucial for the convergence of keplerian fits for orbits with high eccentricities , where the fit can easily be trapped in a local minimum due to the complicated @xmath0 space or fail to converge at all , and hence the planet is undetected .",
    "we have run a substantial number of tests , where we tried a fine grid of @xmath80 $ ] as initial guesses in each keplerian fit .",

    "serendipitous aliasing cases do exist , where the global minimum solution deviates catastrophically from the true orbital parameters , and which are for the most noisy data sets . hence in the realistic case",

    "we have performed simulations of planet detection and orbital parameter fits using mock radial velocity data sets .",
    "two effects that may affect the intrinsic eccentricity distribution are considered : selection bias on eccentricity , and fitting bias in the best - fit orbital solution .",
    "we find that selection bias on eccentricity is negligible , as long as the fitting routine is efficient in finding the global solution . in a realistic survey , this requires a thorough search in the parameter space , and/or with advanced algorithms optimized for the search .",
    "our finding is not in conflict with previous studies ( e.g. , endl et al .",
    "2002 ; cumming 2004 ) , which claim that the detection efficiency decreases for @xmath102 .",
    "this is because in previous studies , the detection efficiency as a function of eccentricity is estimated at fixed @xmath13 while in our study @xmath13 is larger for more eccentric orbits when other parameters are fixed . on the other hand , we find that for detections with low signal - to - noise ratio and small number of observations , the best - fit eccentricity is biased upward in the median value , which then gives rise to a change in the eccentricity distribution from the intrinsic one .",
    "inspection of the current exoplanet sample shows only @xmath94 are likely to be significantly affected by the keplerian fitting bias .",
    "however , future radial velocity surveys will contain an increasing number of low amplitude detections if the number of low mass , large semi - major axis exoplanets grows as rapidly as suggested by extrapolation of current results suggest ( e.g. , udry & santos 2007 ) .",
    "when the sample of low amplitude detections ( on average less massive planets and more circular orbits ) is large enough for statistical study , the bias in the best - fit eccentricity described here must be taken into account .",
    "also , in individual cases where an accurate estimate of eccentricity is required , i.e. , in modeling the habitable zone or tidal heating issues , either high quality rv data or constraints from other observations are required to support reliable conclusions . in the mean time , there is also a need for a more statistically sophisticated understanding of the uncertainties of derived orbital solutions ( e.g. , ford 2005 ; 2006 ) .",
    "our results suggest that the intrinsic eccentricity distribution may be even more peaked at @xmath74 than the current observed distribution .",
    "some planet - planet scattering models tend to produce a rayleigh - distribution of eccentricities ( e.g. , juric & tremaine 2007 ; ford & rasio 2007 ) with reduced circular orbits , therefore certain eccentricity damping mechanism such as interactions with a protoplanetary disk may be required to reconcile these models with observations ."
