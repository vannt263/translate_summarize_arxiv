    "the measurement of the inclusive charm ( @xmath59 ) and beauty ( @xmath60 ) quark cross sections and the derived structure functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 in dis at hera is an important test of the theory of the strong interaction , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , within the standard model .",
    "these measurements uniquely constrain the parton density functions ( pdfs ) of the proton , in particular its @xmath60 and @xmath59 content .",
    "precise knowledge of the pdfs is for example essential at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the predictions of the ` standard candle ' qcd processes at the lhc , such as the inclusive production of @xmath63 and @xmath64 bosons , are sensitive to the theoretical treatment of heavy quarks  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath60 quark density is important in higgs production at the lhc in both the standard model and in extensions to the standard model such as supersymmetric models at high values of the mixing parameter @xmath65@xcite .",
    "this paper reports on measurements made in neutral current deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) at hera of the charm and beauty contributions to the inclusive proton structure function @xmath66 in the range of virtuality of the exchanged photon @xmath67  @xmath68 and bjorken @xmath69 @xmath3 .",
    "the analysis uses the precise spatial information from the h1 vertex detector to separate events containing @xmath59 and @xmath60 flavoured hadrons from light quark events .",
    "the analysis extends to lower and higher @xmath70 than previous h1 measurements  @xcite which used a similar technique to the one used in this paper .",
    "the analysis is based on a dataset with an integrated luminosity of @xmath71  @xmath72 , which is about three times greater than in the previous measurements .",
    "the data was recorded in the years 2006 and 2007 with @xmath73  @xmath72 taken in @xmath0 mode and @xmath74  @xmath72 in @xmath1 mode .",
    "the @xmath75 centre of mass energy is @xmath76 , with a proton beam energy of @xmath77 and electron beam energy of @xmath78 .",
    "this dataset is referred to here as hera  ii .",
    "many details of the analysis are similar to the previous measurements  @xcite , referred to here as hera  i. the hera  i and hera  ii measurements are combined to produce a complete hera dataset .",
    "measurements of the charm contribution to the proton structure function have also been made at hera using @xmath79 or @xmath80 meson production  @xcite .",
    "there are also measurements of charm and beauty in dis using semi - leptonic decays  @xcite .",
    "events containing heavy quarks are distinguished from those containing only light quarks using variables that are sensitive to the longer lifetimes of heavy flavour hadrons .",
    "the most important of these variables are the transverse displacement of tracks from the primary vertex and the reconstructed position of a secondary vertex in the transverse plane . for events with three or more tracks in the vertex detector",
    "the reconstructed variables are used as input to an artificial neural network .",
    "this method has better discrimination between @xmath59 and @xmath60 compared to previous methods  @xcite , which used only the transverse displacement of tracks from the primary vertex .",
    "lifetime based methods have the advantage over more exclusive methods , such as @xmath80 or muon tagging , in that a higher fraction of heavy flavour events may be used , although the background from light quark events is larger .",
    "the charm structure function @xmath61 and the beauty structure function @xmath62 are obtained from the measured @xmath59 and @xmath60 cross sections after applying small corrections for the longitudinal structure functions @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "monte carlo simulations are used to correct for the effects of the finite detector resolution , acceptance and efficiency .",
    "the monte carlo program rapgap@xcite is used to generate dis events for the processes @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a light quark of flavour @xmath87 , @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "rapgap combines @xmath90(@xmath91 ) matrix elements with higher order qcd effects modelled by parton showers .",
    "the heavy flavour event samples are generated according to the ` massive ' photon gluon fusion ( pgf ) matrix element  @xcite with the mass of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 quarks set to @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the dis cross section is calculated using the leading order ( lo ) 3-flavour pdfs from mrst ( mrst2004f3lo  @xcite ) .",
    "the partonic system for the generated events is fragmented according to the lund string model  @xcite implemented within the pythia program  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath59 and @xmath60 quarks are hadronised according to the bowler fragmentation function  @xcite . the heracles program@xcite interfaced to rapgap calculates single photon radiative emissions off the lepton line , virtual and electroweak corrections .",
    "the monte carlo program phojet@xcite is used to simulate the background contribution from photoproduction @xmath94 .",
    "the samples of generated events are passed through a detailed simulation of the detector response based on the geant3 program@xcite , and through the same reconstruction software as is used for the data .",
    "only a short description of the h1 detector is given here ; a more complete description may be found in@xcite .",
    "a right handed coordinate system is employed with the origin at the position of the nominal interaction point that has its @xmath64-axis pointing in the proton beam , or forward , direction and @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) pointing in the horizontal ( vertical ) direction .",
    "the pseudorapidity is related to the polar angle @xmath97 by @xmath98 .",
    "charged particles are measured in the central tracking detector ( ctd ) .",
    "this device consists of two cylindrical drift chambers interspersed with @xmath64-chambers to improve the @xmath64-coordinate reconstruction and multi - wire proportional chambers mainly used for triggering .",
    "the ctd is operated in a uniform solenoidal @xmath99 magnetic field , enabling the momentum measurement of charged particles over the polar angular range @xmath100 .",
    "the ctd tracks are linked to hits in the vertex detector , the central silicon tracker cst  @xcite , to provide precise spatial track reconstruction .",
    "the cst consists of two layers of double - sided silicon strip detectors surrounding the beam pipe , covering an angular range of @xmath101 for tracks passing through both layers .",
    "the information on the @xmath64-coordinate of the cst tracks is not used in the analysis presented in this paper . for ctd tracks with cst hits in both layers",
    "the transverse distance of closest approach ( dca ) to the nominal vertex in @xmath95@xmath96 , averaged over the azimuthal angle , is measured to have a resolution of @xmath102)$ ] where @xmath103 is the transverse momentum of the particle .",
    "the first term represents the intrinsic resolution ( including alignment uncertainty ) and the second term is the contribution from multiple scattering in the beam pipe and the cst .",
    "the track detectors are surrounded in the forward and central directions ( @xmath104 ) by a fine - grained liquid argon calorimeter ( lar ) and in the backward region ( @xmath105 ) by a lead - scintillating fibre calorimeter ( spacal )  @xcite with electromagnetic and hadronic sections .",
    "these calorimeters are used in this analysis to measure and identify the scattered electron and also provide energy and angular reconstruction for final state particles from the hadronic system .",
    "electromagnetic calorimeters situated downstream in the electron beam direction allow detection of photons and electrons scattered at very low @xmath70 .",
    "the luminosity is measured with these calorimeters from the rate of photons produced in the bethe - heitler process @xmath106 .",
    "the events are triggered by requiring a compact , isolated electromagnetic cluster in either the lar or spacal calorimeters with an overall trigger efficiency of almost @xmath107% . the electromagnetic cluster with the highest transverse energy , which also passes stricter offline criteria is taken as the scattered electron .",
    "the @xmath64-position of the interaction vertex , reconstructed by one or more charged tracks in the tracking detectors , must be within @xmath108 to match the acceptance of the cst .",
    "the interaction vertex approximately follows a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of @xmath109 .",
    "photoproduction events and dis events with a hard photon radiated from the initial state electron are suppressed by requiring @xmath110 . here ,",
    "@xmath111 and @xmath112 denote the energy and longitudinal momentum components of a particle and the sum is over all final state particles including the scattered electron and the hadronic final state ( hfs ) .",
    "the hfs particles are reconstructed using a combination of tracks and calorimeter deposits in an energy flow algorithm that avoids double counting@xcite .",
    "the event kinematics , including the photon virtuality @xmath70 , the bjorken scaling variable @xmath69 and the inelasticity variable @xmath113 , are reconstructed with the ` @xmath114 ' method@xcite , which uses the scattered electron and the hfs .",

    "the analysis is restricted to @xmath117 in order to ensure that the direction of the quark which is struck by the photon is mostly in the cst angular range .",
    "an upper @xmath113 cut is applied that varies from @xmath118 at low @xmath70 to @xmath119 at high @xmath70 in order to suppress photoproduction background .",
    "the measurement is made differentially by dividing the data into discrete @xmath113@xmath70 intervals .",
    "this binning scheme is preferable to one using @xmath69@xmath70 boundaries as it avoids event losses near the cuts on @xmath113 .",
    "the rapgap monte carlo program is used to estimate the acceptance of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) events that have a @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) quark with tranverse momentum greater than @xmath120  gev and within the angular acceptance of the cst .",
    "the overall @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) quark acceptance is @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) with a minimum of @xmath123 ( @xmath123 ) in any @xmath113@xmath70 bin .",
    "the position of the beam interaction region in @xmath95@xmath96 ( beam spot ) is calculated from information of tracks with cst hits and updated regularly to account for drifts during beam storage .",

    "the impact parameter @xmath126 of a track , which is the transverse dca of the track to the primary vertex point ( see figure  [ fig : alpha ] ) , is only determined for those tracks which are measured in the ctd and have at least two cst hits linked ( referred to as cst tracks ) .",

    "the algorithm is run in the laboratory frame using all reconstructed hfs particles and the resultant jets are required to have transverse momentum greater than @xmath139  @xmath140 and to be in the angular range @xmath141 .",
    "approximately @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) events have @xmath130 reconstructed from a jet , as determined from the monte carlo simulation .",
    "tracks with azimuthal angle @xmath144 outside @xmath145 of @xmath130 are assumed not to be associated to the struck quark and rejected .",

    "it is defined as negative otherwise .",
    "figure  [ fig : alpha ] shows an example of a track with positive @xmath126 and one with negative @xmath126 .",
    "the @xmath126 distribution , shown in figure  [ fig : dca ] , is seen to be asymmetric with positive values in excess of negative values indicating the presence of long - lived particles .",
    "it is found to be well described by the monte carlo simulation .",
    "cst tracks with @xmath148 are rejected to suppress light quark events containing long - lived strange particles .",
    "the number of reconstructed cst tracks @xmath149 associated to the struck quark is an important quantity since for higher track multiplicities more information can be used . in the kinematic range of this measurement @xmath150 of the events",

    "the complete set of reconstructed tracks in the event is used to simultaneously reconstruct a secondary and primary vertex in the transverse plane .",
    "two vertices are reconstructed in each event even if they are not statistically separable .",
    "each track is assigned a weight for each vertex , which is a measure of the probability that the track originated at that vertex@xcite . in this approach tracks",
    "are not assigned unambiguously to one vertex or the other .",
    "a simultaneous fit to the primary and secondary vertex is made , with the weights of all tracks of the event considered for the primary vertex , but only the weights of cst tracks considered for the secondary vertex . the beam spot",
    "together with its spread is used as an additional constraint to the primary vertex . the vertex configuration that minimises the global @xmath157",
    "is found iteratively using deterministic annealing@xcite .",
    "the transverse distance between the secondary and primary vertex is defined as @xmath158 .",
    "the secondary vertex significance @xmath159 is @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the uncertainty on @xmath158 .",
    "if the absolute difference between the azimuthal angle of the secondary vertex ( taking the primary vertex as the origin ) and @xmath130 is less than @xmath147 , @xmath159 is signed positive and negative otherwise .",
    "a measure of the decay multiplicity @xmath162 is made by counting the number of tracks with weight greater than @xmath163 to the secondary vertex .",
    "this method was shown in  @xcite to yield consistent results with the default method that used track significances .",
    "the track significance is defined as @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the uncertainty on @xmath126 .",
    "the significances @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , are defined as the significance of the cst track with the highest , second highest and third highest absolute significance , respectively .",
    "the significances take the sign of @xmath126 ( see section  [ tracksel ] ) . tracks with a negative sign for significance are likely not to arise from particles with a large lifetime and are used in this analysis to estimate the light quark contribution .",
    "tracks that do not have the same significance sign as @xmath166 are ignored .",
    "the @xmath166 distribution is used for events with one remaining cst track after this selection and the @xmath167 distribution is used if there are two remaining cst tracks . for events with three or more remaining cst tracks ,",
    "where more information is available , information is combined from the significance distributions and the reconstructed secondary vertex using an artificial neural network ( nn ) that takes into account correlations of the input variables  @xcite . in this way",
    "each event with at least @xmath169 cst track appears in exactly one distribution and the distributions are statistically independent .",
    "the @xmath166 and @xmath167 distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : s1s2 ] .",
    "the nn has inputs of @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath159 , @xmath149 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 of the cst tracks with the highest and second highest transverse momentum .",
    "the nn has one hidden layer with @xmath172 nodes .",
    "it was trained using a sample of around @xmath173 monte carlo @xmath60 events as ` signal ' and a similar number of monte carlo @xmath59 events as ` background ' .",
    "no attempt is made to discriminate against the light quark events since their impact is minimized by the subtraction procedure described below .",
    "the same nn is used for all @xmath113@xmath70 bins .",
    "the distributions of the nn inputs are shown in figures  [ fig : nninputsa ] and [ fig : nninputsb ] .",
    "these distributions are dominated by light quark events .",
    "it can be seen that the monte carlo simulation gives a reasonable description of these distributions .",
    "it is also apparent that these distributions have good separation power between light , @xmath59 and @xmath60 events .",
    "the decrease in events around zero for the @xmath166 and @xmath167 distributions is due to the requirement that @xmath174 is taken and the distribution for those events with @xmath175 is subtracted from it .",
    "this has the effect of greatly reducing the light quark distribution which is almost symmetric in @xmath167 .",
    "this subtraction method can be used for any distribution .",
    "the subtracted distributions of the nn inputs are shown in figures  [ fig : nninputsnega ] and  [ fig : nninputsnegb ] .",
    "the monte carlo simulation gives a good description of these distributions .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath60 events tend to have a higher track multiplicity and more tracks at higher @xmath103 .",
    "other distributions are checked in a similar way .",
    "distributions of variables related to the struck quark , @xmath128 and @xmath176 , as well as the kinematic variables @xmath177 and @xmath178 are shown in figure  [ fig : controlneg ] for @xmath179 .",
    "the monte carlo simulation gives a good description of these distributions .",
    "the output of the nn is shown in figure  [ fig : nnoutput ] .",
    "it gives output values in the range from about @xmath180 to @xmath181 .",
    "the nn output is signed according to the sign of @xmath166 .",
    "it can be seen that : the light quark distribution is approximately symmetric and peaks towards low absolute values ; the @xmath59 and @xmath60 distributions are asymmetric with more positive than negative entries ; the @xmath60 events are peaked towards @xmath169 , whereas the @xmath59 events are peaked towards @xmath182 .",
    "the monte carlo simulation gives a good description of the distribution .",
    "since the light quark @xmath166 , @xmath167 and nn distributions are nearly symmetric around zero the sensitivity to the modelling of the light quarks can be reduced by subtracting the contents of the negative bins from the contents of the corresponding positive bins .",
    "the subtracted distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : s1s2nnnegsub ] .",
    "the resulting distributions are dominated by @xmath59 quark events , with a @xmath60 quark fraction increasing towards the upper end of the distributions .",
    "the light quarks contribute a small fraction , although this fraction is larger than in  @xcite , mainly due to the lower @xmath70 and @xmath171 selections in the present analysis .",
    "the fractions of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and light quarks of the data are extracted in each @xmath113@xmath70 interval using a least squares simultaneous fit to the subtracted @xmath166 , @xmath167 and nn distributions ( as in figure  [ fig : s1s2nnnegsub ] ) and the total number of inclusive events before any cst track selection . only those bins in the significance distributions which have at least @xmath183 events before subtraction are considered in the fit , since gaussian errors are assumed .",
    "the last fitted bin of the significance distributions , which usually has the lowest statistics , is made @xmath184 times as wide as the other bins ( see figure  [ fig : s1s2nnnegsub ] ) .",
    "if any of the bins before subtraction within the nn output range contain less than @xmath183 events the bin size is doubled , which ensures all bins contain at least @xmath183 events .",
    "the light , @xmath59 and @xmath60 monte carlo simulation samples are used as templates . the monte carlo light , @xmath59 and @xmath60 contributions in each @xmath113@xmath70 interval are scaled by factors @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 , respectively , to give the best fit to the observed subtracted @xmath166 , @xmath167 and nn distributions and the total number of inclusive events in each @xmath188 interval . only the statistical errors of the data and monte carlo simulation are considered in the fit .",
    "the fit to the subtracted significance and nn distributions mainly constrains @xmath186 and @xmath187 , whereas the overall normalisation constrains @xmath185 .",
    "since the error on @xmath186 is much smaller than that of @xmath187 the @xmath59 cross section is measured in more @xmath113@xmath70 intervals than the @xmath60 cross section .",
    "therefore two sets of fits are performed , one with a fine binning of @xmath189 bins and the other with a coarse binning of @xmath190 bins .",
    "the two sets of fits are performed in an identical manner .",
    "the results of the two sets of fits are listed in tables  [ tab : rhotabledeffine ] and  [ tab : rhotabledefcoarse ] .",
    "also included in the tables are the @xmath191n.d.f .",
    "evaluated using statistical errors only .",
    "acceptable values are obtained for all bins .",
    "the fit is also performed to the complete data sample and shown in figure  [ fig : s1s2nnnegsub ] .",
    "the stability of the method is checked by repeating the fit to the complete data in a variety of ways : fitting the @xmath1 and @xmath0 data separately ; using @xmath168 instead of the nn ; using @xmath159 instead of the nn ; using the nn alone without @xmath166 and @xmath167 ; using @xmath166 and @xmath167 without the nn ; using the nn alone without negative subtraction .",
    "all give consistent results within statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the results of the fit in each @xmath113@xmath70 interval are converted to a measurement of the ` reduced @xmath59 cross section ' defined from the differential cross section as @xmath192    using : @xmath193 where @xmath146 is the fine structure constant evaluated with scale @xmath70 , and @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 are the number of light , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 quark events generated from the monte carlo simulation in each bin . the inclusive reduced cross section @xmath197 is taken from h1 measurements : tables  17 and 19 from @xcite , tables  10 and 11 from @xcite and table  11 from @xcite .",
    "a bin centre correction @xmath198 is applied using a nlo qcd expectation for @xmath199 and @xmath200 to convert the bin averaged measurement into a measurement at a given @xmath69@xmath70 point .",
    "this nlo qcd expectation is calculated from the results of a fit similar to that performed in  @xcite but using the massive scheme to generate heavy flavours .",
    "the reduced cross section is corrected using the monte carlo simulation for pure qed radiative effects .",
    "the photoproduction background is not subtracted , which , due to the method used to calculate the reduced cross sections , means that the fraction of @xmath59 and @xmath60 events in the photoproduction background is assumed to be the same as in the dis data . in most of the @xmath113 range",
