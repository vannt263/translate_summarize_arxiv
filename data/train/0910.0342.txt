    "the influence of projectile breakup in reactions with stable weakly bound nuclei on fusion cross section has been extensively investigated in the last decade and more recently for reactions involving exotic nuclei @xcite .",
    "the light particle spectra measured in ` singles ' mode display significant contributions from reaction mechanisms other than projectile breakup .",
    "this was for example shown very recently for @xmath5li + @xmath3co , which can be considered as a benchmark system  @xcite .",
    "therefore , coincidence measurements are of crucial importance to disentangling the respective contributions of the non - capture projectile breakup components ( both direct and sequential ) from other competing mechanisms such as incomplete fusion ( icf ) and/or transfer ( tr ) . the contributions of sequential projectile breakup ( sbu ) and direct projectile breakup ( dbu )",
    "are both significant and it is necessary to determine which process influences complete fusion ( cf ) most . in this case",
    ", the study of the breakup dynamics could provide decisive information .",
    "the @xmath5li beam was delivered by the 8  ud tandem accelerator at the the university of so paulo pelletron laboratory and bombarded a @xmath6  mg/@xmath7 @xmath3co target with an effective energy of @xmath8  mev .",
    "eleven triple telescopes ( ion chamber , a si surface barrier detector and a csi detector ) @xcite were used for the detection and identification of the light particles , positioned on both sides with respect to the beam direction with 10@xmath9 angular steps , covering angular intervals from @xmath10 to @xmath11 and @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "the study of @xmath0 particles and @xmath1 energy spectra for `` single '' mode events , performed in our previous work  @xcite , indicated a dominant contribution of icf / tr , more specifically @xmath1-incomplete fusion ( @xmath1-icf)/@xmath1-transfer ( @xmath1-tr ) for the case of @xmath0 spectra and @xmath0-incomplete fusion ( @xmath0-icf)/@xmath0-transfer ( @xmath0-tr ) for the @xmath1 spectra . in each case , the corresponding intermediate nucleus excitation energies were @xmath14  mev and @xmath15  mev for the @xmath16ni and @xmath17cu nuclei , respectively .    in this work , the contributions of the processes mentioned above , as well as the @xmath5li projectile breakup were identified for different angular regions selected by using the @xmath0-@xmath1 coincidence measurements together with a 3-body kinematics analysis .",
    "the behavior of the energy centroid of a broad structure present in the energy spectra was studied as a function of the angle . for angular differences within the @xmath5li breakup cone corresponding to the ( 2.186  mev , 3@xmath18 ) first resonant state , we observe two sharp peaks from the two possible kinematical solutions of the sbu and",
    "also a broad structure is observed between them .",
    "no other resonant state was observed in the data . for angular differences larger than the sbu cone , we observed only broad structures .",
    "these broad structures could be associated either with the decay of nuclei produced in icf / tr ( incomplete fusion and/or transfer ) or to @xmath5li dbu to the continuum .",
    "figure  [ fig : energies ] shown the @xmath1 energy @xmath19 as a function of @xmath20 for @xmath21 . in this case , if @xmath0-icf / tr is dominant , the @xmath1 energy @xmath19 should be constant , consistent with the @xmath15  mev excitation energy of the @xmath17cu intermediate nucleus ( dotted line ) . this behavior would be more evident for angles near the @xmath17cu recoil direction , for which we expect the maximum of cross section for the @xmath0-particle decay .",
    "this is indeed observed for angles near the recoiling @xmath17cu .",
    "for other negative angles we observe instead a trend consistent with a @xmath14  mev excitation energy for the @xmath16ni composite system ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "this suggests the dominance of the @xmath1-icf / tr process .",
    "therefore , both @xmath0-icf / tr and @xmath1-icf / tr contributions can be , in principle , mixed together . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "if @xmath5li direct breakup is dominant , the centroid of the broad structure would approximately correspond to the minimum allowed @xmath0-@xmath1 relative energy ( @xmath22 ) for each angular pair . this trend is observed in fig .  [",
    "fig : energies ] ( dashed line ) and suggests that the @xmath5li dbu dominates in the case of angular pairs for which the broad structure is observed with @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for these angular pairs ( i.e. for @xmath20 angle values ranging between @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) the experimental points shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energies ] correspond to the energies of the sbu peaks .",
    "the dynamics of the sbu and dbu processes were investigated using a semiclassical approach , as the one previously adopted in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the sommerfeld parameter ( @xmath26 ) is sufficient large and the relative energies of the breakup fragments are not too high , we can assume that the projectile , as well as the breakup fragments , follow a coulomb trajectory .",
    "figure  [ fig : angdistr ] depicts the experimental angular distribution for the sbu process analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as for the dbu . the angular distribution for the dbu is shown for @xmath5li continuum excitation energies summed between e@xmath27 = @xmath28 mev and e@xmath27 = @xmath29  mev .",
    "the dotted line was extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite and corresponds to the sbu cdcc calculation @xcite .",
    "the dashed line represents the dbu cdcc result @xcite for a @xmath5li excitation energy range from e@xmath27 = @xmath30  mev ( breakup threshold ) to e@xmath27 = @xmath29  mev .",
    "the curves presented in this figure were used to calculate the relative probability of particle production ( function @xmath31 ) for sbu and dbu processes as a function of the distance of closest approach @xmath32 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : functionf ] . in the same figure",
    "we also present the function @xmath31 for the other two dbu excitation energy ranges e@xmath27 = @xmath33 to @xmath34  mev and e@xmath27 = @xmath35 to @xmath36  mev not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angdistr ] . in the semiclassical calculations we assumed the most probable value of the excitation energy observed experimentally for each energy range ( @xmath37 and @xmath38  mev ) .          from fig .",
    "[ fig : functionf ] one can notice that the most probable value of @xmath32 are very similar for sbu and dbu .",
    "however , for the @xmath5li @xmath41 state with @xmath42  mev the sbu lifetime is @xmath43  s corresponding to @xmath44  mev @xcite , which is at least one order of magnitude greater than the ones observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetime ] for dbu .",
    "it indicates that sequential projectile breakup occurs very far from the target . on the other hand , for dbu the shorter lifetimes of the continuum ` states ' cause the breakup process to occur at shorter distances from the target .",
    "therefore , in reactions that have a large icf / tr cross section ( as refs .",
    "@xcite , for instance ) and a major influence on the complete fusion cross section , the flux diverted from cf to icf / tr would arise essentially from the dbu components ( higher excitation energies in the continuum ) .",
