    "recent work on the phenomenology of large @xmath2 gauge theories has revealed that theories based on ` moose diagrams ' ( aka ` quiver theories ' ) generate extra dimensions in the large quiver limit .",
    "explicitly , the lagrangian takes the form of a lattice field theory plus extra irrelevant matter that completes the theory in the uv .",
    "this so - called ` dimensional deconstruction'@xcite ( see also @xcite,@xcite ) has an elegant realization in string theory , where the quiver theories arise as the worldvolume theories of d - branes on geometric orbifolds .",
    "some rather clever moose phonomenology has led to novel presentations of several interesting systems , including the mysterious interacting @xmath3 @xmath1 and little string theories@xcite , hinting that there is more to be learned from this subtle regulation scheme .",
    "of course , there already exist methods for generating higher - dimensional branes , in particular matrix theory constructions@xcite which lead to non - commutative worldvolumes .",
    "what is the relation between these two approaches ? can one deconstruct noncommutative dimensions ?    in this note we present evidence that the worldvolume theories of d - branes probing @xmath4 orbifolds with discrete torsion provide , in the @xmath5 large - moose limit , precisely such a construction .",
    "the new non - commutative directions appear exactly as in the original case ; their non - commutativity derives directly from the extra phases specifying the discrete torsion .",
    "this can be motivated as follows .",
    "first , as we will explain in detail below , the partition function for closed strings on the torus @xmath6 with discrete torsion @xmath7 , @xmath8 , is identical to that on the same torus but with a constant background @xmath9-field such that @xmath10 .",
    "thus the theory of a d@xmath11-brane on a torus with discrete torsion @xmath12 is dual to the theory of a d@xmath13-brane wrapping the t - dual torus with a ( rescaled ) constant background @xmath14-field @xmath15 - which is exactly noncommutative sym on the same torus .    now consider the orbifold @xmath16 with discrete torsion @xmath12 .",
    "this is a cone over base @xmath17 ; for large @xmath2 this is a very sharp cone .",
    "consider a thin region of this cone far from the orbifold fixed point , where the geometry is approximately @xmath18 ; in the @xmath19 limit , the local physics precisely reproduces the toroidal orbifold with discrete torsion .",
    "this implies that the quiver theory of a d@xmath20-brane on @xmath16 with discrete torsion reproduces , in the large @xmath2 limit , the noncommutative theory of a d@xmath21-brane wrapping a torus with a constant background @xmath9-field specified by the discrete torsion .    in the following",
    "we explicitly verify this conjecture by demonstrating that this quiver theory is equivalent to sym on an @xmath22-point fuzzy torus with a noncommutativity parameter specified by the discrete torsion @xmath23 . ) , ( [ openvsclosed ] ) . ]",
    "( in this relationship we keep the closed string volume fixed . ) in the @xmath19 limit , this precisely reproduces sym on a smooth torus with constant @xmath9-field correctly specified by the discrete torsion . in the language of @xcite",
    ", this shows that the orbifold @xmath16 with discrete torsion can be used to `` deconstruct '' a wide class of noncommutative theories .",
    "in particular , one can use the @xmath16 orbifolds with discrete torsion to deconstruct noncommutative d@xmath20-brane theories for @xmath24 . for @xmath25",
    ", one can take a further strong coupling limit to obtain a deconstruction of ncos theory@xcite . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the d - brane sym theories are not uv complete ; it is a remarkable fact that the deconstructed theories appear to contain precisely the degrees of freedom required to complete the d - brane theories to @xmath1 @xcite or little string theories @xcite , respectively , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "we begin by reviewing the original ` deconstruction ' phenomenon@xcite .",
    "we then recall the quiver theories on branes probing orbifolds with discrete torsion and demonstrate how they deconstruct non - commutative theories .",
    "we compare the deconstruction of noncommutative d - branes to their matrix theory constructions , finding agreement in the large moose limit , and argue that finite moose provide stringy realizations of gauge theories on fuzzy tori .",
    "we close with further speculations and open questions .",
    "( for related earlier work , see eg @xcite . )",
    "consider the worldvolume theory of a single d0-brane on a supersymmetric @xmath27 orbifold .",
    "( a d3-brane probe of this orbifold was used in @xcite to deconstruct the six - dimensional ( 2,0 ) theory . )",
    "the orbifold can be thought of as a local model for an @xmath28 singularity in a k3 manifold , preserving half of the original supersymmetry .",
    "a general technique for constructing worldvolume theories of d - branes on orbifolds was described in a remarkable paper by douglas and moore @xcite ; we follow their procedure .    parameterizing the target space with five real scalars @xmath29 and two complex scalars @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the geometric action of the @xmath32 generator is @xmath33    the massless worldvolume fields of the parent @xmath34 @xmath35 gauge theory are gauge fields @xmath36 , scalars @xmath37 , and majorana - weyl spinors in the * 16 * of @xmath38 , @xmath39 . as in @xcite",
    ", we construct @xmath40 , a weyl spinor of @xmath41 , out of the components of @xmath42 having @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "similarly the weyl spinor @xmath45 will contain the components of @xmath42 with either @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "when acting on d - branes , the orbifold group may have an additional action on the chan - paton indices .",
    "the action of the generator @xmath48 of the @xmath32 orbifold group can thus be written @xmath49 where the @xmath50-matrices belong to a faithful representation of the orbifold group . in the case at hand",
    ", we can express @xmath51 in a convenient basis as @xmath52 the fields surviving the orbifold projection ( [ fullorbifoldaction ] ) are thus @xmath53 this spectrum can be conveniently represented by so called moose or quiver diagrams ( see fig .",
    "figure 1 : the @xmath54 moose . on",
    "the left is the moose for @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .    on the right",
    "is the moose for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .    the classical potential , descending from the potential of the parent theory by restricting to fields which survive the orbifold projection , includes the following term for every @xmath61 : @xmath62 there are also terms quartic in @xmath63 and @xmath64 forcing @xmath65 and @xmath66 to be independent of @xmath67 .",
    "the moduli space has a coulomb branch , where all @xmath68 and @xmath69 vanish and where @xmath70 can be independently varied .",
    "it also has a higgs branch with @xmath71 we have added a factor of @xmath72 to ( [ potentialforx ] ) so that the higgs expectation values ( [ higgsz1z2 ] ) correspond to moving a d0-brane ( consisting of @xmath2 fractional d0-branes ) to a distance @xmath73 from the orbifold point .",
    "the trick is now to study low energy fluctuations around a particular point on the higgs branch given by some fixed values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the leading order potential for @xmath76 , for example , will be @xmath77 for large @xmath2 and @xmath78 slowly varying with @xmath67 , this looks very much like a lattice discretization of @xmath79 with @xmath80 and effective lattice spacing @xmath81 .",
    "it is a stimulating and life - affirming exercise to check that the rest of the lagrangian takes the correct form to reproduce , in the continuum limit , the worldvolume theory of a d1-brane .",
    "there is a simple geometric reason that this works . for large @xmath2",
    "the orbifold is a sharp cone over base @xmath82 . for large @xmath83 ,",
    "far from the fixed locus , the local geometry seen by the d0-brane is approximately a cylinder of radius @xmath84 , with the compact coordinate being in the @xmath85 direction @xcite .",
    "t - duality along this coordinate ( which is valid far from the fixed locus ) produces a d1-brane wrapping an @xmath86 of radius @xmath87 and string coupling @xmath88 with these values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the factor in front of the integral in ( [ potentialforcontinuousx ] ) becomes precisely the d1-brane tension @xmath91 it is simple and remarkable to check that the interaction terms in the d1-brane world - volume theory thus obtained are correctly normalized .",
    "we can of course t - dualize without approximating the geometry by a cylinder @xcite .",
    "the t - dual of the full orbifold geometry involves @xmath2 ns5-branes evenly spaced along the t - dual circle , while the fractional d0-branes at the orbifold point become d - strings stretched between the ns5-branes .",
    "it is easy to find similar quiver theories which mock up higher dimensional d - branes at energies lower than @xmath92 ( alternatively , whose ir physics in the limit of @xmath93 reproduces a higher - dimensional d - brane worldvolume theory ) . in supersymmetric cases ,",
    "the number of supercharges is increased in this limit , because an orbifold generally breaks some supersymmetry , whereas a torus with periodic boundary conditions does not . in our example , the number of supercharges is doubled , giving 16 real supercharges in the end .",
    "the scalings of the various couplings also deserve attention .",
    "consider for concreteness the deconstruction of @xmath94 @xmath95 theory with small but finite coupling @xmath96 .",
    "this proceeds as above by studying light fluctuations off the higgs branch of the cyclic moose , similar to @xcite .",
    "let @xmath97 be the gauge coupling in the original @xmath98 quiver theory .",
    "out along the higgs branch , the effective coupling of the surviving @xmath95 gauge theory is @xmath99 the relation between the @xmath94 and @xmath100 couplings is as usual for kaluza - klein reduction , @xmath101 expressed in terms of the coupling in the original quiver theory , the @xmath94 coupling is thus @xmath102 so holding the @xmath94 coupling and ( emergent ) radius @xmath89 fixed and finite while taking @xmath19 gives finite @xmath103 but requires taking the original coupling of the higgsed moose large , @xmath104 the upshot is that , while the gauge coupling of the original quiver theory is getting large , the gauge couplings of both the @xmath105 d@xmath20-branes far form the orbifold fixed point and of the deconstructed d@xmath21-branes can be kept arbitrarily weak .",
    "more generally , consider the deconstruction of a @xmath106 dimensional theory with small but finite t hooft coupling @xmath107 . in terms of the effective lattice spacing @xmath108 and quiver coupling @xmath97 ,",
    "@xmath109 the ( very strongly higgsed ! )",
    "original quiver theory is thus strongly coupled in the continuum limit @xmath110 . on the other hand , for @xmath2 large but fixed energy scale comparable to @xmath111 in the deconstructed theory",
    ", these configurations have extremely large higgs expectation values @xmath112 , with the result that the low - energy excitations are not localized in the moose but spread over many gauge groups .",
    "this makes the effective interactions small , so the dynamics can be studied perturbatively , which is the statement that the effective @xmath113-dimensional t hooft coupling @xmath114 can be held weak in the continuum limit .",
    "second , the matrix hamiltonian , which gives for example ( [ potentialforx ] ) , is usually said to be valid only for small separations between the d - branes .",
    "naively , one might worry that ( [ potentialforx ] ) becomes inapplicable when @xmath83 approaches the string length @xmath115 .",
    "however , as was discussed in e.g. @xcite , the true limitation is to energies lower than the string scale , i.e. to strings shorter than @xmath115 .",
    "this requires @xmath116 so that the model will be rich enough to accurately describe the physics .",
    "this bound ( [ stinglengthinequality ] ) translates to requiring the lattice spacing @xmath108 to be _ larger _ than the string length , @xmath117 happily , this is not an obstacle , as we are interested in the decoupling limit , i.e. in the physics at energies much lower than @xmath118 .",
    "finally , let s review some of the salient properties of the @xmath119 orbifold _ without _ discrete torsion .",
    "( this orbifold was used to deconstruct ( 1,1 ) little string theory in @xcite . )",
    "choosing three real transverse coordinates @xmath120 and three complex coordinates @xmath121 the geometric action of the two orbifold group generators is @xmath122 preserving one quarter of the original supersymmetry .",
    "the field content corresponding to @xmath105 transverse type ii d@xmath20-branes ( @xmath123 ) descends from a configuration of @xmath124 d@xmath20-branes in the parent theory ; a judicious choice of basis gives the action on gauge indices as @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the surviving spectrum is summarized by the quiver diagram on fig .",
    "2 .    figure 2 : @xmath16 moose for bifundamental scalars .",
    "note that it is periodic .    in @xmath100 @xmath128 language , @xmath129 bifundamental chiral superfields survive , plus adjoints from vector multiplets for each of the @xmath22 @xmath95 gauge groups .",
    "( of course , if @xmath130 , we have to dimensionally reduce these fields . )    giving identical vevs to all ` horizontal ' and ` vertical ' bifundamentals in the quiver diagram generates two discretized dimensions forming a rectangular torus .",
    "giving a further vev to the ` diagonal ' bifundamentals gives instead a slanted torus . in both cases ,",
    "the resulting low energy theory can be thought of as a latticized version of the worldvolume theory of @xmath105 wrapped d(@xmath131)-branes .",
    "( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "as we have seen , d@xmath20-branes on @xmath132 orbifolds deconstruct d@xmath21-branes .",
    "we will argue that discrete torsion makes the two new world - volume coordinates non - commutative in an appropriate continuum limit .",
    "we begin with a review of quiver theories on d - branes probing orbifolds with discrete torsion , discuss the basic strategy , and proceed with an explicit example .",
    "first let us review the physical meaning of discrete torsion , relate it to a t - dual @xmath9-field , and give an overview of the logical structure of our construction .",
    "orbifolds with discrete torsion @xcite generalize geometric orbifolds by adding to the twisted sectors of the path integral phases which depend on the orbifold group elements defining that sector .",
    "modular invariance forces the discrete torsion to lie in @xmath133 , i.e. the torsion is a two - cocycle of the orbifold group .",
    "a trivial example is the torus , @xmath134 , whose partition function is a sum over winding @xmath135 twisted sectors @xmath136 adding discrete torsion ammounts to adding phases of the form @xmath137 importantly , this is identical to the partition function for the torus with a constant background longitudinal @xmath9-field with @xmath138 , so the torus with discrete torsion is identical to the torus with constant background @xmath9-field .",
    "this fits with the fact that the @xmath9-field takes values in @xmath139 .",
    "let s consider the @xmath16 orbifold with discrete torsion @xmath140 labeled by the integer @xmath141 ( mod @xmath2 ) in @xmath142 for @xmath2 large , this is a sharp cone over base @xmath17 , which in particular contains a @xmath143 factor . by taking @xmath19 ( and @xmath144",
    "fixed ) while moving away from the orbifold fixed point so as to keep the volume of the torus fixed , we recover the background @xmath145 , where the twisted sectors of the orbifold become the winding sectors on the torus , so the discrete torsion of the orbifold becomes discrete torsion on the torus .    now probe the @xmath16 torsion orbifold with a d@xmath11-brane far from the fixed point and again consider the constant volume , large @xmath2 limit .",
    "from the above , this limit is identical to the theory of a d@xmath11-brane on the same torus in the presence of a background @xmath9-field .",
    "t - dualizing both legs of the torus gives a d@xmath13-brane wrapping the dual torus with a rescaled background @xmath9-field , whose worldvolume theory is sym on a noncommutative torus with noncommutativity given by @xmath146 .",
    "thus we can realize noncommutative sym as the large-@xmath2 limit of the quiver theory of a d - brane on a @xmath16 orbifold with discrete torsion .",
    "detailed study of this quiver theory reveals that , in this limit , the theory becomes precisely sym on an @xmath22-point fuzzy torus , with noncommutativity given in terms of the volume of the torus and the discrete torsion .",
    "but the large @xmath2 limit of this fuzzy sym is exactly sym on a noncommutative torus .",
    "thus the quiver theory of a d@xmath20-brane probing a @xmath16 with discrete torsion precisely deconstructs the worldvolume theory of a d@xmath21-brane wrapping a noncommutative torus .",
    "this can be expressed in the commuting diagram ( figure 3 )    = 0.8    figure 3 : deconstruction is t - duality .",
    "note that @xmath147 .",
    "the scalings indicated are for fixed volume of the torus seen by closed strings .",
    "this provides a simple and useful physical interpretation of discrete torsion . since the possibility of including discrete torsion depends on the non - vanishing of @xmath148 , having discrete torsion means that the orbifold can be presented as a fibration whose fibres contain 2-cycles .",
    "the interpretation suggested by our analysis is that the discrete torsion should be understood as the @xmath9-field along ( the t - dual of ) each fibre .",
    "the utility of this interpretation is that it applies just as well in the case of orbifolds with fixed points ( at which points the fibration becomes singular ) , where fractional branes can wrap the shrunken cycle , as to orbifolds with freely acting orbifold groups ( non - singular fibrations ) , such as @xmath149 , where there is no shrunken cycle to wrap .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we explicitly verify the above story for @xmath16 .      as explained in @xcite , chan - paton indices in the worldvolume theories of d - branes probing orbifolds with discrete torsion transform in projective representations of the orbifold group , @xmath150 , where the phase @xmath151 again lies in @xmath133 . in the following we focus on the orbifold group @xmath152 , for which @xmath153 , so the choice of discrete torsion is specified by one number , @xmath154 . for @xmath2 and @xmath154 relatively prime ( which we will assume throughout for simplicity ) , there is a unique irreducible projective representation of the orbifold group , which can be realized as @xmath155 matrices involving the usual clock and shift operators . to get a representation describing @xmath105 d@xmath20-branes on the orbifold , we tensor this irreducible representation with @xmath156 matrices .",
    "we emphasize that this phenomenon works for general @xmath9-fields . to motivate this , consider deconstruction of a general manifold @xmath157 via an orbifold with quantum symmetry @xmath158 such that @xmath159 in the continuum limit .",
    "the discrete torsion is classified by @xmath160 ; in the continuum limit this becomes @xmath161 , which classifies the @xmath9-field along the emergent dimensions .",
    "the physics of d - branes in the supersymmetric @xmath119 orbifold with discrete torsion was described in @xcite .",

    "more precisely , recall that there is an infinite number of possible descriptions of non - commutative theories @xcite , differing by the choice of the two - form @xmath252 ( not to be confused with the chiral superfields @xmath253 ) appearing in the commutation relations @xmath254 = i \\theta^{\\ \\ ! \\ ! \\tilde i \\tilde j } , \\quad   [ \\partial_{\\tilde i } , x^{\\tilde j } ] = i \\delta_{\\tilde i}^{\\tilde   j } , \\quad [ \\partial_{\\tilde i } , \\partial_{\\tilde j } ] = -i \\phi'_{\\tilde",
    "i \\tilde j } \\quad ( \\tilde i , \\tilde j = \\tilde 1 , \\tilde 2)\\ ] ] as explained in @xcite , the choice which matrix theory naturally selects is @xmath255 ( this applies also to the fuzzy moose theory . ) for this value of @xmath256 , the relation between open and closed string parameters is @xmath257 @xmath258 and @xmath259 are the open string metric and coupling , respectively , while @xmath260 and @xmath190 denote their closed string counterparts . here",
    "we condense notation , manipulating matrices as if they had only indices @xmath261 and @xmath262 and suppressing other components . using the continuum results of @xcite in a frame where @xmath263 we can express the @xmath9-field along the brane as @xcite @xmath264 where @xmath265 is the volume of the torus as seen by closed strings . the open string metric ( from [ openvsclosed ] ) is @xmath266 giving the volume seen by open strings @xmath267 the corresponding gauge coupling is @xmath268 where we have used @xmath269 , as identified in the previous section .",
    "these are exactly the results given by the fuzzy moose , provided we set @xmath270 in choosing the discrete torsion . at first sight",
    "this is somewhat disconcerting ; why does the moose have this extra parameter that does not appear in the strictly infinite-@xmath2 matrix theory , and what does it mean physically , anyway ? are the fuzzy moose with different @xmath154 really different theories ?",
    "the resolution comes from morita equivalence in the non - commutative theory , which derives from t - duality in the original theory .",
    "as promulgated by seiberg and witten @xcite , morita equivalence relates a noncommutative theory on a flat torus with metric @xmath258 , gauge coupling @xmath271 and rational theta parameter @xmath272 to a commutative theory with parameters @xmath273 as the rescalings of the metric and gauge coupling do not depend on @xmath154 , the fuzzy moose with the different @xmath154 we consider are all morita equivalent to the same commutative theory on the same torus with the same coupling , and thus equivalent to each other .",
    "this equivalence must be read with a bit of care . for finite @xmath2 ,",
    "t - duality on the orbifold is more subtle than on the cylinder ( in particular , since winding is conserved only @xmath274 @xmath2 , the dual momenum is conserved only @xmath274 @xmath2 ) , so the morita equivalence may be only approximate .",
    "this in fact seems necessary , since the orbifold theories with discrete torsion for any finite @xmath2 and different @xmath154 ( again all relatively prime ) appear manifestly different - the surviving @xmath32 quantum symmetry groups are embedded differently in the @xmath132 , and the quiver theory superpotentials contain different phases .",
    "it is only in the strict large @xmath2 limit that this naive t - duality is exact and the theories become truly identical .",
    "happily , it is precisely in this limit that we compare to the strictly infinite-@xmath2 matrix theory construction @xcite , which has no such parameter in the first place .",
    "this remarkable agreement provides further evidence that the fuzzy moose agrees with matrix theory in the large @xmath2 limit . that they disagree slightly at finite @xmath2",
    "again should not be worrying : for finite @xmath2 , the matrix theory background does not solve the f - term constraints and is thus not stable , while the moose theory is .",
    "physically , the two presentations are essentially two different regularizations of the noncommutative theory which need agree only in the deregulated limit - which they do .",
    "we have presented considerable evidence that quiver theories living on d - branes probing orbifolds with discrete torsion deconstruct higher - dimensional non - commutative theories in the large - moose limit .",
    "the lagrangian of the moose theory far along its higgs branch reproduces , for large moose , the lagrangian ( [ f - term ] ) , ( [ plaquette ] ) for the fuzzy torus . in the strict large moose limit",
    "this becomes a gauge theory on a noncomutative torus .",
    "the fuzzy moose agrees with the matrix theory construction in the strict large @xmath2 limit .",
    "it is remarkable that the fuzzy moose is completely well defined for all @xmath2 , providing a novel and consistent regularization of noncommutative theories and an explicit realization in string theory of gauge theory on a fuzzy torus .",
    "this begs the question of how the fuzzy moose encodes the uv / ir correspondence of the continuum non - commutative theory .",
    "for example , non - susy fuzzy moose theories should deconstruct non - susy noncommutative theories , in which we expect ir poles in physical processes arising from uv degrees of freedom @xcite ; how are these divergences regulated in the fuzzy moose theory ?",
    "this should be a fruitful ground for exploration .",
    "one immediate extension of our construction is to note that since the strong coupling limit of @xmath275 sym is ncos theory , taking the strong coupling limit of the fuzzy moose d@xmath276-branes should provide an explicit deconstruction of ncos theory .",
    "it is also tempting to speculate about theories one might ( de)construct from more baroque orbifold geometries . along these lines , it seems that similar arguments might be used in orbifolds of the conifold with discrete torsion , which have been studied extensively in @xcite .",
    "additionally , while the fuzzy moose on d@xmath13- or d@xmath277-branes naively deconstructs noncommutative @xmath278- and @xmath279-brane theories , arguments similar to those in @xcite suggest that they should actually deconstruct some uv completion of these theories , namely some generalization of @xmath1 and little string theories , or perhaps even some more general 5-brane theory with a 3-form generalization of non - commutativity .",
