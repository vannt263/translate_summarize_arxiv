    "microscopic approaches based on the self - consistent mean field theory and its extensions are among the most powerful methods of describing many - body interacting systems .",
    "these approaches have been used for many years in nuclear physics  @xcite as well as in atomic and molecular physics  @xcite . in nuclear physics , they are usually based on energy density functionals built from phenomenological parameterizations of the nucleon - nucleon effective interaction as the skyrme forces @xcite or the gogny interaction  @xcite .    in nuclei away from closed shells , pairing correlations are known to play a very important role .",
    "the techniques commonly used to describe them in a microscopic framework are the hartree - fock ( hf ) + bcs and hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approaches .",
    "whereas these approaches have proved to provide an excellent description of observables associated with pairing such as gaps or odd - even mass differences in superfluid nuclei , they suffer from the defect that pairing correlations are introduced by means of a  the bcs  that does not represent a definite number of nucleons . as a consequence ,",
    "strongly paired nuclear states contain spurious nucleon number fluctuations that may be large .",
    "in addition , part of the correlations induced by the nuclear pairing interaction is not described in weakly correlated regimes  @xcite .",
    "this problem , which arises from the particular form of the bcs , has led to a revival of the study of pairing correlations in atomic nuclei in the last five years .",
    "namely , methods have been implemented by several groups based on particle number projected bcs s  @xcite . whereas projection of the self - consistent hfb or bcs s  the projection after variation ( pav ) technique  allows one to restore nucleon numbers and to compute the corresponding correction to the total binding energy , only the variation after projection ( vap ) procedure , either in the form of the approximate lipkin - nogami technique or using the exact formalism is able to describe correlations in situations where bcs or hfb pairing is small .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the two kinds of approach lead to significant differences in the correlation content of projected wave - functions .",
    "in this work , we envisage an alternative to these projection methods by applying a variational multiparticle - multihole ( mp - mh ) configuration mixing technique .",
    "this approach is similar to the multiconfiguration hartree - fock method ( mchf )  @xcite well - known in atomic physics or to the multiconfiguration self - consistent field method ( mcscf )  @xcite employed in molecular physics , and it can be used to describe not only pairing correlations but also other kinds of long range correlations such as those associated with collective vibrations .",
    "the  of the system is assumed to be a superposition of a finite set of slater determinants which includes a hf - type state together with multiple particle - hole ( ph ) excitations of this state .",
    "both the configuration mixing coefficients and the single - particle states are determined in a self - consistent way from a variational procedure .",
    "let us emphasize that , contrary to the s used in the large scale shell model approach  @xcite , ph excitations are not restricted to those within one major shell .",
    "they are built from the full ( finite ) single - particle spectrum obtained in the hf - like calculation .",
    "on the other hand , only excited configurations involving a relatively small number of ph excitations have to be taken into account .",
    "this is due to the fact that single - particle states are derived from a self - consistent mean - field that already contains a large part of the effect of two - body interactions .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that pairing correlations in usual superfluid nuclei can be accurately described using excitations involving the excitation of no more than three conjugate pairs of like nucleons .",
    "one important advantage of such an approach is to describe correlations in a formalism that explicitly preserve particle number conservation and never violates the pauli principle ( contrary to e.g. random phase approximation ( rpa ) correlations ) . in the case of pairing , as will be seen in section [ formalism ] , the mp - mh method is more general than the fully vap procedure .",
    "it is therefore in position to describe both strong pairing correlations without particle number violation as well as the particular correlations occuring in weakly paired systems .",
    "pioneering work along this line have been developed in nuclear physics using an approach referred to as higher tamm - dancoff approximation ( htda )  @xcite . in this kind of approach , the nuclear mean - field which provides the single - particle states",
    "is derived from an energy density functional built with an effective force of the skyrme family , and correlations are generated by means of a simplified phenomenological residual interaction in the form of a contact two - body force .",
    "this method has been used to describe the behaviour of nuclei as a function of quadrupole deformation and the properties of long - lived nuclear states such as isomeric states in @xmath4hf nucleus .",
    "extensions of this work , where the residual interaction is treated in a perturbative way , in the spirit of highly truncated shell model , can be found in ref .",
    "an attempt in this direction was previously proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us also mention a similar approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to describe pairing correlations in a fully particle - number conserving way .    in the present mp - mh configuration",
    "mixing approach , the ground state and first excited states are derived variationally from an energy density functional taken as the mean - value within the mp - mh of the effective hamiltonian built with the gogny force .",
    "calculations are performed using an axially - symetric representation of single particle states .",
    "the density distribution entering the density - dependent term of the gogny force has been taken as the one built from the correlated mp - mh .",
    "this prescription has been adopted in the vap onto particle number procedure @xcite , in the context of the projected hfb approach .",
    "although there is no justification for using this correlated density distribution in the effective force , such a choice has been made in order to naturally obtain in the variational procedure the so - called rearrangement terms that are known to play a crucial role in the matrix elements of the mean - field  @xcite and also of the residual interaction .",
    "the importance of including such rearrangement terms is clearly exposed and illustrated in refs.@xcite in the context of rpa and qrpa methods .",
    "let us mention that the use of a unique effective two - body interaction for deriving in a unified way both the single - particle structure associated with the nuclear mean - field and the correlations beyond the mean - field is clearly an advantage in the context of a completely microscopic description of nuclear states .",
    "it reduces the phenomenological part of the present nuclear structure approach as the only parameters are those of the nucleon - nucleon effective interaction .    in the present work , we will only study correlations of pairing - type , leaving for further work other kinds of correlations .",
    "the mp - mh trial  will therefore be restricted to a superposition of configurations taken as bcs - type pair excitations . here , a bcs - type pair is defined as two protons or two neutrons in time - reversed states . by making this choice , only the usual pairing part of the residual interaction ",
    "the singlet even component  is taken into account in the description of correlations .",
    "in particular , proton - neutron pairing - type correlations are not taken into account in the present study .",
    "the aim of the present work is to analyze pairing - type correlations in nuclei in three different situations : large bcs pairing , medium bcs pairing and no bcs pairing by analyzing three well - known nuclei : @xmath5sn , @xmath6sn and @xmath7sn .",
    "the quantities that will be examined are the total correlation energy , the structure of the correlated ground state wave - function , in particular the respective weights of the hf - type wave - function and of the different mp - mh pair excitations , and the influence of correlations on single - particle energies and occupation probabilities .",
    "comparisons will be made with usual hfb results derived from the same gogny two - body effective interaction and also with those of projection methods such as pbcs after variation .",
    "nuclear radii and the energy and structure of the first theoretical excited @xmath3 state will be compared with experimental data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the variational mp - mh configuration mixing method together with its restriction to the case of pairing correlations .",
    "results obtained for pairing - type correlations in @xmath5sn , @xmath6sn and @xmath7sn are presented and discussed in section iii .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "in this part , we present the derivation of the variational mp - mh configuration mixing method applied to the ground state description of even - even nuclei . we have considered pertinent to detail it here first as this approach is not commonly used in nuclear physics , contrary to atomic and molecular physics . moreover , some features of the method are specific to nuclear physics , such as the existence of two kinds of particles and the occurence of rearrangement terms coming from the density - dependence of the phenomenological effective nucleon - nucleon interaction .    the variational mp - mh configuration mixing method is a self - consistent approach that generalizes the usual density - dependent hartree - fock ( ddhf ) approach  @xcite in order to take into account various types of nuclear correlations beyond the mean field in an unified way .",

    "the indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 stand for proton and neutron , respectively .",

    "it must be emphasized that the mp - mh configuration mixing method does not make use of an inert core .",
    "this is an important feature of the method because the matrix elements that couple occupied deep single - particle states in @xmath90 with high - lying unoccupied ones are not negligible .",
    "for instance , taking the fourier transform of the central part of the gogny force shows that occupied single particle states can couple to unoccupied states up to 80 mev excitation energy .",
    "in fact these matrix elements are expected to contribute significantly to the renormalization of the single - particle states due to correlations .",
