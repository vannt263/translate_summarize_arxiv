    "much effort has been spent attempting to elucidate the epoch of reionization ( eor ) @xcite , when the matter in the universe , dominated by hydrogen gas , transformed from the neutral state to an ionized state . considering",
    "this phase transition is most likely a product of the first population of stars , probing this epoch opens a window into star formation and large - scale structure ( lss ) in the early universe .",
    "many questions concerning this epoch remain unanswered , including the nature of the first stars and when reionization occurred , although evidence from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) @xcite has suggested that reionization began around redshift @xmath5 and was completed around @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this picture is also consistent with the recently released planck observations @xcite .",
    "we also see further evidence of ly@xmath0 absorption by neutral hydrogen at high redshifts from the detection of gunn - peterson troughs in quasar spectra @xcite and damped ly@xmath0 systems @xcite .",
    "the characterization of fluctuations in the near - infrared background ( nirb ) due to continuum emission of early stars during the reionization epoch has been attempted @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations cominate over low - redshift galaxies and appear to exhibit a rayleigh - jeans spectrum @xcite .",
    "@xcite claims the fluctuations are from the eor while @xcite claims the fluctuations are from diffuse intrahalo light ( ihl ) .",
    "both possibilities would have significant implications for future ly@xmath0 studies , especially since ihl would be a serious foreground to ly@xmath0 clustering .",
    "in addition , continuum emission can not be used to map the tomography of reionization sources because emission at various redshifts combine in intensity maps in each frequency band .    to answer questions regarding the nature of the eor and star formation",
    ", line emission provides essential redshift information .",
    "intensity mapping has arisen as a potentially powerful probe of lss and star formation at high redshifts .",
    "unlike spectroscopic surveys , which use catalogs of objects detected individually , an intensity map captures the aggregated light from an emission line in large pixels across the sky , including emission from unresolved sources .",
    "various lines have been proposed as potential candidates for intensity mapping , including hi @xcite , co , cii @xcite , and ly@xmath0 @xcite . in this study",
    "we focus on ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "ly@xmath0 photons emitted during the eor with rest - frame wavelength 1216 will redshift to the near - infrared regime today , making them potentially detectable by narrow - band infrared detectors .",
    "zodiacal light emission makes detecting the absolute photometry in the infrared problematic ; however , we can circumvent this issue by mapping the spatial fluctuations in the ly@xmath0 line emission on small scales where the zodiacal light is spatially smooth .",
    "previous work by @xcite described the ly@xmath0 intensity mapping signal for during the eor , specifically redshifts @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "we extend their work by filling in the post - reionization epoch , all the way down to @xmath8 , considering that many telescopes [ e.g. hyper suprime cam ( hsc ) , the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) ] , may seek to measure the low - redshift signal in order to constrain cosmological parameters as well as star formation .",
    "ly@xmath0 emission in the eor and post - eor comes from both massive , dark - matter halos containing ionizing stellar populations and from the surrounding igm .",
    "the emission in the halos is predicted to be sourced mainly by pop - iii and pop - ii stars that emit ionizing photons which ionize neutral hydrogen , which then emits ly@xmath0 photons upon recombination .",
    "these stellar populations can also source emission in the igm through @xmath9-@xmath10 recombinations and @xmath9-hi collisions .",
    "in addition , diffuse igm emission should be sourced by @xmath9-@xmath10 recombinations in the igm , as well as photons from continuum emission from higher - redshift stars , which are then redshifted , absorbed , and re - emitted at ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "the relative contributions of the halos and stellar igm are partly determined by @xmath11 , the star formation efficiency , @xmath12 , the escape fraction of ionizing photons from the halos to the igm , the gas temperature , and @xmath13 , the minimum mass of ly@xmath0 halos , while the diffuse igm emission from continuum stars depends on @xmath11 , the stellar spectrum , and the ionization history .    in this paper , we model the theoretical intensity signal of the ly@xmath0 line over cosmic history , specifically over redshifts @xmath8 to 12 .",
    "we also construct an empirical estimate of the ly@xmath0 intensity out to @xmath14 based on measurements of the ly@xmath0 luminosity function at various redshifts .",
    "we find that although the empirical estimate is slightly lower than theoretical estimates from ly@xmath0 emitters for the intensity , these estimates do agree to within an order of magnitude .",
    "we find that for ly@xmath0 emitters , the emission from massive halos dominates the signal at all redshifts considered ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "however , the emission components from the diffuse igm dominate the intensity over all the other sources , except at high redshifts ( @xmath16 ) where ly@xmath0 emitters dominate again .    using these estimates of the intensity",
    ", we calculate the 3d power spectrum of ly@xmath0 line emission from fluctuations in the halos and the igm , implementing a halo - model formalism for the clustering bias . as with the intensity ,",
    "diffuse igm emission dominates the signal for most of our redshift range , meaning cross - correlations with other emission lines will be required to detect the ly@xmath0-emitter signal .",
    "note that these estimates do not include fluctuations in the ionization fraction , which may increase the signal for all the igm - related sources above our estimates .",
    "we also study prospects for measuring the ly@xmath0 power spectrum .",
    "we consider an intensity mapper with reasonable specifications for measuring ly@xmath0 fluctuations over the redshift range @xmath17 for a 200 deg@xmath18 survey , and find that ly@xmath0 emission should be detectable for tomography at late and post - reionization epochs ( @xmath19 ) , but fluctuations during earlier times during reionization are too low in our fiducial model for detection , except possibly for an extremely deep survey .",
    "we then estimate foreground emission that will contaminate the signal .",
    "we find that line emission foregrounds such as h@xmath0 emission lines that contaminate ly@xmath0 maps from redshifts @xmath20 can be masked to reveal the ly@xmath0 power spectrum , but this gets increasingly difficult for higher redshifts .",

    "we begin by constructing an empirical estimate of the ly@xmath0 intensity based on luminosity function ( lf ) measurements of ly@xmath0 emitters out to redshift @xmath23 .",

    "after a little algebra , we can write the intensity as @xmath30 where @xmath31 .    the luminosity density @xmath29 can be determined directly from the measured lf at redshift @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , the luminosity function @xmath33 , being the number density of emitters per luminosity bin , can produce a luminosity density by integrating @xmath33 over @xmath34 .",

    "if the shot noise is removed , only the clustering signal from redshifts @xmath62 could possibly be detected , although this is an underestimate since nonlinear clustering effects were neglected .",
    "it also appears the fluctuations at @xmath62 from just the ly@xmath0 emitters can also be detected , possibly through a cross - correlation with another lss tracer .",
    "but most of the ly@xmath0 emitter signal is from shot noise which becomes undetectable when objects with masses detectable by jwst are removed .",
    "also , while the fluctuations deeper within reionization can be detected over the entire band 2 with @xmath63 , a tomography study in the reionization region is beyond reach for @xmath64 . at redshifts @xmath65 ,",

    "increasing the sensitivity by a factor of 3 would allow fluctuations from @xmath66 to be detected , but without incredibly long integration times , this is well beyond these specifications .",
    "one solution may be to do a very deep survey over 20 deg@xmath18 . in this case , keeping the total survey integration time constant , the snr in the second band increases to 95 , which can provide much better tomography .",
    "the prospects do improve in the mid- to high - redshift range if diffuse igm emission due to recombinations plays a role , but this is highly speculative .",
    "changes in the various model parameters ( e.g. @xmath13 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) can change this picture somewhat .",

    "we neglect contributions from stars with @xmath82 because in this calculation we assume we can cull these by hand .",
    "we find that at lower ly@xmath0 redshifts , our fiducial power spectrum is greater than the continuum emission power spectrum .",
    "however , at redshifts within the eor ( @xmath83 ) , the continuum clearly dominates over our ly@xmath0 power spectrum .",
    "it will still be necessary to remove the effects of line emission from foreground galaxies that masquerade as ly@xmath0 emission . in this section",
    "we assess the method of masking contaminated pixels from the survey to isolate ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "oii ( 3727 ) and h@xmath0 ( 6563 ) lines from lower redshifts will be the dominant line interlopers for ly@xmath0 emission for redshifts @xmath84 .",
    "various methods can be used to identify these interlopers and mask their corresponding pixels , including secondary line identification , photometry , and cross - correlation with templates .",
    "these methods depend on the flux of the interloping line , in that the line must be well above a detection threshold in order to be identified .",
    "since it is impossible to mask all residual interloper emission , it is necessary to mask interlopers down to a tolerable residual flux such that its power spectrum is subdominant to that of ly@xmath0 .",
    "using spectroscopy to identify interlopers over a large area is too time - intensive , so useful method would be to use photometric redshifts from large - area imaging survey like _",
    "euclid_. both instruments will have photometric redshift precisions of @xmath85 , allowing only the relevant populations of interlopers at the right redshifts to be masked , limiting the amount of survey area lost to masking .",
    "one way to assess how much the flux of an interloper is decreasing as the map is being masked is a cross - correlation with another line ( not ly@xmath0 ) .",
    "this can not substitute for identifying interlopers directly for masking because the correlation between different emission line galaxy populations is not perfect enough for cleaning , but it is useful as a second check . for @xmath86",
    "m , we expect the intensity maps for ly@xmath0 to be dominated by h@xmath0 and oii emission .",

    "are masked , the ly@xmath0 emission will begin to dominate the signal .",
    "considering that the auto - correlation of h@xmath0 should be proportional to this cross - correlation , we can use the cross - correlation as a proxy for the amount of residual h@xmath0 remaining in the ly@xmath0 map .",
    "we focus on the h@xmath0 line because it dominates the signal over the spectral range of our hypothetical instrument ( see sec .",
    "[ s : instrum ] ) .",
    "however , this method can only be applied for @xmath88 m because at lower wavelengths oii lines with the same redshift at h@xmath0 lines do not appear in our spectral range . however ,",
    "this could be mitigated by adding a lower - wavelength band or partially by cross - correlating with a line higher than oii ( _ i.e _ , h@xmath89 ) .",
    "we estimate the difficulty of removing these interlopers by calculating the 3d power spectra of interloping h@xmath0 and oii lines and comparing these to the ly@xmath0 emission power spectrum .",
    "we determine the interloper intensities empirically using luminosity functions , specifically the h@xmath0 luminosity function from @xcite and the oii luminosity function from @xcite , we extrapolate it down to @xmath90 as a rough estimate for our analysis . ] . using the luminosity function , we find the unresolved luminosity density from luminosities between zero and a limiting luminosity , which can then give us the intensity , similar to eq .",

    "we also include wavevector translation effects in the interloper power spectrum since the contribution of interlopers to the number density of sources will be counted per 3d pixels at the ly@xmath0 redshift , not the interloper redshift .",
    "to account for small scales translating to larger scales , we include nonlinear clustering in the power spectrum according to the halo model @xcite .",
