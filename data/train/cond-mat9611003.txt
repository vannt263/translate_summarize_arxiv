    ", we construct a poincare map that turns the kronig - penney model into an equivalent tight - binding model and study the latter through a two - dimensional map corresponding to a classical linear oscillator with a parametric perturbation given in the form of periodic delta - kicks @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes of these kicks are defined by the site potential of the tight - binding model . in this representation , extended states of the tight - binding model are represented through bounded trajectories in the phase space of the hamiltonian map .",
    "furthermore , in this representation the two probe conductance is related to the time evolution ( under the hamiltonian map ) of areas initially defined by the basis unit vectors .",
    "this new approach provides an effective and simple tool for understanding transport properties , the structure of eigenstates as well as for deriving analytical expressions .",
    "in particular , one can easily determine fully transparent states for the general case when @xmath0 -sites are correlated . in the following section we summarize briefly the hamiltonian map approach used in ref .",

    "one should note that since @xmath38 is a @xmath39periodic function and takes values in @xmath40 , we have an infinite set of critical energies @xmath41 ( two in every interval @xmath42 $ ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , for the first allowed band defined through the condition @xmath43 , the disorder strength @xmath44 must be greater than a critical value @xmath45 in order to have resonant states .",
    "the critical disorder for reflectionless modes to appear , arises only in the first band of the spectrum .",
    "the previous analysis can be extended to the general case of @xmath0-mer ( two values @xmath27 and @xmath29 appear in blocks of length @xmath0 ) where the resonant energy is defined through the following condition @xmath46 we note that as the block size @xmath0 increases the number of resonant states proportional to @xmath47 increases as well .",

    "for the dimer case defined by the two values of @xmath90@xmath91 we can set without loss of generality @xmath90@xmath92 . as a result , the motion corresponding to @xmath90@xmath93 is represented by the circle in the phase plane @xmath81 and resonant behavior results when , after a given number of kicks with @xmath90@xmath94 the trajectory returns to this circle .",

    "the above scheme is also valid for the much more general case where the locations of the @xmath100 functions @xmath101 in the original model eq .",

    "therefore , we conclude that in the case of a generalized dimer where time displacements @xmath108 and on - site potential are paired , in a way such that @xmath109 and @xmath110 , the condition for the critical energy will be similar to the one obtained previously but with the change @xmath111      the representation of the model of eq .",
    "( [ tbe2 ] ) used in section 2.2 allows for the study of global properties of eigenstates .",
    "in particular , the resonant delocalized states correspond to a bounded motion described by the maps of eqs ( [ mmap1]),([mmap2a]),([mmap2b ] ) .",
    "localized states on the other hand are represented by unbounded trajectories that escape from the origin of phase space @xmath81 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "( 4 ) for the case of random dimers with non - resonant values of @xmath112 .",
    "the exponential increase of a distance from the origin @xmath113 is related to the localization length of the corresponding eigenstate . in order to study the dependence of the localization length @xmath114 for nearly - resonant states , it is useful to pass to action - angle variables @xmath115 for the map of eq .",

    "one can show that in such a representation , the expression ( [ rmap ] ) is directly related to the stretching of the phase , @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , the original quantum problem is reduced to the study of the properties of a one - dimensional time - dependent map and its tangent space .",
    "due to correlations in the sequence @xmath129 , the expression ( [ gamma ] ) can not be evaluated directly .",

    "we note that the higher the order of the resonance , @xmath139 ( i.e. the higher @xmath140 in @xmath141 $ ] ) , the larger is the localization length , and thus better transport properties are expected .",
    "such a behaviour of @xmath142 is expected since for @xmath139 the second term of @xmath143 ( where @xmath112 appears in the denominator ) in eq .",
    "( [ tbe2 ] ) becomes negligible resulting to a tight - binding equation with zero on - site potential .",
    "the localization length increases also when decreasing @xmath144 towards zero .",
    "this is easily comprehended since when @xmath145 we recover the properties of the perfect lattice . finally , as the concentration @xmath136 of dimers decreases , the value of the localization length for the near resonant states increases .",
    "in this section we examine the transport properties of our system by studying the behavior of the transmission coefficient .",

    ", we recast the two successive maps of eqs ( [ mmap2a]),([mmap2b ] ) to the following two - dimensional map @xmath160 @xmath161 which is related to the transfer matrix @xmath11 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmap ] ) through a similarity transformation @xmath162 @xmath163 from the above eq.([simtr ] ) and eq.([trans1 ] ) , one obtains for the transmition coefficient @xmath164 of a system with @xmath146 scatterers : @xmath165 where the matrix @xmath166 is the product transfer matrix i.e @xmath167 . from eq.([trans2 ] ) we see that the sum inside the first parenthesis in the denominator is equal to the inner product of the vector @xmath168 i.e. to the modulus square of the vector @xmath169 evolved under the dynamical map ( [ plom ] ) ( or equivalently under the map ( [ mmap2a ] , [ mmap2b ] ) ) for time @xmath170 , in the phase space of the parametric linear oscillator described by the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) .",
    "similarly , the sum inside the second parenthesis in the denominator in eq.([trans2 ] ) corresponds to the modulus square after the evolution for time @xmath170 of the initial vector @xmath171 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the initial vectors @xmath172 correspond to the unit vectors pointing to the two perpendicular directions on the phase - space plain .    using these observations",
    ", we can give a geometrical interpretation for eq.([trans2 ] ) viz . to relate @xmath164 with areas in the phase - space of the two dimensional hamiltonian map ( [ ham2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we can interpret the sum inside each parenthesis in the denominator , as the area of a circle described by a radius @xmath173 which is given by the time evolution ( under the map ( [ plom ] ) ) of the initial vectors @xmath174 .",
    "thus eq.([trans2 ] ) can be rewritten in the following form @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the sum of the areas defined by the radius @xmath177 at time @xmath170 . in the case of perfect lattice where we have simple rotations of the initial vectors",
    "@xmath178 , the areas defined after time @xmath146 will be the same @xmath179 and hence @xmath180 .    using eq .",

    "the results we have obtained so far provide an exact , although non - closed , analytical description of any one - dimensional system that can be written in the tight - binding form of eq.([tbe2 ] ) .",
    "we will now evaluate them for the specific case of rdkp to describe those relevant features of the transmission coefficient that may be the fingerprint of extended states .    in fig .",
    "6a , b we show numerical results for a system of 10000 scatterers after averaging over more than 10000 different realizations of the disordered sample .",
    "we take the values of @xmath184 and @xmath185 and the defect concentration @xmath186 i.e. the most random case . in fig .",
    "6a we used the critical energy @xmath187 lying inside the second zone of the spectrum while fig .",
    "6b @xmath188 lying inside the @xmath189 zone .",
    "we note that states close to the resonant energies have very good transmission properties , similar to those at the resonant energy where the transmition coefficient @xmath190 is equal to one .",
    "this is compatible with the findings of the random dimer model with one - band ( tight - binding approximation ) @xcite .",
    "moreover in rdkp model , the width of the peaks depends on the order of the resonance , as mentioned previously ( see also @xcite ) . from the comparison between fig .",

    "we use the same values of @xmath192 and @xmath193 . by comparison with fig .",
    "6a we conclude that as @xmath136 decreases the number of transparent states , i.e states with transmition coeffissient close to one @xmath194 , increases , in perfect agreement with the results of the previous section for the localization length of nearly - resonant states .",
    "we have studied a kronig - penney model with binary on - site disorder randomly assigned every two sites .",
    "for such a model it was found @xcite that there exist infinite number of special energies @xmath195 at which transparent states appear .",
    "we recover these results using a new approach based on classical hamiltonian maps .",
    "we generalized our results for a @xmath0-mer case and obtained a simple expression for the resonant energy values .",
    "we constructed a phase diagram in the @xmath196 plane which marks three distinct regions : one where no resonant states appear , the second that contains some of the resonant states and the third that contains all possible resonant states for different correlated blocks of size @xmath0 .",
    "this separation in three distinct regions is valid only in the first zone and as a result it might have some relevance to the low temperature system properties .",
    "our dynamical system approach maps resonant delocalized states to bounded trajectories , while localized states are represented by unbounded trajectories in the phase space @xmath81 . making use of an expansion in the vicinity of the resonance , we derived an analytical expression of eq .",
    "( [ estimate ] ) for the lyapunov exponent for the nearly resonant states . finally , in the frame of our hamiltonian map we established a simple geometrical picture for the transmition coefficient showing that it corresponds to evolution of areas in the phase space of a linear parametric oscillator . using these last results we calculated the transmission coefficient that exhibits peaks up to @xmath197 for energy values equal to the resonant ones .",
    "near the resonant energies there are nearly - transparent states with large transmition coefficient , the number of which is inversely proportional to the defect concentration @xmath136 and increases with the resonance order .",
