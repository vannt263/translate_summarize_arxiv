    "understanding hadron mass changes in nuclear medium and/or at finite temperature can provide valuable information about the qcd vacuum@xcite .",
    "while the mass shifts for hadrons made of light quarks are sensitive to the restoration of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry breaking@xcite , those for the the heavy quark systems are sensitive to the changes of the non - perturbative gluon fields in nuclear matter . for the @xmath0 , which consists of a charm and anticharm quark pair , both the qcd sum rules analysis @xcite and the lo perturbative qcd calculation @xcite show that its mass is reduced slightly in the nuclear matter mainly due to the reduction of the gluon condensate ( @xmath4 ) in nuclear matter , which is expected to decrease by 6% at normal nuclear matter density .",
    "however , the changes are much larger for excited charmonium states , due mainly to larger color dipole size of these excited states .    in this report , we summarize the expected mass shift for charmonium states in nuclear matter and study the feasibility of observing such mass shift in the future accelerator project at gsi@xcite .",
    "the lowest dimensional qcd operators that characterizes the non perturbative nature of the qcd vacuum are the quark and gluon condensate .",
    "these condensate are estimated to have the following large non - perturbative expectation values in the vacuum @xcite , @xmath5 the gluon condensate can be written as the difference between the magnetic @xmath6 and electric @xmath7 condensate , which respectively contribute to half of the zero temperature gluon condensate , @xmath8 the above relation follows naturally from the euclidean formulation of qcd at zero temperature , such as in the lattice qcd , where the euclidean space electric ( magnetic ) condensate is defined with a minus ( plus ) sign relative to its minkowski space counterpart@xcite . due to the symmetry in the time and space directions in the 4 dimensional euclidean space",
    ", the euclidean space electric condensate is expected to have the same expectation value as the magnetic one@xcite .",
    "hence the relation among the minkowski space condensate in eq.([be ] ) follows .    at nuclear matter ,",
    "the non perturbative quark and gluon field configuration are expected to change appreciably , such that the average gluon and quark condensate values decrease by 6% and 30% , respectively .",
    "these model independent results are obtained from the linear density approximation and the nucleon expectation values of the quark and gluon condensate , which are respectively known from the experimentally measured pi - n sigma term and from taking the nucleon expectation value of the trace anomaly relation@xcite .",
    "the electric and magnetic part of the gluon condensate at nuclear matter can be estimated separately , by using the twist-2 gluon operator , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the second moment of the gluon distribution in the nucleon and is around 0.45 , when the renormalization scale is in the of order 1 to 2 gev . using this and the linear density approximation",
    ", we have , @xmath11 here , @xmath12 gev is the mass of the nucleon in the chiral limit@xcite , which comes from taking the nucleon expectation value of the trace anomaly relation @xmath13 . as can be seen from eq.([be2 ] ) , due to the additional factor of @xmath14 in the second terms , the changes are dominated by the contribution from the first terms .",
    "the mass shift of charmonium states in nuclear medium can be evaluated in the perturbative qcd when the charm quark mass is large , i.e. , @xmath15 . in this limit",
    ", one can perform a systematic operator product expansion ( ope ) of the charm quark - antiquark current - current correlation function between the heavy bound states by taking the separation scale ( @xmath16 ) to be the binding energy of the charmonium @xcite .",
    "the forward scattering matrix element of the charm quark bound state with a nucleon then has the following form : @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the wilson coefficient evaluated with the charm quark bound state wave function and @xmath19 is the nucleon expectation value of local operators of dimension @xmath20 .    for heavy quark systems",
    ", there are only two independent lowest dimension operators ; the gluon condensate ( @xmath21 ) and the condensate of twist-2 gluon operator multiplied by @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "these operators can be rewritten in terms of the color electric and magnetic fields : @xmath24 and @xmath25 . since the wilson coefficient for @xmath26 vanishes in the non - relativistic limit , the only contribution is thus proportional to @xmath24 , similar to the usual second - order stark effect .",
    "we shall thus calculate the mass shift of charmonium states due to change of the gluon condensate in nuclear medium by the qcd second - order stark effect @xcite .",
    "the mass shift of charmonium states to leading order in density is obtained by multiplying the leading term in eq.([ope ] ) , by the nuclear density @xmath27 .",
    "this gives , @xmath28 in the above , @xmath29 and @xmath27 are the nucleon mass and the nuclear density , respectively ; @xmath30 gev@xmath31 is the nucleon expectation value of the color electric field obtained from eq.([be2 ] ) and @xmath32 . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the lo mass shift formula was derived in the large charm quark mass limit . as a result ,",
    "the wave function @xmath33 is coulombic and the mass shift is expressed in terms of the bohr radius @xmath34 and the binding energy @xmath35 .",
    "this might be a good approximation for @xmath0 but is not realistic for the excited charmonium states as eq.([stark ] ) involves the derivative of the wave function , which measures the dipole size of the system .",
    "we have thus rewritten in the above the lo formula for charmonium mass shift in terms of the qcd parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which are fixed by the energy splitting between @xmath0 and @xmath2 in free space@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we take wave functions of the charmonium state to be gaussian with the oscillator constant @xmath38 determined by their squared radii @xmath39 @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and 1 fm@xmath31 for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively , as obtained from the potential models @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath44 0.52 , 0.43 , 0.39 , and 0.37 gev if we assume that these charmonium states are in the @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 states , respectively .",
    "using these parameters , we find that the mass shifts at normal nuclear matter density obtained from the lo qcd formula eq.([stark ] ) are -8 , -40 , -100 , and -140 mev for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively@xcite .    although the higher twist effects on the charmonium masses are expected to be nontrivial , the result for @xmath0 is consistent with those from other non - perturbative qcd studies , such as the qcd sum rules @xcite and the effective potential model @xcite , which are all based on the dipole interactions between quarks in the charmonium and those in the nuclear matter .",
    "the qcd sum rule results can also be applied for the @xmath1 states , and the results from the leading order gluon condensate is summarized in table .",
    "[ t1 ] .",
    "higher twist effects can be estimated in some calculations .",
    "for qcd sum rules for @xmath0 , the corrections coming from dimension 6 operators are less than 30% of the leading order results@xcite . the contributions from the @xmath49 meson loops in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 are also found to be less than 30% of the lo qcd result@xcite ."
