    "small dimensionless numbers in physics should have a known dynamical origin @xcite .",
    "however , nature contains a number of unexplained , seemingly fundamental small quantities , such as the ratio between the weak scale and the planck scale @xmath8 , and the ratios of known fermion masses to the weak scale @xmath9 .",
    "the former is subject to large radiative corrections in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "but the hierarchy @xmath10 could be explained by dynamically broken supersymmetry with superpartner masses near the weak scale , and the superpartner spectrum restricted such that it satisfies experimental constraints on flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and cp violation @xcite . by contrast , the fermion masses are protected by an approximate chiral symmetry .",
    "however , the sm requires tiny dimensionless parameters to reproduce the measured spectrum .",
    "these parameters could be produced dynamically by the spontaneous breaking of a flavor symmetry .",
    "a complete model would successfully predict the entire spectrum of scalars and fermions with a lagrangian that only contained coupling constants of order unity . in this article , we present a model of supersymmetry and flavor which is renormalizable and natural , and avoids excessive fcnc .",
    "all mass scales are generated dynamically from the fundamental scale of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "one way of mediating breaking to the observable sector is through gauge interactions @xcite . in some of the first complete models of gauge mediated breaking ( gmsb ) , a new gauge group , @xmath11 , couples to both a dynamical supersymmetry breaking ( dsb ) sector and a ` messenger ' sector to which breaking is communicated via loop effects @xcite .",
    "the messenger sector consists of superfields that are vector - like with respect to the sm gauge group ( ) and other superfields that are singlets .",
    "at least one singlet has a non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) with both scalar and auxiliary components , which in turn give and non - masses respectively to the vector - like fields .",
    "squarks , sleptons and gauginos receive breaking masses from loop corrections involving the messenger sector and sm gauge fields .",
    "the mass contributions come from gauge interactions and are therefore flavor independent .",
    "hence , the three generations of scalars are very nearly degenerate , naturally suppressing unwanted contributions to fcnc . efforts to improve this scenario have been made in the last few years , including attempts to remove the messenger sector and allow the dsb sector to carry quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "the most successful models of flavor are based on a mechanism developed by froggatt and nielsen in the late 70 s @xcite . in their original models ,",
    "the small yukawa couplings of the sm are forbidden by an additional ( gauged ) 1x symmetry .",
    "quarks and leptons instead couple to froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) fields ( heavy fermions in vector - like representations of ) , and scalar flavons , @xmath12 ( singlets ) .",
    "non - zero flavon vevs , @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the mass of the fn fields ) , break the 1x and cause mixing between the heavy and light fermions .",
    "this produces yukawa couplings in the low energy effective theory proportional to the small ratio @xmath15 to some power @xmath16 . here",
    ", @xmath16 depends on the charges of the relevant fermions .",
    "a clever choice of charges can produce the correct quark and lepton masses and quark mixing angles , all with couplings of order unity .",
    "these models of fermion masses and gmsb share a number of significant features . both make use of an additional gauged u(1 ) symmetry which is spontaneously broken , both contain heavy vector - like quarks and leptons and both contain fields that are singlets under .",
    "these similarities are striking and compel one to ask if these two mechanisms can be incorporated efficiently into the same model .",
    "there are , however , major differences between the two mechanisms .",
    "the biggest difference comes from the fact that in the fn mechanism the vector - like fields and some of the sm fields are charged under the u(1 ) .",
    "if the same were true in gmsb , the squarks would not , in general , be degenerate",
    ". however , large contributions to fcnc and cp violation can be suppressed if the first two generations of squarks are very heavy , as in `` effective supersymmetry '' @xcite . if the first two generations carry u(1 ) charges , their scalar components would be heavy due to loop effects , while their fermion masses would be suppressed .",
    "models of this kind have been built with the u(1 ) anomalies canceled at a high scale by the green - schwartz mechanism @xcite .",
    "in this article , we present a model that dynamically generates both fermion and scalar masses using a single gauged u(1 ) which is non - anomalous . in doing so ,",
    "we employ a modified version of the fn mechanism .",
    "we produce the small ratio @xmath15 in a similar fashion .",
    "however , the range of small parameters comes predominantly from the use of flavons with different vevs producing different ratios as opposed to different powers of the same ratio .",
    "this method requires fewer fn fields ( at the cost of requiring more flavons ) , allowing us to avoid a landau pole in @xmath17 below @xmath18 . while requiring u(1 ) charge assignments to be consistent with 5 , we are able to cancel all gauge anomalies , and we are able to find reasonable fermion mass matrices with fundamental coupling constants of order unity .",
    "the spectrum includes a massless up quark , a viable solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows : section 2 describes the overall design of the model , the mass spectrum of the scalars and the restrictions on the u(1 ) charges required for this spectrum .",
    "section 3 describes the fermion mass matrices allowed within these restrictions .",
    "section 4 describes the contributions to fcnc and shows that they fall within experimental bounds .",
    "section 5 describes some interesting cosmological effects of the model , and section 6 concludes the paper .",
    "the appendix shows why squarks can not be degenerate in this approach .",
    "in this section , we describe the overall structure of the model .",
    "the highest scale defined in our model is the one at which breaks .",
    "this breaking occurs in the dsb sector at @xmath19 this scale is generated dynamically via nonperturbative effects . because there are currently many types of models in which is known or believed to be broken dynamically @xcite , and because we have very few requirements of this sector , we will leave it largely unspecified .",
    "however , the sector must contain a global u(1 ) symmetry which can be identified with a @xmath11 gauge symmetry that communicates breaking to the rest of the model .",
    "once the dsb sector is integrated out , all lower scales will be generated dynamically through radiative effects .      in order to naturally produce the small fermion masses of the sm",
    ", our model contains froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) fields which are in vector - like representations of .",
    "a 1x gauge symmetry forbids most of the sm yukawa couplings .",
    "the sm fields ( @xmath20 ) instead couple to the fn fields ( @xmath21 ) and flavons ( @xmath22 ) in the superpotential @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a higgs superfield .",
    "the scalar vev of @xmath25 produces a mass term for the fn fields . if @xmath12 has a scalar component with a vev such that @xmath26 , then the low energy description of this theory will contain the superpotential term @xmath27 ( see figure [ fnmec ] ) .",
    "thus a small coupling is produced dynamically from coupling constants of order unity .",
    "different small yukawa couplings can be produced by flavons with different vevs .",
    "the 1x charges are chosen so as to produce fermion masses and mixing angles that mimic those experimentally measured .",
    "the dsb sector will also have fields charged under 1x .",
    "all other matter is assumed to couple to the dsb sector only via the 1x .",
    "fields carrying this charge will receive contributions to their scalar masses at two loops . by giving the first two generations non - zero flavor charge",
    ", we can produce the effective supersymmetry spectrum @xcite .",
    "the uncharged fields will be lighter and receive their masses at one or two loops below @xmath28 ( see section  [ scalars ] ) .",
    "the first two generations are heavy and adequately suppress unwanted contributions to fcnc and cp violation ( section  [ fcnc ] ) .",
    "we choose froggatt - nielsen fields that are vector - like under and chiral under 1x .",
    "their masses at tree - level will be proportional to flavon vevs which break the flavor symmetry .",
    "this symmetry breaking is due in part to a fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term @xcite , @xmath29 , which appears in the 1x @xmath30-term : @xmath31 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the gauge coupling and @xmath33 are the 1x charges .",
    "the fields , @xmath34 represent all charged fields , including both trivial and non - trivial representations of . provided that @xmath35 vanishes , which is necessary for anomaly cancelation , the fi term only receives finite renormalization proportional to supersymmetry breaking effects .",
    "we assume that the fundamental fi term vanishes .",
    "then the effective @xmath36 depends on the dsb spectrum , and is generally an order of magnitude below @xmath28 .    at two loops ,",
    "every scalar with a non - zero @xmath33 receives a breaking mass squared proportional to its charge squared @xcite .",
    "specifically , the contribution to the effective potential is @xmath37 , where the dsb sector again determines the exact value of @xmath38 .",
    "its magnitude will generally be two orders of magnitude below @xmath29 .",
    "thus , after integrating out the dsb sector , the full effective potential looks like @xmath39 ^ 2 + \\mt \\sum_i q_i^2    higher dimension breaking terms .",
    "the 1x d - term has a large number of flat directions .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 comes from the dsb and may have either sign . as we will see in section  [ constaints ] , the squared masses of the third generation and higgs scalars come from loop corrections which depend on @xmath38 .",
    "we find we must have @xmath40 to keep squark masses positive .",
    "this choice of sign introduces runaway flat directions into eq .",
    "[ potential ] .",
    "these are curbed by the higher dimension breaking terms that we have ignored and by superpotential interactions .",
    "we will choose a superpotential and a local minimum that allows us to neglect the higher dimension terms .",
    "how can we generate the appropriate flavon vev hierarchy ?",
    "one approach is to give vevs only to @xmath25 fields at tree level .",
    "the @xmath12 flavons receive vevs at one or more loops .",
    "assume for instance that the two flavons @xmath25 and @xmath41 have vevs .",
    "the superpotential interaction @xmath42 gives a vev to the flavon @xmath12 via the diagram ( solid and dashed lines represent fermion and scalar fields respectively ) :        once @xmath12 has a vev , some other flavon @xmath43 may receive a vev by means of a similar diagram if it appears in the superpotential interaction @xmath44 . such a technique produces a hierarchy of vevs . in the above case , for instance , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are respectively one loop and two loop factors smaller than @xmath47 .",
    "generating the hierarchy of vevs requires that we assign charges to the flavons that allow the required superpotential interactions .",
    "it is also important to prevent any field that transforms non - trivially under @xmath48 from acquiring a vev .",
    "finally , additional flavons must be added to the model in order to cancel the @xmath49 and @xmath50 anomalies .",
    "preliminary calculations have shown that the above approach should yield a viable scalar potential .",
    "as we have seen , all 1x charged scalars have masses of at least order @xmath51 .",
    "uncharged scalars receive breaking contributions from a number of different sources .",
    "fields that transform non - trivially under receive contributions from two loop diagrams in the low energy theory ( below @xmath28 ) .",
    "drawing from the results of poppitz and trivedi @xcite , we find that the leading contribution to the mass of an uncharged scalar at two loops is ( up to a group theory factor ) @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of charged froggatt - nielsen pairs , @xmath54 denotes the relevant gauge group , @xmath55 is the fermionic mass of the froggatt - nielsen fields and @xmath56 is of the order of the non - holomorphic contribution to the scalar masses ( i.e. @xmath57 ) .",
    "the gaugino masses arise at one loop . using again the results of @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath58 where we have assumed that @xmath59 is significantly larger than @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath60 , where @xmath25 is a flavon whose vev gives a mass to fn fields .",
    "thus , @xmath61 .",
    "these results assume @xmath62 , which is the case for our model . in order for the gauginos ( and in particular the winos ) not to be too light compared to the lightest higgs , we require that @xmath59 be within an order of magnitude of @xmath63 ( i.e. @xmath64 ) . by choosing @xmath51 to be about @xmath65 , we find that the light higgs has a mass near the weak scale .",
    "uncharged fields with direct superpotential couplings to charged fields receive scalar mass contributions from one - loop graphs containing charged fields ( figure [ loopunch ] ) of order @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the superpotential coupling .",
    "this contribution is approximately an order of magnitude larger than the two - loop contribution above .",
    "the mass of an uncharged field may also receive a contribution from a charged field due to @xmath49 breaking if the charged and uncharged fields both appear in the same f - term .",
    "for example , let us assume that the superpotential contains @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath2 and @xmath70 are uncharged and @xmath25 and @xmath30 are charged . if @xmath25 has a non - zero vev , the squared masses of the scalar components of @xmath69 and @xmath2 receive a contribution proportional to the supersymmetry breaking mass of the scalar component of the charged @xmath30 field , @xmath71 moreover , if an uncharged field appears with a charged field in the same f - term , they may mix due to 1x breaking .",
    "for example , the f - term contribution to the scalar potential from the field @xmath70 above is @xmath72 .",
    "if both @xmath25 and @xmath2 have non - zero vevs , then @xmath69 and @xmath30 would mix .",
    "the contributions described in this and the preceding paragraphs are not flavor independent . thus , degenerate squarks are not a feasible method of avoiding fcnc .      in choosing a froggatt - nielsen sector ,",
    "our desire is to leave intact perhaps the most compelling feature of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , i.e. , the unification of gauge coupling constants . to preserve this result",
    ", our vector - like fn fields should come in complete 5 representations .",
    "in addition , 1x charges should be assigned to full multiplets . besides maintaining unification , this allows us to satisfy easily the standard anomaly conditions as well as @xmath73\\simeq 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 are scalar particle masses and y is ordinary hypercharge . if this equation were not satisfied , the @xmath75 @xmath30-term would receive an unwanted fayet - iliopoulos term at one loop .",
    "it is well - known that addition of complete @xmath48 multiplets to the standard model does not ruin coupling constant unification . in order for the gauge couplings to remain perturbative from one - loop running to the gut scale",
    ", the following inequality must be satisfied : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the number of \\{@xmath78 } pairs in addition to the standard model fields , and @xmath79 is the number of additional \\{@xmath80 } pairs .",
    "two loop contributions to the beta functions will modify this condition , with two loop gauge contributions generally reducing slightly the number of additional fields allowed and superpotential couplings increasing this number  we will assume the net two - loop effects are not too important . a realistic model of fermion masses that satisfies",
    "this condition will have @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the particle content of our model includes    * three generations of matter in 5 multiplets , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the generation index , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 denote 1x charges , * two higgs superfields , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and @xmath88 contain the standard higgs doublets . ] * froggatt - nielsen fields in vector representations of su(5 ) , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and possibly @xmath91 , * flavons ( 5 singlets ) which have non - zero vevs  some at tree - level ( @xmath25 ) , and others at one or more loops ( @xmath12 ) , and * additional fields @xmath92 which help produce a cascade of flavon vevs .",
    "another major constraint on the charge assignments of these fields comes from the experimental limits on fcnc @xcite .",
    "there are different ways to constrain squark ( and slepton ) masses in order to limit contributions to fcnc .",
    "one way is to make their masses degenerate , thus suppressing their contribution through a gim mechanism .",
    "degeneracy is a natural result and thus a virtue of the original gmsb models @xcite . in those models ,",
    "squark and slepton masses are dominated by loop corrections involving flavor - blind couplings .",
    "however , the additional structure in our model produces significant flavor dependent contributions to sparticle masses , destroying this degeneracy .",
    "therefore , to suppress fcnc , we instead decouple the problem by making the first two generations heavy @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved naturally by simply requiring the particles in the first two generations , ( @xmath93 ) , to have non - zero 1x charges .",
    "we do find , however , that some level of degeneracy must still exist between the first two generations .",
    "the following observations impose additional constraints on our model :    * to avoid fine tuning , at least one higgs must have a mass at the weak scale . therefore , one higgs must be uncharged ( under 1x ) and must not have any contact interactions with charged fields .",
    "* the higgsino mass will come from a @xmath94-type term in the superpotential , @xmath95 thus , to satisfy the previous condition , both higgs fields must be uncharged .",
    "* the top quark s yukawa coupling is of order unity and therefore does not come from the froggatt - nielsen mechanism , but from a direct coupling to the higgs : @xmath96 where c is the flavor charge and the 3 indicates the generation .",
    "we conclude that @xmath97 by @xmath49 invariance .",
    "note also that @xmath97 guarantees that the @xmath87 mass contribution is not much larger than the weak scale .",
    "figure [ spectrum ] summarizes the resulting spectrum .",
    "we want yukawa coupling matrices in the low energy effective theory that reproduce the known experimental values of fermion masses and mixing angles . in order to have a model from which the fermion masses of the sm appear naturally",
    ", we must produce the small parameters in the yukawa matrices dynamically .",
    "we accomplish this with a modified fn mechanism and a hierarchy of flavon vevs .",
    "this section describes the allowed fermion mass matrices .",
    "the masses of the fermions are generated by superpotential terms like @xmath98 , where @xmath99 are the scalar vevs of higgs or flavon superfields . to construct these superpotential terms ,",
    "we apply the following guidelines :    * we work in the context of 5 .",
    "this means our 1x charge assignments are consistent with 5 .",
    "* we want the model to be natural .",
    "any superpotential interaction should appear with a coupling constant of order unity .",
    "* the higgs fields are uncharged .",
    "the up - type higgs can not couple directly to charged fields and the fields it couples to have restricted interactions with charged fields .",
    "the third generation @xmath100 is also uncharged .",
    "* the first two generations must be charged in order to avoid large fcnc ( this will be shown explicitly ) .    from the following arguments , we will conclude that the fn sector must include one \\{@xmath100 , @xmath101 } pair and _ two _ \\{@xmath102 , @xmath103 } pairs .",
    "the model predicts a massless up quark and a large value of @xmath104 .",
    "the masses of up - type quarks come from the superpotential terms : @xmath105 while those of down - type quarks and leptons come from the terms @xmath106 because of the su(5 ) symmetry , the charged lepton mass matrix will be proportional to the down quark mass matrix . deviations will derive from su(5 ) breaking and will depend on the higgs sector of the ( grand unified ) model .",
    "we will assume that this can be done such that the correct lepton masses are predicted , and thus for convenience , we shall speak only in terms of quark masses .",
    "the quark content of the su(5 ) multiplets are : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a generation index , and @xmath85 is the 1x charge of the multiplet .",
    "schematically , the tree - level mass matrices look like    r|ccccc| & @xmath109&@xmath110&@xmath111&@xmath112&@xmath113 + @xmath114 & & + @xmath115 & & @xmath116flav- + @xmath117 & & ons@xmath118 + @xmath119 & & + @xmath120    ' '' ''    & & @xmath121 +    and    r|cccccc| & @xmath122&@xmath123&@xmath124&@xmath125&@xmath126 & @xmath127 + @xmath128 & & + @xmath129 & & @xmath116flav- + @xmath130 & & ons@xmath118 + @xmath131 & & + @xmath132    ' '' ''    & & @xmath133 + @xmath134 & & +    ,    where the 6th row and 5th column of the down quark mass matrix represent the optional ( @xmath80 ) pair .",
    "now , following the above mentioned guidelines on charge constraints , we can fill in these matrices .",
    "our strategy for avoiding large fcnc requires @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , any field that appears in one of the first two rows of either matrix has a contact interaction with a charged field .",
    "however , the up - type higgs field must not interact with 1x - charged particles , so the first two rows of the up matrix will be devoid of higgs vevs . that matrix will have a zero eigenvalue , thus predicting a massless up quark ! a vanishing up",
    "quark mass is a possible solution to the strong cp problem , as the strong phase is no longer physical and can be rotated into the up quark field via an axial rotation . for complete details on the viability of a massless up quark ,",
    "see @xcite .    to complete the up matrix",
    ", we note that if @xmath136 , this matrix would have two zero eigenvalues .",
    "since we are confident that the charm mass is not zero , we set @xmath137 .",
    "also , the froggatt - nielsen field @xmath138 must interact with @xmath139 through a flavon @xmath140 to receive a mass @xmath141 much greater than the weak scale .",
    "but @xmath138 must interact with @xmath87 as well if the the up matrix has only one zero eigenvalue . to avoid corrections to the up higgs mass of order @xmath142",
    "the fields interacting with @xmath143 must be uncharged .",
    "that is , @xmath144 .    assuming that all allowed couplings exist , we find the up matrix is completely determined and takes the form : @xmath145 where the fields @xmath146 and @xmath147 have been rotated to remove the ( 3,5 ) and ( 5,3 ) entries .",
    "for generic couplings , the ( 4,4 ) and ( 5,5 ) entries have little effect on the final results . for convenience",

    "now we shall attempt to design a down mass matrix with only one additional \\ { @xmath150 } pair .",
    "first , to prevent a zero eigenvalue , there must be at least one @xmath121 entry in one of the first two rows .",
    "however , since we wish to produce the small yukawa couplings of the first two generations dynamically , we place the entry in the 4th column . to do this",
    ", we let @xmath151 ( choosing @xmath152 would lead to the same conclusions ) .",
    "examining the first three columns , we see that in order to avoid a zero eigenvalue , at least two of @xmath54 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 must be zero .",
    "this is in contradiction with our decoupling strategy for avoiding fcnc , hence ruling out this scenario .",
    "one could ask if by setting all @xmath155 , these squarks would be degenerate . however ( see appendix ) , the degeneracy is broken by large flavor - dependent contributions .",

    ", we see our matrix is limited to @xmath157 where the question marks label undetermined entries .",
    "we see that @xmath158 can be either @xmath159 or zero , and any of the flavons in the last two rows can be removed .",
    "we now present a specific example of the above framework that yields the correct quark mass ratios and ckm angles .",
    "if the up matrix is fixed , the down mass matrix would still allow many choices .",
    "we start by choosing @xmath160 ( @xmath161 would work as well ) .",
    "the first four entries of the fourth column of @xmath162 are then @xmath121 , 0 , 0 and 0",
    ". we want , for simplicity , to limit the number of flavons appearing in the matrices .",
    "again , we can use the freedom offered by the down mass matrix .",
    "we can remove one flavon from each of the first two columns  the entries ( 6,1 ) and ( 5,2 ) are taken to be 0 .",
    "we also can take the entries ( 5,5 ) and ( 6,4 ) to be 0 .",
    "as for the third column one may ask if one could remove the two flavons in the entries ( 5,3 ) and ( 6,3 ) since it would not generate a zero eigenvalue .",
    "however in such a scenario the value of @xmath163 comes out too small as is explained farther down .",

    "it follows : @xmath181 if @xmath182 were 0 , that is if there were no entry ( 5,3 ) in the @xmath183 down matrix , @xmath163 would be of order @xmath184 , an order of magnitude too small to meet the experimental range .",
    "this short computation also applies to the general form of the down mass matrix .",

    "we work with the specific model described in section  [ example ] . in this example",
    ", we shall find that the squark contribution to the @xmath191 mass difference is small , both because the first two squark generations are heavy , and because the squark mixing angles amongst the first two generations of the down sector are very small @xcite .",

    "the relevant interactions are listed in the up and down mass matrices  ( [ upmass ] ) and  ( [ downmass ] ) .",
    "assuming that all coupling constants and vevs are complex , suitable redefinitions of the fields that do not receive vevs allow us to make some of the entries in the mass matrices real .",
    "however , two entries can not be made real .",
    "we can choose these to be the ( 3,3 ) and ( 5,3 ) entries of the down matrix . the up and down matrices are then ( ignoring real coupling constants of order 1 ) + @xmath192 + and + @xmath193 where @xmath194 and @xmath195 are two complex numbers of modulus 1 .",
    "all of the other variables in the matrices are real .",
    "the corresponding superpotential reads @xmath196 integrating out the heavy fields , we find the following up and down matrices for the light fermions : @xmath197 and @xmath198 from which we get the ckm matrix : @xmath199 only the significant phases have been retained . the phases of @xmath194 and @xmath195 are assumed to be of order 1 .",
    "the remaining entries have phases of order @xmath200 or less .",
    "such a ckm matrix yields reasonable values of @xmath201 and @xmath190 from the weak interactions .",
    "the contribution of the gluino box to @xmath189 mixing remains to be computed .",
    "to compute this requires the squark mass matrix .",
    "we consider tree level and one loop mass terms generated by the effective scalar potential .",
    "we assume that all of the flavons appearing in one line or column of the mass matrices are distinct ( this is automatically satisfied if all the standard model fields have different charges ) .",
    "this implies that there are no off - diagonal one - loop corrections to the squark mass matrix of order : @xmath202 indeed , if for example @xmath203 , we could have @xmath204 .",
    "the f - term of @xmath205 would yield the interaction : @xmath206 from which we could get the one - loop scalar graph :        whose supersymmetry breaking part is of the order of the above correction .",
    "the only one loop corrections to off diagonal terms come from the supersymmetry breaking part of scalar graphs like :        both left - handed squarks ( lh ) and right - handed squarks ( rh ) will contribute to these processes .",
    "we first consider the case of the lh down squarks , since as we shall see their contribution is the largest . at tree level , the masses of the lh down type squarks come from the hermitian matrix ( omitting the vev symbol @xmath207 for clarity ) : @xmath208 where we have written only the main contribution to each matrix element .",
    "there are other tree level contributions to the masses of the lh down squarks since some mixing occurs with the rh down squarks .",
    "however , as we note at the end of the present section , these terms are small and can be ignored for an order of magnitude computation .    as mentioned above ,",
    "any off - diagonal entry of the mass matrix may receive a one - loop contribution .",
    "the correction is of order @xmath209 the masses appearing in the @xmath210 are the masses of the heavier scalar particle running in the loop and of its fermionic partner .",
    "some loop corrections come from known superpotential interactions between @xmath48 and flavon fields in  ( [ potexa ] ) .",
    "for instance , from the f - terms of @xmath211 and @xmath212 , we get a diagram that mixes @xmath128 with @xmath130 :        the resulting term is @xmath213    other loop corrections may arise from terms in the flavon superpotential . without knowing explicitly the flavon superpotential ,",
    "we can not tell if one specific entry receives a correction and if so what the vevs @xmath214 and @xmath215 are .",
    "we will assume that any off - diagonal term in the matrix receives such a correction with a phase of order 1 and that the vev product is of the order of @xmath216 with @xmath217 .",
    "this last value is an overestimate ( most likely the vev product is of the order of the product of two @xmath12 vevs ) .",
    "for example , assuming a flavon superpotential containing the terms @xmath218 and @xmath219 , we obtain an off - diagonal term mixing @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the loop correction is equal to @xmath220 .",
    "we assume that @xmath221 is of the same order as @xmath216 .",
    "we may now estimate the angles at the squark - quark - gluino vertex with the quarks and squarks taken as mass eigenstates .",
    "for the lh quarks , the angles are given by the matrix that diagonalizes @xmath222 : @xmath223 off - diagonal elements in the third line and column have the same order one phase .",
    "the elements ( 1,2 ) and ( 2,1 ) have a smaller phase of order @xmath224 .    for the squarks , we first integrate out the heavy fields and then rotate the light squark mass matrix . doing so , we find the following symmetric matrix as an estimate for the rotation matrix : @xmath225 where the off - diagonal elements of the third line and column have phases of order 1 and the entries ( 1,2 ) and ( 2,1 ) have a phase of order @xmath200 .",
    "the vev @xmath226 is a generic value for the vevs of @xmath227 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 , which we assume to be all of the same order .",
    "the value of @xmath230 depends on the dsb .",
    "a typical value is @xmath231 .",
    "as before , @xmath232 is taken to be @xmath200 .",
    "the product of the above matrices yields the matrix @xmath233 at the squark - quark - gluino vertices @xmath234 where off - diagonal elements ( 1,3 ) and ( 2,3 ) have phases which are of order 1 but differ by a term of order @xmath200 .",
    "the ( 1,2 ) angle has a phase of @xmath200 .",
    "the contribution of the lh squarks alone to the box diagram is @xcite : @xmath235 where @xmath236 and @xmath237 the indices i and j refer to the squarks and run from 1 to 3 .",
    "the index g stands for the gluino , whose mass is at the weak scale ( @xmath238 ) .",
    "parameters @xmath239 , @xmath240 and @xmath17 are the k mass , k decay constant and strong coupling constant ( @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 ) .    given the above @xmath233 matrix and taking @xmath244",
    ", we find all contributions to @xmath245 and @xmath190 are within the experimental values .",
    "for instance , a lh bottom squark of mass @xmath246 gives a contribution to @xmath245 of @xmath247 and to @xmath190 of @xmath248 .",
    "other possibilities involving first or second generations squarks give smaller contributions .    the same computation done with the rh down quarks and squarks give the following matrix @xmath249 ( again neglecting left - right mixing ) : @xmath250 where all off diagonal entries have a phase of order 1 .",
    "this matrix gives contributions to @xmath245 and @xmath190 well below the experimental bounds .",
    "we now consider the mixing between lh and rh squarks and confirm that it can be neglected .    at tree level",
    ", a mu term @xmath251 generates mixing between @xmath252 and @xmath253 and also between the light squarks , @xmath253 , @xmath254 , and @xmath255 , and heavy squarks , namely @xmath256 , @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "these terms come with a coefficient @xmath259 and possibly a phase of order 1 .",
    "they are of the same order as the loop corrections previously considered and would not change the order of magnitude of @xmath233 and @xmath249 .",
    "additional mixing may occur due to the flavon superpotential .",
    "for instance , the flavon @xmath260 could appear in the flavon superpotential in a term @xmath261 .",
    "assuming that @xmath30 and @xmath262 receive a vev , a mixing term between @xmath255 and @xmath263 is generated .",
    "its coefficient is @xmath264 .",
    "similarly , via @xmath265 , we discover a mixing term between @xmath254 and @xmath263 could also be generated ( with coefficient @xmath266 equal to a product of flavon vevs ) .",
    "this would mean that when integrating out @xmath263 , the entry ( 1,2 ) of @xmath249 would receive a contribution @xmath267 .",
    "the previous analysis could be invalidated if @xmath266 and @xmath268 were large , causing contributions to fcnc and cp violation beyond experimental bounds .",
    "we must constrain the choice of the flavon superpotential .",
    "we assume that the vev product @xmath269 is of the order of @xmath270 with a small phase ( @xmath271 ) or of the order of @xmath272 with a phase of order 1 .",
    "if so , the orders of magnitude of @xmath233 and @xmath249 are unchanged .",
    "these restrictions are reasonable since most @xmath12 fields do not interact directly with a @xmath25 field .    with these restrictions ,",
    "left - right angles remain small ( of the order of @xmath248 or less ) except for the mixing angle between @xmath252 and @xmath253 which is about @xmath200 .",
    "the contribution to the gluino box of left - right effects is then well below the experimental values .",
    "we may conclude that the framework of our model accommodates the current experimental bounds on fcnc and cp violation for the @xmath0 system . the important point in this analysis",
    "was to assume that there were no loop corrections to off - diagonal entries given by @xmath273 which would generate angles of order @xmath224 . with such a correction , fcnc are still within the experimental values",
    ". however , cp violation would be much larger than the experimental bound if the correction came with a phase of order 1 .",
    "this analysis is applicable to the @xmath2-system .",
    "the entries in the third column of @xmath233 are large and with a phase of order 1 and the mass of the left - handed bottom squark is at the weak scale .",
    "therefore , the supersymmetric contribution to cp violation in @xmath1 mixing can be as large as the weak interaction contribution@xcite .",
    "also new contributions to cp violating decay amplitudes may arise with significant departures from the sm predictions . as for fcnc phenomena in b physics ,",
    "the model provides sizeable new contributions to the mixing and the b radiative decays , but always keeping below the experimental results .",
    "another possible constraint on new sources of cp violation comes from electric dipole moment ( edm ) bounds on the neutron and on atoms .",
    "our model contains a massless up quark and thus there is no strong cp violation .",
    "though there are several new sources of cp violation , supersymmetric contributions to edm s are sufficiently suppressed due to the large mass of the first two superpartner generations .",
    "supersymmetric models , where the messenger sector is identified with the froggatt - nielsen sector and a single @xmath274 symmetry is used both to give large masses to the first two generations of sfermions and to generate the flavor spectrum , are of considerable interest @xcite from the cosmological point of view . indeed ,",
    "this class of low energy supersymmetry breaking models naturally predicts ( superconducting ) cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "the presence of an fayet - iliopoulos @xmath30-term @xmath29 induces the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath274 gauge symmetry along some field direction in the messenger sector .",
    "let us denote this field direction generically by @xmath275 and its @xmath274 charge by @xmath276 . in this case local cosmic strings",
    "are formed whose mass per unit length is given by @xmath277 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath36 is a few orders of magnitude larger than the weak scale , cosmic strings are not very heavy .",
    "the crucial point is that some quark and/or the lepton superfields are charged under the @xmath274 group .",
    "let us focus on one of the sfermion fields , @xmath278 with generic @xmath274-charge @xmath279 , such that sign @xmath280 sign @xmath276 .",
    "the potential for the fields @xmath275 and @xmath278 is written as @xmath281    where we have assumed , for simplicity , that @xmath278 is @xmath59-flat .",
    "the parameter @xmath67 is generated from the standard model gauge group @xmath30-terms and vanishes if we take @xmath278 to denote a family of fields parameterizing a @xmath30-flat direction .",
    "at the global minimum @xmath282 and the electric charge , the baryon and/or the lepton numbers are conserved .",
    "the soft breaking mass term for the sfermion reads @xmath283 and is positive by virtue of the hierarchy @xmath284 ( recalling @xmath285 ) .",
    "consistency with experimental bound requires @xmath286 to be of the order of @xmath287 or so , which in turn requires @xmath288 .",
    "notice that @xmath289 does not depend upon @xmath29 .",
    "let us analyze what happens in the core of the string . in this region of space ,",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the field vanishes , @xmath290 , and nonzero values of @xmath291 since the vortex is cylindrically symmetric around the @xmath292-axis , the condensate will be of the form @xmath293 , where @xmath86 and @xmath294 are the polar coordinate in the @xmath295-plane .",
    "one can check easily that the kinetic term for @xmath278 also allows a nonzero value of @xmath278 in the string and therefore one expects the existence of bosonic charge carriers inside the strings .",
    "the latter are , therefore , superconducting .",
    "these superconducting cosmic strings formed at temperatures within a few orders of magnitude of the weak scale may generate primordial magnetic fields @xcite and even give rise to the observed baryon asymmetry @xcite .",
    "indeed , during their evolution , the superconducting cosmic strings carry some baryon charge . the latter is efficiently preserved from the sphaleron erasure and may be released in the thermal bath at low temperatures . in such a case ,",
    "the charge carriers inside the strings are provided by the scalar superpartner of the fermions that carry baryon ( lepton ) number .",
    "since these scalar condensates are charged under @xmath296 , baryon number violating processes are frozen in the core of the strings and the baryon charge number can not be wiped out at temperatures larger than @xmath297 gev . in other words ,",
    "the superconducting strings act like `` bags '' containing the baryon charge and protect it from sphaleron wash - out throughout the evolution of the universe , until baryon number violating processes become harmless .",
    "this mechanism is efficient even if the electroweak phase transition in the mssm is of the second order and therefore does not impose any upper bound on the mass of the higgs boson @xcite .",
    "we have presented a renormalizable model of low energy flavor and supersymmetry breaking in which all mass scales are produced dynamically . a u(1 )",
    "gauge group mediates large contributions to the masses of the first two generations of scalars , of order 20 tev , while suppressing the masses of their fermionic partners .",
    "excessive fcnc are successfully avoided , in part , by decoupling the scalars of the first two families .",
    "cp violation in the kaon system is also predicted to be within experimental bounds .",
    "we are able to produce the observed fermion masses and mixing angles while maintaining perturbative unification of gauge coupling constants at @xmath298 .",
    "however , we did not explicitly construct a complete model of flavon interactions having the correct vacuum , though we have made it plausible that one could be produced .",
    "our goal was to produce a model in which the sectors responsible for scalar masses and fermion masses could be identified .",
    "the resulting model , as an unintended consequence , potentially solves at least two major problems of fundamental physics .",
    "first , the model predicts a massless up quark . this is the simplest viable solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "second , the model predicts the existence of light superconducting cosmic strings , which could be the source of the magnetic fields that are observed on the cosmological scale .",
    "these strings may also be responsible for the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "our model suffers from the same @xmath94-term problem that exists in most gauge mediated models @xcite .",
    "we can naturally generate a @xmath94-term via loop corrections if we include , for example , the terms @xmath299 , @xmath300 and @xmath301 . at one loop",
    ", a @xmath94-term appears with coupling constant @xmath302 , where @xmath303 .",
    "as pointed out by dvali , pomarol and giudice @xcite , the scalar coupling , @xmath304 , also appears at one loop with @xmath305 , which is too large for natural electroweak symmetry breaking",
    ". it may be possible to adopt the mechanisms of reference @xcite to suppress this @xmath306 term , or to produce acceptable @xmath94 and @xmath306 terms via the mechanism of ref .",
    "@xcite .    as the first renormalizable and explicit example of the effective supersymmetry @xcite approach to flavor and supersymmetry breaking",
    ", this model reproduces the success of the standard model in explaining the observed size of fcnc and absence of lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) .",
    "in fact this model is surprisingly successful , as the supersymmetric contributions to cp violating effects in @xmath307 mixing , which even with 20 tev squarks are potentially 100 times too large , are sufficiently small .",
    "the cp violating phases in @xmath308 and @xmath309 mixing receive a large nonstandard contribution from left - handed bottom squark exchange .",
    "it remains to be calculated whether any other nonstandard fcnc , cp violating , and lfv effects are large enough to be revealed by new , more stringent experiments .",
