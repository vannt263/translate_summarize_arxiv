    "the currently accepted model for gamma - ray burst phenomena involves the violent formation of an approximately solar - mass black hole surrounded by a similarly massive debris torus .",
    "the gamma - ray burst is powered by the release of binding energy as the debris torus is accreted onto the black hole .",
    "the formation of the black hole and debris torus may take place through the coalescence of a compact binary or the collapse of a quickly rotating massive stellar core ; the gamma - ray burst emission may take place at the site of crossing internal shock waves within the expanding relativistic fireball powered by the accretion onto the black hole , or as the fireball is decelerated by the interstellar medium @xcite .    a gravitational - wave burst is likely to be associated with the formation of the rapidly rotating , central black - hole engine of a gamma - ray burst .",
    "the character of the gravitational - wave burst ( e.g. ,  energy , spectrum , polarization ) will depend on the degree of non - axisymmetry associated with the collapse , and thus its progenitor @xcite .",
    "similarly , the relative time of arrival of the gravitational and gamma - ray bursts will depend on whether the gamma - ray burst is generated by internal shocks in the exploding fireball or external shocks when the fireball is decelerated by the interstellar medium .",
    "observation of gravitational - wave bursts associated with gamma - ray bursts thus may reveal details of the gamma - ray burst mechanism that can not be revealed through observations of the gamma rays alone . in this paper",
    "we examine how gravitational - wave observations using the ligo detectors @xcite can be made in conjunction with gamma - ray burst observations by the swift satellite to determine whether there is an association between gamma - ray and gravitational - wave bursts , a first step in the ambitious program of developing gravitational - wave observations into a tool of astronomical discovery .",
    "@xcite have described how the cross - correlated output of two gravitational - wave detectors , taken in coincidence with gamma - ray burst ( grb ) events , can be used to detect or place upper limits on the emission of gravitational - wave bursts ( gwbs ) by grbs .",
    "this procedure has already been used in the analysis of data from the explorer and nautilus gravitational - wave detectors at times associated with 47 grbs detected by the bepposax satellite to bound , at 95% confidence , the root - mean - square gravitational - wave strain @xmath0 associated with these grbs to less than @xmath1 in the gravitational - wave - detector waveband ( approximately 0.5 hz about 900 hz ) , assuming that the gamma rays originate in internal shocks @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate that 1000 grb observations combined with observations from the ( broad - band ) initial ligo detectors could produce an upper limit on the gravitational - wave strain associated with grbs of approximately @xmath2 at 95% confidence .",
    "an important consequence of the cosmological origin of grbs is their isotropic distribution on the sky . in their original work",
    "@xcite assumed that grbs would be detected isotropically as well  i.e. ,  that the grb detector had an isotropic antenna pattern .",
    "they did note , however , that the swift satellite , a next - generation multi - wavelength satellite dedicated to the study of grbs , does not have an isotropic antenna pattern and that this has potentially important consequences for the ability of the combined gamma - ray burst / gravitational - wave detector array to detect or limit the gravitational - wave flux on earth owing to grbs . here",
    "we study this question specifically in the context of the swift satellite and the ligo gravitational - wave detectors ; i.e. ,  we determine , as a function of swift s pointing , the sensitivity of the swift / ligo detector array to gravitational waves from grbs , and propose a figure - of - merit that can be used in swift mission scheduling to optimize the sensitivity of the swift / ligo array to the gravitational - wave flux from grbs .",
    "we find that the upper limit that can be placed on @xmath0 differs by a factor of 2 between best and worst orientations of the satellite .",
    "we begin in section  2 with a review of how @xcite proposed using student s @xmath3-test to detect a grb  gwb association and place an upper limit on the gravitational - wave strength associated with grbs .",
    "we extract the direction dependence of this upper limit in section  3 , and apply to the case of swift in section  4 .",
    "we conclude with some brief remarks in section  5 .",
    "@xcite described how the signal from two independent gravitational - wave detectors can be analyzed to identify the gravitational - wave signal associated with gamma - ray bursts and either bound or measure the population average of the gravitational - wave flux on earth from this potential source . in this section",
    "we review their analysis methodology in anticipation of using it to determine the sensitivity of joint ligo / swift observations to the detectors relative orientation .",
    "consider a set of @xmath4 grb detections .",
    "assume that , as a result of each detection , we know the direction to the source @xmath5 and the arrival time @xmath6 of the burst at earth s barycenter .",
    "for our purposes , each grb observation is completely characterized by the pair @xmath7 .",
    "focus attention on a pair of gravitational - wave detectors located at positions @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) relative to earth s barycenter .",
    "the arrival time of grb @xmath10 at detector @xmath11 is @xmath12 in units where the speed of light @xmath13 is unity .",
    "@xcite note that the two ligo detectors are very nearly co - planar and co - aligned .",
    "consequently , a plane gravitational wave incident on the detector pair from the direction @xmath5 will lead to correlated detector responses with a time lag equal to @xmath14 to identify the presence of gwbs associated with grbs , @xcite focus attention on the correlated energy in the detector outputs corresponding to plane gwbs incident on the detectors from the direction of the corresponding grbs : i.e. , the correlation of the detector outputs at times that differ by @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the output of gravitational wave detector @xmath8 , which we assume to consist of detector noise @xmath17 and a possible gravitational wave signal @xmath18 _ produced by the grb source _ : in with @xmath19 . ]",
    "@xmath20 @xcite define @xmath21 as the energy in the cross - correlation of the two detectors corresponding to the grb characterized by @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath22 is a freely specifiable , symmetric filter function @xcite , and @xmath23 is chosen large enough to encompass the range of possible times by which the gravitational waves from a grb event may precede the gamma rays , which is typically thought to be of order 1 s for grbs produced by internal shocks and 100 s for grbs produced by external shocks @xcite .",
    "writing the detector output @xmath24 as the sum of the detector noise @xmath25 and the gravitational - wave signal @xmath26 associated with the grb we can , in turn , write @xmath27 where @xmath28 the terms @xmath29 in equation ( [ eq : s ] ) vanish in the mean over an ensemble of noise since the noise in our gravitational wave detector is uncorrelated with any gravitational wave signal .",
    "the term @xmath30 is , in the noise ensemble mean , a constant , which will be zero if the noise in the two detectors is uncorrelated .",
    "all four of the contributions to @xmath31 in equation ( [ eq : s ] ) are generally unknown for any particular grb",
    ". correspondingly , @xcite consider the collection @xmath32 of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and a second collection @xmath35 @xmath36 where each @xmath37 is constructed as in equation ( [ eq : cross ] ) but with a @xmath38 pair chosen randomly and not associated with a grb .",
    "the collections @xmath32 and @xmath35 are samples drawn from _",
    "populations _ @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the sample means @xmath41 and @xmath42 and variances @xmath43 and @xmath44 are estimates of the _ population means _",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 and variances @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "these are , in turn , related by @xmath49 where the overbar represents a mean over the population of grbs . comparing the two sample sets @xmath50 and @xmath35 thus provides a sensitive measure of the presence or absence of gravitational waves associated with grbs .",
    "when the detector noise is sufficiently well - behaved that terms like @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath30 are normally distributed the student @xmath3-test @xcite can be used to distinguish between the two sample sets ; in other cases a non - parametric test such as the mann - whitney test @xcite can be used .    in the student",
    "@xmath3-test the difference between the two distributions represented by the sample sets @xmath53 and @xmath54 is characterized by the @xmath3-statistic : @xmath55 if both @xmath56 and @xmath57 are drawn from same normal distribution then the distribution of @xmath58 is given by student s distribution with @xmath59 degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this distribution itself tends toward a normal distribution with unit variance when @xmath60 is large .",
    "now suppose that there is no gwb  grb association . in this event @xmath53 and @xmath54 are drawn from the same distribution and there is a number @xmath61 such that @xmath58 will be less than @xmath61 in a fraction @xmath62 of all observations of sample sets @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    ". will be positive semi - definite for the ligo detector pair if gravitational waves are associated with gamma - ray bursts . ]",
    "if , in our particular observation of @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath58 is less that @xmath61 then we accept the hypothesis that there are _ no _ gravitational - waves associated with gamma - ray bursts . if , on the other hand , we find @xmath58 greater than @xmath61 then we reject , with confidence @xmath62 , this hypothesis ; i.e. , we assert that there is an association of gravitational - waves with gamma - ray bursts .",
    "as described in the previous section , student s @xmath3-test tells us only if there is a link between gwbs and grbs .",
    "an alternative analysis , also described by @xcite , uses the @xmath3 statistic to derive a confidence interval or upper limit on the population - averaged gravitational - wave flux associated with grbs from a measured value @xmath58 of the @xmath3 statistic . in this analysis",
    "we derive the classical confidence interval or upper limit from the probability distribution @xmath63 of the @xmath3 statistic assuming that grbs radiate gwbs with intrinsic amplitude described by @xmath64 and other model parameters ( gravitational - wave burst luminosity function , burst characteristic , etc . )",
    "described by @xmath65 .    in the limit that the gwbs are weak relative to the sensitivity of the individual gravitational - wave detectors and the numbers of on- and off - source observations are separately large , @xcite showed that @xmath66 where @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the one - sided power spectral density of the @xmath69 detector , defined as @xmath70 @xmath71 is the average of @xmath72 over the grb population and the associated gwb luminosity function described by @xmath65 , @xmath73 is the normal distribution with mean @xmath74 and variance @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is the fourier transform of @xmath77 . for larger - amplitude grbs or different sample sizes ( e.g. ,  smaller number of grb observations )",
    "the distribution can be determined via monte carlo simulations .",
    "an observation of @xmath3 thus allows us to find a confidence limit on @xmath71 @xcite , which describes the flux of gravitational - waves on earth owing to grbs .",
    "the analysis described by @xcite assumed that the arms of the two ligo gravitational wave detectors all resided in the same plane , that pairs of arms were parallel to each other , and that the antenna pattern of the detectors was isotropic on the sky . in this section",
    "we relax all of these approximations : i.e. , we properly account for the position and orientation of the two ligo detectors on the earth and the dependence of their sensitivity to the direction to the grb source .",
    "our result is an expression for the dependence of the upper limit on population - averaged gravitational - wave strength @xmath78 as a function of the distribution of _ detected _ grbs on the sky . in section [ sec : fom ] we combine this result with the directional sensitivity of the swift detector to determine the dependence on swift pointing of the upper limit on @xmath78 that can be set by joint ligo / swift observations .",
    "the gravitational - wave component @xmath26 of the ligo detector output is , in the small antenna limit , a linear function of the physical gravitational - wave strain @xmath79 , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the gravitational - wave detector s location . for interferometer @xmath11 with arms pointing in the directions @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 ( with this normalization @xmath18 is equal to the fractional change in differential arm length . ) for gravitational wave bursts incident on the earth from direction @xmath85 , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is defined in terms of the direction to the source @xmath85 by equation ( [ eq : tn ] ) .",
    "we can thus ignore the physical separation of the detectors when computing the cross - correlation statistic ( cf .",
    "equation ( [ eq : cross ] ) ) .",
    "finally , it is convenient to resolve @xmath88 on the two polarization tensors @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 where @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 lacking any detailed model for the gravitational waves that may be produced in a grb event , we make the following assumptions about @xmath95 and @xmath96 :    * the waves have equal power in the two polarizations : @xmath97 * the two polarizations are uncorrelated : @xmath98    focus attention now on the mean gravitational - wave contribution @xmath78 to the @xmath3 statistic .",
    "this contribution depends on both the gravitational wave detector sensitivity to gwbs arriving from different directions as well as the gamma - ray bursts detector sensitivity to grbs from different directions ( which determines the relative number of bursts that will be observed from that direction ) . for gwbs arriving from the direction @xmath85 , @xmath99 where @xmath100 describes the direction - dependence of the sensitivity of the gravitational - wave detector pair to the gwb ( cf .",
    "equations ( [ eq : cross ] ) , ( [ eq : power ] ) , and ( [ eq : uncorrel ] ) ) .    to complete the evaluation of @xmath78 turn to the fraction of grb detections that arise from different patches on the sky .",
    "since the intrinsic grb population is isotropic , the distribution of detection on the sky depends entirely on the directional sensitivity of the grb detector .",
    "let the fraction of grb detections in a sky patch of area @xmath101 centered at @xmath85 be given by @xmath102 where the grb detector orientation is given by @xmath103 , the direction in which the detector is pointed , and @xmath104 , which describes the rotation of the satellite about its pointing direction .",
    "in terms of @xmath105 and @xmath106 the mean gravitational wave contribution @xmath78 to @xmath3 for a gamma - ray burst detector with fixed orientation @xmath107 is thus @xmath108\\left [ \\int_0^t\\!dt'\\!\\int_0^t\\!dt\\,q(t - t')h_{+}(t)h_{+}(t ' ) \\right]\\ ] ] the first bracketed term contains all the direction and orientation dependence of the gravitational wave and gamma - ray burst detectors , while the second term is strictly a property of the gravitational waves without reference to the orientation of the detectors .",
    "correspondingly , the sensitivity of the upper limit on gravitational wave strength averaged over the observed grb population when the orientation of gwb and the grb detectors are given by @xmath109 is proportional to @xmath110    satellite grb detectors orbit the earth and so their orientation is constantly changing ; similarly , the orientation of earth - based gravitational wave detectors are constantly changing as the earth rotates about its axis .",
    "the quantity @xmath78 will , in the end , involve the time average of @xmath111 over all these motions . since our principal purpose here is to evaluate the sensitivity of the grb / gwb detector array to gwbs from grbs as a function of the relative orientations of the detectors we focus on @xmath111 .",
    "clearly @xmath111 can be regarded as a figure of merit that describes how capable the gravitational - wave / gamma - ray burst detector combination is at identifying gwbs associated with grbs as a function of the detector orientations .",
    "this figure of merit may be normalized to have a maximum of unity ; however , regardless of the normalization @xmath112 is the ratio of the upper limits on the squared gravitational - wave amplitude that can be attained by orienting the grb satellite as @xmath113 versus @xmath114 . to the extent that , e.g.",
    ", the grb detector orientation @xmath113 can be manipulated on orbit , choosing orientations that maximize @xmath111 will lead to larger signal contributions to @xmath3 and thus more sensitive measurements of the gravitational wave strength associated with grbs .",
    "let us now consider the special case of the burst - alert telescope ( bat ) on the swift satellite and the ligo gravitational wave detectors @xcite .",
    "the bat is a wide field - of - view coded - aperture gamma - ray imager that will detect and locate grbs with arc - minute positional accuracy .",
    "its sensitivity to grbs depends on the the angle @xmath115 between the line of sight to the grb and the bat axis , as well as the rotational orientation of the satellite about the bat axis .",
    "averaged over this azimuthal angle , the bat sensitivity as a function of @xmath115 is approximately @xmath116 } &            \\lambda \\in [ 0,\\pi/3 ] \\ , , \\\\           0 & \\mbox{otherwise } \\ , .",
    "\\end{array }       \\right.\\ ] ] for the purposes of illustration we will use this azimuthal - angle averaged expression for the bat sensitivity .",
    "the second component of @xmath111 is the function @xmath117 , which depends on the projection of the gravitational - wave strain @xmath88 on to the gravitational - wave detector ( cf .",
    "equations ( [ eq : h ] ) and ( [ eq : hdecomp ] ) ) . to evaluate @xmath117 , introduce an earth - centered cartesian coordinate system , described by unit basis vectors @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , with    * @xmath120 pointing parallel to the earth s polar axis and in the direction of the north celestial pole , * @xmath118 parallel to the line that runs in the equatorial plane from earth s center to the intersection of the equator with the prime meridian at greenwich , and * @xmath119 chosen to form a right - handed coordinate system .",
    "similarly , we introduce the usual spherical - polar coordinate system , @xmath121 in these coordinates we write the gravitational wave polarization vectors as @xmath122 where to denote the direction _ to _ the grb / gwb source on the sky , rather than the propagation direction of the gwb .",
    "the net effect is @xmath123 in ( [ eq : m ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath124 similarly , denoting the detector projection tensor ( cf .",
    "equation ( [ eq : difo ] ) ) for the ligo hanford ( ligo livingston ) observatory detector by @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) we have @xcite @xmath127    figure  [ fig : ligo ] shows the antenna pattern @xmath105 ( [ eq : rholigo ] ) . since the two ligo detectors share nearly the same plane and have arms nearly aligned with each other their combined antenna pattern is very similar to that for a single interferometer . in particular , the lho / llo detector combination is most sensitive to radiation arriving from a direction orthogonal to the ( nearly common ) plane of the detector arms ( corresponding to the two peaks in figure  [ fig : ligo ] ) and least sensitive to radiation arriving in the detector arm plane and parallel to the ( nearly common ) arm bisector ( producing the four wells of low sensitivity in figure  [ fig : ligo ] ) .",
    "it is also precisely zero in certain directions .",
    "convolving @xmath105 with the swift sensitivity function @xmath128 as in equation ( [ eq : fom ] ) gives the figure of merit @xmath111 for the swift pointing , which is shown in figure  [ fig : fom ] .",
    "this plot is a smeared version of the ligo antenna pattern of figure  [ fig : ligo ] . in particular ,",
    "the four minima of the ligo sensitivity are smeared into two minima which are wider but not as deep .",
    "the figure of merit is nowhere zero , varying by a factor of approximately 4 between best ( near zenith of detectors ) and worst ( near planes of detectors at 45 degrees from arms ) orientations of swift .",
    "the all - sky average of the figure of merit is 0.56 times the maximum value .",
    "the currently accepted model for gamma - ray burst phenomena involves the violent formation of a rapidly rotating approximately solar mass black hole .",
    "gravitational waves should be associated with the black - hole formation , and their detection would permit this model to be tested , the black - hole progenitor ( e.g. , coalescing binary or collapsing stellar core ) to be identified , and the origin of the gamma rays ( within the expanding relativistic fireball or at the point of impact on the interstellar medium ) to be located . even upper limits on the gravitational - wave strength associated with gamma - ray bursts could constrain the gamma - ray burst model .",
    "we have evaluated how the quality of an upper limit on the gravitational - wave strength associated with gamma - ray burst observations depends on the relative orientation of the gamma - ray burst and gravitational - wave detectors , with particular application to the swift burst - alert telescope ( bat ) and the ligo gravitational wave detectors .",
    "setting aside other physical and science constraints on the swift mission , careful choice of bat pointing leads to an upper limit on the observed grb population - averaged mean - square gravitational - wave strength a factor of two lower than the upper limit resulting from pointing that does not take this science into account .",
    "there are , of course , numerous science and technical constraints that determine the pointing profile of a satellite like swift ; correspondingly , even in the most optimistic case the ratio of the best possible upper limit to the best attainable upper limit will be reduced from this factor of two .",
    "nevertheless , when it can be done without jeopardizing other mission objectives there is an advantage to optimizing the pointing of swift to maximize the joint ligo / swift sensitivity to gamma - ray burst systems .",
    "the pointing dependent part ( cf .",
    "equation ( [ eq : fom ] ) ) of the anticipated upper limit that can be set with these joint observations , suitably normalized , is closely related to the science enabled by joint ligo / swift observations and constitutes an excellent `` figure - of - merit '' that can be used to incorporate this objective in swift mission planning .",
