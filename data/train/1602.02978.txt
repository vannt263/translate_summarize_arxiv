    "transition metal compounds containing heavy 5@xmath3 atoms are often governed by spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , electronic correlations , and crystal field effects of comparable strength @xcite .",
    "the relativistic entanglement of correlated orbital and spin degrees of freedom in such materials can drive exotic quantum states of matter , such as effective @xmath4  @xmath5  1/2 mott insulators @xcite , topological superconductors and insulators @xcite , and quantum spin liquids @xcite .",
    "the research community has placed a great deal of emphasis on 5@xmath6 systems due to the extreme quantum nature of the novel effective @xmath4  @xmath5  1/2 state associated with that particular @xmath3-electron configuration . on the other hand ,",
    "far less work has focused on 5@xmath7 - 5@xmath8 materials even though strong soc may play a key role in determining their magnetic properties .",
    "double perovskites ( dps ) of the form @xmath9o@xmath2 , with magnetic 4@xmath3 or 5@xmath3 @xmath10 ions , provide an outstanding opportunity to investigate the interplay of soc , structural distortions , and @xmath3-electron configuration on the magnetism of the geometrically - frustrated face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) lattice @xcite .",
    "hundreds of dps have now been synthesized in polycrystalline form , and subsequent characterization work revealed a diverse array of magnetic properties .",
    "the @xmath11 dps that have been studied in detail , including la@xmath1mgiro@xmath2 and la@xmath1zniro@xmath2 , are effective @xmath4  @xmath5  1/2 candidates @xcite that exhibit antiferromagnetic ground states and interesting magnetic excitations @xcite .",
    "materials composed of magnetic ions with 4@xmath12/5@xmath12 electron configurations generally host ordered magnetic ground states also @xcite . aside from a few",
    "known exceptions @xcite , the spin arrangements in @xmath12 systems are usually well - accounted for by mean field theory , with ground state selection arising from the signs and magnitudes of the nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor exchange interactions @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic order of 4@xmath12/5@xmath12 and 5@xmath6 systems often gives way to exotic magnetic states in 4@xmath7/5@xmath7 quantum spin dps .",
    "for example , ba@xmath1ymoo@xmath2 has been described as a valence bond glass with a collective spin - singlet ground state @xcite and sr@xmath13reo@xmath2 ( @xmath14  @xmath5  mg , ca ) are best characterized as unconventional spin glasses , since no obvious source of disorder has been found @xcite .",
    "the magnetism of heavy metal @xmath0 dps serves as an interesting intermediate case between the @xmath7 and @xmath12/@xmath6 analogues , and recent theoretical work has established a phase diagram for the cubic limit @xcite .",
    "while there are currently no experimental examples of 4@xmath0 dps , previous work on 5@xmath0 systems has found evidence for both long - range ordered and alternative ground states .",
    "for example , a low - moment , long - range antiferromagnetic ground state has been reported for ba@xmath1caoso@xmath2 @xcite , spin freezing without signs of long - range magnetic order ( i.e. spin glass ) has been found for ca@xmath1mgoso@xmath2 @xcite and ba@xmath1yreo@xmath2 @xcite , and a non - magnetic singlet ground state was proposed for srlamgreo@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "there are also many other 5@xmath0 dps that have not been characterized in detail .",
    "for example , there is no work on the magnetism of sr@xmath1yreo@xmath2 , and only one report on sr@xmath1inreo@xmath2 that presents extremely limited information about its magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "there is currently no consensus on the factors that contribute to ground state selection or their order of importance for 5@xmath0 dps . in this work , we make progress towards addressing this issue .",
    "we first revisit the crystal structures of the largely unexplored , 5@xmath0 monoclinic dps sr@xmath1yreo@xmath2 and sr@xmath1inreo@xmath2 with neutron powder diffraction and find that both systems crystallize in the _ p@xmath15/n _ space group with minimal @xmath16 site mixing .",
    "we then determine the magnetic ground states of these systems with a combination of magnetic susceptibility , heat capacity , neutron powder diffraction , and muon spin relaxation .",
    "our combined measurements suggest that sr@xmath1yreo@xmath2 is a spin glass , while sr@xmath1inreo@xmath2 hosts a non - magnetic singlet ground state . by making extensive comparisons between sr@xmath1yreo@xmath2 , sr@xmath1inreo@xmath2 , other 5@xmath0 dps , and ni@xmath17 @xmath18  @xmath5  1 dps",
    ", we propose that the diverse magnetic ground states of the 5@xmath0 family arise from the combined effects of enhanced soc , exchange interactions , and the great sensitivity of this particular @xmath3 electron configuration to even modest structural distortions .",
    "polycrystalline sr@xmath19reo@xmath2 ( @xmath14  @xmath5  y and in ) samples were synthesized by a conventional solid state reaction method .",
    "the starting materials of sro , y@xmath1o@xmath20 ( or in@xmath1o@xmath20 ) , re and re@xmath1o@xmath21 powders were weighed in an appropriate ratio and mixed thoroughly inside of a dry he glovebox .",
    "the homogeneous mixture was pelletized and transfered to a 5  ml al@xmath1o@xmath20 crucible .",
    "the al@xmath1o@xmath20 crucible was then sealed in a vacuum quartz tube backfilled with 1/3 atmosphere of high purity ar .",
    "the ampoule was fired in a box furnace at 900@xmath22c for 48 hours .",
    "the fired pellets were reground , repelletized and then fired in a sealed quartz tube for another 100 hours .",
    "room temperature x - ray powder diffraction was performed on a panalytical xpert pro mpd powder x - ray diffractometer using cu k@xmath23 radiation and confirmed that the samples were of single phase .",
    "the dc magnetic susceptibilities were measured between 2 - 350 k using a quantum design ( qd ) magnetic property measurement system .",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat was measured between 2 - 200 k using a qd physical property measurement system .",
    "neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) experiments were performed with 10  g of sr@xmath1yreo@xmath2 and 10  g of sr@xmath1inreo@xmath2 at oak ridge national laboratory using the hb-2a powder diffractometer of the high flux isotope reactor .",
    "data was collected with neutron wavelengths of @xmath24  @xmath5  1.54    with collimation 12-21-12 and @xmath24  @xmath5  2.41    with collimation 12-open-12. the shorter wavelength provides greater intensity and higher @xmath25 coverage that was used to investigate the crystal structures , while the longer wavelength provides the lower @xmath25 coverage required for magnetic diffraction .",
    "the @xmath26sr experiments were performed at the isis pulsed neutron and muon source , uk .",
    "we used the emu and musr spectrometers in longitudinal geometry for investigating sr@xmath1inreo@xmath2 ( closed cycle refrigerator , base @xmath27  @xmath5  7.5  k ) and sr@xmath1yreo@xmath2 ( he - flow cryostat , base @xmath27  @xmath5  1.4  k ) respectively . the time - evolution of the spin polarization of the muon ensemble was measured via the asymmetry function , @xmath28 @xcite .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the acronyms for the magnetic ground states specified in the table mean the following : af ( antiferromagnet ) , aflro ( unknown antiferromagnetic long - range order ) , no lro ( no long - range order detected ) , sg ( spin glass ) , ss ( non - magnetic singlet state ) . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are both presented in k.    the enhanced sensitivity of 5@xmath3 systems to small structural distortions , as compared to their 3@xmath3 counterparts , arises from the spatially - extended nature of the 5@xmath3 orbitals .",
    "we propose here that this difference is one of the key factors leading to a wide variation of magnetic ground states for 5@xmath0 dps . if @xmath34  @xmath5  0 , which is valid for cubic systems , then the five - fold degeneracy of the @xmath4  @xmath5  2 multiplet will be preserved and a long - range ordered magnetic ground state will be the most common outcome @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the intramultiplet splitting @xmath34 for the non - cubic systems becomes significant and creates a singlet ground state , there are three main possibilities based on the strength of the exchange interactions @xmath35 between the magnetic ions .",
    "it is well - known that there is a critical value @xmath36",
    "@xmath5  ( @xmath35/@xmath34)@xmath37 above which magnetic moments are induced in singlet systems @xcite and typical long - range magnetic order can still arise . on the other hand , for @xmath36  @xmath38  @xmath35/@xmath34 , spontaneous magnetism becomes impossible and therefore non - magnetic singlet ground states are realized instead .",
    "the third case with @xmath36  @xmath39  @xmath35/@xmath34 proposed for the spin glass prau@xmath1si@xmath1 is perhaps the most interesting , as it has been suggested that the spin freezing results from dynamic fluctuations of the crystal - field levels that destabilize the induced moments and frustrate the development of long - range magnetic order @xcite .",
    "this mechanism can serve as the source of both the frustration and disorder that are generally accepted to be essential ingredients in all spin glasses , and it can provide a natural explanation for why no obvious source of disorder has ever been found in 5@xmath0 spin glass dps .",
    "magnetic characterization studies of 5@xmath0 dps yield results that are broadly consistent with our explanation given above for magnetic ground state selection .",
    "we first consider sr@xmath1yreo@xmath2 and sr@xmath1inreo@xmath2 , which were extensively characterized in the present work .",
    "the re@xmath40 sites of both systems are subjected to non - cubic crystal fields ; this deviation from ideal fcc lattice geometry simultaneously enhances @xmath34 and reduces @xmath35 .",
    "one way to roughly quantify the former effect is by considering re - o bond lengths . at @xmath27  @xmath5",
    "4  k , our npd measurements yield three inequivalent re - o bond lengths of 1.95 , 1.96 , and 1.98    and 1.94 , 1.97 , and 2.01    for the y and in systems respectively . the latter effect can also be quantified by considering the magnitude of the curie - weiss temperatures @xmath32 .",
    "based on the significantly reduced value of @xmath32 coupled with the enhanced structural distortion for sr@xmath1inreo@xmath2 relative to sr@xmath1yreo@xmath2 , it is not surprising for a @xmath4  @xmath5  0 single ion ground state to arise for the former but not for the latter .    in general",
    ", table iii indicates that 5@xmath0 systems with low curie - weiss temperatures and significant structural distortions tend to exhibit singlet ground states , while cubic systems show an increased tendency for magnetic order .",
    "ba@xmath1yreo@xmath2 is the one known example of a cubic 5@xmath0 system that does not show long - range order , although broad , magnetic bragg peaks were recently observed that are characteristic of type i af short - range order or a cluster spin glass @xcite . furthermore , it is possible that ba@xmath1yreo@xmath2 is not an ideal fcc system but rather exhibits a small structural distortion that can best be observed by synchrotron x - ray diffraction .    finally , we note that our discussion for 5@xmath0 systems does not extend to 4@xmath7/5@xmath7 systems since they can not have single ion singlet ground states according to kramer s theorem .",
    "on the basis of enhanced quantum fluctuations and strong geometric frustration , theoretical work for @xmath7 systems predicts that exotic collective spin - singlet ground states including quantum spin liquids and valence bond solids / glasses can be realized @xcite .",
    "while we can not rule out similar origins for the singlet ground states in 5@xmath0 dps , previous theoretical work on these systems indicates that simple ordered states dominate the phase diagram instead @xcite .",
    "we have performed detailed characterization studies of the 5@xmath0 double perovskites sr@xmath1inreo@xmath2 and sr@xmath1yreo@xmath2 .",
    "both systems crystallize in the space group _ p@xmath15/n _ and therefore non - cubic crystal fields are present at the re@xmath40 sites .",
    "our combined magnetic susceptibility , heat capacity , neutron powder diffraction , and muon spin relaxation measurements suggest that sr@xmath1yreo@xmath2 is a spin glass while sr@xmath1inreo@xmath2 is best characterized by a non - magnetic singlet ground state .",
    "we attribute the great diversity of magnetic ground states found for the 5@xmath0 double perovskite family , including the different ground states for sr@xmath1yreo@xmath2 and sr@xmath1inreo@xmath2 determined in this work , to a subtle interplay between spin - orbit coupling , non - cubic crystal fields , and exchange interactions . to verify our hypothesis for ground state selection in 5@xmath0 systems",

    "<S> we have performed magnetic susceptibility , heat capacity , neutron powder diffraction , and muon spin relaxation experiments to investigate the magnetic ground states of the 5@xmath0 double perovskites sr@xmath1yreo@xmath2 and sr@xmath1inreo@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that sr@xmath1yreo@xmath2 is a spin glass , while sr@xmath1inreo@xmath2 hosts a non - magnetic singlet state . by making detailed comparisons with other 5@xmath0 double perovskites </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that a delicate interplay between spin - orbit coupling , non - cubic crystal fields , and exchange interactions plays a key role in the great variation of magnetic ground states observed for this family of materials . </S>"
