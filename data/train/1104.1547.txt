    "the magnetic chemically peculiar ( mcp ) star @xmath0  cvn ( hd  112413 , hr  4915 ) was the first bright star ( @xmath5  =  2.90 ) classified as chemically peculiar of the sihgeucr   type ( leckrone  1973 ) and is the prototypical magnetic cp star .",
    "this star shows periodic spectrum , magnetic field and light variations with a period of 5.46939 days first established by farnsworth  ( 1932 ) . in the visual spectral region",
    "the light curves for @xmath0  cvn have been presented by provin  ( 1953 ) . in addition , twenty - one @xmath6 photometric observations of this star were also obtained by pyper  ( 1969 ) .",
    "molnar  ( 1973 ) investigated the ultraviolet photometric observations with -2 satellite for @xmath0  cvn .",
    "he showed that the light variations in the wavelength region shorter than @xmath7  2960    are generally in anti - phase to the light variations in the visual region , although the shapes of light curves are different .",
    "moreover , the photometric light curves indicate that there are two important sources of energy blocking in the far - uv region .",
    "strong line blanketing by the rare earths redistributes flux into the paschen continuum , causing the major observed photometric variations . in addition , a second source , which may be due to a combination of continuous opacities and blanketing from the iron - peak and rare - earth groups below @xmath2  1600   , apparently redistributes flux into the region of the balmer discontinuity .",
    "leckrone & snijders  ( 1979 ) have been studied the ultraviolet spectrophotometry obtained with @xmath8 , -2 , @xmath9 - 1 and a sounding rocket for @xmath0  cvn .",
    "the authors compared the ultraviolet flux distribution at two phases 0.0 and 0.5 and they pointed out that : ( 1 ) at @xmath2  @xmath10  1190   , the flux varies with large amplitude appears to result from enhanced continuous opacity sources , ( 2 ) variations in the 11901365    range are due primarily to lines of doubly ionized metals and possibly of si  ii , and ( 3 ) from 1365 to 1800    and from 2700 to 2900  fluxes does not vary in any systematic way .",
    "one can see that the variations of the ultraviolet fluxes are quite complex and it is necessary to investigate the variations of the ultraviolet fluxes at different phases of the rotational cycle for this star .    the light variability can be generally explained by the variable abundance of several chemical elements observed in the atmospheres of mcp  stars . enhanced energy blocking decreases the flux in the far - uv region where most of the lines of these elements are present .",
    "the blocked flux re - emerges in the visual and the red parts of the spectrum .",
    "such an explanation is supported by the anti - phase relationship of light curves in the far - uv and the visual spectral regions .",
    "in addition , this relationship asserts the existence of the null wavelength region where the amplitude of light variations is zero over the period of rotation ( see , for example , leckrone  1974 ; molnar  1975 ; molnar et al .",
    "1976 ; jamar  1978 ) .",
    "earlier photometric results obtained for some mcp  stars show the existence of two or more null wavelength regions ( jamar  1977 ; muciek et al .  1985 ) . later , sokolov  ( 2000 , 2006 , 2010 ) investigated the spectrophotometric variability of two silicon mcp stars cu  vir and 56  ari in the far - uv spectral region , using the archival data .",
    "the author showed that in the case of cu  vir the null wavelength region is at @xmath2  2000   , but in the case of 56  ari with more complex light curves null wavelength region is not exists .",
    "detailed investigation of several additional stars is necessary to draw a definite conclusion about the mechanism of light variations in the spectra of mcp stars .",
    "another mcp star is @xmath0  cvn for which there are enough data in order to investigate the spectrophotometric variability in the ultraviolet spectral region .",
    "the newly extracted spectra ( ines ) data from the satellite allows to investigate the variability of the monochromatic light curves in the far - uv and near - uv spectral regions .",
    "the ines archive are available from the ines principal center website http://ines.vilspa.esa.es or from the ines national hosts wamsteker  ( 2000 ) .    in this paper , the low - dispersion spectra of mcp star @xmath0  cvn",
    "are analyzed in detail the variability of the monochromatic light curves in the far - uv and near - uv spectral regions , using the ines data from the satellite .",
    "the following list of a series of two observations of @xmath0  cvn obtained with short wavelength prime ( swp ) , long wavelength redundant ( lwr ) and long wavelength prime ( lwp ) cameras was received from the ines archive .    1 .",
    "the first one contains 10 swp spectra and 8 lwr spectra obtained in december 1981 ; 2 .",
    "the second one contains 11 swp and 7 lwp spectra obtained in march 1984 .    additionally ,",
    "four spectra ( swp  04812 , swp  04813 , lwr  02674 , lwr  04153 ) obtained in october 1978 and march 1979 were received from the ines archive as well . in all cases ,",
    "the spectra were obtained through the large aperture ( 9.5@xmath11  @xmath12  22@xmath11 ) .    in the ines archive ,",
    "each high - dispersion image has an associated rebinned spectrum , which is obtained by rebinning the concatenated spectrum at the same wavelength step size ( 1.676   / pixel for swp camera and 2.669   / pixel for lwr and lwp cameras ) as low - resolution data ( gonzlez - riestra et al .",
    "this data set represents an important complement to the low - resolution archive , and it is especially useful for time - variability studies .",
    "the ultraviolet spectra used in this study are low - resolution echelle spectra obtained with a resolution of about 6   .",
    "additionally , the rebinned spectra from high - dispersion images of @xmath0  cvn were used , as well .",
    "the inspection of the spectra of @xmath0  cvn showed that the fluxes of the swp  27838 spectrum systematically lower and unsuitable for our purpose .",
    "additionally , the high - dispersion spectrum lwp  07741 was excluded , because the exposure time is only 2.184 sec .",
    "finally , we analyzed 22 swp , 10 lwr and 6 lwp spectra , distributed quite smoothly over the period of rotation .      since the beginning of the 20th century till now ( e.g. , romanyuk et al .",
    "2007 ) the investigators use the ephemeris obtained of farnsworth  ( 1932 ) , which refers to the phase of the maximum intensity of eu  ii spectral lines . on the other hand",
    ", some mcp stars displayed an increase their rotational periods ( mikulasek et al .",
    "unfortunately , in literature there are not the photometric data , except of the @xmath6 photometric observations obtained by pyper  ( 1969 ) .",
    "other publications concerning the photometric observations of @xmath0  cvn are not available as they are published only as plots . in order to check the trustiness of the ephemeris obtained of farnsworth  ( 1932 ) we used the photometric data from hipparcos ( esa  1997 ) .",
    "the hipparcos epoch photometry contains 107 measurements of @xmath0  cvn obtained between julian dates : 2447896 - 2449018 .",
    "the hipparcos photometry ( h@xmath13 ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ hip_ph ] versus the phase computed by means of farnsworth  ( 1932 ) ephemeris : @xmath14 we find a cosinusoidal variations of h@xmath13 with an amplitude of the order of 0.06  mag , although the scattering of h@xmath13 measurements around the fitted curve are significant .",
    "the mean standard deviations of the residual scatter around the fitted curve ( @xmath15 ) is equal to 0.018  mag .",
    "probably , such scattering of h@xmath13 measurements can be explained by the influence of @xmath16  cvn on the h@xmath13 data of @xmath0  cvn at the passband of hipparcos photometry . the pair @xmath0  cvn and @xmath16  cvn is a visual binary with a separation of 20@xmath11 .",
    "the secondary is the spectral class f0  v and @xmath5  =  5.60 . in any case , the maximum and the minimum of the fitted h@xmath13 light curve correspond to the phases 0.0 and 0.5 , respectively .",
    "it is in the good agreement with the @xmath17 light curve ( see fig .  1 of pyper  1969 ) .",
    "solid lines denote the fit according to equation  [ equation_2].,width=396 ]",
    "to analyze the spectra of @xmath0  cvn we used the linearized least - squares method .",
    "an attempt was made to describe the light curves in a quantitative way by adjusting a fourier series .",
    "the method has already applied to the data of two silicon mcp stars cu  vir and 56  ari and has shown the very good descriptions of the monochromatic light curves ( sokolov  2000 , 2006 , 2010 ) . in the case of @xmath0",
    "cvn the observations were fitted by a simple cosine wave : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a flux for the given @xmath2 and the @xmath20 is julian date of the observation .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 are zero epoch and rotational period of the ephemeris , respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath23 of the fitted curves define the average distribution of energy over the cycle of the variability while the coefficients @xmath24 define the semi - amplitude of the flux variations for the given @xmath2 . from several scans distributed over the period one can produce light curves at different wavelengths .",
    "this procedure can be partially accounted for by considering that within the accuracy of the measurements a cosine wave appear to be generally adequate to describe the monochromatic light curves in the ultraviolet spectral region .",
    "the least - squares fit was applied to the separate monochromatic light curves .",
    "an error analysis showed that the uncertainties in the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the fitted curves not more 0.05 and 0.07 , respectively .",
    "although , the standard deviations of the residual scatter around the fitted curves ( @xmath15 ) varies from 0.03 to 0.18 in the investigated wavelengths .",
    "the maximal errors of the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 as well as in @xmath15 are in the blue and red parts of spectra .",
    "probably , it is connected with uncertainties of the fluxes in both ends of spectra , as presented in ines database .",
    "thus , we limited our investigation to the wavelength region from 1150 to 1950  and from 1950 to 3200    for far - uv and near - uv spectral regions , respectively . in order to minimize the uncertainties in the coefficients of the fitted curves , the light curves were determined by averaging three nearest fluxes for a given @xmath2 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is equal 1.676    for swp camera and is equal 2.669  for lwr and lwp cameras .",
    "as far as the errors in @xmath27 are concerned , we computed them by taking into account the the errors in the fluxes as presented in ines @xmath28 , according to the standard propagation theory of errors .",
    "figure  [ mean ] displays the average energy distribution @xmath29 of @xmath0  cvn over the cycle of the variability in the spectral region from 1150 to 3200   .",
    "first of all , it is necessary to fix the continuum in the low - dispersion data .",
    "this is very difficult in the uv due to the lines crowding .",
    "nevertheless , one can find some high flux points located at the same wavelength in several spectra of @xmath0  cvn .",
    "it should be noted that such choice of the continuum might be a pseudo - continuum. however , there is no chance to reach the true continuum , if it occurs at high flux points . from several scans distributed over the period of rotation",
    "one can produce light curves in different wavelengths .",
    "the light curves discussed below will be called monochromatic , although they were determined by averaging three nearest fluxes for a given @xmath2 according to equation  [ equation_3 ] .",
    "several monochromatic light curves in the pseudo - continuum at different wavelengths were formed .",
    "the examples of light curves together with the fitted cosine curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ mono_light ] .",
    "note the vertical scales differ for each part of the figure . in order to exclude overlapping of some curves the vertical shift on the constant value was used . in this way",
    ", the curves at @xmath1  2649 , 2993 and 3015    were shifted down to the values of -1.5 , -0.5 and -1.0  @xmath12  , respectively . on the other hand , the curves at @xmath1  2097 and 2505",
    "were shifted up to the values of + 0.5 and + 1.0  @xmath12  , respectively .",
    "the monochromatic light curves in the pseudo - continuum of @xmath0  cvn change their shape with wavelength .",
    "all light curves with @xmath2  @xmath3  2505    have a similar shape : a minimum of the flux at phase 0.0 and a maximum of the flux at phase 0.5 .",
    "on the other hand , the monochromatic light curves with @xmath2  @xmath4  2505  shows the phase displacement of the minimum from 0.0 at @xmath2  2505    to 0.3 at @xmath2  2993   .",
    "the maximum also moves from the phase 0.5 at @xmath2  2505    to the phase 0.8 at @xmath2  2993   .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of light variations decreases with increasing wavelength and , as a result , at @xmath2  @xmath4  2993    there is the null wavelength region , where the amplitude of light variations is zero over the period of rotation .",
    "our result is in the agreement with previous investigation of molnar  ( 1973 ) obtained from the ultraviolet photometric observations with -2 satellite for @xmath0  cvn .",
    "it is necessary to note that the amplitude of light variations can also changes in the spectral region with @xmath2@xmath3  2505   , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ mono_light ] .        [ amplitude ]",
    "the situation with position of null wavelength region in the spectrum of @xmath0  cvn is enough mysterious .",
    "thus , molnar  ( 1973 ) had determined the position of the null wavelength region at @xmath7  2960   . on the other hand , leckrone & snijders  ( 1979 )",
    "find that null wavelength region extends short wavelength to about 2700   .",
    "moreover , they have noted that from 1365 to at least 1800    and from 2700 to at least 2900  , @xmath0  cvn does not vary in any systematic way .",
    "the ines data from the satellite allows to estimate more accurately the position of the null wavelength region in the spectrum of this star . in order to investigate behavior of the monochromatic light curves in the pseudo - continuum of @xmath0  cvn we used the coefficients @xmath24 ( semi - amplitude of the flux variations ) .",
    "figure  [ mono_light ] presents the dependence of the amplitude of the light curves from wavelength .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ mono_light ] that the variations of the amplitudes of light curves is quite complex .",
    "the maximal values of the amplitudes are reached in the spectral regions @xmath1  12811294 , 13141360 , 1500 , 2048 , 2219 , 2275 , 2420 and 2505   . on the other hand ,",
    "the minimal values of the amplitudes are in the spectral region from 1660 to 1900    as well as in the region with @xmath2  @xmath4  2993   .",
    "also , the minimal values of the amplitude are reached at the cores of the large features at @xmath1  1560 and 1770   and at the cores of the strong si  ii resonance lines at @xmath1  126064 , 130409 and 1485   . moreover , the minimal values of the amplitude are at the cores of the fe  ii depression at @xmath1  172531 and 2250   .    in order to establish the position of the null wavelength region in the spectral region with @xmath2  @xmath4  2993    the amplitudes of the light variations in the pseudo - continuum have been used .",
    "the inspection of the values of amplitudes at this spectral regions showed that within the errors of measurements the fluxes are not varies in the spectral region from 3015 to 3138  , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ null_reg ] . in other words ,",
    "the brightness of the star at this spectral region is constant over the period of rotation which means that the so called null wavelength region exist on these wavelengths .",
    "for the first time , molnar  ( 1973 ) investigated the photometric variability of @xmath0  cvn in the far - uv spectral region using the photometric data obtained with -2 satellite .",
    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to compare the phase diagrams obtained from the photometric data with our phase diagrams , because the -2 photometric filters had fwhm  @xmath30  200  (code et al .  1970 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the satellite performed uv spectrophotometry in the low - resolution mode with spectral resolution @xmath316   .",
    "although , there is some evidence for the phase displacement of minimum of the flux at @xmath1  1332 , 1430 and 1554    by obtained from the photometric data in the far - uv spectral region .",
    "these have a very strong minimum of the flux at phase 0.1 and a secondary minimum at phase 0.5 .",
    "however , this latter feature is not very evident at @xmath2  1554   .",
    "perhaps the minimum of the flux at phase 0.1 is related to the maximum of the light curves at phase 0.1 for the light curve at @xmath2  3317    and the light curves in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 filters ( see fig .  1 and 2 of molnar  1973 ) .",
    "molnar  ( 1973 ) had indicated that there are two important sources in the blocking of the emergent flux in the far - uv spectral region .",
    "strong blanketing by the rare - earths elements ( ree ) redistributes flux into the visual spectral region .",
    "in addition , a second source , which may be due to a combination of continuous opacities and line blanketing from the iron - peak and rare - earth groups below @xmath2  1600   .",
    "leckrone & snijders  ( 1979 ) noted that the complex shapes of molnar s far - uv light curves can be understood in terms of the competition between cr , fe and si lines , which vary out of phase with the ree lines , and ti , mn and v , which vary approximately in phase with the ree lines .",
    "solid lines denote the fit according to equation  [ equation_2].,width=340 ]    probably , an uneven surface distribution of chromium , silicon and iron mainly influence on the flux redistribution from the far - uv to the visual spectral regions in the spectrum of @xmath0  cvn , although an additional sources of opacity can be involved .",
    "it is not new that chromium , silicon and iron influence on the flux redistribution in the spectra of mcp stars .",
    "khan & shulyak  ( 2007 ) have studied the effects of individual abundance patterns on the model atmospheres of mcp stars .",
    "they have shown that the group of elements which produce large changes in the model atmosphere structure and energy distribution mainly consists of silicon , iron and chromium . it should be noted that lines of these elements are widely presented in spectra of mcp stars in the far - uv spectral region .",
    "recently , krticka et al .  (",
    "2009 ) have simulated the light variability of the star hr  7224 using the observed surface distribution of silicon and iron .",
    "they have concluded that a promising explanation for the light variations in mcp stars is a flux redistribution through line and bound - free transitions combined with the inhomogeneous surface distribution of various elements .",
    "our investigation indicate that the variations of the monochromatic light curves in the pseudo - continuum of @xmath0  cvn are more complex . for example , the monochromatic light curves with @xmath2  @xmath4  2505    shows the phase displacement of the minimum .",
    "moreover , the minimal values of the amplitude are reached at the cores of the large features at @xmath1  1560 and 1770   and at the cores of the strong si  ii resonance lines at @xmath1  126064 , 130409 and 1485   .",
    "also , the minimal values of the amplitude are at the cores of the fe  ii depressions at @xmath1  172531 and 2250   .",
    "possibly , an additional investigation the variations of the flux at the cores of the large features and spectral lines will help to understand such behavior of the light curves in the spectrum of @xmath0  cvn .",
    "it are given in the next paper by sokolov  ( 2011 ) .",
