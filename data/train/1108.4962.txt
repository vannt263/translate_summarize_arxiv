    "its reappearance in a modern context is related to the discovery of hamiltonian mondromy by cushman and duistermat @xcite .",
    "this non - trivial global property of the actions and the rotation number of the spherical pendulum has not been noted in the classical treatment .",
    "the non - trivial topology of certain torus bundles in the spherical pendulum is best understood with the help of singular reduction , and the detailed treatment of the spherical pendulum in this formalism is given in @xcite .",
    "within the context of kam theory the frequency map of the system was shown to be non - degenerate for all regular values of the energy - momentum map by horozov @xcite ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "later in @xcite horozov showed that the frequency ratio map does have singularities , so that the isoenergetic non - degeneracy condition of the kam theorem fails on codimension one curves of non - critical values in the image of the energy - momentum map @xmath0 .",
    "the hamiltonian monodromy has also been studied from a complex analytic point of view in @xcite and @xcite .    in view of",
    "these works the spherical pendulum is one of the best understood liouville integrable systems . in this article",
    "we want to add to this knowledge the semi - global symplectic invariants of the focus - focus point of the spherical pendulum , and the expansion of its rotation number and period near this point in terms of the invariant and the birkhoff normal form .",
    "well known smooth invariants of a dynamical system are the eigenvalues at an equilibrium point , which are invariant under smooth coordinate transformations . for liouville",
    "integrable hamiltonians the local symplectic classification of non - degenerate singularities was given by eliasson in @xcite .",
    "more global invariants have also been considered .",
    "there are bolsinov s orbital invariants @xcite which are invariant under smooth conjugacy . using these",
    "it was shown that the flow of the euler top is @xmath1 orbitally equivalent to the geodesic flow on some ellipsoid @xcite . moreover ,",
    "this equivalence can not be made @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "related results on @xmath3 equivalence of divergence free vector fields are given in @xcite .",
    "restricting to smooth symplectic coordinate transformations the corresponding invariants ( in one degree of freedom ) were introduced by dufour , molino and toulet @xcite .",
    "the semi - global symplectic invariants for the liouville foliation of a liouville integrable hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom in the neighbourhood of the separatrix of a simple focus - focus point were introduced by vu ngoc @xcite , and for hyperbolic - hyperbolic equilibria by dullin and vu ngoc @xcite .",
    "the latter paper also contains and explicit calculations of semi - global symplectic invariants near a hyperbolic - hyperbolic equilibrium .",
    "consider two liouville integrable systems on the manifold @xmath4 with symplectic structure @xmath5 and with energy - momentum maps @xmath6 , each with a simple focus - focus point .",
    "if these integrable systems have the same semi - global symplectic invariants at the focus - focus point then there is a symplectic map @xmath7 in a full neighbourhood of the separatrix of the focus - focus point and a map @xmath8 reparameterizing the integrals such that @xmath9 the invariants are given as the coefficients of the power series of the analytic part of the singular action expressed as a function of certain regular actions . coincidence of the invariants is a necessary condition that the systems can be globally equivalent in the sense of .",
    "the coincidence of these invariants is also a necessary condition for the corresponding quantum systems to have the same eigenfunctions .",
    "the eigenvalues do not enter this description .",
    "the classical analogue of this statement is that the hamiltonian or the second integral can be changed with the function @xmath10 without changing the invariants . when considering a weaker notion of equivalence which does not allow the transformation @xmath10 then the additional invariants are the coefficients of the ( simultaneous ) birkhoff normal form of @xmath0 .",
    "the main objects in the classification are two different kinds of actions .",
    "first of all the standard canonical action with its singular behaviour near a separatrix is essential .",
    "but in addition also `` imaginary actions '' which are sometimes associated with the quantum mechanical tunnelling play a crucial role . in the spherical pendulum",
    "they are given as complete elliptic integrals over cycles @xmath11 and @xmath12 that form a basis of cycles on the corresponding complex torus .",
    "it turns out that the imaginary actions are intimately related to the birkhoff normal form near an unstable equilibrium point , more precisely they are the eliasson coordinates defined in a neighbourhood of the equilibrium . the key idea for the construction of the semi - global symplectic invariants",
    "is to express the regularised canonical action as a function of the imaginary action . in this way naturally a symplectic invariant is obtained that is independent of the hamiltonian .    in @xcite the information contained in the transformation of the hamiltonian into normal form @xcite combined with the semi - global symplectic invariants @xcite where used to find the form of the frequency ratio map near a simple focus - focus point . here",
    "we apply the general theory to the spherical pendulum , and we show how the two essential power series , the hamiltonian in terms of eliasson s coordinates and the semi - global symplectic invariant contained in the action , can actually be computed using a combination of adapted lie - series normal form and classical analysis of elliptic integrals of the third kind . as a special case",
    "the semi - global symplectic invariants of the ordinary pendulum are found .",
    "we show that these invariants are given by the power series of jacobi s nome in terms of the imaginary action .    to our knowledge",
    "the present work gives the first example where the semi - global symplectic invariants near a focus - focus point are calculated explicitly for a particular system .",
    "we hope that other systems will be added to the list , so that this will lead the way to a classification of liouville integrable systems .",
    "the spherical pendulum is a point of mass @xmath13 constrained to move on a sphere under the influence of gravity .",
    "let @xmath14 be a point on the sphere @xmath15 of radius @xmath16 where the norm is induced by the standard euclidean scalar product @xmath17 . instead of the usual ( singular )",
    "spherical coordinates on the sphere here we start with a global description that is free of coordinate singularities . with @xmath18 being the force of gravity , newton s equations of motion are @xmath19 and the lagrange multiplier @xmath20 is @xmath21 determined such that @xmath22",
    ". the initial condition must satisfy @xmath23 in order to be contained in the tangent space of the sphere .",
    "the system has global hamiltonian ( shifted by a constant so that the _ upper _ equilibrium has energy zero ) @xmath24 with momentum @xmath25 conjugate to @xmath26 , and angular momentum @xmath27 .",
    "this hamiltonian with standard symplectic form @xmath28 has @xmath29 and @xmath30 as constants of motion , such that the constraints @xmath31 and @xmath32 are automatically preserved . using these constraints",
    "hamilton s equations of motion become @xmath33 and are equivalent to .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath34 is another constant of motion .",
    "fixing the constrains defines a system on @xmath35 and this system is liouville integrable because the poisson bracket of the remaining integrals vanishes , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are independent almost everywhere .",
    "formally the hamiltonian also describes the lagrange top written in the space fixed frame and with the body symmetry reduced , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the point @xmath26 is a point on the symmetry axis of the body , and @xmath39 is the value of the equal moments of inertia .",
    "however , for the lagrange top @xmath40 is introduced as an _ independent _ variable ( with the induced poisson structure ) , and for the general motion @xmath41 , which is impossible for the spherical pendulum .",
    "the frequency of small oscillations around the stable lower equilibrium at @xmath42 is @xmath43 .",
    "measuring length in units of @xmath16 , mass in units of @xmath13 , and time in units of @xmath44 all constants can be removed from the hamiltonian . since the transformation to non - dimensionalised variables is not symplectic we prefer to keep the constants for now . in the following we are interested in the dynamics near the unstable upper equilibrium at @xmath45 .",
    "for the normal form calculation near the unstable equilibrium a local symplectic coordinate system on @xmath35 is needed . in the global hamiltonian",
    "we introduce local coordinates @xmath46 in @xmath47 by @xmath48 near @xmath49 .",
    "the conjugate momenta @xmath50 are found from the inverse transpose of the jacobian of the transformation of the coordinates and with @xmath51 the obvious result that @xmath52 and @xmath53 are unchanged and @xmath54 is found . in these symplectic coordinates with",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath55 this hamiltonian could have been derived directly from a lagrangian using @xmath56 and @xmath57 as local coordinates .    before transforming the quadratic part of @xmath37 into williamson normal form @xcite the symplectic scaling @xmath58 , @xmath59 , similarly with @xmath60 ,",
    "thus we have proved    [ localsympcoo ] there exist local symplectic coordinates near the unstable equilibrium of the spherical pendulum with @xmath61 such that @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "taylor expansion of the potential ( the last term in ) gives @xmath66 so that @xmath67 keeps track of the order of the non - linear terms . by scaling all variables",
    "@xmath68 with @xmath69 ( which is a symplectic transformation with multiplier @xmath70 ) all constants could be removed from the hamiltonian up to the overall factor @xmath71 , which could then be removed by a linear scaling of time .",
    "the two _ fundamental constants _ left in the hamiltonian are @xmath72 with unit of time and @xmath70 with unit of angular momentum or action ( i.e.  @xmath73 ) . without changing the symplectic structure and/or the time it is not possible to remove them .",
    "the usual approach to non - dimensionalise all variables ( including time ) is not used here until later because the semi - global symplectic invariants should allow comparison of different systems , and only in one of them these units could be chosen freely .",
    "so far point transformations were used to simplify @xmath37 . to achieve the williamson normal form @xcite of the quadratic part of @xmath37 it turns out that a symplectic rotation in phase space is necessary .",
    "the hessian of the hamiltonian has eigenvalues @xmath74 with algebraic and geometric multiplicity two .",
    "hence the equilibrium is a degenerate saddle - saddle point .",
    "since there are no coupling terms each saddle can be treated separately in its canonical plane .",
    "a rotation by @xmath75 brings the hyperbola @xmath76 into the normal form @xmath77 , similarly for @xmath78 .",
    "thus we have    [ williamson ] the williamson normal form at the unstable equilibrium of the spherical pendulum is achieved by the linear symplectic transformation @xmath79 the hamiltonian in the new coordinates reads @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the quadratic part of the potential has been absorbed in the quadratic normal form terms @xmath84 .",
    "the remaining terms of the potential are of order 4 and higher .",
    "together with the quartic term from the kinetic energy the quartic terms are @xmath85    the angular momentum in the new variables reads @xmath86 , but it does not enter the quadratic williamson normal form . this is why the quadratic normal form gives a degenerate saddle , while from the point of view of the foliation of the integrable system it is a focus - focus point .",
    "the reason for this is that any function of the integrals @xmath37 and @xmath38 is again an integral , and thus has the same foliation .",
    "in particular the linear combination @xmath87 for any @xmath88 has an equilibrium of focus - focus type , with eigenvalues @xmath89 .",
    "incidentally this also shows that this equilibrium is a non - degenerate singularity in the sense of eliasson .",
    "in fact we have achieved more than the williamson normal form , because the second integral is also simultaneously normalised .",
    "see appendix  [ app : linear ] for a few more remarks about this .",
    "from the work of @xcite we know that there is a _ convergent _ birkhoff normal form near a non - degenerate equilibrium of a liouville integrable system .",
    "we are now going to compute this normal form for the spherical pendulum .",
    "the equilibrium is of focus - focus type and thus we know that the hamiltonian can be expressed as a function of two commuting integrals @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where @xmath92 at quadratic order the williamson normal form has already achieved this , @xmath93 .",
    "but the higher order terms still contain other combinations of the variables @xmath94 .",
    "using non - linear near - identity transformations the hamiltonian can be normalized to arbitrary order .",
    "for this we need    [ integral - angle ] the integrals @xmath90 and @xmath91 as given by are momenta of a symplectic coordinate system on @xmath95 with the plane @xmath96 removed .",
    "the canonically conjugate variables are @xmath97    where only @xmath98 is an angle .",
    "the construction mimics the usual action - angle variables near an elliptic - elliptic equilibrium point , however , here we are near a focus - focus point .",
    "formally going into the complex plane we define @xmath99 , @xmath100 so that @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    ". then @xmath103 and taking the real part of the previous formula and using @xmath104 gives the symplecticity of the transformation .",
    "the transformation is defined outside the set @xmath96 .",
    "the inverse of the transformation is given by @xmath105 so that @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "inserting this change of coordinates in to the hamiltonian of lemma  [ williamson ] a new hamiltonian is obtained which is a function of @xmath108 , and @xmath109 only .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that at this stage @xmath90 is only equal to the true eliasson coordinates up to quadratic order .",
    "normalising the hamiltonian order by order each step of the normal form procedure introduces new variables @xmath110 , and then the tildes are dropped . in the limit of infinite order",
    "the hamiltonian thus becomes a function of @xmath90 and @xmath91 only . in our particular case",
    "@xmath91 is unchanged in the process , since @xmath37 is independent of @xmath98 , in other words @xmath91 already is a global integral .",
    "note that the conjugate angle @xmath98 is in general changed by the normalisation process .",
    "we are now going to describe the details of a practical implementation of this iterative procedure .",
    "the hamiltonian is independent of @xmath98 , because this is the angle conjugate to the global integral @xmath111 .",
    "the identity @xmath112 ( using the notation for @xmath113 and @xmath114 of lemma  [ williamson ] ) allows to eliminate occurrences of @xmath115 in @xmath37 using @xmath116 where @xmath117 .",
    "thus we find for the lowest order terms that are non - linear in @xmath118 @xmath119    now we seek a perturbation theory that removes the @xmath120 dependence in this and all higher order terms . the classical approach with mixed variables",
    "generating functions is quite cumbersome at higher order ; it is briefly described in appendix  [ pert ] .",
    "the better alternative is the lie series approach , in which the ( near identity ) canonical transformations are generated by the time @xmath121 map of some flow .",
    "the hamiltonian of this flow is the generating function of the transformation which only depends on the old variables .",
    "the transformation is obtained by integrating this flow , which is conveniently done by computing iterated poisson brackets in a kind of baker - campbell - hausdorff formula .",
    "the abstract formalism is well understood , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a particular version of this type of perturbation theory has to specify a solution to the so called lie - equation ( or homological equation ) @xmath122 where @xmath123 are the terms of order @xmath124 of the given hamiltonian , and @xmath125 are the terms remaining in the transformed hamiltonian , and @xmath126 is the generator of the transformation , all at stage @xmath124 of the iterated transformation process . the range @xmath127 of the homological operator @xmath128 is the set of terms that can be removed within the chosen class of transformations generated by @xmath126 .",
    "a particular normal form consists of choosing a complement to the range @xmath129 , which is the set of unremovable terms at stage @xmath124 .",
    "hence @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "if the homological operator @xmath132 is semisimple @xmath129 is the kernel of the homological operator . in the classical example of birkhoff normal form near",
    "an elliptic equilibrium point @xmath125 is the average of @xmath123 over the flow of @xmath133 , while @xmath134 is the oscillating part .",
    "the solvability condition for @xmath126 is that @xmath135 has zero average .",
    "we assume that the hamiltonian is in williamson normal form of lemma  [ williamson ] and written in terms of the `` integral - angle '' coordinates of lemma  [ integral - angle ] , hence @xmath93 for the spherical pendulum .",
    "a higher order term @xmath123 is in normal form when it is a function of @xmath136 alone .",
    "this is similar to the usual birkhoff normal form near an elliptic equilibrium .",
    "the essential difference is that here @xmath90 is not a canonical action ( it does not have a periodic flow , in other words , @xmath120 is not an angle ) . define a family of classes of functions @xmath137 as functions of the form @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a degree @xmath140 homogeneous polynomial .",
    "the operator @xmath141 simply gives @xmath142 .",
    "this operator is simple and splits into kernel and range .",
    "the kernel consists of functions @xmath129 that are independent of @xmath120 .",
    "because of the particular form of the class of functions @xmath143 only the identity is in the kernel for odd @xmath124 , while for even @xmath124 the kernel consists of polynomials @xmath144 .",
    "the range consists of functions @xmath127 where each term does depend on @xmath120 , in other words @xmath143 with @xmath129 removed .    using this in conjunction with theorem vii.b.4 in @xcite",
    "we can now prove    [ nofo ] the lie series normal form with respect to @xmath145 for the spherical pendulum is unique and the normalised hamiltonian is a function of @xmath90 and @xmath109 only .",
    "we have already observed that this operator acting on @xmath143 is simple . for uniqueness",
    "we need to check @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the latter is true since @xmath90 and @xmath91 commute .",
    "the former holds because the commutator yields a function in @xmath148 .",
    "the transformation given in lemma  [ integral - angle ] combined with lemma  [ williamson ] shows that all higher order terms @xmath123 are in @xmath137 .",
    "finally we need to solve the lie equation , and show that it has a solution in @xmath127 . in our case",
    "the lie equation reads @xmath149 since the left hand side is in @xmath127 ( indefinite ) integration with respect to @xmath120 gives @xmath150 .",
    "the normalised hamiltonian is a function of @xmath109 only because the original hamiltonian has the discrete symmetry @xmath151 as well .",
    "thus in fact the polynomials @xmath139 are also even functions of @xmath91 , and this property is preserved in the normalisation process .    note that there are no small denominators in this process , since there is just one angle involved .",
    "moser showed in @xcite that even in the general non - integrable case a loxodromic equilibrium point has a convergent normal form .",
    "the above theorem shows how the eliasson normal form of the spherical pendulum can be computed using lie series . in the resulting normalised hamiltonian",
    "all the higher order terms are in @xmath129 , i.e.  they depend on @xmath136 only , as desired .",
    "thus we obtain    [ bnf1 ] the normal form at the focus - focus point of the spherical pendulum is @xmath152    the proof is obtained by straightforward but lengthy calculation along the lines given in lemma  [ nofo ] , and the details are omitted .",
    "here we just give the first steps of this computation to illustrate the process .",
    "there are no third order terms , so @xmath153 .",
    "next the @xmath120 independent terms in @xmath154 can be read off from : @xmath155 and integration of the remaining terms gives the generating function whose flow removes these terms : @xmath156 the terms of third order in @xmath157 are the unremovable terms in @xmath158 .",
