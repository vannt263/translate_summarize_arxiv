    "over the past decade , statistical hadronization model ( shm ) approaches , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite , were quite successful in describing the particle multiplicities measured in heavy - ion collisions at various beam energies @xmath0 , allowing to deduce the chemical freeze - out parameters as unique functions of the beam energy .",
    "as a complementary method for determining the conditions at freeze - out , fluctuations in the conserved charges of qcd , i.e.  baryon number @xmath1 , electric charge @xmath2 and strangeness @xmath3 , were proposed  @xcite .",
    "the latter can be calculated from first - principles in lattice qcd  @xcite and compared with corresponding measurements of the moments of multiplicity distributions .",
    "experimental data on fluctuations in the net - electric charge and the net - proton number ( not a conserved charge but often assumed to be a good proxy for net - baryon number ) became recently available from the beam energy scan program at rhic  @xcite .",
    "thermal models provide another possibility to extract the freeze - out parameters from fluctuation observables . in the approach discussed here",
    ", we consider a grandcanonical ensemble of hadrons and resonances as listed in  @xcite .",
    "this implies that charge conservation is respected in the means but not in the higher - order moments .",
    "given that this as well as other non - included fluctuation sources , e.g.  critical fluctuations , have a negligible influence on the observables we study , we show that an extraction of the chemical freeze - out parameters is feasible within our approach .",
    "in this work , we concentrate on the lowest moments of the measured multiplicity distributions and determine the conditions at chemical freeze - out such that the experimental data  @xcite for mean @xmath4 and variance @xmath5 are reproduced within error bars . for the net - electric charge one has @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the average of the number @xmath8 of particles of type @xmath9 with electric charge @xmath10 , and @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "the sums run over all charged hadrons contained in the measurement . as electric charge",
    "is dominated by @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we restrict our model to this ensemble . for the net - proton number one",
    "has @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where the covariance between protons and anti - protons @xmath21 vanishes in our approach . to take the actual experimental situation more accurately into account",
    ", several physically relevant aspects are included in our study as explained in the following .      the experimental coverage in rapidity ( or pseudo - rapidity ) and transverse momentum is limited by the detector design and the demands from particle reconstruction and identification .",
    "to account for this acceptance limitation , it was proposed in  @xcite to restrict the phase - space integrals in a thermal model correspondingly . in  @xcite , the sensitivity of moment ratios to kinematic cuts was found to be small for net - protons and more pronounced for the net - electric charge .",
    "we follow this proposal and apply kinematic cuts in line with the experimental analysis  @xcite .",
    "resonance decays can , event by event , significantly influence the final multiplicities of stable ( with respect to strong and electromagnetic decays ) particles . a contamination from secondaries , e.g.  weak decay contributions from @xmath22 to @xmath17 or spallation protons from the beam pipe ,",
    "was reported to be suppressed through the experimental analysis  @xcite . in our model ,",
    "contributions from resonance decays to the averages @xmath7 and @xmath23 in @xmath4 and @xmath5 are included via @xmath24 in eqs .",
    "( [ equ:1 ] ) and  ( [ equ:2 ] ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the primordial ( before resonance decay ) numbers of stable particles @xmath9 and resonances @xmath27 , while @xmath28 and @xmath29 are decay - channel averages , with @xmath30-th channel branching ratio @xmath31 and @xmath32 the number of @xmath9 produced in that decay - channel of @xmath27 . as the decay of a resonance is a probabilistic process ,",
    "causing itself event - by - event fluctuations in the final hadron multiplicities , the averages in @xmath4 and @xmath5 involve an averaging over the thermal ensemble and over resonance decays . the thermal , primordial means and ( co)variances are obtained in our model by derivatives of the pressure @xmath33 with respect to the particle chemical potentials @xmath34 as ( indices @xmath9 and @xmath35 stand for hadrons or resonances here ) @xmath36",
    "although in the grandcanonical ensemble the primordial covariances @xmath37 between different particle species vanish , resonance decays can induce correlations such that the covariances between different hadrons affect the moments of the net - electric charge distribution .",
    "due to baryon - number conservation this is , however , not the case for net protons . interestingly",
    ", the form of the factors @xmath38 implies that the fluctuation contributions associated with the probabilistic nature of resonance decays can be small or zero depending on the charge under consideration : if the number of produced charges is the same in each decay channel of @xmath27 , they will exactly vanish . in the case of the net - electric charge",
    "this means that although individual factors such as @xmath39 can be non - zero , the probabilistic contributions cancel each other exactly in the double - sum over all charged hadrons in @xmath40 because electric charge is conserved in each decay .",
    "since we restrict the ensemble of considered hadrons , however , we expect some but sub - dominant contributions from resonances decaying , in addition , into charged hyperons . in the case of the net - proton number ,",
    "probabilistic fluctuation contributions are significant and vanish only for the @xmath41-resonances .",
    "a systematic study for net protons was presented in  @xcite .",
    "final state effects may significantly influence fluctuations , in particular , in the net - proton number . the regeneration and subsequent decay of @xmath42-resonances via @xmath43 can change the isospin identity of the nucleons @xmath17 and @xmath44 ( similar for anti - nucleons ) and , thus , influence their multiplicity distributions . as the electric charge is conserved in these reactions",
    ", they do not affect the fluctuations in the net - electric charge .",
    "also , the mean @xmath45 is not altered , but the higher - order moments of the net - proton distribution are influenced . for high enough pion densities and a long enough hadronic phase ( before free streaming ) , such that a full isospin randomization can be assumed , correction expressions for the moments of the net - proton distribution based on the moments of baryon and anti - baryon distributions can be derived , cf .",
    "it was argued in  @xcite that the necessary conditions are satisfied for @xmath46  gev .    excluding explicitly weak decay contributions from hyperons , these correction expressions may be formulated in terms of the moments of the nucleon and anti - nucleon distributions .",
    "accordingly , the effect of isospin randomization is included in our model as @xmath47 with @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the entering quantities are calculated via eqs .",
    "( [ equ:1 ] ) -  ( [ equ:3 ] ) .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the main effect of these corrections is to make the net - proton distribution look poissonian independent of whether the probabilistic fluctuation contributions from resonance decays are taken into account or not .",
    "with the abovementioned refinements in our thermal model , one can determine the values for temperature @xmath52 and baryo - chemical potential @xmath53 at chemical freeze - out by comparing the measured moment ratios @xmath54 and @xmath55 with the model results , fulfilling additionally physical constraints on @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in the moment ratios , the volume @xmath58 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ equ:3 ] ) cancels when ignoring fluctuations in @xmath58 itself .",
    "the corresponding parameter values for @xmath52 and @xmath53 were reported in  @xcite and contrasted with different results from lattice qcd and with shm results in  @xcite .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we show the quality of the description of the double - ratio @xmath59 of the measured moment ratios with our model obtained for the freeze - out parameters  @xcite . since we assume full isospin randomization independent of the beam energy , we restrict our study to @xmath60  gev .",
