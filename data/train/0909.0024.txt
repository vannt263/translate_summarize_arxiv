    "cosmological data from a wide range of sources including type ia supernovae @xcite , the cosmic microwave background @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite , cluster gas fractions @xcite and gamma ray bursts @xcite seem to indicate that at least @xmath7 of the energy density in the universe is in the form of an exotic , negative - pressure component , called dark energy .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "it is usually assumed that a scalar field with a postulated potential may yield the equation of state needed to drive the acceleration .",
    "while it is easy to come up with such a potential ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the underlying problem is that we have not discovered a single fundamental scalar field so far .",
    "fundamental scalar fields , being unprotected from radiative corrections , are very problematic since they require a significant fine tuning in theory ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    ". couplings of the quintessence field with other standard model particles , in particular fermions , must be suppressed @xcite ( however , see @xcite for a discussion of pngb quintessence models which are radiatively stable and see @xcite for a quintessence model which can couple strongly enough with standard model particles to be detected in colliders ) .",
    "it is therefore instructive to search for other degrees of freedom which may effectively play a role similar to the scalar field .",
    "recently , the existence of a new scale invariant sector very weakly coupled to the standard model was postulated @xcite .",
    "the fundamental energy scale , @xmath6 , of this sector is perhaps far beyond the reach of today s or near - future accelerators .",
    "however , the existence of such a sector may affect low energy phenomenology . the effective low energy field theory which describes these effects",
    "is often called unparticle physics since these new degrees of freedom would not behave as ordinary particles .",
    "for example , their scaling dimension does not have to be an integer or half an integer .",
    "because of the scale invariance , the fundamental particles are massless .",
    "an unparticle is a composite state of the fundamental massless particles , and couples to the standard model particles through a heavy mediator .",
    "this heavy mediator has a mass of the order of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , interactions between the unparticles and the standard model particles is suppressed by powers of @xmath6 .",
    "another important characteristic of unparticles is that their mass can take continuous values @xcite .",
    "for example , the mass of an unparticle with energy @xmath8 can take all the values from zero to @xmath8 .",
    "a lot of work @xcite recently focused on the new collider signals for unparticle physics .",
    "the unparticles could also play the role in gravity and cosmology @xcite .",
    "black hole hawking radiation of unparticles was studied in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will try to answer the question whether scalar unparticle degrees of freedom can play the role of dark energy .",
    "an unparticle dark energy model is interesting for a number of reasons . in the simple model of unparticles constructed in @xcite ,",
    "the fundamental degrees of freedom at high energies are fermions .",
    "unparticles are bound states of these fermions , but at energies below a certain  phase transition scale \" @xmath0 they appear as the fundamental degrees of freedom .",
    "this situation is analogous to quarks and mesons in qcd .",
    "while fundamental scalar fields are not protected from radiative corrections , unparticles are , since ( like in technicolor models ) the fundamental fields are fermions whose mass is protected .",
    "also , coupling of unparticles to the standard model fields can be arbitrarily suppressed by raising the fundamental energy scale @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the unparticle dark energy model is free of most of the problems that plague fundamental scalar field quintessence models .    in exploring this idea",
    "further , we will study in detail an unparticle dark energy model with @xmath9 quintessence potential . since the effective scalar unparticle degree of freedom @xmath10 is quite different from the fundamental scalar ( i.e. different scaling dimension , continuous mass etc . )",
    "the phenomenology may be quite different from the standard one .",
    "we will derive the effective functional dependence of the energy density of the universe on @xmath10 and @xmath11 in order to calculate the hubble expansion rate as the function of the same parameters .",
    "we will then confront the type ia supernova ( snia ) , baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data with the predictions of the model .",
    "consider a scalar unparticle degree of freedom @xmath10 , with the standard kinetic term and simple potential @xmath12 . the energy density and pressure can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mass of this field . since unparticles",
    "do not have a fixed mass , we take the mass @xmath14 to be the average of the mass distribution @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass spectral density of unparticles , while @xmath0 is the scale of the phase transition above which unparticle description stops being valid and therefore is the maximum mass of unparticles .",
    "it is important to distinguish @xmath0 from @xmath6 .",
    "while @xmath6 is the new fundamental scale with ordinary particle degree of freedom , @xmath0 is the scale at which these fundamental degrees of freedom are seen as unparticles .",
    "the normalization factor is introduced to preserve the unparticle number .",
    "we believe that taking the average of the ( continuous ) unparticle mass distribution is the most convenient way to capture an average collective influence of unparticles on the evolution of the energy density of the universe .",
    "of course , this is not a unique way to do this , one may for example consider two fields , one at the top and one at the bottom of the mass distribution",
    ". it will be interesting to consider alternative approaches , however , we take here the minimalistic average behavior approach .",
    "the mass spectral density of unparticles with continuous mass @xcite can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath3 is the scaling dimension of unparticles .",
    "the scale @xmath18 is included for dimensional reasons and in the simplest case is equal to the  phase transition scale \" @xmath0 . strictly speaking",
    "the exact normalization of unparticles is unknown since we do not know how many unparticle degrees of freedom there are , neither we know the precise combinatorics factors ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "however , since we are taking an average of the mass distribution of unparticles in eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) , precise normalization of unparticles does not matter . substituting ( [ massd ] ) in ( [ m ] ) we get @xmath19    we consider now an unparticle scalar field with negligible kinetic energy , which is an analog of a slowly rolling scalar field . from eq .",
    "( [ rp ] ) , the energy density is @xmath20    now , we make the assumption that , as long as the kinetic energy is negligible , @xmath21 .",
    "this is just a statement that the value of the field is of the same order of magnitude as the maximum unparticle mass for the relevant energy scale . in this case",
    "we can write equation ( [ density - lambda ] ) as @xmath22 we can now express the mass term as @xmath23    the constant @xmath2 is , in general , a function of the unparticle scaling dimension @xmath3 . if we set the constant of proportionality between @xmath0 and @xmath10 to unity , we obtain [ bdu ] b= while this may not be an exact expression for @xmath2 , it should be correct up to an @xmath24 factor .",
    "the energy density and pressure can now be replaced by @xmath25    in what follows , we will use this unparticle setup in the cosmological context .",
    "we will assume that the scalar unparticle degree of freedom plays the role of a quintessence field .",
    "we note here that in @xcite a different equation of state was derived for unparticle degrees of freedom .",
    "however , there , a model of bosons in thermal equilibrium was used , which is appropriate for the dark matter description , but not for our purpose of a slowly rolling scalar field .",
    "we first rewrite the relation eq .",
    "( [ rhoold ] ) for our purpose as ( dots denote time derivatives ) : [ rho_useless ] _ u=^2+b^2+_where we have shifted the potential by the cosmological constant @xmath26 for convenience . from here , one can express @xmath27 as [ rho ] _",

    "the initial value of the matter and radiation densities can be obtained by appropriately redshifting the observed present - day matter and radiation densities to @xmath40 .",
    "the initial velocity of the field is set to zero , since the field can be assumed to be frozen on account of the very high hubble friction - we have checked that even if the field is given an initial velocity it quickly comes to rest .",
    "the evolution is continued until the matter density parameter reaches the observed value of @xmath45 .",
    "clearly , the three parameters that completely determine the evolution of the system are the following :    * the observed present matter density parameter @xmath46 .",
    "* the constant @xmath2 , which is a function of the scaling dimension of unparticles , as explained above ( see eq .",

    "that @xmath47 , if the kinetic term is negligible , and that the field is slowly rolling , the parameter @xmath4 is essentially the same as initial @xmath0 .",
    "we now consider the evolution of the equation of state of the unparticle dark energy .",
    "the effect of varying @xmath2 on the function @xmath48 is shown in fig .",
    "( [ onepw_vs_a_phi1 ] ) , where the initial value of the field is fixed at @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath1 always starts out at @xmath50 , as a result of our choosing the initial velocity of the field to be zero . for small values of @xmath2 , @xmath1 increases slowly .",
    "however , as @xmath2 increases , @xmath1 evolves faster .",

    "if one makes the same plots for smaller ( or larger ) fixed values of @xmath2 , the shapes of the plots remain the same , though the amplitude of fluctuation of @xmath1 is smaller ( or larger ) .",

    "<S> we examine a dark energy model where a scalar unparticle degree of freedom plays the role of quintessence . in particular , we study a model where the unparticle degree of freedom has a standard kinetic term and a simple mass potential , the evolution is slowly rolling and the field value is of the order of the unparticle energy scale ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we study how the evolution of @xmath1 depends on the parameters @xmath2 ( a function of the unparticle scaling dimension @xmath3 ) , the initial value of the field @xmath4 ( or equivalently , @xmath0 ) and the present matter density @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we use observational data from type ia supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillations and the cosmic microwave background to constrain the model parameters and find that these models are not ruled out by the observational data . from a theoretical point of view , </S>",
    "<S> an unparticle dark energy model is very attractive , since unparticles ( being bound states of fundamental fermions ) are protected from radiative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> further , coupling of unparticles to the standard model fields can be arbitrarily suppressed by raising the fundamental energy scale @xmath6 , making the unparticle dark energy model free of most of the problems that plague conventional scalar field quintessence models . </S>"
