    "for the practical application of the mode shaping it is crucial to excite ions to the rydberg state with high fidelity which can be a challenge if the trapping potentials of ell and rydberg states are very different : in general the ( reduced ) density matrix of the ion to be excited is given by @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the density matrix of the external degrees of freedom .",
    "the rydberg excitation needs to take the ion to the state @xmath109 as the shaped modes are only present if the electronic population of the ion is entirely transferred to @xmath110 .",
    "note , that the density matrix of the external degrees of freedom can in general change during the excitation process , e.g. , due to non - trivial franck - condon factors which arise from the different potential shapes in low - lying and rydberg states  @xcite .",
    "there are a number of strategies to perform the transfer with high fidelity : for example , one can cool all phonon modes to the ground state , such that the initial state @xmath108 is precisely known . the excitation laser pulse ( frequency , strength and duration )",
    "can then be optimized to achieve perfect electronic state transfer .",
    "alternatively , one can use a broad band laser excitation that does not resolve the individual phonon modes @xcite and thus performs the transfer independently of the phonon state .",
    "both methods , however , are rather challenging with current technology  @xcite .",
    "a currently feasible alternative is to remove the difference in the trapping potentials during the excitation process by altering the polarizability of rydberg states through the application of a microwave field ( mw ) which creates dressed states of tuneable polaizability .",
    "the rydberg excitation is then no longer different than the excitation of ell states .",
    "after the excitation has been carried out the mw is switched off in a way that is adiabatic on electronic timescales but can be highly non adiabatic on the timescale of the phonon dynamics .",
    "the scheme works as follows : together with rydberg laser , we apply a mw field that couples the rydberg @xmath111 ( denoted by @xmath112 ) with a nearby s - state @xmath113 ( denoted by @xmath114 ) .",
    "the corresponding ion - field interaction is given by @xmath115 where @xmath116 @xmath117 is the laser ( mw ) electric field and @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) is the rydberg laser ( mw ) frequency .",
    "both the rydberg laser and the mw field are linearly polarized along the @xmath24-axis .",
    "the field - free rydberg energies are @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively . to be concrete we also assume @xmath122 . to proceed it is convenient to transform into the interaction picture .",
    "using the unitary operator @xmath123 and in rotating - wave approximation , we obtain the hamiltonian ( @xmath124 ) @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 . @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "we consider a strong mw field , @xmath130 , for which it is convenient to use the dressed state in order to describe dynamics of the rydberg states . by diagonalizing the part of hamiltonian ( [ eq : ion_field ] ) that contains the mw coupling part ,",
    "the dressed states are given by @xmath131 with @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the normalization constant .",
    "the dressed state energy is @xmath134 . with the dressed state at hand , the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : ion_field ] ) becomes @xmath135 with @xmath136 .",
    "thus the low - lying @xmath9 state is now coupled with the two dressed state . here",
    "the large energy splitting allows us to address the dressed states individually with the rydberg laser .",
    "the polarizability of the dressed state is @xmath137 ) . as @xmath138 for high - lying rydberg state ,",
    "the polarizability of the dressed state vanishes under certain conditions .",
    "for example , for @xmath139 , @xmath140 when @xmath141 , which can be realized by controlling the mw frequency and/or rabi frequency .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath140 , the trapping potential of the rydberg ion in the dressed state becomes identical with that of the ions in ell states .",
    "in this case the franck - condon factors @xcite become trivial and the laser excitation is no different to transitions driven among ell states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : suppfig2]a we demonstrate the @xmath142 state excitation . after a @xmath143-pulse , the ion is excited to the @xmath142 state .",
    "once the state @xmath142 is excited , the rydberg laser is switched off and also the mw is switched off such that @xmath142 is adiabatically transferred to the state @xmath112 . as an example , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : suppfig2]b a case in which the mw detuning is changed according to @xmath144 $ ] .",
    "the rydberg ion is fully populating the @xmath8 state after about 13 nanoseconds .",

    "<S> the second term gives rise to a phonon - induced spin - spin coupling between the @xmath3-th and @xmath12-th qubit thereby effectuating a cpf gate . </S>",
    "<S> a perfect cpf gate is realized when @xmath74 and @xmath75 . as shown in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this can be achieved via optimizing the time - dependent profile of the rabi frequencies @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> such optimization is challenging since in general many phonon modes contribute even when only a single cpf gate operation is conducted within a long ion chain . </S>",
    "<S> rydberg mode shaping has the potential to drastically reduce the complexity of such optimization procedure as even in long crystals only few vibrational modes actually couple to the qubit ions located on a sub - crystal .    </S>",

    "<S> the gate lasers are switched on for a time @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the oscillation period of the bus mode and the rabi frequency is assumed to follow @xmath78 ( as also discussed in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> we assume the following sequence : the ions are initially in ell states and the phonon density matrix @xmath89 is a thermal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> rydberg ions are subsequently excited via protocol that is highly non - adiabatic w.r.t . </S>",
    "<S> the phonons , i.e. the phonon density matrix is unchanged . in the supplementary material - part </S>",
    "<S> a we provide more detail on such protocol . the gate fidelity is then calculated via a transformation that expresses @xmath89 in terms of the shaped vibrational modes  @xcite ( see supplementary material - part b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider a situation in which the two cpf gates start simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the highest achievable fidelity within our simple ansatz is @xmath90 . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3]a , this maximum occurs at @xmath91 ( with @xmath92 an integer ) . at these points </S>",
    "<S> the bus modes almost entirely return to their initial states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that such a high fidelity is achievable within this simple ansatz is a direct consequence of the fact that the rydberg ions delimiting the sub - crystal lead to a dramatic reduction of the number of vibrational modes that couple to the qubit ions . without this rydberg mode shaping the highest fidelity that we can achieve </S>",

    "<S> the solid ( dashed ) curve stands for the calculation with ( without ) mode shaping.,width=329 ]    finally , let us discuss additional sources that would influence the gate fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the fidelity will be in principle reduced by the radiative decay of the rydberg state . </S>",
    "<S> this is mitigated by the fact that cpf gates are inherently fast  @xcite and that rydberg states are long lived . </S>",
    "<S> for example , choosing the @xmath99 state , we obtain a rydberg lifetime @xmath100s and with the trap parameters @xmath101 , @xmath102 mhz and @xmath103 we obtain a gate time @xmath104s . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the rydberg excitation time , the gate fidelity will be modified by an overall factor , about @xmath105 with @xmath106 the number of rydberg ions that are excited during the gate operation . however , in principle the gate operations can be accelerated by using a more sophisticated optimization protocol  @xcite , and furthermore optimized gate schemes can be imagined in which the rydberg ions do not stay permanently excited . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , infidelities are caused by other factors , such as the anharmonicity of the ionic motion and corrections beyond the lamb - dicke limit . </S>",
    "<S> these have been investigated in detail by lin _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and their contributions have been found to be marginal .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that the transverse vibrational modes of a linear ion chain can be shaped by the selective excitation of rydberg ions leading to the emergence of strongly localized modes . </S>",
    "<S> rydberg mode shaping , when applied to larger ( higher dimensional ) ion crystals , might indicate a route towards scalable quantum computation within a single large ion crystal . </S>",
    "<S> one can think of dedicated ions which are not used as qubits but only for segmenting the large crystal . when excited they give rise to local modes that permit the parallel manipulation of sets of qubits . </S>",
    "<S> when deexcited the non - local character of the vibrational modes is restored permitting the entanglement of more distant qubits .    </S>",
