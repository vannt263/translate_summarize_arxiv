    "although transport in low - dimensional quantum systems has intensively been investigated theoretically in the past years , there still is an ongoing interest in understanding the transport phenomena in such systems , including their temperature and length scale dependence @xcite .",
    "those works have often addressed a qualitative classification of the occurring transport types into ballistic or normal diffusive behavior and , in particular cases , the crucial mechanisms which are responsible for the emergence of diffusion have been studied . in this context",
    "the role of non - integrability and quantum chaos is frequently discussed as an at least necessary condition @xcite .",
    "significant theoretical attention has been devoted to spin-@xmath0 chains @xcite , e.g.  to the prominent anisotropic heisenberg chain ( xxz model ) @xcite .",
    "most controversial appears the question whether or not the ( finite temperature ) transport in the pure heisenberg chain is ballistic @xcite .",
    "even though there certainly is a large variety of different methods for the investigation of transport in quantum systems , we concentrate here on two of the main approaches in detail which are also most relevant in the context of the present work .",
    "the first approach may be classified as a direct one , since it is rather close to an experimental measurement setup : within the theory of open quantum systems @xcite the model of interest is coupled locally , e.g.  at both ends of a spin chain , to reservoirs of the transported quantity , e.g.  at different temperature or chemical potential @xcite . due to the coupling to reservoirs , a stationary non - equilibrium state eventually results for which all relevant expectation values such as the current and the spatial density profile of the transport quantity can be evaluated . here",
    ", a vanishing profile corresponds to ballistic behavior , whereas normal diffusive dynamics is associated with a strictly linear profile , according to fourier s law , respectively fick s law , see , e.g.  ref .  . in the latter case a finite conductivity is simply given by the ratio of the current and the spatial density gradient of the transported quantity .",
    "this conductivity can be also understood in terms of a diffusion coefficient , since transport is driven by a gradient within the considered model and not by an external force @xcite .",
    "one may therefore directly compare with the diffusion constant of a corresponding closed scenario , where transport is not induced by the coupling to baths but by an initially inhomogeneous non - equilibrium density @xcite .    in order to simulate the influence of the baths the liouville - von neumann equation for the coherent evolution of the density matrix",
    "is routinely extended by an incoherent damping term , see , e.g.  ref .  .",
    "the derivation of such a dynamical equation from a microscopic bath model is highly non - trivial and involves a combination of various subtle approximation schemes , e.g.  improper approximations may eventually lead to a mathematically correct but physically irrelevant quantum master equation ( * qme*)@xcite .",
    "one often intends to derive a proper * qme * of the lindblad form @xcite , because its special structure allows to apply the numerically efficient method of stochastic unraveling @xcite , e.g.  spin-@xmath0 chains with about @xmath1 sites become numerically tractable @xcite .",
    "however , a recently suggested matrix product operator ansatz has been shown to significantly increase this number of available sites up to several dozens @xcite , i.e.  finite size effects are drastically reduced and the extracted conductivity may be interpreted as a pure bulk property of the model , if it does not depend crucially on the concrete form and strength of the bath coupling , of course @xcite .",
    "another approach for the investigation of transport in quantum systems is the green - kubo formula ( * kf * ) which was originally derived for electrical conductance by the use of linear response theory @xcite . in that case",
    "the ( frequency - dependent ) electrical field is an external force which perturbs the system and the resulting current of charge through the system is the response to this external perturbation .",
    "the * kf * as such gives the ( frequency - dependent ) conductivity as the linear response coefficient in terms of a current auto - correlation function .",
    "the same approach is also used in the context of gradient - driven transport phenomena , e.g.  for transport of energy or heat . in that case the current is driven by a much more complicated mechanism @xcite , especially since it can not be treated as a perturbation to the system .",
    "nevertheless , simply by the replacement of the electrical current , e.g.  by the energy current @xcite , the * kf * is used for gradient - driven transport , too . but",
    "a rigorous justification of this replacement remains still a conceptual problem , see ref .   or the overview paper ( and the comprehensive literature which is cited therein ) .",
    "however , the * kf * is nowadays a standard method for the investigation of transport in spin chains @xcite , not least due to its direct computability , once a finite piece of the considered system has been exactly diagonalized .",
    "as far as numerics is concerned , exact diagonalization is restricted to spin-1/2 chains with at most 24 sites . but another difficulty arises , if the * kf * is evaluated on the basis of a finite piece : one often distinguishes between ballistic and normal diffusive transport by the notion of the drude weight , essentially the conductivity s singular contribution at zero - frequency , see the review , for example . whenever it is finite , the long - time behavior is expected to be ballistic , and whenever it vanishes , the dc - conductivity as the zero - frequency limit of the conductivity s regular non - singular part determines the long - time behavior .",
    "since for any finite system the conductivity exclusively consists of delta peaks at different frequencies , there apparently are only singular contributions and it therefore is a difficult question how to extract and extrapolate the dc - conductivity from a finite system @xcite .",
    "moreover , the quantitative comparison of the resulting dc - conductivity ( due to a possibly hypothetic external force ) with a diffusion constant ( from non - equilibrium bath scenarios ) is hardly possible without the detailed knowledge about an einstein relation between both quantities .    in the present paper",
    "we do not intend to further discuss the above mentioned conceptual and methodological problems which may come along with the * kf*. instead we will present a different but in a sense related approach which particularly is not concerned with the most of those problems . to this end",
    "we will firstly introduce a `` typical '' inhomogeneous non - equilibrium density in sec .  [ diffusion ] and then connect the evolution of the variance of this density to a current auto - correlation function at finite times @xcite .",
    "remarkably , in the special limit of infinitely long times this connection will be shown to yield a generalized einstein relation which relates the diffusion constant to the dc - conductivity , i.e.  as evaluated by the * kf*. moreover , we will demonstrate that the great advantage of the connection is given by its direct applicability at finite times and for finite systems as well . in this context",
    "we will suggest another concept for the analysis of data which is available from current auto - correlations functions .    by the use of the suggested concept we will investigate in secs .  [ tilted]-[alternating ] transport in several translationally invariant spin-1/2 chains in the special limit of high temperatures .",
    "we will concretely consider spin transport in the anisotropic heisenberg chain , the pure heisenberg chain within an alternating field , and energy transport in an ising chain which is exposed to a tilted field . by means of",
    "numerically exact diagonalization we indeed observe strong indications for diffusive behavior in the considered spin chains for a range of model parameters and , what is more , we are able to quantitatively confirm the diffusion constants which were found for these systems from non - equilibrium bath scenarios in refs .  .",
    "finally , we will close in sec .",

    "we may therefore suggest purely ballistic behavior for the case @xmath111 .    note that sirker et al .",

    "such a modification certainly is the incorporation of disorder , i.e.  coupling constants or field strengths which vary randomly from one site to another @xcite .",
    "but the investigation of disorder is numerically rather challenging and conceptually more subtle due to the localization phenomenon , even for a non - interacting single - particle system @xcite .",
    "instead we will consider another scenario without disorder , where the heisenberg chain is exposed to a strictly alternating field .",
    "this scenario is concretely described by the hamiltonian ( [ h_anisotropic ] ) and an additional zeeman term of the form @xcite @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the deviation from the mean @xmath125 . as already done before , we may set @xmath127 for simplicity",
    ".    the presence of the zeeman term ( [ h_alternating ] ) does not affect the commutation of @xmath4 and @xmath128 , i.e.  the hamiltonian can be diagonalized within decoupled @xmath130-subspaces , too .",

    "however , for @xmath178 the @xmath2-curve has already converged until the end of this oscillation , see fig .  [ d_alternating ] ( top inset ) .",
    "exactly at this position the curve seems to gradually develop a plateau with a height on the order of @xmath179 .",
    "the plateau becomes visible , since the drude weight rapidly decreases with @xmath7 , i.e.  it is about one order of magnitude smaller for @xmath178 than for @xmath63 , cf .  fig",

    "note that the drude weight does not fulfill a simple @xmath180-dependence and decays faster than a power - law .",

    "remarkably , the above suggested @xmath101 for @xmath181 agrees well with the conductivity @xmath182 from ref .",
    ", as found therein from a non - equilibrium bath scenario .",
    "the deviation from this conductivity is on the order of @xmath183 solely .",
    "however , the small deviation may be explained as follows : in ref .",
    "the conductivity is evaluated by the use of the lindblad equation , i.e. , it is extracted from the steady state of a finite chain which is at both ends weakly coupled to baths at different temperatures .",
    "this weak bath - coupling is essential for the validity of the lindblad approach .",
    "but , for a finite chain , a too weak bath - coupling may also yield a value @xmath67 which is lower than the correct value , say , @xmath101 , see ref .  .",
    "since in ref",
    ".   the independence of the conductivity from the bath - coupling strength is not analyzed in detail , we suppose that the above deviation results from a slightly too weak coupling of chain and reservoirs .    for larger field parameters @xmath176 suggestions are less reliable , since the initial oscillations of the @xmath2-curves become much more pronounced , as already visible in fig .",
    "[ d_alternating ] ( bottom ) .",
    "even though there are oscillations , @xmath2 still remains strictly positive , i.e.  those oscillations probably are no pointer towards insulating behavior .",

    "[ d_anisotropic ] ( top ) into fig .",
    "[ d_alternating ] ( top ) , i.e.  one basically is concerned with the problem that the drude weight governs the overall shape of the curve , at least for accessible system sizes .",
    "in the present paper we have investigated transport in several translationally invariant spin-@xmath0 chains in the special limit of high temperatures . we have concretely considered spin transport in the anisotropic heisenberg chain , in the pure heisenberg chain within an alternating field , and energy transport in an ising chain which is exposed to a tilted field .    to this end",
    "we have firstly reviewed on a recently derived connection between the evolution of the variance of some `` typical '' inhomogeneous non - equilibrium density and the current auto - correlation function at finite times @xcite . in the limit of infinitely long times this connection was shown to yield a generalized einstein relation which relates the diffusion constant ( in the absence of any external force ) to the dc - conductivity ( as the linear response coefficient in the presence of an external force , i.e.  as evaluated from the standard green - kubo formula @xcite ) .",
    "however , we have additionally demonstrated that the great advantage of the above connection is given by its direct applicability at finite times and for finite systems , e.g.  at short times interesting signatures of an infinitely large system may be extractable for a system with an accessible size .    by means of",
    "numerically exact diagonalization we have indeed observed strong indications for diffusive behavior in the considered spin chains for a range of model parameters .",
    "moreover , the suggested diffusion constants have been found to be in quantitative agreement with recent results on diffusion coefficients which were obtained for the same spin chains from numerically involved investigations of non - equilibrium bath scenarios in refs .  .",
    "amongst all those and our findings at high temperatures the emergence of diffusive transport of magnetization appears to be verified in the anisotropic heisenberg chain with the anisotropy parameter @xmath121 @xcite , despite the integrability of the model .",
    "it is known that the onset of quantum chaos is not a sufficient condition for diffusion @xcite but the latter result suggests also that non - integrability is not necessary at all .",
    "unfortunately , it is still an open question whether spin transport in the pure heisenberg chain is diffusive or ballistic . simply by the use of numerically exact diagonalization",
    "we were not able to reach those system sizes which are required for any definite conclusion on that question .",
    "therefore the next step certainly is the application of approximate methods in order to obtain the current auto - correlation function at finite times , either numerical ones , e.g.  suzuki - trotter decompositions @xcite , or analytical ones , e.g.  projection operator techniques @xcite or moment methods @xcite .",
    "approximative methods will also be in indispensable , when the investigation is extended from one - dimensional spin chains to , e.g.  more - dimensional spin lattices .",
    "apart from the above methodic details , a physically interesting question is the dependence of transport on temperature , of course .",
    "since the connection between the evolution of the variance and the current auto - correlation function is not restricted to infinite temperature , further investigations may be done in this direction , too .",
    "however , we expect that for low temperatures the convergence of the diffusion constant at finite times is much slower , when the system size is increased .",
