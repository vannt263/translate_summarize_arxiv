    "the equations of gravitation admit topologically non trivial solutions , known as lorentzian wormholes , which connect two regions of the same universe ( or of two universes ) by a throat . in the case of compact wormholes ,",
    "the throat is defined as a minimal area surface @xcite .",
    "wormholes could present features of remarkable interest , including the possibility of time travel ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; but there is an important objection against their actual existence : in einstein gravity the flare - out condition @xcite to be satisfied at the throat of compact wormholes requires exotic matter , that is , matter violating the energy conditions @xcite .",
    "however , in the last few years it was shown that in pure gauss ",
    "bonnet gravity @xcite wormholes could exist even with no matter ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover , in our recent paper @xcite we found 5-dimensional einstein ",
    "bonnet spherical thin - shell wormholes supported by ordinary matter , which were later proven to be stable under perturbations preserving the symmetry @xcite .",
    "but our non exotic construction presented two non desirable aspects : it required a very large charge ( about the critical value ) and a negative gauss ",
    "bonnet parameter @xmath0 .",
    "here we thus revisit thin - shell wormholes in einstein  gauss ",
    "bonnet gravity starting from a different branch of wiltshire solution @xcite , and we focus in the character exotic or normal of matter on the shell in relation with the parameters of the system .",
    "the gauss  bonnet terms of the equations of the theory are associated to the geometry , and not to an effective energy momentum tensor ; thus we work with the darmois ",
    "israel formalism for thin shells @xcite generalized to include the gauss  bonnet contribution @xcite , which allows for a better understanding of the character of the matter on the shell .",
    "we show that for certain values of the parameters , thin - shell wormholes constructed from the exotic branch of wiltshire solution can be supported by non exotic matter even in the case of a relatively small and positive gauss  bonnet constant and even with a vanishing charge .",
    "we shall see that no exotic wormhole configurations are associated to a repulsive far behavior of the mass term of the exotic branch metric .",
    "the einstein  gauss  bonnet equations of gravitation in five spacetime dimensions have the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the cosmological constant , @xmath3 is proportional to the newton constant ( set equal to unity in the units used here ) and @xmath0 is the constant of dimension @xmath4 multiplying the gauss  bonnet terms @xmath5 the matching conditions relating the metrics at the two sides of a given surface @xmath6 with the character of matter on this surface ( the energy - momentum tensor of the shell placed at @xmath6 ) are given by the darmois ",

    "note that in the einstein s gravity framework ( @xmath26 ) , even in @xmath27 dimensions , the energy density could never be positive , thus forbidding wormholes supported by non exotic matter .",
    "however , the second term within the bracket of eq .",
    "( [ s0 ] ) changes this drastically .",

    "( [ f ] ) , for both vanishing @xmath30 and @xmath2 we obtain the far behavior f(r)1- which allows to identify @xmath32 as the adm mass . instead , the metric corresponding to the @xmath33 sign in ( [ f ] )",
    "is usually denoted as the exotic branch , because for @xmath34 and @xmath35 its far behavior is f(r)1++ .",
    "thus for this solution the energy @xmath32 enters in the geometry with the `` wrong '' sign ; consequently , the mass term gives an attractive force on rest particles if @xmath36 , while for @xmath37 the force is repulsive .",
    "besides , this solution would not have the correct general relativity limit for @xmath38 ; instead , it acquires an effective cosmological constant proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "note that for @xmath37 and @xmath40 this geometry has no horizons , but it presents a naked singularity at the origin . in ref .",
    "@xcite thin - shell wormholes were constructed starting from the @xmath31 branch of the metric ; though they could be supported by non exotic matter , this was achieved at the price of a negative value of @xmath0 and a very large charge . therefore , here we shall explore the @xmath33 branch .    to construct a thin - shell wormhole we proceed as usual ( see , for example , the related work @xcite and references therein ) : we take two copies of the spacetime given by ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ f ] ) with @xmath41 and remove from each manifold the five - dimensional regions corresponding to @xmath42 .",
    "the resulting manifolds have boundaries given by the timelike hypersurfaces @xmath43 then the identification of these two surfaces gives a geodesically complete new manifold @xmath44 with a matter shell at the radius @xmath23 , where the throat of the wormhole is located .",
    "note that the throat does not connect two asymptotically flat regions , because the metric diverges for @xmath45 .",
    "but there are no singularities at finite distance , because the origin @xmath46 is removed in the mathematical construction .",
    "we are interested in the possibility of matter fulfilling the weak energy condition @xcite @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( non exotic matter ) , which in our case reduces to @xmath47 , @xmath49 . from the equations ( [ s0 ] ) and ( [ p0 ] ) we obtain ( a)+p(a)=-a(a)/3 , so that the energy condition is fulfilled if @xmath50 and simultaneously @xmath51 . replacing the metric for a vanishing cosmological constant in the expressions for the surface energy - momentum tensor",
    ", we obtain the condition for a positive energy density : @xmath52 we find that working with the exotic branch , for @xmath40 the possibilities of @xmath47 are worse for @xmath53 than for @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , in the subsequent analysis we shall consider a null charge .",
    "also note that if we impose @xmath36 in order to have a far behavior of the mass term corresponding to an attractive force on rest particles , then the condition @xmath47 can not be fulfilled .    from eq .",
    "( [ s+ ] ) we can see that @xmath54 imposes the necessary condition @xmath55 however , a large @xmath0 drags the energy density to negative values because of the first term @xmath56 of eq .",
    "( [ s+ ] ) ; then one expects at most a narrow interval of the parameters to be compatible with a positive energy density .",
    "besides , the sum @xmath57 must also be positive to avoid exotic matter",
    ". from these considerations , it turns out that the most natural approach to answer the question about the existence of wormhole configurations supported by non exotic shells is to draw @xmath58 and @xmath59 for different values of the parameters .",
    "we fix the scale with the mass and take @xmath60 , and then consider different values of the gauss  bonnet constant @xmath0 .",
    "the results are illustrated in figs . 1 and 2 , where the energy density and the sum of it plus the pressure are displayed as functions of the throat radius for some values of interest .",
    "in the mathematical cut and paste construction the singularity is removed , while the absence of horizons allows for the choice of a throat radius as small as desired .",
    "we can see that for relatively small positive values of @xmath0 the weak energy condition can be fulfilled , so that wormholes can be supported by non exotic matter . also , we find that a smaller value of @xmath0 reduces the range of throat radii such that @xmath47 and @xmath49 .",
    "as pointed above , for @xmath36 there is no solution for @xmath47 if we take @xmath40 , so that the energy condition could not be satisfied .",
    "thus if the geometry has a far behavior consistent with an attractive force associated to the mass term , the shells supporting the wormholes must be exotic . instead ,",
    "if the far behavior corresponds to a repulsive force associated to the mass term , non exotic shells supporting the wormholes are possible .",
    "we remark that this result is achieved with a relatively small ( compared with the mass ) positive values of the gauss  bonnet parameter ( see the values in the figures ) , and for a vanishing charge .",
    "we have been able to mathematically construct wormholes supported by a thin layer of normal matter starting from the exotic branch of the spherically symmetric solution of einstein  gauss  bonnet gravity .",
    "we have found that a far behavior of the mass term of the metric corresponding to a repulsion on rest particles is the only possibility compatible with a non exotic thin - shell wormhole . besides , while in the case of the normal branch of the wiltshire metric a negative @xmath0 and a large charge were necessary to make an ordinary matter shell compatible with the existence of a throat @xcite , here we have shown that when the construction starts from the exotic branch the charge does not help but , instead , makes more difficult to fulfill the energy conditions , and that they can be satisfied with a positive gauss ",
