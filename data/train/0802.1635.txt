    "more than a hundred gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) optical afterglows have been detected to date , mostly after observations of grbs by hete - ii @xcite and swift @xcite satellites .",
    "the photometric observations of grb optical afterglows are largely consist of only a few measurements on time scales from several hours to days .",
    "the number of afterglows with the light curves measured in more detail is not large and each of them is of considerable interest .    in this paper",
    "we present our multicolor photometry of the optical afterglow from grb 060526 , carried out with russian - turkish 1.5-m telescope ( rtt150 ) at the tbitak national observatory ( mount bakirlitepe , turkey ) . with rtt150 telescope it was possible to obtain the detailed measurements of afterglow light curve , starting from about 5 hours after the grb and during 5 consecutive nights .",

    "the ground - based observations of the optical transient were started as early as 36 sec after the beginning of gamma - ray burst using an automatic 40-cm telescope @xcite and were continued using larger telescopes @xcite .",

    "the observations were made with @xmath7 binning , which gives 0.48  per bin angular scale .    because of insufficiently good weather conditions on the night of may 26 , the telescope could not be pointed at the afterglow immediately after the bacodine alert was received .",

    "observations were continued until the afterglow faded below the detection limit of telescope in a few hours of the exposure . in order to obtain photometrical calibrations , the observations of @xcite photometric standards",

    "in fig .  [ lc ] the light curve of the afterglow for the entire period of observation is shown .",
    "the data in time interval from 5 to 14 hours after the burst are well fitted by a power law @xmath17 with the index @xmath18 , in agreement with the results of @xcite .",

    "the fading corresponds to the power law with index @xmath22 , also in agreement with @xcite .",

    "in this paper we present the results of detailed observations of the light curve of grb 060526 optical afterglow carried out with russian - turkish 1.5-m telescope ( rtt150 ) .",
    "our observations provide about a half of all photometric measurements obtained for this afterglow .",
    "the upper limits to afterglow variability during the first night of our observations were obtained , and the history of afterglow color changes is measured in detail .",
    "the afterglow observations of grb 060526 were also discussed in detail in the paper by @xcite , who also used our data taken from gcn circulars @xcite , where it was pointed out that the changes of the power law index occurred approximately simultaneously in optical and x - ray bands .",
    "this should be expected in the case if this break occur in result of change of the geometry of the motion of the ejecta .",
    "for example , this may occur when the gamma factor of the jet becomes smaller than the reciprocal of its opening angle and a sideways expansion of the jet begins .",
    "dai et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also discussed the presence of optical variability in the afterglow ( fig .",
    "they noted the presence of flare activity starting from @xmath24  h and found that the @xmath25 relation for these flares poorly satisfies the constraints for various variability models of ultrarelativistic jet @xcite .",
    "our data allow to make even stronger conclusions .",
    "[ lc2d ] shows a segment of the afterglow light curve about two days after the grb .",
    "we see that , according to our measurements , a sharp change occurs in the light curve at @xmath26  days  the brightness declines by @xmath27 in approximately 20 min .",
    "this change corresponds to @xmath28 and @xmath29 the constraints on the variability of the observed emission from an ultrarelativistic jet obtained by @xcite are violated with a large margin .",
    "the main condition from which the constraints on the variability were obtained by @xcite is an ultra - relativistic motion of the jet towards the observer .",
    "actually , however , the jet motion may well become moderately relativistic even on @xmath30  day time scale at higher densities of the ambient interstellar medium or in the presence of dense stellar wind @xcite .",
    "if the motion is no longer ultrarelativistic , then fast variability similar to that discussed above ( fig .",
    "[ lc2d ] ) can be explained much more easily , for example , by the presence of density inhomogeneities in the stellar wind around the grb source .",
    "this may be expected , since the stellar winds around wolf - rayet stars are highly inhomogeneous and have a clumpy structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the sizes of the density inhomogeneities are @xmath31  cm ( figs .",
    "[ lc ] and [ lc2d ] ) .",
    "such inhomogeneities are possible in the winds from wolf - rayet stars at large distances from the star @xcite .",
    "the power law index of the lightcurve at the end of our observations at @xmath21  days , @xmath32 ( fig .  [ lc ] ) seems to be too steep for the non - relativistic stage of shell expansion phase , when the shell expands according to the sedov solution for a strong explosion and the emission is generated by electrons accelerated at the shock front @xcite .",
    "however , this slope is also too steep for the emission of an ultra - relativistic jet after the beginning of its sideways expansion @xcite .",
    "note , that this slope was measured on a very short time scale and may not reflect the rate of afterglow decline on a longer time scales . the sharp decrease in radiation flux after the individual flares can be determined , for example , by the shapes of individual density inhomogeneities or even by the cooling time of optically emitting electrons .",
    "we also note , that the spectral energy distribution in optical and infrared bands is not a power law , already at 9 hours after the burst and during at least a day of observations ( fig .",
    "[ sed ] , [ colors ] ) .",
    "this may suggest that there is a thermal radiation component in the spectrum that can originate only in a nonrelativistic shock , where the particles at the front are not accelerated to ultrarelativistic energies . on the other hand",
    ", this may suggest the presence of absorption in a dense medium around the source .",
    "the observed variability can probably be also explained with the assumption of the ultrarelativistic motion of the jet , for example , assuming the presence of late inner engine activity @xcite . regarding the afterglow from grb 060526 , this question was discussed in detail by @xcite . the explanation related to the transition to subrelativistic motion",
    "is offered here only as a possibility .",
    "this would require a higher density of the ambient interstellar meduim or a dense stellar wind around the source , which are , actually , expected in star - forming regions and around massive wolf - rayet stars ( see also * ? ? ?",
