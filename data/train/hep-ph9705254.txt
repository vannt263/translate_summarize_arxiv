    "a variety of important observables are essentially given by the correlators of currents with different tensorial structure . the cross section for @xmath5 annihilation into hadrons",
    "is governed by the vector current correlator , the @xmath6 decay rate by a combination of vector and axial correlators @xcite .",
    "higgs decays can be expressed by the correlators of the corresponding scalar or pseudo - scalar current densities .",
    "theoretical predictions for all these quantities in one- and two - loop approximation , corresponding to the born level and the order @xmath7 corrections , are available since long .",
    "however , in view of the present or the foreseeable experimental precision improved calculations of these quantities are required , at least up to order @xmath8 , if possible even up to order @xmath9 . for massless quarks the nnlo result is available both for the vector @xcite and the scalar correlators @xcite .",
    "quark mass effects are often incorporated by inclusion of the lowest one or two terms in an expansion in @xmath10 .",
    "this approach is well justified for many applications @xcite .",
    "even for relatively low energy values , down to about three to four times the quark mass this approach leads to an adequate result if sufficiently many terms are included in the expansion @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it is desirable to calculate the correlator for arbitrary values of @xmath10 without directly invoking the high momentum expansion .",
    "recently this was achieved for both real and imaginary parts of the three - loop polarization function @xcite with a heavy quark coupled to an external current . in a first step",
    "the method was applied to the case of the vector current correlator . in this paper also the axial - vector , scalar and pseudo - scalar cases are considered .",
    "this completes the relevant @xmath11 corrections to polarization functions for neutral gauge bosons induced by heavy quarks , more specifically to their `` non - singlet '' parts .",
    "contributions from the double - triangle diagram , giving rise to `` singlet '' contributions , are not considered in this work and will be treated elsewhere .",
    "it is useful to define dimensionless variables : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the external momentum of the polarization function and @xmath14 is the center of mass energy in the process @xmath15 .",
    "then the velocity , @xmath16 , of one of the produced quarks reads @xmath17 every time the generic index @xmath18 appears without further explanation it is understood that @xmath18 represents one of the letters @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "the polarization functions for the four cases of interest are defined by @xmath21 with the currents @xmath22 in eqs .",
    "( [ eqpivadef ] ) and ( [ eqpispdef ] ) two powers of @xmath13 are factored out in order to end up with dimensionless quantities @xmath23 .",
    "as we are only interested in the imaginary part the overall renormalization can be performed in such a way that this is possible .",
    "furthermore we ensure that @xmath24 .",
    "the transformation from this scheme to other ( overall ) renormalization conditions is discussed in app .",
    "[ appmsbar ] . concerning the renormalization",
    "it should be mentioned that for the scalar and pseudo - scalar current the combinations @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the pole mass , have to be considered in order to arrive at finite results .",
    "note that @xmath28 and @xmath29 is trivially obtained from @xmath30 through the axial ward identity @xmath31 .",
    "the physical observable @xmath32 is related to @xmath0 by @xmath33 it is convenient to define @xmath34 and similarly for @xmath35 . the abelian contribution @xmath36 is already present in ( quenched ) qed and @xmath37 originates from the non - abelian structure specific for qcd .",
    "the polarization functions containing a second massless or massive quark loop are denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "@xmath40 represents the double - triangle contribution .",
    "our procedure will be applied to the first three terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqpi2 ] ) , the last two terms will be studied elsewhere .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section the expressions for the polarization functions in the different kinematical regions are provided . in section [ secapprox ]",
    "the approximation method is described and the results are given in section [ secresults ] .",
    "the conclusions are finally presented in section  [ seccon ] .",
    "this section provides a discussion of three kinematical regions where analytical results are available and contains the input data required for the approximation method .      the input from the kinematical region where @xmath41 puts stringent constraints on the form of the polarization function and plays an important rle for our procedure . in the limit of large external momentum the polarization function can be cast into the following form : @xmath42 the coefficients @xmath43 contain @xmath44-terms up to third order . for the subsequental discussion only the terms with @xmath45 and @xmath46 are needed .",
    "these first two terms can be calculated by simply taylor expanding the diagrams in the mass . for the scalar and pseudo - scalar correlator @xcite and up to @xmath47 for the vector correlator",
    "@xcite have been calculated .",
    "this requires also the knowledge of massive tadpole integrals . ]",
    "this leads to massless three - loop integrals for which the technique is known since long @xcite .",
    "the following decomposition of the coefficients @xmath48 is adopted : @xmath49 where @xmath50 are numerical constants . for @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "the sum runs only up to @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
