    "single - top is electroweak top quark production and consists of three different production modes : @xmath4-channel , @xmath7-channel and wt ( associated production ) . of these channels , @xmath4-channel",
    "( figure  [ fig : feynman ] ) has the largest predicted cross - section at the lhc , @xmath8 pb  @xcite , followed by wt ( figure  [ fig : feynman ] ) with @xmath9 pb  @xcite , and s - channel with @xmath10 pb  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the tevatron , where the wt production is the smallest mode  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4-channel cross - section is about 30 times larger at the lhc than at the tevatron , which will give the lhc experiments the opportunity to measure its cross - section with better precision .",
    "single - top production allows tests of the @xmath11 coupling via direct measurements of the ckm matrix element @xmath1  @xcite as well as searches for deviations in the value of this coupling due to flavor changing neutral currents or heavy bosons  @xcite .",

    "later the @xmath4-channel production mode of single - top alone was observed by d0  @xcite .",
    "measurements of single - top t - channel production have also been reported at the lhc by cms  @xcite and by atlas  @xcite , which also reported the first limits on the wt single - top process ( associated production )  @xcite . here",
    ", we will discuss the updated atlas results with 0.7@xmath0 for both the @xmath4-channel  @xcite and wt - channel  @xcite analyses .",
    "the @xmath4-channel production cross - section is measured using both a cut - based and a neural network approach . in both cases the analyses start by reducing the large multijet and w+jets backgrounds through a common event selection which selects for the t - channel final state .",
    "events with at least 2 jets with transverse momentum of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are selected , and the analysis is performed using only the 2-jet or 3-jet multiplicity bins . among the selected jets ,",
    "exactly 1 jet must be b - tagged using a secondary vertex b - tagging algorithm with a 50% b - tagging efficiency and a rejection of 270 for light - quarks",
    ". events with exactly 1 isolated , central ( @xmath14 ) muon or electron with @xmath12 are selected and where each of these leptons must be associated with a corresponding lepton trigger .",
    "the events are also required to have missing transverse energy , @xmath15 to account for the undetected neutrino from the w decay .",
    "events where the w boson decays into hadrons are not considered in these analyses . finally , @xmath16 is required to further reduce multijet contributions , where @xmath17 is the reconstructed transverse mass of the w determined from the lepton and .",
    "after all of these selections , the signal yield divided by the background yield ( s / b ) is approximately 0.1 .",
    "a few different approaches are used to determine the background normalizations and shapes .",
    "for the , wt , @xmath7-channel , diboson , and z+jets backgrounds the theoretical cross - sections are used . for",
    "the multijet estimate a `` jet - electron '' method is used , where the normal electron trigger is replaced by a jet trigger .",
    "the normalization is determined by a binned maximum likelihood fit to the   distribution in data  @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : met ] .",
    "this method is used in both the electron and muon channels .    for the dominant w+jets backround",
    "there are two different methods employed to determine the normalization and heavy flavor fractions from data . in the cut - based analysis ,",
    "the overall normalization is determined from the 2 jet sample after the intial selection ( tag ) but without the b - tagged jet selection ( pretag ) .",
    "the heavy flavor composition of the w+light jets , wc+jets , and the combined wc@xmath18+jets and wb@xmath19+jets proportions are determined using three orthogonal off - signal regions : 1 jet tag , 2 jet pretag , and 2 jet tag ( excluding events selected by the cut - based analysis ) .",
    "the neural network analysis uses a fit of the neural network output distribution to determine the w+jets normalization and heavy flavor composition .",
    "after the background estimates and initial event selection there is good agreement between the data and signal plus background model , as seen in the variable distributions in figure  [ fig : topmasspresel ] .",
    "-channel analyses are shown after the initial selection , including reconstructed top mass distribution after initial event selection for the two jet selection ( top left ) , three jet selection ( top right ) , untagged jet @xmath20 for the two jet selection ( bottom left ) , and legend ( bottom right ) .",

    "this analysis uses four different channels ( where each channel can contain both electron and muon channel events ) : 2 and 3 jet events with positively or negatively charged leptons .",
    "this channel division makes use of the expected lepton charge asymmetry from the proton - proton collisions due to the excess of valence u - quarks compared to valence d - quarks .",
    "this is different than a proton - antiproton collider , where no asymmetry would be expected .",
    "after the event selection the best channel is the 2 jet events with positively charged leptons channel followed by the 3 jet events with positively charged leptons channel .",
    "these are the best channels particularly due to their larger proportion of signal versus   in the positively charged lepton channel , due to   production being symmetric in the lepton charge channels . also , there is a lower proportion of 2 jet   events than 3 jet   events , as the typical   event has 4 jets .",
    "the cut - based selections are particularly helpful in reducing the other large background , w+jets , which is asymmetric in lepton charge , like the signal , and appears more often in the 2 jet bin than the 3 jet bin .",
    "specifically , after all cut - based analysis selections in the 2 jet ( 3 jet ) channel with a postively charged lepton about 94 events ( 83 events ) are expected overall with an expected signal yield of about 52 events ( 33 events ) giving an expected s / b ratio of 1.2 ( 0.7 ) , as shown in table  [ tab : sb ] .",
    "this improvement can also be seen for 2 and 3 jet events with the positive and negative lepton channels combined in figure  [ fig : topmassafterpresel ] , which shows the distributions in figure  [ fig : topmasspresel ] but with the additional cut - based analysis selections ( except the reconstructed top mass selection ) applied .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : sbwt ]    the wt cross - section and limit are extracted using a profile likelihood technique , the same method used in the @xmath4-channel cut - based analysis .",
    "the resulting cross - section is @xmath27 pb . the 95% cl upper limit on the production of wt events is @xmath5 pb observed , @xmath28 pb expected .",
    "the total expected uncertainty on the wt limit is + 77% - 75% with + 68% -66% due to systematic uncertainties .",
    "the data statistical uncertainty for this result is still large , + 37% , -35% , so more data will improve this result",
    ". however , there are also some large systematic uncertainties with values of about 30% , particularly jet energy scale , jet energy resolution , and jet reconstruction efficiency .",
    "atlas @xmath4-channel and wt single - top cross - section results are estimated using 0.7@xmath0 of data taken with 7 tev proton - proton collisions .",
