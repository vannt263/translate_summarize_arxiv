    "molecular clouds are highly dynamic environments and understanding the effects that their internal , supersonic turbulent motions have on the process of gravitational collapse is critical towards understanding how stars form .",
    "the turbulent fragmentation picture of star formation posits that star formation is regulated by the turbulent motions of the molecular cloud ; turbulent fluctuations can support the cloud on large scale while also creating compressions that can become gravitationally unstable , wherein protostellar cores form after 1 - 2 free - fall times ; 0.5 - 1 myr ( eg . , reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the traditional paradigm of star formation , which supposes that a prestellar core in a magnetically subcritical cloud contracts quasistatically as the magnetic field slowly leaks out due to ambipolar diffusion on time - scales of several myr ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our goal in this and the previous paper ( @xcite @xcite , tp04 hereafter ) is to understand the origin of star clusters , in particular the origin of the distribution of molecular cloud cores ( and their physical properties ) out of which cluster stars are formed .",
    "numerical investigations of turbulence within gmcs have shown that turbulent fragmentation is remarkably successful in producing clusters of stars @xcite .",
    "many of the observed statistical properties of cluster - forming regions in molecular clouds can be reproduced by these models , including :    \\(i ) _ the apparent relation between internal velocity dispersions and size _ @xcite ;    \\(ii ) _ the similarity with the observed distribution of core masses _",
    "( @xcite ; tp04 ; @xcite ) - wherein the numerical data shares many of the key features of observed star - forming region , such as the ( salpeter ) @xmath4 power - law relationship at large masses between number of cores of a given mass and the core mass and a turnover at low masses @xcite ;    \\(iii ) _ the similarity of the core mass function to the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) _",
    "( @xcite ) ;    \\(iv ) _ the similarity of the angular momentum of cores with observed rotations of cores _",
    "( @xcite , tp04)- which are consistent with observations of velocity gradients in molecular clouds @xcite , and several orders of magnitude greater than the angular momenta of main - sequence stars ; and    \\(v ) _ the moderate efficiency of star formation within dense clumps _ wherein a fraction of the gas in these models collects in the cores , up to 30 - 40% in models of decaying turbulence ( @xcite;tp04 ; @xcite ) .",
    "models with driven turbulence predict lower star formation efficiencies ( e.g. @xcite ) , and it has been suggested that the star formation needs to be spread out over several dynamical times @xcite .",
    "our previous work on purely hydrodynamic turbulence in self - gravitating gas ( tp04 ) found that only a few initial jeans masses are needed to create a cluster of prestellar cores .",
    "this is because the shocks and compressions create local density enhancements with much reduced local jeans masses ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the point here is that since the local jeans mass is inversely proportional to the square root of the density , it can become significantly easier to form collapsing cores in these density enhancements .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend our investigation to include the role that magnetic fields can play in turbulent fragmentation .",
    "magnetic fields can play a role in principle because of the well known fact that they change the condition for gravitational stability . in a uniform magnetized medium ,",
    "the condition for collapse is most physically measured by the magnetic criticality parameter ( or mass - to - flux ratio ) @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a surface density of the gas and b is its magnetic field strength . in situations in which the magnetic field is weak compared to gravity ",
    "the so - called magnetically supercritical case , @xmath7  gravitational collapse is expected .",
    "the subcritical configuration ( @xmath8 ) has magnetic fields strong enough to support the cloud against gravitational collapse , and is thus expected to be stable .",
    "a condensation can collapse only if the magnetic field can escape via ambipolar diffusion , reducing the magnetic flux and thus increasing @xmath9 ( e.g. @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that it is possible for turbulence to enhance this diffusion rate , thus hastening the transition from subcritical to supercritical behaviour , but it is not clear if the cores formed from this type of process resemble gmc cores .    given that the unmagnetized simulations have had such success - what role does the magnetic field play ?",
    "based on the previous paragraph , it is obvious that in regions within the cloud wherein the field is too strong ( and couples ideally to the gas ) , magnetic forces can prevent collapse from occurring .",
    "this has been confirmed in simulations of subcritical mhd turbulence ( e.g. @xcite ) , although it has been suggested that the magnetic field can leak out of condensations via turbulence - enhanced ambipolar diffusion in reasonable time - scales , producing supercritical cores out of subcritical regions @xcite .",
    "if the initial cloud is magnetically supercritical , collapse will occur .",
    "another important consideration that is not well handled by idealized analytical models of clouds is the fact that geometry of the magnetic field is important since the field does not resist motions parallel to it . a third factor that makes magnetic fields potentially interesting",
    "is that any rotation within the cores can generate torsional alfvn waves that can carry away excess angular momentum and possibly generate jets while affecting the fragmentation of the disk that will ultimately form @xcite .",
    "do these important effects influence the efficiency of forming bound cores in turbulence ?    in this paper , we examine the effect of a magnetic field in addition to turbulence in self - gravitating , cluster - forming clumps within gmcs .",
    "we perform an exhaustive examination of the contributions to the virial equation from the thermal , kinetic , gravitational , magnetic and surface terms of the fluctuations that are produced by the turbulence .",
    "we use the virial equation to identify the objects that are bound or collapsing , which we identify as cores. the cores are confined through a combination of thermal , dynamic and magnetic surface pressure , and gravity .",
    "the virial equation provides a useful guide to determine the forces acting on the cores . in a turbulent environment",
    ", the surface pressure terms can have a significant role in confining the core ( @xcite , tp04 ) .",
    "an apparent equipartition , at least in a statistical sense , develops between the internal kinetic energy and the gravitational energy ( tp04,@xcite ) .",
    "we find that strong initial magnetic fields ( @xmath10 ) can indeed have a large effect on the resulting evolution of the cloud and result in collapse to large sheets .",
    "there is little evidence for such prevalent structures from observations however , and we use this to constrain the physical parameters of our simulations to uncover the conditions that are most favourable to the formation of observed star clusters . the simulations that initially have large @xmath9 appear to do much better at reproducing the observed trends seen in molecular cloud mass functions .",
    "these simulations can still produce cores with local values of @xmath9 that are close to critical , as the cores are produced when the turbulence breaks up the fluid into parcels with smaller masses and magnetic fluxes than the original computational domain .",
    "we also find good agreement between our core properties with ammonia surveys of cores in clustered star formation regions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we also use our numerical data to compute the angular momenta and spin rates for the cores in our simulations .",
    "we find that the angular momenta are on the order of @xmath11 , comparable to measurements of gmc cores @xcite .",
    "the distribution of core spins that we find suggests to us that the binary frequency of stars that form within these objects , must be high .",
    "this work , wherein we compare our results with a wide variety of observations of cloud cores , shows that the strong magnetization of cores that is often observed is the result of local compression by the turbulence , and is not characteristic of the entire volume of the cloud .",
    "this and other results suggest that it is turbulence , and not the wide - spread influence of a powerful cloud magnetic field , that is central to the origin of core formation and core properites and ultimately , the origin of the imf .    the setup of our simulations is described in section 2 , and focuses mainly on the differences from the simulations in tp04 . in section 3 , we describe the overall results of the simulations , noting especially the morphological structure that is produced . in section 4 , we examine the dynamical state of the cores and condensations that form .",
    "we present , in section 5 , the distribution functions of many physical properties of cores , including their masses , angular momenta , spins , radii , average densities , magnetizations and mass - to - flux ratios .",
    "we compare these with the observations and use them to test theoretical models of turbulent fragmentation .",

    "we remove waves longer than 1/8 the length of the box in order to minimize the effects of the periodicity of the box on the kinematics .",
    "we also imposed an exponential cutoff on short wavelengths , to eliminate fluctuations in the initial conditions on scales we are not able to properly resolve .",
    "this spectrum is illustrated in a later figure .",
    "the initial velocity field is purely solenoidal , but otherwise each plane wave is given a random phase and direction .",
    "we do not provide any forcing of the turbulence at later timesteps ; the initial kinetic energy is allowed to decay freely .",
    "after @xmath22 shock - crossing time , the turbulence is fully developed .",
    "the initial magnetic field is uniform in strength and direction .",
    "we characterize its initial strength through the ratio of thermal energy to magnetic energy , @xmath23 we select a range of @xmath1 between 0.1 and 50.0 ( the zeeman measurements of @xcite suggest @xmath24 ) ; the initial parameter space of @xmath25 is plotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig_simic ] ) .",
    "the list of our various model parameters is given in table [ table_ic ] , where models with initial jeans number @xmath26 and @xmath27 are designated with letters b,c,d or e respectively .",
    "the following number is the rms mach number of the initial turbulence spectrum ; all of our simulations save one ( e14b ) were run with a turbulent mach number @xmath28 .",
    "we chose this value because experience with our hydrodynamic studies ( which featured models similar to our b models ) showed this to be a good regime for vigorous turbulent fragmentation into a well - populated cmf .",
    "the final , lower - case letter gives an indication of the strength of the initial magnetic field , with @xmath29 indicated respectively by a , b , c , d , e .",
    "the turbulent amplitude can also be viewed in terms of the alfvn mach number , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the signal speed of mhd transverse waves .",

    "thus , all the simulations in this paper were performed in the mildly to strongly super - alfvnic regime .",
    "the initial level of turbulent kinetic energy is greater than the gravitational self - energy of the cloud , but as the turbulence decays the gravitational force will begin to dominate the dynamics .",
    "another important characteristic of the magnetic field that is useful in determining the behaviour of the fluid is whether it is magnetically supercritical or subcritical .",
    "as already noted , a magnetically supercritical fluid has sufficient mass for gravity to overwhelm magnetic support and go into collapse ; a magnetically subcritical",
    "fluid does not have enough mass , and thus will not collapse gravitationally .",
    "the critical mass to flux ratio  which is the ratio of the gravitational to magnetic energies in a parcel of gas of density @xmath35 , size @xmath36 and magnetic field strength @xmath37  can be rewritten as @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we plot our initial simulation models in our 2-d parameter space ( @xmath1,@xmath39 ) in fig .",
    "( [ fig_simic ] ) , where the solid lines correspond to constant values of @xmath9 .",
    "the value @xmath40 is the dividing line between supercritical and subcritical magnetic fields and collapse will occur for @xmath7 .",
    "the scaling of the critical parameter in equation ( [ eq_gamma_def ] ) with our two fundamental parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath39 , shows that strongly magnetized cores ( @xmath41 ) can still be supercritical if the initial number of jeans masses @xmath39 is sufficiently large ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "thus , sufficient gravity ( i.e. large @xmath39 ) can still leave a strongly magnetized cloud supercritical .",
    "our simulations were run until we could not properly resolve the collapse everywhere on the grid , a process that generally took about 3 flow - crossing times to occur . when scaled to the initial values of l in table [ table_ic ] , this is @xmath430.5 myr , consistent with observations that star formation generally lasts less than a few myr @xcite .",
    "we used the local jeans length as our criterion for this resolution , calculated for each cell using the density of that cell .",
    "the simulation stopped when the local jeans length of a cell somewhere on the grid was less than four zones @xcite ( this is equivalent to an increase in density of @xmath44 over the initial density of the simulation ; for our simulation values of @xmath45 $ ] this corresponds to final - to - initial density ratios of 450 - 1500 ) .",
    "this criterion was established for simulations in the absence of magnetic fields ; @xcite have suggested a more stringent criterion of resolving the jeans length by at least six zones when magnetic fields are included .",
    "however , our results should not be contaminated by artificial fragmentation due to our less stringent criterion as we stop the simulations immediately upon the violation of this criterion , and the collapse of the region that violates this condition is happening on much faster time - scales than the dynamics anywhere else on the computational grid . as a result ,",
    "any instabilities that might result due to violation of the more stringent heitsch et al .",
    "criterion will not have a chance to propagate to other cells before the simulation ends .",
    "these simulations are scale - free , and can thus , in theory at least , be scaled to any size or mass .",
    "however , it is not necessarily physical to do so . as in tp04",
    "we chose the initial conditions from among the range of clumps and cores seen in the @xcite survey ; these are cores with masses between @xmath46 and sizes between @xmath47 pc ; they contain @xmath48 jeans masses , assuming they are at a temperature of 20 k. this is roughly the range we expect our simulations to scale while still being representative of clumps and cores ; at larger scales , we would expect clouds to have many more jeans masses .",
    "the mass , size and magnetic field of our simulations scale as @xmath49      we identify individual condensations in our simulations through the application of a watershed algorithm @xcite that we developed in tp04 .",
    "this algorithm efficiently identifies cores by identifying the local gradient vector at each point .",
    "a path is then traced , from zone to zone , following the local gradient vector of each cell until a local maximum is reached . all zones along this path",
    "are assigned to a core marked by that local maximum .",
    "see tp04 for details , including a comparison with the clumpfind algorithm of @xcite .",
    "as the algorithm by default is sensitive to small fluctuations , it tends to break up larger cores into multiple smaller cores .",
    "we reduce the influence of this effect on our results by applying the core - finding algorithm to the density field , smoothed with a gaussian kernel with a width of 3 zones .",
    "this significantly reduces the number of small - scale cores that we find .",
    "the structures that form in our simulations are shown in figs .",
    "[ magfield_b5c]-[magfield_e14a ] , and are delineated by isodensity contours and magnetic field lines .",
    "we find that there is a clear trend in the results for the fluid to flow preferentially along the magnetic field lines , rather than perpendicular to the fields @xcite .",
    "this effect is naturally more significant in the simulation runs with stronger magnetic fields ( i.e. lower @xmath1 and , in particular , low @xmath9 ) .",
    "the simulations with a mean magnetic field strength that is closer to the critical magnetic field strength show that fluid motions perpendicular to the mean magnetic field are reduced , while motions parallel to the mean field are not significantly affected . in this regime",
    "the material forms a sheet that then fragments .",
    "the formation of a sheet is a well - known behaviour of subcritical cores @xcite , although such clouds would not be able to collapse in the absence of ambipolar diffusion @xcite .",
    "however , we have a sheet forming in a marginally supercritical cloud .",
    "we still show in sections ( [ section_formation ] ) and ( [ section_distribution ] ) that the cores that form within this sheet have different statistical properties from observed cores and are unlikely to be representative of star - forming regions .",
    "the fluid in the low @xmath1 simulations initially clumps together locally , forming many small condensations .",
    "these condensations are gravitationally attracted to each other , but the component of the motion perpendicular to the field lines is not generally strong enough to exert a significant perpendicular velocity unless the magnetic field is strongly subcritical .",
    "these fluid condensations will instead flow along the field lines , until the gravitational force parallel to the field is reduced as a sheet forms .",
    "as this sheet builds up in mass , the gravitational forces transverse to the field become strong enough to cause local collapse in several parts of the sheet , that then experience the typical runaway growth of a gravitationally collapsing object .",
    "this results in several massive cores at the point where we are forced to stop the simulation due to violation of the jeans criterion , as opposed to the non - magnetic and strongly subcritical runs where one object tends to runaway before any other condensations are significantly evolved .",
    "furthermore , the separation of the simulation into a high - density sheet and low - density envelope divides the condensations found into two distinct categories : those with a high average density ( in the sheet ) , and those with a low average density ( in the atmosphere ) .",
    "we show in section ( [ section_distribution ] ) that these two sets have distinct properties ; as a result , these sheets do not look like places where clusters of stars will form .",
    "the magnetic field in a turbulent molecular cloud can become quite complex , as shown for two of our runs , c5d and e14b , in figs .",
    "[ magfield_c5d ] and [ magfield_e14a ] .",
    "oblique shocks generate vortical motions in the gas which in turn drive torsional alfvn waves that propagate through the fluid , resulting in the twisting and tangled structures we see in these two figures .",
    "these propagating torsional waves create regions of helical magnetic field as described in theoretical work by @xcite and which may have been observed in zeeman observations @xcite .",
    "the field lines can get quite twisted and tangled , even with a relatively strong magnetic field , as shown in figs .",
    "[ magfield_b5c]-[magfield_closeup ] .",
    "the net direction of the initial field is readily apparent , as magnetic flux is conserved to numerical accuracy .",
    "we also show a series of close - up views around the third most massive core ( zooming in by factors of 2 and 8/3 ) in run e14b in fig .",
    "[ magfield_closeup ] , which is typical of the mid - mass isolated bound cores produced in these simulations .",
    "we chose this particular core to show the details around cores that have not begun to experience a runaway collapse .",
    "we can also see the proximity of this core to two smaller , nearby cores .",
    "the field lines around the target core are not strongly tangled . as there is less turbulent energy on small scales ( by virtue of the kolmogorov spectrum )",
    ", it is perhaps not too surprising that the fluid motions are unable to tangle up the field to a significant degree in these smaller cores .",
    "no pinching of the field due to gravitational collapse is seen , as the mass - to - flux ratio for this core is @xmath50 .",
    "examining the virial terms we can see that this core is bound primarily due to the presence of a surface pressure ; gravity is only responsible for @xmath51% of the virial confinement .",
    "this core contains @xmath52 zones , so it is well - resolved ; it has a density ratio between centre and surface of @xmath53 , with a central density ( when scaled to the initial simulation values in table [ table_ic ] ) corresponding to @xmath54 .",
    "we note that this is not the core that underwent runaway collapse that stopped the simulation , and we do see evidence of focusing in the magnetic field lines there , but it is remarkable that these cores have grown so large without significant motions transverse to the initial field .    any rotation of cores like these would be expected to generate torsional waves that extract their angular momentum .",
    "we see some evidence for this in the twisting of the field lines beneath the core even though this core has not had enough time to fully rotate . moreover , in this particular core , we find that the angular momentum vector @xmath55 and mean magnetic field @xmath56 are misaligned by 45 degrees .",
    "we examine this in greater detail in a subsequent paper , but note that similar studies have suggested that cores do not strongly align with either local or global magnetic field directions @xcite .",
    "we present simulated line profiles along with a column density contour map for run e14b in fig .",

    "the top row uses a line - of - sight parallel to the mean field .",

    "these line profiles ( shown in the right - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_linemap ] ) are calculated in the same way as tp04 , by summing along each line - of - sight the density value of each zone multiplied by a gaussian exponential term centered on the line - of - sight velocity of that zone ; the width of the gaussian is determined by the amount of thermal broadening expected for a gas at a temperature of 20k .",

    "the line profiles all tend to have similar amplitudes .",
    "the profiles become noticeably more asymmetric near the regions of highest column density as material streams on to the large cores through channeling by the magnetic field .",

    "we also find that significant numbers of subcritical cores can be produced , even in the simulations that start in a highly supercritical state .",
    "this important result suggests that the observed near - critical mass - to - flux ratios of @xcite can develop from a cloud that is initially supercritical .",
    "thus , it is possible to avoid the sheet - like collapse behaviour of an initially near - critical cloud while still producing near - critical cores similar to those seen in star - forming regions .    in the low-@xmath9",

    "the collapse into these sheets preferentially occurs along field lines , the magnetic field strength both inside and outside of the sheet is approximately constant ; since @xmath61 , the density contrast between sheet and environment is directly reflected in the @xmath1 distribution for these marginally supercritical runs .",
    "it is apparent that in these marginally supercritical simulations , the magnetic field is not significantly compressed .      a quantity that has proved useful in determining whether a collapsing core fragments is the product of @xmath63 , the mean angular rotation rate of the core , and @xmath64 , the free - fall time at the centre of the core @xcite .",

    "the peak of these distributions are between @xmath3 , densities that are well - traced by ammonia maps ( although it should be noted , we chose our initial conditions so that this would be true ) and again agree with @xcite who characterize bound cores through ammonia surveys .",
    "we have presented a detailed examination of the physical properties of cluster forming cores as they arise in simulations of decaying turbulence in magnetized , turbulent `` clumps '' within molecular clouds .",
    "this effort is aimed at trying to understand the origin of the core mass function , as well as many other properties of cores and eventually , the stars that form within them . in pursuing this goal ,",
    "we have been careful to examine all of the physical forces that are acting upon the fluctuations in our simulations - our virial analysis of cores is the most exhaustive analysis we can find in the literature .",
    "our results are also not sensitive to the nature of the initial spectrum of the velocity field fluctuations that is imposed on the simulations .",
    "we find that an initial turbulent , magnetized molecular cloud must be significantly supercritical if its subsequent fragmentation is to resemble at all the properties of evolved molecular cloud cores that we see today .",
    "the cores that are produced in these highly supercritical simulations can still have ( local ) mass - to - flux ratios that are close to critical , reproducing the trends seen by @xcite for observed cores .",
    "simulations that are not initially significantly supercritical preferentially collapse along field lines to form sheets , and the fragmentation of these sheets produce much flatter mass distributions .",
    "we obtain a distribution of masses for the bound cores that shows a power - law at large masses for simulations that began with moderately supercritical magnetic fields .",
    "the peak of these mass distributions are robustly found at 0.001 - 0.01 times the initial jeans mass of the simulation .",
    "we fit these core mass distributions with the theoretical mass spectrum of @xcite and generally obtain reasonable fits to the _ shape _ of the core mass spectra using their model ( albeit with fewer very - low - mass cores produced than expected by the padoan - nordlund mass spectrum ) .",
    "cores that are only marginally supercritical have a significantly flatter mass distribution , and do not appear to develop a clear power - law at large masses . however , the _ peak mass _ of the core mass spectra in our simulations are not well fit by this model . in particular , there is little sensitivity of the peak mass in our simulations to the initial mach number of the turbulence as proposed by their model .",
    "the bound cores that are produced have specific angular momenta that , when scaled to appropriate physical units , are on the order of @xmath69 . on the basis of these spin rates and the detailed collapse calculations of @xcite and @xcite , many of these cores are likely to further fragment during the course of their collapse , likely leading to the formation of binary or multiple systems .",
    "we find that the bound cores have a distribution of magnetization ( @xmath1 ) that has a median value that is approximately the same as the mean @xmath1 of the simulation .",
    "the mass - to - flux ratio ( @xmath9 ) of these cores , however , is generally less than the mass - to - flux ratio of the original simulation , by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "this suggests that a distribution of cores can be produced that have mass - to - flux ratios that are close to critical ( as seen by @xcite ) from a cloud that is initially highly supercritical .",
    "the distribution of core radii is a narrowly peaked function centered at 0.02 - 0.2 pc .",
    "the distribution of core densities peaks at the mean density of the simulation , but is skewed towards higher densities due to gravitational collapse . the marginally supercritical runs develop a double peak in their density distributions , with the one peak arising from the cores collapsing in a dense sheet and the other from cores in the low density surroundings .",
    "we conclude that simulations of magnetized , decaying turbulence can provide an excellent account of the core mass functions and a wide range of core properties in such clouds .",
    "the role of magnetic fields can indeed be very significant in the dynamics of molecular clouds and their cluster forming cores .",
    "indeed our best fits to a wide variety of observations of cloud cores suggest that the strong magnetization of cores that is often observed is the result of compression by the turbulence , and is not characteristic of the entire volume of the cloud .",
    "this further suggests that turbulence , and not wide spread cloud magnetic field , lies at the heart of the origin of core formation and the origin of the imf .",
