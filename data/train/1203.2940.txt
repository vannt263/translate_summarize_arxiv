    "uncovering the pathway by which sub - micron dust grains grow into gravitationally bound bodies suitable for building planets is a long - standing problem .",
    "pairwise collisions between dust particles in protoplanetary discs are thought to drive rapid growth up to @xmath1 mm sizes @xcite . beyond this size scale , continued growth up to the km - scale of planetesimals is potentially frustrated by two distinct physical barriers .",
    "first , the measured material properties of solid aggregates , which favor sticking upon collision for small sizes , switch to favour bouncing @xcite , or collisional fragmentation due to high , turbulence - driven velocity dispersions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for @xmath2 .",
    "even if these barriers could be surmounted , however , direct collisional growth faces a second obstacle from headwind drag @xcite , which becomes extremely strong for particles in the cm to m - size range .",
    "the loss of substantial quantities of solids into the star is not in itself deleterious  indeed the relatively small solid mass in the minimum mass solar nebula @xcite indicates loss probably occurred  but the residence time of critically coupled particles is so short that it is hard to see how catastrophic depletion could be averted if bodies grow steadily through m - scales .",
    "these considerations have led to renewed interest in collective mechanisms for planetesimal formation , which appeal ( typically ) to gravitational instability in a dense particle layer @xcite to effect a dynamical time scale jump from mm or cm - sizes to km - scales ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "several precursor mechanisms have been proposed that might act to create conditions locally favourable for gravitational instability .",
    "they include vertical settling @xcite , turbulent concentration @xcite , and streaming instabilities @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence that these mechanisms could form surprisingly large first - generation planetesimals ( @xmath3 ) , of a size consistent with that derived  by combining the measured size distribution with the results of collisional - grinding simulations  for the primordial asteroid belt @xcite .    which , if any , of these mechanisms is responsible for planetesimal formation is hard to say , since their feasibility depends in part on the uncertain properties of the intrinsic turbulence within the disc @xcite .",
    "some theoretical constraints are nonetheless possible , since most of the formation - via - collapse models require local enhancement of the height - averaged dust - to - gas ratio ( the local disc metallicity ) above solar values in order to exceed the threshold for gravitational instability .",
    "the magnitude of the required enhancement varies both with the model , and with the properties of the gas disc , but typical values quoted vary between roughly 2 and 10 times standard metallicity @xcite . either a local build - up of solids or a local depletion of gas @xcite would be equally effective .",
    "further clues come from observations . to match solar system constraints , conditions for",
    "planetesimal formation must extend over a significant radial range ( because planetesimals formed with substantially distinct compositions ) and persist for a large fraction of the disc lifetime .",
    "the evidence for an extended era of planetesimal formation comes from age dating of primitive meteorites , and in particular from the finding that the chondrules within those meteorites differ in age by as much as 2.5  myr @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent age - dating of iron - core meteorites suggests the era of planetesimal formation extended nearly as far back as the beginning of solar - system history , as defined by the formation of calcium - aluminium - rich inclusions ( cais ) @xcite .",
    "the replenishment of cold dust in debris discs @xcite implies that planetesimal populations around other stars are not solely confined to the inner disc , but there is no observational requirement that planetesimal formation spans the entire range of radii where gas was once present .",
    "given this , one obvious way to create an enhancement of the dust - to - gas ratio at small to intermediate disc radii is to appeal to the large reservoir of mass typically present further out . if small particles spiralling inward pile - up as they migrate radially , then the  problem \" of headwind drag becomes instead a necessary ingredient for planetesimal formation . in a static ( inviscid ) disc model ,",
    "headwind drag acting on an initially uniform dust - to - gas ratio does in fact result in just such a pile - up , with peak values of the enhancement exceeding those needed to produce gravitational collapse via vertical sedimentation @xcite . although not the focus of the original work , radial pile - ups would also result in highly favorable conditions for triggering streaming instabilities .",
    "inviscid - disc models , which assume that the gas has neither a net radial flow nor local turbulent motions , include only the minimal set of potential aerodynamic effects that can modify the radial particle distribution .",
    "such models also provide a poor representation of the global disc environment , which is expected ( and observed , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to change substantially over the time period of interest for planetesimal formation .",
    "our goal in this paper is to quantify the variation in the dust - to - gas ratio if the gas disc , instead of being static , evolves with time under the action of local turbulent transport of angular momentum and photoevaporation .",
    "headwind drag will still occur in an evolving disc , but the propensity of particles to pile - up will additionally be affected by several new processes ,    * the global evolution of the gas disc , which thins with time and whose outer edge must expand radially to conserve angular momentum as gas is accreted on to the star . * radial advection with the flow of disc gas , which may counter the slow - down of drift that leads to pileup in the inner disc . * turbulent diffusion . * disc - clearing photoevaporation .",
    "the first three of these processes ( also explored in , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are ultimately byproducts of the same turbulence within the disc , so the inclusion of evolution introduces fewer independent parameters into a calculation of particle transport than one might at first fear .",
    "indeed , the primary conclusion of our work is that a range of disc models all produce roughly the same result : as the disc evolves , the outer disc becomes depleted of solids , but the lost material does not pile - up significantly in the inner disc .",
    "instead , the inner disc maintains roughly its primordial dust - to - gas ratio as the disc drains away .",
    "as time progresses , the thinning gas supports successively smaller particle sizes across the range of solar system radii .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in  [ methods ] we outline the one dimensional disc evolution and particle transport models that we employ .",
    "these models immediately specify the radial dependence of several critical time scales relevant to particle transport , and in  [ consequences ] we discuss the elementary consequences of those time scales for dust evolution . in  [ results ] ,",
    "we show the dust distributions resulting from our simulations , which we compare in  [ results_venhancements ] to the dust - to - gas enhancements thought necessary to lead to precipitation ( formation via vertical sedimentation as in @xcite ) of large bodies , and , briefly in  [ compareobservations ] , to observations of dust in discs around other stars .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for planetesimal formation models in  [ discussionconclusions ] .",

    "the disc - evolution model also includes photoevaporation at the end of the disc lifetime due to @xmath27 photons s@xmath28 of euv radiation , as in @xcite , equation ( 1 ) .",
    "we assume that the viscosity in equation  ( [ ealpha_prescription ] ) derives from a local turbulent stress @xcite . in this case ,",
    "both the evolution of the gas disc profile , and the magnitude of the particle diffusivity , @xmath29 , share a common scaling with the midplane disc temperature , @xmath30 .",

    "we compute these terms using standard methods ( detailed in appendix  [ ax_disctemp ] ) , assuming a constant dust - to - gas ratio ( i.e. , ignoring coupling to the evolving dust distribution ) . for computational economy ,",

    "however , at the time - scales / masses and accretion rates considered in our models , disc surface - density evolution is nearly identical using either a static or evolving temperature distribution .",
    "we have also verified that using a fit to the evolving temperature distribution , rather than calculating it in each dust - transport simulation at every @xmath41 , does not affect our dust - distribution results .",
    "the disc - gas radial velocity , @xmath42 , is calculated using the 1d accretional velocity derived due to the viscous evolution of the disc surface - density profile .",
    "@xmath43    this accretion - flow velocity is predominantly inward but includes outward flow at the outer edge of the expanding disc . the inclusion of the accretion velocity of the gas marks one of the primary differences between our evolving - disc model and the inviscid - disc model of @xcite .",
    "it is important because , for a typical gas surface density profile ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 does not decrease toward smaller disc radii , unlike the headwind - drag velocity .",
    "we note , however , that it is possible for discs to evolve without there being a significant accretion flow at the disc midplane .",
    "this situation occurs in dead - zone models @xcite , in which vertical variation in the efficiency of angular momentum transport results in gas accretion that occurs primarily along the disc surface .",
    "qualitatively , we expect that particle transport within dead - zone disc models would differ substantially depending on whether the scale height of the particle disc was large enough for the particles to experience the ( rapid ) surface layer flow .",
    "however , more detailed study of these models is left to others .",

    "we use the particle - transport code outlined in @xcite to evolve the dust distribution , which is modeled as an ensemble of particles .",

    "the random walk is asymmetric , with the weighting between the inward and outward steps calculated from the local disc conditions so as to recover the evolution of a fluid model @xcite .",
    "gas drag is calculated assuming that particles experience epstein drag appropriate to their size .",
    "the epstein drag regime is appropriate for the vast majority of the disc s radial and temporal extent , though the largest grains considered ( cm - sized ) technically fall within the stokes - drag regime in the innermost disc ( @xmath55  au ) at very early times .",

    "we assume spherical grains of internal density 1 g @xmath62 , and vary the grain radius , @xmath63 .",

    "laboratory experiments and coagulation models show that bouncing and collisional fragmentation represent barriers to further growth @xcite .",
    "the precise value of the critical size depends upon the gas disc conditions , and is not precisely known .",
    "we assume 2  cm as the upper - limit grain size for tracking a global dust distribution . except in the case of instantaneous grain growth ( discussed in   [ results_varymodel ] ) , our simulation results are qualitatively identical for maximum assumed grain sizes as small as 0.2  mm .    the local velocity for turbulent diffusion is , @xmath65 where @xmath29 is the local diffusivity of the particle ensemble .",
    "we use the @xcite scaling for the particle radial diffusivity , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the gas - particle diffusivity , and @xmath68 is the normalized gas - drag stopping time . in general",
    "we assume a schmidt number of @xmath69 , but also run simulations in the fiducial - disc model using @xmath70 and 2 .",
    "equation  ( [ etransport_dp ] ) has been numerically validated by @xcite .",
    "however , note that for @xmath71 , it deviates from the earlier common expression given by @xcite : @xmath72 , where @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is a normalized eddy turnover timescale .",
    "we have run a comparison simulation of the evolving dust distribution within the fiducial disc model using this other dust - diffusivity parameterization ( with commonly used @xmath75 ) and have found that the results are qualitatively identical to those using the parameterization in equation  ( [ etransport_dp ] ) .",
    "as discussed in  [ consequences ] , headwind - drag generally confines grains to regions of the disc with @xmath76 .",
    "we assume that , at @xmath4 , the entire mass of disc solids is in small particles ( 0.2  @xmath77 m ) whose radial distribution matches that of the disc gas .",
    "since coagulation occurs rapidly for such small - size particles , to a first approximation we expect that the grain - size distribution will rapidly approach an equilibrium dictated by collision / fragmentation processes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in more detail , however , the outer regions of a disc will experience a time - delay in the production of large grains relative to the inner , denser regions .",
    "this should translate into a delay before which rapid inspiral of large grains can occur from the outer disc .",
    "the grain trajectories calculated in our simulations are non - coagulative , considering a single grain - size for the full lifetime of a given run . in order to account for the delay in the appearance of larger grain sizes , we employ a pair of simplified grain - growth models ( described in appendix  [ ax_graingrowth ] ) to define a radially dependent timescale for the appearance of larger grains .",
    "larger grains are then initialized at time @xmath78 within ten radial zones for which grain - growth time scales ( at characteristic radii ) have been calculated .",
    "this initialization of all grains larger than 0.2  @xmath77 m diameter occurs only once per zone , explicitly neglecting the collisional or coagulative regeneration and resupply of any grain - size population that may be removed due to transport effects .",
    "however , as discussed in  [ results ] , limiting the appearance of large grains ( especially in the inner disc where they would be most likely to regenerate ) has the primary effect of retaining that dust mass against loss inward onto the parent star .",
    "this simplification therefore results in the highest dust - to - gas ratio in the inner disc achievable with our disc - evolution and dust - transport models .",
    "our simplified grain - growth models consider coagulation via differential settling ( in the rapid - upper - limit case in the absence of turbulence ) and random motions .",
    "we do not consider growth via differential - radial drift , which , e.g. , @xcite , found to produce more rapid growth time - scales , nor directly via turbulent velocity dispersions .",

    "plots the grain - growth timing employed within our fiducial disc simulations .",
    "we run our two cartoon grain - growth models independently and initiate larger grain sizes according the most rapid growth timescale indicated . due to disc evolution and depletion , sometimes only one ( or neither ) model will produce grains of a given size within a given zone .",
    "our ten zones have characteristic radii spaced logarithmically from 0.5 to 1000  au , and zone boundaries placed logarithmically between .",

    "@xmath85 @xmath86 for @xmath87 indicates that the local disc metallicity is unchanged from its initial ( solar ) value , whereas @xmath88 indicates an enhancement in the local dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "our simulations do not explicitly track refractory and icy material separately or include evaporation / condensation effects for grains crossing the snow - line .",
    "instead , the composition ( and therefore relative mass of grains ) is assumed to be that appropriate for the local disc - temperature conditions .",
    "while the enhancement factor is , therefore , the fundamental output of our dust - transport simulations , it can be translated into a local value for the dust - grain surface density , @xmath89 , separate from the disc gas . to do this ,",
    "we solve for @xmath89 at a given binned @xmath90 using those assumed compositions and the more general definition of the enhancement factor , @xmath91 where @xmath92 refers to the initial ( solar ) dust - gas composition of the disc , the baseline metallicity .",
    "@xmath93 used in this work is taken from @xcite and is broken into two components : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the total fraction of condensable material thought to be present in a solar - composition gas , and @xmath96 is the fraction of that material believed to actually be condensed based on the local gas temperature .",
    "the values of @xmath97 used are @xmath98 with transitions corresponding to the condensation of water ice ( the snow line ) and to the condensation of methane ( and ammonia ) ice .    because initially all disc solids are contained within 0.2  @xmath77 m grains , at @xmath4 all 0.2  @xmath77 m grains",
    "are assigned @xmath99 .",
    "when a new grain size , @xmath100 , is initialized within a radial zone , all @xmath81 values for grains 0.2  @xmath77 m  @xmath100 presently within that zone are reassigned to follow an updated mass allocation for the grain - size distribution . for this mass re - allocation , we assume a power - law distribution of grain sizes , @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the number density of grains of a given radius @xmath63 , and @xmath103 is the power - law index of the distribution . for the fiducial simulations , we take @xmath104 , corresponding to the size distribution of grains measured for the ism @xcite . however , observations linked to grain - growth within discs often predict flatter values of @xmath103 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and in  [ results ] we also report results that include @xmath105 and -4 , the later commonly used to depict a purely collisional size distribution , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "to calculate the fraction of the total dust mass within a zone to be reallocated into a given grain - size bin , we follow @xcite , where , for a general value of @xmath103 , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the local volume density of all solids , @xmath108 is the volume density of solids within size bin @xmath63 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the lower and upper bounds , respectively , on the entire size distribution , and @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the bounds on a given size bin . for @xmath113 , @xmath114 }             { \\left[\\ln \\left(s_\\mathrm{max}\\right)-\\ln \\left(s_\\mathrm{min}\\right)\\right ] }   \\ , .",

    "once we know the fraction of gas - equivalent mass to be portioned into each size bin , we divide it evenly among the particles of that size currently within the zone being updated .",
    "note that because our dust - transport trajectories are non - coagulative , tracking only a single grain size per model run , grain growth in our simulations in each radial zone occurs only when our grain - growth models indicate that the next largest grain size should be initiated . at that time , all of the dust mass currently within that zone is summed and redistributed according to equations  ( [ lpc_massfraction ] ) or ( [ lpc_massfraction4 ] ) , thereby updating the @xmath81 values of all particles ( including those newly initiated ) currently within that zone .",
    "we therefore maintain a roughly equilibriated grain - size distribution within our disc during the early period of growth up to large - grain sizes .",
    "however , as radial drift proceeds and preferentially depletes mass from the larger grain - size bins , this equilibration is not maintained .",
    "furthermore , we assume that larger grains will be built from grains only slightly smaller than themselves .",
    "therefore , in terms of mass reallocation , we do not initiate new , larger grains in a zone if radial drift has removed all grains of the next smallest size from that zone .    without a mechanism to replenish the large - dust population ,",
    "our simulations therefore produce a conservative estimate of the degree of dust - mass infall experienced within an evolving disk . as ( discussed in  [ results ] )",
    "grain growth and the infall of large grains primarily leads to the draining of dust - mass from the disc , we expect that our simulations represent rough upper - limits on local dust - to - gas enhancements in the inner / main disc at times greater than the earliest disc - evolution timescales ( @xmath117  myr . ) for possible alternatives at earlier times , see  [ results_varymodel ] .",
    "finally , we report the results for our dust - distribution simulations as a map of dust - to - gas enhancement , @xmath82 , within radial and temporal space , @xmath118 .",
    "while our simulations report mass values for each radial grid - point ( 600 total ) of our model disc and at each output time - step , usually @xmath119  years , we present our results at lower @xmath118 resolution in order to reduce noise from our particle - ensemble representation of the dust distribution .",
    "we present results using mass radially summed across three grid cells for 200 radial grid - points of results output , and averaged across usually 250 time - steps for a results @xmath120  years .",
    "we begin by considering several timescales relevant to grain transport , which are plotted in figure  [ fconsequences_comparetimescales ]    years of the fiducial disc model .",
    "timescales for grain - growth are from @xmath4 and include disc evolution .",
    "there is a break in the plotted advection timescale where the dust flow is radially outward .",
    "the dashed line references the disc lifetime . ]    for 0.2  mm grains at early times within the fiducial disc model .",
    "the first is the time - scale to grow grains to a given size , for which we plot the initiation timing taken from the models shown in figure  [ ftransport_fgraingrowth ] .",
    "next is the time - scale for grains to spiral inward onto the parent star .",
    "this can be approximated as the distance to the star divided by the local inward - drift / drag velocity . however , there are actually two inward velocities to consider .",
    "the first is the head - wind drag velocity by itself , which is commonly used in such loss estimates applied to static disc models .",
    "the second is the drag - advection velocity on the grain , calculated as @xmath53 from equations  ( [ etransport_svrda ] ) & ( [ etransport_svrdb ] ) above , which includes the ( mostly ) inward gas flow resultant from disc evolution . within our model ,",
    "the drift - only velocity , @xmath121 , may be calculated with the same method as @xmath53 only setting @xmath122 .",
    "the two inward - loss timescales are therefore defined as @xmath123 the final timescale to consider is the timescale for turbulent / diffusive redistribution of the particle ensemble , which for figure  [ fconsequences_comparetimescales ] we define as @xmath124    from the timescales plotted in figure  [ fconsequences_comparetimescales ] , one sees that there are several important trends to consider .    1 .",
    "the shortest time - scale is that for the appearance of these 0.2  mm grains within the disc , out to at least a few tens of au . at any one radius ,",
    "then , it would be reasonable to assume that the initial phases of grain growth are effectively instantaneous .",
    "however , when we consider the disc as a whole , we find that even our lower limit on the growth time scale in the outer disc _ exceeds _ other time scales in the inner disc .",
    "this implies that by the time sub - mm grains have formed at tens of au , we expect the major fraction of similar grains to have been lost from the inner few au .",
    "2 .   there is a large difference between the time - scales @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the inward drift time scale , which would represent the flow of particles in an inviscid disc , is relatively long and almost constant with @xmath10 .",
    "these features are consistent with the idea that radial drift results in a pile - up of solids in the inner disc . in an evolving disc , however , the advection time scale is substantially shorter everywhere inside 10  au .",
    "solids can therefore be lost via advection along with the gas , without having had time to pile - up .",
    "3 .   finally , the advection and diffusion timescales are similar , except in the outer disc where headwind - drag infall dominates .",
    "turbulent redistribution of grains can therefore matter in the inner disc .",
    "since turbulence represents a diffusive process , it will act to limit sharp radial gradients in particle concentration .    for planetesimal formation ,",
    "two basic properties of the background disc model are particularly important : the solid - gas coupling strength for particles of a given size , and the magnitude of the deviation from keplerian rotation due to gas pressure gradients .",
    "these quantities enter into models for planetesimal formation via either streaming instabilities , or vertical precipitation followed by collapse .",
    "it is therefore useful to discuss how they vary in the gas disc model that we assume .",
    "local dust - gas coupling is parameterized using the local gas - drag stopping time on particles within the disc .",
    "this depends on the size of the particle considered , but for characterizing the disc , we can plot the local particle - size corresponding to @xmath127 , which is a stopping time of particular interest to some theories of planetesimal formation . in the epstein - drag regime @xmath128 where @xmath63 and @xmath129 are the dust - grain radius and internal density , @xmath60 is the local gas density , and @xmath61 is the thermal velocity of the gas particles . at the midplane in a vertically - isothermal disc model , equation  ( [ econsequences_taus ] )",

    "enhancement values of the distribution are scaled to the total simulated dust - grain distribution , of which 0.2  mm grains make up some fraction . note that @xmath132 contours follow @xmath8 contours in a vertically isothermal disc ( eq .  [ econsequences_tausisothermal ] ) . ]",

    "recall , however , that a common minimum requirement quoted to aid planetesimal formation is a doubling of the dust - to - gas ratio above solar metallicity , and that , as discussed in  [ introduction ] , it is the first few million years of disc evolution that are of greatest interest in terms of bulk planetesimal formation .",

    "our fiducial disc has just over 100 earth - masses of solid material spread throughout the entire disc , with the greatest concentration just beyond the snow line at around 510 au .",
    "as the disc evolves , the solids distribution spreads outward with the disc and decreases in total quantity , to 40 @xmath151 at @xmath152 years , and 10 @xmath151 at @xmath153 myr .      to quantify the role of radial dependence on dust / gas enhancement results through both the local maximum of grain sizes considered and the time delay in the formation of the largest grains , we present two simulations using alternative grain - growth model assumptions . in the first , the initial particle - size distribution does _ not _ vary as a function of disc radius .",
    "all particles of all sizes ( 0.2 @xmath77 m  2 cm ) are instead initiated at @xmath4 evenly distributed throughout the entire disc - gas - mass distribution .",
    "this is similar to the radially independent size distribution used as an initial condition in the @xcite calculations of dust pile - up via radial drift , except that we retain the simple power - law form of the size distribution with @xmath104 throughout , while @xcite considered a two - component distribution representing chondrules and matrix material .",
    "the results of our simulations using a radially independent grain - size distribution are plotted in figure  [ fresults_tzeromap ]        and are distinct from those of our fiducial simulations . due to the large fraction of total dust mass",
    "now residing in large grain sizes , most of the dust - mass in the disc rapidly falls inward to small au .",
    "it is thus quickly lost onto the parent star , but not before creating a period of distinct enhancement in the dust - to - gas ratio in the inner disc .",
    "the peak in this enhancement occurs at @xmath154  years at about @xmath155 solar ( initial ) metallicity .",
    "( if we instead assume a maximum grain size of only 2  mm , the peak in the enhancement occurs at @xmath156  years . ) after this peak , disc metallicity declines swiftly , and by @xmath157 years the metallicity across the whole disc is at a fraction its @xmath4 value .",

    "it is thus hard to envisage a disc formation scenario in which the pile - up seen in this instant - grain - growth - everywhere simulation could be physically realized .",
    "moreover , such a short window supplied by this simulation for planetesimal formation is in direct contradiction with meteoritical evidence implying large - body formation in the solar system persisted for millions of years .    in the second alternative simulation",
    ", we again assume that grain growth is instantaneous , initiating all particles at @xmath4 . however , we now return to the assumption that the largest grains will grow only in the inner , dense regions of the disc .",

    ", 9.6  au is the outer boundary of the radial zone with characteristic radius defined at 6.3  au . ]",
    "this simulation produces results similar to those of our fiducial simulations but with two notable exceptions .",
    "first , the small - grain population is depleted relative to the fiducial simulations , producing a somewhat greater depletion of dust relative to the gas at large distances and at late times . in the fiducial simulations , small grains have time to advect and diffuse into the massive outer disc before dust mass at smaller distances",
    "is converted into larger sized grains .",
    "second , there is a peak in the enhancement factor of just over @xmath148 solar metallicity at small radii around @xmath160  years .",
    "this peak corresponds to the terminal infall of the 0.2  mm sized grains , which are carrying a larger portion of the dust mass than in the fiducial simulations .",
    "assuming instantaneous grain growth also allows infall of these larger grains without delay from the further regions of the disc ( out to @xmath161  au ) .",
    "while the 2  mm and 2  cm grain - size bins are also holding more dust mass than in the fiducial simulation and infall more swiftly than the 0.2  mm grains , their presence is too radially confined to produce an earlier peak in the dust / gas enhancement like that seen in figure  [ fresults_tzeromap ] .",
    "the enhancement peak produced in this simulation is timed more favorably to assist in planetesimal formation than the fully radially independent simulation , particularly under the potentially lower enhancement requirements of streaming - instability  type planetesimal formation .",
    "however , its duration is still noticeably shorter than the meteoritical evidence would seem to indicate necessary .",
    "the results of these simulations therefore seem to indicate that faster grain growth leads to a greater probability of dust pile - up in the inner regions of the disc , but that this effect is limited by the mass supplied in large grains initially a large distances from the star .",
    "furthermore , faster growth may still be insufficient to supply an extended period of dust / gas enhancement .",
    "for the remainder of our simulations , we return to initiating particles radially and temporally based on our cartoon models of grain growth .",
    "figure  [ fresults_diffusivity ]     and 2 .",
    "we use the fluid - dynamics convention that @xmath162 , while retaining the local scaling for particle diffusivity based on grain size using equation ( [ etransport_dp ] ) .",

    "plots the enhancement distributions produced varying the schmidt number , @xmath164 ( inversely varying the gas - disc scaling for the particle diffusivity ) , by a factor of two in either direction .",
    "we find the precise value of @xmath165 used to be unimportant to our results .",
    "a lower diffusivity leads to greater segregation of the particle - size distribution and emphasizes the discrete particle sizes used for these simulations .",
    "however , a real disc should have a mostly continuous particle - size distribution , and therefore the results for the global distribution of solids can not be said to be qualitatively different from the fiducial model .",
    "the higher - diffusivity case allows large grains to remain in the disc slightly longer than usual ( all 20 @xmath77 m grains are lost after 4.1 myr rather than by 3.8 myr as in the fiducial simulations ) , but again , this is insufficient to substantially alter the global distribution of solids .    in figure  [ fresults_varydiscs ] ,        we plot the composite enhancement maps for simulations run varying three disc - model parameters : the initial disc mass , @xmath9 ; the initial disc compactness , @xmath166 , and the magnitude of the disc viscosity , @xmath167 .",
    "qualitatively , the patterns of evolving global enhancement are roughly constant across the different disc - model setups .",
    "the infall of the smaller grain sizes causes depletion in the dust relative to the gas at the outer edge of the disc , while in the main disc enhancement values remain near unity for somewhere between 40 and 60% of the total disc lifetime .",
    "the initially more compact disc shows somewhat greater outer - disc depletion because a larger fraction of grains are processed to larger sizes at early times , while the disc using @xmath168 shows some of the enhanced segregation of our discrete particle sizes typical of the lower - diffusivity simulation in figure  [ fresults_diffusivity ] ( as , in our transport model , lower @xmath167 means lower disc viscosity _ and _ diffusivity ) .",
    "however , the basic shape of dust - to - gas values within the disc as controlled by aerodynamic forces appears fairly universal .",
    "the primary result , of these simulations then , is that a smoothly - defined , azimuthally - symmetric , evolving disc model tends to lose dust - mass smoothly inward onto the parent star at a rate that generally keeps pace with the loss of accreting disc - gas mass , and that variety in basic disc properties / parameters does not tend to produce special - case discs with respect to this process .",
    "in this section , we compare our simulated enhancement factors to those required by the @xcite precipitation model of planetesimal formation . in the precipitation model ,",
    "planetesimal formation is accomplished by the gravitational collapse of solids settled out to the disc midplane . as outlined in @xcite",
    ", it assumes that the disc is quiescent , with no global turbulence to stir the particles upward , and that grains will settle out to the limit provided by the kelvin - helmholz shearing instability . for midplane dust densities in this settled state above a certain mass threshold , the gravity of the dust sub - disc should dominate and lead to the collapse of solids at the midplane .",
    "the criteria for this collapse , given in @xcite equation  ( 15 ) , is @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the critical surface density of the solids for collapse , @xmath171 is the critical richardson number defining the degree of dust settling prior to the onset of the kelvin - helmholtz instability , and @xmath172 is a correction factor accounting for the self - gravity of the gas . @xcite define @xmath173 and @xmath174 -     \\sqrt{1 + 2\\psi } \\ , ; \\nonumber \\\\",

    "one expects that any degree of turbulence beyond the kelvin - helmholz effect should stir the particle distribution to greater vertical heights than those assumed in this @xmath171 scenario ; certainly , the @xmath179 used in our fiducial disc - evolution models suggests that a significant fraction of the small dust grains should be vertically well - mixed with the gas .",
    "however , assuming that grains could settle out to their kelvin - helmholtz limit allows us to calculate the absolute minimum enhancement - factor required for precipitation of planetesimals to proceed in that assumed non - turbulent environment .",
