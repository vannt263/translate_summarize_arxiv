    "recently the escape of classical particles from a vase - shaped cavity was studied by hansen , mitchell and delos@xcite .",
    "they demonstrated how the fractal structure can significantly affects the escape .",
    "the system is simple but it emulates other more complex systems such as the ionization of hydrogen in parallel electric and magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "a negative ion irradiated by a laser provides a coherent source of electron at the position of the negation ion@xcite .",
    "when the negative ion is placed inside an open cavity , the quantum electron will eventually escape from the cavity . in this paper , we study the photodetachment process of h@xmath4 inside a wedge and the subsequent escape of the quantum electrons . in particular , we are interesting in calculating _ total escape rates_. using a procedure similar to the previous case@xcite , it is straightforward to show that the total escape rates in the present case are equivalent to the total photodetachment cross sections in the wedge .",
    "henceforth , we will speak of cross sections instead of total escape rates .",
    "closely related to the present problem , we note yang _",
    "@xcite recently studied the photodetachment of h@xmath4 near a reflecting surface .",
    "subsequently afaq _ et al _ @xcite developed a theoretical imaging method and applied it to study the same system .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the formulas for the photodetachment cross sections inside a wedge .",
    "the formulas are valid for any linear laser polarization relative to the wedge with an opening angle of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an arbitrary positive integer . in sec.iii , as an example , we calculate and analyze the photo - detachment cross sections inside a wedge with an opening angle of @xmath3 .",
    "the dependence of the cross sections on the laser polarization is studied in detail .",
    "conclusions and perspective are given in sec.iv .",
    "in fig.1 we show a cross - sectional plane of the system . the negative ion is assumed to be at the origin .",
    "@xmath5 is the opening angle of the wedge .",
    "@xmath6 is the distance between the wedge axis and the negative ion , and @xmath7 is the declination angle relative to the left surface of the wedge .",
    "it is convenient to choose the coordinate system such that the @xmath8-axis is parallel to the wedge axis .",
    "the @xmath9-axis is perpendicular to left surface and the @xmath10-axis is parallel to the left surface .",
    "the @xmath11 plane is on the cross - sectional plane .",
    "according to the physical picture of closed - orbit theory ( cot)@xcite , when the active electron is detached by a laser , the active electron and the associated wave propagates out from the negative ion in all directions .",
    "the electron trajectories and wave fronts follow straight lines inside the wedge until they are reflected by the surfaces of the wedge .",
    "the electron may return to the region of the negative ion after several reflections .",
    "if so , the returning electron wave will interfere with the initial outgoing electron wave and induce oscillations in the total photodetachment cross sections .",
    "closed - orbit theory relates the cross sections to all the closed - orbits of detached - electron and provides a recipe to calculate the cross sections based on the closed - orbits and their associated properties .",
    "because the trajectories are reflected by the surfaces of the wedge , it is clear that all the closed - orbits which go out from the position of the negative ion and later return to the position of negative ion must be on the @xmath11 plane . to find closed - orbits in a wedge with an arbitrary opening angle",
    ", we can launch a large number of trajectories going out from the origin on the @xmath11 plane and keep track of the trajectories as they propagate and get reflected inside the wedge .",
    "if a group of nearby trajectories comes back to the region of the negative ion , the search can be refined to find the closed - orbit .",
    "this procedure has been previously used to find the closed - orbits for an atom in a magnetic field@xcite . in fig.1",
    "we show a group of trajectories near a closed - orbit ( solid line ) returning to the region of the negative ion .    according to cot@xcite",
    ", the total photodetachment cross section can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the photodetachment cross section of h@xmath4 without the wedge , @xmath14 is related to the normalization of the initial bound state @xmath15 of @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the speed of light and its value is approximately 137 a.u .. @xmath18 represents the oscillating part of the cross section associated with various detached - electron closed - orbits which will be detailed below .",
    "closed - orbit theory gives @xmath19 where @xmath15 is the initial bound state wave function of @xmath16 and is given by @xmath20 in the present one active electron approximation for photodetachment , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the binding energy and it is approximately @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a dipole operator which will be specified below .",
    "we will treat the general linear polarization case .",
    "if @xmath25 is the direction of the laser polarization and @xmath26 is the spherical coordinate of the detached - electron , the dipole operator can be written as @xmath27 .",
    "if we use @xmath28 to denote the spherical angles of the laser polarization direction , then @xmath29 and@xcite @xmath30    the returning wave @xmath31 near the negative ion in eq.(2 ) is represented as a sum over closed - orbits and is related to the initial outgoing detached - electron wave @xmath32 as @xmath33 where the sum runs over all the electron closed - orbits going out from and returning to the nucleus , @xmath34,@xmath35 and @xmath36 are , respectively , the action , amplitude and maslov index of the closed - orbit @xmath37 ; @xmath38 is the initial outgoing electron wave from the negative ion@xcite , where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the energy of electron after detachment .    to calculate the returning wave function associated with the closed orbits ,",
    "we draw a sphere of radius @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath41 is large enough so that the asymptotic approximation @xmath42 is valid .",
    "the sphere must also be small enough so that the distance between the surface of the sphere and surfaces of the wedge is large .",
    "the direct outgoing wave for the detached - electron on the surface of the sphere is then @xmath43 as the wave in eq.(5 ) propagates out from the sphere along a closed - orbit as illustrated in fig.1 , its amplitude and phase vary .",
    "we use @xmath44 to count for these variations in the wave function when it comes back via closed - orbit @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath45 is a measure of the divergence of adjacent trajectories from the closed - orbit @xmath37 .",
    "the expression in spherical coordinate is most convenient to calculate the amplitude @xmath35 in the present case .",
    "a simple manipulation gives @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the length of the @xmath37th trajectory , and @xmath48 is the classical action along the @xmath37th closed - orbit which is defined @xmath49 for the present system , we have @xmath50 .    in additional to the accumulated phase change of detached - electron wave which is expressed in the action , there is also a sudden phase change in the wave function accompanying each reflection by the surfaces of the wedge .",
    "we denote the phase loss of the wave function accompanying each reflection by @xmath51 . in our numerical calculations throughout this article , we set @xmath51 to @xmath52 corresponding to the `` hard '' wedge wall case@xcite",
    ". if the number of reflections of @xmath37th closed - orbit is @xmath53 , then @xmath54 in the `` hard '' wall case and the @xmath37th returning wave inside the small sphere is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the momentum of the returning electron near the atom and @xmath57 are the spherical coordinates defining the outgoing direction of the @xmath37th closed - orbit .",
    "the returning wave function inside the sphere can be approximated by a plane wave which can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 can be obtained from eq.(8 ) and eq.(9 ) as @xmath60    with the help of the integral in appendix a , we immediately get the result for the following overlap integral @xmath61    therefore the total photodetachment cross section can be written compactly for linear polarization in the direction of @xmath25 as @xmath62 where the summation is over all closed - orbits going out from and returning to the position of the negative ion .",
    "if we use @xmath63 to denote the spherical angles of the returning momentum vector @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 . the total photodetachment cross section in a wedge",
    "can be written alternatively as @xmath66 where the same summation over all the closed - orbits is implied .",
    "while numerical search may be necessary to find all the closed - orbits for a wedge with an arbitrary opening angle , the problem of finding all the closed - orbits is simplified for a wedge with an opening angle @xmath67 , where @xmath1 is an arbitrary positive integer . indeed , for a wedge with an opening angle @xmath67 , we find there are @xmath2 closed - orbits and these closed - orbits",
    "can be found by using a method of images as demonstrated in a recent study on spontaneous emission rate of an atom in a metallic wedge@xcite .",
    "here we give only a brief summary of the results .    for a wedge with an opening angle of @xmath0 , there are @xmath2 closed - orbits .",
    "all the closed - orbits have polar angles @xmath68 .",
    "their outgoing azimuthal angles are given by @xmath69 the corresponding azimuthal angles of the returning momentum @xmath56 are given by @xmath70    the lengths of the closed - orbits are @xmath71 the reflection numbers are @xmath72    when the above properties of the closed - orbits are used in eq.(13 ) , the total cross section for the @xmath9-polarization can be worked as @xmath73\\\\       & ~&+\\sum_{n=1}^{n-1}\\frac{3\\sigma_{0}\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi}{n}+\\beta)\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi}{n}-\\beta)}{2k\\rho\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{n } ) }      \\sin[2k\\rho\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{n})].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the total cross section for the @xmath10-polarization is @xmath74\\\\      & ~&-\\sum_{n=1}^{n-1}\\frac{3\\sigma_{0}\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{n}+\\beta)\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{n}-\\beta)}{2k\\rho\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{n } ) }       \\sin[2k\\rho\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi}{n})].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the oscillatory contributions from the closed - orbits vanishes for the @xmath8-polarization .",
    "therefore the total cross section for the @xmath8-polarization is the same as the cross section without the wedge , @xmath75    because there are @xmath2 closed - orbits in a wedge with an opening angle of @xmath0 , there are usually @xmath76 oscillatory terms in the cross sections . in the above formulas we observe @xmath2 oscillations in the total cross section for the @xmath9-polarization case . for the @xmath10-polarization , the contribution from the closed - orbit perpendicular to the @xmath10-axis vanishes and there are @xmath76 oscillations in the cross section . for the @xmath8-polarization , all the @xmath2 closed - orbits are perpendicular to the laser polarization ,",
    "all the @xmath2 oscillatory terms vanish and consequently there is no oscillation .",
    "as an example , we now discuss the photodetachment cross sections inside a wedge with an opening angle @xmath3 .",
    "we arbitrarily set @xmath77 for the purposes of numerical calculations .",
    "for this wedge , there are nine closed - orbits leaving from and returning to the position of the negative ion .",
    "all the closed - orbits are shown in fig.2 .",
    "they are labeled by @xmath37 in the ascending order of outgoing azimuthal angle @xmath78 . because all the closed - orbits must be on the cross - sectional plane",
    ", we have @xmath79 .",
    "the first closed - orbit leaves the atom in a direction with an azimuthal angle of @xmath80 relative to the @xmath9-axis , and it returns to the atom after being reflected perpendicularly by the right wedge surface ; the second closed - orbit leaves the atom in a direction with a larger azimuthal angle than the first closed - orbit , it is first reflected by the right wedge surface and then by the left wedge surface before it returns to the atom ; the third closed - orbit is first reflected by the right wedge surface , it then travels perpendicularly to the left wedge surface and retraces back to the atom .",
    "similar descriptions can be given to the other closed - orbits .",
    "we also find closed - orbit two ( four ) and eight ( six ) have the same path but their propagation directions are opposite .",
    "for each of the nine closed - orbits , we have evaluated the outgoing azimuthal angle @xmath78 , the azimuthal angle of the returning momentum @xmath81 , the reflection number @xmath53 and the length @xmath82 .",
    "the properties are summarized in table i.    [ i ]    .properties of the closed - orbits inside the wedge @xmath83 with @xmath77 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig.3 we show the total photodetachment cross sections for the @xmath9-polarization and for the @xmath10-polarization as a function of photon energy @xmath84 ( solid lines ) for the wedge @xmath83 with the negative ion fixed by @xmath77 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the bohr radius .",
    "compared to the smooth cross sections ( dashed lines ) in the absence of the wedge , the photodetachment cross sections inside the wedge are quite oscillatory . furthermore , even the closed - orbits are the same in both the @xmath9-polarization and @xmath10-polarization cases , we observe that the oscillation patterns in the cross sections are very different .",
    "for example , in fig.3(a ) for the @xmath9-polarization case , the oscillation pattern appears to be dominated by low frequency oscillations while in fig.3(b ) the oscillation pattern in the @xmath10-polarization case appears to be dominated by higher frequency oscillations .",
    "this suggests a strong dependence of the photodetachment cross section on the laser polarization direction . to explain these features , we display in fig.4 the oscillatory part of the cross sections and the contribution from each closed - orbit in both polarization cases . from fig.4(a )",
    "it is clear that in the @xmath9-polarization case the shorter closed - orbits such as 1,2,7,8,9 make larger contributions and the longer closed - orbits such as 3,4,5,6 make smaller contributions .",
    "shorter closed - orbits are associated with low frequency oscillations and longer closed - orbits are associated with higher frequency oscillations . when these contributions are added together ,",
    "the overall oscillation pattern appears to be dominated by low frequency oscillations for @xmath9-polarization as in fig.3(a ) . in fig.4(b ) for the @xmath10-polarization we observe that all the closed - orbits except 9 are equally important .",
    "this leads to a more oscillatory pattern in the cross section in fig.3(b ) .",
    "now we consider the dependence of the photodetachment cross section on the negative ion position . in figs .",
    "5(a ) and 5(c ) we fixed the angle @xmath77 and calculated the cross sections as functions of the radial distance of the negative ion from the wedge axis in both the @xmath9-polarization and @xmath10-polarization cases . in both cases ,",
    "we observe the cross sections display oscillations with damping oscillation amplitudes as @xmath6 becomes larger . in fig.5(b ) and fig.5(d ) we fixed @xmath85 and show the cross sections as the angle @xmath7 is varied in both the @xmath9-polarization and @xmath10-polarization cases .",
    "it is noted that for the @xmath9 polarization , the oscillation amplitude is enhanced when the negative ion approaches either the left wedge surface or the right wedge surface .",
    "but in the @xmath10-polarization case , the oscillation amplitude is enhanced when the negative ion moves close to the right wedge surface but is reduced when the negative ion is close to the left wedge surface .",
    "since the cross section is influenced strongly by the laser polarization , in fig.6 we show the oscillating part of the cross section as a function of the laser polarization direction .",
    "the photon energy was set to 1.0ev , the radial distance @xmath6 was set to @xmath87 and the angle @xmath7 was set to @xmath88 .",
    "we can conclude from this figure that the oscillating part or the quantum interference is largest when the polar angle of the laser polarization is on the cross - sectional plane on which all the closed - orbits live or @xmath89 .",
    "when the laser polarization direction is perpendicular to the cross - sectional plane , the oscillating part of the cross section vanishes .",
    "furthermore , one can conclude from fig.6 that the influence on the cross section is maximized when the azimuthal angle of the laser polarization is parallel to the @xmath9-axis .",
    "in summary , we have studied the photodetachment process of h@xmath4 inside a wedge and calculated the total escape rates of the electrons . in the present case ,",
    "the total escape rates are equal to the total photodetachment cross sections which have be calculated using cot",
    ". the cross section can be expressed as a sum of a smooth part and an oscillating part as in eq.(1 ) .",
    "the smooth part describes the direct escape of the electrons from the negative ion in the absence of the wedge , and the quantum interference effect of the wedge on the cross section is embodied in the oscillating part .",
    "the oscillation terms would disappear for the escape of classical particles .",
    "in particular , we find for a wedge with an opening angle @xmath0 , where n is an arbitrary positive integer , there are @xmath2 induced oscillations in the total escape rates .",
    "we have made the calculations by assuming the reflection by the wedge surfaces induces a phase loss of @xmath90 corresponding to a `` hard '' wall@xcite .",
    "similar calculations can be carried out by assuming the reflection induces a phase loss of @xmath91 corresponding to a `` soft '' wedge wall .",
    "the change in the value of @xmath51 will lead to some changes in the details of the escape rates but should not change the main conclusions .",
    "here we evaluate the overlap integral needed in eq.(11 ) , @xmath92 in eq.(a.3 ) the integral on the radial variable was given previously@xcite and the integral on the angular variables in eq.(a.3 ) can be carried out by choosing the @xmath8-axis in the direction of @xmath93 , @xmath94          \\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\theta)d\\theta d\\phi , \\\\ & = & \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\cos(\\theta_l ) , \\\\ & = & \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\hat{\\bf \\epsilon } \\cdot \\hat{\\bf k}^j_{ret}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    paul hansen1 , kevin a. mitchell and john b. delos , phys .",
