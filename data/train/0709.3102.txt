    "in the last decade or two we have made remarkable progress in measuring cosmological parameters to unprecedented accuracy .",
    "parameters such as the hubble constant , @xmath0 @xcite , the temperature of the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) , @xmath1 @xcite , and many other parameters are now known to impressive precision .",
    "of course , we do nt invest so much time and effort to determine cosmological parameters because of an interest in numerology , but rather , we do it because the parameters are necessary input for the task of constructing a standard cosmological model .    the precision cosmological measurements have lead to the latest cosmological model , usually called the _ standard cosmological model , _ or @xmath2cdm , where @xmath2 indicates einstein s cosmological constant ( or more generally , dark energy ) , and cdm stands for cold dark matter . aspects of this cosmological standard model relevant for the purposes of these lectures are indicated in figure [ pie ] .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the standard cosmological model is that it seems capable of accounting for all cosmological observations ; i.e. , it seems to work !",
    "there are several interesting features of the @xmath2cdm model illustrated in fig .",
    "first , while the early universe was radiation dominated , at present the radiation energy density is only @xmath3 of the total .",
    "the figure also illustrates why chemistry is not very important : the chemical elements ( by which i mean elements other than the simplest elements of hydrogen and helium ) are only about @xmath4 of the total .",
    "neutrinos contribute a much larger fraction of the total mass - energy density , about @xmath5 .",
    "the neutrino contribution is about as large as the contribution from stars .",
    "most of the baryons in the universe are not found in stars , but rather they are in the form of a hot intracluster gas of hydrogen and helium .",
    "this completes what we `` see '' ( although there is only indirect evidence for the cosmic neutrino background ) .",
    "the most striking feature of the present composition of the universe in the @xmath2cdm model is that @xmath6 of the present universe is dark ! of the dark components ,",
    "roughly @xmath7 of the total mass - energy density is dark matter , associated with galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and other bound structures .",
    "the bulk of the mass - energy of the universe , about @xmath8 in the standard @xmath2cdm model , is dark energy , which drives an accelerated expansion of the universe .    in the first lecture",
    "i will discuss issues associated with dark energy . in the second lecture",
    ", i will discuss possibilities for dark matter .",
    "also in the second lecture i will briefly discuss some aspects of cosmic inflation , in particular what we might learn about inflation from present observations .",
    "for the purposes of this school , let me begin by recalling einstein s comment to arnold sommerfeld on december 9 , 1915 , `` how helpful to us is astronomy s pedantic accuracy , which i used to secretly ridicule . ''",
    "while einstein was referring to precision measurements of the advance of the perihelion of mercury , now we find precision measurements helpful to us because dark energy , dark matter , inflation , and baryo / leptogenesis seem to point to physics beyond the standard model of particle physics .",
    "cdm cosmological model .",
    "illustrated by the pie is the fraction of the mass - energy of the universe in various components . also noted are some other necessary parts of the standard model , namely seed perturbations and baryo / leptogenesis.,width=415 ]",
    "the most important point regarding dark energy , which i will stress repeatedly , is that all evidence for dark energy is _ indirect . _",
    "the only effect of dark energy is on the expansion history of the universe .",
    "the expansion rate of the universe is perhaps the most fundamental quantity in cosmology . in the standard cosmological model the expansion rate",
    "is determined from the @xmath9-component of the einstein equations , @xmath10 . in the friedmann - robertson - walker - lematre ( flrw )",
    "model , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the expansion rate ( here , @xmath13 is the robertson - walker scale factor and @xmath14 or @xmath15 depending on the geometry ) . with the assumption of a perfect - fluid stress tensor , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mass density .",
    "the stress tensor is assumed to consist of several components with different equations of state . for any component @xmath18 ,",
    "the equation of state is defined as @xmath19 .",
    "the energy density in component @xmath18 evolves with redshift @xmath20 as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the present value of the scale factor . in the event that @xmath23 is a function of @xmath13 ,",
    "then @xmath24 should be replaced by @xmath25\\right\\}$ ]",
    ". then the expansion rate as a function of redshift can be expressed as @xmath26 .",
    "\\label{hsquared}\\ ] ] here , @xmath27 is the ratio of the present energy density in component @xmath18 compared to the critical density @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the subscript `` @xmath30 '' indicates a matter component ( @xmath31 ) while the subscript `` @xmath32 '' indicates a radiation component ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath34 is well determined by wmap to be @xmath35 at the @xmath36 confidence level @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath37 is also well determined by cbr measurements : it is of order @xmath38 .",
    "finally , @xmath39 is determined by measuring the expansion history of the universe , and determining the values of @xmath39 and @xmath23 necessary to fit the data .",
    "many cosmological observables depend on the expansion history of the universe .",
    "they often depend on the expansion history through the coordinate distance @xmath40 of a source of redshift @xmath41 . recall that the robertson - walker metric can be written in the form @xmath42 , \\label{rw}\\ ] ] where here @xmath43 is the angular differential and @xmath40 is the comoving `` radial '' coordinate .",
    "the radial coordinate of a source at redshift @xmath41 is determined by integrating the null geodesic ( @xmath44 ) to obtain @xmath45 , \\label{rofz}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 obtains for @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "now let us turn to the observables defined in table [ obs ] .",
    "one can see that they all depend on the time evolution of the expansion rate , hence to the properties of the stress tensor , hence to a new fluid characterized by @xmath23 .",
    ".[obs ] the relationship of observables to the time evolution of the expansion rate of the universe .",

    "the inflaton potential must be `` flat '' in the sense that its derivative must be unusually small .",
    "2 .   while it is always easy to write a potential that is flat , it must remain flat when one includes radiative corrections .",
    "this presumably suggests some ( possibly approximate ) symmetry .",
    "although it has often been said that susy can come to the rescue , in practice it is not so easy to implement @xcite .",

    "we need experimental guidance .    for phenomenological guidance , it is now traditional to present the observational results on @xmath56 and the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations on the same graph @xcite .",
    "the utility of this approach can be seen in fig .",
    "[ rn1 ] . to a first approximation ,",
    "small - field , large - field , and hybrid models populate different regions of the @xmath56@xmath40 plane .",
    "the experimental situation is shown in fig .",

    "zeldovich spectrum ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) is ruled out at approximately the @xmath65 confidence level .",
    "the result is little changed if one adds additional data sets .",
    "if one allows running of the scalar spectral index , then a slightly blue ( @xmath66 ) spectrum is preferred .",
    "my conclusion is that one can not make a strong statement about whether the harrison ",
    "zeldovich spectrum is ruled out or not .",
    "it is also premature to draw any conclusion regarding phenomenology of inflation models .",
    "now let us return to the possibility of producing non - thermal dark matter during inflation .",
    "particles of all types ( at least those that are not conformally coupled ) are produced during inflation .",
    "if there is a massive stable particle species , they will also be produced during inflation and be around today .",
    "two groups @xcite proposed this could be the source of dark matter .",
    "detailed calculations show that that if there is a stable particle with mass comparable to the inflaton mass , they would be produced in the proper abundance to be the dark matter .",
    "since the mass of the inflaton is expected to be @xmath67 or @xmath68 gev , the dark matter particle would be supermassive  much more massive than a wimp can be  hence , it is known as a wimpzilla .    unlike thermal relics , where the contribution to @xmath69 depends on the annihilation cross section and independent of the mass ,",
    "the wimpzilla contribution to @xmath69 is independent of the interactions and depends only on the mass"
