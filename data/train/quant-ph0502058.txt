    "coherent control of atomic and molecular dynamics using optical fields has attracted much attention , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . thus far , most theoretical work has focused on the idealized case of isolated systems , where loss of quantum phase information due to decoherence , i.e. coupling to the environment , is ignored .",
    "such effects are , however , crucial to control in realistic systems , since loss of phase information results in loss of control .",
    "for this reason efforts to understand control in external environments @xcite @xcite and to compensate for the resultant decoherence ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) are of great interest .    there exist a number of basic interference schemes@xcite that embody the essence of coherent control .",
    "one is the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 photon scenario where control results from interference between state excitation using @xmath0 and @xmath1 photons simultaneously . in this letter",
    "we provide an analytic solution for control in the two - level @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 photon control scenario in the presence of decoherence . for simplicity , we examine the 1 vs. 3 photon case , although the solutions obtained below apply equally well to the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 photon case , with obvious changes in the input rabi frequencies and relative laser phases .    in 1 vs. 3 photon control@xcite a continuous wave electromagnetic field composed of a superposition of a fundamental and third harmonic wave",
    "is incident on a system . by varying the relative phase and amplitude of the fundamental and",
    "the third harmonic one can alter the population of the state excited by the incident field .",
    "clearly , decoherence can be expected to diminish the 1 vs. 3 photon induced interference , and hence the control over excitation . although extensive theoretical @xcite - @xcite and experimental @xcite - @xcite studies have been carried out on the 1 vs. 3 photon coherent control scenario , there has been no serious examination of the stability of this control scheme in an external environment , barring a derivation of a simple analytical expression for the autoionization of a two - level atomic system for weak laser intensities , using the rate approximation @xcite . amongst the various possible influences of an environment on a system we focus on the loss of phase coherence , that is , dephasing .",
    "dephasing is expected to occur on a time scale more relevant to control , since the duration of control field can be on the order of a picosecond or less , wheras the typical time scale for energy transfer is considerably longer @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that the 1 vs. 3 photon phase control scenario ( which controls the population ) in a two - level system , when coupled to an environment , reduces to the analytically soluble monochromatic field case , but with an effective rabi frequency that is determined by the relative phase and amplitudes of the two fields .",
    "sample results for control as a function of relative laser phase in the presence of dephasing are then provided .",

    "[ control2lt ] ) in which there are many rabi cycles during the pulse , the control curve is not necessarily monotonic since the final excited populations are determined by the time at which the fields are turned off . introducing dephasing is seen to lead to a decreased range of control whose magnitude depends on the relative strength of the dephasing and on the effective rabi frequencies , according to eqs .",
