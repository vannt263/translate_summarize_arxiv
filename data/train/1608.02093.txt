    "the reason for such behavior is that photons are predominantly localized in the same cavity for two upper doublon bands , while for two lower doublon bands photons are mainly localized in the neighboring cavities .",
    "as it is pointed out in the previous section , energies of the two from four doublon bands depend almost linearly on @xmath7 . thus , in the limit of strong interaction @xmath154 these two bands are well separated from the remaining states ( see fig .",

    "in this section we discuss a general ansatz for @xmath15 that allows one to investigate analytically all types of two - photon excitations supported by a finite cavity array . due to the property @xmath13 ,",
