    "the study of the properties of nuclei far from the line of @xmath4 stability is currently one of the most active and challenging topics in nuclear structure .",
    "exotic ratios of z / n for a given mass number together with the presence of weakly bound nucleons lead to the phenomena which are unexpected from our common sense about stable nuclei ; among others , one finds the change of the shell structure and magic numbers . observed properties of low - lying states in @xmath5be@xmath6 and @xmath7be@xmath8 have contributed to the finding that n=8 is no longer a magic number in such unstable nuclei .    though there have been already many elaborate attempts to describe the structure of be isotopes ,",
    "in the present paper we give an interpretation of available spectroscopic data on @xmath2be and @xmath3be keeping a model as simple as possible , while taking duly into account the essential feature of these nuclei ; the presence of weakly - bound neutron(s ) in finite deformed potentials . a simplest version of bohr - mottelson model ( see chaps . 4 and 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is applied to the nuclei @xmath3be and @xmath2be , using weakly - bound one - particle wave - functions estimated properly with deformed woods - saxon potentials instead of harmonic - oscillator potentials .",
    "the present work is prompted by the recent lifetime measurements of the 0@xmath9 state in @xmath2be @xcite .",
    "the deformation of be isotopes has been studied using various theoretical models ; for example , @xmath3be is studied using models with deformed woods - saxon potentials @xcite , @xmath3be based on the nilsson - strutinsky method @xcite , and neutron - rich be isotopes using the deformed hartree - fock calculation with skyrme interactions @xcite .",
    "the models used in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which the idea of the particle - rotor model is used , may be closest to our present model .",
    "however , since in very light nuclei such as be isotopes the nuclear shape may be considerably changed just by adding one neutron , we would avoid to use the observed properties of the core nucleus @xmath10be , in contrast to the work of refs . @xcite .",
    "since only low - energy states are discussed in the present work , we assume that four protons and six neutrons are treated as being inactive occupying the lowest possible nilsson levels for the same deformation as that for the extra neutron(s ) .",
    "thus , the inactive core is certainly different from the actual @xmath10be nucleus .",
    "moreover , the rotational perturbation of the intrinsic nuclear structure is neglected since only those states close to the band head are studied in the present work .",
    "thus , we try to see how the observed properties of low - lying levels of @xmath3be and @xmath2be can be understood in terms of weakly - bound neutron(s ) in deformed potentials .",
    "deformed nuclear halos are studied in ref .",
    "@xcite using a finite square - well potential without spin - orbit term , while in ref .",
    "@xcite they are investigated with more realistic potentials : deformed woods - saxon potentials with a spin - orbit term .    in sec .",
    "ii some aspects of the model and formulas are summarized . in sec.iii numerical results",
    "are presented and discussed in comparison with experimental data , while in sec .",
    "iv conclusions are given .",
    "it is known @xcite that in medium - heavy deformed nuclei the analysis of low - energy spectroscopic properties in terms of one - particle motions in a deformed potential works impressively well , especially if the pair - correlation in the form of bcs quasiparticles is included .",
    "this is because the major part of the long - range two - body interaction is already taken into account in the deformed mean - field . in very light nuclei such as",
    "be isotopes the many - body pair correlation that originates from a short - range interaction can be negligible . therefore ,",
    "in the present work we try to describe the spectroscopic properties of low - lying states of @xmath3be and @xmath2be in terms of two nilsson levels occupied by the seventh neutron and the seventh and eighth neutrons , respectively , in deformed woods - saxon potentials .",
    "the pairing interaction between two weakly - bound neutrons in @xmath2be will be duly taken into account .",
    "this simple description may be justified , since there are no nearby nilsson levels in the region of deformation , where the [ 220,1/2 ] and [ 101,1/2 ] levels are almost degenerate .    one - particle levels with quantum numbers k@xmath11 in a @xmath12-deformed potential ( nilsson levels ) are denoted by the asymptotic quantum numbers , [ @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the asymptotic quantum numbers express , in a good approximation , the wave functions of one - particle levels well bound in sufficiently deformed potentials .",
    "when a one - particle level becomes weakly bound , the wave function can be very different from that indicated by the asymptotic quantum numbers , even when the one - particle potential is well deformed @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , just for convenience sake , in the present work we use the asymptotic quantum numbers to denote respective nilsson levels , also in the case that those levels become weakly bound .    in the leading order",
    "the rotational energy spectrum is written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 expresses the moment of inertia while the decoupling parameter is denoted by @xmath18 . the expression ( [ eq : erot ] ) , in which the rotational perturbation of the intrinsic structure is neglected , is expected to work well for low - lying rotational states close to the band head .",

    "the quadrupole matrix element connecting these two states in the intrinsic system is written as @xmath29 similarly , the monopole matrix element is @xmath30 the unique feature of these transition matrix - elements is illuminated on p.552 - 553 of ref .",

    "there are only two known bound states in @xmath3be : the 1/2@xmath36 ground state and the 1/2@xmath37 state at ex=0.32 mev . due to the very small neutron separation energy @xmath38=0.504 mev",
    ", there is no hope to observe enhanced e2 transitions to establish possible rotational spectra based on the ground state .",
    "however , at least three resonant levels , 5/2@xmath39 at ex = 1.78 mev , 3/2@xmath40 at ex = 2.69 mev and 3/2@xmath39 at ex = 3.41 mev , have been established by recent experiments @xcite .",
    "if we regard the two one - particle resonant levels , 5/2@xmath39 at ex = 1.78 mev and 3/2@xmath39 at ex = 3.41 mev , as members of the rotational band based on the ground state with @xmath41 = 1/2@xmath36 , we obtain the decoupling parameter @xmath18=1.82 and the rotational constant @xmath42=0.403 mev .",
    "then , using the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : erot ] ) , the member of the ground - state rotational band in @xmath3be next lowest to 3/2@xmath36 is the 9/2@xmath39 state , which is expected around ex=6.7 mev in the absence of rotational perturbation .",
    "the centrifugal barrier for the 9/2@xmath39 level is quite high and , thus , the possible resonance will be relatively sharp in spite of its higher energy .",
    "assuming that the moment of inertia @xmath17 is proportional to @xmath43 , @xmath42=0.349 mev is obtained for @xmath2be .",

    "the deformed woods - saxon potential is needed only to obtain the wave function of the seventh neutron , though the total neutron potential in the presence of a halo neutron may not be properly described by a woods - saxon potential . in table",

    "the calculated value is not sensitive either to the used @xmath55 value of the even - even core or the parameters of the woods - saxon potential .",

    "the neutron effective charge for e0 transitions , @xmath151 , may sensitively depend on both neutron excess and weak binding .",
    "the contribution to @xmath151 coming from the part of the one - body operator obtained by subtracting the center of mass motion is @xmath152 , which is equal to ( 0.028)e for @xmath2be",
    ". however , this may hardly give a reliable estimate of the actual @xmath151 value .",
    "if the charge radius of @xmath2be relative to that of either @xmath3be or @xmath10be is ever measured , it will help to obtain an estimate of the @xmath151 value to be used in the present case @xcite .",
    "since no such measurement is presently available , writing the measured value as @xmath153 we obtain @xmath154",
    "we have presented the interpretation of available spectroscopic data on @xmath2be and @xmath3be , using a model which is simple and contains the essential feature of the presence of weakly - bound neutron(s ) in deformed potentials .",
    "calculated results are in good agreement with available data .",
    "we have intentionally avoided to make a quantitative comparison of spectroscopic factors with `` measured '' ones , partly because the presently available factors obtained from the analysis of data may , in our opinion , contain an ambiguity in the one - particle radial wave - functions used and partly because the inactive core nucleus @xmath10be in our present model is different from the observed nucleus @xmath10be .",
    "the features of weakly - bound neutrons appear especially in : ( a ) strong e1 transitions in both @xmath3be and @xmath2be due to the increased and spatially - extended @xmath53 component in the [ 220,1/2 ] wave function ; ( b ) the large b(e2;@xmath155 ) value , due to both the larger value of @xmath156 | r^2 y_{20 } | [ 220,1/2 ] \\rangle$ ] and the negative value of @xmath129 | r^2 y_{20 } | [ 101,1/2 ] \\rangle$ ] ; ( c ) the large @xmath156 | r^2 | [ 220,1/2 ] \\rangle$ ] matrix element that contributes to the e0 transition , @xmath157 .    in medium - heavy mass region one",
    "hardly finds a deformed nucleus , in which an @xmath158=1/2@xmath39 level lies close to an @xmath158=1/2@xmath37 level around the ground state .",
    "therefore , the nucleus @xmath3be is the rare case , in which @xmath158=1/2@xmath36 and 1/2@xmath37 levels are almost degenerate and the importance of the presence of the signature - dependent term in b(e1 ) values is manifested .",
