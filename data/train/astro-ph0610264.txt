    "whether the first galaxies were formed from initial large - scale condensations , or grew from an assembly of smaller bodies , still remains one of the most fundamental questions in modern astrophysics .",
    "studies of the most massive galaxies will provide important constraints on this .",
    "similar considerations apply to supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) as the masses of smbhs correlate with properties of the host bulge @xcite , i.e. , the smbh mass _ vs. _ bulge luminosity ( @xmath5 ) relation @xcite , the smbh mass _ vs. _ stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath6 ) relation @xcite , and the smbh mass _ vs. _ sersic index relation @xcite .",
    "as highly luminous massive galaxies found toward the centers of galaxy clusters , brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) have received considerable interest .",
    "the surface brightness profiles ( sbps ) of bcgs are well fit by the same @xcite law that describes less - luminous spheroids @xcite , apart from the outer - most regions which sometimes exhibit faint , extended envelopes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b06 ) .",
    "bcgs also appear to obey the same relations between fitting parameters that characterize e / s0 galaxies generally @xcite .",
    "* hereafter l06 ) noted that the @xmath7 relation , in the v - band ( @xmath8 ) , predicts higher smbh masses in bcgs than are predicted by the @xmath9 relation .",
    "b06 obtain similar results ; the slope in the size - luminosity relation is found to be steeper in bcgs when compared to the bulk of e / s0 s , and the @xmath3 _ vs. _ luminosity ( @xmath10 ) relation is seen to flatten for the brightest galaxies .    while the low - scatter @xmath6 relation is the preferred `` secondary '' smbh mass estimation technique , compared to the larger - scatter @xmath8 relation , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mh03 ) have shown that the scatter in the relations become similar if parameters are derived in the near - infrared ( nir ) . with this in mind",
    "we have conducted a study of bcgs based on the 2mass extended source catalog .",
    "we use the 219 l06 galaxies of which @xmath11 are bcgs and the remainder are e / s0s .",
    "the l06 data include absolute v - band magnitudes ( @xmath12 ) and , except in 51 cases , a value for @xmath3 .",
    "we adopt the errors of 10% in @xmath12 and @xmath3 , as quoted by l06 .",
    "we supplement the @xmath12 data with the nir data contained within the 2mass extended source catalog .",
    "all magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction according to @xcite .",
    "distances are all adjusted to a common scale , with @xmath13 , and primarily taken from the survey of @xcite .",
    "remaining distances are taken from @xcite or from the virgo in - fall corrected recessional velocities listed by hyperleda @xcite . in   [ phot ]",
    "we evaluate the 2mass photometry . in   [ main ] we present the results , which are discussed in   [ dis ] .",
    "  [ con ] sums up .",
    "in this study we have used the 2mass `` total '' magnitudes ( e.g. , @xmath14 ) derived from sbp fitting extrapolation , rather than aperture photometry which inevitably under - estimates the total galaxy magnitudes @xcite .",
    "briefly , @xmath14 is estimated by numerical integration of the srsic law , fitted between @xmath15@xmath16 ( to avoid the point spread function ) and the maximum radius ( @xmath17 ) of the sbp with a signal to noise greater than two .",
    "assuming circular isophotes and @xmath18@xmath19 ( see figure  [ fig:2mass ] ) , this corresponds to a sbp limit from 2.9 to 3.7 magnitudes below the 2mass @xmath20 limit ( 20.09 , 19.34 and 18.55 in j , h and k ) .",
    "the best - fitting srsic law is then integrated up to @xmath21 ( the galaxy `` total '' radius ) .",
    "typically , @xmath21 is @xmath22@xmath23 times the radius of the 20 mag / arcsec@xmath24 isophote ( e.g. , @xmath25 ) where @xmath26 is imposed as a strict upper limit .    to quantify the importance of undetected light at large radii , we have carried out extensive simulations of bcgs and performed 2mass analogous photometry . over @xmath27 bcgs with @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath28 randomly distributed in the observed ranges ( -24.5  -22 and 0.015  0.050 , respectively ) were generated . for each bcg",
    "the effective radius was derived from the @xmath29 relation provided by l06 , and the srsic index , @xmath30 , was derived from the @xmath31 relation estimated from figure  11 of @xcite ( 0.2 dex scatter was included for both ) . in all cases we imposed @xmath32 .",
    "the observed total k magnitude , @xmath33 , was then derived using v - k=3.6 .",
    "the model images of each bcg ( characterized by @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath30 ) were then generated using galfit @xcite to take into account the 2mass pixel sizes ( 1 ) and spatial resolution ( fwhm @xmath36 ) .",
    "we added 2mass typical noise ( k = 19.74 mag / arcsec@xmath24 rms ) and derived sbps that were fitted with a srsic law to estimate @xmath21 and @xmath14 .",
    "to reproduce the magnitude - size relation ( see figure  [ fig:2mass ] ) we used an average @xmath21 of @xmath37 .",
    "figures  [ fig:2mass ] and [ fig:2mass2 ] show how the simulated magnitudes compare to the actual bcg magnitudes and the `` true '' simulated input magnitudes .",
    "the average offset is -0.5 mags ( 50@xmath38 percentile ) ; 2mass mildly underestimates @xmath33 in bcgs .",
    "simulations using bluer colors ( v - k=3.3 ) give very similar result .",
    "in   [ main ] we will directly compare the results from extrapolating photometry estimated in the v - band and nir .",
    "as the v - band photometry may have been gained from different radii ( thereby gathering a different amount of light ) we now briefly compare the relative sizes of the regions from which the photometry was derived .",
    "the l06 v - band bcg luminosities were provided by @xcite , who in turn estimated the total magnitudes from sbps presented by @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed srsic fits to these sbps using a limiting r - band surface brightness .",
    "therefore , assuming a color of r - k=3.0 , we can directly compare the radii of @xmath21 and @xmath39 ( the radius of the k=20 mag / arcsec@xmath24 isophote ) with the r - band surface brightness at 23.0 mag / arcsec@xmath24 ( @xmath40 ) . by calculating @xmath40 from the @xcite",
    "bcg srsic fits , we find that @xmath25 agrees well with the @xmath40 radii ( figure  [ fig : comprad ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath21 is always larger than @xmath40",
    ". therefore , the 2mass magnitudes used in this study include light _ from at least _ as extended a region as the v - band magnitudes used by l06 .    as an additional check ,",
    "we can compare published values of @xmath33 to those derived by mh03 from two - dimensional fitting to 2mass profiles out to infinity .",
    "we find a systematic offset of @xmath41 mags , consistent with our simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : lsig ] compares the @xmath42 and @xmath43 relations . in both cases",
    "we plot the best - fit relation defined by the e / s0 galaxies ( solid line ) as well as the @xmath10 fit given by b06 ( their figure  6 with colors of v - r=0.6 and r - k=3.0 ) .",
    "we find shallower slopes for the e / s0 population consistent with b06 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lsig](a ) demonstrates that the `` bending '' of the @xmath42 relation , as noted by b06 , is also seen in the l06 sample ; bcgs fall above the relation defined by the e / s0s . in the nir ( figure  [ fig : lsig]b )",
    "the bcgs do not appear to define a separate population ; instead their distribution is indistinguishable from that of the e / s0s .",
    "the average offset of bcgs from the e / s0 relation is 1.20 mags in @xmath12 and 0.48 mags in @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ fig : vvsnir ] presents the relationship between @xmath44 estimated from the v - band ( hereafter @xmath45 ) , using the relation as defined by l06 ( their equation  4 ) , and @xmath44 estimated from the nir data ( hereafter @xmath46 ) using the relations defined by the mh03 sample .",
    "the upper limit for @xmath45 is @xmath47 .",
    "below @xmath48 the agreement between all bands is good . above @xmath49 ,",
    "the nir data predict significantly lower smbh masses , with none exceeding @xmath50 .",
    "the fit to the k - band relation is shown as a dotted line and has a slope of @xmath51 ( @xmath52 for e / s0s ) . for estimates of @xmath46",
    "we do not use the exact fits presented by mh03 ( e.g. their table 2 ) as they were derived using a bisector method ( e.g. , assuming scatter in both @xmath44 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "instead , @xmath46 has been determined from a single y@xmath54x fit to @xmath44 and @xmath55 ( taking into account errors from both axis ) because in estimating @xmath44 from @xmath55 one assumes that all the scatter is in only one variable .",
    "the form of this relation , in the k - band , is given by @xmath56 .",
    "the results , in this case , are insignificant from the original mh03 fits ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : dirsigmag ] shows how photometric @xmath44 estimates compare to those from the @xmath6 relation .",
    "the @xcite expression is used to derive @xmath44 from @xmath3 , hereafter @xmath58 . in figure",
    "[ fig : dirsigmag](a ) the @xmath8 relation ( above @xmath49 ) predicts smbh masses greater than those expected from the @xmath6 relation .",
    "however , in the nir , this observation is not made ; both predictions are consistent .",
    "the @xmath59 relation implies @xmath60 , whereas the nir produces @xmath61 .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath62 relations are significantly less than the @xmath63 relation .",
    "the effect of the results from the   [ phot ] simulations can be seen by artificially and randomly introducing the distribution of @xmath64 mag to the k - band magnitudes .",
    "a comparison of @xmath58 and the adjusted @xmath65 is shown in figure  [ fig : simmag ] .",
    "the slope of the best fit relation ( dotted line ) is @xmath66 and no values of @xmath65 exceed @xmath67 .",
    "it is evident from both figures  [ fig : lsig ] and [ fig : dirsigmag ] that the dispersion of bcgs in the nir is considerably less than in the v - band .",
    "this is also the case for the e / s0s .",
    "even if we are underestimating the nir luminosities , it would require a very fortunate coincidence to have such a strong agreement between @xmath68 and @xmath46 across the entire mass function .",
    "it then follows that bcgs are not `` special '' when viewed at nir wavelengths .",
    "bcgs follow the same @xmath43 distribution as defined by less luminous spheroids , and comparable masses are predicted for the smbhs in bcgs based either on velocity dispersions or on total magnitudes .",
    "we have demonstrated , through extensive simulations , that the 2mass magnitudes used in this study are robust to within 0.5 mags for bcgs .",
    "this is consistent with the offset between the 2mass photometry and that of mh03 , who take the total magnitude components of srsic fits to two - dimensional photometric models .",
    "this offset is expected as the 2mass total magnitude integrations stop at @xmath21 .",
    "for the @xmath69 relations to predict a population of @xmath70 smbhs , i.e. , for the bcgs to fall on the one - to - one relation in figure  [ fig : vvsnir ] , 2mass photometry would have to be increased , on average , by 1.65 mags .",
    "this offset is inconsistent with the 2mass underestimates .",
    "the offset would also need to vary with @xmath44 and have no effect at masses below @xmath49 where the results between @xmath8 and @xmath69 are consistent .",
    "conversely , the v - band photometry must be overestimated by 2.17 mags , on average , for the upper limit of @xmath44 to be similar to that predicted from the nir .",
    "why then do bcgs show an excess of v - band light over their less massive cousins ?",
    "the issue could be resolved by considering the faint extended luminous halos known to surround the most massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "the signature of such halos is an inflection in the sbps at large @xmath71 . in the nir , the total magnitudes could be missing the contributions from faint halos or , alternatively",
    ", v - band luminosities could be interpreted as over - estimates due to the spurious inclusion of halo light . since extended",
    "halos predominantly sit in the overall cluster potential , they are unlikely to be related dynamically to the central regions from which the bcg @xmath3 is typically measured .",
    "photometry from further toward the blue end of the spectrum may be deep enough to include a significant contribution from these extended halos , leading to an increase in the estimation of bcgs luminosities and a turn - over in @xmath44 estimates above a certain threshold .",
    "while we have shown that bcgs are not `` special '' in terms of their @xmath43 distribution , nevertheless , their extreme luminosities and unique locations close to the centers of galaxy clusters suggest special formation processes . it has long been argued that the extended envelopes of bcgs are debris from tidally - stripped galaxies , and hence that they are associated more closely with the overall cluster potential well than with any single galaxy @xcite .",
    "the envelopes may also consist in part of stars formed in cooling flows @xcite .",
    "the presence of multiple nuclei in some bcgs argues in favor of these galaxies not being fully relaxed @xcite",
    ". a photometrically complete , high - resolution imaging survey of bcgs would be able to provide a framework for a more quantitative analysis of these fundamentally important objects .",
    "brightest cluster galaxies offer the chance to study the pinnacle of galaxy evolution .",
    "they also give us the opportunity to study the top of the smbh food chain by using the observed relations between @xmath44 and the properties of the surrounding host galaxy .",
    "we have shown that nir luminosities , combined with previously established scaling relations ( mh03 ) , imply a maximum mass of @xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with the most massive smbh directly modeled at the center of m87 @xcite and with the direct @xmath44 estimates of @xcite in 3 bcgs .",
    "we also find that , across all values , smbh masses predicted using nir magnitudes are consistent with masses predicted from @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , we have shown that bcgs follow the same distribution , as defined by e / s0 galaxies , in the @xmath43 relation .",
    "if confirmed by a deep multiwavelength study , these findings could have important implications for the nature of the smbh mass function , and , as in the past , would show that nir data are to be preferred when estimating @xmath44 ( mh03 ) .",
    "while bcgs are likely not special  in the sense of hosting hyper - massive black holes or by defining a distinct population in the @xmath43 plane  they may be interesting by virtue of being surrounded by extended faint halos .",
    "the unique local bcg environment , deep within a cluster potential , could be the generator of these halos , which may be populated by younger stars tidally stripped from other cluster members or that are the results of intra - cluster gas accretion or other recent merger events .",
