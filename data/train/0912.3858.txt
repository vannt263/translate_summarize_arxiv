    "isoscalar giant resonances @xcite in medium and heavy nuclei are the pronounced manifestation of nuclear collective motion and , hence , they carry important information about the dynamics of the nuclear excitation process and the properties of the nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "although their systematic study started more than three decades ago , a number of challenging questions still remain open .",
    "for example , the observed compressional modes , like the @xmath5 isoscalar giant monopole resonance ( isgmr ) or the @xmath6 isoscalar giant dipole resonance ( isgdr ) , provide the optimal route to determine the nuclear matter incompressibility @xmath7 , a key quantity specifying the equation of state of nuclear matter . however , the compatibility of the @xmath7 values deduced from these two collective compressional modes is still under discussion ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance ( isgqr ) and the isovector giant dipole resonance ( ivgdr ) are well known in stable nuclei but it is remains unclear how these two modes evolve in the unstable neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "since the first observation of isgmr in @xmath1pb in the 70 s of the last century @xcite , this compressional excitation mode of @xmath1pb has been investigated in numerous experimental and theoretical studies due to its fundamental importance in the determination of the nuclear matter incompressibility @xmath7 . among the experimental tools , the spin and isospin",
    "zero @xmath0-particle remains the best probe for the isoscalar giant resonances with @xmath8 and the most pronounced observations of the isgmr in @xmath1pb have been made so far in the experiments , like the recent high - precision measurements of inelastic scattering at @xmath9 mev by the texas a&m university group @xcite and 386 mev by the osaka group @xcite .",
    "the exploratory theoretical studies of the isoscalar dipole mode were done in the early 80s by m.n .",
    "harakeh and a.e.l .",
    "dieperink @xcite , as well as by n. van giai and h. sagawa @xcite , but the first direct observation of the isgdr in the @xmath1pb@xmath10 reaction has been made only years later by davis _",
    "_ @xcite . like the isgmr ,",
    "the knowledge about the isgdr is of vital importance for the determination of the nuclear incompressibility @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "therefore , both the experiments at 240 mev @xcite and 386 mev @xcite were aimed at an accurate measurement of the isgdr strength distribution in @xmath1pb .",
    "one of the main problems in the experimental study of giant resonances has been , and still is , the difficulty to disentangle different modes when their energies overlap .",
    "for example , the excitation energy of isgmr in @xmath1pb has been accurately determined from the most forward part of the cross section measured at 240 mev to be @xmath11 mev @xcite while the experiment at 386 mev has deduced @xmath12 mev @xcite using essentially the same method of multipole decomposition analysis ( mda ) to disentangle the isgmr peak from a mixed spectrum of different ( @xmath13 ) excitations including , in particular , the low - energy peak of isgdr at an excitation energy around 13 mev @xcite .",
    "moreover , there exists a basic problem when experimental results need to be compared with those predicted by a theoretical structure model .",
    "it is common , in the theoretical works , to calculate the strength function @xmath14 associated with a given nuclear transition operator @xmath15 , that is , @xmath16 where @xmath17 labels a complete set of final states which can be excited by acting @xmath15 upon the ground state @xmath18 . in terms of single - particle degrees of freedom",
    ", the isoscalar @xmath19-multipole operator is given by @xmath20 in the case of the isoscalar monopole and dipole modes one has to replace @xmath21 by @xmath22 . the predicted strength function ( [ st1 ] ) is then used to compare with the corresponding experimental strength distribution deduced for the considered @xmath19-multipole isoscalar excitation . in reality , however , the measured inelastic scattering data are inclusive spectra over a wide energy range which contain the strengths of isoscalar excitations with different multipolarities as well as the contamination by the continuum background .",
    "the ` experimental ' strength function for a given @xmath19-multipole excitation depends strongly , therefore , on both the method to exclude continuum background and the mda to disentangle contribution of a given multipole from the inelastic scattering spectrum . as a result",
    ", the comparison between the theoretical and experimental strength functions can be made in many cases only qualitatively .",
    "nevertheless , a more direct and quantitative comparison between theory and experiment is possible if the nuclear structure information is accurately included into a microscopic description of the inelastic scattering cross section measured for a given peak of the resonance energy , within either the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) or coupled - channel formalism @xcite .",
    "the well - known portal of this procedure is the double - folding model ( dfm ) which uses the nuclear ground state and transition densities of the @xmath0-projectile and target nucleus and an effective nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath23 ) interaction to calculate the optical potential ( op ) and inelastic scattering form factors ( ff ) of different multipolarities for the dwba calculation ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we note that the single - folding method @xcite has been widely used to calculate the inelastic scattering ff , using an appropriate @xmath0-nucleon interaction and nuclear transition densities given by the collective model , for the multipole decomposition analysis of the experimental spectrum within dwba @xcite . in this respect",
    ", the dfm calculation of the inelastic scattering ff using a realistic effective @xmath23 interaction can be used to probe the transition strength extracted from the mda for a given isoscalar excitation as well as the reliability of different choices for the nuclear transition densities .",
    "the latter aspect is quite essential because the collective model transition density has been shown to be reasonable for the collective modes which are , as a rule , concentrated in a limited energy region while other parts of the spectrum could be dominated by pure particle - hole states or states with intermediate character .",
    "we note further that the existing structure models have been substantially improved in recent years and the nuclear linear response theory has been used successfully to describe the excitation of vibrational modes . in a magic nucleus like @xmath1pb where the pairing does not manifest itself , this linear response approach",
    "is also known as random phase approximation ( rpa ) method .",
    "rpa has been formulated many years ago , but only recently the fully selfconsistent calculations without crude approximations have become available .",
    "therefore , it is also timely to study the inelastic scattering data measured recently for the known isoscalar modes to see how the rpa nuclear wave functions can be probed in the folding + dwba analysis of these data . to this goal , we have performed in the present work a detailed folding model analysis of the high - precision inelastic scattering data measured at @xmath2 mev @xcite and 386 mev @xcite , using a _",

    "the main conclusions and perspectives are given in the summary .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the theoretical model used to calculate the inelastic cross sections in the dwba . as mentioned above , our microscopic study of the inelastic scattering is based on the double - folding model @xcite which uses the nuclear ground state and transition densities of the @xmath0-projectile and target nucleus and an appropriate effective @xmath23 interaction to calculate the op and inelastic scattering ff for the dwba analysis .",
    "the nuclear structure information on the isoscalar giant resonances in @xmath1pb is embedded in the nuclear transition densities used in the folding calculation of the inelastic scattering ff .",
    "two choices of the nuclear transition densities were used in the present work : the phenomenological transition densities given by the collective model ( discussed below in sec .",

    "[ rpa ] ) .      among various choices of the effective @xmath23 interaction ,",

    "the density dependent parameters of the cdm3y6 interaction were carefully adjusted in the hartree - fock ( hf ) scheme to reproduce the saturation properties of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the first version of the cdm3y6 interaction is _ real _ and can be used to predict the real op and inelastic scattering ff only . to avoid a phenomenological choice of the imaginary op and inelastic scattering ff ,",

    "it has been shown in our recent work @xcite that the same form of the cdm3y functional @xcite can be used to obtain the density dependence of the _ imaginary _ term .",

    "the inclusion of the anharmonic effects is expected not only to redistribute the strength of the resonance rpa state over the energy like the averaging procedure ( [ aver ] ) , but also to pull down the predicted excitation energy to a lower value .",

    "[ f10 ] ) ; this shift is precisely associated with 2p-2h coupling or in other words , as stated above , to the renormalization of the effective mass @xmath175 .",
    "nevertheless , such a perfect agreement of the dwba cross section predicted by the total rpa transition density with the data measured for the isgqr peak ( see upper panel of fig .  [ f13 ] ) without any fine - tuning of the ff strength is very encouraging .",
    "this result confirms the realistic shape of the rpa transition density shown in fig .",
    "[ f12 ] and stresses once more the strong predicting power of the rpa approach .    for the isgmr , the dfm + dwba calculation using a single transition density ( [ rpa1 ] ) for the collective rpa state near",
    "the isgmr peak predicts values of the cross section quite close to the data in magnitude but with a deep oscillation pattern that can be smoothed out only by adding the contributions from other multipoles .",
    "such a behavior of the cross section calculated for the isgmr excitation in @xmath1pb has been seen in the earlier folding model studies @xcite .",
    "although the non - zero multipole @xmath101 transition strengths predicted by the rpa for the energy bin centered at @xmath176 mev are somewhat weaker than those given by the mda of 240 mev data ( see tables  [ t2 ] and [ t3 ] ) , their contributions are still essential in smoothing out the deep oscillation of the dwba cross section predicted by the @xmath104 transition . given the quite accurate rpa description of both the @xmath104 strength distribution ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ f9 ] ) and of the cross section measured for the isgmr peak ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ f13 ] ) without any readjustment of the model parameters and shift of the excitation energy , we conclude that the rpa is indeed a reliable theoretical approach to study the gmr excitations in nuclei .    for the isgdr , the dfm + dwba calculation using the total rpa transition densities",
    "( [ rpa1 ] ) for @xmath177 in the energy bin centered at @xmath178 mev reproduces very well the angular distribution measured at 240 mev ( see lower panel of fig .",
    "[ f13 ] ) . the main difference between these results and the dfm + dwba results",
    "given by the cm transition densities shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] is that the rpa predicts quite a strong @xmath118 strength in this energy bin ( @xmath179 ) compared to that deduced from the mda of 240 mev data ( @xmath180 ) , while the @xmath117 strength predicted by the rpa is about 60% weaker than the mda value . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath118 transition turned out to give a dominant contribution to the dwba cross section for the energy bin centered at @xmath178 mev .",
    "in conclusion , our study of the isgmr , isgqr and isgdr strength distributions and inelastic scattering angular distributions measured at the corresponding resonance peaks using the rpa transition densities has shown that the rpa approach can be successfully used to describe not only the @xmath101 strength distribution and integral properties of the giant resonances , but also the ( double ) differential @xmath181 cross sections . although there are some differences in the @xmath101 strengths of non - collective states , the isgmr , isgqr and isgdr strength distributions predicted by the _ averaged _ rpa results agree reasonably good with those deduced from the mda of the data ( see table  [ t2 ] and figs .",
    "[ f9 ] , [ f10 ] and [ f12 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath101 transition strengths as well as the location of the isgqr and isgdr peaks originally predicted by the rpa are significantly higher than those given by the mda of the considered data .",
    "this effect can be qualitatively explained by the lack of the ( beyond rpa ) anharmonic contributions from , e.g. , the 2p-2h coupling .",
    "therefore , it would be of further interest to perform the same dfm + dwba analysis including effects beyond the rpa since a self - consistent microscopic calculation beyond rpa coupled to an accurate reaction framework does not exist yet , to our knowledge . the effects , which have been introduced _",
    "ad hoc _ in the present work via the shift of the rpa mean peak(s ) downwards and spreading ( [ aver])-([aver1 ] ) of the discrete rpa strength , are exactly those included microscopically into a second rpa , or rpa plus phonon coupling ( rpa - pc ) calculations ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this sense",
    ", the present results are encouraging .",
    "in particular , the effects of 2p-2h coupling on the isgmr are expected to be small due to well - known cancellation effects and this goes along with the fact that our present simple rpa gives a very good dfm + dwba description of the monopole excitation .",
    "the generalized double - folding approach of refs .",
    "@xcite has been further developed for the microscopic study of isoscalar giant resonances induced by inelastic scattering , using the nuclear transition densities given by both the collective model and microscopic self - consistent rpa calculation .",
    "although the single - folding approach @xcite has been often used to compute the potential in the mda of the data , we have shown in the present work a significant difference in the cross sections given by the single- and double - folding methods .",
    "the dfm has also been suggested earlier @xcite as a more accurate approach to obtain realistic results for the inelastic and hi scattering , in particular , the ewsr fractions exhausted by different @xmath101 excitation modes .",
    "therefore , the present combination of the dfm and dwba approaches should be a reliable alternative method to be used in the mda of future measurements .",
    "a reasonable dfm + dwba description of the 240 mev data in energy bins centered at the isgmr , isgqr and isgdr peaks in @xmath1pb has been obtained with the cm nuclear transition densities built upon the @xmath101 strengths given by the mda of these data .",
    "our similar study of the inelastic scattering at @xmath105 mev strongly underestimates the data points measured in the same energy bins and , thus , shows quite a strong contribution by the excitation modes of higher multipole ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "the contribution by higher multipole excitation modes was found significantly different in the two energy regions around 10 mev and above 20 mev , which suggests that the maximum angular momentum @xmath148 taken into account in the mda series ( [ mda ] ) should be energy dependent .",
    "the present dfm + dwba method has also provided an accurate direct link between the _ discrete _ rpa approach ( which was used in the past to describe mainly the integral properties of the giant resonances ) and the experimental double differential cross sections measured for the resonance peaks . given high - precision data for the isoscalar giant resonances under study , our method can be used in the future to probe the accuracy of the microscopic prediction by different structure models for the energy distribution of the @xmath182 strength as well as the inelastic scattering @xmath181 cross section . in such a connection",
    ", we would like to emphasize again that the latter is very sensitive to the interference of different @xmath101 contributions .",
