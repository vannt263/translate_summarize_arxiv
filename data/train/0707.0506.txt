    "from its discovery as an eclipsing x - ray binary star emitting relativistic jets , the distance to ss433 and the w50 supernova remnant ( snr ) in which it is embedded has been somewhat uncertain .",
    "the peculiar and exciting properties of this system were first described by @xcite , who estimated its kinematic distance as 3.5 kpc from observations of the velocity of highly saturated foreground interstellar naii lines and a straightforward model for galactic rotation .",
    "as the properties of ss433 became better understood  it is a compact object in a binary system ejecting relativistic jets along an axis which precesses through small angles  the determination of its distance became more important in fixing the physical size of the observed phenomena . from a measurement of the proper motion of individual radio structures within the ss433 jets , and the assumption of a constant jet velocity",
    ", @xcite derived a distance of @xmath12 kpc , which was soon adopted as the canonical value for the system @xcite .",
    "figure  [ schematic ] shows ss433 and w50 in relation to the galactic plane and other objects in the same part of the sky .",
    "ss433 is located at @xmath13 , in the centre of the radio continuum source w50 , which is thought to be either a supernova remnant or a stellar wind bubble @xcite .",
    "the ss433 system consists of a compact object surrounded by an accretion disc and a ` donor ' star , of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "material from the donor star passes to an accretion disc surrounding the compact object and generates two relativistic jets moving at 0.26c in opposite directions which have apparently created the lobes ( or `` ears '' ) punched through the rim of the circular snr w50 @xcite .",
    "the jet axis precesses with a cone opening angle of @xmath15 around a position angle of @xmath16 @xcite , though at their maximum extent they show evidence of having been collimated to an effective opening angle @xmath17 @xcite . the jet closer to the galactic plane is usually referred to as the ` western ' jet and the other as the ` eastern '",
    "the presence of a @xmath18 ( hence young ) star in ss433 clearly marks this system as part of population i , a classification whose implications we will discuss in @xmath19 .    the stellar component of ss433 can not be assigned a distance from traditional spectro - phometric or kinematic techniques : the nature of the donor star is still uncertain @xcite , as is the extinction , while the optical systemic radial velocity of @xmath20 km  s@xmath1 ( @xmath21 ) may have a significant random component acquired during the supernova ( sn ) @xcite .",
    "but as a radio source , ss433 can be used as a target for hi absorption measurements : the kinematics of the intervening gas seen in absorption can provide limits on the location of ss433 , limits which are not likely to be affected by conditions close to the source itself @xcite .",
    "such measurements were first made by @xcite and showed that ss433 , and by implication the entire w50 remnant , absorbed hi only at a @xmath22 km  s@xmath1 , which limits the kinematic distance to @xmath23 kpc .",
    "the authors noted that their measurements might be consistent with a kinematic distance of as much as 4.7 kpc , but this rather uncertain upper limit was rendered less probable by subsequent observations of hi absorption toward the extragalactic radio continuum source b1910 + 052 only @xmath24 from ss433 ( fig .",
    "[ schematic ] ) , which has a rich absorption spectrum at all velocities up to the maximum allowed from galactic rotation @xcite .",
    "this implies that if ss433 were actually 5 kpc from the sun , hi should be seen in absorption against it to at least 75 km  s@xmath1 , more than 20 km  s@xmath1 higher than was detected .",
    "( throughout this paper velocities are given with respect to the lsr defined from `` standard solar motion '' @xcite unless otherwise noted . )",
    "observations of @xmath0co from molecular gas added to the puzzle .",
    "ss433/w50 lies more than 2 degrees from the galactic plane , an uncommonly large latitude for population i objects in the inner galaxy except for those quite near to the sun",
    ". observations of @xmath0co showed that there is a large molecular cloud covering ss433 with a velocity in the range 2736 km  s@xmath1 and an implied distance of 2.2 kpc @xcite , though the ` far ' kinematic distance of @xmath25 kpc might also be possible .",
    "the @xmath0co data did not show strong kinematic or morphological evidence for an interaction between w50 and the molecular cloud , but the coincidence of an snr and molecular cloud @xmath26 from the galactic plane was thought to make their association likely .",
    "furthermore , the hii region s74 lies projected on the edge of the w50 remnant ( fig .  1 ) , between the remnant and the galactic plane .",
    "s74 is associated with @xmath0co emission at 48 km  s@xmath1 and the spectro - photometric distance to its exciting star is reported as @xmath27 kpc @xcite , though the quality of this distance determination is unclear . at a distance of 2.1",
    "kpc s74 is about 50 pc below the plane , well within the range of displacements of hii regions in the inner galaxy @xcite .",
    "ss433/w50 might thus plausibly be connected with s74 , another population i object , were they actually near each other along the line of sight .    the energetic event which produced the w50 remnant , and the action of the ss433 jets ,",
    "should leave some mark on the interstellar medium ( ism ) , for most of the kinetic energy of the jets is not radiated @xcite .",
    "a study of the hi emission around w50 at @xmath28 angular resolution @xcite reported evidence of an interaction between w50 and the neutral ism at velocities ranging from 35 to 50 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite combined their data with previous hi measurements toward w50 @xcite , to propose a model in which w50 has a systemic velocity of @xmath29 km  s@xmath1 and is surrounded by a shell of hi expanding at @xmath30 km  s@xmath1 . the kinematic distance proposed for ss433/w50 by dubner et al .",
    "is @xmath31 kpc .",
    "recently a new distance estimate for ss433 has been derived by @xcite , who fitted a high - resolution radio observation of the ss433 jets to a projection of the standard kinematic model over two complete precession cycles of the jets , and analyzed asymmetries in the radio structure over arc - second scales caused by light - travel time effects .",
    "they find a distance of @xmath3 kpc , which differs by as much as a factor @xmath32 from distance estimates based on the association between ss433/w50 and interstellar matter .    the discrepancy has prompted us to obtain new hi absorption , hi emission and @xmath0co measurements of the ss433/w50 system to reassess the contradictory evidence . in this paper",
    "we discuss the galactic kinematics in the direction of ss433 , present the new hi and co data , then show that they are entirely consistent with a distance of 5.5kpc for the system .",
    "we also find evidence in the new hi emission data for interaction between ss433/w50 and the ambient ism , for a static ring or hi shell around w50 , and for an expanding hi shell which may be ` fossil ' evidence that the eastern jet of ss433 once extended past the current boundries of the radio continuum source .",
    "the very large array ( vla ) of the nrao was used to observe ss433 during two periods of about 40 minutes each on 5 june 1998 when it was being moved from a to b configuration . the nearby 1.2-jy object j1950 + 081",

    "a 2nd order polynominal was fitted to emission - free regions of the spectra , and the rms noise in the final spectra is 0.10 k.    the hi emission associated with ss433 is relatively bright , so stray radiation from gbt sidelobes @xcite should not be an issue here .",
    "there was , however , a small error in the velocity tracking while observing some portions of the mapped region , which resulted in an @xmath43 km  s@xmath1 error in the velocity scale of many spectra .",

    "the line of sight to ss433 at @xmath57 lies beyond the region of the galaxy influenced by strong streaming motions around the galactic bar ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but large - scale density wave motions may still be important ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the absence of hi absorption toward ss433 at velocities @xmath68 km  s@xmath1 , which is the terminal velocity where absorption is seen toward b1910 + 05 , implies that ss433 is nearer than the tangent point distance @xmath69 kpc",
    ". thus the hi absorption data taken in total give @xmath2 kpc .",
    "these values are consistent with the distance derived from a light - travel time analysis and we therefore adopt the @xcite distance of @xmath70 kpc , and take @xmath71 km  s@xmath1 as the systemic velocity of the the equivalent standard of rest of the ss433/w50 system , where the uncertainty is the typical random motion of cool hi clouds @xcite .",
    "this velocity is close to the mean velocity of the ss433 binary system @xcite , which , however , may have a significant peculiar velocity acquired during the sn event .",
    "this is discussed more fully in @xmath19 .",
    "in this section we examine the evidence that ss433 is interacting with a molecular cloud at a velocity of about 30 km  s@xmath1 , as has been suggested by some previous work @xcite .",
    "figure  [ cospect ] shows a @xmath0co spectrum towards ss433 derived from the new observations with the fcrao , while figure  [ comaps ] shows the @xmath0co emission integrated over the velocity range 2238 km  s@xmath1 .",

    "@xmath0co emission associated with s74 is seen only between 40 and 47 km  s@xmath1 , and only in the immediate vicinity of the nebula .",
    "there is no @xmath0co at the velocity of s74 within the boundries of w50 , so the hii region s74 seems also to be a chance overlap on the sky with the edge of the remnant .",

    "the western lobe of ss433 terminates at @xmath75 where the w50 radio continuum contours sit in a slight cavity in the hi , seen most clearly at @xmath76 km  s@xmath1 , e.g. , at the 83 km  s@xmath1 emission shown in figure  [ ringv83 ] .",
    "it is likely that the interaction is more visible at the higher velocities simply because there is less confusion from unrelated emission .",
    "the eastern lobe of the continuum source terminates abruptly at the edge of a well - defined expanding shell of hi , shown at several velocities in figure  [ lb_bubble ] .",
    "the shell is at its maximum angular extent at the velocities of the top two panels of the figure , and at its greatest velocity in the lower left panel , where it has contracted to a single receding ` cap ' .",
    "the expanding shell is open to the south , perpendicular to the axis of the jet , and may also have a gap where it overlaps the continuum lobe itself .",

    "moreover , the hi at 40 km  s@xmath1 does not seem to be concentrated into a single cloud , which might , however improbably , be co - located with ss433 yet have a peculiar velocity of 35 km  s@xmath1 .",

    "morphology we find it implausible that the 40 km  s@xmath1 feature is associated with ss433/w50 .",
    "the least gratifying but most likely circumstance given all the evidence is that the apparent connection at this velocity is a coincidential overlap along our line of sight of an unrelated hi feature . whereas the expanding shell and ring discussed in the previous section have both a spatial and kinematic correspondance with the ss433/w50 system , the void at 40 km  s@xmath1 matches only in its general shape .",
    "we conclude that it is unlikely that the apparent hi void at 40 km  s@xmath1 is related to ss433 .",

    "this was assumed to be material accelerated by w50 .",
    "the gbt data show no evidence for an excess of hi toward w50 at velocities @xmath121 km  s@xmath1 to a level of @xmath122 @xmath123 , and thus we find no evidence of a high - velocity receding neutral shell around w50 .",
    "@xcite suggested that a ridge of hi in their data near 35 km  s@xmath1 might be material accelerated by the shock front associated with the near - side expansion of w50 .",
    "there was also some evidence from earlier hi observations of a shell around w50 at this velocity @xcite .",
    "the gbt image is shown in figure  [ lb_v-35 ] with @xmath124 scaled by @xmath100 to reduce the strong latitude gradient .",
    "we can find no concentration of hi that has a clear association with w50 in this velocity range .",
    "[ lb_bubble_v-14 ] shows the image of the hi emission feature labelled ` n ' in figs .  9 and 10 .",
    "we are doubtful of any association with the expanding shell simply because its velocity of -14 km  s@xmath1 is so extremely different from that of the rest of the shell .",
    "nonetheless , it is relatively compact and is projected on the centre of the expanding shell , so we consider the consequences of its association .",
    "this component has a peak @xmath125 @xmath85 with a linewidth @xmath126 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the position of its peak is @xmath127 and it extends @xmath128 in longitude at @xmath129 in latitude for a size @xmath130 pc , where @xmath131 is the distance in units of 5.5 kpc .",
    "its hi mass is @xmath132 , and if it has been ejected from the expanding shell , its kinetic energy would be @xmath133 ergs .",
    "we will not discuss this cloud any further as we consider it unlikely to be associated with the expanding shell , whose systemic velocity is @xmath134 km  s@xmath1 and which seems to be a very regular structure with a uniform expansion velocity of @xmath135 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "most studies of the ss433 system conclude that it is comprised of a compact object ( possibly a black hole ) which likely began its life as an o star , and a ` donor ' star of mass @xmath136 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . by these standards",
    ", the system must be relatively young and belong to galactic population i. it is located , however , quite far from the galactic plane .",
    "the young , massive stars in the inner galaxy traced by hii regions have a vertical distribution with a dispersion @xmath137 pc , consistent with the scale height of ob stars in the solar neighbourhood @xcite . at a distance from the galactic plane",
    "@xmath138 pc , the location of ss433 is certainly unusual , and as a massive binary it would have attracted notice even if it had not become an extraordinary system .",
    "its isolation is illustrated in figure  [ ss433ingalaxy ] , which shows the radio continuum with respect to molecular clouds and hii regions in its area of the galaxy . as noted in @xmath139 ,",
    "there is no trace of a molecular cloud at its longitude , latitude and velocity .",
    "it is thus highly likely that it was formed near the plane and not at its present location , and must have acquired a peculiar vertical velocity @xmath140 km  s@xmath1 to reach z=215 pc .",
    "most , if not all , early - type stars found far from the galactic plane are runaways which have been ejected from their parent cluster @xcite .",
    "some have a proper motion which allows them to be traced back to their origin ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "binary stars can also be ejected from young clusters .",
    "the frequency of binaries among early - type runaway stars is small , but not zero @xcite , and theoretical studies suggest that binaries containing massive stars can be ejected from clusters at velocities @xmath141 km  s@xmath1 ; the more massive the system ejected , the lower the ejection velocity @xcite . at the location in the galaxy of ss433 , an object launched from @xmath142 with a vertical velocity @xmath143 km  s@xmath1 in the galactic potential given by @xcite will reach the altitude of ss433 in about 8 myr . as importantly , because of the long turn - around time , it will stay at @xmath144 pc for between 8 and 18 myr after leaving the plane .",
    "this corresponds to the main sequence lifetime of stars with @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "it is thus reasonable that ss433 began in one of the young clusters in the galactic plane , was given a random kick of a few tens of km  s@xmath1 ( comparable to the velocity dispersion of the population of runaway ob stars @xcite ) , and made its way as an ob binary to @xmath144 pc where the more massive star became a sn forming w50 and ss433 .",
    "the other possibility is that the supernova occured while the binary was still in the galactic plane and the sn caused its own ejection @xcite , now with a compact object as one member of the system @xcite .",
    "arguments for this scenario are summarised by @xcite , who notes that it would find support if ss433 has a peculiar velocity directed away from the galactic plane .",
    "recent astrometric studies of ss433 using the vlba have been made at three epochs ( a.  mioduszewski and m.  rupen , private communication ) and a proper motion has been detected .",
    "those results will be described in full elsewhere ; here we use them in the discussion of the origin of ss433 and its interaction with the ism .",
    "the mioduszewski and rupen measurements in march 1998 and august 2005 combine to give a proper motion @xmath146 and @xmath147 milli - arcsec per year . at a distance of 5.5 kpc and a heliocentric velocity of @xmath148 km  s@xmath1 @xcite",
    ", we derive velocities relative to the lsr ( standard solar motion ) of @xmath149 , @xmath150 km  s@xmath1 , where @xmath151 is positive radially outward from the galactic centre , @xmath152 is positive in the direction of galactic rotation , and @xmath153 is positive toward the north galactic pole . for a flat rotation curve at @xmath154",
    "km  s@xmath1 , the velocities in a frame corotating at ss433 are v(ss433 ) = -17 , + 225 , + 30 km s@xmath1 in the r , @xmath155 and z directions , respectively .",
    "ss433 thus has peculiar velocities relative to its local standard of rest of -17 , + 5 , + 30 km  s@xmath1 , with uncertainties of perhaps 50% in each value .",
    "the measurements indicate that the total non - circular motion of ss433 is small , @xmath156 km  s@xmath1 , and directed mainly toward the galactic plane nearly along the axis of the western jet .",
    "these results allow us to constrain the history of the system .",
    "if the o star binary was created in the galactic plane and ejected before the sn stage , its age could be @xmath157 myr , where the inequality applies if the ejection velocity was more than the minimum needed to achieve its current distance from the plane .",
    "its current space velocity presumably reflects the kick that the system got during the sn , and contains no information on its history prior to the sn .",
    "alternatively , if the supernova occured in the galactic plane , and the system was then ejected , its current velocity reflects its dynamical history .",
    "it must have reached its greatest distance from the plane , turned around , and now be returning at @xmath158 km  s@xmath1 , which requires a total time of 22 myr in the galactic potential of @xcite .",
    "another factor is that ss433 lies at almost the exact centre of w50 measured transverse to the axis of the jets , but is offset by about 4 pc ( @xmath159 ) to the west along the jet axis as measured from the peak of the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "measured from the maximum extent of the radio lobes it is offset in the same direction by about 12 pc .",
    "some asymmetry in the extent of the w50 lobes is expected because they are moving nearly perpendicular to the galactic vertical density gradient , though in this case there are suggestions that local conditions may be atypical @xmath160 .",
    "the central part of w50 is , however , quite circular .",
    "if we ascribe the offset of ss433 to its proper motion , it implies a time from the formation of w50 of @xmath161 y. this is identical to the lifetime of ss433 estimated by @xcite adjusting their values for a distance of 5.5 kpc , a jet luminosity of @xmath162 ergs  s@xmath1 and an ambient density of 0.5 @xmath98 .",
    "we believe it is most likely that ss433 was formed not far from where we observe it today , when the more massive member of a binary which had been ejected from the plane underwent its sn phase about @xmath163 years ago .",
    "the radio continuum lobes aligned with the ss433 jets evidence interaction with the local ism : measured from ss433 , the lobe directed toward the galactic plane is 0.7 times the length of the lobe directed away from the plane .",
    "this is the expected ratio if the jet length is limited by swept - up interstellar matter in an hi layer with a vertical density profile given by @xcite . in the data presented here the most convincing imprint of this system on the ism",
    "is found at velocities near the systemic velocity of 75 km  s@xmath1 : the two hi shells , one expanding and the other static .",
    "while these have some resemblance to other interstellar shells , in detail they seem to be quite different .",
    ".properties of the ss433/w50 hi shells calculated for a distance of @xmath164 kpc .",
    "note : the property labelled radius measures the distance from the centre to the peak of emission . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]      is the expanding hi shell found just off the tip of the eastern jet related to , and possibly powered by ss433 ? the key properties of this system",
    "are summarised in table  1 .",
    "if we were to interpret this object as a bubble driven by a stellar wind @xcite , for the observed size and mean density its age would be @xmath165 years and the required mechanical wind luminosity @xmath166 ergs s@xmath1 or a total power of @xmath167 ergs .",
    "this might be supplied by a massive star with a wind velocity of 2000 km  s@xmath1 and a mass loss rate of @xmath168 m@xmath6 y@xmath1 ( e.g. , @xcite ) but we can find no evidence for such a star or any other energetic object within the shell , there is no radio continuum associated with the expanding shell in the maps of @xcite , and the shell is not visible in the x - ray maps from the rosat survey . moreover , its location nearly 400 pc below the galactic plane places it many scale - heights away from most population i objects .",
    "the edge of the shell , however , lies exactly on the termination of the radio continuum powered by the eastern jet of ss433 , its velocity is close to that of the ss433 system , and the projected jet axis goes precisely through the centre of the hi feature .",
    "the jets of ss433 have a kinetic luminosity @xmath169 ergs s@xmath1 @xcite , which could supply the necessary energy in @xmath170 years at an efficiency of @xmath92 .",
    "the creation of the shell might have been a brief episode in the life of ss433 , marked now only by the fossil record left in hi .",
    "this sequence of events is speculative , but if ss433 is the source of the shell , the shell age must be @xmath171 y , about an order of magnitude less than the age derived from simple application of the theory of wind - blown bubbles @xcite for an object with its properties .",
    "the static ring is problematic .",
    "it is blended with unrelated gas , is not symmetric about ss433 but is centred on the upper part of w50 , and it corresponds to the shape of the radio continuum only along the edge of the western lobe .",
    "indeed , its basic topology is uncertain .",
    "higher resolution hi observations are necessary .",
    "there are hi shells observed in the lmc with a size similar to that of the ring , shells with a low expansion velocity as well , but these usually surround ob associations , and may not be relevant to the shell around w50 .",
    "simple application of the equations for wind - blown bubbles @xcite assuming an expansion velocity of @xmath172 km  s@xmath1 , gives the rather large age of @xmath173 y. this is comparable to the free - fall time of an object from the location of ss433 back to the galactic plane , and is unlikely to be an accurate description of the age of the ring .",
    "the theory of bubbles and superbubbles has been reasonably successful when applied to the interstellar structures formed by winds and sn ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but it does not seem to give reasonable results for the static hi ring associated with ss433/w50 .      the average hi density , @xmath97 , is estimated to be 1  2 @xmath98 at the location of the ring around w50 ( @xmath174 pc ) , and 0.4  1.2 @xmath98 just below the end of the eastern jet at @xmath175 pc .",
    "these values are more than an order of magnitude greater than the densities expected at these distances from the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that there are other examples of well - defined hi shells which also appear to be expanding into substantially overdense regions @xcite .",
    "perhaps the prominence of w50 in the radio continuum is enhanced because of its accidental location in a large interstellar hi cloud .",
    "the new hi absorption data reconcile the kinematic distance to ss433 with the distance derived from an analysis of light - travel time effects @xcite . absorption at + 75 km  s@xmath1 is detected in two separate measurements at the @xmath67 significance level .",
    "all data now place ss433 at a distance 5.5 kpc from the sun with a systemic velocity @xmath176 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the hii region s74 and the molecular cloud at 30 km  s@xmath1 , both of which overlap parts of the w50 remnant , have no association with the system and most likely lie in the foreground , as suspected by @xcite . we also find no convincing evidence for an association of any hi with w50 at velocities other than near 75 km  s@xmath1 .    the determination of a modest proper motion of 35 km  s@xmath1 directed nearly along the western jet ( i.e. toward the galactic plane ) suggests that ss433 originated as an o - star binary which was ejected early in its life from a cluster near the galactic plane with a velocity away from the galactic plane @xmath140 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the sn of the more massive star then occured close to where we now observe the system , and in that event it was given a modest kick back toward the galactic plane .",
    "the location of ss433 near the centre of symmetry of the radio continuum source w50 suggests that the sn occured @xmath163 years ago .",
    "there is no molecular cloud ( as traced by co emission ) associated with the system , but there seem to be two hi features : a static ring or shell around the upper part of w50 , and an expanding shell touching the end of the eastern lobe .",
    "there are many hi shells in the ism @xcite often seen surrounding hii regions or clusters of young stars , in other instances without an identifiable source of energy @xcite , but well - developed hi shells around supernova remnants are rare .",
    "studies of individual remnants often show patchy fragmented structures , perhaps because remnants expand into a complex ism @xcite",
    ". it may be significant that the average interstellar density derived for both hi features around w50 is about an order of magnitude greater than what would be expected at their distance from the galactic plane .",
    "this seems to be a trend for some hi shells which are not near regions of star formation @xcite .",
    "the expanding shell is quite interesting , for its measured kinetic energy is so large ( @xmath177 ergs ) that it must have been formed by some energetic event , but it is quite far from the galactic plane and there is no nearby candidate energy source except for ss433 .",
    "it is possible that the shell is a fossil remnant of a time when the eastern jet extended out past the current radio continuum boundries  the jet has enough energy to create a bubble of this sort in @xmath178 years . on the other hand , there are examples of hi shells with unidentified energy sources , and it may be a challenge to understand how the kinetic energy of a collimated jet could produce a relatively symmetric expanding shell .",
    "the ss433 system is ideally situated for the study of the interaction between energetic events and the interstellar medium : it is separated from most confusing sources , accessible at many wavelengths , and has resonably well understood energetics . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the ss433 jets may offer a unique probe of the ism .",
    "further study of hi in this region should be rewarding .",
