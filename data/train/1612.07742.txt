    "market impact , i.e. the interplay between order flow and price dynamics , has increasingly attracted the attention of researchers and of the industry in the last years @xcite . despite its importance",
    "both from a fundamental point of view ( due to its relation with supply - demand ) and from an applied point of view ( due to its relation with transaction cost analysis and optimal execution ) , market impact is not yet fully understood and different models and approaches have been proposed and empirically tested .",
    "it is important to note that market impact refers to different aspects of this interplay and that they should be carefully distinguished ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "first , there is the impact of an individual trade or of the aggregated signed order flow in a fixed time period .",
    "second , especially for transaction cost analysis and optimal execution , it is more interesting to consider the impact of a large trade ( sometimes termed as _ meta - order _ ) executed incrementally by the same investor with many transactions and orders over a given interval of time .",
    "both these definitions of market impact are typically investigated by considering one asset at a time , i.e. without considering the effect of a trade ( or of an order ) in one asset on the price dynamics of another asset .",
    "this is the third type of impact , that we study in this paper , and that is termed _ cross - impact_. understanding and modeling cross - impact is important for many reasons , since it enters naturally in problems like optimal execution of portfolios , statistical arbitrage of a set of assets , and to study the relation between correlation in prices and correlation in order flows .",
    "conceptually , while self - impact , the impact of a trade on the price of the same asset , can qualitatively be understood as the result of a mechanical component ( e.g. a market order with volume larger than the volume at the opposite best ) and an induced component ( resilience of the order book due to liquidity replenishment ) , the source of cross - impact is less clear . on one side if a trader is liquidating simultaneously two assets one can obviously expect a non - vanishing cross - impact . since impact measures are typically averages across many measurements , this mechanism produces cross - impact if simultaneous trades and positively correlated order flow are frequently observed . on the other side ,",
    "liquidity providers and arbitrageurs detect local mispricing between correlated assets and bet on a reversion to normality by placing orders .",
    "in other words this induced cross - impact relates to the possibility of identifying price changes due to local imbalances of supply - demand in one asset ( rather than to fundamental information ) and of exploiting the possibly short - lived mispricing between correlated assets .",
    "even though cross - impact has already been discussed e.g. in @xcite as an extension of their optimal execution model and in @xcite in a principal component approach , it has only recently been the subject of extensive empirical studies .",
    "@xcite show that order imbalance has a significant impact on returns across stocks and sectors at the daily scale .",
    "@xcite present evidence for a structured price cross - response and correlated order flow at the intraday time - scale across stock pairs .",
    "@xcite link cross - response and order flow in a multivariate extension of the transient impact model ( tim ) of @xcite and show that their model can reproduce a significant part of the well - known correlation structure of asset returns .",
    "@xcite perform a scenario analysis in a similar model , finding that cross - response is related both to cross - impact and correlated order flow across assets .",
    "it is clear that the cross impact problem talks naturally to dynamic arbitrage and to the possibility of price manipulation , as already discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask which constraints the no - price - manipulation assumption imposes on market impact models .",
    "there is a large literature on this problem , often focused on the single asset case ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) .    in the multi - asset case",
    "many articles are concerned with strategies for optimal portfolio liquidation in the presence of volatility risk by expanding the model of @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that optimal execution strategies for investors with constant absolute risk aversion are deterministic and for a more general absolute risk aversion setting @xcite finds that the optimal strategies for investors with different risk preferences vary only in the speed of their execution .",
    "the case of cross - impact in a lit market when there is also a dark pool is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the paper most related to ours from a theoretical point of view is @xcite .",
    "they model multi - asset price impact by considering a linear version of the model of @xcite on a discrete - time grid , extending thus the model already considered in @xcite .",
    "they show that the absence of no - dynamic - arbitrage corresponds to the decay kernel being described by a positive definite matrix - valued function and formulate further conditions to ensure that resulting optimal strategies are well - behaved showing how they can be constructed .",
    "however it is not generally straightforward to establish positive definiteness when a decay kernel is obtained coordinate - wise from estimations and therefore necessary conditions for the absence of dynamic arbitrage that can be verified on estimated decay kernels prove useful .    in this paper ,",
    "focusing on the tim framework in continuous time , we establish some easily verifiable necessary conditions that must be satisfied by self- and cross - impact , in order to avoid the presence of price manipulation . we do this in the same spirit of @xcite by explicitly constructing trading strategies that lead to price manipulation and negative expected cost .",
    "some of these relations are simple generalizations to the multi - asset case of the corresponding relations for the single asset case derived in @xcite .",
    "other relations that we derive here are instead genuinely relative to the multi - asset case .",
    "in particular we formalize in lemma [ lemma : linbounded_symm ] that cross - impact must be symmetric , i.e. the return induced in asset @xmath0 by a trade of volume @xmath2 in asset @xmath1 must be equal to the impact of a trade of the same volume @xmath2 in asset @xmath0 on the price of asset @xmath1 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether this symmetry condition is empirically verified . in this paper",
    "we study a market whose microstructure , to the best of our knowledge , has not been explored so far .",
    "this is the mot market for sovereign bonds , a fully electronic limit order book market for fixed income assets .",
    "one of the reasons for our choice is that , due to the nature of the traded assets , we expect cross - impact , especially due to quote revisions , to be very high .",
    "in fact , two italian fixed - rate btps differ mostly through the coupon rate and the time - to - maturity - factors which are accounted for in the price , which moves in a very synchronised way since for most purposes both titles are perfectly interchangeable .    calibrating a multivariate tim in trade time",
    "we find that there exist pairings of bonds where the symmetry condition of cross - impact is violated in a statistically significant way . by comparing the potential profit from a simple arbitrage strategy to transaction costs such as the bid - ask spread , which are neglected in the model ,",
    "we conclude that arbitraging is not profitable .",
    "it is also crucial to point out that the empirical part of the paper is important because it is the first application of a tim model to fixed income markets and to the best of our knowledge it is the first work to consider cross - impact of single market orders and not the order sign imbalance aggregated over fixed time intervals ( as done in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] introduces our model and the links to the no - dynamic - arbitrage principle .",
    "section [ sec : generalconstraints ] discusses some general constraints on cross - impact that arise in our framework for bounded decay kernels and the corresponding proofs are given in appendix [ app : proofs ] . in section [ sec : empirical ] we study cross - impact empirically and compare to the theoretical results in section [ sec : generalconstraints ] .",
    "finally section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes .",
    "the presence of dynamic arbitrage depends on the market impact model . in this paper",
    "we consider the transient impact model ( tim ) introduced in @xcite ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "the model has been originally formulated in discrete time , and its continuous time version , that we present in the next section , has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite assumes that the asset price @xmath3 at time @xmath4 follows a random walk with a drift determined by the cumulative effect of previous trades @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the ( instantaneous ) impact of trading at a rate @xmath7 at time @xmath8 weighted by a decay kernel @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is a noise process , for example a wiener process , and @xmath12 is the volatility . for consistency with equation ( [ eq : cost_nd ] ) for the cost of trading , the trading rate @xmath13 is given in units of number of shares per unit of time . in our multivariate extension we consider the prices of a set of assets where the drift in asset @xmath0 not only depends on the trading history of asset @xmath0 but also on past trades in assets @xmath14 .",
    "thus the price process of asset @xmath0 is given by @xmath15 with a correlated noise process @xmath16",
    "( e.g. a multivariate wiener process ) and where in addition to the _ self - impact _",
    "terms @xmath17 and @xmath18 we have introduced additive _ cross - impact _ terms @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , that represent the impact of trading in asset @xmath1 on the price of asset @xmath0 . if for any pairing @xmath22",
    "both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are non - zero , then there is cross - impact from asset @xmath1 to asset @xmath0 .    for a trading strategy",
    "@xmath23 $ ] where @xmath24 is the vector of asset positions @xmath25 in asset @xmath0 at time @xmath4 , the expected cost ( or implementation shortfall ) is @xmath26 \\nonumber \\\\         & = \\sum_{i , j } { \\int_0^t { \\dot{x}^i_t \\mathrm{d}t \\int_0^t{f^{ij}(\\dot{x}^j_s ) g^{ij}(t - s ) \\mathrm{d}s    }   } } \\label{eq : cost_nd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where as in @xcite we consider only costs due to price impact , i.e. the price shift induced by our own trading , and neglect _ slippage costs _ , i.e. costs due to all other market frictions such as bid - ask spreads and trading fees . also @xcite ignore these costs by arguing that a sophisticated trading strategy consists not only of market orders but also of limit orders , thus on average both paying ( earning ) a half spread from market ( limit ) orders . in practice the constraints we derive may well be weakened when slippage costs are unavoidable , e.g. when immediacy requires to execute a trading strategy with market orders .",
    "let us for the remainder assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath27 is a dimensionless quantity , i.e. all dimensionality of cross - impact is captured by the instantaneous market impact function @xmath28 .",
    "moreover we assume that the decay kernel @xmath29 is _ bounded _ , i.e. when there exists an upper bound @xmath30 so that @xmath31 for all @xmath32 and all @xmath33 .. we do not consider these in this paper . ]",

    "@xcite define a _ round - trip trade _ as a sequence of trades whose sum is zero , i.e. a trading strategy @xmath36 with @xmath37 this implies a round - trip in all assets traded in the strategy , i.e. @xmath38 . a _ price manipulation _ is a round - trip trade @xmath39 whose expected cost @xmath40 is negative and the _ principle of no - dynamic - arbitrage _ states that such a price manipulation is impossible .",
    "formally , the principle requires that for any round trip trade @xmath39 it is @xmath41 in the one - dimensional case this translates to @xmath42 and imposes a relationship on the market impact function @xmath43 and the decay kernel @xmath44 . the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 are said to be _ consistent _",
    "if they exclude the possibility of price manipulation .",
    "several papers have studied the consistency of this kinds of market impact models ( @xcite ) .",
    "e.g. @xcite show that any decay kernel that is non - singular at time zero is inconsistent with non - linear @xmath43 .",
    "moreover @xcite sets some necessary constraints for no arbitrage for power law dependence of @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xcite show that inconsistencies can also arise for power - law @xmath43 and @xmath44 even when necessary conditions derived in @xcite are not violated .    in the multidimensional case the cost requirement is @xmath47 and we are similarly looking at",
    "what forms of @xmath48 and @xmath49 are consistent when there is cross - impact .",
    "specifically we are asking what limits there are to cross - impact , i.e. the form of @xmath50 , and whether the presence of cross - impact leads to possible arbitrages in pairs of @xmath48 and @xmath49 that are consistent in the one - dimensional case .",
    "in the following we consider the two - dimensional case , @xmath51 , i.e. the number of assets @xmath52 .",
    "note that all results from the one - dimensional case still hold since we are free to choose a trading strategy that focuses only on one asset , e.g. @xmath53 $ ] where @xmath54 is a round - trip trading strategy in asset @xmath55 . in this section",
    "we assume that the decay kernel @xmath56 is non - increasing , bounded and therefore normalized as well as right - continuous at @xmath57 in all components .",
    "a special case of such a kernel is exponential decay @xmath58 as in @xcite .",
    "the proofs of the results in this section are given in appendix [ app : proofs ] and are obtained following the approach of @xcite .",
    "all results can also be obtained following @xcite under the slightly more restricting assumptions of the decay kernel @xmath59 being representable as a suitable series expansion and considering only the first non - zero orders in the limit of @xmath60 .      in the following",
    "we will often make use of a simple strategy in two assets where trading is split into two phases of trading at constant rates .    a simple in - out strategy .",
    "[ eg : strategy_easy ] + at first we build up a position at a constant trading rate from time @xmath61 until time @xmath62 , with @xmath63 , and then liquidate the position in a second phase from @xmath62 until @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65    the velocities @xmath66 , @xmath67 are constrained by our choice of the strategy .",
    "since @xmath39 is a round - trip strategy , the trading rates @xmath66 and @xmath67 have opposite signs , i.e. @xmath68 , and the time @xmath62 when the trading direction changes is given as @xmath69 .",
    "let us further fix notation with @xmath70 .",
    "the cost of this strategy can be decomposed as @xmath71 where @xmath72    in the one - dimensional case the principle of no - dynamic - arbitrage imposes a constraint on the term @xmath73 which is negative due to the change in trading rate and from equation ( [ eq : nodynamicarb_nd ] ) it follows that @xmath74 as in @xcite . for the multi - dimensional case",
    "@xmath75 further implies a relationship between the strength of cross - impact and self - impact .    in the following we will try to exploit cross - impact in order to push down the cost of strategies",
    "supposing that cross - impact is positive for positive trading rates , i.e. @xmath76 for @xmath77 , we can choose @xmath78 , e.g. trading into asset @xmath55 while contemporaneously trading out of asset @xmath79 , in order to get a negative contribution from cross - impact",
    ".      in the one - dimensional case @xcite shows that permanent market impact needs to be an odd function in the rate of trading @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath80 .",

    "@xcite consider this problem in discrete time with linear instantaneous price impact .",
    "their proposition 2.6 states that absence of arbitrage in the sense of equation ( [ eq : nodynamicarb_nd ] ) is equivalent to the condition that the product of strength of impact and the decay kernel corresponds to a positive definite matrix - valued function .",
    "@xcite finds that any single - asset market impact model as in equation ( [ eq : price_1d ] ) is inconsistent when @xmath45 is non - linear and @xmath46 is bounded and non - increasing .",

    "then such a model admits price manipulation and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are inconsistent .    as a corollary of lemma [ lemma : finite_linear ] we can extend lemma 4.1 in @xcite for self - impact to the case with cross - impact .",

    "we obtain the same corollary for purely permanent impact in the limit @xmath97 , as already observed in @xcite :    nonlinear permanent self- and cross - asset market impact is inconsistent with the principle of no - dynamic - arbitrage .",
    "again we assume that @xmath27 is bounded , non - increasing and continuous around @xmath57 and therefore that impact is linear , i.e. @xmath98 , for otherwise our model is inconsistent , as shown in the previous section .",
    "we will further show that in this case impact needs to be symmetric , i.e. @xmath99 , in order to avoid price manipulations .",
    "an asymmetric strategy with purely permanent and linear impact .",
    "[ eg : linperm_asymm ] + suppose market impact is linear and permanent , i.e. @xmath98 and @xmath100 . then the cost of trading in the single - asset case only depends on the initial and final positions @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "if there is cross - impact between two or more assets , there is also an interaction term between the trading rates in different assets , i.e. @xmath103 and while the first sum disappears for a round - trip strategy since @xmath104 , this is not generally the case for the second sum . to see this ,",
    "let us consider a different round - trip strategy @xmath39 in two assets , which is now asymmetric and lasts over three phases : @xmath105    while the self - impact cancels out when we calculate @xmath40 , the asymmetry in our strategy makes for a non - trivial total cost that stems from cross - impact : @xmath106 if @xmath107 this gives a negative cost and likewise when @xmath108 by interchanging assets @xmath109 in the strategy ( [ eq : strategy_asymm ] ) .",
    "therefore it follows that cross - impact needs to be symmetric with respect to asset pairs in order to exclude arbitrage opportunities , as observed in @xcite .",

    "however we have verified that our results are qualitatively similar when considering de - meaned order signs @xmath148 or @xmath149 and de - meaned returns .",
    "we define the self- and cross - response function @xmath150 as the unconditional @xmath151-ahead return in asset @xmath0 controlled for the order sign of asset @xmath1 : @xmath152 .",
    "\\label{eq : response_function_r}\\ ] ] for @xmath153 we will speak of _ self - response _ and of _ cross - response _ for @xmath154 . figure [ fig : response_function ] shows the average self- and cross - response function for all bonds in our sample and their pairings respectively .    for positive lags @xmath151",
    "we find that self - response is on average larger than cross - response by a factor of @xmath155 , consistent with observations of @xcite .",
    "@xmath156 is zero by definition , whereas for small negative @xmath151 we find that @xmath157 is on average positive , producing a cusp at @xmath158 .",
    "we conjecture that such behavior is not observed in @xcite because of the rather large time lag of 5 minutes , corresponding to @xmath159 units of transaction time in figure [ fig : response_function ] . in the single asset case",
    "this feature is clearly present for the large - tick stock microsoft in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "as shown there , the kink could be related to correlations of market order flow with past returns and indicates a forecasting power of current returns on the future order sign imbalance .",
    "interestingly we find that the cross - response measured at negative lags is smaller ( i.e. larger in absolute value ) than self - response , contrary to the observations in @xcite .",
    "the figure also shows the prediction from the model of the negative lag impact ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we observe a clear difference with the empirical data suggesting also for cross - impact a reaction of order flow to past price dynamics of other bonds .",
    "we measure the instantaneous market impact function @xmath160 as @xmath161 \\label{eq : f_measurement}\\ ] ] which is the expected return in asset @xmath0 from just before a trade at time @xmath4 until 2 seconds after @xmath4 , multiplied by the trade sign in asset @xmath1 at time @xmath4 and conditional on a trade in asset @xmath1 at time @xmath4 of size @xmath162 .",
    "we have chosen the two second interval as twice the maximum time between two updates of the limit order book , i.e. we can rule out that changes in the book were not reported in our data . for measurement purposes we bin similar trade sizes together , with the bin size chosen as a function of the number of trades in the triggering bond @xmath1 .     measured in units of face value .",
    "each line corresponds to one pairing @xmath22 , grouped by time - to - maturity into four categories , where impact is from the column on the row .",
    "self - impact is present on the diagonal panels and shown as red solid lines , cross - impact is shown as blue dashed lines and present in all panels .",
    "price impact is calculated as average price change ( multiplied by the trade sign ) after a lag of 2 seconds , the minimum time that ensures we observe an update of the limit order book .",
    "self- and cross - impact is clearly non - linear . for comparison",
    "the solid black line in the lower left panel illustrates a linear impact function . ]",
    "figure [ fig : f_measurement_all ] shows self- and cross - impact between all bonds in our sample as a function of trade size @xmath162 measured in units of face value .",
    "cross - impact is universally present across our sample and on average smaller than self - impact by roughly one order of magnitude .",
    "the cross - impact curves of different pairings @xmath22 are very close one to the other when both bonds have a time - to - maturity of at least four years left . for bonds with three or less years left until maturity we do not observe an intense trading activity , thus the curves in the leftmost column in the figure are very noisy .",
    "likely the price - dynamics of these short - term titles are more decoupled from the medium- and long - term bonds with a lifespan of four or more years .",
    "the figure shows that all the estimated functions @xmath163 are non - linear , being concave and well described by a power law behavior with an exponent smaller than 1 .",
    "this has been already observed in self - impact ( @xcite ) and is extended here to cross - impact .. however we should remember that what is shown in figure [ fig : f_measurement_all ] is the observed impact , which might be different from the virtual impact , since the former does not take into account the selection bias due to the fact that traders condition the market order volume to what is present at the opposite best . for a discussion of this point in the self - impact case , see @xcite . ]",
    "having established this evidence for cross - impact , we investigate the possible origin of cross - impact . is this due to correlated trades across assets ( e.g. a strategy trading simultaneously several bonds ) or is it mostly due to quote revision following a trade , leading to changes of the mid - price of a bond in the absence of trades ? to discriminate between these alternatives , we repeat the analysis in figure [ fig : f_measurement_all ] and distinguish now whether there were any trades beyond the triggering one in any other bond in our sample during a period from 3 seconds before to 2 seconds after the triggering transaction , which we will call _ isolated trades_.    , where impact is from the column on the row . self - impact is present on the diagonal panels in red , cross - impact on the off - diagonals in blue .",
    "solid lines show the market impact function based on all trades as in figure [ fig : f_measurement_all ] , dotted lines show market impact based on isolated trades only , i.e. when there was no other transaction from 3 seconds before to 2 seconds after the triggering trade . ]    for better readability in figure [ fig : f_measurement_sametime ] we focus on the four most recently issued 30 year btps in our sample , which were shown in the lower right panel of figure [ fig : f_measurement_all ] .",
    "results are similar for all other pairs of bonds .",
    "when we consider market impact of isolated trades only , self impact is lower than unconditionally .",
    "this is somewhat expected since order signs are positively autocorrelated and we exclude contributions where other trades have on average a positive contribution to impact .",
    "however the decrease in market impact is stronger for the cross - impact components , which are smaller by a factor of @xmath164 on average , whereas self - impact decreases only by a factor @xmath165 on average .",
    "we conclude therefore that both an autocorrelation of orders across assets as well as quote revisions play a role in forming cross - impact . in the next section",
    "we will take into account the ( cross- ) autocorrelation of the order sign when we estimate the shape of the decay of market impact .      to estimate the empirically observed decay function we employ a multivariate version of the transient impact model of @xcite and similar to @xcite .",
    "while the advantage of the model lies in the fully non - parametric estimation of the kernel that we obtain , the tim is typically estimated in event time which is asset - specific .",
    "previous approaches avoid potential pitfalls by estimating the propagator in calendar time and binning trades .",
    "the estimation then is sensitive to the bin width . a small bin - width as 1 second in @xcite introduces problems in the treatment of bins without trading activity , while a large bin width as 5 minutes in @xcite is too coarse to observe effects of single transactions .",
    "the main difference of our estimation is that we estimate the propagator in a combined market order time .",
    "specifically our combined trade time is defined to advance by one unit for any unique timestamp at which there is at least one trade recorded , irrespective of the asset(s ) . of trades",

    "this inefficiency could be exploited by e.g. a simple buy - hold - sell strategy .",
    "however here the expected gain is on the order of @xmath205 basis points while spread costs are @xmath206 basis points so that such a strategy would not be profitable .",
    "further we observe that self- and cross - impact decay rather slowly with average self - impact reaching its initial level after @xmath207 transactions , corresponding to @xmath204 minutes of physical time and cross - impact taking even longer .",
