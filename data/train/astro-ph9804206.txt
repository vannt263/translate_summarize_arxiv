    "the effect of cluster environment on the star formation properties of galaxies has long been a matter of debate .",
    "while some studies have suggested a lower star formation rate for cluster spirals as compared to the field ( e.g. ) , other work has suggested a similar or enhanced rate , particularly for early - type spirals(e.g . ) . with the discovery that in distant rich clusters there is a high fraction of blue , star - forming galaxies , often with unusual morphology suggestive of mergers and tidal interactions ( e.g. ) ,",
    "there is renewed interest in tidally - induced star formation by mergers and interactions in nearby clusters . in order to address these issues , moss , whittle and co -",
    "authors have completed an objective - prism survey of eight nearby clusters of galaxies to detect global emission as an indicator of the current rate of massive star formation .",

    "we have extended this survey to a ninth cluster , the hydra i cluster , abell 1060 .",
    "abell 1060 is one of the nearest of the abell clusters , at a redshift of @xmath10.01 , and is the nearest large cluster beyond the virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "it has a high spiral fraction ( e.g. ) and is a relatively poor cluster , with a low density intracluster medium @xcite and low x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "since it is the nearest of the clusters surveyed by us so far , it can be surveyed to a fainter limit in absolute magnitude .",
    "however , its proximity means that it has a large projected diameter on the sky , with one abell radius , ( where @xmath2 is defined in terms of the hubble constant @xmath3 ) . whereas other clusters were surveyed in a region of radius 1.5 @xmath4 , the photographic plate size restricted survey of abell 1060 to a region of radius somewhat less than one abell radius ( see  [ platty ] ) .",

    "as expected , only a small percentage of early type galaxies were detected in emission .",
    "previous work @xcite has shown the usefulness of a distinction between _ diffuse _ emission described by the concentration classes d ( diffuse ) and vd ( very diffuse ) , and _ compact _ emission described by the other three classes vc ( very concentrated ) , c ( concentrated ) , and n ( normal ) .",

    "a detailed comparison between the star formation rates of cluster galaxies in abell 1060 and corresponding rates for field galaxies is not possible due both to the small sample of detected emission - line galaxies and incomplete measurements of h@xmath0 equivalent widths .",
    "nevertheless it may be noted that a significant fraction of the detected cluster emission - line galaxies are early - type spirals which may be surprising in view of the detection limit of the survey technique of @xmath33 20  ( see mwi ) , and the expectation that h@xmath0 equivalent widths for galaxies of types sab and earlier in the field are less than 20  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the three galaxies eso 501-g17 , eso 501-g45 , and r89 281 , typed sa or earlier by r89 and , and known cluster members , have measured equivalent widths greater than 20 , and can therefore be considered to have unusually high star formation rates .",
    "the cluster elliptical eso 436-ig42 also has a very high equivalent width of 96(see  [ indiv ] ) .",

    "two redshifts have been determined for the pair from optical and 21 cm line measurements of 2851 and .",

    "a two - plate redshift measurement was not possible .",
    "however , a less accurate estimate can be made using a single plate , giving redshifts of for eso 501-ig61 and for eso 501-g62 , with an adopted uncertainty of ( mwi ) .",
    "this is accurate enough to identify eso 501-ig61 as a possible cluster member and eso 501-g62 as a non - member , and to confirm that they are not an interacting pair as might otherwise be inferred from their close separation .",

    "finally , although the small sample of detected cluster elgs in abell 1060 precludes a detailed comparison of star formation rates between these cluster galaxies and corresponding types in the field , it is to be noted that at least three early - type cluster spirals ( types s0 to sa ) and an elliptical have global h@xmath0 equivalent widths greater than 20  , which would be anomalously high for these galaxy types in the field .",
