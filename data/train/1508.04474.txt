    "the work presented in this paper is motivated by the efforts to develop the liquid metal battery , a device for short - term stationary energy storage .",
    "small laboratory prototypes have already been shown to work and demonstrated potential for higher efficiency and longer operational life than the traditional solid - electrode batteries ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the key question now appears to be whether larger , more efficient , and commercially viable devices based on the same principle can be designed .     driven by electrons and positive ions of metal is imposed .",
    "it generates a purely or approximately azimuthal magnetic field ( not shown ) .",
    "other components of the magnetic field can be generated by electrical currents in neighboring batteries and supply lines.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    a simplified scheme of the battery is shown in fig .",
    "it is a vessel filled with three liquid layers : liquid anode made of a light metal ( e.g. , na , li , or mg ) at the top , layer of a molten salt electrolyte in the middle , and liquid cathode containing a mixture of a heavy metal ( e.g. , bi , sb , or pbsb ) and the compound between the heavy and light metals at the bottom . the electrolyte is chosen so that it is immiscible with the liquids on either side and conductive to the positive ions of the light metal .",
    "the system is stably stratified , with the density of the light metal being about two times smaller than the density of the electrolyte and many times smaller than the density of the heavy metal .",
    "the top and bottom walls of the vessel serve as current collectors , while the sidewalls are electrically insulating .",
    "the electric energy stored in the battery is the difference in the gibbs free energy between the light metal in its free state and in compound with the heavy metal .",
    "the processes of charging or discharging correspond to , respectively , the electrochemical reduction of the light metal from the compound and forming the compound .",
    "the reactions occur in liquid state , at the interfaces between the electrolyte and the metal , and in the presence of strong ( about 1 a/@xmath0 ) electrical currents flowing in the vertical direction .",
    "an inspection of the scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] suggests that the operation of a large - scale battery will differ significantly from that of a small laboratory prototype .",
    "the reason is the hydrodynamic instabilities which will appear and become stronger at larger size .",
    "the result of the instabilities will be fluid flows in all the three layers with the potential implications for the battery operation that can be both positive ( enhanced mixing of reactants ) and negative ( spatial and temporal non - uniformity of reaction rates and , in the worst case , deformation of the interfaces so strong that it leads to rupture of the electrolyte layer and disruption of the operation ) .",
    "this issue has been a subject of close attention recently .",
    "several mechanisms of the instability have been identified , such as the tayler instability ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , electrovortex instability @xcite , and thermal convection caused by bottom heating @xcite or internal joule heating of the electrolyte @xcite .",
    "it has been confirmed that the instabilities are active in batteries of even modest size ( of radius about 20 cm in the case of tayler instability and as small as a few cm in the case of internal heating convection ) .",
    "further investigations are needed to fully understand the instabilities and reveal their effect on the battery s operation .    yet",
    "another likely instability mechanism , which has not been considered before , is addressed in this paper .",
    "it has magneto - electro - hydrodynamic nature and is related to the fact that , during the charging or discharging processes , strong current passes through liquid layers of vastly different electric conductivities .",
    "the conductivity @xmath1 of the electrolyte is about four orders of magnitude lower than the conductivities @xmath2 and @xmath3 of both metals .",
    "this means that even a small deformation of the electrolyte - metal interface , i.e. , a small variation the local thickness of the electrolyte causes a strong variation of the local resistance and , thus , significant changes in the distribution of the electric currents within the battery . in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility that the lorentz forces resulting from the interaction of the electric current perturbations and the magnetic field act on the liquids in such a way that the deformation of the interface is enhanced .    on the level of basic physics",
    ", the concept of such an instability is not new .",
    "a similar mechanism has been found in the hall - hroult aluminum reduction cells , where it is called the ` metal pad instability ' .",
    "a reduction cell is a horizontally large ( about 3 by 10 m ) and shallow ( about 20 - 40 cm ) rectangular bath filled with molten aluminum at the bottom and molten salt electrolyte with aluminum oxide dissolved in it at the top .",
    "the ratio of electric conductivities between the metal and the electrolyte is about the same as in liquid metal batteries .",
    "electric current of density about 0.1 a/@xmath0 flows predominantly vertically through the two layers causing the desired effect of electrochemical reduction of aluminum from its oxide .    for many decades",
    ", the aluminum industry faced the major problem of the metal pad instability that developed in the form of growing sloshing waves at the aluminum - electrolyte interface when the distance between the top electrode and the interface was too small or the current density was too high .",
    "if allowed to evolve , the instability led to short circuit between the aluminum and the top electrode , in which case the operation of the cell had to be stopped . keeping the thickness of the electrolyte layer above the threshold resolved the problem , but at the cost of substantial energy losses to the waste joule heating of the electrolyte .",
    "remarkably , proneness to the instability varied among the cells of the same design depending on their location in an aluminum smelting plant .",
    "the situation improved drastically when it was understood that the instability was caused by the interaction between the horizontal currents appearing in the aluminum layer in the result of the interface deformation and the vertical component of the magnetic field created by the external current supply lines @xcite .",
    "upon development of effective modeling tools ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and applying them to designing new and retrofitting existing supply lines , the problem was largely solved .    we should stress that the analogy between an aluminum reduction cell and a liquid metal battery is far from complete .",
    "not only a battery has three layers instead of two , its aspect ratio , for the laboratory prototypes developed so far , is not small ( in fact , the optimal geometry of a liquid metal battery is yet to be determined ) .",
    "furthermore , the typical current density is much higher ( about 1 a/@xmath0 ) in a battery .",
    "the analogy is , therefore , just a starting point of our analysis . nevertheless , for the absence of a better name",
    ", we will use the term ` metal pad instability ' for the instability mechanisms considered in this paper .",
    "the analysis follows the approach , in which one instability mechanism is analyzed separately from the others ( similar approaches were recently used for the tayler @xcite and convection @xcite instabilities ) .",
    "we also apply a drastic simplification replacing the liquid metal layers and by slabs of solid metals suspended above and below a liquid layer of a poorly conducting electrolyte .",
    "the large - scale sloshing motions of the metal layers ( for example , the gravitational waves ) are represented by the motions of the slabs , which we model as two - dimensional oscillations of mechanical pendula modified and coupled to each other by the electromagnetic forces .",
    "the approach is similar to that successfully applied to the metal pad instability in the aluminum reduction cells in @xcite .",
    "we go further than simply modifying the results of @xcite to the case of a three - layer system",
    ". a broader range of possible interactions between the currents caused by the interface deformation and the imposed magnetic fields is considered .",
    ", and the constant vertical current @xmath4 flows through the system .",
    "motion of the slabs perturbs the thickness by @xmath5 and causes perturbations of electric current @xmath6 .",
    "pictures illustrate , schematically and in an exaggerating way , the results of the tilting of the slabs around the @xmath7-axis _ ( a ) _ and @xmath8-axis ( _ b_).,scaledwidth=90.0% ]      the system analyzed in this work is shown schematically in fig .",
    "the metal layers of a battery are represented by solid metal slabs and rigidly attached to weightless rigid struts pivoted at the top .",
    "the free oscillations of the slabs around the two horizontal axes passing through the pivot imitate the sloshing motion of the liquid layers .",
    "the slabs are separated from each other by a layer of a poorly conducting electrolyte .",
    "strong electric current of density @xmath9 flows through the system .",
    "there is also the magnetic field of induction @xmath10 , which combines the field induced by @xmath9 and the field induced by currents in external supply lines and neighboring batteries .    in the rest of the paper , symbols without superscripts",
    "are understood as related to both pendula .",
    "to indicate , where necessary , the properties and variables related to a specific pendulum , superscripts a or b are used .    in the unperturbed state ,",
    "the slabs surfaces are horizontal , the thickness of the electrolyte layer is constant @xmath11 , and the electric current is uniform and purely vertical : @xmath12 ( for consistency , we will always consider a battery in the process of being charged , but the derivations and results are equally valid for a discharging battery with @xmath13 ) . when any of the slabs is tilted , the local thickness and , thus , local resistance of the electrolyte changes , and the current perturbations @xmath14 appear in the slabs and the electrolyte .",
    "their interaction with the magnetic field creates lorentz forces that modify the oscillations of the slabs , making them coupled with each other s and different from the purely gravitational oscillations .",
    "the hypothesis we explore here is that this effect may be a source of an instability .",
    "the replacement of liquid metal layers by solid slabs is the replacement of a system with infinitely many degrees of freedom by a system with just four such degrees .",
    "this can be considered as a low - mode approach , in which the key physical mechanism , namely the coupling between the deformation of interfaces and the electromagnetic forces , is retained , and the large - scale dynamics of the system is analyzed .",
    "we assume that the electric conductivities of the electrolyte and metal slabs satisfy @xmath15 the electrolyte layer is assumed shallow , with its thickness much smaller than the typical horizontal size of the slabs @xmath16 the perturbation of the local thickness of the electrolyte layer @xmath5 satisfies @xmath17    the first - order approximation in terms of the perturbation amplitude and of the ratio @xmath18 is used .",
    "perturbations of the magnetic field induced by the current perturbations @xmath6 are assumed much weaker than the base magnetic field @xmath10 and neglected in the analysis .",
    "the diffusion effects , such as the viscous friction and joule heat , as well as the pressure forces arising in the electrolyte are also neglected .",
    "finally , we assume that for each pendulum the distance between the pivot and the center of mass is equal to @xmath11 .      for each slab",
    ", we will use the local cartesian coordinate system rigidly attached to it and having the origin at the center of mass . the @xmath19-axis",
    "is directed upwards along the strut , while the horizontal axes are along the main axes of inertia .",
    "the motion is described by the angular momentum equations for rotations around the horizontal axes passing through the pivot and parallel to @xmath8 and @xmath7 at the moment when the slab is in the bottommost position : @xmath20 here , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the angles of rotation ( see fig .",

    "the variation of the electrolyte thickness causes variation of its local electrical resistivity and , thus , perturbations of electric currents . to evaluate them",

    "the derivation is first conducted for the bottom slab .",
    "we employ the fact that , since the electric conductivity is high , the current perturbations can be assumed to form completely closed loops within the slabs .",

    "it also depends on the horizontal shape of the battery .",
    "a battery of square cross - section @xmath104 and with @xmath84 has @xmath105 and , so , is always unstable ( the same conclusion can be easily shown as valid for a cylindrical battery ) . in general , we expect that , among the batteries with given @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the square and cylindrical ones would be most prone to the instability .",
    "the critical values of @xmath106 and @xmath107 would increase with increasing difference between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "an essential difference between the instabilities in the aluminum reduction cell and the battery is manifested by the combination of @xmath106 and @xmath107 appearing in ( [ crit3 ] ) in place of just one such parameter .",

    "liquid metal batteries are different from aluminum reduction cells in many respects other than the presence of the top metal layer . in particular",
    ", the density of the base electric current @xmath4 is about an order of magnitude higher , and the ratio between the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the metal layers is not necessarily small .",
    "this alters the electromagnetic interactions and may activate new mechanisms of instability . in this section ,",

    "the effect of the vertical current perturbations is weaker and mixed : destabilizing for the slab and stabilizing for the slab .",
    "the predictions made in this paper are , strictly speaking , valid only in the framework of our mechanical model . at the same time",
    ", they are expected to be qualitatively applicable to operation of real batteries .",
    "this includes the principal physical mechanisms of the instabilities , the form of the control parameters ( [ epsa ] ) ( [ c2par1 ] ) , and ( [ c2par2 ] ) , and , possibly , the order of magnitude of the critical values of these parameters . the results of this paper can serve as a stating point for future work based on more realistic models .    by analogy with the aluminum reduction cells , we predict that the instability of the type described in section [ sec : case1 ] will occur in real batteries if sufficiently strong vertical magnetic fields are allowed . the batteries of square or round horizontal cross - section will be particularly unstable .",
    "a more specific prediction requires detailed analysis of specific geometries .",
    "we can list three factors that make the instability in the batteries more likely than in the reduction cells .",
    "one is the about an order of magnitude higher density of the base electric current @xmath4 .",
    "another is the presence of the top metal layer , which plays a destabilizing role , and whose parameter @xmath106 is particularly large because of the low density @xmath137 .",
    "finally , thin ( a few mm ) electrolyte layers are used in the current battery prototypes .",
    "this can be compared with the thickness about 4 cm in modern reduction cells .    at the same time , the horizontal dimensions of a battery are unlikely to be as larger ( several meters ) as in typical reduction cells .",
    "finally , the instability can be postponed or even completely avoided by optimizing the current supply lines so that there is no significant vertical magnetic field .",
    "we have to be more careful while making predictions for the instability described in section [ sec : case2 ] . on one hand",
    ", it appears to be more dangerous than the instability of the first type , since the azimuthal magnetic field ( [ magaz ] ) can not be ` optimized away ' . on the other hand , existence of such an instability in a real battery",
    "yet needs to be confirmed .    at this point",
    ", we assume that the instability of the second type appears in real batteries and make preliminary estimates of the size , at which this would happen . since @xmath138 , and @xmath137 is about an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath139",
    ", @xmath106 is much larger than the other parameters in ( [ c2crit ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we approximate the instability criterion as @xmath140 . using @xmath141 a m@xmath142 and @xmath143 kg m@xmath144 ( approximate value for liquid lithium at 720 k )",
    ", we find the critical values of radius , above which the battery is unstable , shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
