    "in this report i will be concerned mainly with the frequentist ( classical ) theory of statistical inference , but i think that it is interesting and useful that i express my opinion on the war between frequentists and bayesians . to the question",
    "`` are you frequentist or bayesian '' ?",
    "i answer    `` i like statistics . ''",
    "i think that if one likes statistics , one can appreciate the beauty of both frequentist and bayesian theories and the subtleties involved in their formulation and application .",
    "i think that both approaches are valid from a statistical as well as physical point of view .",
    "their difference arises from different definitions of probability and their results answer different statistical questions .",
    "one can like more one of the two theories , but i think that it is unreasonable to claim that only one of them is correct , as some partisans of that theory claim .",
    "these partisans often produce examples in which the other approach is shown to yield misleading or paradoxical results .",
    "i think that each theory should be appreciated and used in its limited range of validity , in order to answer the appropriate questions .",
    "finding some example in which one approach fails does not disprove its correctness in many other cases that lie in its range of validity .",
    "my impression is that the bayesian theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) has a wider range of validity because it can be applied to cases in which the experiment can be done only once or a few times ( for example , our thoughts in everyday decisions and judgments seem to follow an approximate bayesian method ) . in these cases",
    "the bayesian definition of probability as _ degree of believe _ seems to me the only one that makes sense and is able to provide meaningful results .",
    "let me remind that since galileo an accepted basis of scientific research is the _ repeatability of experiments_. this assumption justifies the frequentist definition of probability as ratio of the number of positive cases and total number of trials in a large ensemble .",
    "the concept of _ coverage _ follows immediately : a @xmath0 _ confidence interval _ for a physical quantity @xmath1 is an interval that contains ( covers ) the unknown true value of that quantity with a frequentist probability @xmath2 . in other words ,",
    "a @xmath0 confidence interval for @xmath1 belongs to a set of confidence intervals that can be obtained with a large ensemble of experiments , @xmath0 of which contain the true value of @xmath1 .",
    "i think that in order to fully appreciate the meaning and usefulness of frequentist confidence intervals obtained with neyman s method @xcite , it is important to understand that the experiments in the ensemble do not need to be identical , as often stated , or even similar , but can be real , different experiments @xcite .",
    "one can understand this property in a simple way @xcite by considering , for example , two different experiments that measure the same physical quantity @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath0 classical confidence interval obtained from the results of each experiment belongs by construction to a set of confidence intervals which can be obtained with an ensemble of identical experiments and contain the true value of @xmath1 with probability @xmath2 .",
    "it is clear that the sum of these two sets of confidence intervals , containing the two confidence intervals obtained in the two different experiments , is still a set of confidence intervals that contain the true value of @xmath1 with probability @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , for the same reasons it is clear that _ the results of different experiments can also be analyzed with different frequentist methods _",
    "@xcite , _ i.e. _ methods with correct coverage but different prescriptions for the construction of the confidence belt .",
    "this for me is amazing and beautiful : _ whatever method you choose you get a result that can be compared meaningfully with the results obtained by different experiments using different methods _ !",
    "it is important to realize , however , that the choice of the frequentist method must be done independently of the knowledge of the data ( before looking at the data ) , otherwise the property of coverage is lost , as in the `` flip - flop '' example in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this property allow us to solve an apparent paradox that follows from the recent proliferation of proposed frequentist methods .",
    "this proliferation seems to introduce a large degree of subjectivity in the frequentist approach , supposed to be objective , due to the need to choose one specific prescription for the construction of the confidence belt , among several available with similar properties . from the property above , we see that whatever frequentist method one chooses , if implemented correctly , the resulting confidence interval can be compared statistically with the confidence intervals of other experiments obtained with other frequentist methods .",
    "therefore , _ the subjective choice of a specific frequentist method does not have any effect from a statistical point of view _ !",
    "then you should ask me :    why are you proposing a specific frequentist method ?",
    "the answer lies in _ physics _",
    ", not statistics .",
    "it is well known that the statistical analysis of the same data with different frequentist methods produce different confidence intervals .",
    "this difference is sometimes crucial for the physical interpretation of the result of the experiment ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the physical significance of the confidence intervals obtained with different frequentist methods is sometimes crucially different .",
    "in other words , _ the frequentist method suffers from a degree of subjectivity from a physical , not statistical , point of view_.",
    "the possibility to apply successfully frequentist statistics to problematic cases in frontier research has received a fundamental contribution with the proposal of the unified approach by feldman and cousins @xcite .",
    "the unified approach consists in a clever prescription for the construction of  a classical confidence belt which unifies the treatment of upper confidence limits for null results and two - sided confidence intervals for non - null results \" .    in the following",
    "i will consider the case of a poisson process with signal @xmath1 and known background @xmath3 .",
    "the probability to observe @xmath4 events is @xmath5    the unified approach is based on the construction of the acceptance intervals @xmath6 $ ] ordering the @xmath4 s through their rank given by the relative magnitude of the likelihood ratio @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath1 , @xmath9 \\ , .",
    "\\label{mu - best}\\ ] ] as a result of this construction the confidence intervals are two - sided ( _ i.e. _ @xmath10 $ ] with @xmath11 ) for @xmath12 , whereas for @xmath13 they are upper limits ( _ i.e. _ @xmath14 ) .    the fact that the confidence intervals are two - sided for @xmath12 can be understood by considering @xmath15 , that gives @xmath16 . in this case",
    "the likelihood ratio ( [ lr ] ) is given by @xmath17 - ( \\mu+b ) \\right\\ } \\stackrel{n\\to\\infty}{\\longrightarrow } 0 \\ , .",
    "\\label{lr-2}\\ ] ] this implies that the rank of high values of @xmath4 is very low and they are excluded form the confidence belt .",
    "therefore , the acceptance intervals @xmath6 $ ] are always bounded , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath18 is finite , and the confidence intervals are two - sided for @xmath12 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ualim ] , where the solid lines show the borders of the confidence belt for a background @xmath19 and a confidence level @xmath20 .",
    "the fact that the confidence intervals are upper limits for @xmath13 can be understood by considering @xmath21 , for which we have @xmath22 and the likelihood ratio that determines the ordering of the @xmath4 s in the acceptance intervals is given by @xmath23 considering now the acceptance interval for @xmath24 , we have @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , all @xmath21 for @xmath24 have highest rank and are guaranteed to lie in the confidence belt .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ualim ] , where the thick solid segment shows the @xmath21 part of the acceptance interval for @xmath26 , that must lie in the confidence belt . since @xmath1 is a continuous parameter , also for small values of @xmath1",
    "the @xmath21 have rank close to the highest one and lie in the confidence belt .",
    "indeed , for @xmath27 , the likelihood ratio ( [ lr ] ) increases for @xmath4 going form zero to the largest integer smaller or equal to @xmath3 and decreases for larger values of @xmath4 .",
    "hence , the largest integer @xmath28 such that @xmath29 has highest rank . if @xmath1 is sufficiently small all @xmath21 have rank close to maximum and are included in the confidence belt if the confidence level is large enough , @xmath30 .",
    "for example , @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the left edge of the confidence belt must change its slope for @xmath13 and intercept the @xmath1-axis at a positive value of @xmath1 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ualim ] . the value of @xmath1 at which the left edge of the confidence belt intercepts the @xmath1-axis , that corresponds to @xmath33 , depends on the value of the background @xmath3 and on the value of the confidence level @xmath2 .",
    "however is devoid of any practical interest .",
    "] , for small values of @xmath2 the unified approach gives zero - width confidence intervals for @xmath34 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ uabelt ] , where i have chosen @xmath19 and @xmath35 .",
    "one can see that the segment @xmath21 is enclosed in the confidence belt for @xmath26 , but for any value of @xmath27 the sum of the probabilities of the @xmath4 s close to @xmath36 is enough to reach the confidence level and low values of @xmath4 are not included in the confidence belt .",
    "hence , in this case the unified approach gives zero - width confidence intervals for @xmath37 .",
    "the unification of the treatments of upper confidence limits for null results and two - sided confidence intervals for non - null results obtained with the unified approach is wonderful , but it has been noticed that the upper limits obtained with the unified approach for @xmath38 are too stringent ( meaningless ) from a physical point of view @xcite . in other words , although these limits are statistically correct from a frequentist point of view , they can not be taken as reliable upper bounds to be used in physical applications .",
    "this problem is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ higback]a , where i plotted the 90% cl upper limit @xmath39 as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath40 . the solid part of each line shows where @xmath41 .",
    "one can see that for a given @xmath4 , @xmath39 decreases rather steeply when @xmath3 is increased , until a minimum value close to one is reached .",
    "the curves have jumps because @xmath4 is an integer and generally the desired confidence level can not be obtained exactly , but with some unavoidable overcoverage .",
    "let me emphasize that the problem of obtaining too stringent upper limits for @xmath38 is very serious for a scientist that wants to obtain reliable information from experiment and use this information for other purposes ( as input for a theory or another experiment ) . in the past , researchers bearing the same physical point of view refrained to report empty confidence intervals or very stringent upper limits when @xmath38 was measured .",
    "these confidence intervals are correct from a statistical point of view , but useless from a physical point of view .",
    "furthermore , the same reasoning lead to prefer the unified approach to central confidence intervals or upper limits , because the non - empty confidence interval obtained when @xmath38 is measured is certainly more significant , from a physical point of view , than an empty one , although they are statistically equivalent , as shown in section  [ significance ] .",
    "in the unified approach @xmath8 is positive and equal to zero for @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath8 is forced to be always bigger than zero , the @xmath4 s smaller than @xmath3 have rank higher than in the unified approach . as a consequence , the decrease of the upper limit @xmath39 as @xmath3 increases is weakened .",
    "this is illustrated by a _",
    "`` brutally modified unified approach '' _ ( bmua ) in which we take @xmath42 \\ , , \\label{mu - best - bmua}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is a positive real number .    in fig .",
    "[ aubelt ] i plotted the confidence belts for @xmath44 ( solid lines ) , that corresponds to the unified approach , @xmath45 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath46 ( dotted lines ) , for @xmath47 . one can see that in the bmua the upper limits of the confidence intervals are considerably higher than in the unified approach . the behavior of @xmath39 as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath48 is shown in fig .",
    "[ auhigback ] , from which it is clear that the decrease of @xmath39 when @xmath3 increases is much weaker in the bmua ( dashed and dotted lines ) than in the unified approach ( solid line ) and it is almost absent for @xmath49 .",

    "the bmua is a statistically correct frequentist method and coverage is satisfied .",
    "2 .   in the bmua one obtains upper limits for @xmath13 and central confidence intervals for @xmath12 , as in the unified approach we have @xmath50 and the likelihood ratio ( [ lr ] ) becomes @xmath51 for @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 and @xmath54 decreases with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "let us consider now @xmath55 , for which @xmath16 and the likelihood ratio ( [ lr ] ) is given by the expression in eq .",
    "( [ lr-2 ] ) .",
    "this expression has a maximum for @xmath4 equal to one of the two integers closest to @xmath36 . for @xmath52 ,",
    "this integer is the first one in the considered range ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently low values of @xmath1 , @xmath52 , the likelihood ratio ( [ lr ] ) decreases monotonically as @xmath4 increases . in this case ,",
    "low values of @xmath4 have highest ranks and are guaranteed to lie in the confidence belt and the left edge of the confidence belt must change its slope for @xmath56 and intercept the @xmath1-axis at a positive value of @xmath1 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ aubelt ] . ] .",
    "the bmua method is not general ( although it can be extended in an obvious way at least to the case of a gaussian variable with a physical boundary ) .",
    "_ i am not proposing the bmua _ !",

    "[ aubelt ] , the right edge of the confidence belt in the bmua is not very different from the one in the unified approach .",
    "this is due to the fact that adding small values of @xmath4 with low probability to the acceptance intervals has little effect .",
