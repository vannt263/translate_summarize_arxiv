    "current astrophysical observations predict the existence of further fluids , in addition to the standard pressureless matter terms , which allow the universe to undergo a positive late time acceleration @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the physical origin of such exotic fluids is a big puzzle in modern cosmology @xcite .",
    "particularly , an intense debate arose in order to understand which kind of fluid can be responsible for this apparent cosmic speed up @xcite .",
    "even though its physical nature is completely unclear , it is well understood that it shows a negative equation of state ( eos ) @xcite .",
    "such an eos is able to accelerate the universe because it provides an antigravitational effect , which counterbalances the attraction of gravity acting on standard matter @xcite .",
    "the fluid , which drives the observed acceleration , is usually referred to as dark energy ( de ) and fills more than the 70@xmath2 of the whole universe energy budget @xcite .",
    "one of the most viable choices for de is to assume the existence of a vacuum energy cosmological constant @xmath1 @xcite . the corresponding @xmath1cdm model , is characterized by the presence of baryon and cold dark matter components intertwined with the cosmological constant density , @xmath3 , which actually represents the natural candidate for depicting the de effects @xcite .",
    "the model excellently passes all the experimental tests and entered the modern cosmological convictions , becoming the new standard cosmological model .",
    "even though @xmath1cdm seems to be experimentally favorite in explaining the universe dynamics , it is plagued by two profound issues , i.e. the problems of coincidence and fine - tuning ( for further details see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , other alternative explanations have been carried on during the last decades @xcite .",
    "the common property of all these approaches is that the de effects can be associated to an evolving eos @xcite ; among the wide number of different paradigms , a relevant role is played by theories that claim to extend general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the underlying philosophy of extended theories of gravity is that gr should be seen as a particular case of a more general effective theory coming from fundamental principles @xcite .",
    "the basic idea lies on the fact that the standard einstein - hilbert action is modified by additional degrees of freedom , spanning from further curvature invariant corrections , to scalar fields and lorentz violating terms .    here ,",
    "we limit our attention to investigate the so called @xmath0 theories , which represent a class of models that take into account the effects due to the torsion @xcite .",
    "the main advance of @xmath0 gravity deals with the fact that the ricci scalar curvature , @xmath4 , is assumed to be @xmath5 . under this hypothesis ,",
    "the @xmath0 models can be seen as extensions of the so - called teleparallel gravity @xcite .",
    "the property of a vanishing @xmath6 is motivated by the theoretical inflationary phases in the early stages of the universe evolution .",
    "thus , one can extend the lagrangian density by adding a torsion function , i.e. @xmath0 .    to infer the cosmological equations , we can consider an orthonormal basis @xmath7 for the tangent space at each point @xmath8 on a generic manifold , with @xmath9 running over @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the metric tensor is obtained from the dual basis @xmath11 as @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the coordinate indices on the manifold running over @xmath10 and @xmath15 are the coordinates of the dual basis with respect to a coordinate basis on the cotangent space .",
    "it is prominent to redefine the torsion @xmath16 in terms of the quoted quantities , obtaining    @xmath17    and the so - called contorsion @xmath18 , that reads    @xmath19    for the sake of simplicity , one can write down    @xmath20    that , together with eq .",
    "( @xmath21 ) , allows to get the torsion scalar @xmath22 as    @xmath23    finally , the modified teleparallel action of a generic @xmath0 model with the matter lagrangian @xmath24 is    @xmath25\\ , , \\label{eq : ixa-2.6}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 . by varying eq .",
    "( @xmath27 ) with respect to the vierbein vector field @xmath28 , we get the gravitational field equations    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the energy - momentum tensor , including all the possible fluids , such as matter , radiation , and so on . from eq .",
    "( @xmath31 ) , it is easy to note that the problem of determining the de fluid is switched to find out a suitable form for @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , a compelling observational challenge is to reconstruct the cosmological bounds on @xmath0 and its derivatives , without postulating any @xmath0 _ a priori_. this permits to feature the universe evolution , without imposing any cosmological model from the beginning .",
    "one of the most remarkable approaches , lying on being model independent , is represented by _",
    "cosmography _ @xcite .",
    "cosmography was initially proposed in order to relate the taylor expansion of the luminosity distance in terms of the acceleration parameter .",
    "recently it raised much interest to constrain the dynamics of the universe .",
    "the only remarkable assumption is the validity of the cosmological principle and the use of the corresponding friedmann - robertson - walker metric ( frw ) .",
    "thus , cosmography allows us to infer how much de or alternative components are requested in order to obtain the late time acceleration of the universe . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the idea of cosmography is to expand the physical observables , such as the cosmological distances , the hubble parameter , the pressure and so forth , into a taylor series around the epoch @xmath32 .",
    "afterwards , one can relate the model free parameters which are under exam directly to such observables .",
    "in doing so , it is straightforward to show which models are compatible with the kinematics of the universe and which ones should be discarded as a consequence of not satisfying the basic demands of cosmography @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive general constraints on @xmath0 and its derivatives at our time in terms of the observable cosmographic quantities .",
    "this procedure extends the work in @xcite by inverting the equations relating the @xmath0 taylor series to the cosmographic parameters , and obtaining more accurate constraints on @xmath0 models .",
    "this is due to the fact that we minimize the error propagation in the fitting procedure , by relating _",
    "directly _ the luminosity distance in terms of the @xmath0 taylor series .",
    "we proceed with a monte carlo analysis , performed by modifying the available cosmomc code .",
    "the corresponding experimental limits on the observable @xmath0 allow us to propose an analytic function for @xmath0 , satisfying the cosmographic requirements ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ cosmography ] we evaluate the cosmographic quantities of interest and relate them in terms of @xmath0 quantities . in sec .",
    "[ constraints ] , we discuss the experimental procedure used to fix constraints on @xmath0 and its derivatives at @xmath32 and present possible examples of @xmath0 gravity compatible with our results . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we draw conclusions and discuss the results . the detailed expressions for the luminosity distance in terms of @xmath0 function are given in the appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "let us discuss now the cosmographic analysis that we are going to perform for @xmath0 gravity .",
    "first of all it is important to stress that cosmography very marginally depends on the choice of a given cosmological model , because the only stringent assumption is that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "this is alternative to almost all the cosmological tests which basically fix priors and constraints for the model under consideration .",
    "this fact can give rise to severe degeneracy problems and does not allow to infer which model is really favored .",
    "cosmography , on the contrary , alleviates degeneracy , because it bounds only cosmological quantities which do not strictly depend on a model .",
    "thus , by postulating the validity of the cosmological principle , we consider the frw metric , i.e. @xmath33 where we assume hereafter a spatially flat universe ( @xmath34 ) , with @xmath35 and expand the scale factor @xmath36 in a taylor series around the present epoch @xmath37 . from the expansion of the scale factor",
    ", we define the quantities @xmath38 which are , by construction , model independent quantities , and are referred to as the cosmographic set ( cs ) .",
    "they are known as the hubble rate ( @xmath39 ) , the acceleration parameter ( @xmath40 ) , the jerk parameter ( @xmath41 ) , the snap parameter ( @xmath42 ) .    here",
    ", we want to relate the cs to the derivatives of @xmath0 in order to set constraints on the model without any _ a priori _ assumption on the function @xmath0 . in order to perform this ,",
    "let us sketch the main steps that we are going to perform along this work .",
    "we will use the modified friedmann equations and the definition of the cs , to write @xmath0 and its derivatives with respect to @xmath22 at present time as functions of the cs .",
    "then , we will algebraically invert these relations and write the luminosity distance in terms of @xmath0 and its derivatives .",
    "once the luminosity distance is rewritten in terms of @xmath0 and its derivatives , it is possible to constrain such coefficients _ directly _ , without postulating any @xmath0 function _ a priori_. in addition , our procedure allows to alleviate the problem of the error propagation in the numerical analysis .    to derive the expressions for @xmath43 in terms of the cs introduced in ( [ pinza ] ) , let us start with the modified friedmann equations in the case of @xmath0 gravity , i.e.    @xmath44\\ , , \\label{eq1}\\\\ 2 \\dot{\\mathcal{h } } + 3\\mathcal{h}^2&= & - \\frac{1}{3 } ( p+p_{\\mathcal t } ) \\,,\\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the standard matter energy density @xmath45 and pressure @xmath46 have their torsion scalar counterpart @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49,\\ ] ] @xmath50-\\rho_{\\mathcal t}.\\ ] ] are the torsion contributions to the energy density and pressure .",
    "then , by using eqs .",
    "( [ rhot ] ) and ( [ pt ] ) , we can define the effective torsion equation of state as @xmath51 the quantities @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be related to the observed acceleration of the universe . here",
    "we assume to work in the so - called jordan frame , where the action ( [ eq : ixa-2.6 ] ) is not the usual hilbert - einstein action and standard fluid matter is minimally coupled to geometry .",
    "this choice can be justified as follows .    in our calculations , we prevent any measurement departure from changing frame because it is possible to demonstrate that , passing through different frames , the cosmographic series preserve its form @xcite . hence , no physical modifications are expected in transforming the system from the einstein frame to the jordan frame and vice - versa .",
    "particular attention has been devoted to the cosmographic series . in the case of modified gravity",
    ", the corresponding changes has been accounted and investigated in @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the problem has been considered in @xcite . by means of this equivalence , physics in both frames",
    "is identical .",
    "it implies that a system sets up in the jordan frame is solved in the einstein frame as long as it is transformed back to the jordan frame and vice versa .",
    "the corresponding invariance in form turns out to be evident by assuming @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the friedmann eqs([eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) . in particular differentiating the friedmann equations with respect to @xmath52 and using ( [ pinza ] ) , one can write @xmath53\\,,\\label{dddoth}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which represent the relations between @xmath43 and the cs .",

    "this procedure overcomes the systematical error propagation problems of recent works on cosmography and @xmath0 , in which one has to infer the cosmographic bounds once the values of the cs are known .",
    "our procedure allows to better constrain the dynamics and shows that small departures from @xmath1cdm seem to be consistent in the context of @xmath0 theories .",

    "we expect in future works to improve the present analysis , describing more accurately higher derivatives and giving more insights on the correct form of @xmath0 , through the use of different datasets and combining the results with the tests at larger redshift scales .",
    "however , some important remarks are necessary at this point in order to frame the results in a physical context . for example , we know that the space - time metric ( and in particular @xmath149 ) is not an observable , but , starting from it , we can derive quantities related to observables like @xmath150 or @xmath70 that can be connected to the matter - energy and the pressure by the field equations and experimentally deduced by the luminosity distance @xmath151 or other cosmological indicators .",
    "this situation is particularly delicate as soon as one consider alternative theories of gravity like @xmath152-gravity or scalar - tensor theories where one has to select the invariant physical quantities and determine how they behave under conformal and gauge transformations ( see @xcite for extended discussions on this topic ) . in particular , one can use conformal transformations to go from the jordan frame where matter is minimally coupled to the metric , to the einstein frame where the standard einstein - hilbert action is present , but the matter acquires extra non - minimal couplings .",
    "the conformally transformed metric is very different in the two frames ( in general , we have a bi - metric structure where a metric is defined in the einstein frame and the other is defined in the jordan frame ) , but they describe the same physical scenario , and the observable quantities , appropriately transformed , turn out to be the same . in the present case ,",
    "we have assumed , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ cosmography ] that we work in the @xmath153-frame ( the jordan frame ) . even though this would suggest to modify the cosmographic quantities , i.e. eqs .",
    "( [ pinza ] ) , to guarantee that the conformal transformations hold , it is possible to show that cosmography turns out to be independent in form under conformal transformations @xcite .",
    "this feature alleviates the _ measurement problem _ which could influence any analysis .",
    "in particular , it prevents measurement departures of cosmological quantities by different observers placed in separate spacetime regions . to account for such a property",
    ", one defines the expressions for @xmath47 and @xmath48 as in eqs.([rhot ] ) and ( [ pt ] ) , see also @xcite",
    ". the results in the einstein frame , where standard cosmographic series is evaluated , are restored by considering the further @xmath47 and @xmath48 terms in the cosmological friedmann eqs.([eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) . in other words , also if the cosmographic quantities appear to be the same , in form , in different frame , the further density and pressure terms make the difference and analogous results are found either in einstein or in jordan frame ( see the development in sec.[cosmography ] . )    as final remark , it is worth saying that cosmography can be a formidable tool to select physically viable models since its results can be easily translated in different frames . despite of this achievement , it is extremely difficult to extend the cosmography results at any redshift due to cosmic evolution and non - reliable data sets at any epoch .",
