    "observations of thermal dust emission from galactic structures , such as starless cores , filaments , and bubbles in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , can provide key information on the initial conditions for star formation .",
    "significant advances in the modelling of these structures have been made possible by the availability of submillimetre imaging data at multiple wavelengths , such as that provided by _",
    "@xcite and various ground - based telescopes .",
    "the data carry information on physical parameters such as the density and temperature structure of prestellar cores and their filamentary environments , as well as that of the turbulent medium from which those structures are believed to evolve .",
    "the parameter estimation typically involves the fitting of modified blackbody models to the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "this may carried out on a pixel - by - pixel basis so as to produce maps of integrated column density and mean line - of - sight dust temperature ( sometimes referred to as _ column _ temperature ) .    in the standard procedure",
    "( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the images at all wavelengths are first smoothed to a common spatial resolution which , in the case of _ herschel _ data , means the resolution at the longest wavelength , i.e. , 500 @xmath1 m .",
    "a variant of this technique @xcite uses spatial filtering to restore ( with the possible exception of the cooler structures ) the 250 @xmath1 m spatial resolution .",
    "three physical assumptions underlying these procedures are : ( i ) the dust along a given line of sight has uniform temperature , ( ii ) the ratio of gas to dust is uniform , and ( iii ) the dust opacity law is constant and represented by a power - law , @xmath2 , as a function of wavelength , @xmath3 , with @xmath4 normally being taken as 2 .",
    "the latter assumption may be relaxed by allowing @xmath4 to vary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although care must be exercised in order to avoid spurious correlations due to the degeneracy between dust temperature , @xmath5 , and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "since the structures of interest are , in general , not isothermal , assumption ( i ) is often a poor one .",
    "this is particularly true of structures such as prestellar cores , which have large temperature gradients .",
    "those gradients can have significant effects on parameter values estimated from sed fits .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that line - of - sight temperature variations can lead to underestimates in mass .",
    "also , @xcite found that the temperature variations result in poor fits of the peaks of seds to the models , and that temperature estimates based on simple sed fits can provide only upper limits to the coldest temperatures along the line - of - sight .    if observational images are available at several ( at least three ) wavelengths , there is information contained in the data which allows us to constrain the distribution of temperature on the line of sight .",
    "we accomplish this goal by using the set of observed images to produce an image cube consisting of a stack of 2d images of differential column - density , where each image in the stack represents the column - density at a different dust temperature .",
    "this is an application of the more generic  point process \" algorithm @xcite , and we therefore refer to the new procedure as _ point process mapping _ , or ppmap .",
    "a point process is defined as a random set of points in a suitably - defined state space .",
    "it provides a conceptual framework for representing an astrophysical system as a collection of primitive `` objects , '' each of which is characterised by a set of parameters .",
    "those parameters then constitute the axes of a ",
    "single - object state space \" , so that the system itself is represented by a distribution of points in such a space . in the present context , the system may be a filament , bubble , core , or molecular cloud , and the constituent  objects \" are small building blocks , each of unit column - density and uniform temperature .",
    "each such object is then characterised by three parameters : 2d position projected onto the plane of the sky @xmath6 , and dust temperature @xmath7 ; it can thus be represented as a point in a three - dimensional state space .",
    "we divide the state space into a rectangular grid of @xmath8 cells corresponding to the total number of states ; the column - density distribution as a function of position and temperature is then defined by the set of occupation numbers of those cells , represented by vector @xmath9 which is referred to as the  state \" of the system .",
    "we assume that the astrophysical structure is optically thin to the radiation emitted by dust at all observed wavelengths .",
    "consequently the images are the superposition of the instrumental responses to all of the individual component objects , whose number is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "each object is defined to have unit column - density and a spatial profile corresponding to a circular gaussian whose full width at half maximum corresponds to 2 pixels in the positional grid .",
    "the measurement model can then be expressed as : @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the measurement vector whose @xmath13 component represents the pixel value at location @xmath14 in the observed image at wavelength @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is the measurement noise , assumed to be a gaussian random process with covariance @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is the system response matrix whose @xmath19 element expresses the response of the @xmath13 measurement to an object which occupies the @xmath20 cell in the state space , corresponding to spatial location @xmath21 and dust temperature @xmath22 ; it is given by @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the convolution of the point spread function ( psf ) at wavelength @xmath3 with the profile of an individual object ; @xmath25 is a possible colour correction to the model fluxes due the finite bandwidth of the observations ; @xmath26 is the planck function ; @xmath27 is the solid angle subtended by the @xmath13 pixel and @xmath28 is the dust opacity law .",
    "we could use any appropriate functional form for the latter , but for present purposes we adopt a simple power law with a constant index in the present case is motivated by the difficulty of constraining the opacity law with the limited coverage of long wavelengths in the _ herschel _ data set .",

    "the estimation is based on minimising the mean square error , so that the optimal estimate is then the _ a posteriori _ average value of @xmath34 , given by : @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is a 3-dimensional vector representing the coordinates @xmath49 of the @xmath20 cell in state space .",
    "the conditional probability , @xmath50 , is given by bayes rule , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is given by ( [ eq3 ] ) , @xmath53 serves as a normalisation factor , @xmath54 and @xmath55 denotes the transpose .",
    "we refer to @xmath56 as a density since it represents the average local density of occupied cells in the state space of position and temperature .",
    "its estimation is a generic problem in statistical mechanics , and its solution has been discussed previously in connection with acoustical imaging @xcite , target tracking @xcite , and the detection of planets using interferometric data @xcite .",
    "we use a stepwise approach in which we start by artificially increasing the measurement noise to the point at which the measurements contribute essentially no information ; the optimal solution is then simply the _ a priori _ mean density which is flat everywhere . we then gradually decrease the noise back down to the true value , updating @xmath56 at each step .",
    "the process can be regarded as a time sequence of noisy measurements whose cumulative effect is to build the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) back up to the correct value .",
    "the  time \" corresponds to a progress variable , @xmath57 , representing the degree of conditioning on the data , and its value increases from 0 to 1 during the estimation process . on this basis",
    "we rewrite our measurement model as @xmath58 where @xmath59 represents the artificially increased measurement noise , assumed to be uncorrelated between  time \" samples , i.e. @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an appropriately scaled version of @xmath62 .    the solution procedure is obtained from a hierarchy of integro - differential equations involving densities of all orders .",
    "fortunately , the hierarchy can be truncated , to good approximation , at the first member .",
    "we then obtain @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the conditioning factor , given by @xmath65 and @xmath66 represents a vector formed from the diagonal elements of @xmath67 .",

    "values in the range 0.10.01 typically suffice .",
    "provided @xmath39 ( or equivalently , @xmath42 ) has been appropriately chosen , the final number of representative objects ( equal to @xmath78 ) should correspond approximately to @xmath42 .",

    "table 1 presents a summary of the results obtained in the testing of ppmap on synthetic data for both models , i.e. , the prestellar core and fractal turbulent cloud .",
    "wherever possible it includes a comparison with results obtained using the standard techniques for column density mapping . some conclusions which can be drawn are :    1 .   for both the prestellar core and fractal cloud , ppmap yielded peak column densities , total masses and minimum dust temperatures close to the true values , while conventional techniques of column density mapping gave underestimates for peak column density and total mass , and overestimates for the minimum temperature .",
    "the apportioning of mass between the different temperature intervals was more accurate in the case of the prestellar core than for the fractal cloud , the median values of fractional error being 15% and 55% , respectively .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     with regard to item ( i )",
    ", the superior performance of ppmap can be attributed to the fact that it takes full account of line - of - sight temperature variations . regarding ( ii ) it is evident that , for both models , the mass errors for individual temperatures are much larger than the error in total mass , and this reflects the high degree of correlation between the errors . in all cases the mass errors are consistent with the expected uncertainties which , for the fractal cloud are @xmath111 at temperatures in the range 714 k , decreasing to @xmath112 at 25 k. as to the question of why the errors are significantly larger for the fractal cloud than for the prestellar core , the difference probably reflects the information content of the observations relative to the complexity of either model . in particular , table 1 shows that the prestellar core model has significant mass for only 6 temperatures , whereas the fractal cloud model has significant values for 10 temperatures .",
    "the 5 observational wavelengths ( in conjunction with prior information ) are apparently sufficient to constrain the 6 temperatures of the prestellar core but insufficient to constrain the 10 temperatures of the fractal cloud . in the latter case",
    "there is some degeneracy in the tradeoff of differential column density between neighbouring temperatures .",
    "when understood in these terms , the difference between the estimated and true values of fractal cloud mass at different temperatures is not as alarming as the 55% error would suggest , since closer inspection shows that the only significant difference is that the peak of the distribution is pushed upwards by @xmath113 k. the use of more observational wavelengths would better constrain the distribution .",
    "we have applied ppmap to _ herschel _ data for a region of active star formation in the galactic plane .",

    "we have analysed a @xmath114 region centred on @xmath115= [ 224.\\!\\!^\\circ 2717 , -0.\\!\\!^\\circ8361]$ ] , which is dominated by a filamentary ridge at the western periphery of a prominent cavity .",
    "colour corrections were not applied in this inversion , i.e. , we assumed @xmath116 .",
    "this was because , for the dust temperatures under consideration , the deviations of the correction factors from unity are relatively small over most of the wavelength range ( @xmath117% for 160500 @xmath1 m ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "even at 70 @xmath1 m , for which the correction is larger , it is still not significant compared to model errors since , in the field under study , essentially all of the 70 @xmath1 m emission is due to protostellar point sources which are not well modelled by optically thin dust .",
    "colour corrections would , however , be necessary for other fields in which extended 70 @xmath1 m dust emission is present .",
    "since the computational cost of ppmap scales approximately as the square of the number of image pixels , we reduced the computation time by analysing the region as a @xmath118 mosaic of partially overlapping @xmath119 fields .",

    "the distribution of dust - derived column - density values for the larger ( @xmath128 ) field , which includes the filamentary complex , is presented as a histogram by @xcite ; it can be characterised as a log - normal distribution with a power - law tail , consistent with the effects of self - gravity on density fluctuations produced by interstellar turbulence @xcite .",

    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "in contrast to the @xcite plot , no log - normal component is apparent ; the most prominent feature is a power - law - like variation at high column densities .",

    "this is evident , for example , from the blue and red histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , which represent the column - density distributions of the warm ( @xmath129 k ) and cool ( @xmath130 k ) material , respectively . of these ,",
    "the blue histogram is well fit by a log - normal , whose peak location ( @xmath131 ) and standard deviation of log column - density ( 0.28 ) closely match the log - normal component plotted by @xcite_the latter component , therefore , is still present _ , even though not apparent in the histogram of integrated column - density for the @xmath123 field .",
    "the green histogram represents material at @xmath132 k. it appears that the material at this intermediate temperature dominates the flat portion of the total histogram below a column density of @xmath133 .",

    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "these results might be interpreted to mean that the warm gas ( log - normally distributed ) has retained the density structure produced by interstellar turbulence while the cool gas has collapsed into cores and comprises the high density tail of the histogram .",
    "the reason that the log - normal ( turbulent ) component is much more prominent in the @xcite histogram is that the latter was derived from a much larger area of sky , over which the total contribution of the warm ism component was significantly larger than that of the more localised filamentary structure .",
    "the material at intermediate temperatures ( @xmath134 k ) may be in a transitional stage of evolution , whereby self gravity has taken over , but the collapse has not yet terminated in a power - law distribution .",
    "such a scenario is consistent with the simulations of @xcite .",
    "we defer a more quantitative analysis of the distribution of differential column density to a forthcoming paper . in that regard",
    "we expect that the decomposition of column densities into components at different temperatures will help in resolving some of the issues , currently being debated , in the interpretation of column density pdfs .",
    "these include the question of whether the apparent power - law tail can be interpreted more fundamentally as a combination of log - normals @xcite , or whether the reverse is true , i.e. that the apparent log - normal components are actually combinations of power - laws with low - column - density turnovers @xcite .",
    "the ppmap results demonstrate that there is considerably more information in multi - wavelength imaging data than simply the integrated column - density and the mean dust temperature .",
    "even if only the integrated column - density is required , ppmap provides more accurate estimates of both peak column density and total mass than the standard analysis procedure .",
    "the increased accuracy derives both from the ability to capture line - of - sight temperature variations , and from the improved spatial resolution that comes with not having to smooth observational data to the lowest common resolution .",
    "the minimum temperature along the line of sight can also be obtained with much greater accuracy , and this is particularly important in the study of starless cores whereby the gas chemistry at core centre is strongly temperature dependent . moreover ,",
    "ppmap - based estimates of column - density and temperature at the centre of a starless core are model- and geometry-_independent_.    the multi - temperature maps of differential column - density can aid in the interpretation of more complex systems by distinguishing different physical components along the line of sight , as illustrated by our analysis of the filamentary structure in the cma ob1 cloud . in particular the image cubes served to bring out the log - normal component which was not at all apparent in the distribution of integrated column - density in the immediate vicinity of the filamentary complex .",
    "our future work will include a more quantitative analysis of the functional forms of the pdfs of differential column density at different temperatures .",
    "in particular we expect that the temperature decomposition will provide some insight into the issues currently being debated in connection with pdfs of molecular clouds .",
    "an additional avenue that we will pursue is to add an additional variable to our state space , namely the index , @xmath4 , of the dust opacity law in order to provide information on the spatial variation of grain properties",
    ". this will necessitate the inclusion of submillimetre data at longer wavelengths in order to break the well - known degeneracy between temperature and opacity .",
    "although we have applied the point process algorithm to the problem of column density mapping of dusty galactic structures , the technique itself is far more generic , and can be applied to any system that can be represented as a set of points in a suitably defined parameter space , such that the instrumental response to each point contributes independently to the observations , i.e. , the measurement model obeys the superposition principle . in addition",
    "the formalism is ideally suited to the study of dynamically evolving systems . to deal with the latter ,",

    "two representative cases were chosen , namely a model prestellar core ( embedded bonnor - ebert sphere ) and a spatially complex model of a fractal turbulent cloud , the dust temperatures being based on a radiative transfer model . in both cases the spatial structure at different temperatures was recovered well .",
    "the apportioning of mass between different temperatures was accompished accurately for the prestellar core and reasonably well for the fractal cloud , except for a displacement in the distribution of estimated differential column density by @xmath113 k in the latter case .",
    "the displacement reflects a limitation in the number of temperatures which can be constrained using observational data at five wavelengths .",
    "the temperature resolution can be expected improve with the use of additional observational wavelengths .",
    "comparison with column density maps produced by conventional techniques shows that ppmap can produce significantly more accurate estimates of peak column density , total mass , and minimum dust temperature within the particular structure .",
    "application of ppmap to a filamentary complex observed during the hi - gal survey shows that the decomposition into different temperatures facilitates the separation of different physical components along the line of sight and has the potential to provide insight into the mechanisms associated with column density pdfs of molecular clouds .",
    "we dedicate this paper to the memory of john m. richardson , a dear friend and former colleague of one of us ( kam ) , whose earlier development of point process algorithms provided the mathematical foundation of this work .",
    "we also thank the referee for helpful comments .",
