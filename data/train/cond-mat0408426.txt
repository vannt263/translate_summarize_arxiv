    "the cobalt oxide superconductor na@xmath0coo@xmath1h@xmath2o @xcite has characteristic features in its structure and co valence state@xcite .",
    "the structure is composed of thick insulating layers of na atoms and h@xmath2o molecules , as well as conducting coo@xmath2 layers . in the coo@xmath2 layer",
    ", coo@xmath5 octahedra are connected to each other by edge sharing with the co sites forming a triangular lattice . on the other hand",
    ", the valence of the co ion is between 3 + ( 3@xmath6 ) and 4 + ( 3@xmath7 ) as in the case of na@xmath8coo@xmath2@xcite .",
    "co@xmath9 and co@xmath10 ions often have low spin states with s=0 and 1/2 , respectively . at the early stage of research , this compound was considered as a system of s=1/2 triangular lattice doped with electrons and the doped resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) model@xcite was expected to be valid for explaining its superconductivity .",
    "now , it is widely recognized that the electron density of this compound is so large that the doped rvb model can not be applied simply .",
    "most of studies reported thus far suggest strongly that the superconductivity of this compound is unconventional .",
    "the symmetry of superconducting gap function is one of the most important parameters to elucidate the mechanism of superconductivity , and our understanding of superconductivity has become deeper with finding of various types of superconductivity with different symmetries .",
    "thus , many researchers have been greatly interested in the superconducting symmetry of na@xmath0coo@xmath1h@xmath2o since its discovery .",
    "theoretically , various possibilities have been proposed on the superconducting symmetry of the compound ( or more generally , for the triangular lattice system ) , for example , @xmath11- , chiral @xmath11- , chiral @xmath12- , and @xmath13-waves@xcite .",
    "these states can be distinguished from each other by microscopic experiments such as nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) , muon spin rotation / relaxation ( @xmath14sr ) , and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) . in the nqr measurements , no hebel - schlichter peak ( coherence peak )",
    "was observed in a @xmath15-@xmath16 curve ( @xmath17 : relaxation time , and @xmath16 : temperature)@xcite , which means that the superconducting gap has nodes on the fermi surface .",
    "thus , the symmetry of @xmath18- , chiral @xmath11- , and chiral @xmath12- waves are denied .",
    "it was pointed out previously for the case of chiral @xmath11- or chiral @xmath12-wave that if superconductivity is disturbed by impurities , the coherence peak is reduced and may not be observed@xcite .",
    "however , an internal magnetic field should exist if chiral @xmath11 or chiral @xmath12 is the case , and it has never observed by @xmath14sr@xcite . these results are consistent with specific heat data , which suggest the presence of line - nodes@xcite in the superconducting gap .",
    "therefore , the superconducting symmetry is limited to @xmath11- or @xmath13-wave .",
    "the @xmath11- and @xmath13-wave symmetries can be distinguished from @xmath16-dependence of knight shift , @xmath19 ; sudden change of @xmath19 below @xmath3 is expected for spin singlet cooper pairs with the @xmath11-wave symmetry , while invariable @xmath19 below @xmath3 along a certain direction for spin triplet pairing with the @xmath13-wave symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , inconsistent results have been reported thus far on @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the nmr measurement usually needs an external magnetic field , and the magnetic field makes it difficult to obtain the real ( intrinsic ) knight shift , that is , @xmath19 may apparently change below @xmath3 caused by demagnetization effect resulting from the superconducting diamagnetism , or on the contrary , @xmath19 may be apparently invariant if the applied magnetic field is close to or higher than the upper - critical field , @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the estimation of @xmath4 is quite important to interpret the nmr data .",
    "recently , many @xmath4 data have been reported . according to magnetic measurements",
    ", we obtained an extremely high initial slope of @xmath20 t / k , by which @xmath4 was calculated to be approximately 60 t if werthamer - helfand - hohenberg ( whh ) model is applied@xcite .",
    "this value of the initial slope is close to that estimated from the specific heat data@xcite .",
    "however , by transport measurements , much smaller @xmath4 has been obtained even for the case that the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to @xmath21-axis@xcite . in the present study",
    ", we prepared samples carefully and elucidated influence of synthesis conditions on the superconducting properties including @xmath4 .",
    "the powder samples of na@xmath0coo@xmath1h@xmath2o were synthesized from na@xmath22coo@xmath2 essentially in the same way as reported in the previous paper@xcite .",
    "synthesis of the precursor of na@xmath22coo@xmath2 was described elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the duration times of the immersion in br@xmath2/ch@xmath23cn and water were both 5 days .",
    "volume of water , @xmath24 , was varied to find an optimum condition ; each sample of na@xmath0coo@xmath2 ( @xmath25)@xcite , which was made from na@xmath22coo@xmath2 with the mass of 1 @xmath26 , was immersed in water with @xmath27 , 50 , 100 , 300 , 500 , or 1000 @xmath28 . the samples were filtered and stored in atmosphere of relative humidity of 70% .",
    "the samples were characterized by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and inductive - coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy ( icp - aes ) .",
    "xrd measurements were carried out using a bragg - brentano - type diffractometer ( rint2200hf , rigaku ) with cu @xmath29 radiation .",
    "icp - aes measurements were done by dissolving a sample in hydrochloric acid to determine the ratio of na to co , @xmath30 .",
    "the magnetization , @xmath31 , of the sample was measured using a commercial magnetometer with a superconducting quantum interference device ( mpms - xl , quantum design ) . before each measurement under zero - field cooling ( zfc )",
    "condition , the magnetic field , @xmath32 , was reset to 0 oe at @xmath33 k or 300 k.",
    "the xrd patterns of all the samples , which were measured just 1 day after the filtration , are shown in fig .",
    "[ xrd ] . as seen in the figure ,",
    "all the samples immersed in water with @xmath34 @xmath28 included na@xmath0coo@xmath2 as an impurity phase .",
    "the na content decreased with increasing @xmath24 as seen in fig .",
    "[ para](a ) which means that the na ions were partly deintercalated in the hydration process@xcite .",
    "the ph of the water was nearly independent of @xmath24 being approximately 11 and this fact is consistent with the almost linear decrease of @xmath30 with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "the hydration proceeded completely only for @xmath35 , and thus for @xmath36 @xmath28 ,    .",
    "the peak at @xmath37  is assignable to na@xmath0coo@xmath2 .",
    ", width=264 ]    the relative intensity of the impurity peak at @xmath38  to the 002 peak of the hydrated phase is shown in fig .",
    "[ para](b ) . after the sample was stored for 10 days under 70% humidity , amount of the impurity of na@xmath0coo@xmath2 decreased in every sample and the 500 @xmath28 sample became single phase .",
    "this suggests that the intercalation and/or deintercalation of water proceeded through the gas phase during the storage .",
    "moreover , the na atoms can also be deintercalated forming naoh on the surface of the grains .",
    "the 300 @xmath28 sample did not become single phase even after it was stored for a month .    .",
    "the analyses was performed 1 day after the filtration .",
    "the broken and dotted lines are visual guides for @xmath30 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "( b ) relative intensities of the peak at @xmath37  caused by na@xmath0coo@xmath2 to the 002 peak of na@xmath0coo@xmath1h@xmath2o measured 1 day and 10 days after filtration .",
    "the broken and dotted lines are visual guides .",
    ", width=264 ]    the magnetic susceptibility of each sample , which was measured within a few days after filtration , is shown in fig .",
    "[ chi ] . as seen in this figure , all the samples except the 1000 @xmath28 one showed superconductivity .",
    "the variation of @xmath3 is shown as a function of @xmath24 in the inset . obviously , the samples immersed in the water with @xmath40 @xmath28 showed better superconducting properties , although they are not single phase .",
    "on the other hand , the superconducting properties changed after the storage as seen in fig .",
    "[ chiaft ] .",
    "the superconducting properties of the 500 @xmath28 and 1000 @xmath28 samples were improved drastically after they were stored for 2 weeks , while those of the 300 @xmath28 sample became rather bad after the 2 month storage .",
    "these facts are consistent with the idea that , during the storage , the intercalation and/or deintercalation of water can proceed through the gas and the na atoms can also be deintercalated being extracted as naoh .",
    "@xmath3 seems to depend on both the na and the water content and there seems to be optimum values in them . according to the present study",
    ", the best synthesis condition is the immersion to 500 @xmath28 water for 1 @xmath26 of the starting oxide followed by 2 weeks storage under 70% humidity .",
    "-@xmath16 curves of the samples immersed in water with various @xmath24 measured a few days after filtration .",
    "the inset shows @xmath3 of the samples .",
    ", width=264 ]    the @xmath41-@xmath16 curves measured under various magnetic fields are shown in fig .",
    "[ hc2 ] . the samples a and b are different from those mentioned above .",
    "each sample was single phases .",
    "the transition temperatures of samples a and b without magnetic field , @xmath42 , are approximately 4.2 and 4.6 k , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "[ hc2 ] , @xmath3 under @xmath43 t is hard to determine for the both samples , because the superconducting transitions are broad @xcite .",
    "however , it is notable that the superconductivity of sample a is suppressed almost completely under 7 t while @xmath41 of sample b shows clear downturn below , at least , 3.5 k even under 7 t. two explanations are possible for this result .",
    "first , @xmath4 depends strongly on the sample quality and is improved greatly with slight increase of @xmath3 .",
    "second , since 7 t @xmath41-@xmath16 curves of samples a and b both start to deviate from the linear lines near @xmath42 ( see fig . [ hc2 ] ) , their @xmath3 do not decrease significantly under 7 t but their superconducting volume fractions are different under 7 t. in either case , @xmath4 seems to be quite high if it is measured for a high quality of sample .",
    "the important thing is that the superconductivity under high magnetic field depends strongly on @xmath3 , and @xmath3 is influenced by the synthesis conditions such as the volume of water in the hydration process or the storage time as mentioned above .",
    "this seems to be the reason for the inconsistent experimental results reported for the present system especially in the estimations of @xmath4 and the nmr measurements .",
    "our high quality samples with high @xmath3 values have been investigated by @xmath14sr , nmr , specific heat measurements , and magnetic measurements@xcite to give consistent results .",
    "in @xmath15 determined by nmr , superconducting transition is detected clearly with @xmath3 at approximately 4 k even under a high magnetic field of @xmath447 t@xcite consistent with the high @xmath4 estimated from the specific heat and magnetic measurements .",
    "we synthesized powder samples of na@xmath0coo@xmath1h@xmath2o by changing the volume of water in the hydration process , and investigated their superconducting properties .",
    "the single phase of na@xmath0coo@xmath1h@xmath2o was obtained when the volume of water was 500 @xmath28 and 1000 @xmath28 per 1 g of starting materials of na@xmath22coo@xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 of the sample changed gradually while it was stored in the atmosphere of the humidity of 70% .",
    "the superconducting properties under high magnetic field were very sensitive to @xmath3 , and thus , to the synthesis conditions .",
    "these facts suggest that discrepancies in experimental results for the present compound result from the difference in sample quality .",
    "@xmath4 is obviously higher than 7 t in a high quality sample .",
