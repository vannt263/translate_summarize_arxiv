    "stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) is a well established and widely used technique for coherent population transfer in atoms and molecules @xcite .",
    "stirap uses two delayed but partially overlapping laser pulses , pump and stokes , which drive a three - state @xmath0-system @xmath1 .",
    "the stirap technique transfers the population adiabatically from the initially populated state @xmath2 to the target state @xmath3 .",
    "if the pulses are ordered counterintuitively , i.e. the stokes pulse precedes the pump pulse , two - photon resonance is maintained , and adiabatic evolution is enforced , then complete population transfer from @xmath2 to @xmath3 occurs . throughout this process",
    ", no population is placed in the ( possibly lossy ) intermediate state @xmath4 .",
    "various aspects of stirap have been subjects of intense research , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .    because stirap is an adiabatic technique it is insensitive to small to moderate variations in most of the experimental parameters , such as pulse amplitudes , widths , delay , and single - photon detuning .",
    "a particularly remarkable and very useful feature of stirap is its insensitivity to the properties of the intermediate state @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , stirap has been demonstrated with high efficiency even for interaction durations exceeding the lifetime of @xmath4 by a factor of 100 @xcite .",
    "for these reasons stirap is a very attractive technique for quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is widely recognized that qip requires very high fidelities , with the admissible error of gate operations being below @xmath5 for a reliable quantum processor @xcite .",
    "such an extreme accuracy has not yet been demonstrated for stirap , as an accuracy of 90 - 95% was sufficient for most traditional applications .",
    "when trying to increase the fidelity beyond this number one faces various obstacles related mainly to nonadiabatic transitions .",
    "being an adiabatic technique , stirap reaches an efficiency of unity only in the adiabatic limit ; however , the latter is approached only asymptotically as the pulse areas increase . for qip ,",
    "the pulse areas needed are so large that they may violate various restrictions of a real experiment .    in this paper",
    "we propose how to achieve an ultrahigh fidelity in stirap , and thus make it fully suitable for qip by suitably shaped pulses .",
    "we utilize a recent idea of guerin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite who applied the well - known dykhne - davis - pechukas ( ddp ) method @xcite to optimize adiabatic passage in a two - state system . in order to adapt this approach to stirap , we reduce the three - level raman system to effective two - state systems in two limits : on exact resonance and for large single - photon detuning .",
    "the optimization , which minimizes the nonadiabatic transitions and maximizes the fidelity , leads to a particular relation between the pulse shapes of the driving pump and stokes fields .",
    "it should be noted that a fidelity of unity can also be achieved by a resonant @xmath6-pulse in a two - state transition .",
    "however , resonant techniques suffer from their sensitivity to parameter fluctuations .",
    "the optimized version of stirap presented here features both a very high fidelity and a robustness against variations in the intensities and the single - photon detuning .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec - background ] we review the ddp method and the optimization of two - state adiabatic passage .",
    "then we extend this idea to stirap in section [ sec - stirap ] and discuss examples in section [ sec - implementation ] . in section [ sec - f - stirap ]",
    "we extend these ideas to fractional stirap ( f - stirap ) , which creates a coherent superposition of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
