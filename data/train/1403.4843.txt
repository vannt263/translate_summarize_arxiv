    "some nonlinear problems arising from most areas of the applied sciences can be formulated under the mathematical point of view involving the study of solutions of equations of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a nonempty set , @xmath2 is a banach space , and @xmath3 are two mappings .",
    "it is well known that the existence of a solution to problem ( [ e11 ] ) is , under appropriate conditions , equivalent to the existence of a fixed point for a certain mapping . in this sense ,",
    "r. machuca  @xcite proved a coincidence theorem by using banach s contraction principle .",
    "this same principle was used by k. goebel  @xcite to obtain a similar result under much weaker assumptions , goebel s theorem allowed the author to give conditions for existence of solutions of the differential equation @xmath4 recently , several extensions of the above results due to machuca and goebel , as well as some application to the existence of solutions for various types of functional equations , have been obtained using generalizations of banach s principle , for instance see  @xcite . on the other hand , in 1977 gaines and mawhin  @xcite introduced coincidence degree theory .",
    "the main goal for them is to search for the existence of solutions of problem ( [ e11 ] ) in some bounded and open set @xmath1 in some banach space for @xmath5 being a linear operator and @xmath6 a nonlinear operator using leray - schauder degree theory for condensing mappings ( see  @xcite to find some sharpening results ) .    for more than forty years",
    ", the study of the existence of fixed points for nonexpansive mappings has been an important object of research in nonlinear functional analysis , especially , the existence of fixed points for this kind of mappings defined on a closed convex and bounded subset of a banach space into itself .",
    "this theory was started in 1965 by browder @xcite , ghde @xcite and kirk @xcite .",
    "this study was mainly based upon the geometry of the ambient banach spaces .",
    "thus , in order to simplify the statement , it is usual to say that a banach space @xmath1 has the fixed point property for nonexpanisve mappings ( fpp for short ) whenever each nonexpansive sefmapping of each nonempty closed convex bounded subset of @xmath1 has a fixed point .",
    "kirk s result says that those reflexive banach spaces with normal structure have the fpp .",
    "in particular , uniformly convex banach spaces have normal structure ( see @xcite for more information ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is an easy task to find fixed point free nonexpansive sefmappings defined on closed convex and unbounded domains even when the ambient banach space enjoys the fpp . to solve this problem , for instance in @xcite , the authors considered several fixed point results for nonexpansive mappings with unbounded domains satisfying additional asymptotic contractive - type conditions in terms of a function @xmath7 under the following assumptions :    * @xmath8 for any @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; * there exists @xmath11 such that @xmath12 for any @xmath13with @xmath14 ; * @xmath15 for any @xmath16 ; * for each @xmath17 there exists @xmath18 , such that if @xmath19 then @xmath20 .",
    "the use of a function @xmath21 fulfilling the above assumptions yields the following result : let @xmath1 be a banach space with the fpp and let @xmath22 be a closed convex unbounded subset of @xmath1 , if @xmath23 is a nonexpansive mapping satisfying that there exists @xmath24 such that for every @xmath25 with @xmath26 the inequality @xmath27 holds , then @xmath5 has a fixed point in @xmath22 .",
    "recently , it has been showed in @xcite that , if @xmath22 is a closed convex and unbounded subset of a banach space @xmath28 and if @xmath23 is a nonexpansive mapping , then the following statements are equivalent :    1 .",
    "there exist @xmath29 , @xmath24 and a function @xmath21 satisfying conditions ( a)(d ) such that @xmath30 for all @xmath25 , 2 .   there exist @xmath29 and @xmath24 such that @xmath31 for all @xmath32 and for all @xmath25 with @xmath33    this fact is one of the main reasons for which our results will be expressed using leray - schauder condition .    on the other hand , in 1981 , d. alspach @xcite found a fixed point free nonexpansive mapping leaving invariant a weakly compact convex subset of @xmath34 $ ] , this example shows that there are banach spaces without the fpp , ( * ? ? ? * chapter 2 ) collects together examples of fixed point free nonexpansive mappings in a variety of banach spaces .",
    "therefore , if we wish to obtain positive fixed point results in banach spaces without the fpp , it will be necessary to add some additional condition on the mapping . in this sense",
    ", it is known ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.3 ) that if @xmath22 is a bounded closed and convex nonempty subset of a banach space @xmath1 and @xmath23 is a nonexpansive mapping such that @xmath35 is @xmath36-expansive ( see definition below ) , then @xmath5 has a unique fixed point .    in this paper",
    ", we obtain several versions of the coincidence problem ( [ e11 ] ) when the banach space @xmath2 has the fpp and also when it fails to have the fpp by using the fixed point theory for nonexpansive mappings .",
    "these results allow us to study the existence ( and uniqueness ) of solutions for the following classes of differential equations :    [ p1 ] a three - point boundary value problem of second order : @xmath37 where @xmath38\\times { \\mathbb{r}}^3\\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] is a continuous function , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the multi - point boundary value problems for differential equations arise from many fields of applied mathematics and physics .",
    "this kind of problems for linear second order ordinary differential equations was initiated in 1987 by iiin and moiseev , and motivated by the work of bitsadze and samarski on non - local linear elliptic boundary problems .",
