    "the chaotic ionization of the hydrogen atom in a variety of external fields is a fundamental problem in nonlinear dynamics and atomic physics",
    ". early work , in particular , focused on the ionization mechanism in a linearly polarized ( lp ) microwave field  @xcite .",
    "this problem is noteworthy because it showed the general applicability of the `` chirikov resonance overlap criterion ''  @xcite to real quantum mechanical systems .",
    "this empirical criterion predicts the value at which two nearby resonances overlap and large scale stochasticity occurs .",
    "there is no doubt that the chirikov criterion is generally robust and , therefore , it is no surprise that chirikov s criteria has been tried as a way to predict transitions to chaos and ionization dynamics in more complicated circumstances , e.g. , for the hydrogen atom in circularly polarized ( cp )  microwave fields .",
    "however , the success of the chirikov criterion in describing the lp problem stands in contrast with what seems to have been a somewhat mixed performance when applied to the hydrogen atom in rotating microwave fields .",
    "partly for this reason , a good deal of controversy has surrounded the ionization mechanism and also the interpretation of the chirikov criterion when applied to ionization in rotating fields . in this article",
    "we propose to examine the ionization of the hydrogen atom in a circularly polarized microwave field ( cp ) .",
    "our analysis will use an advanced method , the renormalization map  @xcite , so as to include higher order resonances beyond the chirikov approach .",
    "interest in the cp  microwave problem began with experiments by the gallagher group  @xcite which revealed a strong dependence of the ionization threshold on the degree of polarization .",
    "they explained their cp results proposing that in a rotating frame , ionization proceeds in roughly the same way as for a static field , i.e. , a static field has the same effect whether its coordinate system is rotating or not . in a comment , nauenberg  @xcite argued that the ionization mechanism was substantially more complicated and that the effect of rotation on the ionization threshold had to be taken into account .",
    "fully three - dimensional numerical simulations by griffiths and farrelly  @xcite were able to provide quantitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "griffiths and farrelly  @xcite and wintgen  @xcite independently proposed similar models for ionization based on the runge - lenz vector . +",
    "subsequent theoretical work can be divided into three main categories : @xmath0 classical simulations  @xcite , @xmath1 quantum simulations , and @xmath2 resonance overlap studies .",
    "the two main papers on resonance overlap are by howard  @xcite who published the first such study of this system , and by sacha and zakrzewski  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the hamiltonian was written in an appropriate rotating frame , a choice of ` zero - order ' actions was made and the chirikov machinery invoked . somewhat surprisingly , the paper by sacha and zakrzewski  @xcite disagrees in a number of key areas with the results of howard  @xcite as well as with some conclusions drawn from numerical studies @xcite . in a paper by brunello",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , it was shown both numerically and analytically that the actual ionization threshold observed in an experiment must take into account the manner in which the field was turned on ; essentially , in some experiments electrons are switched during the field `` turn on '' directly into unbound regions of phase space .",
    "that is , the underlying resonance structure of the hamiltonian is almost irrelevant because ionization is accomplished by the ramp - up of the field .",
    "for this reason , the application of resonance overlap criteria in rotating frames can be quite intricate and this provides some explanation for the apparent inadequacy of the chirikov criterion - if ionization occurs during the field turn - on time then , of course , resonance overlap is irrelevant .    in this article , we study the hydrogen atom driven by a cp microwave field together with a magnetic field lying perpendicular to the polarization plane ( cp@xmath3 ) .",
    "the magnetic field has been introduced to prevent ionization in the plane .",
    "this provides the opportunity to eliminate difficulties associated with the turn on of the field , thus opening up the way to a study of resonance overlap in a more controlled manner in the rotating frame .",
    "as noted , without the added magnetic field all the electrons may have gone before the resonances have had a chance to overlap .    the paper is organized as follows : section ii introduces the hamiltonian and provides a discussion of resonance overlap in the rotating frame in both the chirikov and renormalization approaches . in order to obtain qualitative and quantitative results about the dynamics of the hydrogen atom in cp@xmath4b fields ,",
    "we compare numerically , in sec .",
    "iii , chirikov s resonance overlap criterion with our renormalization group transformation method . the chirikov method is found to provide good qualitative results and is useful because of its simplicity .",
    "the renormalization transformation is used first to check the qualitative features obtained by the resonance overlap criterion , and to obtain more quantitative results about the dynamics by expanding the chirikov approach .",

    "the effect of the magnetic field @xmath8 is to stabilize the dynamics in the negative twist region by successively breaking up primary resonances . therefore , between two succesive resonances with @xmath77 small , the effect of the magnetic field is expected to be smooth in the sense that the critical thresholds are only slightly changed ( increased ) from the chaos thresholds in the absence of magnetic field up to some critical value of @xmath8 where collisions of periodic orbits occur . investigating this region by chirikov resonance overlap yields values which are qualitatively and quantitatively accurate with respect to the renormalization results for @xmath220",
    "$ ] . + for small values of @xmath8 , the qualitative behavior concerning diffusion of trajectories is expected to be the same as the one in the absence of magnetic field even if the diffusion coefficients may be smaller due to the limited region of phase space and the stability enhancement due to the magnetic field .",
    "increasing @xmath8 makes the orbits with medium eccentricity easier to diffuse in a more and more reduced region of phase space .",
    "the classical dynamics in the positive twist region of phase space is essential for the stochastic ionization process since it contains the region where the action @xmath15 is large , anf for large @xmath8 this region is the predominant region since the negative twist region shrinks to the singularity @xmath56 .",

    "the curve for the positive twist torus appears to have non - smooth variations conversely to the negative twist torus like for instance for @xmath229 .",
