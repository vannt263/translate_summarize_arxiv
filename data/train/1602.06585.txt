    "the inter - organizational network surrounding companies provides opportunities and constrains behavior . by creating an extensive network of customers and suppliers ( collectively called partners ) ,",
    "a company is likely to increase shareholder value by specializing on core products and services .",
    "this feature can be traced all the way back , for workers instead of organizations , to adam smith and division of labor . at an organizational level ,",
    "similar effects are likely to impact companies performance and financial health .",
    "for example , the assembly of electronic products is becoming an increasingly international process , where components and technology are sourced from specialist suppliers .",
    "this process enables companies to focus on core skills , where return on investment and shareholder value are likely to be optimized .",
    "a host of academic papers have applied a network perspective to identify and quantify the impact of inter - organizational networks on various success factors @xcite . according to the network perspective",
    ", organizations are embedded within networks of interconnected relationships .",
    "different positions in a network are associated with a range of outcomes , such as imitation , adaptation , innovation , firm survival , and performance @xcite .",
    "for example , companies in a position of brokering between others have relatively higher returns @xcite .    unlike traditional perspectives that treat organizations as independent observations and",
    "focus simply on their attributes , network science incorporates additional structural information .",
    "these two perspectives are not mutually exclusive and can be combined to conduct a superior analysis by including variables based on network characteristics alongside attribute - based ones .",
    "the first feature of the inter - organizational network that this article attempts to tackle is concentration . for a company",
    ", concentrations can exist both on the customer - side and the supplier - side .",
    "these two aspects represents two different types of underlying risks .",
    "first , customer - concentration is an immediate threat to the revenue stream as a single or a select few customers provide the majority of revenue received .",
    "for example , table 1 highlights the top customers of tripadvisor .",
    "as expedia represents more than a quarter of tripadvisor s revenue , tripadvisor is vulnerable to two scenarios : ( 1 ) expedia is in a position to squeeze its profit margins and ( 2 ) a substantial chunk of revenue would potentially be affected were expedia to default , downsize , or restructure .",
    "tables  [ tab : resultsintermediate ] and [ tab : resultsintermediateb ] shows the intermediate models .",
    "model 1 is the control model in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "models 2 - 11 are each of the concentration variables added to the control model . as they simply tests suppliers _ or _ customers , none of these models are in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "models 12 - 14 show the results from suppliers and customers - pairs of the concentration variables .",
    "model 12 was selected due to the simpler variables and the largest model improvement ( i.e. , the concentration model ; model 2 in table  [ tab : results ] ) . models 15 - 18 show the result of the concentration model with each of the influence variables added separately .",
    "it is worth noting that observations are dropped in model 16 and 18 due to missing data .",
    "model 19 and 20 show the results when suppliers and customers - pairs of the simple average and weighted average variables were added , respectively .",
    "model 20 drops 227 observations as missing data is present in the weighted average variables .",
    "we selected model 19 to be the full model due to the inclusion all observation even though the @xmath0 is 1,076bps better in model 20 .",

    "<S> this paper aims to be a first step in the direction of removing these assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the impact is illustrated by examining the effects of customer and supplier concentrations and partners credit risk on credit - default swap ( cds ) spreads while controlling for credit risk and size . </S>",
    "<S> we rely upon supply - chain data from bloomberg that provides insight into companies relationships . </S>",
    "<S> the empirical results show that a well diversified customer network lowers cds spread , while having stable partners with low default probabilities increase spreads . </S>",
    "<S> the latter result suggests that successful companies do not focus on building a stable eco - system around themselves , but instead focus on their own profit maximization at the cost of the financial health of their suppliers and customers. at a more general level , the results indicate the importance of considering the inter - organizational networks , and highlight the value of including network variables in credit risk models .    * credit risk and companies inter - organizational networks : *    * assessing impact of suppliers and buyers on cds spreads *    tore opsahl and william newton    december 31 , 2015    * keywords : * cds , credit risk , networks </S>"
