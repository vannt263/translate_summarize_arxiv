    "kinetic effects during sample preparation produce an abundance of non - equilibrium structures@xcite .",

    "[ fig : structure]c .",
    "the resulting bi atom has a neutral configuration with two 6@xmath23 and three 6@xmath24 electrons , unhybridized , in contrast to that in bulk si where the donor ionizes leaving four electrons in @xmath25 hybrid orbitals .",
    "this structure , and other unusual bi structures at the si(001 ) surface such as bi nanolines@xcite , can be explained by considering the large energy difference between the 6@xmath23 and 6@xmath24 bi valence electrons@xcite : the hybridization energy required to form @xmath25 orbitals , giving the tetrahedral bonding characteristic of si , is very high , and structures allowing @xmath26 bonding ( as in native bi bulk ) will be more stable . density of states ( dos ) plots for the bi - v structure show that the bi 6@xmath23 orbital can almost be considered as a part of the core , with only the 6p electrons forming valence bonds .",
    "two of the three 6@xmath24 orbitals form bonds with second - layer si atoms , and the final 6@xmath24 orbital remains unbonded and half - filled , aligned in the plane of the surface and perpendicular to the si - si dimer row direction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure]c .",
    "the dos of the bi thus originates mainly from 6@xmath24 orbitals , and the contributions from @xmath23 and @xmath27 orbitals are small in the energy range studied here .",
    "of the structures which we have modelled covering the possible atomic arrangements , only the bi - v structure matches the bias - dependent stm images and spectroscopy . of all structures involving vacancies",
    ", dft finds the symmetric bi structure to be most stable , with the bi - v structure the next most stable ; however , a hybrid dft calculation finds that this ordering is reversed , with the bi - v structure most stable ( see below ) .",
    "a possible formation mechanism for the bi - v structures at the surface is the diffusion of bi atoms through the bulk in association with si vacancies@xcite .",
    "further dft calculations , also detailed below , indeed show that the bi and si vacancy will remain associated at the surface , once paired .",
    "we give the total energies of various structures in table  [ tab : energies ] , from both dft gga and hybrid dft calculations , as dft will underestimate the energy of localised states thus also underestimating the stability of features such as the bi - v .",
    "the structures modelled are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : si2 ] .",
    "the energies are all calculated for unit cells with the same number of atoms ( hence we have included a surface vacancy in the calculations where bi is not associated with a vacancy ) .    it is important to note various points about the energies .",
    "first , once a vacancy is present at the surface , the bi - v or symmetric bi structures are most stable , as shown in table  [ tab : energies ] .",
    "second , given the non - equilibrium preparation technique , structures which are energetically unfavourable can form because kinetic pathways  derived from the highly non - equilibrium ion implantation process and subsequent incomplete thermal annealing steps  favour their formation .",

    "it is well - known that dft significantly underestimates band gaps , though it will give reasonable state densities and charge density distributions once appropriate energy shifts are made@xcite .",
    "this will contribute strongly to the energy differences between experiment and theory : @xmath1 0.4 v in both empty and filled states .",
    "another factor is likely to be tip - induced band bending@xcite .",

    "[ fig : comparedos]a shows a sharp peak at @xmath1 -0.4 v and a small peak structure at @xmath1 + 0.7 v. the -0.4 v peak can be attributed to the sharp peak at -0.15 v in the simulated spin - polarized dos ( fig .",

    "similarly , the peak at + 0.7 v in the di / dv spectrum can be matched to the + 0.15 v peak in the calculated spin - polarized dos .",
    "the extra peaks seen in the calculated dos are caused by slight mixing with neighbouring si atoms and are due to the method of projecting the dos onto individual atoms .",

    "[ fig : comparisona]b shows di / dv maps around the bi - v complex at two characteristic peak energies , -0.4 v and + 0.7 v. the filled state map at -0.4 v reveals the spatial structure of the bi donor level .",

    "+ 0.7 v , the bi site appears as a localized protrusion . to compare the experimental results with dft calculations , including the energy shifts due to dft errors and band bending , we have shifted the simulated dos map in accord with the shifts of the key spectral features in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparedos]a .",
    "thus , the simulated dos map at -0.15 v ( corresponding to -0.4 v in di / dv map ) can account for the spatial structure of the bi donor level observed in the di / dv map .",

    "the associated spin density is dominated by the bi atom and one of the ` up ' si atoms neighbouring the si vacancy on the opposite side of the dimer row , but shows some delocalization along the row .",
    "there is no significant difference between polarized and non - spin - polarized results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comparedos]d and f ) for the dos at the si sites far from the defect .",
    "thus , the peaks seen in the di / dv spectra for bi - v must be due to a spin - polarized bi state .",
    "the splitting between the occupied and unoccupied states at a single spin - polarized defect is approximately 0.2 ev , a large value supported by our experiments .",
    "though we are unable at present to show experimental data in support of this , we now turn to calculations of the energetics of magnetic ordering between pairs of bi - v features .",
    "we compare the ferromagnetic and broken - symmetry antiferromagnetic total energies in order to obtain the couplings of the bi - v pairs . because of the p@xmath31 bonding and the size of the atoms",
    ", the bi atoms will always be found substituting for the ` up ' position of a buckled dimer , with the vacancy at the ` down ' site .",
    "we have computed only pairs where the bi atoms are located on the same side of the dimer row ; because of the ` up - down ' tilt sequence found at low temperatures in the si(001)-c(4@xmath52 ) structure , this implies a spacing of an even number of dimer separations ( and hence an odd number of dimers separating the two defect sites ) .",
    "dft relies on a finite supercell , with two rows of eight dimers each , to obtain the dos .",
    "it is natural to ask to what extent the splitting is derived from the ferromagnetism implied by the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "accordingly , we have also considered the electronic structure of arrays of pairs of the bi - v feature in the same supercell with different separations , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : si4 ] . for these pairs",
    "we can estimate the exchange interaction between neighbouring bi atoms by calculating the energy difference between ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) arrangements of the spins localized on the bi atoms . since it is known that conventional dft tends to delocalize electronic states artificially@xcite , and hence over - estimate such magnetic interactions",

    "this difference is significant for the 4-dimer spacing , but falls below the accuracy of our calculations for 6 and 8 dimers .",
    "the calculations indicate that the interactions are ferromagnetic , in contrast to the antiferromagnetic interaction of around + 0.06 ev estimated for bi at the same separation in bulk si@xcite , with considerable overlap of the associated rydberg atoms .",
    "the difference is a result of the bonding of the bi and hence its electronic structure .",
    "there are two significant difficulties in analysing such magnetic couplings between defect pairs using dft : first , conventional dft tends to delocalize artificially localized spin densities , and hence over - estimate magnetic couplings@xcite .",
    "second , even in pairs on the insulating side of a mott transition , the kohn - sham orbitals form delocalized molecular states over both members of the pair and the bonding state is doubly occupied in the case of anti - aligned spins ( anti - ferromagnetic pair ) , whereas for aligned spins both bonding and anti - bonding states are singly occupied .",
    "this artificially raises the energy of afm relative to fm structures .",
    "we solve the first problem by using the b3lyp hybrid functional@xcite , which adds an empirical mixture of exact exchange into gradient - corrected dft ; this is found to give a better balance between localization and delocalization and to give magnetic couplings in better agreement with experiment in a range of structures@xcite .",
    "we deal with the second problem by using a broken - symmetry approach@xcite , in which the kohn - sham states are no longer required to transform according to irreducible representations of the structural symmetry group but are rotated so as to localize them on the magnetic centres and enable a fair comparison of the fm and afm configurations .",
    "the resulting spin densities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : si4 ] .",
    "the strong two - lobed feature corresponding to the unbonded bi p - state is clearly visible in all cases , as is the delocalization of the spin density onto the dangling bond for a neighbouring si up - atom . in most cases",
    "this is on the opposite side of the dimer row , but for the smallest separation considered ( 4 dimer spacings ) the strain in the surface has caused the neighbouring dimer of the right - hand defect shown to reverse its tilt , and accordingly the spin density spills onto the neighbouring si on the same side of the dimer row instead .",
    "the origin of the magnetic coupling in the delocalization of the spin density along the dimer row is clearly visible in the 4-dimer spacing case , and can also be seen in lower - density isosurfaces ( not shown ) for the larger separations .",
    "the localisation of the bi state on the surface is significantly greater than in bulk , but it can couple to the delocalised @xmath16 state on the surface along dimer rows ; in the limit of no dimer tilt , where the surface bands are half - filled and therefore metallic , the resulting rkky interaction will give alternating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions along a row .",

    "the reduction of the bandgap with creation of the surface is clear , along with the introduction of defect levels in the surface state gap .",
    "the on - site exchange , due to the coulomb interaction , splits majority from minority spins and opens up a large gap for the bi levels .",
    "bi thus behaves quite unlike a bulk dopant , or even a conventional light dopant ( e.g. , p ) at the surface .",
    "we understand the formation and nature of this structure , and its absence for lighter dopants , as the natural consequence of the much less significant bonding role of the outer @xmath23 orbital for a heavy atom in column v of the periodic table . beyond the new atomic arrangement associated with the incorporation of bi in the surface ,",
    "the electronic structure is unprecedented for a dopant at the surface of si : the bi atom has a half - filled , localized orbital , which carries an unpaired spin . given the interest in ferromagnets based on semiconductors , it is especially encouraging that the dft results show that superlattices of bi - v defects favour ferromagnetic order , and indicate exchange couplings as large as 0.03 ev between surface bi atoms . for the future",
