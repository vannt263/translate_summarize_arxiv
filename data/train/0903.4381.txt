    "in gravitational theory it is standard to take the macroscopic energy - momentum tensor of a steady state gravitational fluid source to be in the form of a perfect fluid . at the microscopic level a steady state fluid",
    "consists of a set of particles or waves whose contributions to the energy - momentum tensor are added incoherently ( equal a priori probability for individual microstates ) . a steady state fluid",
    "thus consists of a set of particles that are only coupled to the background gravitational field but not to each other , or a set of wave modes that are only coupled to the background gravitational field but not to each other . as such",
    ", a steady state fluid is thus a fluid whose partition function is diagonal in a complete basis of particles or a complete basis of waves . in",
    "flat spacetime with metric @xmath4 the macroscopic energy - momentum tensor constructed as the partition function average of the microscopic energy - momentum tensor of the basis states of such a steady state fluid will have the perfect fluid form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the fluid energy density , @xmath7 is the fluid pressure , and @xmath8 is a timelike velocity vector that obeys @xmath9 .",
    "it is conventional to covariantize this expression in order to obtain the macroscopic energy - momentum tensor that is to describe a steady state fluid in a curved geometry with general metric @xmath10 .",
    "the covariantization prescription is to replace all flat space tensors by curved space ones and all flat space derivatives by covariant ones , so that a curved space perfect fluid is to be described by ( [ c1 ] ) as written in a non - flat background , viz .",
    "@xmath11 where now @xmath12 , with no other terms with the requisite tensor structure being deemed relevant .",
    "remarkably , no dynamical justification for the appropriateness of such a procedure appears to have been given in the literature , and its use is simply taken as being self - evident .    in this paper",
    "we examine this covariantization prescription and find that there are steady state curved space systems for which the covariantization prescription does not necessarily hold or for which it is only approximate , i.e. there are curved space cases in which the construction of the macroscopic energy - momentum tensor starting from steady state microphysics can lead to departures from the perfect fluid form given in ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "such cases are typically associated with curved space geometries with symmetry lower than the maximally 4-symmetric flat space minkowski geometry . in particular",
    ", we find that the covariantization prescription does not automatically hold in a situation where it is commonly used , namely in a static , spherically symmetric system such as a star ( a geometry that is only maximally 2-symmetric ) . reassuringly though",
    ", we will find that for weak gravity stars the departure from a perfect fluid form will be small , to thus justify the use of perfect fluids in such cases .    to understand why there might even be a concern about the covariantization prescription",
    ", we note that there is more to covariantization than merely replacing flat space functions by their curved space generalizations .",
    "specifically , since the act of replacing a flat space geometry by a curved space one replaces constant metric coefficients by spacetime dependent ones , the very act of covariantizing a geometry necessitates that a geometry that possesses no intrinsic lengths scales is replaced by one that does ( viz .",
    "the scale on which the metric coefficients vary ) .",
    "microscopic physics in curved space thus becomes sensitive to the presence of these intrinsic length scales even though there had been no analogous sensitivity in the associated flat spacetime limit .",
    "modes of wavelength of order or greater than such intrinsic scales can not be described by eikonalized geometrical optics and their associated rays can not be the geodesic ones they would have been in the absence of curvature .",
    "( in flat space where there are no intrinsic scales , modes of any wavelength are geodesic . )",
    "thus a set of modes that were all geodesic in flat space and could all be described by geometric optics ( the ingredient that actually makes their macroscopic energy - momentum tensor be of the perfect fluid form in the first place ) could not all continue to obey geometric optics after covariantization .",
    "the contribution to the curved space partition function of these long wavelength modes would then necessarily lead to a macroscopic energy - momentum tensor that is not of perfect fluid form .",
    "since the covariantizing of a wave equation would not cause modes to become coupled to each other if they had not already been coupled in flat space , following covariantization a diagonal partition function will remain diagonal , and will thus still describe a steady state system .",
    "the only difference between the covariantized and flat space cases would be that the curved space long wavelength modes would no longer be geodesic .    to be more specific",
    ", we recall that if , as for instance noted in @xcite and @xcite , we conveniently set @xmath13 in a typical wave equation such as the curved space scalar field wave equation @xmath14 for a massless scalar field @xmath15 , we obtain @xmath16 for wavelengths that are short with respect to the typical scale of the problem on which the variation of the @xmath17 term is important , ( [ e33 ] ) reduces to @xmath18 , to yield first @xmath19 , and then @xmath20 since @xmath21 .",
    "since normals to the wavefronts obey the eikonal relation @xmath22 where @xmath23 measures distance along the normal and @xmath24 is the wave vector of the wave , on noting that @xmath25 , from ( [ e34 ] ) we thus obtain @xmath26 recognizing ( [ e36 ] ) as the massless geodesic equation , we see that in the short wavelength limit , rays move on geodesics .",
    "moreover , exactly the same result can be obtained ( see e.g. @xcite ) for massive scalar fields as well , with it being a general rule that short wavelength rays are geodesic . now",
    "while the @xmath17 term would vanish identically for a plane wave @xmath27 with constant @xmath24 propagating in flat spacetime , in a curved space this term would not automatically vanish , and thus long wavelength curved space wave modes would not be geodesic even though these selfsame modes were geodesic in the absence of curvature . thus in order to avoid missing any explicit curvature - dependent effects when one goes from flat space to curved space , one should covariantize not the flat space limit of ( [ e34 ] ) , but rather one should covariantize the flat space limit of the full ( [ e33 ] ) instead @xcite .    as well as have an effect on wave modes , these same curved space considerations can also effect particle motions . as for instance noted in @xcite , neither the equivalence principle nor general coordinate invariance prevents the presence of explicit curvature - dependent terms in particle equations of motion even though such terms would be absent in flat spacetime . specifically ,",
    "if we consider the point particle action given in @xcite , viz .",
    "@xmath28 its variation with respect to the particle coordinate @xmath29 leads to the equation of motion @xmath30 similarly for a particle with spin vector @xmath31 , weinberg @xcite considers the equation of motion @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant . both ( [ d10 ] ) and ( [ d11 ] ) are general coordinate invariant equations of motion , and in the absence of curvature both reduce to the standard flat spacetime geodesic equation @xmath34 ( as written here in a curvilinear coordinate system ) .",
    "moreover , both ( [ d10 ] ) and ( [ d11 ] ) obey the equivalence principle , since no matter how curved a space might be , at any given point in the spacetime one is always able to find a coordinate system in which the christoffel symbol term can be made to vanish @xcite .",
    "thus while one can descend to the flat space ( [ d12 ] ) starting from the curved space equations such as ( [ d10 ] ) or ( [ d11 ] ) , covariantizing the flat spacetime ( [ d12 ] ) can never uncover the presence of any curved space terms that are absent in flat spacetime .",
    "thus for both waves and particles flat spacetime information is not a reliable guide for extracting curved space information .",
    "however , as noted by weinberg @xcite , if the scale on which particle parameters ( or analogously wave parameters ) vary is much less than the scale on which the spatial curvature varies , curvature - dependent terms will be negligible , and curved space geodesic behavior for particles and waves will still result .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to explore what happens when such curvature - dependent terms are not negligible , and to provide a general framework for determining how important they might then potentially be .",
    "while the above analysis applies to any individual particle mode or any individual wave mode , for the fluid sources that are commonly used in astrophysics and cosmology we need to calculate partition function averages by summing over complete sets of such particles or waves .",
    "since we can do the summation in any basis in which the partition function is diagonal , for the purposes of this paper we shall do the summation in a wave mode basis as the needed calculations then prove to be very straightforward .",
    "moreover , wave mode bases are of central relevance in astrophysics and cosmology since white dwarf stars are stabilized by the pauli degeneracy of the quanta of the spin one - half dirac field , and the cosmological radiation era is described by the coupling of gravity to the cosmic black - body radiation .    to understand the nature of the incoherent averaging that is required , it is instructive to first consider a free fermi gas in flat spacetime with its familiar energy density and pressure @xmath35 as summed incoherently over all the modes up to the fermi momentum @xmath36 .",
    "for such a fermi gas the energy - momentum tensor has the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is unit length timelike vector and @xmath39 is the minkowski metric . for a free massive quantum - mechanical fermionic field in flat spacetime the energy - momentum tensor of the field is given by @xmath40 when this @xmath41 is evaluated in a fermionic quantum state with momentum @xmath42 where @xmath43 , up to irrelevant normalization factors one obtains @xmath44 since this expression refers to one state alone , it is coherent .",
    "however , it is not of the perfect fluid form , since for @xmath45 for instance we find that @xmath46 evaluates to @xmath47 with the off - diagonal @xmath48 not being zero . to eliminate this off - diagonal term we now incoherently add the contribution of the mode propagating in the negative @xmath49 direction , to give @xmath50 while now diagonal this is still not of the perfect fluid form as only the @xmath51 component of the pressure tensor is non - zero . to bring it to a perfect fluid form",
    "we must add modes propagating in the @xmath52 and @xmath53 directions as well , with this six state sum then yielding @xmath54 finally , when we sum over all directions and magnitudes of @xmath55 up to the fermi momentum , ( [ d13 ] ) and ( [ d14 ] ) are then recovered .",
    "the essence of the above calculation is that we first evaluate matrix elements of @xmath3 in individual states and then add the matrix elements , rather than first add states and then evaluate the matrix elements .",
    "the summation over matrix elements in individual states is incoherent , while the summation over states first is coherent and generates interference cross - terms .",
    "steady state systems in statistical mechanical equilibrium are thus associated with the incoherent averaging procedure , and so it is this particular averaging that we shall perform in curved space in order to determine how such curved space sums might then look . to determine how significant such curvature - dependent effects might be in any given gravitational situation",
    "one would need to construct the macroscopic energy - momentum tensor starting from microphysics in each individual case and see what ensues .",
    "in general then , the required procedure is to first find a basis in which the partition function is diagonal and from it then determine the macroscopic energy - momentum tensor as the partition function average of the microscopic energy - momentum tensor of the basis states , and whatever form the ensuing macroscopic energy - momentum tensor then takes , that is the macroscopic form one has to use .",
    "to actually show that we do not always recover ( [ e1 ] ) in general , we only need to find one explicit counterexample .",
    "we thus only need to find one appropriate choice of metric coefficients for which one can do the incoherent partition function summation over an infinite set of wave modes analytically and then fail to recover ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "it is precisely such a calculation that we provide in this paper .    in the literature",
    "the notions of steady state fluid and perfect fluid are ordinarily taken to be equivalent and are used interchangeably . however , since the results of our work hinge on an in principle difference between the two concepts , it is instructive to clarify what that difference is . for a fluid to be in a steady state",
    "we understand only that we are able to find a basis in which the partition function of the system is diagonal , with the basis states being decoupled from each other . as such , this requirement is only a requirement on the structure of the basis states , and in and of itself , it is not a requirement on the form of the energy - momentum tensor , and it is not obliged to lead to the form for the energy - momentum given in ( [ e1 ] ) . however , in the literature it is the form given in ( [ e1 ] ) which is referred to as the perfect fluid form , with any departures from this form ( so - called imperfect fluid terms ) being thought to be caused by interactions between the basis states , interactions that are associated with transport phenomena such as viscosity and heat conduction .",
    "the point of our work here is that in curved spacetime , one can obtain departures from the form given in ( [ e1 ] ) even when the basis modes are not in interaction with each other at all , i.e. that after relaxation to steady state in curved space one can obtain a form for the energy - momentum tensor different from that given in ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "this situation is to be contrasted with the situation that obtains in flat spacetime , since there it is the interactions associated with the non - vanishing of the collision integral term in the kinetic theory boltzmann equation that lead to the viscosity and heat conduction dependent terms associated with fluids that are not perfect .",
    "however , that wisdom does not carry over to curved space since gravitational interactions are described not by a adding a gravitational scattering contribution to the boltzmann equation collision integral , but by treating gravity as being due to curvature instead . as we explicitly show in this paper , after relaxing to steady state in the presence of gravity , the energy - momentum tensor of a fluid need not have the form given in ( [ e1 ] ) .    in order to ascertain for which steady state systems a departure from the perfect fluid form might be the most pronounced , it is instructive to analyze the geometric structure of two of the most commonly encountered geometries in astrophysics , the maximally 2-symmetric geometry associated with a static , spherically symmetric star , and the maximally 3-symmetric robertson - walker geometry associated with a homogeneous and isotropic cosmology .",
    "we do not consider systems such as an accretion disk but the conclusions would be analogous .",
    "for the case first of a star , we note that unlike the maximally 4-symmetric flat spacetime geometry in which steady state fluids do have the form given in ( [ c1 ] ) , spherical systems have much lower ( only maximally 2-symmetric ) symmetry and are only isotropic about a single point ( the center of the system ) .",
    "such a symmetry only requires for any given tensor @xmath56 that its @xmath57 and @xmath58 components be equal , and imposes no restriction on @xmath59 .",
    "a familiar example of this is the form of the einstein tensor @xmath60 in the static , spherical geometry @xmath61 where the non - zero components of @xmath60 are given by @xmath62 as we see , there no relation of the form @xmath63 in ( [ e3 ] ) , and not only that , there could not be since the radial component of the bianchi identity , viz .",
    "@xmath64 , relates the radial derivative of @xmath65 to @xmath66 , to thereby force @xmath65 to be a first - order derivative function of @xmath67 and @xmath66 to be a second - order one .",
    "this same problem is not evaded if one works in isotropic coordinates , where , because of coordinate invariance , the metric can actually be brought to a form @xmath68 that does have the generic perfect fluid form @xmath69 .",
    "specifically , even in this coordinate system the einstein tensor @xmath70 is still not of a perfect fluid form , and indeed must still not be since now the bianchi identity relates the radial derivative of @xmath71 to @xmath66 .",
    "since the gravitational equations of motion would relate gravitational tensors such as the einstein tensor to the energy - momentum tensor , even in isotropic coordinates we should not expect the components of @xmath3 to necessarily obey @xmath72 .",
    "we thus anticipate , and shall indeed find , that for a steady state star there will be in principle departures from the perfect fluid form .    while the spatial symmetry of a static , spherically symmetric star is quite low ( the geometry is only isotropic about one single point ) , in the robertson - walker case the symmetry of the spatial geometry is very high ( the geometry is isotropic about every spatial point ) , being in fact as high as the spatial symmetry of flat spacetime .",
    "thus just as the incoherent averaging over all of the modes of classical massless scalar or classical maxwell fields propagating in a minkowski background geometry yields a perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor @xcite , incoherent averaging of the modes of the same fields in a background robertson - walker geometry does so as well @xcite . while it is the case that a robertson - walker geometry does possess an intrinsic length scale ( viz . that associated with the spatial 3-curvature @xmath73 ) ,",
    "because of the high spatial symmetry , the only role of this intrinsic scale is to affect how the energy density and pressure depend on temperature @xcite but not to generate any imperfect fluid terms in the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the effect which we identify in this paper could thus only be manifest in geometries with a spatial symmetry lower than that which obtains for a robertson - walker geometry .    in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] of this paper we describe the incoherent averaging procedure in detail . in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] we apply it to a fluid in a specific , exactly solvable , static , spherically symmetric geometry , to find that we do not obtain a perfect fluid form . in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] we examine the tensor structure of the energy - momentum tensor that we obtain by incoherent averaging , and identify the presence of a non - perfect fluid @xmath1 term in it . in sec .",
    "[ s5 ] we show that through the imposition of boundary conditions there can be departures from a perfect fluid form for finite - sized systems even in flat spacetime . finally , in sec .",
    "[ s6 ] we discuss the implications of kinetic theory for the structure of fluids , and show that even for newtonian gravity there are in principle differences between stars and clusters of galaxies , even though both systems are static and spherically symmetric when in steady state .",
    "such differences would need to be taken into consideration when these particular systems become relativistic .",
    "reassuringly though , through the use of this same kinetic theory analysis we are able to provide a justification for the use of perfect fluids sources in weak gravity stars , though any other gravitational situations would need to be analyzed on a case by case basis .",
    "for our purposes here an appropriate model to study is a minimally coupled massless scalar field @xmath15 with action @xmath74 propagating in the background associated with the metric of ( [ e4 ] ) . for the scalar field",

    "then , the use of perfect fluid sources for spherically symmetric gravitational systems must be regarded as open to question .",
    "the essence of the calculation that we have presented here is that we start with a free flat spacetime scalar field that possess kinetic energy but no potential energy . in the absence of any potential energy",
    "there are no scalar field interaction terms ( such as @xmath126 or @xmath127 etc . ) , and both the wave equation for the scalar field and the associated energy - momentum tensor can be diagonalized in a complete set of flat spacetime plane wave basis modes , with the system thus being in a steady state .",
    "an incoherent averaging over these basis modes leads to a flat spacetime energy - momentum tensor that has the form of a perfect fluid ( c.f .",
    "( [ e18 ] ) ) .",
    "we then extend this same scalar field theory to curved space .",
    "the system continues to be in steady state since both the curved space wave equation and energy - momentum tensor are diagonal in the curved space scalar field wave mode basis . on",
    "incoherently summing over the curved space mode basis we obtain an energy - momentum tensor ( c.f .",
    "( [ e28 ] ) ) that is not the covariant generalization of the flat spacetime energy - momentum tensor which had been constructed by the same procedure . covariantizing the wave equation and then summing over modes",
    "thus gives a different energy - momentum tensor than first summing over the modes in flat spacetime and then covariantizing the energy - momentum tensor that ensues .",
    "it is because of this mismatch ( due to the drop in symmetry from maximally 4-symmetric to only maximally 2-symmetric and the concomitant appearance of intrinsic length scales ) , that covariantizing the form of a flat space energy - momentum tensor can be misleading .",
    "we thus recognize that in covariantizing a system one should covariantize not the incoherently averaged flat spacetime energy - momentum tensor , but rather the flat spacetime steady state basis modes themselves , and whatever incoherently averaged curved space energy - momentum tensor then ensues , that is the correct one for the problem .",

    "however , the situation that is to obtain in the general relativistic strong gravity case remains to be explored .",
    "this is not all that can happen when one goes to curved space , since the wave equation of the scalar field itself can change .",

    "note that while the energy - momentum tensor given in ( [ e29a ] ) and ( [ e30 ] ) recovers the perfect fluid form when one takes its flat space limit ( as it of course must ) , it does so not by having @xmath1 be a geometric quantity that vanishes in flat space ( as would be the case if @xmath1 were , say , to be built out of tensors constructed from the riemann tensor ) , but rather by having its coefficient @xmath138 vanish in the limit . in the flat space limit the @xmath1 term thus vanishes dynamically rather than kinematically .    with the vectors @xmath236 and @xmath237 being timelike for @xmath136 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 and arbitrary angles @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and with @xmath240 and @xmath241 respectively evaluating to @xmath242 and @xmath243 , for large enough positive or negative @xmath138 , it might be possible to violate the weak energy condition @xmath244 for some appropriate timelike @xmath245 and some specific set of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath138 .",

    "moreover , we would note that since a condition such as the weak energy condition is initially motivated by familiarity with standard fluids in flat spacetime ( where there is no @xmath138 term and the quantity @xmath246 is positive ) , its extension to curved space presupposes that the only role of gravity is to generalize a flat space condition to its covariant form , and not to act dynamically in a way that might prevent the covariant generalization from actually holding .",

    "the pressure becomes dependent on the radial dependence of the number density @xmath249 , and thereby generates the needed pressure gradient ; and one is thus able to use momentum eigenstates in a weak gravity star even though the electron number density depends on position .",
