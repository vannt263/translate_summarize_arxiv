    "in strictly one - dimensional ( 1d ) metals many - body theory predicts unusual behavior of the electronic properties due to their fundamental instability against an infinitesimal small perturbation of the coulomb interaction .",
    "such systems can no longer be described by conventional fermi liquid ( fl ) theory . instead , the concept of a luttinger liquid ( ll ) has been introduced which is characterized by generic 1d features . these comprise e.g. bosonic excitation modes rather than fermionic quasi - particles , a power - law decay of the momentum integrated spectral weight towards the fermi energy @xmath2 or spin - charge separation.@xcite",
    "most of these signatures are best seen in the ( momentum resolved ) single particle excitation spectrum as directly probed by ( angle resolved ) photoemission spectroscopy ( ( ar)pes ) .",
    "indeed , ( quasi-)1d metals were found to display marked deviations from conventional metallic behavior using ( ar)pes.@xcite basically all 1d materials studied so far show no clear fermi cut - off .",
    "only recently , we obtained convincing evidence for spin - charge separation in the charge - transfer salt ttf - tcnq based on an analysis within the 1d hubbard model.@xcite however , pes is extremely surface sensitive and any deviation from conventional metallic behavior could simply be due to the surface being different from the bulk .",
    "unfortunately , up to now only little effort has been spent on the investigation of the actual nature of the surface under study",
    ". this would be especially important for organic materials which are particularly susceptible to rapid photon induced decomposition in the vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) . in this paper",
    "we aim to fill this gap for ttf - tcnq and deal with another charge - transfer salt , ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 , to exemplify the importance of both intrinsic and extrinsic surface effects .",
    "the organic charge - transfer salts comprise a vast variety of molecular crystals containing almost planar organic donor and/or acceptor molecules as essential structural building units .",
    "these are stacked on top of each other with a possible tilt of the molecular planes relative to the stacking direction .",
    "several types of stacks can occur , e.g. consisting of only one species , or with molecules a and b alternating along one stack or being segregated to form two types of chains as in ttf - tcnq . however , the interesting electronic properties of these compounds are not of molecular origin but arise from the interaction of adjacent molecules . depending on the `` side by side '' and `` face to face '' interaction strength the crystals show predominantly one- and two-,@xcite or even three - dimensional features in their electronic behavior.@xcite the intermolecular interaction involves the @xmath3 orbitals pointing perpendicular to the molecular plane and ranges from van der waals - type over weakly covalent to ionic in character .",
    "an on - molecule coulomb repulsion energy in the range between 0.5 and 2ev together with the relatively small band widths puts these systems in an intermediate coupling regime where correlations may be important.@xcite it is the quasi - tunability of the correlation strength and the dimensionality which makes the organic charge - transfer salts so interesting and produces this wealth of symmetry - breaking ground states including spin- ( sdw ) and charge - density waves ( cdw ) , spin - peierls states and even superconductivity . in this paper",
    "we focus on two systems , ttf - tcnq and ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 which could be classified within the above - sketched scheme as quasi - one - dimensional mixed valency segregated stack conductors . in ttf - tcnq",
    "the mixed valency is due to incomplete charge transfer of 0.59 electrons from ttf to tcnq while in the so - called bechgaard salt ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 it arises from the @xmath4 ratio between the radical cation tmtsf and the counter anion pf@xmath1.@xcite in the following we only show data which were recorded in the normal metallic state , i.e. above the cdw - transition temperature of 54k for ttf - tcnq @xcite and above the 1d-2d crossover temperature of about 110k for ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1.@xcite     ( a ) view of the crystal structure of ttf - tcnq along the * b * axis and side view of the ( * a * , * b * ) plane ( after ref .  ) .",

    ", space group @xmath9 , with lattice parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13.@xcite the segregated ttf and tcnq stacks run along the crystallographic * b * direction .",
    "the molecular planes are tilted ( with opposite signs ) by @xmath14 ( ttf ) and @xmath15 ( tcnq ) with respect to * b * around * a*. the two types of chains alternate along * a * while they do not along * c*. within a unit cell there are two ttf ( tcnq ) chains with opposite tilting angles of the molecules thus leading to a herringbone - type of arrangement .",
    "the crystal structure of ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 ( 2c@xmath16h@xmath17se@xmath8.pf@xmath1 ) is triclinic , space group @xmath18 , with lattice parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and angles @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 at 300k.@xcite the easy axis , the crystallographic * a * direction , is made up by tmtsf stacks stabilized by the negatively charged pf@xmath1 counter ions in between .",
    "the molecular plane is almost perpendicular to * a*.",
    "the ttf - tcnq and ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 single crystals were grown by diffusion ( in pure acetonitrile ) and electro - crystallization , respectively .",
    "they had typical dimensions of @xmath25mm@xmath26 and @xmath27mm@xmath26 , respectively , with their 1d direction along the long sample axes .",
    "their lancet - like shape makes it only possible to perform pes measurements on the ( 001 ) ( @xmath28 ) plane for both ttf - tcnq and ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 .    for both systems",
    "clean surfaces were exposed by _ in situ _ cleavage of the crystals at a base pressure in the low @xmath29 mbar range through knocking off a post glued on the sample surface .",
    "pes spectra were recorded using an omicron multiprobe surface analysis system equipped with an ea  125 analyzer . for x - ray",
    "induced photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) the total energy resolution was set to 0.6ev while for photoemission in the ultraviolet ( ups ) the energy resolution amounted typically to @xmath30mev and @xmath31mev for ttf - tcnq and ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the acceptance angle was @xmath32 for xps and @xmath33 for ups .",
    "monochromatized al  k@xmath34 radiation ( @xmath35ev ) and unmonochromatized hei photons ( 21.22ev ) from a conventional discharge lamp were taken as excitation sources .",
    "calibration of the binding energy scale was achieved by measuring the fermi edge of a freshly sputtered au foil at low temperatures .",
    "all xps spectra were recorded at room temperature whereas the ups spectra on ttf - tcnq and ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 were taken at 60k and 150k , respectively .",
    "first of all it is important to note that the natural cleavage plane of ttf - tcnq is parallel to the ( 001 ) lattice plane .",
    "if we regard the extended molecules for a moment as represented by point charges it is immediately seen that this ( 001 ) _ lattice plane _ essentially bears no net surface charge since it contains as many ttf- as tcnq- molecules ( fig .  [ structure ] ) .",
    "thus there is no charge imbalance and the surface created by exposing this plane should essentially be stable .",
    "taking into account more realistically the planar shape and the bulk arrangement of the ttf- and tcnq - molecules the same holds for the ( 001 ) _",
    "layer_. however , due to the broken translational symmetry the madelung potential at the surface will differ from that in the bulk .    sem image of a typical ttf - tcnq surface after cleavage.,width=302 ]",
    "thus it is conceivable that there will occur some electronic charge redistribution probably concomitant with a structural surface relaxation . since the intramolecular covalent bonds are quite strong and hence the molecules themselves rigid and since , in addition , there are no dangling bonds perpendicular to the surface such a structural relaxation most likely will happen by changes in the tilting angles with respect to the bulk .",
    "one could speculate that structural changes at the surface will take place such that a better screening of the madelung potential is achieved , i.e. by a stronger hybridization of the @xmath3 orbitals perpendicular to the plane of the molecules .",
    "these ideas will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "figure  [ ttf - rem ] shows a typical scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) image of a cleaved ttf - tcnq crystal .",
    "one clearly sees the good quality of the exposed surface with large flat terraces .",
    "thus , the actual sample surface indeed can be viewed as representing the ( 001 ) lattice plane .",
    "the surface composition of the ttf - tcnq crystals was investigated by means of xps .",
    "figure  [ xpsttfoverview ] shows an overview spectrum of a ttf - tcnq surface .",
    "each spectral feature in the spectrum can be identified and classified according to its physical origin , i.e. as stemming from core levels or auger processes .",
    "in addition , one can find satellite structures to each intense core level at multiples of about 22ev away from the main line .",
    "these are related to inelastic losses suffered by the photoelectrons due to plasmon excitations of all the valence electrons . except for a slight o contamination ( see below ) we find only signatures of the constituent elements of ttf - tcnq .",
    "xps overview spectrum of a ttf - tcnq surface as exposed by _ in situ _ cleavage of a single crystalline sample.,width=302 ]    for a quantitative analysis it is important to assure that the individual core lines and their plasmon satellites are well separated from each other so that there is no contribution of other origin except for a structureless background due to secondary electrons . in order to determine the spectral weight of a certain core excitation a shirley background was subtracted before integration .",
    "the areas thus obtained were weighted by the inelastic mean free path of the photoelectrons ( which is a function of kinetic energy ) , the transmission function of the analyser ( also a function of kinetic energy ) , and the photoexcitation cross sections . using experimentally@xcite and",
    "theoretically@xcite derived cross sections basically yields identical results . in tab .",
    "[ ttfstoich ] we summarize values obtained for a typical sample in normal - emission ( ne ) geometry employing the experimentally determined cross sections . note that the error amounts to about 20% , mainly due to the uncertainty of the tabulated cross sections used .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement of the surface composition as determined by xps and the nominal composition given by the bulk stoichiometry of the material is striking . especially there is no excess of carbon detectable and only a weak contamination with oxygen is observed .",
    ".[ttfstoich]surface composition of ttf - tcnq as derived from a quantitative analysis of the xps core level spectra .",
    "experimental compositions are given with respect to sulphur .",
    "the values have to be read as numbers of atoms per unit cell . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     moreover , a non - negligible amount of oxygen is observed .",
    "we note that all surfaces were freshly prepared",
    ". it should be added that the measured compositions of the investigated surfaces scattered unsystematically with relative deviations from the averaged values of tab .",
    "[ bsstoich ] by up to 50% in contrast to the case of ttf - tcnq .",
    "one thus could be led to suspect that this just reflects the bad quality of our crystals in general .",
    "however , measurements of the dc and microwave resistivity as well as electron spin resonance ( esr ) data on our samples neatly show the sdw transition at 12k.@xcite the pronounced deviation of the surface composition from the nominal one may be explained by severe reconstructions of at least parts of the surface due to its polar character .",
    "just as well it could be related to processes taking place already during crystal growth , e.g. to the substitution of se by the chemically equivalent o from the solvent or to microscopic cracks or precipitations ( cf .",
    "[ bs_rem ] ) which are chemically modified . in any case , already from the xps elemental analysis we must conclude that the surfaces of ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 as exposed by _ in situ _ cleavage of well - characterized single crystals are not only _ not _ representative for the bulk material , they even are not intrinsic surfaces",
    ".    this conclusion is further corroborated , if one has a closer look at the various core lines .",
    "the f  @xmath36 line is expeditiously treated ( s. fig .",
    "[ bs_f1s_se3d ] )",
    ". a single almost perfectly symmetric line is observed at a binding energy of about 686.6ev . there",
    "exist three crystallographically inequivalent lattice sites for the fluorine atoms whose p  f bond length and angles , however , do not much differ .",
    "in addition , the distance of the pf@xmath1 complexes to the tmtsf stacks is very large .",
    "this excludes a notable chemical shift of the binding energies . since the pf@xmath1 counter ions do not much hybridize with the tmtsf molecules and",
    "thus do not participate in forming delocalized conduction bands one would not expect any asymmetry of the f  1@xmath37 line as well .",
    "turning to the xps spectrum of the se  3@xmath38 doublet shown in fig .",
    "[ bs_f1s_se3d ] we only see one single line at about 56.5ev binding energy because the spin - orbit splitting is too small to be resolved . for similar arguments as above possible chemical shifts in the binding energies of the four inequivalent se atoms should not be important .",
    "the bonding lengths and environment of the se atoms within the tmtsf molecule are quite the same and their distances to the adjacent tmtsf molecules and pf@xmath1 counter ions are large .",
    "what is remarkable is the lack of a pronounced asymmetric tail up to higher binding energies as it was observed for ttf - tcnq and explained by the coupling of the photohole to the conduction electrons .",
    "the se atoms are located on the 1d conducting stacks and a coupling of similar size as in ttf - tcnq would be expected .",
    "this again manifests what we concluded already above from the chemical analysis that apparently the ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 surfaces not at all reflect bulk properties .",
    "we refrain from a thorough discussion of the c  1@xmath37 line as it overlaps with spectral weight due to se  auger electrons and discuss it here only in the context of the angle dependence of the various xps lines ( figs .",
    "[ bs_f1s_se3d ] and [ bs_c1s_o1s ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the f  1@xmath37 and se  3@xmath38 lines the c  1@xmath37 line shows a significant dependence upon variation of the emission angle .",
    "the line is split into two components at about 284.7ev and 286.6ev binding energy .",
    "the intensity of the latter increases notably at the biggest off - normal emission angle of 70@xmath39 thus indicating a surface species .",
    "a similar even more pronounced behavior is observed for the o  1@xmath37 line at about 533.2ev .",
    "we draw two conclusions from those observations : firstly , the cleavage surface even if not as good as in the case of ttf - tcnq is sufficiently well - defined to show angle dependencies at all .",
    "an irregularly rough surface as generated by fracture ( as opposed to cleavage ) of crystals would not display angular dependencies due to the averaging of exit angles and shadowing effects.@xcite secondly , only part of the o signal can be attributed to an o contamination on top of the topmost surface layer . in the same way one can argue that also only part of the c  1@xmath37 intensity is intrinsic due to the c atoms in the tmtsf molecules , part stems from contamination of the topmost surface layer , and part originates from c contamination built in the crystal e.g. at microcracks .      in the light of the results of the preceeding paragraph",
    "it might appear questionable whether one should anticipate long range surface order for ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 at all .",
    "in any case , our attempts to see a leed pattern failed . obviously , if there was any long range surface order before , it is destroyed by the electron beam as in the case of ttf - tcnq .",
    "again we could use arpes to reveal long range order by the observation of dispersing electron states .",
    "arpes spectra along the 1d direction of ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 are shown in the left hand panel of fig .",
    "[ bs_ups ] . in the energy range reaching to 2ev below @xmath2 only one broad structure is observed with a maximum at about    1ev .",
    "this structure sits on a relatively high inelastic background which artificially introduces a small shift to higher binding energies .",
    "if one corrects the data for those secondary electrons essentially no dispersion is seen . in the right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ bs_ups ] we have summed up the arpes spectra to simulate an angle integrated spectrum which can be compared to data previously published by vescoli _",
    "et al._@xcite the agreement is almost perfect . in the context of bulk - probing optical and transport data in that paper the strong suppression of spectral weight at @xmath2 as well as the specific power - law decay of the leading edge towards the fermi level",
    "was consistently interpreted as evidence for a ll scenario .",
    "only the exponent governing the power - law decay would come out too high .",
    "however , it was argued that this observation together with the absence of any dispersion in related bechgaard salts should rather be taken as indirect manifestation of the ll phenomenology : while the bulk properties can be reconciled within a standard ll picture , impurities at the surface induce localization of the spin and charge excitations which have to be described by a so - called bounded ll.@xcite the finite length chains and the thereby imposed boundary conditions would renormalize and thus explain the unusual high power - law exponent . in the light of our surface analysis",
    "we must however conclude that the measured ( ar)pes spectra do not represent intrinsic surface let alone bulk properties of the bechgaard salts .",
    "our reasoning on the bechgaard salts in the context of arpes measurements may be parallelled and further corroborated by the results published so far for the two - dimensional organic bedt - ttf salts . as in the bechgaard salts their surfaces comprise either anion or cation layers .",
    "reconstruction / relaxation induced structural modulations have been revealed on the surfaces of various bedt - ttf based compounds by stm.@xcite and again pes fails to see a clear fermi cut - off in the metallic bedt - ttf materials and notable dispersion of the electronic excitations close at @xmath2.@xcite thus one is led to speculate that it is indeed the influence of surface effects , in particular their polar character , which in many organic charge - transfer salts hampers the observation of the electronic structure intrinsic for the bulk or a well - defined and reproducible surface by means of pes .",
    "so pes often may only pretend unconventional electronic behavior as it has been reported previously .",
    "in this paper we comprehensively studied the surfaces of two organic charge - transfer salts , ttf - tcnq and ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 , in comparison .",
    "strong limitations regarding employable probing techniques are imposed by their high sensitivity to chemical decomposition due to electron and photon irradiation .",
    "we showed that against this background x - ray induced photoemission spectroscopy is a valuable diagnostic tool which does not destroy the surfaces within reasonable time scales and provides information on surface contaminations , surface stoichiometry , and even metallicity of the surface .",
    "thus it is possible to decide if such a surface most probably exhibits intrinsic  as is the case for ttf - tcnq  or extrinsic  as is the case for ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  surface properties . in how far intrinsic surfaces represent bulk properties",
    ", however , is another question as we demonstrated for ttf - tcnq .",
    "there photoemission spectra of the valence band showed clear indication for renormalized electronic properties at the surface with respect to the bulk . from our investigations",
    "we are able to confirm the observation of generic one - dimensional features in terms of spin - charge separation for ttf - tcnq while we can definitely rule out unambiguous indications of luttinger liquid behavior in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 as stated previously .",
