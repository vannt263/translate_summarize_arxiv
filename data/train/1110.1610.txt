    "for more than ten years latest results of short - baseline neutrino experiments have been widely discussed and still there is no clear understanding of an event excess observed by lsnd @xcite and miniboone @xcite experiments and their contradiction with karmen @xcite results .",
    "oscillation interpretations of the event excess require additional sterile neutrino(s ) with @xmath9ev@xmath10 ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the results of all three experiments is proposed in @xcite .",
    "below we briefly discuss results obtained in that paper .    the main idea ( proposed for the first time in @xcite )",
    "is that in the experiments mentioned above signals from electrons and photons are indistinguishable",
    ". one could introduce heavy sterile neutrino @xmath0 as a component of @xmath11 flavor eigenstate with a corresponding mixing matrix element @xmath12 which is produced in @xmath11 neutral current ( nc ) interactions and decays radiatively into a photon and a light neutrino @xmath13 .",
    "the decay channel @xmath14 is dominant if there is a large enough magnetic transition moment @xmath15 ( it requires substantial new physics because in a minimally extended sm @xmath15 is not large enough , see @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the event excess in lsnd and miniboone experiments comes from photons and not from electrons . in karmen experiment , @xmath0 s with @xmath16",
    "40 mev / c@xmath2 can not be produced within the detector because of a kinematic threshold effect .",
    "sterile neutrino @xmath0 could be either of a dirac or majorana type . in the latter case",
    "a photon angular distribution in @xmath0 rest frame is isotropic while for the dirac case there is an anisotropy depending on @xmath0 mass : @xmath17 .    the combined analysis of lsnd , karmen and miniboone data results in the following properties of @xmath0 ( regardless of the neutrino type ) :    * 40mev / c@xmath18 80mev / c@xmath2 ; * @xmath19s ; * @xmath20 .",
    "it was mentioned that @xmath0 could be considered as a component of @xmath11 .",
    "this leads to a very important consequence that @xmath0 is also produced in charged current ( cc ) interactions and can be effectively searched for in pion and kaon decays ( this idea was proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest way to do it is to study two - body decays @xmath21 and @xmath22 and look for a peak in the muon energy distribution ( @xmath23 ) below the main one from @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "these decays allow to search for @xmath0 with masses up to @xmath28300 mev / c@xmath2 .",
    "experimental limits from @xmath25 decay @xcite were obtained for 5mev / c@xmath5 30mev / c@xmath2 : @xmath29 .",
    "best limits for kaon decays come from kek experiment @xcite : @xmath30 for 70mev / c@xmath5 300mev / c@xmath2 .",
    "@xmath25 decay is not sensitive to large @xmath31 masses , while @xmath27 decay is not sensitive to low @xmath31 masses because of resolution effects and strong background from @xmath32 ) decay .",
    "thus , a region 30mev",
    "/ c@xmath33 70mev / c@xmath2 is not constrained at all .",
    "one should notice that limits above were obtained for relatively long - lived neutrinos flying away from a detector ( photon veto was applied in both cases ) .",
    "another possibility to search for heavy neutrino in kaon decays ( which we are going to use ) is to measure @xmath34 decay chain . in this case",
    "the background from @xmath27 is small and one can search for @xmath0 in a low mass region ( the background from @xmath35 is also small , see section [ signal_extraction ] ) .",
    "one should stress here that only the case of radiatively decayed neutrinos is considered .",
    "the main purpose of this letter is to search for heavy neutrino in @xmath4 with the properties described in @xcite and in the following parameter range : 30mev / c@xmath5 80mev / c@xmath2 , @xmath36s .",
    "the experiment was performed at the ihep 70 gev proton synchrotron u-70 .",

    "the track of a beam particle deflected by the magnet @xmath42 was measured by @xmath43 ( 1 mm step multiwire chambers ) , the kaon identification was done by @xmath44 threshold cherenkov counters .",
    "a 9 meter long vacuum decay volume was surrounded by the guard system ( @xmath45 )  8 lead glass rings @xmath46 used to veto low energy photons .",
