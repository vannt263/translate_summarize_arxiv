    "this simple , yet non - trivial , example has @xmath32 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 and hence @xmath247 the moments are @xmath248 and hence by ( [ eq : hqmoments ] ) : for @xmath249 , @xmath250 applying formula ( [ eq : n moments1 ] ) to the present example we find @xmath251 which nicely illustrates proposition [ prop : moment limit ] .    setting @xmath252 one finds for the polynomials @xmath29 defined in ( [ eq : bn diff ] ) : @xmath253 \\nonumber & = & u^n+u^{-n}-2\\\\ & = & \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\,z-2-\\sqrt{z(z-4)}\\,\\right)\\right)^n\\,+\\ , \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\,z-2+\\sqrt{z(z-4)}\\,\\right)\\right)^n\\,-\\,2\\\\[1ex ] & = & -2 + 2^{1-n}\\sum_{j}\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n\\\\ 2j\\end{array}\\right ) z^j(z-4)^j(z-2)^{n-2j}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] _",
    "so , @xmath29 is up to some shift and normalization the @xmath65-th ebyev polynomial . _      for actual computation of @xmath29 in case @xmath76 one can use the generating series identity : @xmath256 for @xmath257 one finds ( using pari ) @xmath258 for primes @xmath180 in the displayed range the number @xmath259 is divisible by @xmath260 for @xmath261 and is not divisible by @xmath180 for @xmath262 and is exactly divisible by @xmath180 if @xmath263 .",
    "we also checked @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "this agrees with the number of solutions of the equation @xmath266 in @xmath267 and @xmath268 .    if @xmath269 , then @xmath270 is a unit in the real quadratic field @xmath271 .",

    "the relations between mahler measures and values of @xmath75-functions , which have been observed for some curves , are perfect analogues of the above class number formula ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for a nice two - dimensional example we take @xmath274 , @xmath275 and hence @xmath276 as a basis for the lattice @xmath23 we take @xmath277 and @xmath278 .",

    "the algebraic geometry of this example concerns the @xmath1-parameter family of elliptic curves with equation @xmath295 . in homogeneous coordinates",
    "@xmath296 on the projective plane @xmath297 , with @xmath298 , @xmath299 , this becomes a homogeneous equation of degree @xmath3 : @xmath300    beauville @xcite showed that there are exactly six semi - stable families of elliptic curves over @xmath301 with four singular fibres .",
    "the pencil ( [ eq : elliptic pencil ] ) is one of these six .",

    "it has six base points , corresponding to six sections of the pencil .",
    "since the base points have a zero coordinate , these sections do not intersect the real torus @xmath90 . equations ( [ eq : n=2 wu ] ) and ( [ eq : elliptic pencil ] ) also appear in the literature in connection with the string theory of @xmath305 .    formula ( [ eq : moments ] ) and some manipulations of binomials give the moments : @xmath306 these numbers satisfy the recurrence relation ( see @xcite table 7 ) @xmath307 we refer to @xcite example @xmath308 and to @xcite example @xmath309 for relations of these numbers to modular forms and instanton counts .",
