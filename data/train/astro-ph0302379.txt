    "v1141 aql was suspected for variability by kukarkin",
    "_ et al . _ ( 1951 ) and confirmed as a variable star by kukarkin _",
    "et al . _ ( 1968 ) .",
    "it was later classified as a dwarf nova by vogt and bateson ( 1982 ) . in subsequent documentation ,",
    "v1141 aql is only referred to as a dwarf nova ( bruch _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 , downes _",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we learnt about the continuing outburst of v1141 aql from the vsnet e - mail http://vsnet.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/vsnet/mail/vsnet-outburst/msg04198.html ] reporting the observation of maciej reszelski and indicating that the star reached a magnitude of 15.2 at 2002 july 8.927 ut .",
    "previous brightenings of v1141 aql were reported on 2001 july and 2000 september ( reszelski 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "observations of v1141 aql reported in the present paper were obtained over five nights during the period from 2002 july 9 to 14 at the ostrowik station of the warsaw university observatory .    the 60-cm cassegrain telescope equipped with a tektronics tk512cb back illuminated ccd camera was used .",
    "the scale of the camera was 0.76\" / pixel providing a @xmath2 field of view .",
    "the full description of the telescope and camera was given by udalski and pych ( 1992 ) .",
    "we monitored the star in `` white light '' .",
    "this was due to the lack of an autoguiding system , not yet implemented after recent telescope renovation .",
    "thus we did not use any filter because we wanted to have the shortest possible exposure times and avoid elongation of the star shapes .",
    "of course , we can not include v1141 aql into the toads because according to howell _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) the main property of this group is the amplitude of the superoutbursts higher than 6 mag . in the case of v1141 aql",
    "this amplitude is around 5 mag , suggesting that this star may be a link between ordinary su uma stars and toads .",
    "in addition to the clearly visible modulation connected with the superhumps we have also detected the weak signal characterized by an amplitude around 0.01 mag and a period of 0.03923(8 ) days ( @xmath3 min ) .",
    "the nature of this periodicity is unknown .",
    "this can not be the orbital period of the binary system because , according to the schoembs & stolz ( 1984 ) relation , it should be around 84 min .",
    "it could be a signature of the white dwarf rotation period , which in nonmagnetized systems such as su uma stars , is not synchronized with the orbital period .        ,",
