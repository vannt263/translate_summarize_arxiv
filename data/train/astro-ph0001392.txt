    "the old population ii stellar halo is a fossil relic of the formation of the galaxy .",
    "most observational studies to date have concentrated on f and g subdwarfs near the turnoff of the halo main sequence .",
    "the lowest - mass , metal - poor stars , m subdwarfs , are intrinsically less luminous , but have a higher local number density .",
    "observations of these stars allow us to probe both the stellar mass function and the binary formation frequency favoured by star formation in the early universe .",
    "there is currently little information on the binary frequency for the lowest mass stars in the halo .",
    "the formation mechanism(s ) of binaries remains uncertain , with no clear predictions as to whether conditions in the young galaxy would favor the production of more or fewer very - low - mass binaries relative to the present - day galactic disk .",
    "if the binary fraction is high , then the measurements of the field halo luminosity function @xcite will be in error .",
    "current transformations of population ii stellar luminosity functions into mass functions depend entirely upon theory , since there are no m subdwarfs with empirical mass measurements .    in order to search for m subdwarf binary systems , particularly systems suitable for mass determinations , we have obtained hubble space telescope planetary camera ( hst pc ) images of spectroscopically classified metal - poor m subdwarfs @xcite with well - determined trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "the targets were scheduled in snapshot mode , which allowed only a fraction of the allocated targets to be observed .",
    "as it turned out , pc images were obtained of nine targets known to be within 50 parsecs of the sun .",
    "an additional observation was obtained of vb12 ( lhs 541 ) , a more distant star of special interest since it is the lowest mass member of a metal - poor triple @xcite .",
    "we report the results of our search in this paper . in section  [ photometry ]",
    ", we discuss wfpc2 photometry for these stars . in section  [ binaries ]",
    ", we discuss the results of our search for binaries . in appendix",
    "[ hyades ] , we report on two hyades systems observed by hst since the publication of @xcite .",
    "our targets were observed using both the f555w and f850lp filters .",
    "two f850lp images were obtained to allow cosmic ray removal . the standard hst pipeline processing was used .",
    "photometry for the targets was measured on the hst flight system @xcite including a correction for cte effects : @xmath1 where in our case @xmath2 for the pc chip , @xmath3 for f555w , @xmath4 for f850lp , and the counts are measured in a 0.5aperture .",
    "the uncertainties due to poisson statistics are less than 0.01 magnitude , but the uncertainties discussed by @xcite imply there may be effects that approach @xmath5 magnitude . the photometry is listed in table  [ table - data ] , along with photometry and parallaxes compiled by @xcite .",
    "note that the original classification of lhs 407 as sdm5 was based upon a noisy palomar 60-in spectrum .",
    "we have obtained a better spectrum using the palomar 200-in . and found that the spectrscopic indices are tio5@xmath6 , cah1@xmath7 , cah2@xmath8 , and cah3=@xmath9 , leading to a classification of sdm5.0 but placing it near the ( arbitrary ) esdm / sdm border .    in figures",
    "[ fig - vidv ] and  [ fig - vidi ] , we compare the ground v and i@xmath10 photometry compiled by @xcite to our new hst photometry .",
    "@xcite estimated that a similar compilation of vi photometry had uncertainties of 0.05 magnitude .",
    "also shown in each figure are the polynomial fits based on modelling determined by @xcite . in the case of the f555w filter , @xcite have calculated both v and f555w magnitudes based on stellar models , and we also show those calculations in figure  [ fig - vidv ] .",
    "the figures suggest that the @xcite relation is reliable in transforming f850lp to i@xmath10 , while both @xcite and @xcite are consistent with the f555w - v data .",
    "the observed scatter is consistent with the probable uncertainties in the ground - based vi photometry .",
    "this result suggests that transformations used to study wfpc2 globular cluster color - magnitude diagrams are reasonable .",
    "our observing technique and analysis is essentially identical to our previous surveys of hyades @xcite and field @xcite m dwarfs . companions with @xmath11 of 0 , 1 , 3 and 5 magnitudes respectively can be resolved at 0.09 , 0.14 , 0.23 , and 0.32 arcseconds respectively",
    ". however , we do not detect _ any _ companions to our target stars .",
    "we estimate that our observations are sensitive to stars at the bottom of the halo main sequence for separations of @xmath12 a.u .. the @xcite models predict that end of the metal - poor main sequence lies at @xmath13 .",
    "the last 1.7 magnitudes correspond to masses between 0.083 and 0.090 @xmath14 , and are predicted to have very red colors but lie in a regime where the models are very uncertain .",
    "these subdwarfs are presumably rare , and they have not yet been detected . using the @xcite transformations , we predict that these dwarfs have @xmath15 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig - hstmi ] , but at present there is no empirical verification of the validity of the color transformations for subdwarfs of such extreme colors . for figure  [ fig - hstmi ] ,",
    "we have not allowed the i@xmath10 to f850lp correction to exceed 1.5 magnitudes .",
    "we compare these values to coolest sdm ( lhs 377 , observed @xmath16 ) and esdm ( lhs 1742 , tranformed @xmath17 ) with parallaxes .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have found extreme m subdwarfs that are slightly cooler than lhs 1742a , but no parallaxes are yet available .",
    "a multi - epoch hst study of ngc 6397 found no detected cluster members by @xmath18 @xcite , which would correspond to @xmath19 .",
    "while the hydrogen burning limit may be at or fainter than this point , it seems clear that the probability of detecting a subdwarf in this very small mass range is very low .",
    "most of our targets are classified sdm , and therefore are more metal - rich than ngc 6397 , which may result in a slightly redder , fainter hydrogen burning limit .",
    "we are sensitive to @xmath20 companions as close as 4 - 10 a.u .",
    "for all of the primary targets except lhs 174 ( for which the limit is 15 a.u . ) , and at distances of @xmath21 a.u .",
    "we are typically sensitive to companions as faint as @xmath22 .    since we detect no companions but have only nine nearby targets , the significance of our result is limited . in both the nearby hyades cluster @xcite and field",
    "@xcite , we found that 20% of our hst targets ( which have similar mass but near - solar metallicity ) were resolved into doubles , corresponding to an overall companion rate of 35% .",
    "thus we expect to observe 1.8 m subdwarf companions rather than the none actually seen .",
    "most of our targets are actually closer than the typical objects in our previous programs , and we reach the hydrogen burning limit , so if anything the fraction of observable companions should be slightly higher .",
    "our failure to detect any companions suggests that the binary fraction of m subdwarfs is less than or equal to that of galactic disk m dwarfs .",
    "we note also the contrast between our result and the success found by @xcite , who found that three of ten l brown dwarf targets were resolved into near - equal - luminosity systems with separations of 5 - 10 a.u .",
    " we would have detected equal - luminosity systems in that range of separations .",
    "the possibility that the high - velocity , metal - poor stars have a low binary fraction dates back to @xcite , who found that high velocity stars were deficient in visual binaries .",
    "more recently , @xcite argued that both visual and spectroscopic binary fraction of population ii stars is only 40% that of population i stars .",
    "if so , this is a signature of the formation of the galactic halo  @xcite have shown that disruption of halo binaries is insignificant . @xcite and",
    "others , however , have argued that the halo binary fraction is in fact comparable to that of the disk .",
    "@xcite have found that at least 15% of their sample of halo fg subdwarfs are spectroscopic binaries with periods less than 3000 days .",
    "this is identical to the 14% spectroscopic binary fraction of local disk g dwarfs @xcite in the same period range .",
    "given our small number statistics , our data are consistent with either scenario .",
    "our data and the g dwarf data taken together strongly suggest that the binary fraction is not greater than that in the disk . on the basis of imaging of wide binaries in ic 348 ,",
    "@xcite argue that loose associations exhibit an excess of binaries with respect to both denser open clusters ( ic 348 , trapezium , the pleiades ) and the solar neighborhood .",
    "they suggest that the disk binary frequency depends on stellar density within the cluster ( or perhaps some other parameter which also controls the density ) .",
    "if this scenario is correct , and if it applies to the halo , it suggests that most halo stars form in clusters of densities comparable to or greater than the typical disk star formation region .",
    "our results suggest that further study of the binary fraction of halo stars of all masses will be profitable .",
    "a few more m subdwarfs are available for study within 50 parsecs ; significant improvement in the sample size requires extending the sample out to 100 parsecs  increasing numbers of such subdwarfs are being identified .",
    "in addition to imaging , a radial velocity monitoring campaign is needed to search for closer objects .",
    "comparison of such data to higher mass halo stars @xcite and data for disk stars in a variety of enviroments may provide an important constraint on the formation and subsequent evolution of the galactic halo .",
    "the importance of density on the star formation process and the subsequent evolution of halo binary systems also needs to be investigated .",
    "we have found that color transformations of wfpc2 f555w and f850lp to ground v , i photometry are consistent with predictions .",
    "this supports analysis of wfpc2 color - magnitude diagrams of globular clusters .",
    "we find no companions to a sample of nine isolated nearby m subdwarfs and one tertiary m subdwarf . a binary fraction as high as that for similar mass disk m dwarf can not be ruled out on the basis of such a small sample , but the lack of observed binaries suggests that the binary fraction is not high enough to seriously bias the luminosity function .",
    "unfortunately , we have not yet found a system suitable for mass determinations .",
    "this research was supported by nasa hst grant go-07385.01 - 96a .",
    "since our last analysis of our hyades hst observations @xcite , two more snapshots have been obtained .",
    "rhy 164 and rhy 326 have no detected companions .",
    "there are now nine resolved binaries out of 55 , or 16% ; including the three marginally resolved systems pushes the fraction up to 22% .",
    "the effect on our analysis is insignificant .",
