    "( cqc ) is appealing because it expands our horizons on the concepts of computing in general .",
    "the fundamental principles of cqc broadly influence computer science , physics , mathematics , and logic . not only would turing have been fascinated by the implications of quantum computing for his own theory of computation , but he would also have been intrigued by the apparent absence of any further possible extensions . in this note",
    "we go one step further , and study the beginnings of a fundamental consistent framework for _ discrete quantum computing _ ( dqc ) .",
    "our basic results in this paper include a detailed construction and analysis of the irreducible @xmath0-qubit states in dqc , a novel analysis of the structure of the discrete generalized bloch sphere for @xmath0-qubits and a study of entanglement in the discrete domain .",
    "research on theoretical quantum computing focuses on two distinct aspects , algorithms and geometry .",
    "since quantum computing contains features and components quite different from classical computational methods , the exploration of algorithms , computation , and the theory of computational methods is essential , and includes the study of topics such as the deutsch - jozsa algorithm whose task is to determine if a function is constant or balanced with preternatural speed , and grover s algorithm for searching a database with the square root of the number of queries needed classically . but",
    "another essential branch of quantum computing research is the investigation of the nature of _ states themselves _ , the geometry of the spaces describing the @xmath0-qubit states upon which algorithms eventually act ; the properties of such spaces are important in their own right , long before they are used in algorithms .",
    "understanding these properties serves , for example , to explicate the nature of irreducible states ( when all wave - function symmetries are eliminated ) , and exposes the nature of entangled states , a phenomenon completely absent from any non - quantum geometrical framework .",
    "the geometric aspects of conventional quantum theory and quantum computing are the subject of a vast literature , and entire books ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have been devoted to quantum geometry and its relation to entanglement .",
    "an extensive picture of the geometry of conventional quantum computing has emerged , showing that the complex projective spaces @xmath12 precisely embody the irreducible states of an @xmath0-qubit quantum circuit element , and , in addition , permit the explicit study of the actual paths in the irreducible state space that correspond to idealized quantum operations .",
    "our contribution , which involves issues possibly less familiar to readers of the algorithm - centered literature , is to extend the path of the corpus of `` conventional '' geometry - based quantum computing research into the discrete domain .",
    "we start with a finite complexified galois field @xmath3 replacing the complex fields used in the existing literature for the geometry of quantum computing ( e.g. , @xcite ) and examine the implications of calculating the geometric properties of @xmath0-qubit states with coefficients defined in discrete galois fields .",
    "our work for the first time explicates a rigorous approach to @xmath0-discrete - qubit complex geometry and the resulting discretized complex projective spaces .",
    "we rederive some of the basic results of discrete complex mathematics introduced by vladimir arnold @xcite , and extend these to a discrete attack on the entire spectrum of geometric problems appearing in the conventional quantum computing literature . among the new insights that appear in our approach",
    "are explicit relative measures for counting the numbers of unentangled , partially entangled , and maximally entangled states , along with the dependence of these measures on the size of the chosen discrete fields .",
    "all of this structure is concealed by the infinite precision of real numbers in conventional quantum computing , and thus the discrete methods provide ways of understanding the resources of quantum computing and isolating the relations between resources and problem size that can not be studied in any other fashion .",
    "these are significant new results , whose ultimate implications can not be trivially predicted .",
    "this work is given impetus by the fact that the great majority of the laws of physics are formulated as equalities ( more appropriately , as isomorphisms ) between different physical observables .",
    "for instance , newton s second law of classical mechanics equates the force acting on a system to its rate of change of momentum .",
    "another type of law is the second law of thermodynamics , which asserts that the entropy of a system increases as the system evolves in time , with a corresponding mathematical formulation in terms of an inequality . it is certainly appealing to relate the laws of physics described in this way to computational algorithms",
    "however , an important observation is that the laws of physics are in general implicitly formulated in terms of uncomputable numbers .",
    "we therefore concern ourselves with the issue of whether conventional quantum mechanics is physical , or whether perhaps extremely large discrete quantum theories that contain only computable numbers are at the heart of our physical universe . imagining that physical laws might ultimately require computable numbers",
    "provides a compelling motivation for the research program in dqc to which this paper is devoted .",
    "of specific relevance to our topic is the fact that the title of turing s seminal 1937 paper @xcite was `` on computable numbers  . ''",
    "the idea of computable numbers is of foundational significance in computer science and has had a significant impact on logic .",
    "however , despite arguments and challenges noted by prominent researchers @xcite , most mathematical models depend completely on uncomputable numbers , that is , the continuum of real ( or complex ) numbers ; the mathematical framework of conventional quantum mechanics is based on hilbert spaces , which have uncomputable numbers as their underlying field . in the words of rolf landauer  @xcite ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  the real world is unlikely to supply us with unlimited memory of unlimited turing machine tapes .",
    "therefore , continuum mathematics is not executable , and physical laws which invoke that can not really be satisfactory  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    here we explore a further plausible principle of quantum computing  the hypothesis that , because of the finiteness of resources in the universe , the domain of physical computation ( thus including quantum mechanics ) could be restricted to computable numbers and finite fields .",
    "when we began this research program some years ago , our starting point , like that of schumacher and westmoreland  @xcite , was to investigate the properties of a version of quantum mechanics obtained by instantiating the mathematical framework of hilbert spaces with the smallest finite field of booleans instead of the field of complex numbers . that `` toy model '' was called _",
    "modal quantum mechanics _ by schumacher and westmoreland .",
    "our first result  @xcite was to explicate the associated model of computing as a conventional classical model of relational programming with one twist that is responsible for all the `` quantum - ness . ''",
    "more precisely , we isolated the `` quantum - ness '' in the model in one operation : that of merging sets of answers computed by several alternative choices in the relational program . in the classical world , the answers are merged using a plain union ; in modal quantum computing , the answers are merged using the _ exclusive union _ , which is responsible for creating quantum - like interference effects .    despite the initial expectations that modal quantum computing would be a `` toy '' version of cqc , we showed  in a surprising development  that modal quantum computing exhibited _ supernatural _ computational power .",
    "more precisely , we showed that the ` unique - sat `  problem ( the question of deciding whether a given boolean formula has a satisfying assignment , assuming that it has at most one such assignment ) can be solved _ deterministically _ and in a _ constant number of black box evaluations _ in modal quantum computing .",
    "we traced this supernatural power to the fact that general finite fields lack the geometrical structure necessary to define unitary transformations , and proposed instead the framework of _ discrete quantum theory _",
    "this framework is based on complexified galois fields ( see , for example , arnold  @xcite ) with characteristic @xmath13 for @xmath14 a non - negative integer ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) , which recover enough geometric structure to define orthogonality and hence allow the definition of hermitian dot products and unitary transformations .",
    "discrete quantum theories eliminate the particular supernatural algorithm for ` unique - sat ` .",
    "they however still allow subtle supernatural algorithms that depend on the precise relation of the characteristic of the field @xmath4 and the number of qubits used in the calculation .",
    "in particular , we were able to show that supernatural behavior can happen in versions of ` unique - sat `  for a database of size @xmath16 if the characteristic @xmath4 of the field divides @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "this paper explores the notions above in detail from first principles .",
    "we will focus our attention on the specific challenge that confronts any attempt to build an @xmath0-qubit quantum computing structure based on the classical mathematical domain of _ finite fields _ , and particularly on the shift in the concepts of geometry as one transitions from the continuous case ( cqc ) to the discrete case ( dqc ) .",
    "the fundamental mathematical structure that we shall refer to throughout is the finite field @xmath18 , where @xmath4 is a prime number , with some possible restrictions , and @xmath19 is an integer .",
    "we shall see below that @xmath3 in particular will give us a precise discrete analog to the continuous complex probability amplitude coefficients of conventional @xmath0-qubit quantum states .",
    "our task is then to extract some minimal subset of the familiar geometric properties of cqc in the context of the unfamiliar geometric properties of dqc . it does not take long to discover a litany of issues such as the following :    * * cqc is based on continuous ( typically uncomputable ) complex state coefficients * in the complex number field @xmath20 , whose absolute squares are continuous ( typically uncomputable ) real probabilities in @xmath21 that are _ ordered _ :",
    "one can always answer the question asking whether one probability is greater than another . in dqc ,",
    "we still have ( a discrete version of ) complex numbers in @xmath3 , and their absolute squares still have real values in @xmath2 ; however , in @xmath2 , there is no transitive _ order _  all real values repeat modulo @xmath4 , and , without additional structure , we can not , _ even in principle _ , tell what the ordering should be ( e.g. , for @xmath22 , the label set @xmath23 is just as good as @xmath24 ) .",
    "there are ways to label `` positives '' and `` negatives '' in the finite field @xmath2 , and ways to assign ordered local neighborhoods under certain restrictive conditions , but we still have no consistent way to order the numbers in an entire field . * * in cqc there is no distinction between geometric proximity of vectors and probability of closeness . * the calculation for the two concepts is the same . in dqc , there is no notion of closeness of vectors that can be computed by inner products or probabilities , although there are deep geometric structures on discrete lattices .",
    "one of our challenges is therefore to tease out some meaning from this geometry despite its failure to support the expected properties of such common operations as inner products that are compatible with our intuitions from real continuous geometry .",
    "* * in ordinary real and complex geometry , we have continuous notions of trigonometry .",
    "* additional notions implying continuous geometry for ordinary number fields include linear equations whose solutions are continuous lines , quadratic equations whose solutions are manifolds such as spheres , and continuous - valued measurable quantities such as lengths of line segments , areas of triangles , volumes of tetrahedra , etc . in a discrete real or complex lattice corresponding to @xmath2 or @xmath3 ,",
    "analogs of many of these familiar geometric structures exist , but they have unintuitive and unfamiliar properties .",
    "we will expand on these geometric structures in a future publication .",
    "we proceed in our exposition first by reviewing the underlying geometry of continuous @xmath0-qubit states in cqc , including a discussion of the properties of entanglement .",
    "our next step is to review the often non - trivial technology of real and complex discrete finite fields .",
    "finally , we examine the features of discrete state geometry for @xmath0-qubits , including entanglement , as they appear in the context of states with discrete complex `` probability amplitude '' coefficients . in particular , we extend the hopf fibration of cqc ( which is the complex projective space @xmath6 ) to a discrete geometry in which the hopf circle contains @xmath7 points . the resulting discrete complex projective space",
    "@xmath8 has @xmath9 irreducible states , @xmath10 of which are unentangled and @xmath11 maximally entangled states .",
    "conventional quantum computation is described by the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath25 orthonormal basis vectors of an @xmath0-qubit state , 2 .",
    "the normalized @xmath26 complex probability amplitude coefficients describing the contribution of each basis vector , 3 .   a set of probability - conserving unitary matrix operators that suffice to describe all required state transformations of a quantum circuit , 4 .   and a measurement framework .",
    "we remark that there are many things that are assumed in cqc , such as the absence of zero norm states for non - zero vectors , and the decomposition of complex amplitudes into a pair of ordinary real numbers .",
    "one also typically assumes the existence of a hilbert space with an orthonormal basis , allowing us to write @xmath0-qubit _ pure _ states in general as hilbert space vectors with an hermitian inner product : @xmath27 here @xmath28 are complex probability amplitudes , @xmath29 , and the @xmath30 is an orthonormal basis of states obeying @xmath31    the meaning of this is that any state @xmath32 can be projected onto another state @xmath33 by writing @xmath34 thus quantifying the proximity of the two states .",
    "( here @xmath35 denotes complex conjugation . )",
    "this is one of many properties we take for granted in continuum quantum mechanics that challenge us in defining a discrete quantum geometry .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the discrete geometric issues raised by the properties ( i ) and ( ii ) given above for cqc , and leave for another time the important issues of ( iii ) , ( iv ) , and such conundrums as probabilities , zero norms , and dynamics in the theory of dqc .    to facilitate the transition to dqc carried out in later sections , we concern ourselves first with the properties of the simplest possible abstract state object in cqc , the single qubit state .",
    "a single qubit already provides access to a wealth of geometric information and context .",
    "we write the single qubit state as @xmath36    a convenience for probability calculations and a necessity for computing relative state properties is the normalization condition @xmath37 which identifies @xmath38 and @xmath39 as ( complex ) probability amplitudes and implies the conservation of probability in the closed world spanned by @xmath40 .",
    "note that we distinguish for future use the _ norm _ @xmath41 of a vector from the _ modulus _ @xmath42 of a complex number .",
    "continuing , we see that if we want only the irreducible state descriptions , we must supplement the process of computing eq .",

    "<S> such numbers are in general uncomputable using any real - world resources , and , if we have the idea of physical law as some kind of computational algorithm of the universe , we would be compelled to alter our descriptions of physics to be consistent with computable numbers . </S>",
    "<S> our purpose here is to examine the geometric implications of using finite fields @xmath2 and finite complexified fields @xmath3 ( based on primes @xmath4 congruent to @xmath5 ) as the basis for computations in a theory of discrete quantum computing , which would therefore become a computable theory . </S>",
    "<S> because the states of a discrete @xmath0-qubit system are in principle enumerable , we are able to determine the proportions of entangled and unentangled states . in particular , we extend the hopf fibration that defines the irreducible state space of conventional continuous @xmath0-qubit theories ( which is the complex projective space @xmath6 ) to an analogous discrete geometry in which the hopf circle for any @xmath0 is found to be a discrete set of @xmath7 points . </S>",
    "<S> the tally of unit - length @xmath0-qubit states is given , and reduced via the generalized hopf fibration to @xmath8 , the discrete analog of the complex projective space , which has @xmath9 irreducible states . </S>",
    "<S> using a measure of entanglement , the _ purity _ , we explore the entanglement features of discrete quantum states and find that the @xmath0-qubit states based on the complexified field @xmath3 have @xmath10 unentangled states ( the product of the tally for a single qubit ) with purity 1 , and they have @xmath11 maximally entangled states with purity zero . </S>"
