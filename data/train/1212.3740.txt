    "an _ incidence structure _ is a set of _ points _ @xmath0 and a set of _ lines _",
    "@xmath1 , together with an incidence relation between these two sets .",
    "if a point @xmath2 and a line @xmath3 are incident , then we say that @xmath3 _ goes through _ @xmath2 , that @xmath2 _ is on _ @xmath3 , and so on .",
    "we say that a pair of lines that goes through the same point @xmath2 _ meet _ or _ intersect _ in @xmath2 .",
    "a _ combinatorial configuration _ is an incidence structure in which there are @xmath4 lines through every point , @xmath5 points on every line and such that through any pair of points there is at most one line .",
    "the last condition can be replaced by requiring any pair of lines to meet in at most one point .",
    "a general reference for combinatorial configurations is @xcite and the book @xcite collects many results on combinatorial configurations , although it focuses on geometrically realizable configurations .",

    "@xmath6-configuration _ to refer to a combinatorial configuration with @xmath7 points , @xmath8 lines , @xmath4 lines through every point and @xmath5 points on every line .",
    "when @xmath7 and @xmath8 are not known or not important , then we use the notation _",

    "we have proved that the numerical semigroups attached to the existence of combinatorial configurations allow a family of linear , symmetric and non - homogenous patterns .",
    "we have also studied the numerical semigroups attached to the balanced combinatorial @xmath9-configurations ( @xmath10 ) and to the combinatorial @xmath9-configurations for which @xmath4 and @xmath5 are coprime .",
