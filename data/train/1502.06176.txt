    "the separator theorem of lipton and tarjan @xcite,@xcite asserts that any @xmath1 vertex planar graph can be separated into two subgraphs with a splitting ratio of @xmath11 , that is , each subgraph having at most @xmath12 vertices , by removing @xmath13 vertices .",
    "additional results for graphs and geometric objects have been obtained by alon et al @xcite , alber and fiala @xcite , miller et al @xcite , smith and wormald @xcite , chan @xcite , fox and pach @xcite @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , fox , pach and toth @xcite , and shahrokhi @xcite .      throughout this paper @xmath5",
    "denotes a finite collection of subsets of @xmath2 of cardinality @xmath1 .",
    "miller et al @xcite proved that given @xmath5 a set of spheres in @xmath2 , where @xmath14 is fixed and each point is common to only a constant number of spheres , there is a sphere @xmath15 in @xmath2 , so that at most @xmath16 of the spheres in @xmath5 are entirely inside of @xmath15 , at most @xmath16 are entirely outside , and at most @xmath17 intersect the boundary of @xmath15 .",
    "smith and wormald @xcite , among other results , derived variations of this fundamental result , where the separator is a box , and hence , reduced the splitting ratio to @xmath11 in any dimension @xmath14 .",
    "nonetheless , their result required * disjointness * assumption of the spheres , which could be weakened to the assumption that there is a very small overlapping among the objects .",
    "since the intersection graphs of many geometric objects exhibit a large vertex connectivity , it is impossible to separate them with the removal of a small number of vertices .",
    "consequently , researchers , have focused on separating intersection graphs of geometric objects , including spheres , with respect to other measures .",
    "alber and fiala @xcite studied the separation properties of unit discs in @xmath18 with respect to the area which coincides with the packing number , in case of unit discs . for a set @xmath5 of unit discs in @xmath18 , they derived a separator theorem with a constant splitting ratio , used it to compute the @xmath3 in @xmath19 time , and also derived a ptas for computing the packing number .",
    "chan @xcite studied the packing and piercing numbers of fat objects of arbitrary sizes in @xmath2 .",
    "he introduced the concept of a measure on fat objects that coincides with the packing and piercing numbers , and generalized the separation result of smith and wormald for this measure . in simple words ,",
    "chan s beautiful separation theorem asserts that given a set @xmath5 of @xmath1 fat objects in @xmath2 , with a sufficiently large measure @xmath20 , there is a cube @xmath21 so that the measure of objects inside of @xmath21 is at most @xmath22 , the measure of objects outside of @xmath21 is at most @xmath22 , and the measure of objects intersecting @xmath21 is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a constant whose value is about @xmath25 .",
    "chan then used his separation theorem to design polynomial time approximation schemes ( ptas ) for packing and piercing problems that run in @xmath26 time and @xmath27 space .",
    "specifically , he improved the running time of the best previous ptas for packing problem that was due to erlebach et al @xcite .    in @xcite , we obtained a combinatorial measure separation theorem for a class of graphs containing the intersection graphs of nearly fat objects in @xmath2 , and obtained sub - exponential algorithms and ptas for packing and piercing number of unit hight rectangles , unit discs , and other related problems .",
    "fox and pach @xcite , @xcite , @xcite have developed a series of new separator theorems for planar curves and string graphs .",
    "these results highly generalize the planar separator theorem and have striking applications in combinatorial geometry .",
    "very recently , they discovered that their methods can be used to solve the maximum independent set problem , in sub - exponential time , for a variety of geometric graphs @xcite .",
    "specifically , they have just reported a sub - exponential time algorithm with the running time of @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) , for computing the packing number of spheres .",
    "we present several main results .",
    "first , we present an improvement to chan s separation theorem which is obtained by combining some of his ideas with the original work of smith and wormald . specifically , using a box of aspect ratio ratio 2 in @xmath2 , as the separator",
    ", we obtain a parametric splitting ratio of @xmath30 , for any @xmath31 , for separating the measure , independent of the dimension .",
    "moreover , we provide an explicit ( constant ) lower bound for @xmath20 , in terms of @xmath14 and @xmath32 , for obtaining such a suitable separation , contrasting the result in @xcite that was obtained for * sufficiently large values*. we use this separation theorem to derive sub - exponential time algorithms for packing and piercing problems , running in @xmath7 and @xmath8 time , respectively , and @xmath9 storage .",
    "finally , we convert these algorithms to ptas that run in @xmath10 time and @xmath9 storage .",
