    "the asteroid population , being steadily subject to a process of collisional evolution @xcite , provides excellent possibilities to study physics of collisional events .",
    "asteroid families , which are believed to originate from catastrophic disruption of single parent bodies @xcite , are , almost one century since the pioneering work by @xcite , still an attractive and challenging subject .",
    "they provide a key to our understanding of the collisional history of the main asteroid belt @xcite , outcomes of disruption events over a size range inaccessible to laboratory experiments @xcite , clues on the mineralogical structure of their parent bodies @xcite , the role of space weathering effects @xcite and to many other subjects .",
    "so far , ejecta from a few tens of large - scale collisions has been discovered across the main asteroid belt ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in terms of their estimated ages ,",
    "most families identified so far are fairly old and have had enough time to evolve significantly since the epoch of their formation as a consequence of ( i ) chaotic diffusion @xcite , ( ii ) semi - major axis drift due to yarkovsky effect @xcite , ( iii ) secondary collisions @xcite , ( iv ) non - destructive collisions @xcite and/or ( v ) diffusion due to close encounters with massive asteroids @xcite .    in this respect , little altered recently born families may provide more direct information about the physics of break - up events .",
    "evidence of recent collisions in the asteroid belt have been reported in the last decade and our knowledge about young asteroid families has been increased significantly @xcite .",
    "most of these groups are formed by asteroids belonging to the @xmath2 taxonomic class .",
    "there are , however , several important differences among the @xmath2 and @xmath3-type asteroids .",
    "the objects belonging to former class are thought to have experienced some thermal evolution since the time of their formation , and it is , for example , known that space weathering processes are different for these two classes of objects ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "also , numerical simulations show that the outcomes of collisional events are dependent on internal structure of the parent body @xcite .",
    "because of these reasons it is necessary to identify also young @xmath3-class families in dynamically stable regions , because a few such groups are already known , but none of these is well suited to extract reliable enough information . two @xmath3-type families , namely veritas and theobalda , about 8.3 and 6.7 myr old respectively , are both located in dynamically unstable region @xcite .",
    "thus , despite their young ages , these families evolved significantly since post - impact situation .",
    "most of the asteroids belonging to beagle family @xcite , which is probably less than 10 myr old , are located in dynamically relatively stable region .",
    "however , this group is embedded in the large themis family making distinction between the real members of the group and background objects very difficult .",
    "finally , the youngest known group that might be formed by @xmath3-type asteroids is emilkowalski cluster , which is only @xmath4 kyr old @xcite .",
    "however , it seems to be rather an @xmath5- than @xmath3-type group because albedos of its members are much higher than expected for @xmath3-type objects .",
    "for example , geometric albedo of asteroid ( 14627 ) emilkowalski is @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "thus , it is of extreme importance to identify young families , that belong to the most primitive @xmath3 class , that do not suffer from above mentioned problems .",
    "we have found the first example of this kind to be the lorre cluster , recently discovered by @xcite . according to existing color data its largest member , ( 5438 )  lorre ,",
    "is a primitive carbonaceous @xmath3-class asteroid , which may contain organic materials .",
    "moreover , the members of this cluster are located in dynamical stable region and very tightly packed in the space of proper orbital elements @xcite , suggesting a likely young age . therefore , its post - impact evolution should have been very limited .",
    "this makes it a very promising candidate for different possible studies .",
    "two crucial prerequisites for these studies are an accurate identification of its members , and a reliable estimation of its age . these are the questions we address here .",
    "a dynamical criterion for family membership is based on distances among the objects in the space of proper orbital elements : semi - major axis ( @xmath7 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath8 ) , and inclination ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "usually , for this purpose the hierarchical clustering method ( hcm ) and standard metric ( @xmath10 ) are used @xcite .",
    "this metric is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the heliocentric velocity of an asteroid on a circular orbit having the semi - major axis @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath13  =  @xmath14 , @xmath15  =  @xmath16 , and @xmath17  =  @xmath18 , where the indexes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) denote the two bodies under consideration .",
    "the hcm connects all objects whose mutual distances ( expressed in meters per second ) are below a threshold value ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "following the method described in @xcite we calculated synthetic proper elements for 148 asteroids located in a region somewhat wider than that occupied by the cluster .",
    "this region covers the following ranges in the osculating orbital elements : 2.738 @xmath20 2.758 au , 0.13 @xmath21 0.39 and 23 @xmath22 31@xmath23 .",
    "the number of asteroids includes numbered , multi- and single - opposition objects , found in the recent version of catalogs of osculating elements retrieved from the astdys web page .",
    "then , we applied the hcm to this set of proper elements , and we analyzed the number of dynamically linked objects identified at different mutual distances ( fig .",
    "[ f : nfv ] ) . in particular , this was done by changing @xmath19 from 10 to 200 m  s@xmath24 at discrete steps of 10 m  s@xmath24 . at the lowest tested value of @xmath25 m",
    "s@xmath24 the hcm links 14 asteroids with lorre , while the number of members raises to 19 for 20  m s@xmath24 .",
    "the number of dynamically associated members remains a constant until @xmath26 m  s@xmath24 , when one body , asteroid 2006 ax@xmath27 is added .",
    "later on , no additional body is linked to the cluster , even for the largest used value of @xmath28 m  s@xmath24 .    from these results",
    "we can draw three basic conclusions : ( i ) the cluster is extremely compact and very well separated from the background population ; ( ii ) the nominal membership of the cluster is best characterized at @xmath29 m  s@xmath24 ; ( iii ) the asteroid connected with the group at 80 m  s@xmath24 is likely a close background object .",
    "thus , the lorre cluster has 19 currently known members ( table  [ t : lorre_prop ] ) .",
    "these asteroids are very tightly packed with mutual distances significantly smaller than in the cases of typical families in the main asteroid belt .",
    ".proper orbital elements of the asteroids belonging to the lorre cluster . in columns",
    "are given : semi - major axis ( @xmath7 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath8 ) , sine of inclination ( @xmath30 ) , mean motion ( @xmath31 ) , frequency of the longitude of perihelion ( @xmath32 ) and frequency of the longitude of node ( @xmath33 ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     although a detail study of the evf is beyond the scope of this paper , we want to emphasize here that there is a clear trend in the velocity - size relationship .",
    "this trend is in agreement with previous studies @xcite suggesting that smaller fragments are ejected on the average with slightly higher velocities .",
    "however , the number of known cluster members is still too small at the moment to analyze this trend in more detail .",
    "finally , it should be noted that differences in velocities ( table  [ t : lorre_evf ] ) are much smaller than what is usually expected in the cases of dynamical families produced by disruption events .",
    "in fact , lorre seems to be likely issued from a moderate - energy cratering event , and is the most compact group known so far among high - inclination families @xcite .",
    "some important information about the impact physics can be obtained by studying the size - frequency distributions ( sfds ) of asteroid families @xcite .",
    "it is generally found that these distribution can be described by a power law , n(@xmath34d ) @xmath35 .",
    "younger asteroid families generally have steeper sfds which are generally thought to evolve with time toward shallower trends due to collisional and dynamical erosion of the family . a correct way to fit these distributions , i.e. to estimate exponent @xmath36 , is to adopt an approach based on maximum likelihood method applied to bi - truncated pareto distributions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the number of family members is currently too small to perform such a statistical analysis .",
    "thus , we used an alternative approach based on the least - squares method to estimate the exponent @xmath36 . in this way , by fitting cumulative size distribution , for objects between 3.0 and 4.5 km in diameters , we found @xmath36 to be @xmath37 . this value is smaller than expected for typical young asteroid families @xcite .",
    "likely , this result is affected by the observational incompleteness and a real @xmath36 is somewhat larger . in any case , for a moment , we can only say qualitatively that the cumulative size distribution does not appear to be very steep .",
    "it is interesting to estimate what was expected collisional lifetime of the lorre cluster parent body .",
    "this computation depends on many parameters , including mainly the inventory and size distribution of the possible impactors , the average impact velocity and , for what concerns the outcomes of the collisions , on the impact strength of the body , which in turn depends on its size and density .",
    "we computed the mean intrinsic collision probability and the mean impact velocity for the collisions between ( 5438 ) lorre and other main - belt asteroids using the approach of @xcite .",
    "the mean impact velocity results to be about @xmath38 km  s@xmath24 , due to the high - inclination orbit of ( 5438 ) lorre . under standard assumptions on the cumulative size distribution of the population of possible projectiles , described by a power - law with an exponent of @xmath39 , a density value of @xmath40 g  @xmath41 , and setting the impact strength on the basis of the results of @xcite , the estimated collisional lifetime of ( 5438 )",
    "lorre is @xmath42  gyr , in agreement with results of some independent studies @xcite .",
    "this relatively high value does not change much by steepening the size distribution of the projectiles ( the lifetime becomes @xmath43  gyr if the power - law exponent is increased to the value of @xmath44 ) , nor by changing the value of the density .",
    "asteroid lorre is isolated , and there are no asteroids of similar size in its surroundings which might have been produced by the disruption of a hypothetical common parent body .",
    "we are led therefore to conclude that lorre could be a pristine asteroid , which survived nearly intact since the time of its formation .",
    "this makes its analysis even more interesting .",
    "here we show the first example of a young asteroid cluster located in a dynamically stable region , which was produced by partial disruption of a primitive body about 30 km in size .",
    "we estimate its age to be only @xmath0 myr , thus its post - impact evolution is very limited .",
    "the large difference in size between the largest object and the other cluster members means that this was a cratering event .",
    "the parent body had a large orbital inclination , and was subject to collisions with typical impact speeds higher by a factor of @xmath1 than in the most common situations encountered in the main belt .",
    "for the first time we have at disposal the observable outcomes of a very recent event to study high - speed collisions involving primitive asteroids , providing very useful constraints to numerical simulations of these events @xcite and to laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "this is the best preserved young asteroid family produced by partial disruption of a primitive asteroid , of a kind which is supposed to have survived nearly unaltered since the epoch of formation of the solar system .",
    "being young and well distinct from the background population , this cluster provides very useful information that can help to answer several long - debated questions in planetary science .",
    "examples include a better understanding of impact physics , material strength and the role of space weathering . these process , highly dependent on the composition of the objects , are so far poorly constrained for primitive asteroids .    among the members of the lorre cluster",
    "there are several asteroid pairs , couples of objects with nearly identical orbital parameters .",
    "these pairs may well consist of couples of fragments which were ejected with nearly identical ejection velocities .",
    "another possibility is that they might actually be the components of former binary systems originally produced by the collision , and later decoupled by some mechanisms @xcite .",
    "production of binary systems in collisional events has been suggested by numerical simulations @xcite , but their expected abundance in asteroid families has not been firmly established yet .",
    "the young age of the lorre cluster as well as its sharp separation from background objects may potentially help to better understand both populations , binaries and pairs .",
    "an interesting possibility for future work comes from a recent result of @xcite how found that low - energy impacts into rubble - pile and monolithic targets produce different features in the resulting sfd , and , thus , this is a potentially diagnostic tool to study the initial conditions just after the impact and the internal structure of the parent bodies of asteroid families . according to @xcite , cratering events , produced by small impactors ,",
    "can potentially provide even more information about the internal structure of the parent body than catastrophic or super - catastrophic events produced by large impactors .",
    "thus , the lorre cluster seems to be a very promising candidate .",
    "next , the lorre cluster may be very useful to improve our knowledge about space weathering processes acting on primitive bodies , a debated subject since results based on the sloan digital sky survey broadband photometry @xcite are not consistent with the results of some laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "finally , the cluster may be a very interesting place to search for new main - belt comets ( mbcs ) .",
    "a recent findings by @xcite supports an idea that this kind of objects may be preferentially found among the members of young asteroid families @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "members of lorre cluster are particularly interesting candidates because their heliocentric distances are smaller than those of currently known mbcs .",
    "thus , they may provide a clue about the inner edge of populations of mbcs .",
