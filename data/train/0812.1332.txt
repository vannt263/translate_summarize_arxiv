    "an important counterexample is that of the ideal bose gas , where the second order transition to the condensed phase occurs in the absence of interactions , being driven solely by quantum statistical effects .",
    "however , the inclusion of even very weak interactions into the description of the condensation transition has proven to be a great theoretical challenge .",
    "for example , agreement on the effect of vanishingly small s - wave interactions on the critical temperature was only recently reached , after approximately 50 years of debate ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps one of the most beautiful results of statistical physics is the concept of universality  that the properties of a system in the critical region are independent of the microscopic details of the system , and depend only on a few general system features such its dimensionality and the symmetry of the order parameter that emerges at the transition . in this context",
    ", the critical behavior of a weakly interacting 3d bose gas should be identical to that of @xmath0he at the superfluid transition , or to other systems of the same universality class ( usually referred to as the 3d xy universality class ) .",
    "accordingly , high precision experimental measurements of critical @xmath0he ( e.g. see @xcite ) are usually compared against theoretical calculations using idealized xy or @xmath1 models @xcite , rather than a microscopic description of the system .",
    "the availability of experimental techniques for measuring correlations @xcite is an important feature of the ultra - cold atom systems that has received extensive theoretical attention , particularly in relation to ( zero temperature ) quantum phase transitions ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "another area of interest is the effect of critical fluctuations on correlations in the system at the finite temperature transition , particularly as other quantities usually examined in condensed matter ( e.g. susceptibilities and heat capacity ) are not easy to measure in atomic gases . while the critical fluctuations of weakly interacting 1d and 2d bose gases are dominant over a wide temperature range ( e.g. see @xcite ) , it was previously thought that the width of the critical region about condensation temperature , @xmath2 , would be far too narrow to permit experimental investigation in the 3d system .",

    "@xcite have made such measurements of a trapped 3d bose gas , and were able to determine the critical exponent for the divergence of the correlation length to be @xmath3 . in its own",

    "additionally , this direct measurement of two - point correlations is of interest because it has not been possible to do this in helium , although a value for the correlation length critical exponent of helium ( @xmath5 ) is inferred from the heat capacity exponent using josephson scaling relation , @xmath6 .",

    "such systems , confined to a finite region of size @xmath7 , are well - described by finite - size scaling theory @xcite .",
    "this theory shows that there is a universal scaling function that relates physical quantities of the finite to infinite systems depending on the quantity , the ratio of the correlation length to the system size , and the nature of the boundary conditions . in this context",

    "@xcite did not observe finite - size effects : their two - point measurements were made over a region much smaller than the spatial extent of the critical region , and yielded a value of the critical exponent in line with the uniform system .    in our opinion",
    "the study of the finite - size effects in this system should be rich and would be worth additional theoretical and experimental investigation .",

    "the subject of condensate number fluctuations has been extensively discussed in the dilute gas bec literature ( e.g. see the review of @xcite and references therein ) , particularly the unphysical large fluctuations for the ideal gas predicted within the grand canonical ensemble .    in fig .",
    "[ n0distfig ] we show histograms of the the condensate ( lowest mode ) number distribution across the transition .",
    "we see the development of coherence in the system as the shape of the distribution changes from being maximum at @xmath151 above the transition , to having a maximum at finite @xmath56 below the transition .",
    "we also find that as the temperature decreases the condensate number fluctuations are suppressed , i.e. @xmath152 ( as was implicit in the behavior of @xmath146 observed above ) and that the distribution has negative skew .",
    "given the phenomenal recent interest in measuring spatial correlations in ultra - cold atom systems @xcite , it would be of great interest to develop analogous techniques for observing these condensate number distribution in experiments .",
    "it is difficult to devise an experimental procedure which could be used to measure @xmath153 ( or @xmath56 ) in a manner equivalent to ( [ alphac ] ) , which requires complete phase and amplitude information about the field .",
    "so here we propose a quantity that can be directly measured in experiments and used to reveal the transition from incoherent to coherent number statistics of the condensate mode .",
    "in particular , we consider the central momentum column density @xmath154_{p_x = p_y=0},\\ ] ] as an observable , since it proportional to the peak density measured in the usual absorption images taken of ultra - cold systems @xcite .",
    "the motivation for choosing this quantity is that the long range coherence of the condensate is clearly revealed as a peak in momentum space , thus the central momentum value is correlated with the condensate occupation .",
    "the detailed relationship between @xmath155 and @xmath56 is not unique , due to the contribution of the noncondensate to @xmath155 .",
    "so measurements of @xmath155 can not be considered equivalent to the condensate yet , as we show below , there are clear qualitative similarities between the distributions of both quantities .    in fig .",
    "[ numfluctsfig ] we compare the distributions for @xmath155 and @xmath56 obtained from analysis of data sets from the same pgpe calculations .",
    "qualitatively , the behavior of these distributions appears to be quite similar . the @xmath155 distribution is clearly seen to be offset from zero at high temperatures as compared to the @xmath56 distribution ( see figs . [ numfluctsfig](e ) and ( j ) ) .",
    "this offset is related to the average momentum column density of the noncondensate component .",
    "comparison of ( a - e ) histograms of condensate / ground mode number distribution and ( f - j ) the the central momentum column density distribution across the critical point . results ( a - e ) and ( f - j ) correspond to the temperatures @xmath103 respectively.,width=316 ]",
    "in this work we have developed a theoretical tool for studying critical physics in the 3d trapped bose gas , motivated by the recent theoretical work by the eth group @xcite . for numerical convenience",
    "we have studied a trapped bose gas with different parameters to the experimental system , yet obtain a critical exponent that agrees to within the error bars of both results .",
    "we have discussed finite - size effects and show that they can significantly alter the critical physics for systems with a small ginzburg length . finally , we considered fluctuations of the condensate mode occupation across the transition region , and have shown that measurements of the central momentum column density can be used to experimentally reveal the emergence of coherent statistics in the system .",
    "our study here represents the first quantitative theoretical calculations for this system beyond meanfield level .",
    "however , there are numerous avenues for improvement of our approach that could be used to obtain higher precision results , which we believe will be needed to develop a better understanding of the trapped system critical physics , and stimulate more experiments in this fascinating new area for ultra - cold atomic gases . for instance , it would be interesting to apply the stochastic pgpe ( spgpe ) formalism @xcite to the critical regime , as both the chemical potential and temperature are control parameters in this approach .",
    "this may allow more precise measurement of critical exponents and would make direct comparisons with the fixed @xmath156 experiment of donner _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite more easy to achieve .",
    "and @xmath79 vary as we change @xmath78 . ]",
    "another avenue of investigation would be to build on our formalism a more efficient method of sampling , e.g. using monte carlo algorithms ( e.g. see @xcite ) . with additional improvements in precision",
    "we believe our formalism will be able to provide a detailed characterization of the finite - size cross over functions for the trapped bose gas .",
    "knowledge of these functions would be useful for several problems of current interest in the ultra - cold atomic physics , such as better understanding of the quasi-2d behavior and the emergence of phase defects in quenches across the critical regime @xcite .",
