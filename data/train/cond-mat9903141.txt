    "growth of new materials with tailored properties is one of the most active research directions for physicists . as pointed out by silvan schweber in his brilliant analysis of the evolution of physics after world war ii : `` an important transformation has taken place in physics : as had previously happened in chemistry , an ever larger fraction of the efforts in the field [ are ] being devoted to the study of novelty [ creation of new structures , new objects and new phenomena ] rather than to the elucidation of fundamental laws and interactions [ ... ] condensed matter physics has indeed become the study of systems that have never before existed . ''",
    "@xcite    among these new materials , those presenting a structure controlled down to the nanometer scale are being extensively studied @xcite .",
    "there are different ways to build up nanostructured systems @xcite : atomic deposition @xcite , mechanical milling @xcite , chemical methods @xcite , gas - aggregation techniques @xcite  each of these techniques has its own advantages , but , as happens with atomic deposition techniques , the requisites of _ control _ ( in terms of characterization and flexibility ) and _ efficiency _ ( in terms of quantity of matter obtained per second ) are generally incompatible . as a physicist wishing to understand the details of the processes involved in the building of these nanostructures , i will focus in this review on a carefully _ controlled _ method : low energy cluster deposition @xcite .",
    "clusters are large `` molecules '' containing typically from 10 to 2000 atoms , and have been studied for their specific physical properties ( mostly due to their large surface to volume ratio ) which are _ size dependent _ and different from both the atoms and the bulk material @xcite . by depositing _",
    "clusters on a substrate , one can build nanostructures of two types : in the submonolayer range , separated ( and hopefully ordered ) nanoislands , and for higher thicknesses , thin films or cluster assembled materials ( cam ) .",
    "the main advantage of the cluster deposition technique is that one can carefully control the building block ( i.e. the cluster ) and characterize the growth mechanisms . by changing the _ size _ of the incident clusters",
    "one can change the growth mechanisms @xcite and the characteristics of the materials .",
    "for example , it has been shown that by changing the mean size of the incident carbon clusters , one can modify the properties of the carbon film , from graphitic to diamond - like @xcite .",
    "this review is organized as follows .",
    "first , i present briefly the interest of nanostructures , both in the domain of nanoislands arranged on a substrate and as nanostructured , continuous films .",
    "i also review the different strategies employed to deposit _ clusters _ on a substrate : by accelerating them or by achieving their soft - landing .",
    "the scope of this section is to convince the reader that cluster deposition is a promising technique for nanostructure growth in a variety of domains , and therefore deserves a careful study . in section [ sec_models ] , models for cluster deposition",
    "are introduced .",
    "these models can also be useful for _ atomic _ deposition in some simple cases , namely when aggregation is irreversible .",
    "the models are adapted here to the physics of _ cluster _ deposition . in this case ,",
    "reevaporation from the substrate can be important ( as opposed to the usual conditions of molecular beam epitaxy ) , cluster - cluster aggregation is always irreversible ( as opposed to the possibility of bond breaking for atoms @xcite ) and particle - particle _ coalescence _ is possible . after a brief presentation of kinetic monte - carlo ( kmc ) simulations ,",
    "i show how the submonolayer regime can be studied in a wide variety of experimental situations : complete condensation , growth with reevaporation , nucleation on defects , formation of two and three dimensional islands  since i want these models to be useful for experimentalists , section [ sec_interpret ] is entirely devoted to the presentation of a strategy on how to analyze experimental data and extract microscopic parameters such as diffusion and evaporation rates .",
    "i remind the reader that a simple software simulating all these situations is available at no cost on simple request to the author .",
    "section [ exps ] analyzes in detail several experiments of cluster deposition .",
    "these studies serve as examples of the recipes given in section [ sec_interpret ] to analyze the data and also to demonstrate that clusters can have surprisingly large mobilities ( comparable to atomic mobilities ) on some substrates . a first interpretation of these intriguing results at the atomic level is given in section [ sec_atomic ] , where the kinetics of cluster - cluster coalescence is also studied .",
    "the main results of this section are that high cluster mobilities can be achieved provided the cluster does not find an epitaxial arrangement on the substrate and that cluster - cluster coalescence can be much slower than predicted by macroscopic theories .    a note on terminology : the structures formed on the surface by aggregation of the clusters are called islands .",
    "this is to avoid the possible confusion with the terms usually employed for atomic deposition where the clusters are the islands formed by aggregation of atoms on the surface . here",
    ", the clusters are _ preformed _ in the gas phase _ before _",
    "i use _ coverage _ for the actual portion of the surface covered by the islands and _ thickness _ for the total amount of matter deposited on the surface ( see also table i ) .",
    "before turning to the heart of this paper - the growth of nanostructures by cluster deposition - i think it is appropriate to show why one wants to obtain nanostructures at all and how these can be prepared experimentally .",
    "due to the technological impetus , a tremendous amount of both experimental and theoretical work has been carried out in this field , and it is impossible to summarize every aspect of it here . for a recent and rather thorough review ,",
    "@xcite where the possible technological impact of nanostructures is also addressed .",
    "actually , several journals are entirely devoted to this field @xcite .",
    "the reader is also referred to the enormous number of world wide web pages ( about 6000 on nanostructures ) , especially those quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite . a short summary of the industrial interest of nanostructures @xcite and introductory reviews on the interest of `` nanoscale and ultrafast devices '' @xcite or `` optics of nanostructures '' @xcite",
    "have appeared recently .",
    "there are two distinct ( though related ) domains where nanostructures can be interesting for applications .",
    "the first stems from the desire of miniaturization of electronic devices .",
    "specifically , one would like to grow organized nanometer size islands with specific electronic properties . as a consequence ,",
    "an impressive quantity of deposition techniques have been developed to grow carefully controlled thin films and nanostructures from atomic deposition @xcite .",
    "while most of these techniques are complex and keyed to specific applications , molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) @xcite has received much attention from the physicists @xcite , mainly because of its ( relative ) simplicity .",
    "the second subfield is that of nanostructured materials @xcite , as thin or thick films , which show ( mechanical , catalytic , optical ) properties different from their microcrystalline counterparts @xcite .",
    "i will now briefly review the two subfields since cluster deposition can be used to build both types of nanostructures .",
    "moreover , some of the physical processes studied below ( such as cluster - cluster coalescence ) are of interest for both types of structure .",
    "there has been a growing interest for the fabrication of organized islands of nanometer dimensions .",
    "one of the reasons is the obvious advantage of miniaturizing the electronic devices both for device speed and density on a chip ( for a simple and enjoyable introduction to the progressive miniaturization of electronics devices , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . but",
    "it should be noted that at these scales , shrinking the size of the devices does also change their properties , owing to quantun confinement effects .",
    "specifically , semiconductor islands smaller than the bohr diameter of the bulk material ( from several nm to several tens of nm ) show interesting properties : as their size decreases , their effective bandgap increases .",
    "the possiblity to tailor the electronic properties of a given material by playing on its size has generated a high level of interest in the field of these _ quantum dots _",
    "but quantum dots are not the only driving force for obtaining organized nanoislands .",
    "isolated nanoparticles are also interesting as model catalysts ( see refs . @xcite and chapter 12 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . clearly",
    ", using small particles increases the specific catalytic area for a given volume .",
    "more interesting , particles smaller than 4 - 5 nm in diameter might show specific catalytic properties , different from the bulk @xcite , although the precise mechanisms are not always well identified ( chapter 12 of ref .",
    "one possibility is the increase , for small particle sizes , of the proportion of low coordination atoms ( corners , kinks ) whose electronic ( and therefore catalytic ) properties are expected to be different from bulk atoms . for even smaller particles ( 1 - 2 nm ) , the interaction with the substrate can significantly alter their electronic properties @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been attempts at _ organizing _ the isolated islands to test the consequences on the catalytic properties @xcite . obtaining isolated clusters on a surface can also be interesting to study their properties .",
    "for example , schaefer et al .",
    "@xcite have obtained isolated gold clusters onto a variety of substrates to investigate the elastic properties of _ single _ nanoparticles by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) .",
    "let me now briefly turn on to the the possible ways of obtaining such organized nanoislands .",
    "deposition of atoms on carefully controlled substrates is the main technique used presently by physicists to try to obtain a periodic array of nanometer islands of well - defined sizes .",
    "a striking example @xcite of organized nanoislands is given in fig .",
    "[ triangles ] .",
    "these triangular islands have been grown on the dislocation network formed by the second ag atomic layer on pt(111 ) .",
    "beautiful as these triangles are , they have to be formed by nucleation and growth on the substrate , and therefore the process is highly dependent on the interaction of the adatoms with the substrate ( energy barriers for diffusion , possibility of exchange of adatoms and substrate atoms ,  ) .",
    "this drastically limits the range of possible materials that can be grown by this method .",
    "however , the growth of strained islands by heteroepitaxy is under active study , since stress is a force which can lead to order , and even a tunable order , as observed for example in the system @xmath0 @xcite ( see refs . @xcite for further details on stress ) .    in this review",
    ", i will focus on an alternative approach to form nanoislands on substrates : instead of growing them by atom - atom aggregation _ on _ the substrate , a process which dramatically depends on the idiosyncrasies of the substrate and its interaction with the deposited atoms , one can prepare the islands ( as free clusters ) _ before _ deposition and then deposit them .",
    "it should be noted that the cluster structure can be extensively characterized _ prior to _ deposition by several in - flight techniques such as time - of - flight spectrometry , photo - ionization or fragmentation @xcite .",
    "moreover , the properties of these building blocks can be adjusted by changing their _ size _ , which also affects the growth mechanisms , and therefore the film morphology @xcite . a clear example of the possibility to change the film morphology by varying only the mean cluster size has been given a few years ago by fuchs et al .",
    "@xcite ( fig .",
    "[ sbfuchs ] ) and this study has been completed recently by brechignac s group for larger cluster sizes @xcite .",
    "there are several additional interests for depositing clusters .",
    "first , these are grown in extreme nonequilibrium conditions , which allows to obtain metastable structures or alloys .",
    "it is true that neither islands grown on a substrate are generally in equilibrium , but the quenching rate is very high in a beam , and the method is more flexible since one avoids the effects of nucleation and growth on a specific substrate .",
    "for example , pdpt alloy clusters - which are known to have interesting catalytic properties - can be prepared with a precise composition ( corresponding to the composition of the target rod , see below ) and variable size and then deposited on a surface @xcite . the same is true for sic clusters where one can modify the electronic properties of the famous @xmath1 clusters by introducing in a controlled way si atoms before deposition @xcite .",
    "this allows to tune within a certain range the properties of the films by choosing the preparation conditions of the preformed clusters .",
    "it might also be anticipated that cluster nucleation is less sensitive to impurities than atomic nucleation .",
    "atomic island growth can be dramatically affected by them , as exemplified by the celebrated case of the different morphologies of pt islands grown on pt(111 ) @xcite which were actually the result of co contamination at an incredibly low level : @xmath2 mbar @xcite .",
    "instead , clusters , being larger entities , might interact less specifically with the substrate and its impurities .",
    "there is still no systematic way of organizing the clusters on a surface .",
    "one could try to pin them on selected sites such as defects or to encapsulate the clusters with organic molecules before deposition in order to obtain ordered arrays on a substrate @xcite .",
    "although my main focus in this review is the understanding of the first stages of growth , it is worth pointing out the interest of thicker nanostructured films ( for a recent review of this field , see ref .",
    "it is known @xcite that the ( magnetic , optical and mechanical ) properties of these films can be intrinsically different from their macrocrystalline counterparts .",
    "the precise reasons for this are currently being investigated , but one can cite the presence of a significant fraction ( more than 10 % ) of atoms in configurations different from the bulk configuration , for example in grain boundaries @xcite . it is reasonable to suppose that both dislocation generation and mobility may become significantly difficult in nanostructured films @xcite .",
    "for example , recent studies of the mechanical deformation properties of nanocrystalline copper @xcite have shown that high strain can be reached before the appearance of plastic deformation .",
    "a review of the effects of nanostructuration on the mechanical response of solids is given by weertman and averback in chapter 13 of ref .",
    "another interesting property of these materials is that their crystalline order is intermediate between that of the amorphous materials ( first neighbor order ) and of crystalline materials ( long range order ) .",
    "it is given by the size of the crystalline cluster , which can be tuned .",
    "for example , for random magnetic materials , by varying the size of the clusters , and consequently of the ferromagnetic domain , one can study the models of amorphous magnetic solids @xcite .",
    "after detailing the potential interests of nanostructures , i now address the practical preparation methods by _ cluster _",
    "two main variants have been explored .",
    "historically , the first idea has been to produce beams of _ accelerated _ ( ionized ) clusters and take advantage of the incident kinetic energy to enhance atomic mobility even at low substrate temperatures .",
    "this method does not lead in general to nanostructured materials , but to films similar to those obtained by atomic deposition , with sometimes better properties .",
    "a more recent approach is to deposit neutral clusters , with _",
    "low energy _ to preserve their peculiar properties when they reach the surface .",
    "the limit between the two methods is roughly at a kinetic energy of 0.1 to 1 ev / atom .",
    "the japanese group of kyoto university was the first to explore the idea of depositing clusters with high kinetic energies ( typically a few kev ) to form thin films @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the ionized cluster beam ( icb ) technique is that the cluster breaks upon arrival and its kinetic energy is transferred to the adatoms which then have high lateral ( i.e. parallel to the substrate ) mobilities on the surface .",
    "this allows in principle to achieve epitaxy at low substrate temperatures , which is interesting to avoid diffusion at interfaces or other activated processes .",
    "several examples of good epitaxy by icb have been obtained by kyoto s group : al / si @xcite which has a large mismatch and many other couples of metals and ceramics on various crystalline substrates such as si(100 ) , si(111 )  molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have supported this idea of epitaxy by cluster spreading @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to yamada s reviews @xcite for an exhaustive list of icb applications , which also includes high energy density bombardment of surfaces to achieve sputter yields significantly higher than obtained from atomic bombardment @xcite .",
    "however , the physics behind these technological successes is not clear .",
    "in fact , the very presence of a significant fraction of large clusters in the beam seems dubious @xcite .",
    "there is some experimental evidence @xcite offered by kyoto s group to support the effective presence of a significant fraction of large clusters in the beam , but the evidence is not conclusive . in short , it is difficult to make a definite judgement about the icb technique .",
    "there is no clear proof of the presence of clusters in the beam and the high energy of the incident particles renders difficult any attempt of modelling .",
    "kyoto s group has clearly shown that icb does lead to good quality films in many cases but it is not clear how systematic the improvement is when compared to atomic deposition techniques .",
    "haberland s group in freiburg has developed recently a different technique called energetic cluster impact ( eci ) where a better controlled beam of energetic clusters is deposited on surfaces @xcite .",
    "freiburg s group has shown that accelerating the clusters leads to improvements in some properties of the films : depositing slow clusters ( energy per atom 0.1 ev ) produces metal films which can be wiped off easily , but accelerating them before deposition ( up to 10 ev per atom ) results in strongly adhering films @xcite .",
    "md simulations of cluster deposition @xcite have explained qualitatively this behavior : while low energetic clusters tend to pile up on the substrate leaving large cavities , energetic clusters lead to a compact film ( fig .",
    "[ md_eci ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that , even for the highest energies explored in the md simulations ( 10 ev per atom ) , no atoms were ejected form the cluster upon impact .",
    "the effect of film smoothening is only due to the flattening of the cluster when it touches the substrate . some caution on the interpretation of these simulations in needed because of the very short time scales which can be simulated ( some ps ) . similar md simulations of the impact of a cluster with a surface at higher energies have also been performed @xcite .",
    "recently , palmer s group @xcite has studied the interaction of ag clusters on graphite for various incident kinetic energies ( between 15 and 1500 ev ) .",
    "they have shown that , for _ small _ ( @xmath3 ) clusters , the probability of a cluster penetrating the substrate or not critically depends on its orientation relative to the substrate .",
    "another strategy to grow nanostructures with cluster beams consists in depositing _ low energy _",
    "particles @xcite . ideally , by depositing the clusters with low kinetic energies",
    ", one would like to conserve the memory of the free cluster phase @xcite to form thin films with original properties .",
    "since the kinetic energy is of the order of 10 ev per cluster @xcite , i.e. a few mev per atom which is negligible compared to the binding energy of an atom in the cluster , no fragmentation of the clusters is expected upon impact on the substrate .",
    "[ md_eci ] suggests that the films are porous @xcite , which is interesting to keep one of the peculiarities of the clusters : their high surface / volume ratio which affects all the physical ( structural , electronic ) properties as well as the chemical reactivity ( catalysis ) .",
    "concerning deposition of carbon clusters , experiments @xcite as well as simulations @xcite have shown that the carbon clusters preserve their identity in the thick film .",
    "another interesting type of nanostructured film grown by cluster deposition is the growth of cermets by combining a cluster beam with an atomic beam of the encapsulating material @xcite .",
    "the point is that the size of the metallic particles is determined by the incident cluster size and the concentration by the ratio of the two fluxes .",
    "then , these two crucial parameters can be varied independently , in contrast to the cermets grown from atomic beams and precipitation upon annealing .",
    "cluster beams are generated by different techniques : multiple expansion cluster source ( mecs , @xcite ) , gas - aggregation @xcite  all these techniques produce a beam of clusters with a distribution of sizes , with a dispersion of about half the mean size . for simplicity , i will always refer to this mean size . in gas - aggregation techniques , an atomic vapor obtained from a heated crucible",
    "is mixed with an inert gas ( usually ar or he ) and the two are cooled by adiabatic expansion , resulting in supersaturation and cluster formation .",
    "the mean cluster size can be monitored by the different source parameters ( such as the inert gas pressure ) and can be measured by a time of flight mass spectrometer . for further experimental details on this technique , see refs .",
    "@xcite . to produce clusters of refractory materials ,",
    "a different evaporation technique is needed : laser vaporization @xcite .",
    "a plasma created by the impact of a laser beam focused on a rod of is thermalized by injection of a high pressure he - pulse ( typically , 3 - 5 bars during 150 to 300 @xmath4s ) , which permits the cluster growth .",
    "the mean cluster size is governed by several parameters such as the helium flow , the laser power and the delay time between the laser shot and the helium pulse . as a consequence of the pulsed laser shot ,",
    "the cluster flux reaching the surface is not continuous but _",
    "chopped_. typical values for the chopping parameters are : active portion of the period @xmath5 and chopping frequency @xmath6 .      alternatively , one can deposit accelerated clusters onto a buffer layer which acts as a `` mattress '' to dissipate the kinetic energy . this layer is then evaporated , which leads to cluster soft - landing onto the substrate @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it is possible to select the mass of the ionized clusters before deposition .",
    "however , it is difficult with this technique to reach high enough deposition rates to grow films in reasonable times .",
    "vitomirov et al @xcite deposited _ atoms _ onto a rare - gas buffer layer : the atoms first clustered on top and within the layer which was afterwards evaporated , allowing the clusters to reach the substrate .",
    "finally , deposition of clusters from a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) tip has been shown to be possible , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "i describe in this section simple models which allow to understand the first stages of film growth by low energy cluster deposition",
    ". these models can also be useful for understanding the growth of islands from _ atomic _ beams in the submonolayer regime in _ simple _ cases , namely ( almost ) perfect substrates , irreversible aggregation , etc .",
    "and they have allowed to understand and quantify many aspects of the growth : for a review of analysis of atomic deposition with this kind of models , see refs .",
    "the models described below are similar to previous models of diffusing particles that aggregate , but such `` cluster - cluster aggregation '' ( cca ) models @xcite do not incorporate the possibility of continual injection of new particles via deposition , an essential ingredient for thin film growth .    given an experimental system ( substrate and cluster chemical nature ) , how can one predict the growth characteristics for a given set of parameters ( substrate temperature , incoming flux of clusters  ) ?",
    "a first idea - the `` brute - force '' approach - would be to run a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation with ab - initio potentials for the particular system one wants to study . it should be clear that such an approach is bound to fail since the calculation time is far too large for present - day computers .",
    "even using empirical potentials ( such as lennard - jones , embedded atom or tight - binding ) will not do because there is an intrinsically large time scale in the growth problem : the mean time needed to fill a significant fraction of the substrate with the incident particles .",
    "an estimate of this time is fixed by @xmath7 , the time needed to fill a monolayer : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the particle flux expressed in monolayers per second ( ml / s ) .",
    "typically , the experimental values of the flux are lower than 1ml / s , leading to @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , there is a time span of about 13 decades between the typical vibration time ( @xmath11 , the lower time scale for the simulations ) and @xmath7 , rendering hopeless any `` brute - force '' approach .",
    "there is a rigorous way @xcite of circumventing this time span problem : the idea is to `` coarsen '' the description by defining _ elementary processes _ , an approach somewhat reminiscent of the usual ( length , energy ) renormalization of particle physics @xcite .",
    "one `` sums up '' all the short time processes ( typically , atomic thermal vibrations ) in effective parameters ( transition rates ) valid for a higher level ( longer time ) description .",
    "i will now briefly describe this rigorous approach and then proceed to show how it can be adapted to cluster deposition .",
    "voter @xcite showed that the interatomic potential for any system can be translated into a finite set of parameters , which then provides the exact dynamic evolution of the system .",
    "recently , the same idea has been applied to lennard - jones potentials @xcite by using only _ two _ parameters .",
    "the point is that these coarse - grained , lattice - gas approach needs orders of magnitude less computer power than the md dynamics described above .",
    "one can understand the basic idea by the following simple example : for the md description of the diffusion of an atom by hopping , one has to follow in detail its motion at the picosecond scale , where the atom mainly oscillates in the bottom of its potential well . only rarely at this time scale",
    "will the atom jump from site to site , which is what one is interested on .",
    "voter showed that , provided some conditions are met concerning the separation of these two time scales , and restricting the motion to a regular ( discrete ) lattice ( see @xcite for more details ) , one could replace this `` useless '' information by an effective parameter taking into account all the detailed motion of the atom within the well ( including the correlations between the motions of the atom and its neighbors ) and allowing a rapid evaluation of its diffusion rate .",
    "unfortunately , this rigorous approach is not useful for _ cluster _ deposition , because the number of atomic degrees of freedom ( configurations ) is too high .",
    "instead , one chooses - from physical intuition - a `` reasonable '' set of elementary processes , whose magnitudes are used as _ free parameters_. this allows to understand the role of each of these elementary processes during the growth and then to fit their value from experiments ( fig . [ kmccategories ] ) .",
    "these are the models which i will study in this paper , with precise examples of parameter fit ( see section [ exps ] ) .",
    "examples of such fits from experimental data for _ atomic _ deposition include homoepitaxial growth of gaas(001 ) @xcite , of pt(100 ) @xcite or several metal(100 ) surfaces @xcite . of course , fitting is not very reliable when there are too many ( almost free ) parameters .",
    "an interesting alternative are intermediate cases , where parameters are determined from known potentials but with a simplified fitting procedure taking into account what is known experimentally of the system under study : see ref .",
    "@xcite for a clear example of such a possibility .      to be able to adjust the values of the elementary processes from experiments",
    ", one must first predict the growth from these processes . the oldest way",
    "is to write `` rate - equations '' which describe in a mean - field way the effect of these processes on the number of isolated particles moving on the substrate ( called monomers ) and islands of a given size .",
    "the first author to attempt such an approach for growth was zinsmeister @xcite in 1966 , but the general approach is similar to the rate - equations first used by smoluchovsky for particle aggregation @xcite . in the seventies ,",
    "many papers dealing with better mean - field approximations and applications of these equations to interpret experimental systems were published .",
    "the reader is referred to the classical reviews by venables and co - workers @xcite and stoyanov and kaschiev @xcite for more details on this approach .",
    "more recently , there have been two interesting improvements .",
    "the first is by villain and co - workers which have simplified enormously the mathematical treatment of the rate - equations , allowing one to understand easily the results obtained in a variety of cases @xcite .",
    "pimpinelli et al .",
    "have recently published a summary of the application of this simplified treatment to many practical situations using a unified approach @xcite .",
    "the second improvement is due to bales and chrzan @xcite who have developed a more sophisticated self - consistent rate - equations approach which gives better results and allows to justify many of the approximations made in the past .",
    "however , these analytical approaches are mean - field in nature and can not reproduce all the characteristics of the growth .",
    "two known examples are the island morphology and the island size distribution @xcite .",
    "the alternative approach to predict the growth are kinetic monte - carlo ( kmc ) simulations .",
    "kmc simulations are an extension of the usual monte carlo @xcite algorithm and provide a rigorous way of calculating the dynamical evolution of a complicated system where a large but _ finite _ number of random processes occur at given rates .",
    "kmc simulations are useful when one chooses to deal with only the slowest degrees of freedom of a system , these variables being only weakly coupled to the fast ones , which act as a heat bath @xcite . the `` coarsened '' description of film growth ( basically , diffusion ) given above is a good example @xcite , but other applications @xcite of kmc simulations include interdiffusion in alloys , slow phase separations  the principle of kmc simulations is straightforward : one uses a list of all the possible processes together with their respective rates @xmath12 and generates the time evolution of the system from these processes taking into account the random character of the evolution . for the simple models of film growth described below , systems containing up to 4000",
    "x 4000 lattice sites can be simulated in a reasonable time ( a few hours ) , which limits the finite size effects usually observed in this kind of simulation .",
    "let me now discuss in some detail the way kmc simulations are implemented to reproduce the growth , once a set of processes has been defined , with their respective @xmath12 taking arbitrary values or being derived from known potentials .",
    "there are two main points to discuss here : the physical correctness of the dynamics and the calculation speed .",
    "concerning the first point , it should be noted that , originally @xcite , monte carlo simulations aimed at the description of the _ equations of state _ of a system .",
    "then , `` the mc method performs a ' ' time `` averaging of a model with ( often artificial ) stochastic kinetics [ ... ] : time plays the role of a label characterizing the sequential order of states , and need not be related to the physical times '' @xcite .",
    "one should be cautious therefore on the precise monte carlo scheme used for the simulation when attempting at describing the kinetics of a system , as in kmc simulations .",
    "for example , there are doubts @xcite about some simulation work @xcite carried out using kawasaki dynamics .",
    "this point is discussed in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let me address now the important problem of the calculation speed .",
    "one could naively think of choosing a time interval @xmath13 smaller than all the relevant times in the problem , and then repeat the following procedure :    \\(1 ) choose one particle randomly    \\(2 ) choose randomly one of the possible processes for this particle    \\(3 ) calculate the probability @xmath14 of this process happening during the time interval @xmath13 ( @xmath15 )    \\(4 ) throw a random number @xmath16 and compare it with @xmath14 : if @xmath17 perform the process , if not go to the next step    \\(5 ) increase the time by @xmath13 and goto ( 1 )    this procedure leads to the correct kinetic evolution of the system but might be extremely slow if there is a large range of probabilities @xmath14 for the different processes ( and therefore some @xmath18 ) .",
    "the reason is that a significant fraction of the loops leads to rejected moves , i.e. to no evolution at all of the system .    instead , bortz et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a clever approach to eliminate _ all _ the rejected moves and thus reduce dramatically the computational times .",
    "the point is to choose not the particles but the _ processes _ , according to their respective rate and the number of possible ways of performing this process ( called @xmath19 ) .",
    "this procedure can be represented schematically as follows :    \\(1 ) update the list of the possible ways of performing the processes @xmath19    \\(2 ) randomly select one of the process , _ weighting _",
    "the probability of selection by the process rate @xmath12 and @xmath19 : @xmath20    \\(3 ) randomly select a particle for performing this process    \\(4 ) move the particle    \\(5 ) increase the time by @xmath21    \\(6 ) goto ( 1 )    a specific example of such a scheme for cluster deposition is given below ( section [ basic_clu ] ) .",
    "note that the new procedure implies a less intuitive increment of time , and that one has to create ( and update ) a list of all the @xmath19 constantly , but the acceleration of the calculations is worth the effort .",
    "a serious limitation of kmc approaches is that one has to assume a finite number of local environments ( to obtain a finite number of parameters ) : this confines kmc approaches to regular lattices , thus preventing a rigorous consideration of elastic relaxation , stress effects  everything that affects not only the _ number _ of first or second nearest neighbors but also their precise position . indeed , considering the precise position as in md simulations introduces a _ continuous _ variable and leads to an infinite number of possible configurations or processes .",
    "stress effects can be introduced approximately in kmc simulations , for example @xcite by allowing a variation of the bonding energy of an atom to an island as a function of the island size ( the stress depending on the size ) , but it is unclear how meaningful these approaches are ( see also refs .",
    "i should quote here a recent proposition @xcite inspired on the old frenkel - kontorova model @xcite which allows to incorporate some misfit effects in rapid simulations .",
    "it remains to explore whether such an approach could be adapted to the kmc scheme .",
    "what is likely to occur when clusters are deposited on a surface ?",
    "i will present here the elementary processes which will be used in cluster deposition models : deposition , diffusion and evaporation of the clusters and their interaction on the surface ( figs .",
    "[ dda ] and [ interaction ] ) .",
    "the influence of surface defects which could act as traps for the particles is also addressed .",
    "a simple physical rationale for choosing only a limited set of parameters is the following ( see fig .",
    "[ timescale ] ) . for any given system",
    ", there will be a `` hierarchy '' of time scales , and the relevant ones for a growth experiment are those much lower than @xmath8 .",
    "the others are too slow to act and can be neglected .",
    "the hierarchy of time scales ( and therefore the relevant processes ) depend of course on the precise system under study .",
    "it should be noted that for _ cluster _ deposition the situation is somewhat simpler than for atom deposition @xcite since many elementary processes are very slow .",
    "for example , diffusion of clusters on top of an already formed island is very low @xcite , cluster detachment from the islands is insignificant and edge diffusion is not an elementary process at all since the cluster can not move as an entity over the island edge ( as i will discuss in section [ sec_coale ] , the equivalent process is cluster - cluster coalescence by atomic motion ) .",
    "let me now discuss in detail each of the elementary processes useful for cluster deposition .",
    "the first ingredient of the growth , _ deposition _ , is quantified by the flux @xmath9 , i.e. the number of clusters that are deposited on the surface per unit area and unit time .",
    "the flux is usually uniform in time , but in some experimental situations it can be pulsed , i.e. change from a constant value to 0 over a given period .",
    "chopping the flux can affect the growth of the film significantly @xcite , and i will take this into account when needed ( section [ fhach ] ) .",
    "the second ingredient is the _ diffusion _ of the clusters which have reached the substrate .",
    "i assume that the diffusion is brownian , i.e. the particle undergoes a random walk on the substrate . to quantify the diffusion , one can use both the usual diffusion coefficient @xmath22 or the diffusion time @xmath23 , i.e. the time needed by a cluster to move by one diameter .",
    "these two quantities are connected by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the diameter of the cluster .",
    "experiments show that the diffusion coefficient of a cluster can be surprisingly large , comparable to the atomic diffusion coefficients .",
    "the diffusion is here supposed to occur on a perfect substrate .",
    "real surfaces always present some defects such as steps , vacancies or adsorbed chemical impurities .",
    "the presence of these defects on the surface could significantly alter the diffusion of the particles and therefore the growth of the film .",
    "i will include here one simple kind of defect , a perfect trap for the clusters which definitively prevents them from moving .    a third process which could be present in growth is _ re - evaporation _ of the clusters from the substrate after a time @xmath26 .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath27 the mean diffusion length on the substrate before desorption .    the last simple process i will consider is the _ interaction _ between the clusters .",
    "the simplest case is when aggregation is irreversible and particles simply remain juxtaposed upon contact .",
    "this occurs at low temperatures . at higher temperatures",
    ", cluster - cluster coalescence will be active ( fig .",
    "[ interaction ] ) .",
    "thermodynamics teaches us that coalescence should always happen but without specifying the kinetics . since",
    "many clusters are deposited on the surface per unit time , kinetics is here crucial to determine the shape of the islands formed on the substrate .",
    "a total comprehension of the kinetics is still lacking , for reasons that i will discuss later ( section [ sec_coale ] ) .",
    "i note that the shape of the clusters and the islands on the surface need not be perfectly spherical , even in the case of total coalescence .",
    "their interaction with the substrate can lead to half spheres or even flatter shapes depending on the contact angle .",
    "contrary to what happens for atomic deposition , a cluster touching an island forms a huge number of atom - atom bonds and will not detach from it .",
    "thus , models including _ reversible _ particle - particle aggregation @xcite are not useful for cluster deposition .    the specific procedure to perform a rapid kmc simulation of a system ( linear size l ) when deposition , diffusion and evaporation of the monomers are included is the following .",
    "the processes are : deposition of a particle ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( it is possible to deposit a particle on each site of the lattice ) ) , diffusion of a monomer ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the monomer density on the surface ) and evaporation of a monomer ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) . for each loop ,",
    "one calculates two quantities @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "then , one throws a random number p ( @xmath37 ) and compare it to @xmath38 and @xmath39 . if @xmath40 , a particle is deposited in a random position ; if @xmath41 , a monomer ( randomly selected ) is removed , otherwise we just move a randomly chosen monomer . after each of these possibilities ,",
    "one checks whether an aggregation has taken place ( which modifies the number of monomers on the surface , and therefore the number of possible diffusion or evaporation moves ) , increase the time by @xmath42 and go to the next loop .",
    "the usual game for theoreticians is to combine these elementary processes and predict the growth of the film .",
    "however , experimentalists are interested in the reverse strategy : from ( a set of ) experimental results , they wish to understand which elementary processes are actually present in their growth experiments and what are the magnitudes of each of them , what physicists call understanding a phenomenon .",
    "the problem , of course , is that with so many processes , many combinations will reproduce the same experiments ( see specific examples below ) .",
    "then , some clever guesses are needed to first identify which processes are present .",
    "for example , if the saturation island density does not change when flux ( or substrate temperature ) is changed , one can guess that nucleation is mostly occurring on defects of the surface .    in view of these difficulties",
    ", next section is devoted to predict the growth when the microscopic processes ( and their values ) are known .",
    "after , in section [ sec_interpret ] , i propose a detailed procedure to identify and quantify the microscopic process from the experiments .",
    "finally , section [ exps ] reviews the experimental results obtained for cluster deposition .",
    "the scope of this section is to find formulas or graphs to deduce the values of the microscopic processes ( diffusion , evaporation  ) from the observed experimental quantities ( island density , island size histograms  ) .",
    "the `` classical '' studies @xcite have focused on the evolution of the concentration of islands on the surface as a function of time , and especially on the saturation island density , i.e. the maximum of the island density observed before reaching a continuous film .",
    "the reason is of course the double possibility to calculate it from rate - equations and to measure it experimentally by conventional microscopy .",
    "i will show other interesting quantities such as island size distributions which are measurable experimentally and have been recently calculated by computer simulations @xcite .",
    "i will study the two limiting cases of pure juxtaposition and total coalescence ( which are similar to two and three dimensional growth in atomic deposition terminology ) separately .",
    "experimentally , the distinction between the two cases can be made by looking at the shape of the supported islands : if they are circular ( and larger than the incident clusters ) they have been formed by total coalescence ; if ramified by pure juxtaposition ( see several examples below , section [ exps ] ) .    in both cases ,",
    "i analyze how the growth proceeds when different processes are at work : diffusion , evaporation , defects acting as traps , island mobility  in the simulations , i often take the diffusion time @xmath23 to be the unit time : in this case , the flux is equivalent to the normalized flux @xmath43 ( see the table ) and the evaporation time corresponds to @xmath44 .",
    "the growth is characterized by the kinetics of island formation , the value of the island concentration at saturation @xmath45 ( i.e. the maximum value reached before island - island coalescence becomes important ) and the corresponding values of the thickness @xmath46 and condensation coefficient @xmath47 , useful when evaporation is important ( the condensation coefficient is the ratio of matter actually present on the substrate over the the total number of particles sent on the surface ( also called the thickness @xmath48 ) , see table i ) .",
    "i also give the island size distributions corresponding to each growth hypothesis .",
    "these have proven useful as a tool for experimentalists to distinguish between different growth mechanisms @xcite . by _",
    "size _ of an island , i mean the surface it occupies on the substrate . for `` two dimensional '' islands ( i.e. formed by pure juxtaposition ) ,",
    "this is the same as the island mass , i.e. its number of monomers . for `` three dimensional '' islands ( formed by total coalescence )",
    ", their projected surface is the easiest quantity to measure by microscopy .",
    "it should be noted that for three dimensional islands , their projected surface for a given mass depends on their shape , which is assumed here to be pyramidal ( close to a half - sphere ) .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that by normalizing the size histograms , one obtains a `` universal '' size distribution independent of the coverage , the flux or the substrate temperature for a large range of their values .",
    "i first study the formation of the islands in the limiting case of pure juxtaposition .",
    "this is done for several growth hypothesis .",
    "the rate - equations treatment is given in appendix a.      let me start with the simplest case where only diffusion takes place on a perfect substrate ( no evaporation ) .",
    "fig  [ dent]a shows the evolution of the monomer ( i.e. isolated clusters ) and island densities as a function of deposition time .    we see that the monomer density rapidly grows , leading to a rapid increase of island density by monomer - monomer encounter on the surface .",
    "this goes on until the islands occupy a small fraction of the surface , roughly 0.1% ( fig .",
    "[ morpho]a ) .",
    "then , islands capture efficiently the monomers , whose density decreases . as a consequence",
    ", it becomes less probable to create more islands , and their number increases more slowly . when the coverage reaches a value close to 15% ( fig .",
    "[ morpho]b ) , coalescence will start to decrease the number of islands .",
    "the maximum number of islands at saturation @xmath45 is thus reached for coverages around 15% . concerning the dependence of @xmath45 as a function of the model parameters , it has been shown that the maximum number of islands per unit area formed on the surface scales as @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "recent simulations @xcite and theoretical analysis @xcite have shown that the precise relation is @xmath50 for the _ ramified _ islands produced by pure juxtaposition ( fig .",
    "[ nmax2d ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that if cluster diffusion is vanishingly small , the above relation does not hold : instead , film growth proceeds as in the percolation model @xcite , by random paving of the substrate .",
    "an experimental example of such a situation has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "what happens when evaporation is also included ?",
    "fig  [ dent]b shows that now the monomer density becomes roughly a _ constant _ , since it is now mainly determined by the balancing of deposition and evaporation .",
    "as expected , the constant concentration equals @xmath51 ( solid line )",
    ". then the number of islands increases linearly with time ( the island creation rate is roughly proportional to the square monomer concentration , see appendix a ) .",
    "one can also notice that only a small fraction ( 1/100 ) of the monomers do effectively remain on the substrate , as shown by the low condensation coefficient value at early times .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the islands grow by capturing only the monomers that are deposited within their `` capture zone '' ( comprised between two circles of radius @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "the other monomers evaporate before reaching the islands .",
    "when the islands occupy a significant fraction of the surface , they capture rapidly the monomers .",
    "this has two effects : the monomer density starts to decrease , and the condensation coefficient starts to increase .",
    "shortly after , the island density saturates and starts to decrease because of island - island coalescence .",
    "[ nmax2d ] shows the evolution of the maximum island density in the presence of evaporation .",
    "a detailed analysis of the effect of monomer evaporation on the growth is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where is also discussed the regime of `` direct impingement '' which arises when @xmath54 : islands are formed by _ direct impingement _ of incident clusters as first neighbors of previously adsorbed clusters , and grow by direct impingement of clusters on the island boundary .",
    "a summary of the results obtained in the various regimes spanned as the evaporation time @xmath26 decreases is given in appendix a.      i briefly treat now the influence of a very simple kind of defect : a perfect trap for the diffusing particles .",
    "if a particle enters such a defect site , it becomes trapped at this site forever . if such defects are present on the surface @xcite they will affect the growth of the film only if their number is higher than the number of islands that would have been created without defects ( for the same values of the parameters ) .",
    "if this is indeed the case , monomers will be trapped by the defects at the very beginning of the growth and the number of islands equates the number of defects , whatever the diffusivity of the particles .",
    "the kinetics of island formation is dramatically affected by the presence of defects , the saturation density being reached almost immediately ( fig .",
    "[ cinetns ] ) .",
    "the consequences of the mobility of small islands have not received much attention .",
    "one reason is that it is difficult to include island mobility in rate equations treatments .",
    "a different ( though related ! ) reason is that ( atomic ) islands are expected to be almost immobile in most homoepitaxial systems .",
    "however , several studies have shown the following consequences of island mobility for the pure juxtaposition case and in the absence of evaporation .",
    "first , the saturation island density is changed @xcite : one obtains @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ nmax2d ] ) if all islands are mobile , with a mobility inversely proportional to their size @xcite .",
    "second , the saturation island density is reached for very low coverages ( fig .",
    "[ cinetns ] and ref .",
    "this can be explained by a dynamical equilibrium between island formation and coalescence taking place at low coverages thanks to island diffusion .",
    "if only monomers are able to move , islands can coalesce ( static coalescence ) only when the coverage is high enough ( roughly 10 - 15% , @xcite ) .",
    "then , the saturation island density is reached in this case for those coverages .",
    "instead , when islands can move , the so called dynamical coalescence starts from the beginning of the growth and the balance is established at very low coverages @xcite .",
    "third , the island size distribution is sharpened by the mobility of the islands @xcite . to my knowledge",
    ", there is no prediction concerning the growth of films with evaporation when islands are mobile .",
    "fig  [ distrib2d ] shows the evolution of the _ rescaled _",
    "@xcite island size distributions as a function of the evaporation time for islands formed by juxtaposition @xcite .",
    "size distributions are normalized by the mean island size in the following way : one defines @xmath56 as the probability that a randomly chosen island has a surface @xmath57 when the average surface per island is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 stands for the number of islands of surface @xmath57 , @xmath60 is the total number of islands and @xmath61 for the coverage of the surface .",
    "it is clear that the distributions are significantly affected by the evaporation , smaller islands becoming more numerous when evaporation increases .",
    "this trend can be qualitatively understood by noting that new islands are created continuously when evaporation is present , while nucleation rapidly becomes negligible in the complete condensation regime .",
    "the reason is that islands are created ( spatially ) homogeneously in the last case , because the positions of the islands are correlated ( through monomer diffusion ) , leaving virtually no room for further nucleation once a small portion of the surface is covered ( @xmath62 ) . in the limit of strong evaporation",
    ", islands are nucleated randomly on the surface , the fluctuations leaving large regions of the surface uncovered .",
    "these large regions can host new islands even for relatively large coverages , which explains that there is a large proportion of small ( @xmath63 ) islands in this regime .",
    "if clusters coalesce when touching , the results are slightly different from those given in the preceding section , mainly because the islands occupy a smaller portion of the substrate at a given thickness . therefore , in the case of complete condensation for example , saturation arises at a higher thickness ( fig .",
    "[ cinetns ] ) even if the _ coverage _ is approximately the same ( matter is `` wasted '' in the dimension perpendicular to the substrate ) .",
    "however , the main qualitative characteristics of the growth correspond to those detailed in the preceding section . fig .  [ nmax3d ] shows the evolution of the maximum island density in that case , where the three - dimensional islands are assumed to be roughly half spheres ( actually , pyramids were used in these simulations which were originally intended for atomic deposition @xcite ) . the analytical results obtained from a rate - equations treatment",
    "are given in appendix b. if the islands are more spherical ( i.e. the contact angle is higher ) , a simple way to adapt these results on the kinetic evolution of island concentration ( fig .",
    "[ cinetns ] ) is to multiply the thickness by the appropriate form factor , 2 for a sphere for example . indeed ,",
    "if islands are spherical , the same coverage is obtained for a thickness double than that obtained for the case of half - spheres ( there are two identical half spheres ) .",
    "this is a slight approximation since one has to assume that the capture cross section ( which governs the growth ) is identical for the two shapes : this is not exactly true @xcite but is a very good approximation .",
    "fig  [ distrib3d ] shows the evolution of the _ rescaled _ island size distributions for three dimensional islands ( pyramids ) in presence of evaporation .",
    "i recall that size means here the projected surface of the island , a quantity which can be measured easily by electron microscopy .",
    "we note the same trends as for the pure juxtaposition case .",
    "fig  [ distribdef ] shows the evolution of the _ rescaled _ island size distributions for pyramidal islands nucleating _ on defects_. two main differences can be noted .",
    "first , the histograms are significantly narrower than in the preceding case , as had already been noted in experimental studies @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by noting that all islands are nucleated at almost the same time ( at the very beginning of growth ) .",
    "the second point is that the size distributions are sensitive to the actual coverage of the substrate , in contrast with previous cases . in other words",
    ", there is no perfect rescaling of the data obtained at different coverages , even if rescaling for different fluxes or diffusion times has been checked .",
    "i briefly address in this paragraph other processes which have not been analyzed here .",
    "a possible ( but difficult to study ) process is a long range interaction between particles ( electrostatical or through the substrate ) .",
    "there is some experimental evidence of this kind of interaction for the system au / kcl(100 ) @xcite but to my knowledge , it has never been incorporated in growth models .",
    "chemical impurities adsorbed on the substrate can change the growth in conventional vacuum , and these effects are extremely difficult to understand and control @xcite . of course",
    ", many other possible processes have not been addressed in this review , such as the influence of strain , of extended defects as steps or vacancy islands ",
    "figures  [ nmax2d ] , [ nmax3d ] constitute in some sense `` abacuses '' from which one can determine the value of the microscopic parameters ( diffusion , evaporation ) if the saturation island density is known .",
    "the problem is : does the measured island density correspond to the defect concentration of the surface or to homogeneous nucleation ? if the latter is true : which curve should be used to interpret the data ?",
    "in other words , is evaporation present in the experiments and what is the magnitude of @xmath26 ?",
    "i will now give some tricks to first find out which processes are relevant and then how they can be quantified .",
    "let s concentrate first on the presence of defects .",
    "one possibility is to look at the evolution of @xmath45 with the flux .",
    "as already explained , if this leaves unaffected the saturation density , nucleation is occurring on defects .",
    "a similar test can be performed by changing the substrate temperature , but there is the nagging possibility that this changes the defect concentration on the surface .",
    "it is also possible to study the kinetics of island nucleation , i.e. look at the island concentration as a function of thickness or coverage . the presence of defects can be detected by the fact that the maximum island density is reached at very low coverages ( typically less than 1% , see fig .",
    "[ cinetns ] ) and/or by the fact that the nucleation rate ( i.e. the derivative of the island density ) scales as the flux and not as the square flux : see section 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "one should be careful however to check that all the islands , even those containing a few particles , are visible in the microscope images . this is a delicate point for atomic deposition @xcite but should be less restrictive for clusters since each cluster has already a diameter typically larger than a nanometer .",
    "of course all this discussion assumes that the defects are of the `` ideal '' kind studied here , i.e. perfect traps . if atoms can escape from the defects after some time , the situation is changed but i am unaware of studies on this question .",
    "the question of evaporation is more delicate .",
    "first , one should check whether particle reevaporation is important . in principle , this can be done by measuring the condensation coefficient , i.e. the amount of matter present on the surface as a function of the amount of matter brought by the beam . if possible , this measure leaves no ambiguity . otherwise , the kinetics of island creation is helpful .",
    "if the saturation is reached at low thicknesses ( @xmath64 ) , this means that evaporation is not important .",
    "another way of detecting particle evaporation is by studying the evolution of the saturation island density with the flux : in the case of 2d growth ( fig .",
    "[ nmax2d ] ) , the exponent is 0.36 when evaporation is negligible but roughly 0.66 when evaporation significantly affects the growth @xcite .",
    "there are similar differences for 3d islands : the exponent changes from 0.29 to 0.66 @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ nmax3d ] ) .",
    "suppose now that one finds that evaporation is indeed important : before being able to use fig .",
    "[ nmax2d ] or fig .",
    "[ nmax3d ] , one has to know the precise value of @xmath26 . one way to find out is to make a precise fit of the kinetic evolution of the island density or the condensation coefficient ( see section [ sec_sb36 ] for an example ) . in next paragraph , i show how to find @xmath26 if one knows only the _ saturation _ values of the island density and the thickness .    as a summary , here is a possible experimental strategy to analyze the growth .",
    "first , get a series of micrographs of submonolayer films as a function of the thickness .",
    "the distinction between the pure juxtaposition and total coalescence cases can be easily made by comparing the size of the supported islands to the ( supposedly known ) size of the incident clusters .",
    "also , if the islands are spherical , this means that coalescence has taken place , if they are ramified that clusters only juxtapose upon contact . of course , all the intermediate cases are possible ( see the case of gold clusters below ) .",
    "one can calculate the ratio of deposited thickness over the coverage : if this ratio is close to 1 , islands are flat ( i.e. one cluster thick ) , otherwise three dimensional ( unless there is evaporation ) .",
    "from these micrographs , it is possible to measure the island density as a function of the thickness .",
    "[ cinetns ] should be now helpful to distinguish between the different growth mechanisms .",
    "for example , if the saturation island density is obtained for large thicknesses ( typically more than 1ml ) , then evaporation is certainly relevant and trying to measure the condensation coefficient is important to confirm this point .",
    "it is clear from figs .",
    "[ nmax2d ] , [ nmax3d ] that the knowledge of @xmath45 alone can not determine @xmath26 since many values of @xmath23 and @xmath26 can lead to the same @xmath45 . in the 2d case , the values of the microscopic parameters can be obtained by noting that the higher the evaporation rate , the higher the amount of matter `` wasted '' for film growth ( i.e. re - evaporated ) .",
    "one therefore expects that the smaller @xmath26 , the higher @xmath46 , which is confirmed by fig .",
    "[ coll2d]a .",
    "therefore , from the ( known ) value of @xmath46 , one can determine the value of the evaporation parameter @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ coll2d]a ) .",
    "once @xmath66 is known , @xmath67 is determined from fig .",
    "[ coll2d]b since @xmath45 is known .",
    "@xmath68 can afterwards be determined ( from @xmath67 and @xmath66 ) .",
    "this is only valid for @xmath69 @xcite , a condition always fulfilled in experiments .",
    "the 3d case is more difficult since the same strategy ( measuring @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) fails .",
    "the reason is that in the limit of high evaporation , @xmath46 goes as @xmath70 , thus bringing no independent information on the parameters @xcite . the same is true for the condensation coefficient at saturation @xmath47 , which is a _ constant _ , i.e. independent of the value of @xmath26 or the normalized flux ( see fig .",
    "[ coll3d]b ) .",
    "this counterintuitive result ( one would think that the higher the evaporation rate , the smaller the condensation coefficient at saturation ) can be understood by noting that _ in this limit _ ,",
    "islands only grow by direct impingement of particles within them @xcite and therefore @xmath67 ( or @xmath26 ) has no effect on the growth .",
    "fortunately , in many experimental situations , the limit of high evaporation is not reached and one `` benefits '' from ( mathematical ) crossover regimes where these quantities do depend on the precise values of @xmath26 .",
    "[ coll3d ] give the evolutions of @xmath47 and @xmath46 as a function of @xmath45 for different values of @xmath26 and f. then , knowing @xmath46 and @xmath45 leads to an estimation of @xmath26 from fig .",
    "[ coll3d]a which can be confirmed with fig .",
    "[ coll3d]b provided @xmath47 is known .    to conclude ,",
    "let me note that a saturation thickness much smaller than 1ml can also be attributed to island mobility .",
    "this is a subtle process and it is difficult to obtain any information on its importance .",
    "we note that interpreting data as not affected by island diffusion when it is actually present leads to errors on diffusion coefficients of one order of magnitude or more depending on the value of @xmath68 ( see fig .",
    "[ nmax2d ] ) .",
    "finally , one should be careful in interpreting the @xmath60 vs. thickness curves since most observations are not made in real time ( as in the computer simulations ) and there can be post - deposition evolutions ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite for such complications in the case of atomic deposition ) .",
    "i review in this section the experimental results obtained these last years for low - energy cluster deposition , mainly in the submonolayer regime .",
    "the scope is double : first , i want to give some examples on how to analyze experiments ( as indicated in section [ sec_interpret ] ) and second , i will show that from a comparison of experiments and models one can deduce important physical quantities characterizing the interaction of a cluster with a surface ( cluster diffusivity ) and with another cluster ( coalescence ) .",
    "the following can be read with profit by those interested only in atomic deposition as examples of interpretation since these elementary processes are relevant for some cases of atomic deposition .",
    "one should be careful that some mechanisms which are specific to atomic deposition ( transient mobility , funnelling ,  ) are not discussed here ( see @xcite ) .",
    "also , growth without cluster diffusion has to be interpreted in the framework of the percolation model as indicated above @xcite .    before analyzing experimental data , it is important to know how to make the connection between the units used in the programs and the experimental ones ( see also table i ) . in the program ,",
    "the unit length is the diameter of a cluster . in the experiments , it is therefore convenient to use as a surface unit the _ site _ , which is the projected surface of a cluster @xmath71 where @xmath25 is the mean _ incident _ cluster diameter .",
    "the flux is then expressed as the number of clusters reaching the surface per second per site ( which is the same as ml / s ) and the island density is given per site .",

    "the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient is so high that we wondered whether there was any problem in the interpretation of the data , in despite of the very good agreement between experiments and growth models described above .",
    "for example , one could think of a linear diffusion of the incoming clusters , induced by the incident kinetic energy of the cluster in the beam ( the cluster could `` slide '' on the graphite surface ) .",
    "this seems unrealistic for two reasons : first , in order to explain the low island density obtained in the experiments ( see above ) , it should be assumed that the cluster , which has a low kinetic energy ( less than 10 ev ) , can travel at least several thousand nanometers before being stopped by friction with the substrate .",
    "this would imply that the diffusion is just barely influenced by the substrate , which only slows down the cluster . in this case",
    ", it is difficult to explain the large changes observed in the island density when the substrate temperature varies .",
    "second , we have deposited antimony clusters on a graphite substrate tilted to @xmath81 from its usual position ( i.e. perpendicular to the beam axis ) .",
    "then , a linear diffusion of the antimony clusters arising from their incident kinetic energy would lead to anisotropic islands ( they would grow differently in the direction of tilt and its perpendicular ) .",

    "they also show that , at least in this case , forming the clusters on the surface by atomic aggregation or depositing preformed clusters does not change the orientation nor the diffusion of the clusters on the surface .",
    "work is in progress to determine the precise atomic structure of the clusters , their orientation on the substrate and their diffusion at higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "in the preceding sections i have tried to analyze the growth with the help of two main ingredients : diffusion of the clusters on the surface and their interaction .",

    "these mechanisms have been extensively studied @xcite and are relatively well - know . in the ( simplest ) case of compact ( 111 ) flat surfaces , diffusion occurs by site to site jumps over bridge sites ( the transition state ) .",

    "more than twenty years ago , the marseille group @xcite carefully studied the mobility of nanometer - size gold crystallites on ionic substrates ( mgo , kcl , nacl ) . by three different methods",

    "it is instructive to follow the trajectory followed by the cluster center of mass ( fig .",

    "[ trajectory]a ) , this trajectory is `` brownian - like '' , with no apparent influence of the substrate .",
    "this is consistent with the simple `` surface of contact '' argument . instead , when the mismatch is small ( fig .",
    "[ trajectory]b ) , the center of mass of the cluster follows a `` hopping - like '' trajectory , jumping from site to site on the honeycomb lattice defined by the substrate .",
    "when @xmath155 , there seems to be a transition between the two regimes around @xmath156 .",
    "it is interesting to consider the interpretation of cluster motion in terms of dislocation displacement within the cluster , a mechanism which has been proposed to explain rapid 2d cluster diffusion @xcite ( see the discussion in section [ sec_diff2d ] ) . for this",
    ", one can `` freeze '' the internal degrees of freedom of the cluster deposited on a thermalized substrate .",
    "the center of mass trajectory is integrated using the quaternion algorithm .",
    "surprisingly , the diffusion constant follows the same power law as in the free cluster case @xcite .",
    "this result proves that the diffusion mechanism in this case can not be simply explained in terms of dislocation migration within the cluster as proposed to explain the diffusion of 2d islands in @xcite . as the substrate atoms are tethered to their lattice site , strong elastic deformations or dislocations within the lattice",
    "are also excluded .",
    "hence , the motor for diffusion is here the vibrational motion of the substrate , and its efficiency appears to be comparable to that of the internal cluster modes .",
    "very recently , u. landmann performed md simulations of diffusion of large gold clusters on hopg substrates @xcite .",
    "he finds high cluster mobility , in agreement with the preceding simulations .",
    "his studies show that cluster diffusion in this case proceeds by two different mechanisms : long ( several cluster diameters ) linear `` flights '' separated by relatively slow diffusive motion as observed in the preceding simulations .",
    "further work is needed to ascertain the atomic mechanisms leading to this kind of motion .",
    "what are the ( partial ) conclusions which can be drawn from these studies of cluster diffusion ?",
    "i think that the main parameter determining the mobility of 3d islands on a substrate is the possible epitaxy of the cluster on the substrate .",
    "indeed , if the island reaches an epitaxial orientation , it is likely to have a mobility limited by the individual atomic movements , which give a small diffusion constant ( of order @xmath157 at room temperature ) .",
    "diffusivities of this magnitude will not affect the growth of cluster films during typical deposition times , and clusters can be considered immobile .",
    "the effect of these kind of diffusion rates can only be seen by annealing the substrates at higher temperatures or for long times . according to hamilton @xcite",
    ", dislocations could propagate even for epitaxial islands , but it is likely that this mechanism is more important in the case of heteroepitaxial islands which i now proceed to discuss .",
    "indeed , if the island is not in epitaxy on the substrate , high mobilities can be observed because the cluster sees a potential profile which is not very different from that seen by a single atom .",
    "it should be noted that this non - epitaxy can be obtained when the two lattice parameters ( of the substrate and the island ) are very different , or also when they are compatible if there is relative misorientation .",
    "the latter has been observed for gold on ionic substrates @xcite and mobility is relatively high until the crystallites reach epitaxy .",
    "the md simulations presented above show that , for lennard - jones potentials , only homoepitaxy prevents clusters from moving rapidly on a surface .",
    "it should be noted that relaxation of the cluster or the substrate - which would favor a locking of the cluster in an energetically favorable position at the expense of some elastic energy - has not been observed in these lj simulations , nor has dislocation propagation .",
    "this is probably realistic for the low interaction energies which correspond to metal clusters on graphite .",
    "it could also be argued that dislocation motion is more difficult in 3d clusters than in 2d islands since the upper part of the particle ( absent in 2d islands ) tends to keep a fixed structure .",
    "another important parameter is the cluster - substrate interaction : one can think that a large attractive interaction ( for metal on metal systems for example ) can induce an epitaxial orientation and prevent the cluster from diffusing , even in the heteroepitaxial case .",
    "the differences between the diffusion of clusters grown on a substrate by atom deposition and aggregation and those previously formed in a beam and deposited must also be investigated .",
    "one could anticipate that islands formed by atom aggregation _ on _ the substrate would accommodate easily to the substrate geometry , whereas preformed clusters might keep their ( metastable ) configuration . however , it is not at all clear that island nucleation and epitaxy are simultaneous phenomena , for it has been observed that islands can form in a somewhat arbitrary configuration and subsequently orient on the substrate after diffusion and rotation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .      what happens now when two clusters meet ?",
    "if they remain simply juxtaposed , morphologies similar to fig .",
    "[ sb]a are observed . in this case , the incident clusters have retained their original morphology , and the supported particles are identical to them , even if they are in contact with many others after cluster diffusion .",

    "[ au ] that this is not always the case . in these cases ,",
    "the supported islands are clearly larger than the incident clusters : some _ coalescence _ has taken place .",
    "how can one understand and predict the size of the supported particles ? which are the relevant microscopic parameters ?",

    "i will first briefly examine the classical theory for sphere - sphere coalescence ( i.e. ignoring the effect of the substrate ) and then review recent molecular dynamics simulations which suggest that this classical theory may not be entirely satisfactory for nanoparticles .",

    "the `` motor '' of the coalescence is the diffusion of _ atoms _ of the cluster ( or island ) surface from the regions of high curvature ( where they have less neighbors and therefore are less bound ) towards the regions of lower curvature .",

    "first , the calculation leading to it from the expression of the flux ( eq .  [ atflux ] ) is only approximate .",
    "more importantly , eq .  [ atflux ] assumes _ isotropic _ surface tension and diffusion coefficients . while this approximation may be fruitful for large particles ( in the @xmath4 m range , @xcite ) , it is clearly wrong for clusters in the nanometer range .",
    "these are generally facetted @xcite as a result of anisotropic surface energies .",
    "this has two important consequences : first , since the particles are not spherical , the atoms do not feel a uniform curvature . for those located on the planar facets ,",
    "the curvature is even 0 , meaning that they will not tend to move away spontaneously .",
    "this effect should significantly reduce the atomic flux .",
    "second , the diffusion is hampered by the edges between the facets @xcite which induce a kind of `` schwoebel '' effect @xcite .",
    "then , the effective mass transfer from one end of the cluster to the other may be significantly lower than expected from the isotropic curvatures used in eq .",
    "[ atflux ] . for these anisotropic surfaces , a more general formula which takes into account the dependence of @xmath160 on the crystallographic orientation should be used ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , this formula is of limited practical interest for two reasons .",
    "first , the precise dependence of the surface energy on the crystallographic orientation is difficult to obtain .",
    "second , as a system of two touching facetted clusters does not in general show any symmetry , the solution to the differential equation is hard to find .",
    "one possibility currently explored @xcite is to assume a simple analytical equation for the anisotropy of 2d islands and integrate numerically the full ( anisotropic ) mullins equations .",
    "since continuum theories face difficulties in characterizing the evolution of nanoparticle coalescence , it might be useful to perform molecular dynamics ( md ) studies of this problem .",
    "several studies @xcite have been performed , showing that two distinct and generally subsequent processes lead to coalescence for particles in the nanometer range : plastic deformation @xcite and slow surface diffusion @xcite .",
    "zhu and averback @xcite have studied the first stages ( up to 160 ps ) of the coalescence of two single - crystal copper nanoparticles ( diameter 4.8 nm ) .",
    "[ cucoale ] presents four stages of the coalescence process , demonstrating that plastic deformation takes place ( see the arrows indicating the sliding planes ) and that a relative rotation of the particles occurs during this plastic deformation ( c and d ) . during the first 5 ps ,",
    "the deformation is elastic , until the elastic limit ( roughly 0.8 nm @xcite ) is reached : after this , since the shear stress ( fig .",
    "[ stress ] ) is very high , dislocations are formed and glide on ( 111 ) planes in the @xmath174 direction , as usually seen in fcc systems .",
    "[ stress ] also shows that after 40ps ( i.e. fig .",
    "[ cucoale]c ) the stress on the glide plane is much smaller and dislocation motion is less important : the two particles rotate until a low - energy grain boundary is found ( fig .",
    "[ cucoale]d ) .",
    "this intial stage of the coalescence , where the two particles reorient and find a low - energy configuration , is very rapid , but does not lead in general to thorough coalescence .",
    "an interesting exception might have been found by yu and duxbury @xcite : their md simulations showed that for very small clusters ( typically less than 200 atoms ) coalescence is abrupt provided the temperature is sufficiently close to the melting temperature .",
    "they argue that this is due to a ( not specified ) `` nucleation process '' : plastic deformation is a tempting possibility .    for larger clusters ,",
    "the subsequent stages are much slower and imply a different mechanism : atom _ diffusion _ on the surface of the particles .",
    "the intial stages of this diffusion - mediated coalescence have been studied by lewis et al . @xcite .",

    "evidently , an important role of the substrate in the actual coalescence of supported clusters is to ensure thermalization , which is taken care of here by coupling the system to a fictitious `` thermostat '' @xcite .",
    "one therefore expects these coalescence events to be relevant to the study of supported clusters in the case where they are loosely bound to the substrate , e.g. , gold clusters on a graphite substrate .",

    ", one can look at a large circular island to which clusters are arriving by diffusion on the substrate ( fig .",

    "there are two antagonist effects at play here .",

    "therefore one expects the clusters touching an island to coalesce with it , leading to compact ( spherical ) domains .",
    "the other process , driving the system away from this minimization is the continuous arrival of clusters on the island edge .",
    "this kinetic effect tends to form ramified islands .",
    "what is the result of this competition ?",

    "[ xcoalet ] even if it is only approximate , to derive an upper limit for the size of the compact domains grown by cluster deposition .",

    "[ xcoalet ] , hence diminishing the actual size of these domains .",
    "we first need an estimate of the kinetics of the second process : the impinging of clusters on the big island .",
    "a very simple argument is used here ( see also @xcite for a similar analysis for atomic growth ) : since the number of clusters reaching the surface is @xmath9 per unit surface per second and the total number of islands is @xmath60 per unit surface , each island receives in average a cluster every @xmath189 .",
    "we are now in a position to quantify the degree of coalescence in a given growth experiment .",
    "let me suppose that a cluster touches a large island at t=0 . if no cluster impinges on the island before this cluster completely coalesces ( in a time @xmath186 according to eq .",

    "if a cluster touches the previous cluster before its total coalescence has taken place , it will almost freeze up the coalescence of the previous cluster .",

    "one can anticipate that the physical mechanism for cluster size evolution is , as in the submonolayer case , sintering by atomic diffusion .",
    "for thick films however , surface diffusion can only be effective before a given cluster has been `` buried '' by the subsequent deposited clusters .",
    "thus , most of the size evolution takes place during growth , for after the physical routes to coalescence ( bulk or grain boundary diffusion ) are expected to be much slower .",
    "studies of compacted nanopowders @xcite have shown that nanoparticles are very stable against grain growth .",
    "siegel @xcite explains this phenomenon in the following way .",
    "the two factors affecting the chemical potential of the atoms , and potentially leading to structure evolutions are local differences in cluster size or in curvature .",
    "however , for the relatively uniform grain size distributions and flat grain boundaries observed for cluster assembled materials @xcite , these two factors are not active , and there is nothing telling locally to the atoms in which direction to migrate to reduce the global energy .",
    "therefore , the whole structure is likely to be in a deep local ( metastable ) minimum in energy , as observed in closed - cell foams .",
    "the stability of such structures has been confirmed by several computer simulations @xcite which have indicated a possible mechanism of grain growth at very high ( @xmath221 ) temperatures : grain boundary amorphization or melting @xcite .    what determines the size of the supported particles _ during _ the growth ?",
    "for thick films , a reasonable assumption is that a cluster impinging on a surface already covered by layer of clusters does _ not _ diffuse , because it forms strong bonds with the layer of the deposited clusters .",
    "this hypothesis has been checked for the growth of @xmath72 on graphite @xcite .",
    "there are two main differences with submonolayer growth : first , an impinging cluster has more than one neighbor and the sphere - sphere kinetics is not very realistic ; second the relevant time for ramification i have used in the preceding section is no more useful here since clusters do not move . as a first approximation , to obtain an upper limit in the size of the domains , we can use the same coalescence kinetics and take a different `` ramification '' time : the average time for the arrival of a cluster touching another is roughly @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the diameter of the cluster . if the same formula ( eq .

    "these predictions agree with the computer simulations presented in this paper and are relevant for both cluster and atomic deposition ( see ref .",

    "the rate equation describing the time evolution of the density @xmath32 of monomers on the surface is , to lowest relevant orders in f : @xmath233 the first term on the right hand size denotes the flux of monomers onto the island free surface , ( @xmath61 is the island coverage discussed below ) .",
    "the second term represents the effect of evaporation , i.e. monomers evaporate after an average time @xmath26 .",
    "the third term is due to the possibility of losing monomers by effect of direct impingement of a deposited monomers right beside a monomer still on the surface to form an island .",
    "this `` direct impingement '' term is usually negligible , and indeed will turn out to be very small in this particular equation , but the effect of direct impingement plays a crucial role in the kinetics of the system in the high evaporation regimes .",
    "the last two terms represent the loss of monomers by aggregation with other monomers and with islands respectively .",
    "the factors @xmath234 and @xmath235 are the `` cross sections '' for encounters and are calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the number @xmath60 of islands will be given by : @xmath236 where the first term represents the formation of islands due to direct impingement of deposited monomers next to monomers already on the surface , and the second term accounts for the formation of islands by the encounter of monomers diffusing on the surface .",
    "the term in brackets represents the increase of coverage due to formation of islands of size 2 ( i.e. formed by two monomers ) either by direct impingement or by monomer - monomer aggregation .",
    "the next term gives the increase of coverage due to the growth of the islands as a result of monomers aggregating onto them by diffusion , and the last term represents the growth of the islands due to direct impingement of deposited monomers onto their boundary , or directly on the island .",
    "this last term depends on @xmath238 , the desorption length of monomers diffusing on top of the islands @xcite . in all the simulations presented here ( section [ sec_models ] ) ,",
    "i have taken @xmath239 .",
    "the total surface coverage is given by @xmath240 except at very short times .",
    "the cross section for monomer - monomer encounters @xmath234 is obtained from the same formula substituting @xmath52 by the monomer radius , and @xmath22 by @xmath242 as corresponds to relative diffusion .",
    "after some additional approximations , one finds @xcite three principal regimes which are spanned as the evaporation time @xmath26 decreases .",
    "they have been called : _ complete condensation _",
    "regime where evaporation is not important , _ diffusion _ regime where islands grow mainly by diffusive capture of monomers and finally _ direct impingement _ regime where evaporation is so important that islands can grow only by capturing monomers directly from the vapor . within each of these regimes",
    ", there are several subregimes characterized by the value of @xmath238 .",
    "i use @xmath243 , the island - island distance at saturation when there is no evaporation and @xmath244 as the maximum island radius , reached at the onset of coalescence .",
    "i present here the summary of the different limits of growth of 3d islands in presence of evaporation and/or defects .",
