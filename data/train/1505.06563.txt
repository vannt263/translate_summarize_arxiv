    "above the planck energy scale @xmath0 , we expect a quantum theory of gravity in place of einstein s general relativity .",
    "the quantization of space - time will lead to the modification of the dispersion relation between energy and momentum of a particle with mass @xmath1 and the breakdown of lorentz invariance . in some quantum gravity models ,",
    "the consequence of the lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) is the energy dependence of the speed of light in vacuum @xcite . in these scenarios ,",
    "the energy dependent velocity of light is @xmath2 with effective quantum gravity energy scale @xmath3 , the speed of high energy photons is slower , and low energy photons will reach us earlier .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the light speed in vacuum can be used to study the liv effect .    in the past years , both astrophysics and particle physics experiments have been proposed to test the liv and quantum gravity effects @xcite .",
    "because photons with different energy will reach us at different time , and the energy of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) which are the most luminous explosions in the universe with short duration ranges from kev to gev , grbs with intense bursts of @xmath4-ray photons from cosmological distances are proposed to measure the difference of the arrival time of photons with different energy @xcite .",
    "grbs were also used to constrain liv theories @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the data for a tev @xmath4-ray flare coming from the active galaxy markarian 421 to set a bound on the energy scale of quantum gravity as @xmath5 gev .",
    "@xcite used grb 090510 to study the liv effect and get @xmath6 , the energy scale of quantum gravity was found to be @xmath7 gev by using grb 080916c .",
    "the liv effects due to extra dimensions can also be constrained by grbs @xcite .",
    "experiments with cold atoms were also proposed to constrain the modified dispersion relation due to quantum gravity @xcite .    in order to measure the liv , statistical and possible systematic uncertainties must be minimized . for this purpose , @xcite developed a method to analyze samples of grbs with different redshifts and energy bands .",
    "the technique has the advantage of extracting time - dependent features from the signals of many grbs . in the analysis @xcite",
    ", they used both the batse and osse data from the compton gamma ray observatory . by adding larger samples of grbs with known redshifts from hete and swift , the observed time delay was formulated in terms of linear regression where the intercept denotes intrinsic time delay and the linear term denotes liv effect @xcite . by using the concordance @xmath8cdm model with @xmath9 , they found no strong evidence of liv , and they obtained @xmath10 gev @xcite .    since the distances from the sources to the observer depend on cosmological models , the conclusions on the liv and quantum gravity effect may be affected by the cosmological model used in the analysis . however , only the concordance @xmath8cdm scenario ( @xmath9 , @xmath11 ) was studied @xcite . therefore , it is necessary to consider other cosmological models .",
    "recently @xcite studied the liv by using the quintessence and chaplygin gas model and they found a weak evidence of liv . in their analysis ,",
    "the degeneracies among model parameters were neglected , as they were taken as fixed values . in this paper",
    "we mainly discuss the possible liv by using different cosmological models which explain the present cosmic acceleration . compared with the previous work , in addition to the relevant parameters quantifying liv , the cosmological parameters are also treated as free parameters .",
    "we adopt the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique to constrain liv and model parameters with the observational data . in order to derive tighter constraints on the model parameters ,",
    "we combine the time delay data from grbs with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data from the planck first year release @xcite , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data @xcite , and the 557 union2 sneia data @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we introduce the liv in section ii . the grbs time delay and other observational data",
    "are discussed in section iii .",
    "the constraint results on liv and cosmological parameters with different cosmological models are presented in section iv , and finally , the conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "the modified dispersion relation due to quantum gravity models can be parameterized as follows @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a dimensionless parameter , @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 , and the effective energy scale @xmath3 of quantum gravity is expected to be near the planck scale . because the liv effects are small , @xcite , we consider the @xmath17 term only in this study .    since the arrival time for photons with energy @xmath18 is equal to @xcite @xmath19 \\frac{dz'}{h(z ' ) } , \\label{flight time}\\ ] ] so the the arrival times of two photons with different energy will be different , and the difference in time for the energy difference @xmath20 is @xmath21 where the dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the hubble constant and @xmath24 is the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath25 . in order to account for the unknown intrinsic time lags , we fit the measured time - lags by including a parameter @xmath26 specified in the rest frame of the source .",
    "the arrival time delays are fitted by the formula @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the simple linear fitting function is @xmath28 where the intercept represents the intrinsic time lags , the liv effects are encoded in the slope @xmath29 which is related to the scale of lorentz violation @xcite and @xmath30 is related to the measurements of cosmic distances .",
    "the model dependence is through the function @xmath31 which will be calculated for three popular cosmological models .",
    "in this paper we use the batse data with 9 light curves whose time resolution is 64 ms and redshifts span from from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , the hete data with 15 light curves whose time resolution is 164 ms and redshifts span from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , and the swift data with 11 light curves whose time resolution is 64 ms and redshifts span from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , the data was shown in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "so we use the data of time lags between different energy channels measured from the light curves of 35 grbs with redshifts from @xmath34 to @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the spectral time lags are obtained from the light curves in the 115 - 320 kev energy band with respect to those in the lowest 25 - 55 kev energy band . to test the liv effect",

    "the model parameters are fixed and the degeneracies among parameters are neglected . to account for the degeneracies among these parameters , it would be better to treat the model parameters as free parameters and estimate their nominal values from the observational data . with this aim ,",
