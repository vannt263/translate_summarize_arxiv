    "the quest for a standard model ( sm ) extension capable of addressing its several observational caveats has fuelled intensive experimental searches , encompassing high - energy colliders , high - intensity facilities , as well as numerous astroparticle and cosmological searches .",
    "so far , no direct evidence for the new states has been unveiled in collider searches , and this has in turn intensified the interest for the so - called indirect searches , in which very rare processes , strongly suppressed or even forbidden in the sm , are looked for . among the many observables that are being studied and explored , those signaling the violation of lepton flavour are powerful probes of new physics ( np ) , sensitive to new scales often lying well beyond collider reach .",
    "numerous processes are currently being searched for in high - intensity facilities , and these include charged lepton flavour violating ( clfv ) radiative decays , three - body decays and nuclear - assisted transitions ; likewise , a vast array of rare transitions and decays is being looked for at high - energy colliders .",
    "the current bounds are already impressive , and many running and/or upcoming experiments ( as is the case of meg ii , mu3e , mu2e , comet and lhcb ) should improve them in the near future . in table",
    "[ table : clfv : bounds ] we summarise the present experimental bounds and future sensitivities for several radiative and 3-body clfv decays ( which will be relevant for our subsequent discussion ) .",

[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     should one dispose of an unlimited number of leptons in the beam , the in - flight clfv conversion could simultaneously probe - or even be complementary to other low - and high - energy clfv observables .",
    "nevertheless , the small expected number of converted leptons , for what are already optimistic beam configurations , dismisses the latter possibilities .",
    "other theoretical frameworks relying on extensions of the sm via several sterile fermions are expected to lead to similar ( or even worse ) prospects : studies of observables in which dipole and @xmath28 penguin contributions play important rles  @xcite allowed to verify that complete models as the ( 3,3 ) iss realisation or the @xmath29msm , systematically lead to smaller predictions to the distinct observables ( among them 3-body decays , conversion in nuclei , or clfv @xmath28 decays ) than what is found in the framework of the simple `` 3 + 1 model '' .",
    "we have explicitly ( numerically ) confirmed that this is indeed the case .",
    "in the past years , charged lepton flavour violating observables have gained an increasing interest stemming from their potential to probe scenarios of new physics , even those whose typical scales lie beyond collider reach . in view of upcoming facilities , which are expected to operate with intense lepton beams ( for example those dedicated to high - intensity clfv searches as comet , future neutrino factories , or even a muon collider ) ,",
    "in - flight lepton flavour conversions occuring when the intense beams hit a fixed target , are potentially interesting clfv observables .    in this study",
    "we have thus revisited clfv in - flight conversion , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , focusing on elastic interactions with a nucleus @xmath3 ( considering moderately energetic beams , with an energy not far from the kinematical threshold ) .",
    "we have studied the different contributions to the differential cross sections , and our findings concerning the derivation of the leptonic and hadronic tensors are in agreement with those of ref .",
    ". motivated by classes of np models in which clfv processes occur at higher order , we have moreover focused on the dipole and @xmath28-penguin contributions to the in - flight clfv conversion .    after a general discussion of the observable",
    ", we carried a thorough phenomenological analysis in the framework of minimal sm extensions via sterile neutrinos , in which @xmath28-penguin transitions do indeed dominate over the dipole contributions ( and box diagrams as well ) .",
    "although such minimal frameworks do offer the possibility to have sizeable values for the cross sections , @xmath30 , these values are precluded due to the stringent bounds arising from a number of other clfv observables . particularly constraining",
    "are those observables in which the @xmath28-penguin contributions also play a relevant rle - among them br(@xmath31 ) , br(@xmath32 ) , br(@xmath33 ) , and cr(@xmath5 , au ) .",
    "once the latter bounds are taken into account , the distinct cross sections are strongly reduced - at most one expects values of @xmath34 , for the case of @xmath35 conversion ( for which the associated low - energy clfv constraints are less stringent ) .",
    "even when assuming the possibility of very intense lepton beams , our study suggests that the expected number of conversions lies beyond experimental sensitivity ( below @xmath36 ) .",
    "albeit the results here obtained concern minimal sm extensions via sterile neutrinos , the strong correlation between the in - flight conversion and the clfv observables which preclude its observability should be common to other np constructions exhibiting similar features .",
    "this is the case of minimal ( constrained ) susy models , where there is typically a strong correlation between radiative decays and the @xmath37-penguins providing the dominant contributions to 3-body decays ; in this sense , our findings confirm those of  @xcite which pointed out that former bounds on @xmath38 already forbade susy contributions to @xmath39 larger than @xmath40  fb .",
    "it is also worth considering the possibility of having additional sterile states : if on the one hand this might contribute to enhance the @xmath41 cross sections ( via a multiplicative factor , thus leading at most to a single order of magnitude enhancement ) , the additional states would also contribute to the other clfv observables , so that one does not expect an overall improvement .",
    "likewise , a study in the dis limit should not qualitatively change the general results here derived .",
    "should experimental searches for the in - flight clfv conversion observable be carried in the future , and should an event be observed , then another source of flavour violation , different from - or in addition to - those present in minimal sm extensions via sterile fermions must be necessarily present . moreover ,",
    "available ( phenomenological ) results would suggest that such a np model would likely exhibit a smaller degree of correlation between different clfv observables ( as is the case of leptoquark models ) : for example , some transitions occurring at tree - level , while others being mediated via higher order exchanges .    finally , and as in the case of any clfv observable , the experimental observation of the in - flight clfv conversion would clearly signal the presence of new physics , and allow selecting classes of models ( other than those here discussed ) which could account for it .",
