    "when did the bulk of stars in galaxies form ? a huge number of studies have sought to answer this question ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "observational evidence indicates that the star formation activity and agn activity peaked at @xmath131 , very likely between 2 @xmath14 3 .",
    "sub - millimeter ( submm ) surveys have shown that a large fraction of the total energy output of galaxies in this critical epoch of galaxy formation comes from luminous , dusty galaxies @xcite .",
    "the most luminous submm sources are widely believed to be the progenitors of today s massive ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the slope of the submm source counts rises steeply , indicating strong evolution , and the background radiation intensity at submm wavelengths is believed to be dominated by sources with fluxes @xmath91 mjy @xcite . to understand galaxy evolution",
    ", it is therefore imperative to study the typically faint but numerous sub - mjy submm galaxies ( smgs ) . unfortunately , even with the best submm continuum data , these intrinsically faint sources are difficult , if not impossible to study at present .",
    "the deepest existing 850@xmath15 m continuum surveys are all limited by confusion at 2 mjy @xcite .",
    "over 400 smgs have been identified so far , yet their distribution and evolution as a function of redshift has been hampered by difficulties in identifying optical counterparts and obtaining reliable redshifts until relatively recently @xcite . at the faint end of the luminosity function ( with intrinsic fluxes @xmath16 10 mjy ) , only five redshifts for submillimeter galaxies",
    "have been confirmed absolutely by the detection of co spectral lines @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the detection of co ( @xmath0=3@xmath12 ) emission using the owens valley radio observatory s millimeter array ( ovro mma ) from the _ faintest _ submm galaxy to date , the remarkable object smm j16359 + 6612 @xcite that lies in a rare high - magnification configuration behind the intervening massive cluster gravitational lens abell 2218 .",
    "its intrinsic 850@xmath15 m continuum flux after correcting for the well - constrained gravitational lensing effect of the foreground cluster is only @xmath90.8 mjy .",
    "we used ovro mma to search for co ( @xmath0=3@xmath12 ) line emission from smm j16359 + 6612 at the redshift ( @xmath3=2.5165 ) derived from h@xmath4   using keck - nirspec @xcite between october 2003 and april 2004 in three array configurations , l , e and h. the total integration time on source was 52.9 hours with a typical single - sideband temperature of 250k .",
    "the digital spectrometer was configured to observe at 98.3297 ghz with a spectral bandwidth of 448 mhz and a spectral resolution of 4 mhz .",
    "the phase and pointing center was @xmath4(j2000 ) = 16:35:52.50 and @xmath17(j2000 ) = + 66:12:15.00 .",
    "we used the nearby quasar j1638 + 573 to correct for atmospheric phase and gain variations .",
    "the spectral bandpass was determined from observations of the quasars 3c84 , 3c345 and/or 3c273 .",
    "uranus and/or 3c273 were used for absolute flux calibration , leading to a 15% uncertainty in the overall flux scale .",
    "data from each track was calibrated separately using the mma software package @xcite , and the @xmath18-data were imaged using standard routines in the miriad package @xcite .",
    "the resulting channel maps were binned to a spectral resolution of 16 mhz ( 48.8 km  s@xmath5 ) , and have a synthesized beam of 4@xmath1953 @xmath10 4@xmath1906 at a position angle of @xmath2059@xmath21 with a noise level of 1.7 mjy beam@xmath5 .",
    "the channel maps were then corrected for primary beam attenuation and combined into a velocity - integrated map ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the co spectra corresponding to each image , along with a typical representation of the noise .",
    "the co ( @xmath0=3@xmath12 ) emission is brightest from the central image .",
    "co - adding the spectra from the peak emission in each image and fitting a single gaussian yields a redshift of z=2.5168@xmath220.0003 , consistent with the h@xmath4  redshift ( z@xmath23=2.5165@xmath220.0015 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the co kinematics are intriguing .",
    "co emission is present at @xmath24 2@xmath25 over 400 km  s@xmath5  in two velocity components located approximately @xmath20160 and + 120 km  s@xmath5  with velocity widths of @xmath26 km  s@xmath5  each .",

    "a consistent profile can be seen in image c to the south .",
    "the northern image a shows only the red component of the co emission but image a is at the edge of our primary beam and suffers from a lower signal to noise ratio .",

    "we adopt @xmath4 = 4 m@xmath8  ( k km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath28)@xmath5 , similar to the galactic value ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , wmap cosmology ( h@xmath29=71 km  s@xmath5mpc@xmath5 , @xmath30=0.27 , @xmath31=0.73 ) , and lensing amplification numbers from @xcite . our choice of @xmath4 = 4 m@xmath8  ( k km  s@xmath5  pc@xmath28)@xmath5 is consistent with that estimated for arp 220 @xcite after correcting for brightness ratio of t@xmath32[co ( @xmath0=3@xmath12)]/t@xmath32[co ( @xmath0=1@xmath10 ) ] @xmath33 0.6 typically observed in starbursts @xcite .",
    "we follow the formulae in @xcite using a luminosity distance calculated using wmap cosmology .",
    "we correct for the effect of gravitational lensing by dividing the observed co fluxes of each image by its lensing amplification , and then compare the results inferred from all three images . since a is at the edge of the primary beam and suffers from lower signal to noise , we also give the masses derived for each image separately ( table [ fluxtab ] ) .",

    "note that @xmath4 is uncertain and depends on metallicity and excitation ; it may be as low as @xmath4 = 1 m@xmath8  ( k km  s@xmath5pc@xmath28)@xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which case the total h@xmath12 mass is @xmath9 @xmath34m@xmath8 , comparable to the molecular gas mass in the milky way .    we estimate a dust mass of @xmath35 from the 850@xmath15",
    "m flux density , assuming a dust temperature of @xmath36k .",
    "the inferred gas - to - dust ratio of 100 is consistent with metal - rich galaxies in the local universe , suggesting that the central regions of smmj16359 + 6612 have already been significantly enriched with metals .",
    "the co emission from image b may be partially resolved in one dimension . using the _ imfit _ task in miriad we fit the velocity - integrated emission and measure a deconvolved size of 3@xmath190 @xmath10 1@xmath194 at a position angle of @xmath2068@xmath37 . according to the @xcite model ,",
    "the linear stretch due to lensing amplification along this position angle is about a factor of 2 .",
    "the major axis of the co emission thus has an intrinsic extent of about 12kpc , while the emission in the direction of the minor axis is unresolved .",
    "note that the size estimates are upper limits given the low signal to noise of the map ; it is possible that the co emission is originating from a significantly smaller area .",
    "smm j16359 + 6612 has several remarkable properties .",
    "the galaxy morphology indicates an extremely red central core ( @xmath38 in @xcite ) bracketed by blue features ( @xmath39 ) . unlike many submm galaxies , which show",
    "ly@xmath4 is present in emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , smm j16359 + 6612 has ly@xmath4 in absorption , as in most lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) @xcite .",
    "given the complex morphology , the ly@xmath4 absorption , the bright submm and infrared fluxes and compact h@xmath4  emission , the star - formation activity in smmj16359 + 6612 is likely to be highly dust enshrouded .",
    "the size of the red core in _ hst _ images suggests that the star formation has an extent of only a few kpc @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath4  linewidth in this galaxy is only @xmath9280 km  s@xmath5 , which is greater than for most lbgs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but less than typically found for high - redshift qsos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the star formation rate estimated from the far - infrared luminosity may be as high as 500m@xmath8yr@xmath5   @xcite , an order of magnitude larger than in most lbgs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "is smm j16359 + 6612 at a later evolutionary stage than submm sources previously studied in co ?",
    "is it massive ? what will be the fate of this galaxy and how long can it maintain its starburst / possible agn activity ?",
    "the molecular gas observations offer answers to some of these questions .",
    "the molecular mass inferred from the co data provides a modest reservoir of @xmath92@xmath1010@xmath11 m@xmath8  for this rate of star formation activity .",
    "the extent of the co emission indicates that the molecular gas is likely located in the central few kpc , similar to the size of the red core in optical images @xcite .",
    "if all the gas is consumed at the estimated current star formation rate of 100500 m@xmath8  yr@xmath5 , then the activity should cease in a mere 40200 myr .",
    "the nature of the star formation is reminiscent of circumnuclear starbursts in local infrared ultraluminous galaxies where the timescale for bursts is typically on the order of @xmath9100 myr , although the star formation rates and central molecular concentration in the lower redshift galaxies are both less by about a factor of 10 . the gas and star formation activity in local starbursts",
    "are often distributed in a ring - like or disk - like morphology ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this respect",
    "too smm j16359",
    "+ 6612 could resemble a circumnuclear starburst : the two co velocity components may indicate a gas ring or disk morphology .",
    "if the co were centrally concentrated ( and in the absence of merging ) we would expect a single broad velocity peak in the co emission .",
    "there is one troubling discrepancy between the co and h@xmath4  observations .",
    "the co linewidth is about 500 km  s@xmath5  whereas the h@xmath4  linewidth is 280 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "one explanation for this difference is that the two lines trace different parts of the galactic potential : the h@xmath4  emission is likely confined to only the central 12 kpc in the source plane @xcite whereas the co emission may come from a more extended region .",
    "this distribution could be consistent with a ring morphology for the co distribution if the central molecular gas has been consumed by the starburst activity .",
    "another possibility is that we are only observing the h@xmath4  emission from the near side of the galaxy or through windows where there is less extinction from dust .",
    "as the co emission is only barely resolved , higher spatial resolution observations ( e.g. , with iram , carma and eventually alma ) are needed to understand the relative distribution of the molecular gas and star formation activity .",
    "do all galaxies pass through a bright - submm phase ?",
    "this is an outstanding question in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "certainly the brightest submm sources at near - ir wavelengths are believed to be analogs of today s local , massive , early type galaxies @xcite .",
    "but what about the fainter submm sources that contribute the majority of the submm background ? do later hubble types and less massive galaxies also pass through a bright submm phase when building their bulges and perhaps when their stellar disks begin to form ?",
    "if so , then the corresponding fainter submm galaxies should not be very massive ( @xmath40m@xmath8 ) . with the co data for smm j16359 + 6612 , comparable to that available for cb58 @xcite",
    ", we can make an attempt to address this fundamental question .    assuming that the molecular gas is tracing the galaxy mass at a radius of 6 kpc , and using the co linewidth of 500 km  s@xmath5",
    ", we estimate a dynamical mass of 9@xmath1010@xmath11 m@xmath8 .",
    "note , however , that the mass is uncertain by at least a factor of two and depends on several important assumptions .",
    "the mass may be smaller depending on the true size of the co emitting region which is , at best , only barely resolved in these data .",
    "the mass could also be higher depending on the inclination of any disk present .    not surprisingly , the dynamical mass in smm j16359 + 6612 is at the low end of smgs ( see review by @xcite and references therein ) , and is higher than the typical dynamical masses ( @xmath910@xmath11m@xmath8 ) inferred for lbgs @xcite .",
    "but unlike previous smgs , and especially the strongly lensed lbg cb58 for which co spectroscopy is available @xcite , smm j16359 + 6612 lacks a large molecular gas reservoir by fraction .",
    "the relatively low gas fraction suggests that the bulk of the stellar mass in this system is already in place and so the stellar mass is unlikely to increase significantly without subsequent merging activity .",
    "so does this imply that a submm - bright phase is typical for all galaxies including the less massive galaxies in the field today ?",
    "smm j16359 + 6612 is part of a close galaxy group : two other galaxies ( # 384/#478 and # 273 ) , neither of which are detected in the submm , are within 130 kpc , and all three are separated by less than 100 km  s@xmath5  from each other in redshift .",
    "the submm luminosity of smm j16359 + 6612 may be boosted by star - formation triggered by the interaction with these neighbors @xcite .",
    "this situation is analogous to local galaxies where otherwise normal spirals undergo massive bursts of star formation and molecular gas inflow upon an interaction or merger ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we can not conclusively state that the faint end of the submm population is composed exclusively of low mass systems .",
    "however , as smm j16359 + 6612 appears to be less massive than the brightest submm sources , it is clear that a fraction of faint submm galaxies could be systems with low gas fractions and more modest total masses that could have elevated submm fluxes due to intense but short - lived starburst activity .",
    "our detection of molecular gas from smm j16359 + 6612 , the faintest submm - selected galaxy observed in co emission to date , reveals some remarkable properties .",
    "smm j16359 + 6612 is significantly smaller in extent , and has a lower dynamical mass _ and _ a lower gas mass fraction than previous smgs .",
    "these factors all suggest that smm j16359 + 6612 is unlikely to develop into a massive elliptical galaxy without extensive subsequent merging .",
    "the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas and star formation activity indicate that a circumnuclear starburst is likely to be responsible for the submm emission , in analogy with nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies .",
    "the luminous activity is likely induced by interactions with two neighboring galaxies .",
    "smm j16359 + 6612 indicates that at least a fraction of the sub - mjy submm sources are likely going through a bright submm phase due to an episode of intense star formation activity that is found in a galaxy of relatively modest mass , and triggered by environmental factors .",
    "this type of interaction - induced activity in a modestly massive system could help to explain the very strong clustering signal seen in submm galaxies @xcite .",
