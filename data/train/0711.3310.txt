    "m82 ( ngc 3034 ) is an irregular galaxy located at 3.3 mpc @xcite in the m81 group .",

    "most of its luminosity originates from the inner 500 pc hosting intense starburst activity presumably triggered by a tidal interaction with m81 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "evidence for this interaction comes from the hi streams which connect m81 to all three ( m82 , ngc 3077 , and ngc 2976 ) peculiar members of the inner m81 group @xcite .",
    "recent deep optical images also revealed stars associated with the hi bridge between m81 and m82 @xcite .    at the distance of m82",
    ", @xmath9 corresponds to 15 parsec , which allows spatially resolved studies of the starburst region .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mid - infrared [ neii]12.8@xmath2 m and millimetric co emission studies @xcite . according to @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "there is a rotating ring of ionized gas at a radius of @xmath11 pc , and on the inner side of a ring of molecular gas at @xmath12 pc .",
    "two possible spiral arms were also identified by @xcite and @xcite , at radii of @xmath13 pc and @xmath14 pc .",
    "the starburst of m82 drives a bipolar mass outflow out to several kiloparsecs perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy , especially evident in x - ray and h@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "dust has also been detected in the outflow region @xcite .",
    "the star forming regions of m82 are predominantly clustered in the volume enclosed by the molecular gas ring , indicated by the hii region tracers , like the [ neii]12.8@xmath2 m line and the mid- and far - infrared continuum emission @xcite .",
    "near - infrared hydrogen recombination lines also arise in these regions , but they are a more ambiguous tracer of star formation , as they can also be excited by shocks , though these are unlikely to dominate .    near - infrared integral field spectroscopy and iso - sws",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopy by @xcite allowed a detailed modelling of starburst activity in the central region @xcite .",
    "these models are consistent with the occurrence of starburst activity in two successive episodes , about 10 and 5 myr ago , each lasting a few million years . however , the spatial studies by @xcite and others covered only near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the large aperture of the iso - sws provided a continuous @xmath16 m spectrum but covered the whole central region of m82 .",
    "isocam - cvf data @xcite provided better spatial resolution but the spectra only had a spatial resolution of @xmath17 and were shortward of @xmath18 m .",
    "@xcite published spitzer - irs low - resolution spectra of a 1 arcmin wide strip along the minor axis of m82 , intersecting the disk at the eastern side .",
    "the spectra , taken as part of the sings legacy project , were combined with spitzer 8 and 24 @xmath2 m images , and show that the emission by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) and h@xmath3 molecules extends far out from the disk ( to 6 kpc ) in both directions .",
    "@xcite suggest that the filamentary aromatic - dominated emission represents dust either expelled from the galaxy as a result of a powerful nuclear superwind , or that dust is in the halo being lit up by the starburst , perhaps coexisting with the extensive warm h@xmath3 molecules .",
    "they suggest that this halo dust is probably a leftover from the interaction with m81 .",
    "in this paper we present mid - ir spectral maps at unsurpassed sensitivity and spatial resolution of the central @xmath19 kpc@xmath20 of m82 , covering the main contributors to the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "our goal is to provide a spatial and spectrally detailed description of the physical conditions within the central @xmath21 pc of m82 , to help us to give an insight on the evolution of the starburst activity in this region .",
    "this involves the study of the distribution of the radiation field , gas density , and the physical properties of pahs . of particular interest",

    "the spitzer / irs spectral maps allow a study of the spatial variation of the radiation field , based on the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio . due to the presence of several luminous star clusters in the central region",

    "the peak of x - ray emission is offset from the outflow axis by 30 pc .",
    "although the gradient in the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio does follow the outflow axis , it appears offset by 5 arcsec to the east , and associated with the eastern cluster .",
    "the overall morphology of the ionizing radiation in the region as revealed by the spectral maps seems to be in agreement with ground observations of the continuum and [ neii ] emission by @xcite .",
    "however , the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio varies only by a factor of three throughout the region and these variations do not correspond to the position of the emission peaks .",
    "an increase of the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio is observed further out of the galactic plane , but due to the limited spatial coverage of the map , we can not determine if this increase is connected to the outflows .",
    "the origins of the observed emission morphology and the variation of the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio are discussed in the following subsection .",
    "the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio measures the hardness of the radiation field , which is a function of stellar age and metallicity , and often parameterized by the effective temperature @xmath71 , and the radiation intensity as measured by the ionization parameter @xmath72 is defined as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the production rate of ionizing photons from the stars , @xmath75 is the distance between the ionizing cluster and the illuminated gas cloud , @xmath76 is the hydrogen number density of the gas , and @xmath77 is the speed of light . ] .",
    "given the strength of the [ neii ] and [ neiii ] lines in m82 , and their proximity in wavelength which minimises the effects of extinction , [ neiii]/[neii ] is the most reliable measure of the hardness of the radiation field .",
    "with the help of starburst models , it is possible to use the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio to estimate the ages of the massive clusters in the region .",
    "observations with iso / sws have been used previously for this purpose .",
    "@xcite determined a spatially integrated ratio of [ neiii]/[neii ] = 0.16 for the inner 500 pc of m82 . using the photoionization code cloudy and solar metallicity stellar atmosphere models by @xcite , @xcite modelled the variations of line ratios with @xmath71 .",
    "adopting an electron density @xmath78 @xmath79 and an ionization parameter log@xmath80 , @xcite found for the iso value for [ neiii]/[neii ] an effective temperature of 37400@xmath81400 k and a burst age of 4 -6 myr .",

    "independent estimations of cluster ages were done at longer wavelengths .",
    "@xcite analysed far - infrared spectra from iso / lws and fitted line ratios to a combined hii region and pdr model .",
    "their best fit model is an instantaneous starburst of 3 - 5 myr old massive stars , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "if the infrared emission peaks correspond to massive clusters of stars , we can determine their ages from the measured [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio and compare them with the above results , using the photoionization models by @xcite .",
    "as input , @xcite used massive cluster spectra modeled with starburst99 , assuming a salpeter imf , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and a gas density of @xmath84 @xmath79 .",
    "this value of gas density is a factor of three lower than the @xcite value , but this has a small effect on the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio .",
    "[ figmappings ] show the results for a range of ionization parameters .",
    "the selected regions are represented by horizontal lines .",
    "the value of log@xmath80 derived by @xcite corresponds to a ionization front speed of @xmath85 cm",
    "s@xmath86 . for a typical value of @xmath87 , the ages of the clusters in each region range from 5 - 6 myr , in agreement with the previously determined burst ages .",
    "these clusters dominate the central region of m82 and may be similar to those observed further out in m82 in the optical , studied in detail by @xcite using hst / acs , which were found to have an average age of @xmath88 myr .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ figlinemaps ] , the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio increases from 0.15 to 0.27 with increasing distance from the galactic plane of m82 .",
    "this is counterintuitive , as one might expect a harder radiation field at the location of the most luminous regions along the plane .",
    "away from the plane , a decrease of gas density , relative to the number of ionizing photons , leads to an increase of the ionization parameter , which then causes an increase of the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio , as discussed in @xcite . indeed ,",

    "the variation we observe in the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio implies a variation of a factor of five in the ionization parameter .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the gas density decreases five times faster than the radiation field which decreases as @xmath89 with @xmath75 being the distance to the ionization source .",
    "shocks could also contribute to the increase of the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio in the outflow region , but in section 4.5 we show that to be minimal .",
    "this hypothesis could be tested using the [ siii]@xmath90m/[siii]@xmath50 m .",
    "unfortunately , due to the problems reported in sec .",
    "2 , we could not derive an accurate flux for the [ siii]@xmath50 m line in both ll and lh spectra .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , even at higher angular resolution , the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio in m82 remains quite low for an active starburst .",
    "we would have expected a larger variation with higher ratios locally corresponding to younger clusters and lower elsewhere .",
    "a comparison with the iso - sws sample of starburst galaxies ( @xcite ) shows that it is actually lower than most starbursts , despite being closer and better resolved .",
    "the low [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio could be caused by an aged stellar population where the starburst activity ceased more than half a dozen myrs ago - although this possibility seems unlikely given the large amounts of molecular gas still present at the center of m82 .",
    "an edge - on view of the galaxy could also contribute to the low variation of [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio .    as a comparison",
    ", we examined the @xmath91 area with the highest [ neiii ] flux ( fig .",
    "[ figlinemaps ] ) , comparing the measured [ neii ] and [ neiii ] luminosities with the models to determine the enclosed stellar mass .",
    "a single super star cluster of 5 myr would have a cluster mass of @xmath92 which is twice the mass of the super star cluster in ngc 5253 @xcite .",
    "a single cluster in a @xmath91 area would correspond to a cluster number density of @xmath93/kpc@xmath20 , which is comparable to the cluster density found in the fossil starburst region of m82 by @xcite .    while the average age of the starburst population in m82 appears to be @xmath65 myr , ongoing star formation ( @xmath941 myr )",
    "could possibly be obscured by recent contributions of older stellar populations ( @xmath95 myr ) to the neon ratio .",
    "considering this possibility , we explore the region with the highest [ neiii ] flux , a strong indicator of the presence of o stars , as an illustrative case to set an upper limit on the ongoing star formation in m82 . this region has a [ neiii]/[neii ] of @xmath96 , with a total [ neiii ] luminosity of @xmath97 . assuming @xmath98 cm s@xmath86 , a typical young cluster of 1 myr has [ neiii]/[neii]@xmath99 and",
    "can contribute @xmath650% to the total [ neiii ] luminosity or @xmath62.5% per mass relative to the older 5@xmath1006 myr old population .",
    "this means that the 1 myr old population only emits @xmath65% of the total [ neii]+[neiii ] luminosity of the older 5@xmath1006 myr old population .",
    "even as an upper limit , this value indicates that the activity of the starburst has substantially declined relative to the high star formation rate that existed 5 myr ago .",
    "despite the reduced starburst activity , the presence of co emission all over the central region ( fig .  [ figsilicate ] ) shows that the starburst in m82 still has a large gas reservoir , as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it appears therefore unlikely that the starburst activity ceased because of lack of fuel .",
    "on the other hand , negative feedback mainly through strong stellar winds and supernovae explosions can play an important role in determining the star formation rate in starbursts .",
    "@xcite calculated a feedback timescale of @xmath101 myr , which is in good agreement with the age of the older super star clusters in the central region of m82 .",
    "in summary we find that [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio is low on average , and increases with distance from the galactic plane of m82 .",
    "the increase can be explained by an increase of the ionization parameter through a drop in gas density .",
    "the low [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio indicates that the dominant population consists of older clusters ( @xmath95 myrs ) .",
    "we can not rule out the presence of younger clusters in the central region , but at a much reduced rate ( @xmath102 ) of star formation compared to previous epochs .",
    "the large amount of molecular gas still present in the central region argues against a starvation of starburst activity , due to lack of gas .",
    "instead , we believe that negative feedback processes are responsible for the observed decline in the star formation rate .      one of the most noticeable features in the spectra in fig .",
    "[ figslsh ] is the absorption feature at @xmath103 m , caused by silicate grains .",
    "this feature can be extremely deep especially in ulirgs ( e.g * ? ? ?",

    "this decrease can be explained by several different factors : photo - destruction , abundance differences between vsgs and pahs , and different heating opacities between vsgs and pahs with a varying radiation field .",
    "decreasing pah flux with the hardening of the radiation has been observed in galactic star forming regions @xcite , on small spatial scales near the luminous clusters ( @xmath62 pc ) , where the pah destruction largely surpasses pah excitation . wether the conditions that lead to pah destruction on 2 pc scales can be maintained over much larger scales , corresponding to the resolution of our maps ( @xmath635 pc ) , can not be derived from our data , but has been observed in ngc 5253 @xcite . using the sings sample of galaxies ,",

    "<S> we find a good correlation of the dust extinction with the co 1 - 0 emission . </S>",
    "<S> the pah emission follows closely the ionization structure along the galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> the observed variations of the diagnostic pah ratios across m82 can be explained by extinction effects , within systematic uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 m pah complex is very prominent , and its equivalent width is enhanced outwards from the galactic plane . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this as a consequence of the variation of the uv radiation field . </S>",
    "<S> the ews of the @xmath5 m pah feature and the h@xmath3 s(1 ) line correlate closely , and we conclude that shocks in the outflow regions have no measurable influence on the h@xmath3 emission . </S>",
    "<S> the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio is on average low at @xmath60.18 , and shows little variations across the plane , indicating that the dominant stellar population is evolved ( 5 - 6 myr ) and well distributed . </S>",
    "<S> there is a slight increase of the ratio with distance from the galactic plane of m82 which we attribute to a decrease in gas density . </S>",
    "<S> our observations indicate that the star formation rate has decreased significantly in the last 5 myr . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities of dust and molecular gas in the central area of the galaxy argue against starvation and for negative feedback processes , observable through the strong extra - planar outflows . </S>"
