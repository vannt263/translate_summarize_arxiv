    "the self - annihilation cross section is a fundamental property of dark matter . for thermal relics",
    ", it sets the dark matter mass density , @xmath2 , and in these and more general non - thermal scenarios , also the annihilation rate in gravitationally - collapsed dark matter halos today  @xcite .",
    "there are two general constraints that bound the rate of dark matter _",
    "disappearance_. ( throughout , we mean the cross section averaged over the halo velocity distribution , i.e. , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 . )",
    "we assume that the dark matter is its own antiparticle .",
    "the first is the unitarity bound , developed for the early universe case by griest and kamionkowski  @xcite , and for the late - universe halo case by hui  @xcite . in the plane of @xmath5 and dark matter mass @xmath6 , this allows only the region below a line @xmath7 .",
    "the unitarity bound has some possible exceptions  @xcite .",
    "the second is provided by the model of kaplinghat , knox , and turner ( kkt )  @xcite , in which significant dark matter annihilation is invoked to resolve a conflict between predicted ( sharp cusps ) and observed ( flat cores ) halo profiles .",
    "( in contrast to using dark matter elastic self - scattering , as in ref .  @xcite . )",
    "since this tension may have been relaxed  @xcite , we reinterpret this type of model as an upper bound , allowing only the region below a line @xmath8 .",
    "that the kkt model requires @xmath9 values @xmath10 times larger than the natural scale for a thermal relic highlights the weakness of the unitarity bound in the interesting gev range .",
    "however , there have been no other strong and general bounds to improve upon these .",
    "( following refs .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the dark matter is somehow not a thermal relic , and hence ignore early - universe constraints , which would prohibit such large cross sections . )    while these bound the _ disappearance _ rate of dark matter , they say nothing about the _ appearance _ rate of annihilation products , instead assuming that they can be made undetectable . to evade astrophysical limits , the branching ratios to specific final states",
    "can be adjusted in model - dependent ways . however , a model - independent fact is that the branching ratios for all final states must sum to 100% .",
    "a reasonable assumption is that these final states are standard model ( sm ) particles , as it is assumed the dark matter is the lightest stable particle in the beyond - sm sector ; we generalize below .",
    "we assume that annihilation proceeds to sm particles , and express the cross section in terms of branching ratios to `` visible '' and `` invisible '' final states , such as gamma rays and neutrinos , respectively .",
    "if the branching ratio to a specific final state were known , then a bound on that appearance rate would yield a bound on the total cross section , inversely proportional to this branching ratio .",
    "however , the branching ratios are model - dependent , and any specific one can be made very small , making that bound on @xmath11 very weak , e.g. , kkt require a stringent @xmath12 to avoid exceeding the cosmic diffuse gamma - ray background  @xcite .",
    "kkt  @xcite and hui  @xcite assume invisible final states , but do not specify them . among sm final states ,",
    "it is clear that all but neutrinos will produce many more gamma rays than @xmath13 .",
    "quarks and gluons hadronize , unavoidably producing pions , where @xmath14 ; the decays of weak bosons and tau leptons also produce @xmath15 .",
    "it has been shown recently that the stable final state @xmath16 is not invisible , since it produces gamma rays either through electromagnetic radiative corrections  @xcite or energy loss processes  @xcite ; the final state @xmath17 immediately produces @xmath16 by its decays .",
    "thus the only possible  invisible \" sm final states are neutrinos . of final states with only neutrinos , we focus on @xmath18 .",
    "similar bounds could be derived for @xmath19 , but we assume that these are either suppressed and/or that the rube goldberg - ish feynman diagrams required would contain charged particles , and hence gamma rays through radiative corrections .     * upper : * diffuse @xmath18 annihilation signal for @xmath20 and @xmath21 gev , added to the atmospheric background , both as ( @xmath22 ) and versus neutrino energy . as noted , the signals are most accurate for @xmath23 .",

    "@xcite . ]    to derive our bound on the _ total _ annihilation cross section , we assume @xmath24 .",
    "this is _ not _ an assumption about realistic outcomes , but it is the right way to derive the _ most conservative _ upper bound , if only sm final states are possible .",
    "why is this a bound on the total cross section , and not just on the partial cross section to neutrinos ?",
    "because if even a small fraction of the final states were not neutrinos , they would produce gamma rays , and those flux bounds are so much more stringent that the assumed cross section would be ruled out .",
    "therefore , while setting this bound using neutrinos can be too conservative , it can never overreach .",
    "it is beyond our scope to set a more stringent bound using either direct gamma rays ( probing @xmath11 near the natural scale  @xcite ) , or those produced via radiative corrections  @xcite ; this would require specifying the branching ratios for these final states .",

    "to bound the neutrino appearance rate , we use the cosmic diffuse neutrino flux from dark matter annihilations in all halos in the universe as the signal .",
    "since this is isotropic and time - independent , it is challenging to detect above the background caused by the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "our calculations depend on the average value of density squared in the late ( clustered ) universe , and for this , we follow the calculations of refs .",
    "the formalism is summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , along with a detailed discussion of the atmospheric neutrino backgrounds  @xcite and how large of a signal perturbation is allowed .",
    "the predicted neutrino spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrumplot ] .",
    "these results can be simply checked , following some basic principles .",
    "we plotted our spectra as @xmath25 to make these points obvious , and to make estimating the integrals over energy a trivial multiplication by @xmath26 .",
    "first , since the annihilation rate scales as @xmath27 , the energy - integrated fluxes should scale as @xmath28 , and they do .",
    "second , since the redshift history is independent of dark matter mass , the spectral shapes for different masses should be the same ( @xmath25 at each energy is proportional to the number of annihilations at the corresponding redshift ) , up to the @xmath28 normalization above , and they are .",
    "third , the fluxes should be dominated by annihilation at low redshift , and they are .",
    "fourth , one can estimate the energy - integrated fluxes by multiplying the annihilation rate density by several gyr and @xmath29 , and this comes out right .",
    "we have shown that the dark matter total annihilation cross section in the late universe , i.e. , the dark matter _ disappearance _ rate , can be directly and generally bounded by the least detectable sm states , i.e. , the neutrino _ appearance _ rate .",
    "this can be simply and robustly constrained by comparing the diffuse signal from all dark matter halos to the terrestrial atmospheric neutrino background .",
    "our final bound on @xmath9 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmavplot ] . over a very large range in @xmath6 ,",
    "it is much stronger than the unitarity bound of hui  @xcite .",
    "it strongly rules out the proposal of kaplinghat , knox , and turner  @xcite to modify dark matter halos by annihilation .",
    "the only exception unique to our bound is if one postulates truly invisible non - sm final states , such as sterile neutrinos .",
    "however , the annihilations would have to proceed to _ only _ those states . for a cross section above our bound , its ratio to our bound yields a conservative constraint on the branching ratio to sm final states that one would have to require to invoke that cross section .",
    "annihilation flattens halo cusps to a core of density @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "our bound implies that for all @xmath31 gev , this density is @xmath32 , which only occurs at radii @xmath33 pc in the milky way for an nfw profile , and perhaps not at all for less steep profiles .",
    "while modeling is needed to confirm this , we expect that dark matter annihilation can not have any macroscopic effect on galactic halos , and that it is unlikely that such a strong statement could be made any other way ( for example , an argument that we made based on the radiation density  @xcite is too weak ) .",
    "detailed analyses by the super - kamiokande and amanda collaborations should be able to improve our bound by a factor 10100 over the whole mass range .",
    "halo substructure or mini - spikes around intermediate - mass black holes could increase the signal by orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity could thus become close to the natural scale for thermal relics , making it a new tool for testing even standard scenarios .",
