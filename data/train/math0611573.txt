    "variational methods based on piecewise polynomial approximations are a workhorse in numerical methods for pdes and data analysis . in particular , least - squares methods lead to the study of the @xmath0-orthogonal projection operator @xmath6 onto a given spline space @xmath7 defined on a domain @xmath8 .",
    "a question of considerable interest is the uniform boundedness of the @xmath5-norm @xmath9 of @xmath1 with respect to families of spline spaces @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath10 is a bounded interval in @xmath11 , then the question has been intensively studied for the family of spaces of smooth splines of fixed degree @xmath12 over arbitrary partitions , where shadrin @xcite has recently established that [ 1d ] p_v_l_l _ c(r ) < , r1 , for any partition .",
    "this result was known for a long time for small values of @xmath12 , e.g. , ciesielski @xcite proved that for linear splines one can take @xmath13 , while de boor @xcite solved the case @xmath14 . the estimate ( [ 1d ] ) plays an important role in numerical analysis and for the investigation of orthonormal spline systems such as the franklin system in @xmath15-based scales of function spaces , @xmath16 .    in higher dimensions ,",
    "the study of the @xmath5-norm of @xmath1 arose mostly in the context of obtaining @xmath15 error estimates in the finite element galerkin method @xcite , where sufficient conditions on the underlying partition and nodal basis @xmath17 of a finite element space @xmath7 are formulated under which the norms @xmath18 are bounded by a certain finite constant .",
    "interestingly enough , these results suggest that such conditions on partitions resp .",
    "finite element type are essential for obtaining uniform bounds but formal proof of their _ necessity _ was not given .    similarly , in the theory of multivariate splines final results on the uniform boundedness of @xmath18 could not be localized .",
    "recently , ciesielski @xcite asked about the extension of his result for linear splines @xcite to the higher - dimensional case , and the unanimous opinion of the audience was that in higher dimensions a similar result can not hold . however , other than a vague reference to unpublished work by a. a. privalov , no concrete proof could be found .",
    "it is the aim of this note to provide an elementary example of triangulations @xmath19 of a square @xmath20 into @xmath21 triangles for which [ 2d ] p_v(_j)_l_l _ j , j1 , where @xmath22 is the space of linear @xmath23 splines ( or finite element functions ) on @xmath19 ; see theorem [ prop2 ] below . as @xmath24 , the triangulations",
    "@xmath19 will not satisfy the minimum angle condition , which is natural since for these types of triangulations a uniform bound can easily be established .",
    "however , they satisfy the maximum angle condition , @xcite , and do not possess vertices of high valence . the example can easily be extended to @xmath25 , and implies that @xmath26 for all @xmath3 .",
    "we concentrate on @xmath27 , the case @xmath25 is mentioned in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "let @xmath20 be a bounded polygonal domain equipped with a finite triangulation @xmath28 into non - degenerate closed triangles @xmath29 satisfying the usual regularity condition that two different triangles may intersect at a common vertex resp .",
    "edge only .",
    "the set of vertices of @xmath28 is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the lebesgue measure of a measurable set @xmath32 .",
    "by @xmath33 we denote the minimal and maximal interior angle of all triangles in @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath34 denote the linear space of all continuous functions @xmath35 whose restriction to any of the triangles @xmath36 is a linear polynomial .",
    "any @xmath37 has a unique representation of the form [ gp ] g=_p _ g(p)_p , where the courant hat functions @xmath38 are characterized by the conditions @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is any of the remaining vertices of @xmath28 .",
    "thus , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 the set @xmath44 corresponds to the @xmath45-ring neighborhood of @xmath46 in @xmath28 , and we denote by @xmath47 the set of all neighboring vertices to @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath0-orthogonal projection of a function @xmath48 onto @xmath34 is given by the unique @xmath49 such that @xmath50 here and in the sequel , @xmath51 stands for the @xmath52 inner product .",
    "using ( [ gp ] ) with unknown nodal values @xmath53 as ansatz , this is equivalent to the linear system [ galerkin ] _ q ( _ q,_p ) x_q = ( f,_p ) p. a simple calculation shows that @xmath54 similarly , if @xmath55 is a neighbor of @xmath46 then @xmath56 in all other cases we have @xmath57 .",
    "this shows in particular that @xmath58 i.e. , if we normalize in ( [ galerkin ] ) by @xmath59 then ( [ galerkin ] ) turns into a linear system [ galerkin1 ] ax = b , x:=(x_q : q_)^t , b:=(b_p= : p_)^t , where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 satisfies [ coeff ] a_pq=\\ { 1 , & q = p , + > 0 , & q_p , + 0 , & , . and [ coeff1 ] 1=_qp a_pq=_q_p a_pq , p_. thus , the matrix @xmath62 is only weakly diagonally dominant , and not strictly diagonally dominant as in the one - dimensional case .",
    "otherwise , we could estimate @xmath63 in a trivial way , and use the inequality [ ainv ] p_v ( ) _ l_l_2a^-1 _ = 2_ay_1y _ , which follows from the above , in conjunction with the obvious equality @xmath64 .",
    "let us mention without proof that ( [ ainv ] ) implies the following partial result .    if for any two neighboring vertices @xmath65 from @xmath30 we have @xmath66 , then @xmath67    for triangulations satisfying the minimum angle condition uniformly ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath68 , this result is applicable with a @xmath69 determined solely by @xmath70 , and thus covers the bounds considered in the finite element literature @xcite .",
    "the main result of this note is the following    [ prop2 ] for any @xmath71 , there is a triangulation @xmath19 of a square into @xmath72 triangles such that the norm of the @xmath0-projector @xmath73 satisfies @xmath74 thus , for spatial dimension @xmath27 we have @xmath75    we conjecture that in terms of the number of triangles our result is asymptotically sharp for bounded polygonal domains in @xmath76 , i.e. , [ 2dj ] _ : # n p_v()_l_l _ n , n . that @xmath10 is a square is not crucial .",
    "the examples given below can easily be modified to show @xmath26 for simplicial partitions in higher dimensions as well .",
    "we will use the following notation . let @xmath77 ^ 2 $ ] be the square of side - length @xmath78 , @xmath79 , with center at the origin .",
    "set @xmath80 , with vertices denoted ( in clockwise direction ) by @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and fix the parameter @xmath83 .",
    "the triangulation @xmath19 , @xmath71 , of @xmath10 is obtained by inserting the squares @xmath84 , @xmath85 ,  , @xmath86 , whose vertices will be denoted similarly by @xmath87 , @xmath82 , @xmath88 , placing an additional vertex @xmath89 at the origin , connecting @xmath89 by straight lines with the @xmath90 vertices @xmath81 of @xmath91 , and finally subdividing each of the remaining trapezoidal regions @xmath92 into two triangles by connecting @xmath93 with @xmath87 in a consistent way .",
    "the outer rings of the resulting triangulation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] a ) .",
    "let the function @xmath94 with @xmath95 be defined as follows : @xmath96 we use the same notation as above , and consider the linear system ( [ galerkin1 ] ) corresponding to the @xmath0-orthogonal projection @xmath97 of this @xmath98 onto @xmath22 .",
    "because of uniqueness of orthogonal projections and the rotational symmetry of @xmath19 and @xmath98 , the entries of the vector @xmath99 that represent the nodal values of @xmath35 corresponding to the vertices @xmath87 , @xmath82 , are equal , and will be denoted by @xmath100 , @xmath101 ( the value at the origin is denoted by @xmath102 ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath90 equations in ( [ galerkin1 ] ) corresponding to the @xmath90 vertices of a square @xmath103 , @xmath101 , can be replaced by one , thus turning the original system @xmath104 of dimension @xmath105 into a reduced tridiagonal system @xmath106 of dimension @xmath107 for the vector @xmath108 . since the equations in the system ( [ galerkin1 ] ) are invariant under affine transformations , and because of the definition of @xmath19 via squares @xmath103 shrinking at a fixed geometric rate , it is easy to see that , with the exception of the first and last two , all equations in @xmath106 have the same form : [ reda ] x_j-1+x_j+x_j+1=(-1)^j , j=1,  ,j-1 . the coefficients can be found from the triangular neighborhood @xmath109 of any of the @xmath87 , @xmath110 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for an illustration ) , and the definitions leading to ( [ galerkin1 ] ) .",
    "we do not need their exact coefficient expressions , just their limit behavior as @xmath111 , i.e. , we will be looking for the entries of @xmath112 and @xmath113 . indeed , since for @xmath111 the whole is essentially covered by the single triangle with vertices @xmath87 , @xmath93 , @xmath114 , and since @xmath115 on the latter , we have @xmath116 from ( [ reda ] ) , we obtain in the limit @xmath111 the equations @xmath117 where @xmath118 ( the existence of these limits follows from the invertibility of the limit matrix @xmath119 , see below ) .",
    "similar considerations for the first and the last two equations of @xmath106 yield the remaining three equations of @xmath120 as follows : @xmath121 the resulting matrix @xmath119 is obviously invertible . after finding @xmath122 from the first two equations , forward substitution gives @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "this implies that for any @xmath125 one can find a sufficiently small @xmath126 such that @xmath127 this proves theorem [ prop2 ] .",
    "note that the above reasoning does not work for type - i triangulations of a square obtained from a non - uniform rectangular tensor - product partition .",
    "we conclude with the straightforward extension of the above example to arbitrary @xmath128 .",
    "let @xmath129 denote the @xmath130-th unit coordinate vector in @xmath2 , @xmath131 .",
    "as @xmath10 we take the convex polyhedral domain with vertices @xmath132 and @xmath133 , @xmath134 . for @xmath135 ,",
    "this domain is a pyramid with square base in the @xmath136-plane , and tip on the @xmath137-axis .",
    "a suitable simplicial partition of @xmath10 is obtained as follows .",
    "the base square with vertices @xmath81 , @xmath82 , is triangulated into @xmath19 which depends on the parameters @xmath138 and @xmath139 as described for @xmath27 . the resulting triangulation ( now embedded into @xmath2 ) and its vertices",
    "are again denoted by @xmath19 resp . by @xmath87 , @xmath82 , @xmath101 , and @xmath89 .",
    "then each simplex in the associated simplicial partition @xmath140 of @xmath10 is generated by the @xmath141 vertices @xmath142 , @xmath134 , and the three vertices of a triangle in @xmath19 .",
    "the latter is called base triangle of the associated simplex . obviously , the @xmath143-dimensional volume of each simplex is proportional to the @xmath144-dimensional area of its base triangle , with proportionality constant @xmath145 . to obtain a suitable function @xmath94 with @xmath95",
    "we prescribe values @xmath146 on the simplices by inheritance from the values on the base triangles of the above @xmath144-dimensional @xmath98 .    from the symmetry properties of @xmath98 and @xmath140 ,",
    "it is obvious that the @xmath0-orthogonal projection @xmath147 of @xmath98 onto the linear spline space @xmath148 is characterized by its value @xmath102 at the origin @xmath89 , by values @xmath100 taken at the vertices @xmath87 , @xmath82 , where @xmath101 , and a common value @xmath149 taken at the remaining vertices @xmath142 , @xmath134 . to estimate these values which",
    ", in complete analogy to the @xmath144-dimensional case , are represented by the solution vector @xmath150 of a certain linear system @xmath106 ( now of dimension @xmath151 ) , we need the limit version @xmath120 of this linear system for @xmath111 .",
    "we spare the reader the elementary calculations , and state it without proof : _ j + _ j-1 +  & = & ( -1)^j , j=1, ",
    ",j+1 , + 32_0 + 12_1 +  & = & - , + _ 0 + 12_1 + ( 1 + 2) & = & - . from this system one",
    "easily concludes that @xmath152 , and consequently @xmath153 for a small enough @xmath126 which implies the desired result .",
    "the lower bound @xmath154 obtained does not seem to accurately reflect the possible growth of the projector norms in @xmath5 as a function of the number of simplices , for @xmath25 we would rather expect an exponential rate .",
