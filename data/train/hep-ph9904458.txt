    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is currently believed to lead to the most attractive scenario of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , the low - energy spectrum of fermions and bosons does not exhibit this symmetry , so susy , if it exists , must somehow be broken to be of any relevance to nature .",
    "susy breaking is different from the more familiar symmetry breaking in the sm since the supertrace theorem prevents susy breaking by tree - level renormalizable couplings .",
    "according to this theorem one must assume that the sector responsible for susy breaking is hidden , i.e. it has no renormalizable tree - level couplings with the visible sector .",
    "a popular realization of this breaking can be accommodated through gravity , a theory which is altogether non - renormalizable , and this mechanism has been explored for a long time @xcite .",
    "another possibility , in which a different mechanism is used to communicate susy breaking , can be provided by keeping the original theory renormalizable , but with a low - energy description in terms of an effective lagrangian with non - renormalizable terms . within the first scenario",
    "( i.e. theories with gravity - mediated susy breaking ) soft mass terms are generated at the planck scale and one can not produce flavor - invariant susy - breaking terms for the sfermion masses . on the other hand , in the second scenario it is possible to generate soft terms at some `` messenger '' scale @xmath3 below the planck scale and to break flavor symmetry only through yukawa couplings .",
    "this can be achieved within the framework of theories which take advantage of the general mechanism of gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) @xcite in which , just as in the sm , the yukawa couplings are the only sources of flavor violation . in gmsb theories",
    "one introduces vector - like quarks and leptons whose role is to break supersymmetry .",
    "these theories have received considerable attention in recent years @xcite , largely due to their high predictability and their emphasis on a dynamical origin for susy breaking .    to carry out the gmsb program , one starts with an observable sector which contains the usual matter and gauge fields and their supersymmetric partners , while leaving the hidden sector unspecified .",
    "one then introduces a _ messenger _ sector , formed by the new superfield @xmath4 , whose coupling with the goldstino superfield generates a supersymmetric mass of order @xmath5 for the messenger fields , and leads to mass splittings of order @xmath6 ( where we denote by @xmath5 , @xmath6 the vacuum expectation values of the scalar and the auxiliary component of the superfield , respectively ) , and thus @xmath7",
    "is identified with the scale of susy breaking in the messenger sector @xcite .",
    "apart from the requirement that the messenger fields transform under the sm gauge group , the messenger sector is unknown and is the main source of model - dependence in gmsb theories .",
    "explicit model building in theories which take advantage of the gmsb mechanism has been explored in a number of papers by taking @xmath8 to be the unifying gauge group in most cases @xcite . despite serious shortcomings related to problems such as the nucleon decay rates and neutrino masses , as well as @xmath9-parity breaking ,",
    "the predictability and simplicity of these models has served as a useful first illustration of the applicability and power of the idea of gmsb .",
    "an attempt to go beyond these models was made by the authors of @xcite .",
    "they chose to study the electroweak gauge group @xmath10 since it automatically guarantees @xmath9-parity conservation .",
    "they also explored messenger fields which can play the role of the higgs fields and break the chosen gauge group down to the sm . in this work",
    "we propose to study the gmsb mechanism and its phenomenological consequences in a large class of supersymmetric @xmath0 grand unified theories ( guts ) by taking a different approach .",
    "we start with the most general messenger sector and break the @xmath0 symmetry to either @xmath11 or @xmath12 , with a subsequent breaking to the sm gauge group .",
    "we enforce the boundary condition that the gauge couplings must unify at a common scale by using the one - loop renormalization group evolution of the couplings .",
    "we use this boundary condition to restrict the messenger field masses and to predict the complete sparticle mass spectrum .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the @xmath0 model and its breaking . in section iii",
    "we introduce the @xmath11 and @xmath12 models and give their particle content . in section",
    "iv we discuss the restrictions on susy breaking and present the resulting solutions .",
    "the particle spectrum is discussed in section v. we conclude with some remarks in section vi .",
    "@xmath0 guts have received a great deal of attention over the years and continue to do so , thanks to the improved measurements of the low - energy gauge couplings which confirm that supersymmetry leads to an extremely accurate ( perturbative ) unification of couplings @xcite .",
    "also , from a more theoretical point of view , the @xmath0 gauge group is a natural candidate for supersymmetric unification since all the quarks and leptons of a single generation are the components of a single spinor representation .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 gauge group has the particularly attractive feature that it can break to the sm through either @xmath13 or @xmath14 , thus providing non - zero neutrino masses through the see - saw mechanism . due to this , and in view of the recent observations at superkamiokande @xcite which indicate non - vanishing neutrino masses , @xmath0 guts must be considered even more seriously than before .",
    "additionally , @xmath0 guts also provide interesting fermion mass relations .",
    "for example , depending on the scale of the right - handed symmetry breaking , one can predict lower bounds on neutrino masses . in this context , it was shown that @xmath0 is a realistic and natural supersymmetric grand - unified theory @xcite .",
    "yet another important feature of @xmath0 susy guts is that they make it possible to achieve the desired doublet - triplet splitting ( i.e. keeping the pair of higgs doublets of the supersymmetric sm light , while giving their colour triplet partners superheavy masses to avoid proton decay ) without fine - tuning @xcite .",
    "let us now turn our attention to @xmath0 symmetry breaking in @xmath0 susy guts .",
    "@xmath0 symmetry breaking can proceed in essentially two ways : @xmath0 can be broken to @xmath15 at scale @xmath16gev and then further broken down to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) at scale @xmath17gev . or ,",
    "alternatively , @xmath0 can be broken to some left - right symmetric group , e.g. @xmath18 , at some high energy scale , where the @xmath19 group contains the subgroup @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is then broken at some intermediate scale to the mssm .",
    "the latter possibility of breaking @xmath0 is of particular interest , since the supersymmetric left - right model can naturally account for parity and comes with the extra bonus of providing possible solutions to both the susy cp problem and the r - parity problem @xcite . in this work",
    "we will further assume the d - terms to vanish ( they could in principle contribute to the supersymmetry breaking masses ) .",
    "it can be argued that renormalizable see - saw mechanism and spontaneously broken @xmath22 symmetry lead to exact @xmath9-parity at all energies @xcite .",
    "these are important and attractive features of the left - right models , which is why we wish to study this possibility of breaking through the gmsb mechanism in more detail in this paper .",
    "the symmetry breaking chain that we study here is as follows .",
    "we assume that the @xmath0 gauge group is broken to an intermediate left - right symmetry group @xmath23 at scale @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath24 should be no less than @xmath25  gev to have stable nuclei and it should be below the planck scale @xmath26  gev .",
    "the intermediate symmetry group @xmath23 is then broken down to the mssm at scale @xmath27 . for simplicity , and to maintain only a minimal number of scales in the theory , we will assume that there are no further symmetry breaking scales between @xmath27 and @xmath24 .    as possible left - right symmetry groups we will consider @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "next we must include susy breaking into our model .    the simplest possibility which avoids the proliferation of scales is to assume that the susy breaking scale and the left - right gauge symmetry breaking scale could be somehow related .",
    "to realize this we will further assume that the susy breaking scale @xmath30 is the same as the left - right symmetry breaking scale @xmath27 . in terms of the scales introduced in the previous section ,",
    "we relate explicitly the scales as @xmath31 .",
    "this is an attractive choice since it simultaneously connects the scale of the gauge symmetry breaking to the scale of susy breaking and fulfills the requirement that the breaking of the electroweak symmetry remain radiative.in order for the sparticle masses to be around 1 tev , the susy breaking scale must be @xmath32  tev .",
    "our specification of scales leads , among other things , to an interesting scenario which involves a low right - handed scale , effects of which could be observed in precision measurements of low energy observables at lhc or nlc @xcite .    to sum up , in the symmetry breaking chains studied here",
    "we restrict the scales as follows : @xmath33    we would like to note that this particular choice of scales is in agreement with general astrophysical / cosmological bounds derived from nucleosynthesis @xcite .    in gmsb models",
    "it is the messenger fields that carry the information about susy breaking to the visible sector . in our case",
    "the messenger sector is strongly limited by the constraint that the gauge couplings must meet at scale @xmath24 and that they remain perturbative up to the planck scale .",
    "we will study these constraints and show that among all the possible choices for messenger - field contents and multiplicities only a few models remain which are consistent with all the constraints that we impose .",
    "( in view of the fact that we start out with a minimal number of scales and assumptions , this is a somewhat intriguing result and we are inclined to take these phenomenological implications to be very suggestive . ) once the messenger sector is specified , one can calculate all the susy breaking parameters of the mssm and thus make predictions for the complete mass spectrum in the mssm .",
    "as described below , we have fully carried out this program by taking the one - loop radiative effects into account .",
    "as has been mentioned above , we assume that the @xmath0 symmetry breaking proceeds through one of the intermediate left - right ( product ) gauge groups @xmath34 or @xmath35 , followed by a subsequent breaking down to the sm .",
    "let us now briefly describe the superpotentials and the particle contents in theories with these gauge groups .",
    "the model based on the gauge group @xmath36 is phenomenologically interesting because it contains all the usual matter multiplets _ plus _ the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , this model forbids lepton- and baryon - number violating terms in the superpotential , thus guaranteeing automatic @xmath9-parity conservation @xcite .",
    "the model can therefore lead to a stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) which can be a cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidate .",
    "the superpotential for the matter sector of the theory is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the messenger sector superpotential .",
    "the lepton and the quark sectors in this theory consists of the doublets @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the singlets @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and the corresponding squarks and sleptons .",
    "the two higgs doublets ( and their superpartners ) in this model are the same as in the mssm : @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "in addition to these , the model contains two @xmath47 higgs singlets @xmath48 and @xmath49 which break the @xmath50 symmetry down to the @xmath51 of the sm , together with their superpartners .",
    "the gauge sector of the the model contains the bosons @xmath52 ,  @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and the corresponding gauginos .",
    "the left - right supersymmetric model based on the gauge group @xmath55 has been studied intensively over the years @xcite .",
    "in addition to the attractive features of model  i , this model offers solutions to both the strong and weak cp problems , while at the same time preserving @xmath9-parity . as opposed to the @xmath56 model , in the @xmath57 model @xmath9-parity conservation",
    "is not automatic .",
    "however , there exist ways to avoid it being broken spontaneously @xcite .",
    "the superpotential for the matter sector of this theory is :    @xmath58 + \\mu_{ij}tr(\\tau_{2}\\phi^{t}_{i } \\tau_{2 } \\phi_{j})+w_m,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , as before , @xmath38 denotes the messenger sector superpotential .",
    "the particle content in this theory is as follows .",
    "the lepton and the quark sectors consist of the doublets @xmath59 ,  @xmath60 ,  @xmath61 ,  @xmath62 , and the corresponding superpartners .",
    "this model contains bi - doublet higgs fields @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the triplet higgs fields @xmath65 and @xmath66 which break the left - right model to the sm , as well as @xmath67 , @xmath68 ( which are required for the cancellation of anomalies in the fermionic sector ) , and their superpartners .",
    "the gauge sector consists of the bosons @xmath69 , and @xmath70 and their associated superpartners .",
    "the simplest messenger sector consists of @xmath71 flavors of chiral superfields @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 which transform in the @xmath75 representation of the gauge group . in order to preserve gauge coupling constant unification",
    ", one usually requires that the messengers form complete gut multiplets . in this case",
    "the presence of the messenger fields at an intermediate scale does not modify the value of @xmath24 .",
    "the gauge coupling strength receives an extra contribution from the messengers , at the unification scale @xmath24 which is given by @xcite : @xmath76 with @xmath77 here @xmath78 is twice the dynkin index of the @xmath79 representation of the gauge group and @xmath80 is the flavor index . by requiring that the gauge interactions remain perturbative all the way up to the gut scale @xmath24 one obtains : @xmath81    on the one hand , the minimal set of messenger fields can be relaxed and augmented further if one requires a theory sufficiently rich to be viable  for instance by requiring a reasonable set of masses for the scalars and gauginos . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of messenger fields is restricted by the requirement that the mssm couplings stay perturbative up to the gut scale and that gauge couplings unify to a single coupling at @xmath24 .",
    "the requirement of gauge unification does not provide much information on the messenger sector : indeed it is not necessary that all messenger - scale vector - like superfields obtain their masses by coupling primarily to the chiral superfield @xmath4 .",
    "the messengers that do not satisfy this condition have little effect on the mssm masses , but can still participate in gauge coupling unification .",
    "the possible messenger fields in model  i are :    @xmath82    and they transform under @xmath83 as specified by the quantum numbers in brackets .    similarly , the possible messenger fields in model  ii consist of @xmath84 which transform under @xmath85 with the quantum numbers specified in brackets .    in the following section we shall restrict the messenger sectors by requiring ( i ) the perturbativity of the gauge couplings ( @xmath86 ) up to the planck scale and ( ii ) unification at the gut scale @xmath24 .",
    "unification is the requirement that the values of the four gauge couplings be equal to a single value @xmath87 at scale @xmath24 .",
    "we use subindex `` @xmath88 '' , as opposed to `` @xmath22 '' , to denote the gut - normalized @xmath22 gauge coupling .",

    "we can eliminate the unification coupling @xmath87 from equation ( [ eq : rng3 ] ) by using constraints from equation ( [ eq : scales ] ) .",
    "we thus obtain the following limits on the differences of lr @xmath108-functions : @xmath111    the choice of messenger fields is determined by the requirement that the gauge couplings remain perturbative ( @xmath86 ) up to the planck scale , as well as by the requirement of obtaining plausible masses for all mssm particles .",
    "the requirement of the perturbativity of the gauge couplings at the scale @xmath24 and between @xmath24 and @xmath112 , together with ( [ eq : rng3 ] ) , leads to the following constraints on the left - right @xmath108-functions : @xmath113 these equations constrain the number of messenger fields , since each new chiral superfield contributes to the @xmath108-functions .",
    "the requirement that the gauge couplings unify at a specific energy scale may not always impose severe restrictions on the messenger sector , but it certainly provides for reasonable mssm masses and agrees well with the apparent experimental confirmation for gauge coupling unification at lep . using the @xmath108-functions for models i and ii ( see appendix c ) , together with the constraints ( [ eq : constrain1 ] ) and ( [ eq : constrain2 ] ) , we find that there can be no consistent solutions in model ii . in model",
    "i , on the other hand , there exist consistent solutions with the messenger multiplicities : @xmath114 we will study these possibilities in more detail and show that despite apparently having several choices , their consequences are remarkably alike for all the models specified by ( [ eq : messconstrain ] ) .    according to ( [ eq : messconstrain ] ) the messenger sector",
    "consists of one color octet ( @xmath115 ) field , one @xmath47 triplet ( @xmath116 ) field , and a pair of @xmath117- or @xmath118-type ( higgs- or lepton - like , respectively ) messenger fields ( @xmath119 ) .",

    "there are thus a total of six choices for the messenger multiplicities",
    ". however , each of these messenger sectors produces a very similar mass spectrum for the mssm , making our scheme extremely predictive .",

    "the value of the bilinear scalar coupling @xmath125 is kept fixed and @xmath126 is allowed to vary .",

    "the mismatch is much worse : @xmath93 meets the colour gauge coupling at @xmath134gev .",
    "however , this mismatch can be accounted for and explained through the threshold effects and so we will consider this model as well . finally , in left - right models the ratio : @xmath135 is a very important phenomenological parameter which is completely determined by the unification condition . here",
    "the value of @xmath136 lies in the interval @xmath137 .",

    "would affect only slightly the @xmath142 function , translating in a change of the messenger scale by a factor of 1.5 , from @xmath143 gev to @xmath144 gev , which is insignificant compared to the accuracy we are working with @xcite .",
    "given a messenger sector , and once the messenger scale and @xmath136 are fixed , one can calculate the sparticle masses in the corresponding left - right model ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the left - right model is then matched to the mssm ( appendix b ) .",
    "knowing the mssm parameters at the messenger scale , we can then calculate the full mssm particle spectrum as a function of @xmath145  @xcite .",
    "one could reduce the parameters further and solve the supersymmetric @xmath146-problem , as was done in  @xcite , by requiring that the bilinear scalar coupling @xmath147 vanish at the messenger scale .",
    "this would fix @xmath145 .",
    "however , in this work we wish to take a broader course by treating @xmath126 ( or equivalently the bilinear scalar coupling ) as a free parameter .",

    "future collider experiments can put all these predictions fully to test .    finally , let us note that although here we have studied @xmath0 guts equipped with the gmsb mechanism as the next logical choice beyond similar theories based on the @xmath8 gauge group , the supersymmetric spectrum obtained is not unlike the one obtained in gauge - mediated models with a simpler breaking chain .",
    "this raises the attractive possibility that gauge - mediated breaking imposes similar features on a variety of gut scenarios . it would certainly be interesting to study other gut scenarios with gmsb to test what appear to be general features of this mechanism",
