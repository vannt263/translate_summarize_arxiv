    "analytic models for hadron - hadron scattering are characterized by simple parametrizations for the forward amplitude @xmath6 and the use of dispersion relation techniques to study the total cross section @xmath4 and the @xmath5 parameter ( the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the amplitude ) ,    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the four - momentum transfer squared and @xmath9 the center - of - mass energy squared .    in a recent work several aspects concerning the application of the analytic models to @xmath0 and @xmath1 elastic scattering have been studied @xcite . in particular , in the case of the donnachie - landshoff parametrization , investigation of discrepant estimations for the total cross sections from cosmic - ray experiments allowed to infer an upper bound for the soft pomeron intercept , namely , @xmath10 . in addition , the effects of global vs individual fits to @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the effects of the subtraction constant in the dispersion relations have also been analyzed and discussed .    in this report we extend the previous analysis in several ways , with focus on new upper / lower bounds for the soft pomeron intercept : ( 1 ) we investigate the effect of discrepant values for @xmath4 from accelerator experiments at @xmath11 tev , by selecting different ensembles of data that include either the highest ( cdf ) or the lowest ( e710/e811 ) results ; ( 2 ) these ensembles are then combined with discrepant estimations for @xmath4 from cosmic - ray experiments , now using as the lowest estimations the results by block , halzen , and stanev ; ( 3 ) we use here , as a framework , an extended parametrization with non - degenerate @xmath12 and @xmath13 meson trajectories . as in the previous analysis",
    "we also present the effects of individual and global fits to @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the effect of the subtraction constant .",
    "since the soft pomeron exchange dominates the high energy behavior of the total cross sections and the @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering correspond to the highest energy interval with available data ( including information from cosmic - ray experiments ) , we shall limit our analysis to these processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the essential formula of the analytic approach with the extended regge parametrization are presented . in sec .",
    "iii the discrepancies at both accelerator and cosmic - ray domains are reviewed , and it the fit results through four different ensembles of experimental information are presented .",
    "the conclusions and some final remarks are the contents of sec .",
    "the forward effective regge amplitude introduced by donnachie and landshoff has two contributions , one from a single pomeron and the other from secondary reggeons exchanges@xcite .",
    "the model assumes degeneracies between the secondary reggeons , imposing a common intercept for the @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and the @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) trajectories .",
    "this was the parametrization adopted in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "although the original fits by donnachie and landshoff have been performed only to the @xmath4 data , more recent analysis , treating global fits to @xmath4 and @xmath5 , have indicated that the best results are obtained with non - degenerate meson trajectories @xcite . in this case",
    "the forward scattering amplitude is decomposed into three reggeon exchanges , @xmath18 where the first term represents the exchange of a single pomeron , the other two the secondary reggeons and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) for @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) amplitudes . using the notation @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the intercepts of the pomeron and the @xmath14 and @xmath16 trajectories , respectively , the total cross sections , eq .",
    "( 1 ) , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions are written as @xmath24    the connection with the @xmath5 parameter is obtained by means of dispersion relations and for the above parametrization convergence is ensured by using analyticity relations with one subtraction . defining @xmath25",
    "these relations read @xcite    @xmath26 \\frac{\\textrm{im}\\ f_{+}(s)}{s } , \\qquad \\textrm{re}\\ f_{-}(s ) = \\tan \\left [ \\frac{\\pi}{2 } \\frac{d}{d\\ln s } \\right ]   \\textrm{im}\\ f_{-}(s ) ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is the subtraction constant . within this formalism ,",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) lead to the following connection between @xmath28 and @xmath29 :    @xmath30",
    "the experimental information on @xmath0 and @xmath1 total cross sections at the highest energies are characterized by discrepant results .",
    "as is well known , in the accelerator region , the conflit concerns the results for @xmath2 at @xmath31 tev reported by the cdf collaboration @xcite and those reported by the e710 @xcite and the e811 @xcite collaborations ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in the cosmic - ray region ,",
    "@xmath32 tev , the discrepancies are due to both experimental and theoretical uncertainties in the determination of @xmath3 from p - air cross sections .",
    "the situation has been recently reviewed in detail in our previous paper @xcite , where a complete list of references , numerical results and discussions are presented . as showed there , the highest predictions for @xmath3 concern the result by gaisser , sukhatme , and yodh @xcite together with those by nikolaev @xcite . in the other extreme ,",
    "the lowest values come from the results by block , halzen , and stanev @xcite .",
    "these extrema estimations are displayed in fig .",
    "1 ( numerical values may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "although , in principle , all available data in the accelerator region could be used , it should be stressed that the difference between the cdf and the e710/e811 results involves two standard deviations @xcite .",
    "this strong disagreement certainly indicates the possibility of distinct scenarios for the rise of the total cross section and consequently for the value of the pomeron intercept .",
    "moreover , despite the large error bars in the extracted values of @xmath3 from cosmic - ray experiments , the discrepancies also presented can corroborate the distinction between the different scenarios .",
    "it is expected that answers to these questions will be provided by the new values for @xmath4 and @xmath5 coming from the bnl rhic , the fermilab tevatron - run ii and the cern lhc .        since recent analysis showed that the parameters of regge fits are stable for a cutoff @xmath33 gev @xcite , in what follows we consider experimental data on @xmath4 and @xmath5 above @xmath34 gev .",
    "we use the data sets compiled and analyzed by the particle data group @xcite , to which we add the new e811 data on @xmath4 and @xmath5 at @xmath11 tev @xcite .",
    "the statistic and systematic errors have been added in quadrature .    in order to investigate the effects of the discrepancies in a quantitative way , we select different ensembles of @xmath4 data that include all the @xmath5 results above @xmath35 gev .",
    "first we only consider accelerator data in two ensembles with the following notation : ensemble * i * : @xmath36 and @xmath37 data ( @xmath38 gev ) + cdf datum ( @xmath39 tev ) ; ensemble * ii * : @xmath36 and @xmath37 data ( @xmath38 gev ) + e710/e811 data ( @xmath39 tev ) .",
    "ensemble i represents the faster increase scenario for the rise of @xmath4 from accelerator data and ensemble ii the slowest one .",
    "these ensembles are then combined with the highest and lowest estimations for @xmath3 from cosmic - ray experiments , namely , the nikolaev and gaisser , sukhatme , and yodh ( ngsy ) results and the block , halzen , and stanev ( bhs ) results , respectively .",
    "these new ensembles are denoted by ensemble * i + ngsy * and ensemble * ii + bhs*.    as in the previous paper , we consider both individual fits to @xmath4 , and simultaneous fits to @xmath4 and @xmath5 , either in the case where the subtraction constant is considered as a free fit parameter or assuming @xmath40 in eq . ( 3 ) .",
    "the fits have been performed with the program cern - minuit and the errors in the fit parameters correspond to an increase of the @xmath41 by one unit .    in the case of accelerator data only the fit results for @xmath4 and @xmath5 with ensembles i and ii are displayed in table i and figs . 2 , 3 and 4 . the results concerning the combination of these ensembles with the estimations from cosmic - ray experiments , namely , ensembles i + ngsy and ii + bhs , are shown in table ii and figs . 5 , 6 and 7 . in the last two cases we present the curves and experimental information in the region from @xmath42 gev to @xmath43 tev , since the results are the same at lower energies , as can be seen in the corresponding results for @xmath28 .",
    "in this work we have presented all the possible fits to @xmath0 and @xmath1 data , above @xmath35 gev , through the extended regge parametrization , exploring the contrasting data and the faster and the slower increase scenarios for the rise of the total cross section , allowed by the experimental information presently available .    from table iii ,",
    "our results exclude the values for the pomeron intercept obtained by cmg ( in the case of the eikonal parametrization ) , the lower bounds by alm and janik and the mean value by the cdf collaboration .",
    "the dl result is barely compatible with our lower limit .",
    "it should be noted that , if the same ensemble is fitted , the introduction of nondegenerate trajectories results in a slightly increase of the pomeron intercept .",
    "for example , fit to all the accelerator data above @xmath35 gev ( including the cdf and the e710/e811 values ) , leads to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , in the cases of degenerate ( dl ) and nondegenerate parametrizations , respectively .    from figures ( 2 ) to ( 7 ) , we see that in all the cases investigated the @xmath5 parameter is better described with ensembles i and i + bhs , a result that is also roughly supported by the @xmath41/dof ( tables i and ii ) .",
    "we understand that this picture favors the e710/e811 results .",
    "this conclusion is contrary to that obtained by cmg @xcite and more recently by the compete collaboration @xcite .    as a next step it may be important to investigate the consequences of the above extrema bounds in fittings to @xmath46-mesons , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 scattering , with focus in the ratio of strengths of the pomeron exchange ( quark counting and factorization ) .",

    ". 00/00991 - 7 , and no . 00/04422 - 7 ) and to p. valin , j. montanha neto , and a. f. martini for discussions .",
    "we are also grateful to m. m. block for sending us the total cross section results concerning the bhs analysis ."
