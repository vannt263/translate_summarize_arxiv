    "the recently and long - awaited direct detection of a gravitational waves source ( gw150914 ) by the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) collaboration with the virgo collaboration @xcite was shown to be consistent with numerical simulations of the merger of a black hole ( bh ) binary system with masses @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it has been already stressed that this result is groundbreaking in several respects : it shows that binaries of gravitationally collapsed objects exist and merge within the age of the universe .",
    "the merger of binary supermassive bhs has been shown by a number of numerical simulations @xcite to produce a collimated electromagnetic flash accompanying the gw event",
    ". however , standard scalings in the pioneeristic work by @xcite are inconsistent with the large luminosity ( @xmath3 erg@xmath4s ) of the transient signal detected by gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) on board the _ fermi _ satellite at photon energy @xmath5 kev @xcite , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "owing to the exceptional impact of such an association , it seems worth exploring at least qualitatively a possible scenario for the joint events as already done , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the widely accepted blanford - znajek mechanism envisages supermassive rotating bhs ( typically @xmath6 ) powering electromagnetic jets with luminosity @xmath7 erg@xmath4s and with circum - bh disks currents sustaining a magnetic field near the bh of order of @xmath8 gauss .",
    "the luminosity of the gbm transient combined with @xmath9 bhs makes the association of gw150914 with the gbm transient unlikely as it would imply implausibly high magnetic fields .",
    "we propose that the compenetration of the two magnetospheres amplifies by orders of magnitude the magnetic energy and drive , through reconnection , the release of a relativistically hot and optically thick pair plasma .",
    "we argue in this short note that the latter scenario might be a commonplace electromagnetic source associated with merger of collapsed objects .",
    "the source of gw 150914 very likely comprises of two objects at the final stage of their gravitational collapse , close to their respective horizons , inspiralling and moving at a good fraction of the speed of light . even if only mass ( @xmath10 ) , charge ( @xmath11 ) and spin ( @xmath12 ) are bhs observables , it is customary to assume that stationary bhs in the universe have no substantial charge ( @xmath13 in geometric units ) for a far - away observer .",
    "we allow for each of the collapsing objects to carry a non - vanishing global electric charge @xmath13 and spin angular momentum @xmath12 .",
    "we have no argument to support that the charge can not be quenched as it is customarily assumed ; we merely examine here the consequences of a magnetosphere supported by an intrinsic electric charge during the inspiral . if the two spins @xmath12 are anti - aligned and approximately orthogonal to the orbital plane , the compression of the anti - parallel magnetic field lines within the current sheet separating the two magnetospheres will drive a violent turbulent magnetic reconnection , which can eject a relativistically hot pair plasma that later emits the hard @xmath0-rays signal detected by fermi .",
    "the problem of gravitational collapse of an electrically charged and spherically symmetric shell has been long investigated @xcite .",
    "astrophysical implications of a charged collapsing object have been explored in the past two decades in connection with grbs prompt and afterglow high - energy light curves ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and @xmath14 and @xmath15-ray band spectral evolution @xcite .    for a stationary isolated kerr - newman bh , it is well - known that , upon developing the general relativistic solution in a far - away observer rest frame , the leading components to order @xmath16 of the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor @xmath17 behave , as for the magnetic field @xmath18 , as magnetic dipole : @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the angular momentum of spin per mass unit and @xmath23 are @xcite coordinates .",
    "the space - time geometry within a binary bh circular orbit is accessible only through numerical simulations and an analytical formulation is not known to date and possibly inexistent .",
    "our first ansatz is that the magnetic dipole structure is approximately preserved within the inspiralling orbit .",
    "turbulent magnetic reconnection has been repeatedly invoked in the past decade to explain the production of non - thermal particles populations , beside thermal heating , for those observations that were not complying with time - space constraints of well - understood mechanisms or with ideal mhd , traditionally in solar flares @xcite and more recently in the intensity peak of energetic particles at solar termination shock @xcite , and in relativistic astrophysical outflows ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we argue that , during the last phase of the magnetospheres coalescence , turbulent compenetration at the current sheet layer dissipates magnetic energy into relativistically hot thermal pair plasma and non - thermal particles ejected in a highly collimated relativistic outflow .",
    "a cartoon illustration in fig .",
    "[ fig ] shows the current sheet layer that ejects the thermal pair plasma into the downstream cone along @xmath24-axis .",
    "the electric field @xmath25 accelerates particles ( electrons along @xmath26 and positrons along @xmath27 ) as long as the particles remain confined within the boundary layer and gives rise to a non - thermal distribution ( see , e.g. , recent simulations of relativistic reconnection in flat space - time in @xcite ) .",
    "assuming @xmath28 does not alter the main process in this simplified scenario .    the relativistic highly collimated thermal plasma of pairs electron - positrons and photons outflowing the reconnecting region will propagate ( bulk lorentz @xmath29 ) as far as the plasma rest frame opacity of the high - energy @xmath15-ray to the electron - positron pair production drops to @xmath30 ( as discussed for grbs in @xcite )",
    "; at this point the electromagnetic radiation is released in a single pulse detected at earth as the gbm transient of arrival time @xmath31 duration given by @xmath32 sec .",
    "the gw signal emitted at the binary merger travels undisturbed presumably at the speed of light with infinite mean free path .",
    "it has been already estimated @xcite that the observed arrival time delay @xmath33 is compatible with a distance travelled by an ultra - relativistic plasma ( @xmath29 ) of order of @xmath34 cm . at such a distance from the coalescence location ,",
    "much larger than the clean circum - merger medium , the ejected plasma emits the gbm flash .",
    "axis and charged particles that move back and forth across the reconnection layer while being accelerated by @xmath25 along the speiser orbits . [ fig],width=340 ]",
    "the scenario qualitatively described above requires obviously a detailed demonstration through analytic estimates or extended resistive general relativistic mhd simulations .",
    "we only argue here that the process of magnetic reconnection at the compenetration of magnetospheres of compact objects might be considerable source of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the reconnection growth rate in force - free relativistic reconnection @xcite can be cast as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the alfvn time - scale and @xmath37 the resistive time - scale , both measured in the local lorentz frame . by using the estimate of @xmath15 for magnetars magnetosphere @xcite",
    ", one can approximate the reconnection rate for a current sheet thickness of @xmath38 cm as @xmath39 the time - scale @xmath40 is measured in the local reference frame of the reconnecting layer ; thus , it does not account for the gravitational redshift in the unknown space - time geometry ( we remind that the frequency at the observer frame @xmath41 is shifed from the frequency in the source frame @xmath42 by a factor @xmath43 , for the schwarzschild metric , that can be very small close to the horizon ) , the dilation of @xmath40 due to gravitational redshift is weaker . ] .",
    "however , on the very short merging time - scale due to highly relativistic flow speed involved , the actual reconnection can be limited to a current sheet thickness @xmath44 cm , greatly reducing @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the conversion of @xmath40 to the observer frame is also affected by doppler shift ( @xmath45 $ ] , where @xmath46 is the source speed and @xmath47 is the angle of the direction of photon emission with respect to the line of sight to the observer located far away from the source ) , arrival time dilation due to the fact that two photons emitted with a certain time - lag @xmath48 in the plasma comoving frame are detected with a different time - lag by the observer at earth @xmath33 because the source is moving ( @xmath49 ) and cosmological redshift ( @xmath50 for gw150914 ) . as an order of magnitude estimate , a radiation pulse emitted when the pair plasma at @xmath29 reaches transparency can easily produce a pulse @xmath1 sec delayed from gw150914 @xcite .    by assuming that the magnetic field @xmath51 upstream of the reconnecting current sheet inflows at speed @xmath52 in the late merging phase near the horizon ( @xmath53 ) , one can equate @xmath54 to the gbm transient luminosity ( @xmath55 erg@xmath4s ) ; the resulting magnetic field of order @xmath56 gauss is not unusual for magnetars although it rules out magnetic field sustained by an accretion disk in a configuration _  _",
    "la @xcite .    in this treatment",
    "the value of the @xmath57 is not relevant as long as the merging magnetospheres can be sustained during the coalescence process .",
    "also , we did not discuss here the process leading to the formation of the collapsing rotating stars . before the detection of gw150914 ,",
    "binary bhs were not deemed to exist in reality : models of gravitational collapse of massive stars in an already formed binary system and model of coalescence of two bhs moving one with respect to the other with a sufficiently small impact parameter have both unresolved issues .",
    "we have used here magnetosphere of a kerr - newman bh for an object close to the final stage of its gravitational collapse .",
    "it is expected that in the local lorentz frame where the reconnecting magnetic field lines come close to each other , the current sheet layer is dragged along the orbital motion of the compact objects and stretched by differential rotation , developing strong shear instabilities ( see @xcite for the shear instability for an isolated neutron star ) . those instabilities will presumably grow faster and faster as the system merge .",
    "a noteworthy caveat on the scenario here proposed is that the current modelling of turbulent magnetic reconnection is still under development .",
    "moreover , _ in situ _ solar wind measurements @xcite did not confirm that field dissipation efficiently transfers magnetic energy to a non - thermal particle population in non - relativistic flows .",
    "however , several recent numerical experiments seemingly support that reconnection produces energetic particles power - laws in various astrophysical contexts @xcite .",
    "this scenario will be further investigated within either the framework of tearing mode instabilities , or petschek model of two slow mode shocks @xcite , both cases in the incompressible regime as usually assumed in the literature .",
    "we hope that the scenario here proposed for the claimed association of the directly detected gw signal with a hard @xmath0-ray transient signal , and the expected future joint detections , will stimulate fresh thoughts and prompt detailed resistive general relativity numerical investigations .",
    "we acknowledge useful comments and feedbacks by d. arnett , m. begelman , m. rees , l. rezzolla , b. zhang .",
