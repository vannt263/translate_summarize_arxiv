    "the theoretical framework introduced in this paper can be applied in general to a broad variety unstable systems , however , the focus is on meson - antimeson systems and their information theoretic interpretations of certain quantum features of single and bipartite ( entangled ) systems . in particular , we discuss meson - antimeson systems , e.g. the neutral k  meson or b  meson system , which are very suitable to discuss various quantum foundation issues ( see e.g. refs  @xcite ) .",
    "neutral kaons are popular research objects in particle physics as they were the first system that was found to violate the @xmath0 symmetry ( @xmath1charge conjugation ; @xmath2 parity ) , i.e. the imbalance of matter and antimatter .",
    "they are also well suited to investigate a possible violation of the @xmath3 symmetry ( @xmath4 time reversal ) ; see e.g. refs .  @xcite .",
    "neutral meson  antimeson systems are oscillating and decaying two - state systems and can also described as bipartite entangled systems opening the unique possibility to test various aspects of quantum mechanics also for systems not consisting of ordinary matter and light .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "firstly to enlighten that these systems provide different insights into quantum theory which are not available in other quantum systems via exploring e.g. the heisenberg uncertainty relation in its entropic formulation or bell inequalities which prove that there are correlations stronger than those obtainable in classical physics .",
    "secondly , we introduce a comprehensive and simple mathematical framework which is close to the usual framework to handle stable systems and , therefore , allows for developing novel tools and potential applications .    in section [ timeevolution ]",
    "we introduce how the time evolution of neutral kaons are usually obtained . in section [ acceleratorfacilities ]",
    "we discuss what kind of questions can be raised to the quantum system at accelerator facilities and what is measured at such facilities . in particular , we outline that there are two different measurement procedures not available to other quantum systems",
    ". then the effective formulation of the observables corresponding to a certain question raised to the quantum system is introduced ( section [ effectiv ] ) , which is our main result .",
    "then we analyze different measurement settings and their uncertainty ( section [ heisenberg ] ) .",
    "in particular , we show that @xmath0 violation introduces an uncertainty in the observables of the mass eigenstates and , herewith , in the dynamics .",
    "last but not least we proceed to bipartite entangled systems and present the generalized bell  chsh inequality for meson  antimesons systems  @xcite in a witness form ( section [ bi ] ) .",
    "this allows to derive the maximal and minimal bound of the bell inequality by simply computing the eigenvalues of the effective bell operator , i.e. without relaying on optimizations over all possible initial states .",
    "the phenomenology of oscillation and decay of meson - antimeson systems can be described by nonrelativistic quantum mechanics effectively , because the dynamics are rather depending on the observable hadrons than on the more fundamental quarks .",
    "a quantum field theoretical calculation showing negligible corrections can e.g. be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "neutral meson @xmath5 are bound states of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "as numerous experiments have revealed the particle state @xmath5 and the antiparticle state @xmath6 can decay into the same final states , thus the system has to be handled as a two state system similar to spin @xmath7 systems .",
    "in addition to being a decaying system these massive particles show the phenomenon of flavor oscillation , i.e. an oscillation between matter and antimatter occurs . if e.g. a neutral meson is produced at time @xmath8 the probability to find an antimeson at a later time is nonzero .",
    "the most general time evolution for the two state system @xmath9 including all its decays is given by an infinite  dimensional vector in hilbert space @xmath10 denote all decay products and the state is a solution of the schrdinger equation ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an infinite - dimensional hamiltonian operator .",
    "there is no method known how to solve this infinite set of coupled differential equations affected by strong dynamics .",
    "the usual procedure is based on restricting to the time evolution of the components of the flavour eigenstates , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "then one uses the wigner - weisskopf approximation and can write down an effective schrdinger equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a two dimensional state vector and @xmath18 is a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "any non - hermitian hamiltonian can be written as a sum of two hermitian operators @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the mass - operator , covering the unitary part of the evolution and the operator @xmath22 describes the decay property . the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the effective schrdinger equation , we denote by @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "for neutral kaons the first solution ( with the lower mass ) is denoted by @xmath25 , the short lived state , and the second eigenvector by @xmath26 , the long lived state , as there is a huge difference between the two decay constants @xmath27 .",
    "certainly , the state vector is not normalized for times @xmath28 due to the non- hermitian part of the dynamics .",
    "different strategies have been developed to cope with that .",
    "we present here one which is based on the open quantum formalism , i.e. we show that the effect of decay is a kind of decoherence .    in quantum information theory and in experiments",
    "one often has to deal with situations where the system under investigation unavoidable interacts with the environment which is in general inaccessible . in this case",
    "only the joint system evolves according to the schrdinger equation , it is unitary .",
    "the dynamics of the system of interest then is given by ignoring all degrees of freedom of the environment , by tracing them out .",
    "such systems are called open quantum systems and under certain assumptions they may be described by a so called master equation .    in ref .  @xcite the authors showed that systems with non - hermitian hamiltonians generally can be described by a master equation .",
    "as time evolves the kaon interacts with an environment which causes the decay . in our case",
    "the environment plays the role as the qcd vacuum in quantum field theory , but has not to be modeled , only the generators have to be defined describing the effect of the interaction . in particular the time evolution of neutral kaons",
    "can be described by the master equation ( found by lindblad @xcite and , independently , by gorini , kossakowski and sudarshan @xcite ) @xmath29-\\cal{d}[\\rho]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dissipator under the assumption of complete positivity and markovian dynamics has the well known general form @xmath30=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_j ( { \\cal a}_j^\\dagger{\\cal a}_j\\rho+\\rho{\\cal a}_j^\\dagger{\\cal a}_j-2 { \\cal a}_j\\rho{\\cal a}_j^\\dagger)$ ] with @xmath31 are the generators . the density matrix @xmath32 lives on @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes `` surviving '' and `` decaying '' or `` final '' components , and has the following decomposition @xmath35 where @xmath36 with @xmath37 denote @xmath38 matrices .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath39 is the mass matrix @xmath21 of the effective hamiltonian @xmath18 extended to the total hilbert space @xmath40 and @xmath22 of @xmath41 defines a lindblad operator by @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43 rewriting the master equation for @xmath32 , eq .",

    "@xcite ) . by construction the time evolution of @xmath45 is independent of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "further @xmath48 completely decouples from @xmath45 and thus can without loss of generality be chosen to be zero since they are not physical and can never be measured .",
    "with the initial condition @xmath49 the time evolution is _ solely _ determined by @xmath45as expected for a spontaneous decay process  and formally given by integrating the components of eq .",
    "( [ rhoff ] ) .",
    "it proves that the decay is markovian and moreover completely positive .    explicitly , the time evolution of a neutral kaon is given in the lifetime basis , @xmath50 , by ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) : @xmath53 note that , formally , one also obtains off  diagonal contributions in the @xmath47 component , but as they can not be measured we set them to zero without loss of generality .",
    "the extension to bipartite systems is straightforward , i.e. by @xmath54 but we will not need to use that as our introduced effective formalism for single particles ( section [ effectiv ] ) generalizes simply for any multipartite systems , i.e. as in the usual way by simple tensor products .",
    "there are obviously two different questions that _ in principle _ can be raised to the quantum system evolving in time :    * are you a certain quasispin @xmath55 at a certain time @xmath56 or not ? * or : are you a certain quasispin @xmath55 or its orthogonal state @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) at a certain time @xmath56 ?    where we denote by a quasispin @xmath59 any superposition of the mass eigenstates which are the solutions of the effective schrdinger equation ( [ schroedi ] ) .    for non - decaying systems these questions are equivalent , but",
    "for decaying systems the second one means that you ignore all cases in which the neutral kaons decayed before the measurement , thus one does not take all information available into account . for studying certain quantum properties of these systems neglecting this kind of information",
    "is of no importance , however , e.g. if one is interested to show that there exists no explanation in terms of local hidden parameters for bipartite entangled decaying states , one is not allowed to selected only the surviving pairs , because one would not test the whole ensemble ( consult refs  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "let us here also remark on what is meant by a measurement at a certain time @xmath56 .",
    "indeed , one does not measure time , but a certain final decay product or an interaction taking place at a certain position , point in space , in the detector . to be more precise",
    "one detects often only secondary reaction products and with the energy - momentum signature reconstructs the final states . knowing the production point and thus the distance traveled as well as the momentum one can infer the proper time passed between production and decay or interaction .",
    "there are in principle two different options which are denoted as an _ active _ measurement procedure and a _ passive _ measurement procedure , for reasons which may become clear in a moment , how to obtain the quasispin content of neutral mesons .",
    "this is a remarkable difference and gives raise to two further options of quantum erasure @xcite proving the very concept of a quantum eraser , i.e. sorting events to different available information .",
    "this kaonic quantum eraser is also in the future work programme of the upgraded kloe detector which will start in 2011 ( for a detailed program see ref .",
    ".    for neutral kaons there exist two physical alternative bases .",
    "the first basis is the strangeness eigenstate basis @xmath60 .",
    "it can be measured by inserting along the kaon trajectory a piece of ordinary matter . due to strangeness conservation of the strong interactions the incoming state",
    "is projected either onto @xmath61 by @xmath62 or onto @xmath63 by @xmath64 , @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "here nucleonic matter plays the same role as a two channel analyzer for polarized photon beams .",
    "alternatively , the strangeness content of neutral kaons can be determined by observing their semileptonic decay modes ( see eq.([semileptonic - decays ] ) ) . obviously , the experimenter has no control over the kaon decay process , neither of the mode nor of the time .",
    "the experimenter can only sort at the end of the day all observed events in proper decay modes and time intervals .",
    "we call this procedure opposite to the _ active _ measurement procedure described above a _ passive _ measurement procedure of strangeness .    the second basis @xmath67 consists of the short and long  lived states having well defined masses @xmath68 and decay widths @xmath69 , which are the solution of the hamiltionian under investigation",
    ". it is the appropriate basis to discuss the kaon propagation in free space , because these states preserve their own identity in time . due to the huge difference in",
    "the decay widths the short lived states @xmath25 decay much faster than the long lived states @xmath26 . thus in order to observe if a propagating kaon is a @xmath25 or @xmath26 at an instant time @xmath70 , one has to detect at which time it subsequently decays .",
    "kaons which are observed to decay before @xmath71 have to be identified as short lived states @xmath25 , while those surviving after this time are assumed to be long lived states @xmath26 .",
    "misidentifications reduce only to a few parts in @xmath72 ( see also refs .",
    "note that the experimenter does not care about the specific decay mode , she or he records only a decay event at a certain time .",
    "this procedure was denoted as an _ active _ measurement of lifetime .",
    "neutral kaons are famous in particle physics as they violate the @xmath0 symmetry , where @xmath73 stands for charge conjugation , i.e. interchanging a particle with an antipartice state and @xmath74 for parity .",
    "so far no violation of the combined symmetry @xmath3 has been found .",
    "conservation of the @xmath3 symmetry requires that the time reversal symmetry @xmath75 has to be broken .",
    "the break of the @xmath75 invariance is far from being straightforwardly to be proven experimentally , because for a decay progress @xmath76 practical considerations prevent one from creating the time reversed sequence @xmath77 .",
    "the cplear collaboration was able to experimentally prove the @xmath75 violation .",
    "at the first side it might be surprising that one finds a @xmath75 violation in a framework which is completely controlled by non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the apparent paradox is resolved by remembering that the dynamics of a quantum system is given by the equation of motions and the boundary conditions . in particular",
    ", the fact that the relative weights of the mass eigenstates are different for the states of the two strangeness states leads to the observable effects . or differently stated the @xmath75 violation follows from the @xmath78 asymmetry in the initial states .",
    "certainly , to understand and handle these symmetry violations we have to use the framework provided by relativistic quantum field theories . the author of ref .",
    "@xcite argued that the measured @xmath75 violation at accelerator facilities introduce destructive interference between different paths that the universe can take through time , she concludes that only two possible paths are surviving , one forward in time , the other one backward in time .    since the neutral kaon system violates the @xmath79 symmetry ( which will be discussed in section [ cp ] ) the mass eigenstates are not strictly orthogonal , @xmath80 .",
    "however , neglecting @xmath79 violation it is of the order of @xmath72 the @xmath25 s are identified by a @xmath81 final state and @xmath26 s by a @xmath82 final state .",
    "one denotes this procedure as a _ passive _ measurement of lifetime , since the kaon decay times and decay channels used in the measurement are entirely determined by the quantum nature of kaons and can not be in any way influenced by the experimenter .",
    "we have introduced two conceptually different procedures _active _ and _ passive_ to measure two different observables of the neutral kaon systems : strangeness or lifetime .",
    "the @xmath83 measurement of strangeness is monitored by strangeness conservation in strong interactions while the corresponding _ passive _ measurement is assured by the @xmath84 rule , i.e. the change of the strangeness number and the change of the charge in a process . _",
    "active _ and _ passive _ lifetime measurements are efficient thanks to the smallness of @xmath85 and the @xmath78 violation parameter , respectively . this will be deeper analyzed in terms of the heisenberg uncertainty relation in the entropic version in section  [ heisenberg ] .",
    "_ active _ measurements are possible due to a huge difference in lifetime of the two mesons and , therefore , in practice are available .",
    "thus the neutral kaon system is special concerning its natural constance of the dynamic and , therefore , we mostly stick to this system .",
    "the set of _ passive _ measurements is not solely limited to the two above described basis choices , but are all possible decay modes of neutral mesons which e.g. single out different @xmath78 violation mechanisms .",
    "these decay modes can always be related to a certain quasispin at the moment of decay .",
    "let us assume we find the final state @xmath86 at a time @xmath56 and we produced at time @xmath87 a quasispin @xmath88 , the decay rate which is the derivative of the probability is given as an integral over the amplitude squared @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the transition operator and the integral is taken over the phase space . to connect the quasipin with the final state",
    ", we have to require @xmath91 and therefore any final decay product corresponds to a certain quasispin , i.e. a certain superposition of the mass eigenstates , e.g. a two pion event corresponds to the quasispin latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath171 are the mean square deviations . choosing , the operators , position @xmath172 and momentum @xmath173 , the robertson relation turns into the famous heisenberg relation @xmath174    the maximal value of the right hand side of the entropic uncertainty relation",
    "is obtained for @xmath175 and @xmath176 . in general a non - zero value of the right hand side of eq.([equi",
    "] ) means that the two observables do not commute , i.e. it quantifies the complementarity of the observables .",
    "the binary entropies on the left hand side quantify the gain of information on average when we learn about the value of the random variable associated to @xmath168 .",
    "alternatively , one can interpret the entropy as the uncertainty _ before _ we obtain the result of the random variable .",
    "the reformulation of the heisenberg relation ( [ equi ] ) has besides its different information - theoretic interpretation and its stronger bound  @xcite the advantage that the right hand side of the inequality is independent of the prepared state and only depends on the eigenvectors of the observables , hence puts a stronger limit on the extent to which the two observables can be simultaneously peaked .",
    "remarkably , the right hand side of the entropic uncertainty relation also does not depend on the eigenvalues ( except to test the non - degeneracy ) , this means that if the state is prepared in an eigenstate say of @xmath168 then the two eigenvalues of @xmath177 are equally probable as measured values , i.e. the exact knowledge of the measured value of one observable implies maximal uncertainty of the measured value of the other , independent of the eigenvalues .",
    "particle detectors at accelerator facilities detect or reconstruct different decay products at different distances from the creation point , usually by a _",
    "passive _ measurement procedure , more rarely by an _",
    "active _ measurement procedure .",
    "let us here discuss what is learnt by finding a certain quasispin @xmath55 at a certain time @xmath56 or not which can correspond to a certain decay channel , compared to the situation to find a @xmath88 at the creation point @xmath178 or not .",
    "certainly , this result also quantifies our uncertainty _ before _ we learn the result ( yes , no ) at @xmath56 and ( yes , no ) at @xmath179 . in particular , if we compare observables of same quasispin at different time , we obtain the uncertainty due to the time evolution",
    ".    differently stated , we can view it in the following way  @xcite , two experimenters , alice and bob , choose two different measurements corresponding to the observables @xmath180 .",

    "she wants to minimize her uncertainty about bob s measurement result .",
    "alice s result is bounded by the equation  ( [ equi ] ) .    in case of unstable systems the right hand side of the entropic uncertainty relation ( [ equi ] ) , for which we have to find the maximum , is given by @xmath183 with @xmath184 and @xmath185 being the eigenvectors of the effective operators or the quasispin propagating forward or backward in time , respectively .",

    "as in the usual photon setup , alice and bob can choose among two settings .    differently to commonly investigated systems one has more options .",
    "one can vary in the quasispin space or vary the detection times or both .    with our effective framework we can rewrite the bell - chsh - inequality in a witness type , i.e. with the bell operator @xmath225 any local realistic hidden parameter theory has to satisfy latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    form of the generalized bell - chsh inequality @xcite gives us the opportunity to find for a given choice of bell settings without optimization over all possible initial states whether the bell inequality can be violated . in particular , the eigenvalues of the bell operator give us the upper and lower bound that can be reached for the optimal initial state , i.e. the one which maximizes or minimizes the bell inequality . determining whether a bell inequality is preserved or violated for a given state @xmath32 is in general a high - dimensional nonlinear constrained optimization problem . in ref .",
    "@xcite a numerical method was shown by introducing a proper parameterization @xcite for unitary matrices to derive bounds on bell inequalities for any qudit system ( @xmath227level system ) .",
    "this certainly is a benefit of our introduced effective formalism as optimization in this case is not needed . in any numerical optimization",
    "there is no guarantee that the global extremum was reached . in some exemplary cases we checked for the agreement and in many case the optimization failed .",
    "we present first a generalized bell inequality which has been discussed in literature @xcite and shows a relation between @xmath0 violation and the nonlocality detected by the above bell inequality .",
    "then we proceed to a bell setting that can be realized in a direct experiment .",
    "let us choose all times equal zero and choose the quasispin states @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the @xmath78 plus eigenstate .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors showed that after optimization the chsh  bell inequality can be turned for an initial spin singlet state into @xmath230 where @xmath201 is the @xmath78 violating parameter in mixing , eq.([asymlept ] ) .",
    "experimentally , @xmath201 corresponds to the leptonic asymmetry of kaon decays which is measured to be @xmath231 .",
    "this value is in clear contradiction to the value required by the chsh - bell inequality above , i.e. by the premises of local realistic theories !",
    "the result can be also made stronger by changing the bell setting by @xmath232 , then one obtains @xmath233 , thus both chsh - bell inequalities require @xmath234 i.e. any local realistic hidden variable theory is in contradiction to @xmath235 violation , a difference of a world of particles and antiparticles . in this sense",
    "the violation of a symmetry in high energy physics is connected to the violation of a bell inequality , i.e. to nonlocality .",
    "this is clearly not available for photons , they do not violate the @xmath235 symmetry .    we also want to remark that the considered bell inequality , since it is chosen at time @xmath87 is connected to a test of contextuality rather than nonlocality . _ noncontextuality _ , the independence of the value of an observable on the experimental context due to its predetermination a main hypothesis in hidden variable theories is definitely ruled out !",
    "so the contextual quantum feature is demonstrated for entangled kaonic qubits .",
    "although the bell inequality  ( [ bicp ] ) is as loophole free as possible , the probabilities or expectation values involved are not directly measurable , because experimentally there is no way to distinguish the short  lived state @xmath25 from the @xmath78 plus state @xmath229 directly .",
    "let us now proceed to another choice for the bell inequality ( [ chsh ] ) , i.e. all quasispins equal @xmath63 , but we are going to vary all four times @xmath236 this has the advantage that it can in principle be tested in experiments .",
    "alice and bob insert at a certain distance from the source ( corresponding to the detection times ) a piece of matter forcing the incoming neutral kaon to react . because the strong interaction is strangeness conserving one knows from the reaction products if it is an antikaon or not .",
    "note that different to photons a @xmath237 event does not mean that the incoming kaon is a @xmath61 but also includes that it could have decayed before . in principle",
    "the strangeness content can also be obtained via decay modes , but alice and bob have no way to force their kaon to decay at a certain time , the decay mechanism is a spontaneous event . however ,",
    "a necessary condition to refute local realistic theories are _ active _ measurements , i.e. exerting the free will of the experimenter ( for more details consult @xcite ) .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors studied the problem for an initial maximally entangled bell state , i.e. , @xmath238 , and found that a value greater than @xmath210 can not be reached , i.e. one can not refute any local realistic theory .",
    "the reason is that the particle  antiparticle oscillation is too slow compared to the decay or vice versa , i.e. , the ratio of oscillation to decay @xmath239 is about @xmath240 for kaons and not @xmath210 necessary for a violation .",
    "a different view is that the decay property acts as a kind of `` decoherence '' as we introduced in section [ timeevolution ] . from decoherence studies",
    "we know that some states are more `` robust '' against a certain kind of decoherence than others , this leads to the question if another maximally entangled bell state or maybe a different initial state would lead to a violation which is indeed the case .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that such states exists .",
    "this shifts the problem to finding methods to produce these initial states leading to a violation of the generalized chsh  bell inequality .",
    "this is still an open problem . in ref .",
    "@xcite also the interplay between entanglement and entropy was studied and as also shown by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , who studied the dynamics of two qubits interacting with a common zero - temperature non - markovian reservoi , the picture that entanglement loss due to environmental decoherence is accompanied by loss of the purity of the state of the system does not apply to these systems .",
    "given our effective operator formalism we can answer the question how much nonlocality is there for the given bell setting if we vary the times . in fig .",
    "[ bifig ] we plotted the eigenvalues of the bell operator for different choices corresponding to the maximal / minmal value of the bell inequality as well as the uncertainty .",
    "we find only a small amount of violation ( about @xmath241 ) but huge time regions of possible violations .",
    "moreover , we notice an asymmetric behaviour of the minimal and maximal eigenvalues of the bell operator which is due to the two different decay constants , as also plotted in fig .",
    "[ bifig2 ] for a slow decaying system and for the b  meson system .    in ref .",
