    "on the one hand , it is now a very critical time for detecting _ directly _ gravitational waves . despite the negative detection results , some limits on the physical parameters of pulsar - like star s interiors can be obtained with theoretical calculations which relate the waves to star s nature in literatures , based on the experiment data of gravitational waves .",
    "andersson & kokkotas @xcite calculated the eigenfrequencies of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 modes , and found that the frequencies depend on star s mass and radius .",
    "numerical results @xcite showed that the information of neutron star structure could be carried by gravitational waves of the axial @xmath7-modes .",
    "the inverse problem for pulsating neutron stars , based on the studies of those modes , was discussed extensively by kokkotas , apostolatos & andersson @xcite .",
    "the frequencies and damping behaviors were reexamined for different equations of state @xcite , and recently , tsui & leung @xcite applied an inversion scheme to determine star s mass , radius , and density distribution via gravitational wave asteroseismology . from the theoretical work",
    "above , one sees then that a positive result of recording gravitational wave signal should improve significantly the knowledge of matter at supranuclear density .    on the other hand ,",
    "pulsar - like compact stars were discovered since 1968 , but , unfortunately , we are still not sure about their nature .",
    "it is conventionally believed that these compact stars are normal neutron stars .",
    "however one can _ not _ rule out the possibility , that they are actually quark stars composed of quark matter with de - confined quarks and gluons , either from the first principles or according to their various observations @xcite .",
    "quarks are fundamental fermions in the standard model of particle physics , and the existence of quark matter is a direct consequence of the asymptotically free nature of the strong interaction , which was proved in the regime of non - abelian gauge theories and confirmed by high - energy collider experiments . in this sense , to affirm or negate the existence of quark stars is of significantly fundamental meaning for understanding the nature s elementary strong interaction .",
    "quark stars with strangeness are popularly discussed in literatures , which are called as strange ( quark ) stars , whereas nonstrange quark stars would also be possible if nonstrange quark matter could also be stable at zero pressure due to color confinement @xcite .",
    "we do not differentiate between the terms of quark stars and strange stars here , supposing both kinds of the stars have a quark surface to confine quarks and gluons .",
    "therefore , one of the key points for today s astrophysicists is understanding the nature of pulsars : to find competitive evidence for quark stars or for normal neutron stars .",
    "effective methods to do depend on ( i ) the minimum spin periods , ( ii ) the mass - radius relations , and ( iii ) the surface differences @xcite .",
    "however , since they are relativistic , pulsar - like compact stars could be potentially gravitational wave radiators .",
    "the features and strength of this emission would reflect their nature , and one may probe into pulsar s interior with gravitational waves .",
    "recently , the laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) has monitored 28 radio pulsars @xcite , and obtained upper limits of gravitational radiative intensities for the pulsars .",
    "if pulsars are quark stars , how and what can one constraint the pulsar s nature based on the data ? we are trying to analyze relevant issues in this paper .",
    "there are actually two motivations to study gravitational waves using pulsars : ( i ) as a tool and ( ii ) as a source .",
    "these two result in different physics .",
    "the radio pulsar timing array depends on the `` clock '' nature , not on the internal structure of pulsars , while the direct detection of the waves from isolated and/or binary pulsars depends on the internal structure of pulsars .",
    "the former is not discussed in this paper .",
    "certainly , a successful detection of gravitational waves from pulsar - like stars is very important for understanding ( i ) the physics of matter at supranuclear density and ( ii ) the physics of gravity .",
    "a mass formula for strangelet analogous to the bethe - weizsacher semi - empirical mass function in nuclear physics was introduced by @xcite . neglecting the symmetry and coulomb energy terms , which are not important in the case of strange quark stars",
    ", one has @xmath8 , where the volume and surface energy contributions are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , with @xmath11 mev and @xmath12 the baryon number @xcite . by introducing baryon number density @xmath13 ( @xmath3 the radius of spherical quark matter ) and the surface energy per unit area @xmath14",
    ", we have @xmath15 and thus @xmath16 mev/@xmath17 .",
    "however , @xcite obtained a surface energy ( or surface tension ) , @xmath14 , which varies from about 10 to 140 mev @xmath18 , depending on stellar radius .",
    "it is worth noting that the surface energy , which will be neglected in this paper , due to an electrostatic field of @xmath19 v / cm on a star s surface is several orders smaller that 10 mev @xmath20 .",
    "we consider thus this poorly known parameter @xmath14 to range between @xmath21 mev @xmath18 and @xmath22 mev @xmath18 .      a hot turbulent bare quark star may eject ( or `` evaporate '' ) low - mass quark matter ( quark nuggets ) .",
    "phenomenologically , there could be 4 steps to create a quark nugget ( fig.[birth ] ) .",
    "two parameters , which are not know with certainty yet , describe the turbulent nature of protostrange stars : the convective scale @xmath23 and velocity @xmath24 .",
    "it is possible that @xmath25 cm , @xmath26 cm / s @xcite . in step ( a )",
    ", the typical kinematic energy of turbulent part is @xmath27 , while the surface and the gravitational energies , which may prevent the fluid part to eject , are @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( quark star s mass @xmath2 and its radius @xmath3 , lump s mass @xmath30 and radius @xmath31 ) , respectively .",
    "the height of a bulge increases if @xmath32 , as is shown in step ( b ) . the contact area between the star and the bump becomes smaller and smaller , as shown in step ( c ) , because of ( i ) a limited scale of kinematic flow with order , and ( ii ) a total momentum which tends to separate nugget from star .",
    "a quark nugget form finally , with a velocity of @xmath33 , step ( d ) .",
    "the density of a bare strange star with mass @xmath34 is nearly uniform @xcite , and the mass of such a star can be well approximated by , @xmath35 where the bag constant @xmath36 mev/@xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 g/@xmath39 . for simplicity , we apply this approximation throughout this paper",
    ".    what kind of quark nugget could be ejected ?",
    "let s compare the energies below , @xmath40 where @xmath41 g/@xmath39 is the average density of quark stars with mass @xmath42 , @xmath43 cm , @xmath44 mev/@xmath17 . both @xmath45 and @xmath46 should be much larger than 1 if quark nuggets are ejected .",
    "we conclude then from eq.([compare ] ) that : ( i ) it needs @xmath47 cm / s that nuggets with mass @xmath48 g can be ejected ; ( ii ) nuggets with higher mass could be ejected from nascent quark stars with lower mass ; ( iii ) ejection of nuggets with planet masses ( e.g. , the earth s mass @xmath49 g ) could be possible if @xmath50 cm / s ; ( iv ) a nascent quark star with weak turbulent ( e.g. , @xmath51 cm / s ) could hardly evaporate nuggets with low mass ( e.g. , @xmath52 g ) .",
    "hadrons may not evaporate from the surface of a quark star with temperature being much lower than 100 mev if @xmath14 is order of 100 mev/@xmath17 .",
    "the unknown parameter @xmath24 would be probably much larger than @xmath53",
    "cm / s since observations show that pulsar - like stars receive a large kick velocity ( of order a few hundred to a thousand km / s ) at birth .",
    "these ejecta could be captured by the center strange star ( with mass @xmath2 and radius @xmath3 ) for @xmath24 should be smaller than the escape velocity @xmath54 cm / s .",
    "we then conclude that _ quark planets _",
    "( i.e. , planets of quark matter , with possible mass from much lower than earth mass to about a jupiter mass ) would form simultaneously during the formation of a strange star with strong turbulence if the surface energy is reasonable ( @xmath55 mev @xmath20 ) .",
    "this consequence could be tested by searching quark planets around pulsars .",
    "this is also an alternative mechanism for creating pulsar - planet systems , the first one of which was discovered by @xcite .",
    "a spherical fluid should be deform by rotation .",
    "for a quark star of incompressible fluid with axis - symmetric deformation , the star s surface can be described as , @xmath56 , \\label{r}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath57 is determined by a constant volume of @xmath58 . in case of @xmath59 ( and thus terms with orders being higher than @xmath60",
    "are neglected ) , the quadrupole deformation ( @xmath61 ) , which will only be noted as following , is actually of an ellipsoidal figure with an ellipticity @xmath62 and axes @xmath63 .    in case of a rotating fluid star with @xmath64 , the ellipticity @xmath65 and the eccentricity @xmath66",
    "are related by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , as a function of the spin frequency @xmath69 , is the total moment of inertia , with @xmath70 for stars with uniform density .",
    "the total energy , @xmath71 , of a rotating fluid star is then the sum of gravitation , rotation , volume , and surface energies .",
    "a calculation similar to the nuclear liquid drop model @xcite shows @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the energy for a non - rotating spherical star , @xmath74 the star s angular momentum , @xmath75 the momentum of inertia , and the coefficients @xmath76 and @xmath77 measure the increases of gravitation and surface energies , respectively , of the star , @xmath78 the surface energy contribution to the deformation should be negligible since the parameter @xmath79 is much smaller than 1 unless the star is very low - massive ( i.e. , mass @xmath80 g for strangelets ) and/or @xmath81 mev/@xmath17 .    by using @xmath82 with eq.([e ] ) , neglecting @xmath77 , one comes to the rotating figures of conventional maclaurin spheroids can only be valid for @xmath83.],@xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the eccentricity and the ellipticity , respectively , of a fluid star at equilibrium , which are only a function of spin , provided that @xmath87 is a constant , the spin period @xmath88 ms .",
    "one can also have @xmath89 which means the equilibrium state of @xmath90 is stable .",
    "we expect that a fluid quark star , either at birth or in its lifetime , should _ oscillate _ globally around @xmath86 , though the oscillation frequency and amplitude are still not computed now .",
    "if the amplitude is large , this quadrupole oscillation could result in enough gravitational radiation to be detected by future advanced facilities .",
    "additionally , this oscillation modes may help us to distinguish fluid and solid quark star models .",
    "a protoquark star should be in a fluid state , but the star may solidified soon after its birth @xcite .",
    "therefore , we should find ways to differentiate solid and fluid quark stars in their later time .",
    "due to the strong shear force , a solid quark star may oscillate with much smaller amplitude but much higher frequency than that of a fluid quark star .",
    "besides detecting the gravitational wave , pulsar timing in radio , optical , as well as x - ray bands could be effective if the star has pulsed emission , because the rotation period changes during the oscillation .",
    "could the oscillation amplitude be larger enough to fragmentate a fluid quark star ? unlike the case of nuclear fission , where the coulomb interaction favors , the gravitational interaction prevent a quark star to fragmentate .",
    "it needs then energy to `` excite '' the star , with order of @xmath91 .",
    "if pulsar kick @xcite , with energy of @xmath92 , plays a major role to fission a quark star , we note that the kick velocity @xmath93 should be greater than @xmath94 cm / s",
    ". therefore , a quark star with large kick ( or turbulent ) energy and low mass could fragmentate .",
    "in newtonian theory , a rapidly rotating fluid maclaurin spheroid is secularly unstable to become a jacobi spheroid , which is non - axisymmetric , if the ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the absolute value of the gravitational potential energy @xmath95 . in the general relativistic case ,",
    "as was shown by @xcite and @xcite , gravitational radiation reaction amplifies an oscillation mode , and it is then found that the critical value of @xmath96 for the onset of the instability could be much smaller than 0.1375 for neutron stars with mass @xmath97 .",
    "this sort of non - axisymmetric stellar oscillations will inevitably result in gravitational wave radiation .",
    "a kind of oscillation mode , socalled @xmath31-mode , is focused on in the literatures since the work by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31-mode oscillation is also called as the rossby waves that are observed in the earth s ocean and atmosphere , the restoring force of which is the coriolis force .",
    "this instability may increase forever if no dissipation occurs . therefore , whether the instability can appear and how much the oscillation amplitude is depend on the interior structure of pulsars , which is a tremendously complicated issue in supranuclear physics .    to make sense of the generic nature for @xmath31-mode instability in different star - modes but avoiding an uncertainty in microphysics , we just present a rough calculation below .",
    "the critical angular frequency , @xmath69 , limited by the gravitational radiation due to @xmath31-mode instability , are determined by comparing the damping / growth times due to the various mechanisms for energy dissipation in a given star - model , @xmath98 where the timescales for the instability are estimated to be @xcite , @xmath99 where superscript `` ns '' ( `` ss '' ) denotes neutron ( bare strange ) star model , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the dissipation timescales due to shear and bulk viscosities , respectively , and @xmath102 the coupling constant of strong interaction , @xmath103 the temperature , @xmath104 the strange quark mass in 100 mev .",
    "it is assumed in eq.([taudiss ] ) that the modified urca process dominate the weak interaction in normal neutron stars .",
    "strange stars could have very low masses , even of @xmath105 ( a strange star with planet mass could also be called as a strange _ quark _ planet ) . a low - mass normal neutron star could not be likely because of ( i ) the minimum mass of a stable neutron star is @xmath106 @xcite , and ( ii ) the gravitation - released energy of possible low - mass neutron star during an iron - core collapse supernova , @xmath107 , should be much smaller than @xmath108 erg due to the relation @xmath109 for low - mass neutron stars , but it seems not successful in modern supernova simulations even in case of @xmath110 erg @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the following calculations , we consider low mass issues for bare strange stars , but apply only canonical mass of @xmath111 for normal neutron stars .",
    "no @xmath31-model instability occurs in a solid star since the coriolis - restoration force does not work here .",
    "the break frequency of low - mass bare strange stars could be approximately a constant , @xmath112 with a prefactor of @xmath113 at most for @xmath114 and @xmath115 cm @xcite , where the bag constant @xmath116 mev/@xmath37 .",
    "let s express the critical frequency in unit of @xmath117 , through calculations based on eq.([r - mode ] ) .",
    "it is found in fig.[rmode ] that : ( i ) gravitational wave radiates more likely from proto - neutron stars than from proto - strange stars ; ( ii ) the @xmath31-mode instability could not occur in fluid bare strange stars with radii being smaller than @xmath118 km ( or mass of a few @xmath119 ) unless these stars rotates faster than the break frequency ; and ( iii ) the above conclusions do not change significantly in the reasonable parameter - space of @xmath120 , @xmath102 , and @xmath121 . to estimate strength of gravitational waves from this oscillation , one needs to simulate the nonlinear increase of the instability , which is not certain yet .",
    "some recent observations in x - ray astronomy could hint the existence of low - mass bare strange stars @xcite .",
    "the radiation radii ( of , e.g. , 1e 1207.4 - 5209 and rx j1856.5 - 3754 ) are only a few kilometers .",
    "no gravitational wave emission could be detected from such fluid stars even they spin only with a period of @xmath122 ms .",
    "gravitational wave radiation from pulsars could be classified as ( i ) emission due to the normal modes of oscillation of fluid matter ( e.g. , the @xmath123mode instability discussed in  3 ) , and ( ii ) emission due to solid deforming which will be focused in this section .",
    "protoquark stars should be in a fluid state when their temperatures are order of 10 mev , but would be solidified as they cool to very low temperatures @xcite . assuming the ellipticity of a solid quark star , with an initial spin period @xmath124 , keeps the same as that of the star just in its fluid phase , we expect realistic ellipticity @xmath125 of the star in the solid state satisfies @xmath126 as the star spins down to a period of @xmath127 , due to the shear force that prevent the star to deform . for the earth which is spinning down , the mean density is 5.5 g/@xmath39 , the ellipticity observed @xmath128 , one has @xmath86(24 hours)@xmath129 from eq.([varepsilon0 ] ) . additionally , a free precession mode called the chandler wobble , which was formulated and expected by leonhard euler , with a period of 435 days suggests a good approximation of @xmath125 too .",
    "this means that the suggestion of eq.([epsilon ] ) is at least workable for the equilibrium figure of the earth .",
    "however , strain energy develops when a solid quark star spins down , which is proportional to @xmath130 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the first glitch of the quark star occurs when the strain energy reaches a critical value @xcite .",
    "subsequent glitches take place too as the stellar stress increases to critical points .",
    "we note that the star s ellipticity decreases after glitches due to ( i ) the release of strain energy and ( ii ) possible increase of mean density if stellar volume shrinks as the star cools .",
    "a star s ellipticity could be observed if the star s free precession mode is discovered due to the relation @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the precession period .",
    "evidence for free precession for psr b1828 - 11 was provided by @xcite : periodic timing variation and changes in pulse duration .",
    "the derived ellipticity is @xmath133 _ if _ the precession is really in a free mode .",
    "but , based on eq.([varepsilon0 ] ) , the ellipticity is @xmath134 , which is 2 orders larger than that expected .",
    "this conclusion conflicts with eq.([epsilon ] )",
    ". why is psr b1828 - 11 so `` round '' ?",
    "an answer proposed here is that this observed precession mode could actually be torqued by external force , rather than free .",
    "in fact , a disk - forced precession model for psr b1828 - 11 was provided by @xcite , but other source torques by , e.g. , magnetodipole radiation or planet(s ) , are also possible .",
    "the precession period could be very long ( and thus results in a much small ellipticity if assuming free precession ) if torques are not strong . due to the torque exerted by the moon and the sun",
    ", the spinning earth shows a forced precession period of 25,700 yr , being much larger than 435 d , the period of free precession . by the way , planet - torque induced precession modes could be effective to search planets around pulsars .",
    "nevertheless , a free precession mode could have been discovered in a bursting radio source , gcrt j1745 - 3009 , in the direction of the galactic center region @xcite .",
    "the ellipticity derived from @xmath135 is @xmath136 .",
    "based on eqs.([varepsilon0 ] ) and ( [ epsilon ] ) , the spin period should be @xmath137 s , which is very reasonable for normal pulsars .",
    "if the pulsar s ellipticity tracks almost @xmath138 due to glitches , @xmath139 , then its ellipticity @xmath140 and period @xmath141 s. statistically , a pulsar with @xmath142 s could be a radio nulling ( even extremely , with null fraction @xmath143 ) pulsar @xcite , which fits the model provided by @xcite",
    ".    a pulsar must be non - axisymmetric in order to radiate gravitationally .",
    "a wobbling pulsar , either freely or forcedly , may thus radiation gravitational waves .",
    "this wave results in a perturbed metric @xmath144 of space - time ( @xmath145 ) , which is order of @xmath146 being given by @xcite , @xmath147 where approximations @xmath148 and @xmath149 are applied for solid quark stars in the right equation , the pulsar s distance to earth is @xmath150 kpc , @xmath4 is the wobble angle .",
    "ligo is sensitive to hight frequency waves , which recently puts upper limits on @xmath146 for 28 known pulsars through the second ligo science run @xcite .",
    "the upper limits are order of @xmath151 , which means approximately an limit of @xmath152",
    ". this observation may not conflict with eqs.([varepsilon0 ] ) and ( [ epsilon ] ) if the pulsars radii are slightly smaller than 10 km .",
    "in fact , possible candidates for low - mass quark stars with small radii are proposed by @xcite .",
    "only three normal pulsars are listed in table 1 of @xcite : the crab ( b0531 + 21 ) , j1913 + 1011 , and b1951 + 32 , others are millisecond pulsars .",
    "it is conventionally suggested that millisecond pulsars are recycled , with a spinup history during binary accretion , and the ellipticity may not follow eq.([epsilon ] ) since @xmath153 for such stars during their spinup phases .",
    "nonetheless , since millisecond pulsars are now in a spindown phase , we may simply suggest @xmath154 , which is valid for the earth , and calculate the upper limits of pulsars radii and thus masses according to eqs.([varepsilon0 ] ) and ( [ h0 ] ) . note that eq.([epsilon ] ) is still effective if millisecond pulsars are born during an aic ( accretion - induced collapse of white dwarfs ) process @xcite .",

    "_ elliptic deformation v.s . bumpy distortion .",
    "_ the lack of symmetry about a pulsar s rotation axis could be the result of either elliptic deformation because of rotation , which is discussed in  2 and  4 . or bumpy distortion ( i.e. , localized mountains on stellar surface ) .",
    "strong magnetic field is suggested for producing the bumps , since the magnetic and rotating axes are generally not aligned .",
    "however for quark stars , this mechanisms may not work due to a relatively negligible magnetic force , @xmath167 , even for fields ( @xmath168 g ) as strong as @xmath169 g. glitches of solid quark stars could produce bumps , with a maximum ellipticity @xcite , @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the stellar break strain .",

( 3 ) . through the second ligo science run , we may find upper limits of masses and radii for millisecond pulsars , although one can not constrain on the masses and radii of normal neutron stars .",

    "we suggest the precession mode discovered in psr b1828 - 11 is not free , but could be forced by fossil disk or planets .",
    "the geometrical parameters of torqued precession might be obtained by precise timing of radio pulses .",
    "the bursting radio source , gcrt j1745 - 3009 , could be a freely precessing radio pulsar with spin period @xmath178 s , which could be tested by searching pulsed emission from the source .",
    "as the mass - radius relation for low - mass quark stars ( @xmath179 ) is in striking contrast to those of normal neutron stars with low masses ( @xmath180 ) , gravitational radiation from low - mass neutron stars and quark stars should be very different for processes of both fluid instability and stellar wobbling .",
