    "eighty years after its discovery @xcite the nature of dark matter ( dm ) remains to be mysterious . among various hypothetical particles ,",
    "the so - called weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) is the leading candidate @xcite .",
    "it is also widely believed that wimps could annihilate with each other and then generate ( or alternatively decay into ) stable particles , such as high energy @xmath4rays and pairs of electrons / positrons , protons / antiprotons , and neutrinos / antineutrinos @xcite .",
    "such particles propagate into the galaxy and then become part of the cosmic rays .",
    "the accurate measurements of cosmic rays hence in turn provides the people a valuable chance to study the dark matter particle indirectly .",
    "the indirect detection of dark matter particles with space - based cosmic ray detectors has been a quickly evolving field since 2008 @xcite .",
    "the most - extensively discussed signature is the high energy spectra of cosmic ray electrons and positrons ( equally , the positron to electron ratio data ) that are well in excess of the prediction of the conventional cosmic ray propagation model , i.e. , the so - called electron / positron excesses @xcite . before 2015 , due to the lack of evidence for an antiproton excess @xcite , the electron / positron excesses have been widely attributed to the leptonic dark matter annihilation / decay @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the astrophysical origins , such as the electron / positron pairs from pulsars @xcite or the secondary particles accelerated in the snrs @xcite , can also reasonably account for the data .",
    "for example , di mauro et al .",
    "@xcite has shown that the electron / positron data can be satisfactorily modeled through the sum of an average primary electron flux from distant sources and the fluxes from the local supernova remnants in the green catalog and the secondary electron and positron fluxes originate from interactions on the interstellar medium of primary cosmic rays .",
    "such facts suggest that in comparison to identifying dark matter signal it may be more reasonable to use the data to set limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section and decay lifetime in given dark matter scenarios . in the pamela era , in view of the lack of distinct spectral structures that are predicted to arise in dark matter annihilations",
    "/ decays into electrons / positrons in the data , some researchers constrained the physical parameters of these exotic particles by assuming that the positron fraction excess arises from a group of pulsars @xcite . with the first ams-02 result ( i.e. , the positron fraction up to @xmath5 gev @xcite ) , an improved approach yielded stringent limits on dark matter annihilating or decaying to leptonic final states @xcite .",
    "later , the positron flux data or alternatively the electron flux data has been adopted to set limits on the dark matter annihilation / decay channels @xcite . recently , the ams-02 antiproton - to - proton ratio data has been announced in a dedicated conference @xcite and the high energy part seems to be in excess of the regular prediction of conventional cosmic ray propagation model ( while in ref.@xcite they argue that the background ( bkg ) is enough to explain ams-02 antiproton data if uncertainty in propagation model , solar modulation and nucleon collision process are taken into account ) . in this work",
    "we take both the antiproton ratio data and the positron fraction data to place the limits on the physical parameters of dark matter particles .",
    "the pulsar model may account for the positron fraction excess but likely not for the antiproton data . in this work",
    "we consider the scenario of secondary particles accelerated in snrs @xcite which may explain both the ams-02 positron fraction and antiproton ratio data . following the phenomenological ams parametrization approach we parameterize the contribution of the snr with a simple function and calculate the background ( bkg ) ratio of positron and antiproton with galprop@xcite",
    ", then we add the snr component to the bkg component as the total ratio at top of the atmosphere ( toa ) . using this result we place limits on the dm parameters .",
    "we find that our limits are stronger than the limits given by ackermann et al .",
    "@xcite which derived from the fermi - lat gamma - ray pass 8 data on the dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies . further more , we use this results to put constrains the effective field theory which are mostly discussed at direct detection and large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "this work is arranged as the following . in section",
    "ii we briefly introduce the model of secondary particle acceleration in snr , some details of bkg cr propagation model . in section",
    "iii we present our limits on the dark matter parameters and study the uncertainties caused by the propagation parameters , solar modulation parameters , and the dark matter distribution profile models . and in section",
    "iv we put limits on the effective field theory by using the results we obtain in section iii .",
    "we summarize our results in section v.",
    "in this work , we consider the acceleration of secondary crs in the snr diffusive shock .",
    "the evolution of the gyro - phase and pitch - angle averaged phase space density @xmath6 of species @xmath7 is governed by the transport equation @xcite    @xmath8    and the the solution of this equation is found to be    @xmath9    where @xmath10 represent upstream and @xmath11 represent downstream , the slope @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the velocity of fluid , @xmath14 is the compression factor . for a strong shock @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the factor @xmath17 represents the mean fraction of the energy of an accelerated proton carried away by a secondary particle in each scattering .",
    "@xmath18 is the diffusion coefficient of the shock @xcite .",
    "the production rate at a position @xmath19 around the shock is    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the speed of light , @xmath22 is the cross section for a primary specie @xmath23 of energy @xmath24 to produce a secondary particle _",
    "i _ of energy @xmath25 . the source spectrum @xmath26 and @xmath27 then @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the gas density in the shock region .",
    "then one can find that @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the slope of the diffusion coefficient ( in the following @xmath32 is taken as 1 for a bohm - like diffusion coefficient ) , this result indicates that he equilibrium spectrum of the particles that take part in the acceleration is flatter than the injection spectrum of secondary particles @xcite . as presented in @xcite the secondary - to - primary ratio ( such as @xmath33 ) which contributed from accelerating in the snr",
    "can be easily derived with above results    @xmath34,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 one can easily find that @xmath37 term is nearly a small constant and has been neglected in this work , and @xmath38 where @xmath39 represent a factor of nucleon collision which means that the slope of @xmath40 term dose not depend on the accelerated process but only decided by the nucleon collision . for the case of antiproton @xmath41 in @xcite indicated that @xmath42 and @xmath43 when 40@xmath0 uncertainty in nucleon collision process is taken into account .",
    "we note here that the eq.4 is also suitable for the case of positron fraction , the reason is that since positrons and electrons suffered nearly the same energy loss after releasing into the interstellar space , so the energy losses of positrons and electrons are cancelled out each other in the positron fraction .",
    "this conclusion may be seen from the bkg component of positron fraction in the right panel of fig.1 .",
    "spallation and decay are taken into account in @xcite ( add a term @xmath44 on the right of eq.1 ) which lead to a suppression of the secondary contribution at very high energies . in this work",
    "we take a form of @xmath45 as the contribution of secondary particles accelerated in snr , then the observed ratio of secondary - to - primary is @xmath46 .",
    "primary crs are released into the interstellar space after accelerated in snr sources and the secondaries crs are produced by the interaction of primary with the ism , the propagation of crs in the galaxy was described by the transport equation @xcite    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the cr density per unit of total particle momentum @xmath49 at position @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the spatial diffusion coefficient that can be parameterized as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the particle rigidity , we use the default setting of the propagation parameters in the galprop @xmath55 @xmath56 , @xmath57 @xmath58 and @xmath59 , such values can fit the observational @xmath60 , @xmath61 well .",
    "however , there exist degeneracies of different set of propagation parameters which can not be distinguished with present experiments , so we also consider the effect of the propagation parameters on the exclusion line in the following .",
    "@xmath62 is diffusion coefficient in the momentum space and is related to @xmath51 by    @xmath63    where @xmath64 characterizes the level of turbulence and is taken as @xmath65 , @xmath66 is alfv@xmath67n speed which is set at 33.5 @xmath68 in the dr scheme .",
    "@xmath69 is the convection velocity that is assumed to increase linearly with distance from the plane @xcite , @xmath70 represents adiabatic momentum gain or loss in the non - uniform flow of gas with a frozen - in magnetic field whose inhomogeneities scatter the crs @xcite , and @xmath71 is the momentum gain or loss rate , @xmath72 is the characteristic time scale for radioactive decay and @xmath73 is the characteristic time scales for loss by fragmentation .",
    "@xmath74 is the source term including primary , spallation and decay contributions .",
    "the distribution of cr sources is taken as ,    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is a normalization constant , @xmath77 = 8.5",
    "kpc is the solar position in the galaxy , @xmath78 kpc , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the galaxy radius and a cut - off had been used in the source distribution at @xmath82 kpc since it is unlikely that significant sources are present at such large radii , @xmath83 is the column height of the galaxy and its maximum value is set to be @xmath84 = 4 kpc .",
    "the diffusion re - acceleration ( dr ) propagation model has been adopted in this work .",
    "we point out that the same as the snr component the bkg component can also be got by using phenomenological ams parametrization approach @xcite , or on the other hand the propagation of the snr component ( secondary particle accelerated in snr as a source ) can also be calculated using glprop ( and a nice fit results of positron fraction and antproton ratio can be found in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the former is a fully parametrization method while the latter is a fully physical method , the limits do not change significantly between this two methdos @xcite , because the ratio ( or flux ) at toa is the same for the two methods .",
    "the aim of our method present in this work is to get the right ratio or fraction at toa , while providing the physical processes in some details at the same time .",
    "we also note that there are also some other astrophysical models @xcite which may account for the ams-02 data well , but we do not discuss them in details here .",
    "we consider dm annihilations or decays in the following channels , @xmath85 @xmath86 each with 100@xmath0 branching ratio . the annihilations or decays of dark matter particles in the milky way dark matter halo at the position @xmath50 with respect to the galactic center",
    "produce a primary flux with a rate ( per unit energy and unit volume ) that is given by @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the dm mass , @xmath89 is the dm particle lifetime , @xmath90 is the dm velocity - weighted annihilation cross section , @xmath91 is the energy spectrum of sm particles produced in the annihilation or decay of dm particles which we simulate using the event generator pythia package @xcite , and @xmath92 is the density of dark matter particles in the milky way halo .",
    "we note that the predictions of cosmic - ray fluxes originated from dm annihilations or decays crucially depends on the distribution of dm in the galactic halo , however this astrophysical uncertainty is irreducible presently . in this work",
    "the profile is adopted to be the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) distribution @xcite , the einasto and isothermal distribution are also in consideration as a comparision .",
    "@xmath93 where @xmath94 kpc and @xmath95 gev @xmath96 .",
    "such a value of @xmath97 corresponds to a local dm energy density of 0.3 gev @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "we note that currently the more likely value is 0.43 gev  @xmath98 .",
    "such a correction of course is minor but the limits would be tighter by a factor of 2 ( annihilation model ) or 1.4 ( decay model ) .",
    "the statistical method of likelihood ratio test developed in @xcite is adopted to put limits on a possible dm contribution to the data measured by ams-02 .",
    "the likelihood function @xmath99 is taken the form as , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the parameters of the model , and the @xmath102 function is @xmath103 where _ m _ is the number of data , @xmath104 is the measured value and @xmath105 is the theory value for a certain model and the @xmath106 is the known deviation of the measurement .",
    "the fit results of @xmath107 for antiproton and positron are @xmath108 and @xmath109 which means a quite well fit results ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "upper limits at the @xmath110 @xmath111 on the dm annihilation or decay rate are derived by increasing the signal normalization from its best - fit value of astrophysic source model we discussed above until @xmath112 changes by 2.71 i.e. @xmath113 following this procedure , the positron fraction is used to calculate the constraints on the annihilation cross section and lifetime for the final states @xmath114 and @xmath115 while antiproton ratio is used to calculate the constraints on the annihilation cross section and lifetime for the final states @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , the results are presented in fig.2 .",
    "we also compaire our results with the limits given by ackermann et al .",
    "@xcite which derived from the fermi - lat gamma - ray pass 8 data on the dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies in the left panel of fig.3 , we find that our limits are stronger than theirs both for the @xmath115 and @xmath116 final states .",
    "in the right panel of fig.3 we study the the effect of the solar modulation on our results .",
    "after the galactic crs entering into the solar system due to the diffusion , these particles are suffered to convection , particle drift and adiabatic energy loss in the interplanetary magnetic field carried out by the solar wind .",
    "such an effect is the so - called solar modulation which depends , via drifts in the large scale gradients of the solar magnetic field ( smf ) , on the particle charge including its sign . as a result ,",
    "the solar modulation depends on the polarity of the smf , which changes periodically every @xmath119 years @xcite .",
    "recently the stochastic method is used to solve the four - dimensional parker ( 1965 ) transport equation which describes the transport of charged particles in the solar system , such progresses are remarkable , however there are still some uncertainties in this theory and the code is time - consuming .",
    "so in this work we only use the force field approximation since it work well above about 0.5 gev @xcite .",
    "we consider the solar modulation uncertainty @xmath120 mv around the best - fit value @xmath121 mv , as showed in the right panel of fig.3 , the uncertainty has a utmost value about 16@xmath0 at 10 gev , then decline to zero at @xmath122 gev .",
    "in fig.4 we study the the effect of the propagation parameters of @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 on our results ( just the @xmath116 final state is considered because for the final states of @xmath114 and @xmath115 the results are found to be insensitive of the propagation parameters @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , each time we change one parameter and fix the others to be fiducial values mentioned above .",
    "we find that the exclusion line alter slightly with the column height of the galaxy @xmath123 , so it may only contribute about 2@xmath0 uncertainty of our results if the uncertainty @xmath126 kpc is taken into account .",
    "the situation changed significantly for the diffusion parameters @xmath124 and @xmath125 since the diffusion process dominates the propagation of antiprotons in the galaxy .",
    "for example , with an uncertainty @xmath127 @xmath128 in @xmath124 , our limits changes @xmath129 for @xmath130 gev but @xmath131 for @xmath132 gev then declining to @xmath133 10@xmath0 above 1000 gev . in the case of @xmath125",
    "if one consider the uncertainty @xmath134 in @xmath125 then it contributes about 4@xmath0 uncertainty for @xmath1 gev , while above 100 gev the uncertainty raise to about 14@xmath0 . in the right bottom panel of fig.4",
    "we study the the effect of dm distribution profile on the limits , we can find that it contribute about 20@xmath0 uncertainty in the whole dm mass range if we consider the nfw profile as the standard dm distribution profile .",
    "so the propagation parameters contribute most uncertainty at large dm mass ( above @xmath135 gev ) while the most uncertainty at low dm mass is contributed from solar modulation , since the diffusion dominants the propagation of crs at high energy while the solar modulation effect the crs mostly at lower energy . as a result ,",
    "the uncertainty of the limits on the dm parameters is about @xmath136 in the whole dm mass range if we take into account the contributions of propagation parameters and solar modulation , this value raises to @xmath137 if the contributions of dm distribution profile has been taken into account .",
    "the other forms of uncertainty may contribute from the energy spectrum @xmath138 , it may be different if @xmath138 is generated from the pppc 4 dm i d package @xcite . the degeneracy between diffusion re - acceleration ( dr ) and diffusion convection ( dc ) propagation model may also contribute uncertainty to the limits results , but this maybe tiny ,",
    "specifically , for the final state @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 the diffusion dominants the propagation of antiproton , and for the final states @xmath114 and @xmath115 the difference of limit results between dr and dc maybe little especially at @xmath139 gev @xcite .",
    "in the following , we use our results to put limits on the parameters of effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "we assume the dm as a dirac fermion ( we note that in the above results we have assumed a self - conjugate dm particle , the limits will improve by a factor 2 for the dirac fermion case ) .",
    "we also assume that the wimps is a singlet under the sm gauge groups , thus possesses no couplings to the electroweak gauge bosons at tree - level @xcite .",
    "the wimps may interact with the sm particles through a dark gauge sector , this symmetry is spontaneous breaking at low energy and leading to a supression of the interacton between wimps and sm particles .",
    "the eft can approximatively describe such interaction by using higher - dimensional operators , and this method is model independent .",
    "but we should borne in mind that this method will be broken down when the typical reaction energy is much higher than the mediator mass . in this work we study the following eft operators @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a sm fermion and @xmath142 is the mass , @xmath143 , @xmath144 is the mass of the exchanged particle , @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the couplings",
    ". then the annihilation cross section of the operators is given by @xcite @xmath147 where @xmath148 is wimps relative velocity in unit c. specificly , in the early universe @xmath149 , while today @xmath150 ( in the following , we use warm dm represents for the former case and cold dm for the latter case ) .",
    "we calculate the limits on @xmath151 for final state of b and u quarks , @xmath152 and @xmath89 leptons , and for each final state we consider the case of warm dm and cold dm respectively .",
    "the corresponding results are showed in fig.6 .",
    "we can find that the limits of @xmath153 operator and @xmath154 operator are not sensitive to the relative velocity @xmath148 .",
    "as showed in right panel of fig.2 , the bound of dm lifetime is @xmath155 , this indicates that the dm is stable .",
    "we can speculate that the decay of wimps are suppress by a very large mass scale such as planck scale @xmath156 . as pointed out in @xcite the global symmetries",
    "are generically violated at the planck scale , to describe dm decay they proposed some dimension - five effective operators which violate global symmetries . by requiring the couplings @xmath157 , they rule out a rather large dm mass range , including the classic wimp mass range around the electroweak scale .",
    "we also use our results to put limits on the coupling of the operators @xmath158 and @xmath159 ( see left panel of fig.6 ) , our results are similar to @xcite .    a main characteristic of the decay operators proposed in @xcite is the decay final states of a dm only contain sm particles , in the following we consider a dm may decay to another dm and sm particles at the same time , but without taking into account the global symmetries . we consider a @xmath160 effective interaction @xmath161 where @xmath162 represents a sm particle .",
    "it decribes the decay process @xmath163 , in the following we assume that the sm particles are massless because of the dm particles masses are always much larger than the sm particles .",
    "then the decay width of eq.16 is given by @xmath164,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath165 , @xmath166 is the mass of dm @xmath167 and @xmath168 is the mass of dm @xmath169 .",
    "we also assume that the coupling @xmath157 . to ensure the possibility of the decay process @xmath163 we require that the dm particle @xmath170 should light than the dm particle @xmath167 i.e. @xmath171 .",
    "then to have a solution for eq.17 , we should also require @xmath172 this condition is presented in the right panel of fig.6 ( solid red line ) . in the right panel of fig.6",
    "we also give the limits from ams-02 and icecube @xcite , we can see that the decay width @xmath173 has been excluded .",
    "we also calculate the decay width @xmath174 for @xmath175 and @xmath176 , ressult see the dot red line and solid blue line in right panel of fig.6 .",
