    "a similar result was found in the case of the seyfert ngc1068 where @xcite noted that deep vlba observations could detect a flux density almost 50% higher than that of lower sensitivity vlba observations by @xcite , but still the total flux density measured on images with lower spatial resolution could not be recovered .",
    "+      the fact that in seyfert nuclei the pc - scale radio emission does not account for all the flux density measured at lower resolution , even in the presence of an unresolved component , was already noted by @xcite by studying a sample of 22 nearby seyferts with the pti .",
    "they suggested that in seyfert galaxies the radio emission is more diffuse and less centrally concentrated than in elliptical radio galaxies .",
    "a similar behaviour was also found by @xcite by comparing simultaneous vla and vlbi observations of a sample of seyfert galaxies .",
    "they found that in @xmath1 60% of the sources more than half of the vla flux density of the unresolved component is missing in vlbi images .",

    "for example , it has been found that in flat - spectrum seyfert nuclei essentially all the emission on arcsecond scale is present on vlbi scales @xcite , indicating that all the radio emission is concentrated in the central component . on the other hand , in seyfert nuclei characterised by a steep spectrum ,",
    "the flux density recovered on mas - scales is usually significantly lower than that expected from arcsecond - scale images , suggesting that the radio emission is not centrally concentrated , but it is diffuse on a larger region .",
    "a noticeable example of a steep - spectrum seyfert nucleus where the flux density almost disappears moving from arcsec to milli - arcsec scales is represented by ngc4151 , where only 8% of the flux density from the central component could be recovered by vlbi observations @xcite , while a large fraction of the jet emission is undetected .",
    "this suggests that in seyfert nuclei unresolved on arcsec scale but with different spectral index properties , the dominant radio emission may originate from different features : from the central core in flat - spectrum objects , from extended features , like jets , in steep - spectrum nuclei .",
    "+      so far , the nature of the missing flux density has not been investigated in detail .",
    "this diffuse emission may be due to either thermal emission from ionised gas heated by the agn , or by nuclear star forming regions , or non - thermal radiation from the agn itself .",

    "we assume the gas temperature @xmath70 k. the missing flux is calculated as the difference between the vla and vlbi flux densities . in the case of mrk1239 and ngc3783 , the missing flux at 1.6 ghz is @xmath1 50 and 18 mjy , respectively . if we consider these parameters in eq .",
    "[ free ] , we obtain an upper limit to the electron density @xmath71 , over a spherical volume of 0.1 arcsec ( i.e. 57 and 20 pc for mrk1239 and ngc3783 respectively ) in diameter .",
    "this value is the largest angular size detectable from the vlba , ( i.e. the vlba at 1.6 ghz is insensitive to structures larger than 0@xmath17.1 ) and it represents , therefore , a lower limit to the source size .",
    "such a dense gas would completely absorb the synchrotron emission arising from the embedded agn :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the observed and the intrinsic flux density at the frequency @xmath41 respectively , @xmath75 is the width of the ionised region , and @xmath76 the absorption coefficient at the frequency @xmath41 @xcite . at radio wavelengths",
    "@xmath77    we consider that the pc - scale structure found in the vlba images ( figs .",
    "[ m1239]c and [ n3783 ] ) arises from the central agn and the observed flux density is 10 mjy and 5 mjy for mrk1239 and ngc3783 respectively .",
    "we assume that the agn is located in the centre of the ionised region , i.e. @xmath75 is equal to the radius of the ionised sphere ( fig .",
    "[ sfera ] ) that accounts for 28.5 pc and 10 pc in the case of mrk1239 and ngc3783 , respectively . with this parameters in eq .",
    "[ absorption ] we obtain an intrinsic flux density arising from the central agn that is much higher than a few thousands of jy .",
    "this suggests that the `` missing '' flux is not free - free from gas ionised by the central agn , and a non - thermal agn - related origin is more plausible .",
    "+ another possibility may be that the ionised gas is related to an h@xmath78 region located in projection behind the agn , or that the gas around the agn is not ionised uniformly .",
    "in this way , our line of sight to the central agn does not pass through the ionised gas , thus avoiding any absorption of the agn radiation .",
    "+ however , a strong support to the non - thermal synchrotron origin of the diffuse emission comes from the comparison , when possible , between the spectral index distribution in low and spatial resolution images .",
    "for example , in the case of ngc5506 , the unresolved nucleus in vla data has a steep spectrum with a mean value @xmath79 , while at pc - scale resolution @xcite the spectrum has a convex shape with the peak occurring around 3.5 ghz .",
    "this suggests that a significant fraction of steep - spectrum , low - surface brightness emission is present in the nuclear region , but it can not be detected in vlbi observations likely due to observational limitations . + as in the case of ngc4151 @xcite , the steep emission may arise from a jet , that may be distorted and/or disrupted by the dense ambient medium .",
    "for example on arcsecond scale , ngc4151 displays a compact core and two collimated jets @xcite .",
    "when observed with higher resolution , the compact core is resolved in several knots forming a jet which is not aligned with the arcsec - scale jet @xcite . the misalignment often found between the radio jets on milli - arcsecond scale and those on larger scale @xcite may be an evidence of the interaction between the radio jet and the environment . in this scenario",
    "it is also possible that , for some reason , flat - spectrum seyfert nuclei are not able to develop a radio jet , and this causing that all their emission is produced in the central compact component .",
    "we presented the analysis of multi - frequency archival vla and vlba data of 7 close and bright seyfert nuclei .",
    "the conclusions we can draw from this investigation are : +    * at vla resolution , fwhm @xmath80 , the nucleus of the seyfert galaxies is unresolved , with the only exception of mgc-5 - 23 - 16 and ngc7469 which show a core - jet structure . at vlba resolution ,",
    "equivalent to a few parsecs , the nucleus of mrk1239 is resolved in two components , while in ngc3783 it is still unresolved . + * the seyfert galaxies in this study with known circumnuclear star - forming regions in the ir , namely ngc1097 , ngc7469 and ngc7582 @xcite present a radio counterpart for a few ( @xmath110% ) of these regions .",
    "most are not detected in radio , indicating that those detected may be characterised by higher supernovae rate .",
    "their steep radio spectral index is in line with this idea .",
    "conversely , none of the other seyfert nuclei present any circumnuclear radio emission .",
    "the only exception is ngc5506 that shows a radio halo surrounding the nucleus . + * a comparison between arcsecond and milli - arsecond resolution in mrk1239 and ngc3783 , pointed out that almost 80% of the radio flux density detected in vla observations is not recovered at pc - scale resolution .",
    "this suggests the presence of a diffuse component on scales of a few tens of parsecs , undetected with the vlba .",
    "similar situation is found in ngc1068 , ngc4151 , ngc5506 and ngc7469 .",
    "the nature of this `` missing '' flux components is likely due to synchrotron agn - related emission .",
    "this difference between the flux density measured on arcsecond and milli - arcsecond resolution images is not found in the case of elliptical radio galaxies , but it appears to be a common phenomenon in seyfert galaxies with a steep spectrum , mostly hosted in spirals .",
    "if of synchrotron origin , this emission may be spilt off from a jet that may get easily distorted and/or disrupted by the dense interstellar medium in the nucleus of spirals .",
    "+ * a comparison between seyfert nuclei with different spectral properties points out that in flat - spectrum nuclei , almost all the flux density is recovered on milli - arcsecond scale .",
    "this indicates that in flat - spectrum objects the radio emission is essentially concentrated in the compact core , without evidence of jet - like structure even on milli - arcsecond scale , while in steep - spectrum objects a significant fraction of the radio emission arises from low - surface brightness , extended features .",
