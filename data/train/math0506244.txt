    "inside the exceptional boxes the s @xmath87 ( for each fixed @xmath140 ) continue to accumulate to roughly at most 5 curves where three of the curves are the extensions of the curves carrying the @xmath121 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 ( defined by replacing @xmath141 by a continuous real parameter ) and one of the new curves , which exists under certain conditions , can be related to barrier top s in dimension 1 .",

    "the appearance of @xmath142-shaped distributions for non- s in one dimension seems to be quite well known and we refer to shkalikov @xcite , redparth @xcite and further references given there , as well as to the recent works by l. nedelec @xcite and e. servat and a. tovbis  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath142shaped eigenvalue distribution is also readily observed numerically  see figure 1 on this page , and also figure 2 and figure 3 on pages 8 and 9 , respectively .",
    "unfortunately it turned out to be exceedingly difficult to give a concise and precise description of what happens inside the exceptional boxes in the form of a theorem in less than several pages , so instead we refer the reader to the sections [ sectionsk][sectionev ] where this description can be found .",

    "we make a remark that permits to improve the domain of validity in the direction of small s. this gives an improvement also in the applications to barrier tops in @xcite and allows us in the present work to treat s @xmath145 with @xmath146 for every fixed @xmath147 , while a direct application of theorem [ thint.1 ] would only give the range @xmath148 .",
    "( in this special situation one can say that the lower bound @xmath149 , can be replaced by @xmath150 for every fixed @xmath27 . )",
    "when starting this project , we underestimated the amount of ingredients needed , and in order to keep the work within a reasonable size , we decided to exclude from the paper the very interesting case when there are more than one saddle point on the same connected component of @xmath151 at real energy 0 .",
    "the most important case here is probably the one with 2 saddle points arising because of an anti - symplectic involution ( typically @xmath152 in the schrdinger case ) . we hope to take up at least the 2 saddle point case in a future work ( having settled essentially all heavy technicalities in the present work ) .",
    "we might then also include the interesting case when breaks down at isolated points , leading to orbifolds .",
    "see colin de verdire  v ngc @xcite in the case .",
    "we also ran into a somewhat unexpected difficulty .",
    "indeed , for the one - dimensional s @xmath153 , we have a pseudospectral phenomenon leading to an exponential growth of the resolvent norm in important regions near the spectrum of these s. this makes it very important to keep the errors in the reduction to the @xmath85 in exponentially small , so that the accumulated error in the global resolvent constructions remains controlled . in @xcite we avoided that problem by working in naturally adapted norms where the pseudospectral problems disappeared , but that does not seem equally easy to do here .",
    "this refined reduction is carried out in section [ sectionexp ] using quasi - norms from the theory of analytic s originally due to boutet de monvel  kre @xcite , in the simplified variant of @xcite .",
    "the price to pay is the apparent necessity to impose the condition and the upper bound @xmath154 , that should be compared to the bound @xmath155 for every fixed @xmath147 in @xcite or even @xmath156 in @xcite .",

    "an application of proposition 12.1 shows that all the @xmath1325 in ( [ para.1 ] ) are constant .",
    "moreover , since in this case all the s depend linearly on @xmath0 , we see from the proof that the @xmath1325 have to vanish .",
