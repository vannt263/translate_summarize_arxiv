    "in recent decades , the evolution of nuclear shapes along isotopic and isotonic chains in neutron - rich nuclei at @xmath0 has attracted many attentions . the sudden onset of quadrupole deformation in neutron - rich sr and zr isotopes at the neutron number @xmath1 is of particular interest .",

    "however , the measured charge radii was shown to be increasing moderately with the neutron number at @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "essential to the understanding of this dramatic shape evolution is the coexistence of different shapes in the two lowest @xmath10 states .",
