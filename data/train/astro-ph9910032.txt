    "first shell - galaxies tend to have both strong mg2 and fe indices at the same time , whereas pair - galaxies have a broader distribution both in mg2 and fe indices .",
    "furthermore , in our sample , while the _ weak lined _ galaxies ( i.e. low values of metal indices ) , pair - members only , are almost consistent with the theoretical prediction , _ strong lined _ galaxies fall below it .",
    "in fact , it has long been known that ( e.g. worthey et al .",
    "1994 ) the relation between fe indices and mg2 tends to be flatter than that traced by the evolutionary path of ssps .",
    "this fact has been interpreted as evidence of enhancement in @xmath2 elements with respect to the solar partition ( perhaps caused by type ii super - novae contamination ) .",
    "we will come back later to this topic .",
    "the peculiar @xmath1 vs. mg2 diagram of shell - galaxies conforms to what is found for field galaxies with the fine structure index @xmath23 of schweizer ( 1992 ) larger than 2 ( bender et al . 1993 ) .",
    "however in our sample the effect is more significant .    among the galaxies showing fine structures ,",
    "shells are believed to be a signature of past strong dynamical interaction ( barnes 1996 ) .",
    "if this mechanism is responsible of the above displacement , several explanations are possible : ( i ) the major effect of dynamical interaction is on the velocity dispersion and other structural quantities rather than on the photometric properties of shell - galaxies ; in such a case the object moves vertically away from the universal @xmath1 vs. mg2 relation and maintains its position in the index - index planes .",
    "( ii ) as suggested by dynamical models of strong unbound encounters , the central velocity dispersion of the interacting objects remains unchanged and the main effect is a burst of star formation altering only the spectro - photometric properties , i.e. displacing them toward _ bluer , younger _ values of mg2 .",
    "most likely a combination of the two effects is at work .    though far from being",
    "statistically complete , we argue that our sample could sketch two consecutive phases of the accretion process : interaction and merging .",
    "we note that our selection criteria are biased toward pair - objects obeying the universal @xmath1 vs. mg2 relation .      assuming that fe5270 and mg2 are good indicators of the iron and magnesium abundances @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , g93 and worthey et al .",

    "giant galaxies are characterized by a high [ mg / fe ] ratio , whereas ordinary galaxies by a lower , nearly solar ratio .",

    "( 1992 ) to explain the observed fe vs. mg2 relation and the inferred over - abundance of mg passing from ordinary to giant ( bright ) early - type galaxies ( see also matteucci 1997 for a recent review of the subject ) .",
    "all of these interpretations stand on the notion that heavy elements ( like fe ) are predominantly generated by type i super - novae , whereas lighter elements ( like o , mg , si ) are produced by type ii super - novae .",
    "as type i and ii sne have progenitors with very different stellar masses ( intermediate , low - mass stars the former , and massive stars the latter ) , the production of o , mg , si occurs much earlier than the bulk production of fe .",
    "the goal is reached by supposing that star formation stops much earlier in giant galaxies than in compact ones .",
    "g93 s suggestion is somehow supported by the simple interpretation of the distribution of early - type galaxies in his sample on the h@xmath0 vs. [ mgfe ] plane ( see below ) . furthermore , considering the velocity dispersion @xmath1 as a measure of the galaxy mass , he argued that massive galaxies appear to be older than the low mass ones .",
    "incidentally , this opposes the standard galactic wind scenario proposed long ago by larson ( 1974 ) to explain the color - magnitude relation of early - type galaxies .",
    "it is worth noting that short - lived star formation in giant ( massive ) galaxies with respect to that in the compact ( less massive ) ones is not fully supported by major current theories of galaxy formation .",
    "in fact , in the gravitational collapse scenario , star formation in giant elliptical galaxies is expected to last longer than in the compact galaxies , because in the former the dynamical time scale is larger ( about 3 times ) than in the latter .",
    "conversely , in the hierarchical scenario , where big galaxies are the result of several mergers , global star formation is expected to last for long periods of time . in any case , both scenarios predict giant galaxies to be _ younger _ than compact galaxies .    to cast light on this intriguing affair , borges et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have recently provided a new empirical calibration of the mg2 index , that takes explicitly into account the relative abundance of the mg element .",

    "younger galaxies seem to be moderately more metal rich and less [ @xmath2/fe ] enhanced than the older ones ( see figures 5 and 6 in tantalo et al .",
    "the present study adopts the `` standard '' fitting functions , based on solar abundance ratios , and thus it can not follow their detailed abundance analysis .",
    "nevertheless , their results will appear to be strengthened when a larger sample of galaxies is analyzed in the [ mgfe ] vs. h@xmath0 diagram ( see next section ) .      according to worthey ( 1992 ) and bressan et al .",

    "recent experiments with composite stellar populations suggest that h@xmath0 yields a sort of _ mean age _ of the stellar populations , as it tends to over - weight the age of the young stellar component with respect to the age of the bulk stars ( see e.g. bressan et al .",

    "1996 ) .",
    "in our sample there are a number of galaxies with high @xmath1 and h@xmath0 values at the same time .",
    "this is particularly true for the sample of shell - galaxies .",
    "this finding implies the existence of a family of galaxies with deep gravitational potentials and relatively young ages .",
    "this can be a consequence of the interaction experienced by these galaxies that increases both @xmath1 and h@xmath0 ( thus making them appear younger ) .",
    "rampazzo et al .",
    "( 1999a ) have shown that shell - galaxies seem actually to belong to the family of giant galaxies , as far as their effective radius and surface brightness are concerned ( see fig.2 in rampazzo et al .",
    "in contrast , pair - members have a much wider distribution , going from normal to giant galaxies .",
    "following g93 , we would expect that shell - galaxies ( high @xmath1 and high mass in turn ) are old stellar systems , in which the young component formed during a recent interaction and/or merger episode is either too old or too weak to be able to affect the global mg indices .",
    "the fact that the _ strong lined _ pair - members show the same behavior of shell - galaxies ( i.e. deviation from the fe vs. mg2 relation and likely high [ mg / fe ] ratios ) whereas the _ weak - lined _ ones agree with the above relation and likely have _ normal _ [ mg / fe ] ratio , leads us to argue that a much larger spread in age ought to exist among pair - members as compared to shell - galaxies .",
    "checking this point requires the use of h@xmath0 as age indicator ( see below ) .    as our sample",
    "is composed of objects in interaction and/or post - interaction stages , the mean age of their stellar populations is less meaningful with respect to that of the _ normal _ ellipticals of g93 .",
    "in fact , an old age for the _ giant _ galaxies does not exclude the possible presence of a young component formed in a recent ( or ongoing ) event involving only a small percentage of the total mass of the galaxy .",

    "furthermore , any increase in the [ mg / fe ] is expected to be associated with a decrease in [ fe / h ] , and the two effects likely parallel each other in final determination of [ mgfe ] .",

    "the old stars are in turn represented by a ssp whose age is randomly chosen between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , parameters in the models .",
    "we are aware that this oversimplified scheme neglects the complex star formation histories of real galaxies and the ensuing mixture of stars with different chemical composition .",
    "integrated indices of ssps , resulting from multi - population models , have been investigated by idiart et al .",

    "the young stellar component , formed during the recent burst of star formation , is represented by a ssp whose age is randomly varied between 0.1 gyr and @xmath33 .",
    "the value of @xmath33 has been fixed to 1 gyr for 20 models in order to represent the 20 pair members .",

    "the strength of the secondary burst , represented by the percentage of the total mass turned into stars , is randomly chosen between 0 ( no secondary stellar activity ) and @xmath34 , a parameter of the models .",
    "since we are interested in guessing the minimum threshold above which the secondary episode has a sizable effect on the line strength indices , we will consider only the case in which the secondary episode involves a minor fraction of the galaxy mass .",

    "finally , random errors @xmath6log([mgfe ] ) @xmath36 0.011 and @xmath6log(h@xmath0 ) @xmath36 0.02 are applied to the model indices to better simulate observational data .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_hb_mg_sim ] we show an example of the 80 simulated galaxies for 4 different models .",
    "the aim is to highlight the effects of the underlying basic parameters , namely the epoch at which the bulk stars have been formed , the strength of the more recent burst episode , if any , and its age .    in panels ( a ) and ( b )",
    "galaxies are conceived as old , nearly coeval systems , their population being approximated by a single ssp with age between 14 and 16 gyr ; this corresponds to the current view of elliptical galaxies in rich clusters ( bower et al .",
    "the maximum intensity of the superposed burst amounts to 10% and 2% of the total mass , panels ( a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "inspection of the results shown in panel ( a ) indicates that model galaxies with a burst engaging a percentage of the total mass up to 10% predicts too high values of h@xmath0 and too many _ young _ objects . in contrast , the models of panel ( b ) span the range of h@xmath0 values indicated by the observations . in both cases , however , the expected distribution of objects with respect to the h@xmath0 index is at variance with the observational one .",
    "indeed models of this type predict a bimodal distribution , whereby the old galaxies ( those for which the burst is almost as old as the bulk of their stellar populations ) clump together in the lower portion of the diagram , whereas the `` young '' objects ( those with very young bursts ) form a tail extending to high values of h@xmath0 .",
    "the real clump is even narrower than displayed if one considers the effect of the simulated errors .",
    "the tail of `` young '' models agrees quite well with the observations , thus suggesting that the upper part of the diagram is populated by objects which experienced a recent burst of star formation of minor entity ( less than 2% of the total mass ) .",
    "the burst alone can not , however , explain the smooth distribution observed at low values of h@xmath0 .",
    "the reason for it is that the index h@xmath0 of a composite stellar population ( 2% of the mass is `` young '' stars and the remaining 98% in old stars ) , soon after the maximum excursion toward high values of h@xmath0 , fades out very rapidly as the young population ages . therefore catching a galaxy at intermediate values",
    "is highly improbable .",
    "slowing down the evolutionary rate of the `` young '' component by increasing the percentage of mass involved in the young burst produces an uncomfortably large fraction of objects in the upper part of the diagram , e.g. panel ( a ) .",
    "since a sort of fine tuning between the old and young component is not easy to understand , the viable alternative is that the old component spreads over significantly longer periods than assumed in the above simulations . to this aim , we present the models shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the _ old _ population in these models has an average age that spreads over a significant fraction of the hubble time .",
    "this is meant to indicate that either the object has been growing for such a long time with a low star formation rate , or that its major star formation activity was not confined to an early epoch .",
    "the young component is allowed to occur as in the simulations of panel ( b ) .",
    "it is immediately evident that the new models much better reproduce the distribution of galaxies all over the range of h@xmath0 .",
    "however , problems remain if the metallicity is randomly chosen . indeed",
    ", the model galaxies always tend to follow the path of an ssp , in these simulations the ssp with z=0.02 as shown in panel ( c ) .",
    "as already anticipated , real galaxies seem to follow a path steeper than that of ssp .",
    "we consider this point as evidence of an underlying relation between the age and metallicity of the bulk population of stars .",
    "panel ( d ) shows our final experiments , where the average metallicity of the bulk stars has been supposed to linearly increase with age from z=0.015 to z=0.04 .",
    "the broad range of metallicity is required by the large scatter in log([mgfe ] ) .",
    "if this suggestion is sounded , it would imply that young early type galaxies in the field are on average more metal - rich than old systems , with an average rate of metal - enrichment @xmath6log(z)/@xmath6log(t)@xmath37 - 0.7 .",
    "if confirmed , the vertical distribution of galaxies in this diagram is therefore _ the trace of a global metal enrichment taking place in galaxies during all the star forming episodes_.",
