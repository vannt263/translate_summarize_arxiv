    "when a black hole soft x - ray transient(sxt ) evolves from quiescence to an outburst , it may go through a series of state transitions , from a low / hard state in the rising phase of their outbursts to an intermediate state , a high / soft state , or even a very high state , which of these softer states a source reaches is probably related to the maximal mass accretion rate that an outburst achieves . for neutron star low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) system ,",
    "the spectral / timing state transition is shown in the color - color diagram ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) as movement from ` island ' state to ` banana ' state , with additional complicated movement toward / from lower x - ray luminosity ( muno , remillard & chakrabarty 2002 ; gierlinski & done 2002 ; barret & olive 2002 ) . in both neutron star and black hole system , _",
    "an apparent hard flare will be observed if there is an initial low / hard state associated with a state transition in the outburst rise_. such hard flares were observed in the outbursts of black holes xte j1550 - 564 ( wilson & done 2001 ; hannikainen et al .",

    "low / hard state occurs in the early outburst rise at the peak of the hard ` preceding ' flare for an individual outburst .",

    "the rise and the decay of an outburst has been explained in terms of the accretion disk approaching and receding from the compact object .",
    "such a picture is likely directly related to the hysteresis effect of state transitions during an outburst rise or decay ( miyamoto et al . 1994 ) , where hard - to - soft and soft - to - hard state transitions are different ",
    "one corresponds to the disk approaching the center and the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ( narayan & yi 1996 ) or the corona collapses , and the other corresponds to disk receding from the center perhaps because of disk evaporation ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ; meyer et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the above accretion geometry composed of a truncated accretion disk and a hot spherical adaf or corona at the center has been challenged by the long - term monitoring observations of some black hole x - ray binaries , which favor an accretion geometry containing two accretion flows ( smith , heindl & swank 2002 ) . in this paper , we show evidence supporting two accretion flows _ related in m_. our results also indicate that the x - ray luminosity corresponding to the hard - to - soft state transition during the outburst rise varies by a factor of 2 .",

    "we focus on xte j1550 - 564 , aquila x-1 and 4u 1705 - 44 , the _ only _ sources in which we found more than one outburst / flare ( i.e. two ) showing that the hard x - ray peak precedes the soft x - ray peak ( see below ) .",

    ", we plot the _ observed _ hexte peak flux vs. the asm peak flux for the outbursts or flares of xte j1550 - 564 , aquila x-1 , 4u 1705 - 44 , and several other sources .",
    "the uncertainties of peak flux because of lack of coverage are very small .",
    "the plot shows a proportionality between the hard x - ray peak flux and the delayed soft x - ray peak flux for each source .",
    "the data corresponding to the three sources are also roughly consistent with a single linear proportionality , indicating similar _ observed _ energy spectra among these sources .",
    "deviation from the proportionality may come from different galactic or intrinsic absorption among sources .    because the energy spectra corresponding to the hard state of the same source for different outbursts are very similar ( xte j1550 - 564 : sobczak et al .",

    "; 4u 1705 - 44 : barret & olive 2002 ) , the x - ray luminosity corresponding to the start of the hard - to - soft state transition is roughly described by either asm rate or hexte rate at the peak of the ` preceding ' hard flare of an outburst ( see yu et al .",
    "2003 ) . using the same spectral model for the same source ( 4u 1705 - 44 and aql x-1 : same model as used in barret & olive 2002",
    "; xte j1550 - 564 : blackbody + cut - off power law + gaussian line at 6.4 kev ) , we have derived the unabsorbed peak x - ray flux at the peak of the hard flare . the flux , or the x - ray luminosity , can vary by a factor of 2.5 .",
    "this suggests that the hard - to - soft state transition does not occur at a constant x - ray luminosity for the same source .",
    "we have investigated the rxte pointed observations of the outbursts of the black hole transient xte j1550 - 564 and the neutron star transient aquila x-1 , together with those of the flares of the quasi - persistent neutron star lmxb 4u 1705 - 44 .",
    "two instances of a ` preceding ' hard x - ray flare were observed in each source ( note : the outbursts discussed here are only those in which the source could reach the point of state transition in the outburst rise .",
    "the low amplitude low / hard state outbursts are out of the scope of this paper ) .",
    "we find that the hexte peak flux is proportional to the asm peak flux , which the source reached a few days to several weeks later .",
    "we show that the x - ray luminosity corresponding to the hard - to - soft state transition can vary by a factor of more than two for the _ same _ source .",
    "if the x - ray luminosity is an indicator of the mass accretion rate on the outburst time scale , a varying x - ray luminosity of the hard - to - soft state transition shows that the transition is not solely determined by the mass accretion rate .",
    "we have demonstrated that for an individual source , the brighter the initial low / hard state of the outburst is , the brighter the later high / soft state will be .",
    "this is contrary to what is predicted by models that attribute the state transition to a change in a single mass accretion rate ( examples of such models are e.g esin et al . 1998 ; meyer , liu & meyer - hofmeister 2000 ) . in the disk - instability model of soft x - ray transient outbursts ,",
    "the energy reservoir of the x - ray outburst is the material accumulated in the accretion disk during ` quiescence ' .",
    "if an outburst consumes almost all the material in the disk , the outburst size should correlate with the disk mass .",
    "the more massive the disk is , the bigger the outburst will be , and the bigger both the hard and the soft flares will be .",
    "disk mass provides the additional parameter that determines the state transition .",
    "if this also holds for the state transition during the outburst decay , it should occur at a lower x - ray luminosity than that during the rise because of a less massive disk ( assuming the same physics applies ) .",
    "this agrees with the observations  the so - called hysteresis effect ( miyamoto et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the correlation between the hard x - ray peak flux and the soft x - ray peak flux of the outbursts indicates that the outbursts are set up early . at the time when",
    "the hard - to - soft state transition occurs and the hard x - ray peak flux is known , the soft x - ray peak flux of the outburst can already be predicted as the entire outburst scales with the hard peak flux .",
    "the correlation between the hard x - ray peak flux and the soft x - ray peak flux requires a link between an earlier accretion flow / outflow which generates the hard x - ray flare and a later accretion flow which produces the soft x - ray outburst . in the single flow comptonization models for the low / hard state which are composed of disk and corona ( for a recent review",
    "see nowak 2002 ) , the correlation requires the hard x - ray photons to originate from inverse comptonization of low energy photons in ultraviolet or optical from the disk flow further away from the central compact object , which produces the soft x - ray outburst peak at a later time when it propagates to the center .",
    "this requires future observations to confirm a correlation between the ultraviolet or optical flux and the hard x - ray flux in the rise of the low / hard state , as required by the inverse comptonization models . on the other hand ,",
    "our results supports a two - accretion - flow geometry at the beginning of a sxt outburst ; at the start of the outburst rise , a non - disk flow arrives earlier from the outer disk and generates the hard x - ray flux , while the optically thick disk flow propagates inward on a viscous time scale ( in a model involving a halo flow being an adaf flow or a corona flow , the disk s propagation inward may be also related to a simultaneous collapse or contrast of the central adaf or corona ) .",
    "the time lag between the two flows depends on the initial inner disk radius at the start of the outbursts .",
    "this is consistent with the model proposed by chakrabarti & titarchuk ( 1995 ) .",
    "a consideration of a sub - keplerian corona flow originated from disk evaporation moving above the disk rather than comoving with the disk flow in the adaf+disk+corona model ( e.g. meyer , liu & meyer - hofmeister 2000 ) may also explain the observations .",
    "smith , heindl & swank ( 2002 ) discussed supporting evidence for such two simultaneous , independent accretion flows in several black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "our study is on the outburst rise , different to the count rate decrease discussed in smith , heindl & swank ( 2002 ) , and includes both black hole and neutron star x - ray binaries .",
    "furthermore , our study indicates that _ the two accretion flows are related in m _ ; the two accretion flows are supplied with approximately _ proportional _ amounts of matter among the outbursts of the same source .",
    "it is worth noting that a similar two - related - accretion - flow geometry was used to interpret the ` parallel tracks ' in the plot of khz qpo frequency and the x - ray flux in neutron star lmxbs ( van der klis 2002 ) .",
    "as all the three sources in our study are known to be lmxbs , this relation may only apply to lmxb outbursts .",
    "the two - accretion - flow geometry suggests that the accretion state depends on which accretion flow dominates .",
    "if the observed accretion state is solely a consequence of the competition of the two flows , the critical x - ray luminosity corresponding to the appearance of the ` propeller ' regime for accreting neutron stars ( lamb , pethick & pines 1973 ; illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) is not expected to be a constant but to vary with the composition of the two accretion flows .",
    "this implies that during the outburst rise , if the x - ray luminosity is below the level of the hard - to - soft state transition , the x - ray luminosity corresponding to the ` propeller ' state might relate to the ` propeller ' state of the halo flow ; while during the outburst decay , if the x - ray luminosity is above the level of the soft - to - hard state transition , the x - ray luminosity corresponding to the ` propeller ' state might relate to the ` propeller ' state of the disk flow . the difference between the two accretion flows probably also introduces differences in the energy spectrum in the ` propeller ' state .",
    "the competition of the two accretion flows and the ` propeller ' mechanism may jointly contribute to the complexities of the spectral variation at low x - ray luminosity ranges ( see e.g. color - intensity diagram of aql x-1 shown in muno , remillard & chakrabarty 2002 ) .",
    "the association of the preceding hard x - ray flux with a halo flow rather than a disk flow can also put some constraints on the viscosity of the hot halo flow compared with the disk flow .",
    "the rise of the ` preceding ' hard flare from the ` quiescent ' level in this sources has a time scale of several days to several weeks ( @xmath1 ) , while the rise of the soft x - ray outburst has a time scale of several weeks ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the ratio between @xmath2 and @xmath1 is about 2 - 3 .",
    "thus if the two - accretion - flow model is correct , then the non - disk flow is a sub - keplerian flow rather than a free - fall flow . assuming that @xmath2 and @xmath1 are related with the viscous time scales @xmath3 , and the viscosity of either the halo flow or the disk flow is similar among sources , @xmath2 and @xmath1 may reflect the size of the central hole in the disk and the disk size at the start of an outburst , respectively .",
    "our results may also support the accretion geometry composed of an inner jet / outflow and an outer disk flow in which the jet / outflow generates the hard x - rays and the disk flow generates the soft x - rays ( e.g. markoff , falcke & fender 2001 ) . in this case , the correlation we found requires that the base of the jet is related to the disk flow and there is a close relationship between the peak powers of the two .",
    "the more massive the disk is , the stronger the jet will be ( see also garcia et al .",
    "this might suggest that the lifetime of the jet / outflow is more sensitive to the inner radius of the disk flow than the disk flow luminosity .",
    "fender & kuulkers ( 2001 ) show that soft x - ray peak luminosity also correlates with the radio peak luminosity .",
    "so our results predict that the radio peak flux correlates with the hard x - ray peak .",
