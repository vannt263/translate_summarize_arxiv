    "[ fig : kinematics ] , we compare the subdwarf metallicity classes to the m dwarf sample @xcite as a function of @xmath3 color .",
    "some immediate trends are obvious .",
    "first , the total subdwarf sample ( open diamonds ) has larger velocity dispersions at all color bins , when compared to the m dwarf sample ( red filled circles ) . while velocity dispersions within the disk are thought to increase roughly as the square  root of age ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to disk heating , the halo dispersion is governed by the galactic potential .",
    "this implies that velocity dispersions do not closely follow the relative age differences .",
    "however , both observational @xcite and theoretical investigations @xcite demonstrate that halo subdwarfs comprise an older , metal  poor population than nearby disk stars .",
    "the bluer @xmath3 bins contain subdwarfs with dispersions of @xmath94 km s@xmath16 .",
    "the typical uncertainty in each dispersion measurement is @xmath95 km s@xmath16 .",
    "these dispersions suggest the stars are drawn from the inner halo @xcite .",
    "moreover , the radial ( @xmath35 ) and vertical ( @xmath38 ) dispersions increase with decreasing metallicity for most bins , following trends seem in other studies @xcite .",
    "similar to the m dwarfs , the smallest velocity dispersions are seen in the reddest three @xmath3 bins in the @xmath38 direction , indicating that subdwarfs with these colors may possess orbits with some ordered rotation , and suggesting that these stars are drawn from the thick disk . in table",
    "[ table : disps ] , we list the velocity dispersions for each spectral subclass as a function of @xmath3 color , as well as the disk m dwarfs from @xcite .",
    "the statistical parallax method assumes that each subsample is composed of a kinematically homogenous population which can be described by a velocity ellipsoid .",
    "some metal  poor stellar samples have contained stars from the thick disk and halo , which possess different underlying kinematics @xcite . if a given subsample was comprised of similar numbers of thick disk and halo subdwarfs , a simple one component fit would not be valid .",
    "we constructed probability plots @xcite to test the validity of this assumption .",
    "space motions were calculated from the proper motions and radial velocities from sdss , along with distances estimated from the @xmath10 relation in equation [ eqn : phots ] .",
    "an illustrative example of the probability plots are shown in figure [ fig : prob_plots ] .",
    "the @xmath35 and @xmath38 probability plots for the @xmath90 bin for the various metallicity subclasses are plotted .",
    "probability plots are related to cumulative distribution functions , with the abscissae calculated in units of standard deviation .",
    "hence , a gaussian distribution would be plotted as a line , with a slope equal to the dispersion .",
    "populations consisting of multiple gaussians would be manifested as a segmented line ( see figure 3 of @xcite for an example ) .",
    "the probability plots show that the underlying distributions are well described by a single component , validating our assumption .     and @xmath38 velocity distributions of the @xmath90 bin .",
    "each line is described in the legend .",
    "the various metallicity subclasses are well described by a single component , validating our assumption of kinematic homogeneity within each subsample .",
    "the @xmath36 velocity probability plot was omitted since the distribution is non - gaussian due to asymmetric drift , an effect which is included in the statistical parallax analysis . ]",
    "we have described the statistical parallax analysis of low  mass subdwarfs contained in the sdss catalog @xcite .",
    "we divided our sample by color , metallicity subclass , and photometric properties to further explore the kinematics and intrinsic brightnesses of these metal  poor stars .",
    "we developed a photometric proxy of metallicity for low ",
    "mass subdwarfs , derived photometric parallax relations , and explored the mean motions and dispersions with respect to their metal  rich counterparts .",
    "metallicity can influence the color  magnitude relations of low  mass stars .",
    "while this has been directly measured for more massive stars in the @xmath9 photometric system @xcite , there has not been a detailed study for low  mass stars .",
    "we expanded on the initial analysis of @xcite to include subdwarfs with lower metallicity , as measured by the proxy @xmath0 .",
    "we demonstrated that different metallicity subclasses ( sdm , esdm and usdm ) cleanly separated in various color  magnitude diagrams .",
    "the one nearby subdwarf with a precise trigonometric parallax and @xmath9 photometry agrees with our derived relations .    while deriving color ",
    "absolute magnitude relations for various spectral subclasses does demonstrate the influence of metallicity on the intrinsic brightness of stars , it requires that spectroscopic observations are available .",
    "the largest current and future surveys , such as panstarrs and lsst , will be purely photometric , limiting the application of the spectral type relations .",
    "we ameliorated this situation by deriving @xmath1 , a photometric proxy for metallicity based on a star s @xmath2 and @xmath3 colors .",
    "mass subdwarfs have redder @xmath2 colors than their solar ",
    "metallicity counterparts @xcite and we quantified this effect by measuring the @xmath49 color  color locus for main sequence m dwarfs .",
    "the photometric metallicity parameter @xmath1 , reasonably traces the spectroscopically determined @xmath0 values for low ",
    "mass subdwarfs , with some scatter , and complements earlier investigations by @xcite for solar metallicity m dwarfs .",
    "these relations have potential to be a powerful tool in photometrically identifying low  mass subdwarfs .",
    "the kinematic properties of subdwarfs were also explored in this study .",
    "the entire sample was compared to disk m dwarfs , and some clear differences were seen .",
    "first , the mean @xmath36 velocity of bluer subdwarfs is near 200 km s@xmath16 , suggesting this population is largely non  rotating .",
    "these objects possess halo  type orbits , with high eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the bluest ( in @xmath3 ) subdwarfs was similar to other measurements of the milky way s inner halo .",
    "the redder @xmath3 bins contained stars with kinematics similar to the thick disk .    the milky way s halo has yet to be mapped by its most numerous inhabitant , low  mass subdwarfs .",
    "while existing surveys , such as sdss and 2mass have offered a small glimpse into the low ",
    "mass components of the halo , this phase space is largely unexplored .",
    "the relations derived in this study will enable easier identification and characterization of these objects in the next generation of astronomical surveys , such as lsst and gaia .",
    "these surveys will probe the halo _ in situ _ and offer the most detailed picture of its kinematic and structural composition .",
