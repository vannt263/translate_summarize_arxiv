    "a central problem in pattern recognition and computer vision is to detect whether a certain object corresponds to one of the objects stored in a database .",
    "the goal is to identify the given object as one of the objects in the database , and therefore to classify it or to consider it as unknown .",
    "when the objects involved in the recognition process are planar and defined by their silhouettes , algebraic curves can be used .",
    "for instance , in this setting silhouettes of aircraft prototypes @xcite and of sea animals @xcite have previously been considered .    however , the two objects to be compared need not be in the same position , orientation , or scale . in order to compare the two objects , it should therefore be checked whether there exists a nontrivial movement , also called _ similarity _ , transforming the object to be analyzed into the possible target in the database .",
    "this problem , known in the computer vision literature as _ pose estimation _ , has been extensively considered using many different techniques , using b - splines @xcite , fourier descriptors @xcite , complex representations @xcite , statistics @xcite also in the 3d case , moments @xcite , geometric invariants @xcite , newton - puiseux parametrizations @xcite , and differential invariants @xcite .",
    "the interested reader may consult the bibliographies in these papers to find other references on the matter .",
    "with exception for the references concerning the b - splines and differential invariants , the above methods use the implicit form of the curves . moreover , the above methods are either numerical , or only efficient when considered in a numerical setting .",
    "the reason for this is that in pattern recognition it is often assumed that the inputs are `` fuzzy '' .",
    "for instance , in many cases the objects are represented discretely as point clouds . in this situation ,",
    "an implicit equation is usually first computed for each cloud , and the comparison is performed later . in other cases",
    "there may be occluded parts or noise in the input .",
    "alternatively the input might be exact , but modeling a real object only up to a certain extent . in all of these cases",
    "we do not need an perfect matching , so that a numerical comparison is sufficient .    in this paper",
    ", we address the problem from a perspective that differs in two ways .",
    "first of all , we assume that the curves are given in _ exact _ arithmetic , so that we can provide a deterministic answer to the question whether these two curves are similar .",
    "if so , our algorithm will find the similarities transforming one into the other .",
    "a second difference is that we start from rationally , or piecewise rationally , _",
    "parametrized _ curves and carry out all computations in the parameter space . as a consequence , the cost of converting to the implicit form , both in terms of computing time and growth of the coefficients , is avoided .",
    "this representation is important in applications of computer - aided geometric design . in cad - based systems , for instance",
    ", curves are typically represented by means of piecewise - rational parametrizations , usually of moderate degrees , like ( rational ) bzier curves , splines and nurbs . therefore ,",
    "if the comparison is to be made between these representations , an algorithm based on the parametric form is desirable .    a first potential application of the ideas in the paper is related to computer algebra systems .",
    "assume that a database with classical curves is stored in your favourite computer algebra system .",
    "using the algorithms in this paper , the system can recognize a certain curve introduced by the user as one of the curves in the database .",
    "this way , the user can identify a curve as , say , a cardioid , an epitrochoid , a deltoid , etc .    a second application is related to computer graphics . in this field , the recognition of similarities simplifies manipulating and storing images , since in the presence of a similarity we need to store only one image , and the similarity producing the other . in the case of curves represented by bzier curves or splines",
    ", one can detect similarity by checking whether the corresponding control polygons are similar .",
    "this is easy , because the control polygons are piecewise linear objects .",
    "however , this is less clear in the case of rational bzier curves or nurbs . furthermore , if one is not interested in global similarities but in _ partial _ similarities , i.e. , in determining whether parts of the objects are similar , then it is no longer clear how to derive this from the control polygons .",
    "in addition , any algorithm to find the similarities between rational curves is also an algorithm to find the symmetries of a rational curve , since an algebraic curve is self - similar if and only if it is symmetric ; see proposition [ prop : sym ] .",
    "symmetry detection has been massively addressed in the field of computer graphics to gain understanding when analyzing pictures , and also in order to perform tasks like compression , shape editing , and shape completion ; see for instance @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "we exploit and generalize some ideas used in @xcite for the computation of symmetries of rational plane curves , improving the algorithm provided in @xcite .",
    "our approach exploits the rational parametrizations to reduce to calculations in the parameter domain , and therefore to operations on univariate polynomials .",
    "thus we proceed symbolically to determine the existence and computation of such similarities , using basic polynomial multiplication , gcd - computations .",
    "additionally , if a numerical approximation is desired , univariate polynomial real - solving must be used as well .",
    "we have implemented and tested this algorithm in the system @xcite .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , as a by - product , we achieve an algorithm to detect whether a given rational curve is symmetric and to find such symmetries .",
    "this problem has previously been studied from a deterministic point of view @xcite , and by many authors from an approximate point of view .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following .",
    "some generalities on similarities and symmetries , to be used throughout the paper , are established in section [ sec - prelim ] .",
    "the method itself is addressed in section [ sec - detect-2 ] , first for polynomially parametrized curves and then for the general case .",
    "the case of piecewise rational curves is addressed at the end of this section .",
    "finally , practical details on the implementation , including timings , are provided in section [ sec - implem ] .",
    "throughout the paper , we consider rational plane algebraic curves @xmath0 that are neither a line nor a circle . such curves are _ irreducible _ , i.e. , they are the zero sets of polynomials that can not be factored over the reals , and can be parametrized by rational maps @xmath1 the components @xmath2 of @xmath3 are rational functions of @xmath4 , and they are defined for all but a finite number of values of @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the parametrizations are _ proper _ , i.e. , birational or , equivalently , injective except for perhaps finitely many values of @xmath4 . in particular , the parametrizations have a rational inverse defined on their images .",
    "this is no restriction on the curves @xmath5 , as any rational curve always admits a proper parametrization . for proofs of these claims and for a thorough study on properness ,",
    "see @xcite .    roughly speaking , an _ ( affine ) similarity _ of the plane is a linear affine map from the plane to itself that preserves ratios of distances .",
    "more precisely , a map @xmath6 is a similarity if @xmath7 for an invertible matrix @xmath8 and a vector @xmath9 , and there exists an @xmath10 such that @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the euclidean norm .",
    "we refer to @xmath13 as the _ ratio _ of the similarity . notice that if @xmath14 then @xmath15 is an _ ( affine ) isometry _ , in the sense that it preserves distances .",
    "the similarities of the plane form a group under composition , and the isometries form a subgroup .",
    "it is well known , and easy to derive , that a similarity can be decomposed into a translation , an orthogonal transformation , and a uniform scaling by its ratio @xmath13 .",
    "the curves @xmath16 are _ similar _ , if one is the image of the other under a similarity .    for analyzing the similarities of the plane , we have found it useful to identify the euclidean plane with the complex plane . through this correspondence @xmath17",
    ", the parametrizations correspond to parametrizations @xmath18 we can distinguish two cases for a similarity of the complex plane .",
    "a similarity @xmath15 is either _ orientation preserving _ , in which case it takes the form @xmath19 , or _ orientation reversing _ , in which case it takes the form @xmath20 . in each case , its ratio @xmath21 .",
    "a _ mbius transformation _ is a rational function @xmath22 it is well known that the birational functions on the line are the mbius transformations @xcite .",
    "[ th - fund ] let @xmath23 be rational plane curves with proper parametrizations @xmath24 .",

    "then there exists a similarity @xmath15 of the plane that restricts to a bijection @xmath30 . since @xmath31 are proper , their inverses @xmath32 exist as rational functions on @xmath16 .",
    "the composition @xmath33 is therefore also a rational function with inverse @xmath34 , which is rational as well .",
    "hence , @xmath35 is a birational transformation on the real line , implying that it must be a mbius transformation .",
    "clearly this choice of @xmath15 and @xmath27 makes the diagram commute .",
    "conversely , suppose we are given a similarity @xmath15 of the plane and a mbius transformation @xmath27 that makes the diagram commute .",
    "the similarity @xmath15 maps any point @xmath36 to @xmath37 , which lies in the image of @xmath38 and therefore on the curve @xmath26 .",
    "it follows that @xmath25 and @xmath26 must be similar .",
    "for the final claim , suppose that there are two mbius transformations @xmath39 making the diagram commute .",
    "then @xmath40 .",
    "since the parametrization @xmath38 is proper , we conclude @xmath41 .",
    "although the final claim refers to a mbius transformation @xmath27 that is unique , its coefficients , i.e. , @xmath42 in , are only defined up to a common multiple .",
    "since @xmath27 maps the real line to itself , these coefficients can always be assumed to be real by dividing by a common complex number if necessary .",
    "depending on whether @xmath15 preserves or reverses the orientation of the complex plane , the diagram will either take the form @xmath43 or @xmath44    next , let @xmath45 be a rational plane curve , neither a line nor a circle , given by a proper rational map @xmath46 a _ self - similarity _ @xmath15 of @xmath45 is a similarity of the plane satisfying @xmath47 .",

    "moreover , since @xmath45 is not the union of concurrent lines , at least one other form @xmath53 , with @xmath54 , must be nonzero .",

    ". then @xmath15 has a unique fixed point @xmath56 , which we can without loss of generality assume to be located at the origin by applying an affine change of coordinates if necessary .",
    "hence , in these coordinates @xmath45 has the symmetry @xmath57 , so that it is also the zeroset of @xmath58 , which therefore must be a scalar multiple of @xmath59 . since this scalar",

    "next consider the case that @xmath67 is an orientation - reversing symmetry .",
    "then it also has the ( possibly trivial ) orientation - preserving symmetry @xmath68 , which must be an isometry by the above paragraph .",
    "it follows that @xmath69 and therefore that @xmath15 must be an isometry .",
    "the isometries of the plane form a group under composition , which consists of _ reflections _",
    "@xmath70 , which reflect in the line @xmath71 , _ rotations _",
    "@xmath72 , which rotate around a point @xmath73 , _ translations _",
    "@xmath74 , and _ glide reflections _",
    ", which are a composition of a reflection and a translation @xcite .",
    "an isometry of the plane leaving @xmath45 invariant , is more commonly known as a _ symmetry _ of @xmath45 .",

    "[ thsim ] let @xmath5 be two distinct , irreducible , similar , algebraic curves , neither of them a line or a circle .",

    "conversely , if @xmath25 has a nontrivial symmetry @xmath81 , then @xmath82 is an additional similarity mapping @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "in this section we derive a procedure for detecting whether the curves @xmath16 are similar by an orientation preserving similarity . in this case , by theorem [ th - fund ] , equation holds for some similarity @xmath83 and a mbius transformation @xmath27 .",
    "the case of an orientation reversing similarity is analogous , by replacing @xmath38 by @xmath84 .",
    "we first attack the simpler case when @xmath31 are polynomial .",
    "after that we consider the case when either @xmath85 or @xmath38 is not polynomial , while distinguishing between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , with @xmath88 as in . in each case our strategy is to eliminate @xmath89 and reduce to a simpler problem in the parameter space , i.e. , downstairs in the diagram .",
    "once we obtain the possible mbius transformations downstairs , they can be lifted to corresponding similarities upstairs .",
    "a curve is _ polynomial _ if it admits a polynomial parametrization .",
    "it is easy to check whether a rational parametrization defines a polynomial curve , and to quickly compute a polynomial parametrization in that case ; see @xcite for both statements . as a consequence",

    "notice that if @xmath16 are similar and one of them is polynomial , then the other must be polynomial as well .    for polynomial parametrizations @xmath31 , the right hand side in is polynomial , implying that the left hand side is polynomial as well .",
    "it follows that in that case the corresponding mbius transformation @xmath27 should be linear affine , i.e. , @xmath90 . in this section",
    "we assume that the curves @xmath5 are related by a similarity whose corresponding mbius transformation is of this form .",
    "this includes similar polynomial curves as a special case , but also other rational curves needed for the case treated in section [ subcase-2 ] .",
    "we require some mild assumptions on our parametrization @xmath85 , namely that @xmath85 , and therefore also its derivatives @xmath91 , are well defined at @xmath92 and that @xmath91 are nonzero at @xmath92 .",
    "notice that there are only finitely many parameters @xmath4 for which one of these conditions does not hold , so these conditions hold after applying an appropriate , or even random , linear affine change of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "evaluating at @xmath92 yields @xmath93 to get rid of @xmath73 , we differentiate and evaluate at @xmath92 , which gives @xmath94 differentiating twice and evaluating at @xmath95 yields @xmath96 the unknowns @xmath97 and @xmath98 are nonzero since @xmath15 and @xmath27 are invertible , and @xmath99 are not identically zero because @xmath26 is not a line . dividing by yields @xmath100 which does not involve @xmath97 or @xmath73 .",
    "since the mbius transformation @xmath90 maps the real line to itself , both @xmath98 and @xmath101 are required to be real .",

    "if @xmath122 , this curve is a logarithmic spiral , which is a non - algebraic curve and therefore contradicts that @xmath123 and @xmath107 are rational .",
    "if @xmath124 , on the other hand , then the arc length @xmath125 of @xmath38 is constant , which again implies that @xmath26 is a line @xcite .    as a consequence , we obtain a polynomial condition @xmath126 on @xmath101 , where @xmath127 is the numerator of the imaginary part of @xmath98 in , with @xmath128 as above .",
