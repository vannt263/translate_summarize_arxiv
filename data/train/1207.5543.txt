    "the circumnuclear gas located on 1  1000 pc scale from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is an important constituent in several intriguing , but poorly known processes .",
    "it is the source of agn fuel , and it absorbs agn energy and momentum via winds , radiation and/or jets . understanding the properties of this gas is crucial to constrain theories of these processes , and their possible connection to star formation in the host bulge , which is implied from the central black hole  bulge relations ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "some of the properties of this gas have been inferred by examining how photons from the central source are reprocessed into secondary radiation .",
    "the agn radiation is mainly converted either into thermal ir emission from dust grains embedded in the gas , or to permitted and forbidden emission lines .",
    "these emission lines are observed with widths of @xmath15 , typical of the galaxy potential .",
    "the region that emits the lines is termed the narrow line region ( nlr ) , as opposed to the broad line region ( blr , @xmath16 ) , which is located on smaller scales , within the black hole gravitational sphere of influence .",
    "the nlr is used to constrain the radial distribution of the circumnuclear gas ( ferguson et al .",
    "1997 ) , and to infer the agn bolometric luminosity @xmath6 when other measures are not available ( e.g. kauffmann & heckman 2009 ; schawinski et al .",
    "this circumnuclear gas may also block our line of sight to the inner ionizing source and blr , thus playing a role in the unobscured ( type 1 ) / obscured ( type 2 ) agn dichotomy .",
    "how does the distribution of the circumnuclear gas depend on @xmath6 and black hole mass @xmath17 ? there is some evidence that the covering factor cf of the ir emitting gas decreases with @xmath6 ( maiolino et al .",
    "2007 , treister et al . 2008 ) , as does the type 2 / type 1 ratio ( hasinger 2008 ) .",
    "the dependence of the nlr covering factor , @xmath18 , on luminosity has not been directly explored , though there may be some indications that @xmath18 is higher at low agn luminosity ( ludwig et al .",
    "2012 ) . also , at high @xmath6 , where the host contribution to the continuum is negligible , a decrease in  equivalent width with luminosity has been observed ( sulentic et al .",
    "2004 , netzer et al .",
    "2006 , ludwig et al .",
    "2009 ) , which may also imply a luminosity - dependent @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , in the classical type 1 / type 2 agn division , the broad lines either dominate the permitted lines or are not observed at all . this division is unsatisfactory , as the broad and narrow components of the permitted lines show a large range in flux ratio between different objects ( e.g. fig . 1 of stern & laor 2012 , hereafter paper i ) . following osterbrock ( 1977 )",
    ", ` intermediate types ' were added to the scheme ",
    "type 1.2s , 1.5s and 1.8s , with larger numbers corresponding to higher narrow to broad flux ratios .",
    "if in type 1 agn we have a direct view of the blr , and in type 2 agn the blr is obscured , what then are the intermediate types ?",
    "a simple interpolation of the above scheme may imply that the blr is either partially obscured or undergoes extinction by optically thin dust .",
    "partial obscuration is clearly a factor in agn , as can be seen in spectropolarimetric surveys ( e.g. tran 2003 ) that show objects in which a ` hidden ' blr is revealed in the polarized spectrum .",
    "evidence for dust reddening of the blr has also been found in intermediate type samples ( e.g. goodrich et al .",
    ". however , trippe et al . (",
    "2010 ) find that the majority of intermediate types in their sample are inconsistent with reddening of the blr , which suggests another mechanism may be important in driving the intermediate type phenomenon .",
    "an alternative mechanism is that intermediate type agn are not obscured , like ` standard ' type 1s , but have a large @xmath19 ratio .",
    "as we show below , this mechanism appears to dominate in low luminosity agn .    in this paper",
    ", we use the type 1 sample described in paper i. the sample is based on the detection of broad  emission , which in some objects is relatively weak compared to the narrow  emission , classifying them as intermediate type agn .",
    "the sample spans @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we derive the nlr luminosity and fraction of intermediate types , for different @xmath6 and @xmath17 . using these relations between the nlr and agn properties ,",
    "we explore various mechanisms proposed to explain the intermediate type phenomenon .",
    "we also calibrate the luminosity - dependent @xmath22}}}}$ ] ratio , for use of future studies based on type 2 agn .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we give a summary of the sample selection and emission line measurements described in paper i , emphasizing the measurements of  and narrow , used here . in ",
    "3 we present our main result , the increase in relative nlr luminosity and in the fraction of intermediate type agn with decreasing luminosity . the relative nlr luminosity is also compared to @xmath23 and @xmath17 . in ",
    "4 we compare our results to earlier studies . the possible physical mechanisms behind the observed trend are examined in  5 . we discuss the implications in  6 , and provide conclusions in  7 .    throughout the paper ,",

    "narrow lines are fit using 4@xmath30-order gauss - hermite functions ( ghs ; van der marel & franx 1993 ) and an up to 10@xmath30-order gh is used for the broad  profile .",
    "the following criteria are applied to the broad  fit , in order to exclude objects in which the residual flux is not clearly blr emission : the fwhm ( @xmath41 ) of the fit is required to be in the range @xmath42 ; the total flux of the fit , and its flux density at the line centre , are required to be significant .",

    "the galex mission ( martin et al . 2005 , morrissey et al . 2007 ) observed 2/3 of the sky in the fuv ( effective wavelength 1528 ) and nuv ( 2271 ) bands .",

    "only 0.4% of the t1 objects were targeted for spectroscopy by the sdss solely for being near a rosat source .",

    "we note that the  absorption feature in hao es1 has @xmath60 , compared to the typical @xmath61 of other absorption features , indicating the intrinsic width dominates the width of the feature .",

    "another mechanism that can reduce the observed blr emission is an optically thick obscurer that partially covers the blr .",
    "the following quantitative argument can be applied to decide whether partial obscuration is a likely mechanism behind the majority of intermediate types .    a partial obscuration of the blr in a significant number of objects requires an absorbers size , @xmath195 , which is comparable to the size of the blr , @xmath196 .",
    "the typical @xmath197  km  @xmath27 , implies that the blr arises from a distance of @xmath198 from the center , while the accretion disk uv continuum arises from a distance of @xmath199 .",
    "thus , @xmath200 , and the absorber will either completely absorb the uv source , or not absorb it at all .",

    ". therefore the ionization rate , and consequently the recombination line flux , will increase with @xmath240 only up to a threshold @xmath241 , where the dust and gas opacities are comparable ( laor & draine 1993 ) . at @xmath242 , dust dominates the opacity , only @xmath243 of the ionizing photons are absorbed by the gas , and the emitted recombination line flux is only weakly dependent on @xmath240 .",
    "this local effect persists when integrating over the entire cloud , using the @xmath240 at the cloud surface ( netzer & laor 1993 ) , and also when accounting for the effect of radiation pressure on the density profile ( dopita et al .",

    "evidence for the existence of these clouds was presented by netzer & laor ( 1993 ) , which showed that dust bounded clouds naturally explain the spatial gap between the blr and nlr , and why the intermediate region emits mainly in the ir ( the ` torus ' ) .",
    "also , dust bounded clouds can account for the small scatter in @xmath240 observed in the nlr ( dopita et al .",

    "we denote the covering factor of the circumnuclear gas , which can be different from @xmath18 due to dust absorption , as @xmath245 .",
