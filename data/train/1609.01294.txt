    "some years ago , the presence of two red clumps ( rcs ) was discovered in the high - latitude ( @xmath3 6 ) fields of the milky way bulge @xcite .",
    "the origin of this double rc , however , is currently under intense debate .",
    "it was initially interpreted as evidence for an x - shaped structure that originated from the disk and bar instabilities @xcite . in this picture , the two rcs separated by @xmath10.5 mag is due to the difference in distance between the two arms of the x - shaped structure .",
    "we have recently suggested ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) , however , a drastically different interpretation based on the multiple stellar population phenomenon , which is widely observed in globular clusters ( gcs ) including metal - rich bulge gcs terzan  5 , ngc  6388 , and ngc  6441 @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the brighter rc ( brc ) is from helium enhanced second - generation stars ( g2 ) , which are intrinsically brighter , while the faint rc ( frc ) is originated from the first - generation stars ( g1 ) with normal helium abundance .",
    "soon after our suggestion , two counterarguments were presented .",
    "firstly , the longitude dependence of the double rc feature at @xmath2 was pointed out by @xcite as a potential problem of our model .",
    "secondly , by employing the wise mid - ir image , @xcite report a direct detection of a faint x - shaped structure in the milky way bulge . however , each of them can be rebutted . in a composite bulge , where a classical bulge is embedded in a tilted bar ( e.g. ,",

    "* ) , we have already shown in that our models can reproduce the longitude dependence well , which is also discussed in section  3 of this paper with more realistic treatments . the second argument on the presence of a faint x - shaped structure",
    "is highly questioned as well , because when an ellipsoid is subtracted from a boxy structure , as has been done by @xcite , an artificial x - shaped structure always remains ( d. han & y .- w .",
    "lee , in prep . ;",
    "see also @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , if the x - shaped structure is solely responsible for the observed double rc , @xmath145@xmath4 of stars in the bulge are predicted to be on the orbits that make this structure @xcite .",
    "however , even if real , the stellar density in the claimed x - shaped structure of @xcite appears to be way too low to be observed as a strong double rc at @xmath5 . a crucial evidence against the x - shaped bulge was also presented by @xcite from the analysis of the main - sequence stars in the bulge fields . without critical distance information ,",
    "therefore , the origin of the double rc phenomenon is still an open question , and the multiple population scenario merits more detailed investigations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the parameter space in our multiple population models to see the effects of metallicity , age , and helium abundance on the double rc feature .",
    "we have also used these models to illustrate how the point raised by @xcite can be explained in our scenario .",
    "population models presented in this study are based on and the techniques previously developed by @xcite and @xcite . as in ,",
    "the yonsei - yale ( y@xmath6 ) isochrones and horizontal - branch ( hb ) evolutionary tracks @xcite were used to construct the models for the normal and helium - enhanced subpopulations , with the assumption of the fixed @xmath7-elements enhancement ( [ @xmath8=0.3 $ ] ) .",
    "parameters regarding the hb models , such as @xcite mass - loss coefficient ( @xmath9 ) and the mass dispersion on hb stars ( @xmath10 ) , are also identical to those adopted in  .",
    "color - temperature transformation was performed by employing the color table of @xcite and the stellar model atmospheres of @xcite . in order to more clearly see the effect of parameter changes on the synthetic rc , we present only single metallicity models in this paper .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows our synthetic color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for the two rcs at four different metallicity regimes , which are almost identical to those presented in figure  1 of , but here ( @xmath11 ) cmds are also added in the right panels .",
    "we recall that , in our models , the frc and brc are produced by g1 and g2 , respectively , where g1 follows the standard helium - enrichment parameter ( i.e. , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , while g2 is substantially enhanced in helium abundance ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "following , we have also adopted a 0.2 dex difference in metallicity between g2 and g1 , and assumed 12 and 10 gyrs for the ages of g1 and g2 respectively , with the same population ratio for the two rcs ( @xcite ; ) .",
    "we refer the reader to section  2 of for a detailed description of the rc features of our models at four different metallicity regimes in figure  [ fig1 ] . here",
    "we note from the ( @xmath11 ) cmds that the variation of the overall rc features on metallicity is similar to that in ( @xmath16 ) cmds .",
    "( f ) in ( @xmath11 ) cmd can also naturally reproduce the observed double rc feature , i.e. , @xmath10.5 mag difference with almost negligible color difference between the two rcs , as is the case in panel ( b ) in ( @xmath16 ) cmd .",
    "hereafter , we refer to these models in panels  ( b ) and ( f ) constructed at @xmath17[fe / h]@xmath18 = 0.0 as  @xmath19 \" , in order to distinguish them from the models with different input parameters presented below .    while helium abundance was fixed for g2 ( @xmath15 ) in the models in figure  [ fig1 ] , a more realistic case , in terms of the chemical evolution , would be that the helium content varies with metal abundance following a certain value of @xmath20",
    ". models in figure  [ fig2 ] were constructed with this hypothesis , adopting @xmath21 for g2 .",
    "the models for g1 are identical to those in figure  [ fig1 ] following @xmath12 .",
    "note that the reference models in panels  ( b ) and ( f ) of figure  [ fig2 ] are still identical to those in figure  [ fig1 ] . as the metallicity decreases from panels  ( b ) and",
    "( f ) to ( c ) and ( g ) , magnitude differences between the two rcs decrease drastically , and in the bottom panels , the two rcs are almost merged into one .",
    "this is due to the strong decrease in helium abundance for g2 following @xmath22 .",
    "compared to the models in figure  [ fig1 ] , where the helium abundance of g2 is fixed , the brc stars in lower panels in figure  [ fig2 ] are confined in the rc region rather than shifted to the bluer hb regime .",
    "consequently , in both cases ( i.e. , figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) , no double rc is predicted by our models in the metal - poor regime , although the hb morphologies produced by g2 are significantly different in the two cases ( see also ) .",
    "according to the chemical evolution models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , helium abundance of g2 can not increase beyond @xmath23 ; therefore , we adopted this value for g2 in the most metal - rich models in panels  ( a ) and ( e ) .",
    "accordingly , the magnitude differences between the two rcs decrease again in these panels .    in order to see the individual effects of age , helium abundance , and metallicity on the double rc feature , in figures [ fig3 ] to [ fig6 ] , we have constructed the rc models under different assumptions on these parameters for g1 and g2 . in these figures , luminosity functions are also presented on the right - side of each cmd , which were derived from @xmath110,000 stars for g1 and g2 respectively to minimize a stochastic effect . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , we first investigate the effect of age variation on g2 from the reference models . from top to bottom panels , the age for g2",
    "is decreased from 12 to 6  gyrs , while the age for g1 is fixed ( 12 gyr ) , so that the age difference between g1 and g2 ( @xmath24 ) increases from 0 to 6  gyrs . the helium abundance and metallicity are also fixed for both g1 and g2 as in the reference models . in the top panels , where the age for g2 is increased by 2  gyr from the reference models in panels  ( b ) and ( f ) , it is evident that some significant portion of brc stars are shifted to the blue hb , making the bluer mean color for the brc stars compared to the stars in frc . as such ,",
    "this could be considered as a reasonable upper limit for the age of g2 , at the adopted metallicity and helium abundance . when the age of g2 is decreased by 2@xmath254  gyrs from the reference models",
    "; however , as shown in the four bottom panels , the overall brc feature is not remarkably changed , implying an insensitivity of the brc morphology in this age range .",
    "compared to the reference models in panels  ( b ) and ( f ) , the stars in brc in the bottom panels are @xmath10.2 mag brighter and @xmath10.1 mag redder , while the age of g2 is decreased by 4  gyrs , which would give a lower limit for the age of g2 .    in figure",
    "[ fig4 ] , we examine the case where the age of g1 also varies from 14 to 6 gyr , from the top to bottom panels , while the ages for g2 are identical to those in figure  [ fig3 ] . again , panels  ( b ) and ( f ) present the reference models . in the top panels , where the age of g1 is increased by 2  gyr from the reference models ,",
    "no obvious changes are noticed in the frc morphology , while the mean luminosity of frc stars is slightly decreased ( @xmath26 0.05 mag ) in both @xmath27 and @xmath28-bands .",
    "similarly , when the age of g1 is decreased to be 2 - 6 gyr younger than that of the reference model , in the four bottom panels , no apparent changes in the color of the frc stars are detected , while their luminosity is slightly increased .",
    "consequently , in all panels , the frc stars are confined to the rc region , even if they are as old as 14 gyr , illustrating that the color of the frc is almost completely insensitive to the age variation in this high - metallicity regime .",
    "the luminosity of the frc stars is also not seriously affected by the age changes , although they become slightly brighter as age decreases . from figures  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ]",
    ", we can therefore conclude that the possible ranges for age are 12 @xmath29 6 gyr for g2 and t @xmath30 6 gyr for g1 .",
    "it should be noted that these age estimations are affected by the current uncertainty in the stellar mass - loss on the rgb .",
    "for example , if we increase the @xcite mass - loss coefficient , @xmath31 , from 0.40 to 0.50 , these ages are decreased by @xmath32  gyr .",
    "the effect of helium abundance is illustrated in figure  [ fig5 ] . in these models , helium mass fraction for g2",
    "is varied from 0.41 to 0.35 , while all the other parameters are fixed as in the reference models .",
    "the difference in helium abundance between the two rcs ( @xmath33 ) is then decreased from 0.13 to 0.07 .",
    "the most prominent feature in this figure is that the magnitude difference between the two rcs decreases substantially as @xmath33 decreases , from top to bottom panels .",
    "it is therefore clear from the luminosity functions that the observed separation in magnitude is reproduced in the top four panels , but not in the bottom four panels .",
    "the color of the brc stars , on the other hand , is less affected by the variation in helium abundance , though they are somewhat redder than the frc stars in the bottom four panels .",
    "this is because g2 in our models are more metal - rich than g1 , and thus the helium effect is mostly canceled out by the metallicity effect in this metal - rich regime ( see section  1 in ) .",
    "our simulations also suggest that , if the helium abundance for g2 is allowed to increase beyond the upper limit ( @xmath34 ) adopted in our models , the colors of the brc can be bluer than those in the top panels .",
    "consequently , the strong dependence of the double rc feature on the helium abundance of g2 clearly suggests that the @xmath33 would be within the range of @xmath35 0.10 @xmath25 0.13 , in order to reproduce the observation in our scenario .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] explores the cases where the metallicity difference between g2 and g1 ( @xmath36_{g2-g1}$ ] ) is different from our standard assumption , @xmath36_{g2-g1}$ ] = 0.2 dex . from top to bottom panels , metallicity for g2 is increased from [ fe / h ] = @xmath250.1 to + 0.5 , so that @xmath36_{g2-g1}$ ] increases from 0.0 to 0.6 dex .",
    "the other parameters are fixed as in the reference models presented in panels  ( b ) and ( f ) .",
    "the most notable feature from these models is that the color of brc considerably shifts from blue to red in both @xmath37 and @xmath38 colors as metallicity for g2 increases .",
    "it is therefore clear that the difference in color between the two rcs changes substantially with @xmath36_{g2-g1}$ ] .",
    "some decrease in luminosity of brc is also shown in panels  ( a ) , ( g ) , and ( h ) , but the magnitude difference is not seriously affected by the metallicity variation in other panels . from these , we conclude that the @xmath36_{g2-g1}$ ] would be no more than @xmath10.3 dex to reproduce the observed double rc with negligible color difference . note that this is consistent with the metallicity difference ( @xmath36 = 0.12 - 0.23 $ ]  dex ) between the two rcs inferred from the spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to see that the double rc feature in panels  ( c ) and ( g ) are qualitatively similar to that of terzan  5 , a metal - rich gc in the bulge @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a larger difference in metallicity between the two rc populations is mainly responsible for the color difference between the two rcs in this gc ( see also ) , while a larger age difference @xcite would also help to increase the color difference .    in metal - poor populations like the milky way gcs ,",
    "the hb morphology is well known to be crucially influenced by all the three parameters ( age , helium abundance , and metallicity ) explored above ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our model simulations indicate , however , that in the metal - rich regime ( [ fe / h ] @xmath39 ) , the hb stars are mostly confined in the rc region , where the effects of these parameters are either qualitatively or quantitatively different from the metal - poor cases .",
    "the luminosity of rc stars is mainly affected by helium abundance , while the rc color is primarily affected by metallicity .",
    "the effect of age is relatively small within the age range of @xmath40 . from our models",
    ", we can suggest the possible ranges of parameters required to reproduce the observed double rc feature : @xmath24 @xmath41 gyr , @xmath33 @xmath42 , and @xmath36_{g2-g1}$ ] @xmath43 dex .",
    "it should be noted , however , that these three parameters are not independent from each other but are degenerated . for example , figure  [ fig7 ] illustrates how the different combinations of parameters could reproduce the observed double rc feature . from the top to bottom panels , we increased the metallicity of g2 from [ fe / h ] = @xmath250.1 to + 0.2 , so that the metallicity difference between g2 and g1 increases from @xmath36_{g2-g1}$ ] = 0.0 to 0.3 , while the models for g1 are fixed as the reference models .",
    "we have then adjusted helium abundance and age for g2 within the parameter space suggested above , until the models in each panel similarly reproduce the double rc feature of the reference models presented in panels  ( c ) and ( g ) .",
    "note that the helium abundances of g2 are significantly ( @xmath44 ) enhanced in all panels .",
    "our models indicate , therefore , that the observed double rc feature can be naturally generated in a relatively large parameter space without the need for fine - tuning , once @xmath33 is assumed to be greater than @xmath10.10 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that our multiple population models for the double rc can not explain the longitude dependence of the rc luminosity function at high galactic latitude , @xmath2 .",
    "as shown in their figures  1 and 2 , the population in brc becomes more prominent towards the positive longitudes , while the frc population becomes more dominant in the negative longitudes .",
    "if this high - latitude field is dominated by the classical bulge population with negligible contribution from the bar component , as argued by @xcite , it would be challenging for our models to reproduce the longitude dependence .",
    "however , the stellar surface density map of @xcite clearly shows that contribution from the bar component is still important at @xmath2 .",
    "in this situation , our models can reproduce such lateral variations by a combination of the classical bulge and bar populations , as shown in figure  4 of .",
    "as illustrated by a schematic diagram in figure  [ fig8 ] , if the classical bulge component embedded in a tilted bar has a spheroidal shape , stellar density would monotonously decrease with increasing distance from the galactic center , while the density of the boxy bar would mostly depend on the distance above the galactic plane .",
    "therefore , at fixed latitude , the classical bulge to bar population ratio would reach the maximum at minor axis ( @xmath46 ) and decrease as longitude ( @xmath47 ) increases .",
    "the lower panels in figure  [ fig8 ] explain this effect at @xmath48 field .",
    "as described in figure  4 of , the rc luminosity function would be the sum of the classical bulge component with double rc and the bar component with a single rc .",
    "the double rc in the lower middle panel is then reproduced by the majority classical bulge population , while the longitude variations of the rc luminosity function , in the left and right panels , are mostly produced by the distance effect of the tilted bar , where the bar component is placed at the near ( far ) side of the bulge towards positive ( negative ) longitude .",
    "in addition , when the tilted bar is projected on the sky , the near - side of the bar at positive longitude would appear larger than the far - side component at negative longitude , as is evident from the trapezoidal density map of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .  1 ) .",
    "therefore , at the same latitude , towards the positive longitude , we would observe the bulge field at a lower distance above the plane , where the stellar density is expected to be higher , and consequently , the bar contribution would be more prominent in the positive longitude compared to the negative longitude .",
    "this effect is also included in the lower panels of figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "there are at least two possible alternative effects that can also help to explain the longitude dependence at @xmath48 fields .",
    "the first effect comes from the recent analysis of rr lyrae variable stars in the galactic bulge by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .",
    "6 ) , which shows that even the classical bulge component is elongated in the inner region with the shape of a triaxial ellipsoid following the bar structure , while the outer region shows more spherical distribution .",
    "the rr lyrae luminosity function in figure  6 of @xcite shows some hint of asymmetric distribution in the luminosity function with longitude dependence .",
    "the other effect is from the possible metallicity variation with longitude at @xmath2 . according to the metallicity map of @xcite , the mean metallicity of the bulge field at @xmath2 decreases from @xmath17[fe / h]@xmath18 @xmath490.2 to @xmath250.5 as the longitude varies from @xmath5 to @xmath50 . following this metallicity map , in figures  [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] ,",
    "we have investigated how our models are affected by this metallicity variation . in this metallicity scale of @xcite ,",
    "the double rc is best reproduced when @xmath0y/@xmath0z is adopted to be 8.0 for g2 and ages for g1 and g2 are assumed to be 11 and 9 gyrs , respectively . from the top to bottom panels , we have then decreased the metallicity by 0.1 dex with the other parameters held fixed , which would mimic the metallicity variation from @xmath5 to @xmath1@xmath50 . similarly to the metallicity dependence presented in figure  [ fig2 ] , the luminosity of brc stars decreases rapidly with decreasing metallicity , and , with the metallicity change of only @xmath0[fe / h ] = 0.2 dex , the rc split disappears as shown in panels  ( c ) and ( g ) .",
    "as discussed above , this drastic change of the brc luminosity is mostly due to the large variation of helium abundance according to the high value of @xmath0y/@xmath0z parameter .",
    "therefore , if the metallicity variation is confirmed , this effect would also help to reproduce the longitude dependence of the rc luminosity function on the negative longitude side . on the positive longitude side , the stronger peak at the brc",
    "would be explained by the projection effect discussed above .",
    "the point raised out by @xcite is therefore not necessarily a potential problem in our models , since our multiple population models can equally reproduce the observed variation of luminosity function with longitude at @xmath2 .",
    "in the multiple population paradigm , we have shown that the magnitude difference between the two rcs is mostly affected by the difference in helium abundance between g2 and g1 , and the observed double rc feature can be reproduced if @xmath51 at around solar metallicity .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] , this is obtained if the helium abundance for g2 increases with metallicity following a helium enrichment parameter @xmath21 , while g1 follows a standard value @xmath12 .",
    "chemical evolution models ( j. kim & y .- w .",
    "lee 2016 , in prep . )",
    "confirm that this trend for g2 is predicted if the gas that formed g2 was locally enriched within the protogalactic subsystems by the winds of massive stars and the winds and ejecta from low and intermediate mass asymptotic - giant - branch stars .",
    "disruption of these  @xmath52 \" in a hierarchical merging paradigm would have provided stars ( g1 and g2 ) to form a classical bulge component in the early stage of the milky way formation .",
    "one crucial condition required to obtain this result is to assume that most of the supernova ejecta could escape from these relatively less massive systems without expelling the pre - enriched gas inside ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of the strong metallicity dependence of helium yield from the winds of massive stars @xcite , helium abundance of g2 in these models would then increase rapidly with metallicity .    in the relatively metal - poor regime ( [ fe / h ] @xmath53 ) of the milky way bulge",
    ", @xcite discovered two sequences of rr lyrae stars on the period - amplitude diagram .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested a common origin for this phenomenon and the double rc observed in the metal - rich regime of the bulge .",
    "they have shown that the period - shift between these two populations of rr lyrae stars is due to a small difference in helium abundance ( @xmath0y @xmath54 ) between the first- and second - generation stars .",
    "this is as expected because , g2 , following @xmath21 , would be enhanced in helium by an order of magnitude smaller amount at this low metallicity regime compared to the metal - rich bulge where the double rc is observed .",
    "therefore , it appears quite possible that the two populations of rr lyrae stars and the double rc observed in the milky way bulge might be different manifestations of the same multiple population phenomenon in the metal - poor and metal - rich regimes respectively .",
    "it is important to note that the double rc originated from multiple population phenomenon is also observed in a metal - rich bulge gc terzan  5 @xcite . in , we estimate a helium difference of @xmath0y @xmath55 between the two rcs in terzan  5 , which is roughly consistent with the value expected from a @xmath21 trend at the metallicity of this gc ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath250.2 ; @xcite ) . at lower metallicity , @xmath0y between g2 and g1 would be smaller and consequently the magnitude separation between the two rcs would be also narrower , or the two rcs could be merged into one with a vertically extended feature ( see fig .",
    "interestingly , the rc part of the hb in ngc  6441 , another bulge gc with [ fe / h ] = @xmath250.5 @xcite , shows just this feature , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .",
    "6 ) indeed estimate a smaller @xmath0y between g2 and g1 ( @xmath0y @xmath56 ) from the rc luminosity function .",
    "as stressed in , gaia trigonometric parallax distances can soon provide a crucial test as to the origin of the double rc observed in the milky way bulge .",
    "this will in turn reveal whether a non - negligible fraction of the classical bulge population is embedded in a bar structure of the milky way or not . since the stellar populations in the classical bulge component of the milky way is considered as the nearest example of those in elliptical galaxies , this will also severely impact our understanding of stellar populations and formation of early - type galaxies .",
