    "the periodic amplitude and phase modulation observed in many rr  lyrae variables  the blazhko effect  is one of the most important , still unsolved problems in classical pulsation theory . in the last few years , thanks to extensive ground - based observation campaigns ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and satellite missions , _ corot _ @xcite and _ kepler _",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we finally obtained nearly continuous data , allowing for detailed study of the light variation associated with the blazhko cycle .",
    "one of the most exciting new findings is the period doubling phenomenon @xcite , never detected from ground - based data .",
    "it occurs at some phases of the blazhko cycle and manifests in an alternating shape of the light variation in consecutive pulsation cycles ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it was not detected in any non - modulated rr  lyrae star so far .",
    "satellite data allow to study the light curve changes over the blazhko cycle in detail .",
    "clearly , consecutive blazhko cycles are not exactly repetitive @xcite .",
    "also , the period of the blazhko modulation differs from cycle to cycle . in the frequency spectra ,",
    "the blazhko phenomenon manifests itself as equidistantly spaced multiplets around main pulsation frequency and its harmonics .",
    "triplets and quintuplets are detected in ground - based observations ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in satellite data , not only triplets and quintuplets",
    "are visible , but also tenth - order side peaks @xcite .",
    "all the newly discovered features of the blazhko effect put stringent constraints on the models proposed to explain this longstanding enigma .",
    "in fact , the two most elaborated models , the magnetic oblique rotator / pulsator model ( morp , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the non - radial resonant rotator / pulsator model ( nrrp , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are ruled out by observations for several reasons .",
    "first , strong dipole magnetic fields , necessary for the morp model to work , were not detected in rr  lyrae stars @xcite .",
    "secondly , both the morp and nrrp models predict that the observed light curve modulation should manifest through specific features in the frequency spectra .",
    "the dipole geometry of the magnetic field , considered in the morp model , leads to a quintuplet structure in the frequency spectra . a more complicated field geometry , that could possibly lead to higher order modulation components was not considered so far . within the nrrp model it is shown that the modes of @xmath1 are most easily excited , giving rise to a triplet structure in the frequency spectra .",
    "the excitation of higher order nonradial modes is less likely .",
    "in addition , due to cancellation effects , the expected amplitudes would be very low for high - order modes .",
    "to the contrary , in satellite data we clearly detect higher - order modulation components .",
    "@xcite detected modulation components up to the tenth order . in both the morp and nrrp models ,",
    "strong asymmetries in the amplitudes of the side peaks , as observed in the majority of blazhko stars , are not trivial to reproduce . considering the triplets , in about 75 per cent of the blazhko variables , the higher frequency side peak has a higher amplitude than the lower frequency side peak @xcite .",
    "third , both models propose mechanisms that imply a clockwork regularity , predicting robust modulation periods , e.g. , equal to the rotation period of the star , and repeatable blazhko cycles . neither is seen in the data .",
    "the blazhko variation can change considerably even from cycle to cycle @xcite .",
    "in several stars two modulation periods are apparent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the connection between the period of the blazhko modulation and the rotation period is highly questionable .",
    "also , in several cases consecutive blazhko cycles differ significantly , which manifests , e.g. , in systematic growth or decay of the modulation amplitude .",
    "we also mention the recent studies of the blazhko phenomenon by @xcite and @xcite . using the amplitude equation formalism ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite showed that the high order half - integer resonance , proposed by @xcite to explain the period doubling , can also cause the phase and amplitude modulation as observed in blazhko variables .",
    "the result is very exciting and a more detailed analysis and confirmation through the hydrodynamic modelling would be of great value .",
    "@xcite studied the blazhko variables in the globular cluster m5 .",
    "they showed that the blazhko stars tend to be situated on the zero - age horizontal branch and at the blue edge of the fundamental mode instability strip .",
    "they speculate that this location hints that the blazhko effect may be connected to the mode switch from the fundamental mode to the first overtone pulsation during the evolution .",
    "very recently , an idea proposed by @xcite , which connects the blazhko effect with variable magnetic stellar cycles , has gained popularity .",
    "in this idea , the blazhko modulation is connected to the cyclic strengthening and weakening of turbulent convection in the outer stellar layers , caused by the postulated transient magnetic field .",
    "the field decays cyclically and is subsequently built up anew by the turbulent / rotational dynamo .",
    "details of the process , particularly the interaction between magnetic filed , turbulent convection and pulsation were not discussed .",
    "also , numerical estimates , e.g. , on the expected strength of modulation or the necessary strength of the variable magnetic field , were not presented . for a critical analysis of the stothers idea",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "in this paper we use our pulsation hydrocodes to investigate whether variable turbulent convection may cause such a light variation as is associated with the blazhko effect .",
    "the variation of turbulent convection is put into the hydrodynamical models in an _ ad hoc _ way  interaction with the magnetic field is neglected . currently , there are no models capable of reproducing a variable magnetic field due to dynamo mechanisms and of describing its dynamical coupling with turbulent convection and highly non - linear pulsation , features we deal with in the case of rr  lyrae variables . as a consequence ,",
    "our model is strongly simplified and our results will serve for qualitative comparison with the observations .",
    "having this in mind , we state the premise of our paper . if we can reproduce the most important observational constraints , the stothers idea is certainly worth further , more detailed investigation .",
    "but if we do not succeed it needs revision .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section  [ sec.methods ]",
    "we present the details of our numerical model testing the idea proposed by stothers ( 2006 ) . in section  [ sec.results ]",
    "we describe the properties of our models and compare our results with observations , focusing on overall properties of blazhko variables and on recent _ kepler _ observations of the famous blazhko variable , rr  lyr ( kic 7198959 ) @xcite .",
    "some additional models are discussed in section  [ sec.discussion ] and conclusions are presented in section  [ sec.conclusions ] .",
    "the basic tool in our modelling is the warsaw non - linear convective pulsation hydrocode @xcite , which we briefly describe in section  [ sec.code ] .",
    "the code is slightly modified in order to model the effects of variable turbulent convection .",
    "details , as well as the modelling procedure , are outlined in section  [ sec.idea ] . in section  [ sec.cms ]",
    "we present the computed sequences of models to be analysed in this paper .      in all our computations we use pulsation codes described by @xcite .",
    "these are a static model - builder , linear non - adiabatic code and a direct time integration non - linear hydrocode . for convective energy transfer we use the @xcite convection model reformulated for the use in stellar pulsation codes .",
    "radiation is described in the diffusion approximation .",
    "the codes use a simple lagrangian mesh .    for an extensive description and details of numerical implementation",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite . here",
    "we note that the model equations contain eight order - of - unity scaling parameters that describe the turbulent convection model .",
    "these are mixing - length , @xmath2 , and parameters multiplying the turbulent fluxes and terms that drive / damp the turbulent energy , @xmath3 ( turbulent pressure ) , @xmath4 ( eddy - viscous dissipation ) , @xmath5 ( convective heat flux ) , @xmath6 ( kinetic turbulent energy flux ) , @xmath7 ( buoyant driving ) , @xmath8 ( turbulent dissipation ) and @xmath9 ( radiative cooling ) .",
    "theory provides no guidance for their values .",
    "however , some standard values are in use , which result from comparison of a static , time - independent version of the model with the standard mixing - length theory ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in practice",
    ", values of these parameters should be such that models satisfy as many observational constraints as possible .",
    "we also stress that we use the original @xcite prescription , in which essential buoyancy effects are included in convectively stable regions of the model ( negative buoyancy ) .",
    "we note that the neglect of negative buoyancy ( as is done , e.g. , in the florida - budapest code , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can lead to unphysical effects in the computed models . for an extensive discussion on the subject",
    "we refer the reader to , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the blazhko modulation is connected to the postulated cyclic strengthening and weakening of turbulent convection in the outer stellar layers , caused by a transient magnetic field .",
    "turbulent convection becomes more vigorous during the decay of the magnetic field and it is quenched as the magnetic field builds up anew .",
    "details of the underlying processes , particularly the interaction between magnetic field , turbulent convection and pulsation were not elaborated by stothers .",
    "our code neglects the effects of magnetic fields and as such is not suitable for modelling the dynamical coupling of pulsation and turbulent convection on the one hand , and the transient magnetic fields postulated by @xcite on the other hand .",
    "we only assume that the strength of the turbulent convection varies in time and do not elaborate on the physical mechanism behind such changes .",
    "the strength of turbulent convection is changed by cyclic variation of one of the @xmath2-parameters entering our model ( see section  [ sec.code ] ) .",
    "the mixing length parameter , @xmath2 , is our first choice , as it regulates the overall strength of convection and affects all the turbulent quantities entering the model ( see equations in e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we assume that the mixing length is either a sinusoidal or a triangular function of time , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.functions ] .    the initial steps in our modelling correspond to a standard hydrodynamic model computation , without modulation of the turbulent convection ( constant mixing - length ) .",
    "first , we construct a static equilibrium model .",
    "next , we compute the non - linear model . the static model is perturbed with a scaled linear velocity eigenfunction followed by time evolution of the model .",
    "the model integration is stopped , when the full - amplitude single - periodic pulsation ( the limit cycle ) is reached .",
    "then we start to modulate the turbulent convection .",
    "the non - linear model integration is restarted with the mixing - length parameter varying in time according to the chosen functional form ( see fig .  [ fig.functions ] ) .",
    "the model is integrated for several blazhko cycles .",
    "after a few initial cycles , the consecutive ones are almost indistinguishable from one another , indicating that the blazhko limit cycle is reached . then , the model integration is stopped and the resulting light variation is subjected to a detailed analysis ( section  [ sec.results ] ) .    in our computations",
    "we start to modulate the turbulent convection at the phase of maximum radius  the initial phase of modulation relative to the unperturbed mono - mode pulsation is equal to zero . to check whether the choice of the initial phase affects the results , we have computed several additional models with different initial phases : 0.25 , 0.50 and 0.75 , and starting the modulation of turbulent convection with an either increasing or decreasing mixing - length parameter . the final pulsation state ( the blazhko limit cycle ) is insensitive to the initial phase .",
    "the computed light curves are almost indistinguishable for the models with different initial phases ( the trajectories overlap in the fourier parameter plots , figs .  [ fig.papa][fig.paps ] ) .",
    "the amplitudes of the peaks in the frequency spectra ( see section  [ sec.resfa ] ) are also identical to within a fraction of a per cent .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.6800time ] we present the light variation for a typical model over slightly more than one blazhko cycle .",

    "they showed that the period doubling can occur close to the resonance centre when the resonant overtone mode is either excited or only weakly damped .",
    "@xcite also showed that , depending on the amount of dissipation in the model , the half - integer resonance leads either to single period - doubling or to the period - doubling cascade ( feigenbaum cascade ) and chaos .",
    "the period doubling phenomenon in blazhko rr  lyrae stars observed by _",

    "their convective hydrodynamic models ( with fixed convective parameters ) display period doubling , the origin of which was traced to the 9:2 resonance between the fundamental mode , and the ninth order overtone , @xmath50 . in these models ,",
    "the ninth overtone is a trapped envelope mode ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a much higher growth rate than that computed for the neighbouring overtone modes .",
    "as noted above , the weak damping of the ninth overtone favours the occurrence of period doubling . in their detailed analysis @xcite used the relaxation technique @xcite to determine the stability of the fundamental mode pulsation through the floquet stability coefficients .",
    "they showed that indeed the fundamental mode is destabilized through the @xmath50 resonance and excluded all other possible half - integer resonances .",
    "in addition , they showed that the @xmath50 resonance can lead not only to a single period doubling , but also to the period - four and period - eight limit cycles ( the feigenbaum cascade ) .",
    "our models also display period doubling , clearly visible in the light curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig.6800time ] , figs .",
    "[ fig.papa][fig.paps ] ) and in the frequency spectra ( figs .  [ fig.6800spec ] and [ fig.6800ampy ] ) .",
    "it occurs only in models of higher temperatures , with t_eff^s@xmath28 in a range 67006900 ( depending on the model sequence ) and always at phases around maximum pulsation amplitude and minimum values of the mixing length ( see right columns of figs .  [ fig.papa][fig.paps ] ) .",
    "our linear analysis confirms the findings of @xcite and @xcite . during the phases of minimum mixing length , in which period doubling occurs , the equilibrium models computed assuming corresponding , fixed values of the mixing length are very close to the @xmath50 resonance centre .",
    "we note that the mixing length has to be sufficiently small .",
    "period doubling does not occur in models with small amplitude of the mixing - length modulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig.papa ] ) .",
    "also , the ninth overtone in our models is trapped in the outer envelope and is close to being unstable .    for the period doubling to occur",
    ", the model has to be close to the resonance condition . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "if the stothers mechanism is indeed operational in blazhko variables and the convective structure of the star varies during the blazhko cycle ( as it does in our models ) , it is natural that period doubling occurs only at certain blazhko phases , at which the physical conditions are favourable .",
    "qualitatively , this is what we see in our models .",
    "favourable conditions ( proximity to the 9:2 resonance ) occur during the phases of low mixing length .",
    "these are the phases at which period doubling occurs .",
    "we note that in our models period doubling is strictly repetitive and always appears at the same phase of the blazhko cycle .",
    "in fact , at other phases the period doubling does not vanish entirely .",
    "its remnants serve as a seed for the fast growth of alternations during the next blazhko cycle .",
    "we would like to stress that turbulent convection itself does not cause period doubling , which is a resonant phenomenon and may occur in purely radiative models as well .",
    "the modulation of turbulent convection in our models just changes the structure of the outer stellar layers , bringing the instantaneous model periods close to the resonance condition .    as discussed above , the transient occurrence of the period doubling during the blazhko cycle",
    "can be naturally interpreted within the stothers model .",
    "nevertheless , a more quantitative comparison with observations reveals some discrepancies . in our models",
    "period doubling is limited to the phases of maximum pulsation amplitude .",
    "for the three _ kepler _ blazhko rr  lyrae stars it is most prominent in the phases preceding the maximum pulsation amplitudes , but not only , it is also visible close to the phases of minimum pulsation amplitude @xcite .",
    "certainly it is present in a much wider range of blazhko phases than it is in our models .    as for the frequency spectra , the amplitudes of the half integer components in all three stars observed by _ kepler _",
    "follow the same pattern .",
    "the highest peak is observed at @xmath40 followed by @xmath41 and @xmath30 .",
    "this is not what we compute in our models , as already mentioned in section  [ sec.fapc ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig.amphif ] we show the amplitudes of hif s , for models with different patterns of turbulent convection modulation ( t_eff^s@xmath28 is the same in these models , equal to 6800 ) .",
    "these are the same models as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig.ampfun ] .",
    "the highest peak is always located at @xmath30 followed by @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for the latter two peaks the amplitudes are comparable .",
    "a local maximum is visible at @xmath51 for our models of sets m6 , mt1 and mt2 .",
    "such a maximum is expected if the 9:2 resonance is indeed responsible for the period doubling .",
    "the fact that it is very weak and not present in all our models is a puzzle .",
    "the results presented so far reveal some disagreements between the computed models and the observations .",
    "the frequency analysis shows that in all our models @xmath47 is positive , so the higher frequency side peak around the fundamental mode frequency has a higher amplitude than the lower frequency side peak . in about 25 per cent of blazhko variables",
    "@xmath47 is negative .",
    "also , we can not reproduce the details of the light curve variation .",
    "in particular the anticorrelation between amplitude ratio , @xmath52 , and amplitude , @xmath53 , observed in rr  lyr through the majority of the blazhko cycle can not be reproduced . probably , the most important challenge for the stothers mechanism is a huge range of variation of the mixing length .",
    "this large variation is required to reproduce the ranges of light curve variation in strongly modulated stars like rr  lyr , as well as the pulsation period changes we observe in blazhko variables .",
    "to get an idea whether and how these difficulties may be overcome , we have computed additional sequences of models in which we vary other @xmath2-parameters of the turbulent convection model than the mixing length ( see section  [ sec.code ] ) .",
    "so far , we modulated the mixing length only , which is the natural choice , as the mixing - length parameter controls the overall strength of convection . now , as an exercise , we vary the other parameters entering the turbulent convection model .",
    "we modulate the strength of eddy - viscous dissipation ( @xmath4 ) , the strength of the source function ( @xmath7 ) , the strength of the convective heat flux ( @xmath5 ) and the strength of the turbulent dissipation ( @xmath8 , turbulent - cascade term ) . during the mixing - length modulation ,",
    "all the above terms were modulated simultaneously , as these @xmath2-parameters enter the model in pair with the mixing - length parameter ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we note that there is no physical justification behind the modulation of any particular term listed above .",
    "only a detailed 3d magnetohydrodynamical computation could clarify how a variable magnetic field could affect particular phenomena connected with the turbulent convection .",
    "unfortunately , such computations and even appropriate models do not exist currently .    in all computed model sequences ,",
    "the shape of modulation is sinusoidal , its period is 40days and the amplitude of its modulation is 50 per cent .",
    "particular @xmath2-parameters vary around the values defined in table  [ tab.convpar.nonmodulated ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.alphas ] we plot the @xmath52 vs. @xmath53 and @xmath58 vs. @xmath53 relations for models with three different initial temperatures ( t_eff^s@xmath28=6300 , 6600 and 6800 ) , just like in figs .",
    "[ fig.papa][fig.paps ] .",
    "the cross in each panel corresponds to the initial non - modulated model .",
    "thick solid trajectories correspond to the model of set m7 in which the mixing length is modulated ( default in this paper ) . as expected , the ranges of variation of the fourier parameters are smaller if we vary other @xmath2-parameters of the model than the mixing length , as in each case only one term of the convective model is modulated .",
    "we focus on @xmath52 vs. @xmath53 relation ( upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig.alphas ] ) . observed trends are not always simple ( particularly for models with t_eff^s@xmath28=6300 ) and they depend on the temperature of the model .",
    "the increase of @xmath52 with decreasing @xmath53 , as we observe in rr  lyr , can be reproduced most easily when only the strength of the convective heat flux is modulated . then , however , the range of variation of the fourier parameters is small , despite a rather huge modulation of the convective heat flux .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to propose a modulation to get a better model for rr  lyr .",
    "we have to vary more than one convective parameter to get a large range of variation of the fourier parameters . for the model with t_eff^s@xmath28=6600 one could modulate only @xmath7 , @xmath5 and @xmath8 and keep the eddy - viscous dissipation fixed .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig.alphas ] suggests that the same modulation adopted in the hotter model ( t_eff^s@xmath28=6800 ) would lead to increasing @xmath52 with increasing @xmath53 .",
    "we have also investigated whether the negative @xmath47 values can be obtained through modulating particular terms in the convective model . in fig .",
    "[ fig.qa ] we plot the @xmath47 vs. t_eff^s@xmath28 for the discussed models .",
    "negative , albeit very close to zero , values of @xmath47 are obtained only for the hottest models for which either only convective heat flux is modulated ( t_eff^s@xmath28=6600 and t_eff^s@xmath28=6800 ) or only eddy - viscous dissipation is modulated ( t_eff^s@xmath28=6800 ) .",
    "modulation of other components of the convective model always leads to positive @xmath47 .    in all our models ,",
    "the convective parameters vary around the values defined in table  [ tab.convpar.nonmodulated ] .",
    "as noted in section  [ sec.cms ] , with such values we can reproduce the observational properties of the non - blazhko rr  lyrae variables and also classical cepheids ( with smaller eddy - viscous dissipation ) . with these parameters we neglect the effects of turbulent pressure and overshooting from the convective zone .",
    "the computation of models including these effects is very time - consuming . in order to check whether the inclusion of turbulent pressure and overshooting can change our results",
    "we have computed one additional model sequence in which we set @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we adopted the same modulation parameters as for set m6 ( table  [ tab.modul ] ) i.e. , sinusoidal modulation with a period equal to 60d and an amplitude of @xmath61 per cent .",
    "the results are qualitatively the same as described in the previous sections .",
    "all models are characterised by positive values of @xmath47 . for the lower temperatures ,",
    "the light curve variation is qualitatively the same as presented in , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig.papa ] ( set m6 ) . at higher temperatures , the range of variation of the fourier parameters becomes smaller for models including turbulent pressure .",
    "consequently , for such models , an even larger amplitude of turbulent convection modulation would be necessary to reproduce the strongly modulated blazhko variables .",
    "in this paper we have investigated whether the mechanism proposed by @xcite is capable of reproducing the light curve variation and the properties of the frequency spectra we observe in rr  lyrae blazhko variables . the mechanism proposed by stothers",
    "is extremely complicated , as it assumes the coupling between a variable magnetic field and turbulent convection in high amplitude , strongly non - linear pulsators . to get a variable magnetic field",
    "a rotational / turbulent dynamo is postulated .",
    "there are no comprehensive models dealing with all these processes .",
    "even the current models to deal with turbulent convection in non - linear pulsation are rather simple , 1d , one - equation formulas .",
    "recent observational progress poses serious problems for the two most popular models to explain the blazhko effect , the magnetic oblique rotator / pulsator model and non - radial resonant rotator / pulsator model ( see introduction ) .",
    "the stothers mechanism remains as a scenario that has not been confronted with concrete challenges from observations .",
    "the variable , tangled magnetic fields postulated by @xcite can not be easily detected , making the idea hard to verify on purely observational grounds @xcite .",
    "its stochastic nature makes it attractive in the light of irregularities commonly detected in the blazhko cycles of many variables .",
    "however , this is only a general idea , not supported by any detailed calculations or modelling . to advance with the theory we proposed a simple model to check whether the variation of convective structure of the star can lead to the modulation we observe in blazhko stars .",
    "the modulation of turbulent convection is introduced into our models in an _ ad hoc _ way , neglecting the dynamical coupling with the postulated magnetic field .",
    "comparison of our models with overall properties of blazhko variables , as well as a detailed comparison with the strongly modulated prototype rr  lyr , observed by _",
    "kepler _ , reveals several discrepancies with the observations and challenges for the stothers mechanism . in our opinion",
    ", the most important objection is the required strength of the turbulent convection modulation . in order to reproduce the ranges of the light curve variation",
    "observed in strongly modulated stars like rr  lyr , we have to modulate the mixing - length by up to @xmath050 per cent on a time - scale of several tens of days .",
    "the same estimate results from the analysis of pulsation period changes ( section  [ sec.ppc ] , see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the physical reality of such strong modulation is , in our opinion , questionable , although definite claims require detailed magnetohydrodynamic modelling of the problem , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we note here that it is not possible to infer the mixing - length variation in the subatmospheric layers directly from observations . in a recent paper ,",
    "@xcite analysed the variation of fwhms ( full width at half maximum ) of spectral lines in several rr  lyrae - type stars .",
    "this parameter is a measure of the atmospheric turbulence .",
    "preston shows that maximum value of fwhm varies with the blazhko cycle .",
    "however , it is not clear if changing intensity of the atmospheric turbulence relates in any way to changes of the mixing - length in the subatmospheric layers .",
    "a strong variation of the fwhm occurs also in non - modulated rr  lyrae stars ( see preston s fig .",
    "3 ) , and , we may add , also in non - modulated hydrodynamical models with constant mixing - length ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in our opinion , the variation of the maximum fwhm reflects the behaviour of the turbulence generated by the velocity gradients in the atmosphere , rather than the possible variation of the mixing length in the deeper layers .",
    "@xcite shows that the maximum value of the fwhm is strongly correlated with the pulsation amplitude , which varies during the blazhko cycle ( his fig .",
    "the larger the pulsation amplitude , the larger the maximum value of the fwhm . on the other hand",
    ", we note that the maximum of the fwhm occurs at pulsation phases close to the minimum radius .",
    "these are the phases at which the velocity gradients in the atmosphere are the strongest .",
    "strong velocity gradients generate strong turbulence .",
    "thus , the larger the pulsation amplitude , the stronger the atmospheric velocity gradients and , consequently , the stronger the turbulence and the higher the fwhm maximum .",
    "the light variation we compute resembles that observed in blazhko variables , however , the details can not be reproduced , at least for rr  lyr .",
    "we note that our results can be used in the future for comparison with other blazhko variables for which satellite data will be soon available .",
    "this would clarify how severe the discrepancies between the model and the observed light variation are .",
    "as for the frequency spectra , we can not reproduce the asymmetry of the modulation side peaks around the main pulsation frequency . in our models ,",
    "the higher frequency side peak always has a higher amplitude , which is not the case in about a quarter of the blazhko variables @xcite .",
    "the critical analysis of the stothers idea by @xcite is also worth mentioning .",
    "he points out that the predictions by @xcite of expected period changes through the instability strip , that agree with values observed in some blazhko stars , are not correct , as they result from a misinterpretation of the linear and non - linear model periods .    in the light of our results ,",
    "the idea proposed by @xcite faces difficulties , and should be treated with caution .",
    "it needs refinement and further detailed studies in order to put it on solid physical grounds .",
    "certainly , it is worth further investigation , but other possibilities to explain the blazhko phenomenon should be explored as well .",
