    "the homogeneous electron gas is one of the fundamental models in condensed matter physics . despite its simplicity -",

    "the ground state is the fermi gas . at large @xmath7 ,",
    "the hartree - fock ground state of the electron gas is a wigner crystal , that is a state where the charge density forms a triangular crystal with exactly one electron per lattice site . in the intermediate region",
    "the hartree - fock approximation is not relevant and more sophisticated methods show that the ground state of the hamiltonian is quite different .    at small @xmath7 , the ground state of the electron gas within hartree - fock is still not known @xcite .",
    "although the ground state of the ideal fermi gas ( @xmath6 ) remains an eigenstate of the hartree - fock hamiltonian of the electron gas at any density , already wigner@xcite argued that the unpolarized fermi gas is unstable even in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "later , overhauser showed the instability of the unpolarized fermi gas with respect to spin - density waves within the hartree - fock approximation@xcite . only recently ,",
    "a hartree - fock study of the unpolarized three - dimensional electron gas was performed which proposes a more complicated structure of a ground state with spin - density waves@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we describe the results of our numerical simulations of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) , polarized electron gas at small @xmath7 , and show that the ground state is neither a fermi gas nor a wigner crystal : the charge density modulation we find corresponds to a partially occupied crystal ( the number of sites is larger than the number @xmath9 of electrons ) .",
    "we refer to this solution as a metallic phase .",
    "the charge density of this metallic phase represents a triangular lattice with reciprocal generators @xmath10 of modulus @xmath11 .",
    "this modulation is mainly carried by the wave vectors close to the fermi surface . in order to observe the metallic phase ,",
    "the number of electrons @xmath9 has to exceed a threshold ranging from @xmath12 at @xmath13 up to @xmath14 at @xmath15 . as we shall see below , the threshold increases exponentially as @xmath7 goes to 0 which may explain why this metallic phase has not been observed in previous simulations .    in this study , we obtain rigorous upper bounds on the energy of the metallic phase in the two - dimensional polarized case with a class of states mimicking the real states obtained numerically . these bounds are obtained in the limit @xmath8 where the calculation is simplified by the long range behavior of the interaction potential .",
    "however , our numerical simulations show that this metallic phase also exists for screened potential , but strictly speaking we can not prove in this case the existence of such a metallic phase in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "this bounds are easily extended to the unpolarized 2d case .",
    "then we show how this proof extends to the 3d case , whereas we have no numerical simulations indicating that this phase may correspond to the actual ground state of the 3d electron gas in hartree - fock .",
    "finally , let us point out that our bounds ( for instance eq .",
    "( [ deb ] ) ) must be considered as mathematical bounds ; they only give an understanding of the behavior of the energy of the ground state , but the actual constants involved in the expressions have to be evaluated by other means .",
