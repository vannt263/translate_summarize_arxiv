    "black hole entropy was first put on a firm footing by combining hawking s result of black hole radiation @xcite with the dynamical laws of classical black hole geometries @xcite in the manner anticipated by bekenstein @xcite . hawking s first calculation of black hole temperature",
    "@xcite invoked quantum field theory in a time - nonsymmetric spacetime that modeled a collapsing star , and the resulting time - nonsymmetric quantum state contained a net flux of radiation from the black hole @xcite .",
    "however , it was soon realized that the same temperature , and hence the same entropy , is also associated with a time - symmetric state that describes a thermal equilibrium @xcite . for a review ,",
    "see for example ref .",
    "@xcite .    a second avenue to black hole entropy has arisen via path integral methods . here ,",
    "a judiciously chosen set of thermodynamic variables is translated into geometrical boundary conditions for a gravitational path integral , and the path integral is then interpreted as a partition function in the appropriate thermodynamic ensemble .",
    "the initial impetus for the path - integral approach came in the observation @xcite that for the kerr - newman family of black holes in asymptotically flat space , a saddle - point estimate of the path integral yields a partition function that reproduces the bekenstein - hawking black hole entropy .",
    "the subject has since evolved considerably ; see for example refs .  , and the references therein .",
    "although it is empirically true that these two methods for arriving at black hole entropy have given mutually compatible results in most situations considered , it does not seem to be well understood why this should be the case .",
    "the first method is quite indirect , and it gives few hints as to the quantum gravitational degrees of freedom that presumably underlie the black hole entropy .",
    "in contrast , the path integrals of the second method arise from quantum gravity proper , but the argument is quite formal , and one is left with the challenge of justifying that the boundary conditions imposed on these integrals indeed correspond to thermodynamics as conventionally understood .",
    "one expects that the connection between the path integrals and the thermodynamics could be made precise through some appropriate operator formulation , as is the case in minkowski space finite temperature field theory @xcite .",
    "achieving such an operator formulation in quantum gravity does however not appear imminent , the recent progress in string theory @xcite notwithstanding .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the hawking effect and gravitational entropy on the eternal black hole spacetime known as the @xmath0 geon @xcite .",
    "this inextendible vacuum einstein spacetime is locally isometric to the kruskal manifold , and it in particular contains one exterior schwarzschild region . the spacetime is also both space and time orientable and globally hyperbolic , and hence free of any apparent pathologies .",
    "a novel feature is , however , that the black and white hole interior regions are not globally isometric to those of the kruskal manifold .",
    "also , there is no second exterior schwarzschild region , and the timelike killing vector of the single exterior schwarzschild region can not be extended into a globally - defined killing vector on the whole spacetime . among the continuum of constant schwarzschild time hypersurfaces in the exterior region",
    ", there is only one that can be extended into a smooth cauchy hypersurface for the whole spacetime , but probing only the exterior region provides no clue as to which of the constant schwarzschild time hypersurfaces this one actually is .",
    "these features of the @xmath0 geon lead one to ask to what extent quantum physics on this spacetime , especially in the exterior region , knows that the spacetime differs from kruskal behind the horizons .",
    "in particular , is there a hawking effect , and if yes , can an observer in the exterior region distinguish this hawking effect from that on the kruskal manifold ? also , can one attribute to the @xmath0 geon a gravitational entropy by either of the two methods mentioned above , and if yes , does this entropy agree with that for the kruskal spacetime ?",
    "answers to these questions have to start with the specification of the quantum state of the field(s ) on the @xmath0 geon .",
    "to this end , we recall that the geon can be constructed as the quotient space of the kruskal manifold under an involutive isometry @xcite . any vacuum on kruskal that is invariant under this involution",
    "therefore induces a vacuum on the geon .",
    "this is in particular the case for the hartle - hawking vacuum @xmath2 @xcite , which describes a kruskal hole in equilibrium with a thermal bath at the hawking temperature @xmath3 .",
    "we shall fix our attention to the hartle - hawking - like vacuum @xmath1 that @xmath2 induces on the geon . @xmath1",
    "can alternatively be defined ( see subsection  [ subsec : boul - hh - bogo ] ) by postulating for its feynman propagator a suitable relation with green s functions on the riemannian section of the complexified manifold , in analogy with the path - integral derivation of @xmath2 in ref .",
    "a  final definition which leads to the same vacuum state is to construct @xmath1 as the state defined by modes that are positive frequency along the horizon generators .",
    "we first construct the bogoliubov transformation between @xmath1 and the boulware vacuum  @xmath4 , which is the vacuum with respect to the timelike killing vector of the exterior schwarzschild region @xcite . for a massless scalar field , we find that @xmath1 contains boulware modes in correlated pairs , and for operators that only couple to one member of each correlated pair , the expectation values in @xmath1",
    "are given by a thermal density matrix at the usual hawking temperature .",
    "as both members of each correlated pair reside in the single exterior schwarzschild region , not every operator with support in the exterior region has this particular form ; nevertheless , we find that , far from the black hole , this _ is _ the form assumed by every operator whose support is at asymptotically late ( or early ) values of the exterior schwarzschild time .",
    "for a massive scalar field , similar statements hold for the field modes that reach the infinity . as a side result",
    ", we obtain an explicit demonstration that the restriction of @xmath1 to the exterior region is not invariant under translations in the schwarzschild time .",
    "the contrast between these results and those in the vacuum @xmath2 on the kruskal manifold @xcite is clear .",
    "@xmath2  is also a superposition of correlated pairs of boulware modes , but the members of each correlated pair in @xmath2 reside in the opposite exterior schwarzschild regions of the kruskal manifold . in  @xmath2 ,",
    "the expectation values are thermal for any operators with support in just one of the two exterior schwarzschild regions .",
    "we then consider the response of a monopole particle detector @xcite in the vacuum  @xmath1 .",
    "the detector is taken to be in the exterior schwarzschild region , and static with respect to the schwarzschild time translation killing vector of this region .",
    "the response turns out to differ from that of a similar detector in the vacuum @xmath2 on kruskal ; in particular , while the response on kruskal is static , the response on the geon is not",
    ". however , we argue that the responses on the geon and on kruskal should become identical in the limit of early or late geon schwarzschild times ( as might be inferred from the bogoliubov transformation described above ) and also in the limit of a detector at large curvature radius for any fixed geon schwarzschild time . to make the argument rigorous , it would be sufficient to verify certain technical assumptions about the falloff of the wightman function @xmath5 in  @xmath2 .",
    "we proceed to examine the complex analytic properties of the feynman propagator @xmath6 in  @xmath1 .",
    "the quotient construction of the geon from the lorentzian kruskal manifold can be analytically continued , via the formalism of ( anti)holomorphic involutions on the complexified manifolds @xcite , into a quotient construction of the riemannian section of the geon from the riemannian kruskal manifold .",
    "it follows that @xmath6 is regular on the riemannian section of the geon everywhere except at the coincidence limit .",
    "@xmath6  turns out to be , in a certain weak local sense , periodic in the riemannian schwarzschild time with period @xmath7 in each argument .",
    "however , this local periodicity is not associated with a continuous invariance under simultaneous translations of both arguments in the riemannian schwarzschild time . put differently",
    ", the riemannian section of the geon does not admit a globally - defined killing vector that would locally coincide with a generator of translations in the riemannian schwarzschild time .",
    "it is therefore not obvious what to conclude about the thermality of @xmath1 by just inspecting the symmetries of @xmath6 on the riemannian section .",
    "nevertheless , we can use the analytic properties of @xmath6 to relate the probabilities of the geon to emit and absorb a boulware particle with a given frequency , in analogy with the calculation done for the kruskal spacetime in ref.@xcite .",
    "we find that the probability for the geon to emit a particle with frequency @xmath8 at late exterior schwarzschild times is @xmath9 times the probability for the geon to absorb a particle in the same mode .",
    "this ratio of the probabilities is characteristic of a thermal spectrum at the hawking temperature @xmath10 , and it agrees with that obtained for @xmath2 in ref .  @xcite .",
    "a  difference between kruskal and the geon is , however , that the killing time translation isometry of the kruskal manifold guarantees the thermal result for @xmath2 to hold for particles at arbitrary values of the exterior schwarzschild time , while we have not been able to relax the assumption of late exterior schwarzschild times for  @xmath1 .    these results for",
    "the thermal properties of @xmath1 imply that an observer in the exterior region of the geon , at late schwarzschild times , can promote the classical first law of black hole mechanics into a first law of black hole thermodynamics exactly as for the kruskal black hole .",
    "such an observer thus finds for the thermodynamic entropy of the geon the usual kruskal value  @xmath11 , which is one quarter of the area of the geon black hole horizon at late times .",
    "if one views the geon as a dynamical black - hole spacetime , with the asymptotic far - future horizon area  @xmath12 , this is the result one might have expected on physical grounds .    on the other hand , the area - entropy relation for the geon",
    "is made subtle by the fact that the horizon area is in fact not constant along the horizon .",
    "away from the intersection of the past and future horizons , the horizon duly has topology @xmath13 and area @xmath14 , just as in kruskal .",
    "the critical surface at the intersection of the past and future horizons , however , has topology @xmath15 and area  @xmath16 . as it is precisely this critical surface that belongs to both the lorentzian and riemannian sections of the complexified manifold , and constitutes the horizon of the riemannian section",
    ", one may expect that methods utilizing the analytic structure of the geon and the riemannian section of the complexified manifold would produce for the entropy the value  @xmath17 , which is one quarter of the critical surface area , and only half of the kruskal entropy .",
    "we shall find that this is indeed the semiclassical geon entropy that emerges from the path - integral formalism , when the boundary conditions for the path integral are chosen so that the saddle point is the riemannian section of the geon .",
    "several viewpoints on this discrepancy between the thermodynamic late time entropy and the path - integral entropy are possible . at one extreme",
    ", there are reasonable grounds to suspect outright the applicability of the path - integral methods to the geon . at another extreme",
    ", the path - integral entropy might be correct but physically distinct from the subjective thermodynamic entropy seen by a late time exterior observer .",
    "for example , a physical interpretation for the path - integral entropy might be sought in the quantum statistics in the whole exterior region , rather than just in the thermodynamics at late times in the exterior region .",
    "all these results for the geon turn out to have close counterparts in the thermodynamics of an accelerated observer in a flat spacetime @xmath18 whose global properties mimic those of the geon .",
    "@xmath18  has a global timelike killing vector that defines a minkowski - like vacuum  @xmath19 , but it has only one rindler wedge , and the rindler time translations in this wedge can not be extended into globally - defined isometries of  @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19  is thus analogous to the hartle - hawking - like vacuum @xmath1 on the geon , and the rindler vacuum in the rindler wedge of @xmath18 is analogous to the boulware vacuum  @xmath4 .",
    "we find , from a bogoliubov transformation , a particle detector calculation , and the analytic properties of the feynman propagator , that the accelerated observer sees @xmath19 as a thermal bath at the rindler temperature under a restricted class of observations , and in particular in the limit of early and late rindler times , but not under all observations .",
    "note , however , that @xmath18 does not exhibit a nontrivial analogue of the large curvature radius limit of the geon .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath19 and the rindler vacuum coincide far from the acceleration horizon , just as the minkowski - vacuum and the usual rindler - vacuum coincide far from the acceleration horizon in the topologically trivial case .",
    "for a massless field , we also compute the renormalized expectation value of the stress - energy tensor in  @xmath19 .",
    "this expectation value is not invariant under rindler time translations in the rindler wedge , but the noninvariant piece turns out to vanish in the limit of early and late rindler times , as well as in the limit of large distances from the acceleration horizon .",
    "results concerning the entropy of flat spaces @xcite are again similar to those mentioned above for the geon entropy .",
    "the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "sections [ sec : flats ] and [ sec : observer - on - flats ] are devoted to the accelerated observer on  @xmath18 : section [ sec : flats ] constructs the minkowski - like vacuum and finds the renormalized expectation value of the stress - energy tensor , while section [ sec : observer - on - flats ] analyzes the bogoliubov transformation in the rindler wedge , a particle detector , and the analytic properties of the feynman propagator .",
    "section [ sec : kruskal - rpthree - defs ] is a mathematical interlude in which we describe the complexified @xmath0 geon manifold as a quotient space of the complexified kruskal manifold with respect to an holomorphic involution : this formalizes the sense in which the riemannian section of the geon can be regarded as a quotient space of the riemannian kruskal manifold .",

    "finally , section [ sec : discussion ] summarizes the results and discusses remaining issues .",
    "we work in planck units , @xmath20 .",
    "a metric with signature @xmath21 is called lorentzian , and a metric with signature @xmath22 riemannian .",
    "all scalar fields are global sections of a real line bundle over the spacetime ( _ i.e. , _ we do not consider twisted fields ) .",
    "complex conjugation is denoted by an overline .",
    "a  note on the terminology is in order .",
    "the name  hawking effect \" is sometimes reserved for particle production in a collapsing star spacetime , while the existence of a thermal equilibrium state in a spacetime with a bifurcate killing horizon is referred to as the unruh effect ; see for example ref .",
    "@xcite . in this terminology",
    ", the partial thermal properties of @xmath1 and @xmath19 might most naturally be called a generalized unruh effect , as these states are induced by genuine unruh effect states on the double cover spacetimes .",
    "however , neither the geon nor @xmath18 in fact has a bifurcate killing horizon , and our case study seems not yet to establish the larger geometrical context of the thermal effects in @xmath1 and @xmath19 sufficiently precisely to warrant an attempt at precise terminology . for simplicity , we refer to all the thermal properties as the hawking effect .",

    "thus , we see that the modes with @xmath292 are those modes that , while they have sufficient energy to reach the vicinity of  @xmath69 , propagate nonrelativistically through this region .",
    "thus , we may describe them as the wave functions of nonrelativistic particles in a gravitational field .    for large times",
    ", it is reasonable to model the corresponding wave packets by ignoring the effect of the gravitational field on the dispersion of the packet and only including this field through its effects on the center of the wave packet .",
    "that is , we model such a wave packet as the wave packet of a free nonrelativistic particle for which , instead of following a constant velocity trajectory , the center of the packet accelerates downward as described by the field . such an estimate of the large time behavior at fixed position gives an exponential decay of the wave function as the packet ` falls down the gravitational well .

    "it may well be that such an asymptotic structure does not satisfy the boundary conditions that should be imposed in the integral  ( [ partit - def ] ) .",
    "we note that this point is connected to the one above as it shows that no analytic state on the geon can be static in the exterior region .    in the context of this discussion",
    "it is interesting to recall that while the riemannian @xmath0 geon has the asymptotic structure just described , the single asymptotic region of the lorentzian @xmath0 geon is just the familiar one , that is , the asymptotic region of one kruskal exterior .",
    "thus , on the geon , the structure of the riemannian infinity is influenced not only by the structure of the single lorentzian infinity , but also by what lies behind the lorentzian horizons .",
    "another possibility is that the path - integral framework is applicable to the geon , but that the proper procedure is more subtle than the one outlined above .",
    "however , it is difficult to see what reasonable modification of the above steps would lead to a result consistent with the first law .",
    "a final possibility is that the path - integral framework is applicable to the geon , and our way of applying it is correct , but the resulting entropy is physically distinct from the subjective thermodynamic entropy associated with the observer  @xmath559 .",
    "if this is the case , the physical interpretation of the path - integral entropy might be found in the quantum statistics in the whole exterior region , rather than just the thermodynamics of late times in the exterior region . in an operator formalism",
    ", one might anticipate such an entropy to arise from tracing over the degrees of freedom that are in some sense unobservable .    from the operator point of view",
    ", the factor @xmath578 in the geon entropy might even appear reasonable . in the hartle - hawking vacuum on the kruskal manifold ,",
    "the thermal expectation values for operators in one exterior region arise from tracing over all the boulware modes in the second , unobserved exterior region . on the geon ,",
    "on the other hand , thermal expectation values in the hartle - hawking - like vacuum @xmath1 arise ( for all exterior schwarzschild times ) only for operators that do not couple to , and hence lead to a trace over , half of the boulware modes in the single exterior region .",
    "on the geon , the thermal expectation values thus involve a trace over half as many boulware modes as on the kruskal spacetime . if the statistical entropy were somehow to count modes that are traced over in these expectation values , the geon entropy indeed",
    "_ should _ be half of the kruskal entropy .",
    "an uncomfortable aspect of this argument is , however , that the entropy @xmath582 would then reflect not just the geometry of the geon and the properties of the state  @xmath1 , but also the choice of a particular class of operators in the exterior region , and it seems difficult to motivate this choice on geometrical grounds only .",
    "to end this section , we note that an analogous discussion can be carried out for the entropy associated with the rindler observer and the acceleration horizon in the flat spacetimes @xmath23 and  @xmath18 .",
    "the horizon areas are formally infinite , owing to the infinite range of the coordinate  @xmath52 , but this appears to be a minor technicality : the thermodynamic discussion of section [ sec : observer - on - flats ] adapts readily , if in part less explicitly , to counterparts of @xmath23 and @xmath18 in which @xmath52 is periodic and the horizon area finite . for the @xmath52-periodized counterpart of  @xmath23 , the path - integral approach yields for the entropy one quarter of the horizon area @xcite , while for the @xmath52-periodized counterpart of @xmath18 the path - integral entropy contains the additional factor  @xmath578 .",
    "in this paper we have investigated thermal effects on the @xmath0 geon and on a topologically analogous flat spacetime @xmath18 via a bogoliubov transformation , a particle detector , particle emission and absorption coefficients , and stress - energy tensor expectation values .",
    "we fixed our attention to the hartle - hawking - like vacuum @xmath1 on the geon and to the minkowski - like vacuum @xmath19 on  @xmath18 .",
    "we saw that , at finite times , these states are not exactly thermal unless they are sampled with a probe that couples to only half of the field modes .",
    "however , @xmath1 becomes fully thermal , at the usual hawking temperature , in the distant past and future in the far exterior schwarzschild region , and @xmath19 similarly becomes fully thermal at early and late rindler times in its rindler wedge , with the usual rindler temperature for a uniformly accelerated observer .",
    "in addition , we found some evidence for the thermality of @xmath1 at the geon spatial infinity , at arbitrary values of the exterior schwarzschild time . in the case of the geon ,",
    "some of these results rest on a set of plausible assumptions about the asymptotic behavior of the hartle - hawking green s functions @xmath579 on the kruskal manifold when @xmath92 and @xmath93 are in opposite asymptotic regions , whereas for @xmath18 the asymptotic behavior of the relevant green s function could be directly verified .",
    "we have also noted a discrepancy in the calculations for the geon entropy via late - time thermodynamic arguments and the path - integral method , and discussed some probable resolutions .",
    "one may well ask whether it was necessary to perform each of these calculations separately . as the bogoliubov transformations contain the full information about @xmath1 in terms of boulware modes , and about @xmath19 in terms of the rindler modes , the detector response and the particle emission - absorption probabilities must already be somehow encoded in the bogoliubov coefficients . understanding",
    "this encoding would be particularly useful for the geon , as one would then hope to use the expressions ( [ hhvacgeon - expanded ] ) and ( [ pac - hhvacgeon - expanded ] ) for the boulware - mode content of @xmath1 to show that the detector response does indeed become thermal in the asymptotic past or future .",
    "unfortunately , only a partial understanding of the encoding seems to be available @xcite .    what our results do strongly suggest is that an essential part of the information in the bogoliubov transformation resides in the phase correlations between the alpha and beta coefficients .",
    "we saw that the boulware - mode occupation number expectation values do not distinguish between the vacuum @xmath1 on the geon and the hartle - hawking vacuum @xmath2 on the kruskal spacetime , despite the fact that @xmath2 is static in the exterior region while @xmath1 is not .",
    "the number expectation values are determined by the absolute values of the beta coefficients , and these carry no information about the phases of the coefficients .",
    "to see explicitly where the phases enter , we observe that the geon @xmath164-modes ( [ w - modes - geon ] ) are not invariant , not even up to an overall phase , under exterior schwarzschild time translations , because such translations would turn the phases of the two terms in ( [ w - modes - geon ] ) in the opposite directions : these two terms in turn determine the alpha and beta coefficients , and thus encode into the phases of the coefficients the fact that the spacetime has a distinguished value of the exterior schwarzschild time .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath164-modes on kruskal are invariant up to an overall phase under schwarzschild time translations , because the two terms in the kruskal counterpart of ( [ w - modes - geon ] ) live in opposite exterior regions @xcite .",
    "analogous considerations hold for  @xmath18",
    ". one might speculate on whether a continued study of the these spacetimes would shed further light on the connection between bogoliubov coefficients and other measures of thermal behavior .",
    "we have characterized @xmath1 and @xmath19 as states that are induced by well - studied states on the universal covering spacetimes , as states with certain analytic properties , and as the no - particle states for modes that are positive frequency with respect to the horizon generator affine parameters .",
    "one might ask whether other , perhaps better and more geometrical , characterizations of these states could be given .",
    "one might also seek uniqueness theorems that would single out these states , in the same way that @xmath2 is selected on the kruskal manifold or the minkowski vacuum is selected on minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "for example , it might be possible to adapt the kay - wald conditions @xcite to the geon in a way in which it would suffice for the killing vector to be only local . on a converse note",
    ", one might seek to understand the late - time thermal properties of @xmath1 in the framework of general late - time behavior in dynamical black hole spacetimes .",
    "it might for example be possible to adapt the theorems of fredenhagen and haag @xcite to initial conditions compatible with the geon .",
    "our analysis of the particle emission and absorption cross sections relied in an essential way on the analytic structure of the feynman propagators in @xmath1 and  @xmath19 .",
    "although the propagators are ` periodic in imaginary time ' in a certain local sense , we saw that this local periodicity is not associated with a globally - defined @xmath345 isometry of the riemannian sections of the spacetimes .",
    "the absence of such an isometry reflects the nonstaticity of @xmath1 and  @xmath19 , and would certainly cast doubts on simply identifying the local period of the imaginary time as an inverse temperature . a  similar argument in another context",
    "was made in ref.@xcite .",
    "it should therefore be emphasized that we used the local periodicity in imaginary time only as a mathematical device in the calculation of a genuinely lorentzian observable quantity , namely , the ratio of the emission and absorption cross sections at late times .",
    "the thermal conclusion was drawn from this ratio .    for a class of operators that only couple to a judiciously - chosen half of the field modes , the expectation values in @xmath1 and @xmath19",
    "were seen to be thermal for all times , and not just in the limit of early or late times .",
    "one may ask whether detectors with such couplings could be built of matter whose underlying lagrangian has reasonable properties , including general covariance and , in the case of  @xmath18 , local lorentz invariance . while it is likely that this can be achieved with sufficiently complicated composite detectors , at least in an approximate sense over a range of the field modes ,",
    "we expect the answer to be negative for detectors that couple locally to the field at finite positions and times .    for developing a geometrical understanding of the thermal properties of our spacetimes , and for testing those conclusions that rested in part on an unverified assumption about the hartle - hawking green s function on the kruskal spacetime",
    ", it would be useful to have at hand more examples of spacetimes with similar properties .",
    "one example of interest is the spacetime @xmath583 , where @xmath24 is minkowski spacetime and the map @xmath584 reads , in the notation of subsection  [ subsec : flat - spaces ] , @xmath585 it is easily seen that the spacetime @xmath23 introduced in subsection [ subsec : flat - spaces ] is a double cover of  @xmath586 , and that @xmath586 provides another flat analogue of the @xmath0 geon , distinct from  @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , @xmath586 is in its isometry structure even more closely analogous to the geon than  @xmath18 : the two - dimensional conformal diagram for @xmath586 is as in figure  [ fig : mminus ] , but , unlike for  @xmath18 , the boundary of the diagram at @xmath62 now depicts a set in @xmath586 that is geometrically distinguished in terms of the orbits of the isometry group , in analogy with the boundary @xmath435 in the geon diagram in figure  [ fig : rpthree ] .",
    "all our results for @xmath18 adapt to  @xmath586 , with conclusions that are qualitatively similar but exhibit some quantitative differences . in particular ,",
    "as @xmath584 leaves the coordinate @xmath52 invariant , the counterpart of ( [ minusvac - expanded - pac ] ) displays no correlations between different values of  @xmath52 , and the counterpart of ( [ delta - gplus ] ) does not involve  @xmath317 .",
    "@xmath586  is globally hyperbolic , but not space orientable : its spatial topology is @xmath587 times the open mbius strip .",
    "we have focused the present paper on @xmath18 in favor of @xmath586 in order to allay the suspicion that nonorientability might have been a factor in the results .",
    "another spacetime with similar properties arises from taking the quotient of de  sitter space with respect to a @xmath581 isometry group in such a way that the spatial topology becomes  @xmath0 .",
    "explicitly , if we realize de  sitter space as the hyperboloid @xmath588 in five - dimensional minkowski space with the metric @xmath589 we can choose the nontrivial generator of the @xmath581 to act as @xmath590 one would expect similar thermal results to hold for this spacetime .",
    "it is in fact known that particle detectors in this spacetime behave in the expected way @xcite .",
    "our most intriguing result is probably the factor @xmath578 in the path - integral - approach entropy of the geon , compared with the bekenstein - hawking entropy of a kruskal hole with the same mass . while we argued that this result is mathematically understandable in view of the complexified geometry of the geon , its physical significance , or indeed physical correctness ,",
    "remains unclear .",
    "it should prove interesting to see whether this factor @xmath578 might arise within any state - counting approach to the geon entropy .",
    "we would like to thank john friedman for teaching us the geometry of the @xmath0 geon and asking whether this spacetime has a hawking temperature .",
    "we have also benefited from discussions and correspondence with numerous other colleagues , including abhay ashtekar , robert brandenberger , andrew chamblin , gary gibbons , petr hjek , gary horowitz , bei - lok hu , ted jacobson , karel kucha , nicholas phillips , alpan raval , kristin schleich , rafael sorkin , and bob wald .",
