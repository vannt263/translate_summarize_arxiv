    "<S> shape transition_. the shape transition is visible in the systematics of the excitation energies of low - lying states , for instance , the first 2@xmath3 levels of even - even nuclei : it turns out to be high ( low ) for spherical ( deformed ) shapes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a shell model ( sm ) calculation is suited , in principle , for its description , because of the high capability of calculating those energies precisely . on the other hand , since the nuclear shape is a consequence of the collective motion of many nucleons , the actual application of the sm encountered some limits in the size of the calculation .    in this letter </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ sys](a ) shows that the observed 2@xmath5 level moves up and down within the 1 - 2 mev region for @xmath0=50 - 58 , whereas it is quite low ( @xmath60.2 mev ) for @xmath7 60 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , a sharp drop by a factor of @xmath66 occurs at @xmath0=60 , which is consistent with the corresponding b(e2 ) values shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sys](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> these features have attracted much attention , also because no theoretical approach seems to have reproduced those rapid changes covering both sides . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , an abrupt change seems to occur in the structure of the ground state as a function of @xmath0 , which can be viewed as an example of the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) satisfying its general definition to be discussed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite remarkable , as the shape transition is in general rather gradual . </S>",

    "<S> figure [ sys](a ) shows excitation energies of the 2@xmath30 states of the zr isotopes , indicating that the present mcsm results reproduce quite well the observed trends . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of each calculated state is assigned as spherical , prolate , triaxial or oblate by the method of @xcite , as will be discussed later . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated 2@xmath5 state is spherical for @xmath0=52 - 56 , while it becomes prolate deformed for @xmath758 . </S>",

    "<S> [ sys](a ) in comparison to experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the sudden increase at @xmath0=60 is seen in both experiment and calculation , approaching the rotational limit , 10/3 , indicative of a rather rigid deformation . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath32 for @xmath3358 suggests a seniority - type structure which stems from the @xmath2=40 semi - magicity .        </S>",
    "<S> figure [ sys](b ) shows the properties of @xmath34 states . </S>",
    "<S> their shapes are assigned in the same way as the 2@xmath3 states . </S>",

    "<S> a spherical state appears as the @xmath35 state at @xmath0=60 instead , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sys](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we here sketch how the shape assignment is made for the mcsm eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> the mcsm eigenstate is a superposition of mcsm basis vectors projected onto the angular momentum and parity . </S>",
    "<S> each basis vector is a slater determinant , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , a direct product of superpositions over original single - particle states . </S>",
    "<S> the optimum amplitudes in such superpositions are searched based on quantum monte - carlo and variational methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for each mcsm basis vector so fixed , we can compute and diagonalize its quadrupole matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us the three axes of the ellipsoid with quadrupole momenta @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the usual way @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can then plot this mcsm basis vector as a circle on the potential energy surface ( pes ) , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tplot ] . the overlap probability of this mcsm basis vector with the eigenstate </S>",
    "<S> is indicated by the area of the circle . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one can pin down each mcsm basis vector on the pes according to its @xmath36 and @xmath37 with its importance by the area of the circle . </S>",
    "<S> note that the pes in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tplot ] is obtained by constrained hf calculation for the same sm hamiltonian , and is used for the sake of an intuitive understanding of mcsm results . </S>",
    "<S> this method , called a _ </S>",
    "<S> t - plot _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , enables us to analyze sm eigenstates from the viewpoint of intrinsic shape . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ tplot](a ) shows that the mcsm basis vectors of the @xmath38 state of @xmath39zr are concentrated in a tiny region of the spherical shape , while its @xmath40 state is composed of basis vectors of prolate shape with @xmath41350 @xmath42 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tplot](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar prolate shape dominates the @xmath43 state of @xmath13zr with slightly larger @xmath36 , as shown in fig.[tplot](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we point out the abrupt change of the ground - state property from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tplot](a ) to ( c ) , and will come back to this point later . </S>",
    "<S> the _ </S>",
    "<S> t - plot _ shows stable prolate shape for the @xmath43 state from @xmath13zr to @xmath44zr ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tplot](d ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ sys](c ) displays @xmath45 values , with small values up to @xmath0=58 and a sharp increase at @xmath0=60 , consistent with experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effective charges , @xmath46 , are used . </S>",
    "<S> because the @xmath45 value is a sensitive probe of the quadrupole deformation , the salient agreement here implies that the present mcsm calculation produces quite well the shape evolution as @xmath0 changes . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , theoretical and experimental @xmath47 values are shown for @xmath0=54 @xcite and 56 . </S>",
    "<S> the value for @xmath0=56 has been measured by experiment , discussed in the subsequent paper @xcite , as an evidence of the shape coexistence in @xmath48zr . </S>",
    "<S> the overall agreement between theory and experiment appears to be remarkable . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the @xmath49 transitions at @xmath0=54 and 56 are linked to the @xmath50 transitions in heavier isotopes , via @xmath51 transition at @xmath0=58 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ sys](d ) shows the deformation parameter @xmath15 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results of ibm @xcite , hfb @xcite and frdm @xcite calculations are included , exhibiting much more gradual changes . </S>",
    "<S> the mcsm values are obtained from @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> the systematic trends indicated by the @xmath12 level , the ratio @xmath31 , the @xmath45 value ( or @xmath15 ) , and the _ t - plot _ analysis are all consistent among themselves and in agreement with relevant experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we can , thus , identify the change between @xmath0=58 and 60 as a qpt , where in general an abrupt change should occur in the quantum structure of the ground state for a certain parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter here is nothing but the neutron number @xmath0 , and the transition occurs from a `` spherical phase '' to a `` deformed phase '' . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ sys](b ) demonstrates that the 0@xmath5 state is spherical up to @xmath0=58 , but the spherical 0@xmath3 state is pushed up to the 0@xmath52 state at @xmath0=60 , where the prolate - deformed 0@xmath3 state comes down to the ground state from the 0@xmath27 state at @xmath0=58 . </S>",
    "<S> this sharp crossing causes the present qpt . </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuities of various quantities , one of which can be assigned the order parameter , at the crossing point imply the first - order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the shape transition has been noticed in many chains of isotopes and isotones , but appears to be rather gradual in most cases , for instance , from @xmath53sm to @xmath54sm . </S>",
    "<S> the abrupt change in the zr isotopes is exceptional .    </S>",
    "<S> we comment on the relation between the qpt and the modifications of the interaction mentioned above . without them , the 2@xmath5 level is still @xmath60.2 mev at @xmath0=60 close to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sys](a ) , while at @xmath0=58 it is higher than the value in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sys](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the present qpt occurs rather insensitively to the modifications , whereas experimental data can be better reproduced by them .     </S>",

    "<S> to prolate @xmath55 states of @xmath39zr , the occupation number of the proton @xmath1 increases from 0.4 to 3.5 , while those of the @xmath56-shell orbits decrease . </S>",

    "<S> we notice also a massive ( 3.5 - 5.5 ) excitation of protons into @xmath1 in these prolate states ( see fig .  [ occ_espe](a ) ) . </S>",

    "<S> the tensor and central forces work destructively but the net effect is still lowering , though weaker than the other case . regarding the central force , the attraction between unique - parity orbits is stronger than the average due to similarities in radial wave functions , as also mentioned earlier by federman and pittel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present deformation is primarily a result of the quadrupole component of the effective interaction , and is enhanced by coherent contributions of various configurations ( jahn - teller effect @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> if single - particle energies are spread with sizable gaps in between , such coherence is disturbed and the deformation is suppressed . in the present prolate states , by distributing protons and neutrons in a favorable way partly by particle - hole excitations , espes can be optimized for stronger deformation as much as possible , thanks to the monopole properties of the central and tensor forces @xcite . </S>",
