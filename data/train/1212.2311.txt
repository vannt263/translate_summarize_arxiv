    "as the interiors of these planets are composed of the fluids containing species , such as , c , h , n , o , _ etc _ , the knowledge of physical properties of fluid hydrocarbons ( e.g. , methane , ethane and benzene ) under extreme conditions , such as equation of states ( eos ) , electrical conductivity and structure , is important in this context .",

    "we have predicted the chemical picture of the shocked ethane . in particular , the nmt for fluid ethane can be directly associated to its dissociation , which is analogous to that of molecular fluid methane .",

    "however , the peak of @xmath43 around 0.75  gets less apparent , and even vanishes at 2.8 g/@xmath5 .",
    "this may be because that ( i ) the peak of @xmath43 around 0.75  are covered by the widening of the peak around the distance between the two hydrogen atoms bonding with a carbon atom ( i.e. , more complicated alkane structures and more hydrogen molecules and atoms form ) ; and/or ( ii ) the formed hydrogen molecules partially dissociated into hydrogen atoms .",
