    "the existence of the time variability of the flux densities of some extragalactic radio sources has been established since the 1960s ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "long - standing issues , stemming mostly from observations at @xmath9  ghz , have concerned the effects of the path between the source and us  with implications for the propagation medium  and of the possible roles of variability of the source luminosity  with implications for how the sources work .",
    "more recently , as studies of structure in the cmb have become possible ( requiring observations at @xmath10  ghz ) , knowledge of variability at high frequency is becoming essential in order to remove cmb foreground contamination .",
    "we provide some illustration of the importance and causes of variability , as follows .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that refractive interstellar scintillation ( iss ) could be responsible for the intra - day variability of extragalactic radio sources at @xmath11  ghz .",
    "the basis of the mechanism is that the refractive index , @xmath12 , from an element of plasma in a cloud in the interstellar medium ( ism ) in our galaxy has the usual form @xmath13^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath14 is the observation frequency and @xmath15 is the plasma frequency , but that the variation in n in the plane of the sky across the cloud ( or indeed resulting from more than one cloud in the line of sight ) produces scintillation as the galactic ism moves with respect to both us and the radio source .",
    "the form of @xmath16 indicates that these scintillations will not be important at high enough @xmath17 .",
    "many studies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) support this notion in that they show that variability tends to increase as the galactic latitude @xmath18 of the sources decreases .",
    "further , @xcite , following a technique due to @xcite and @xcite , used two telescopes at different locations on earth to demonstrate the effect on the flux density at 4.9ghz of j1819 + 3845 of the earth moving through a scintillation pattern at the earth caused by the local ism .",
    "finally , @xcite have shown unequivocally that the motion of individual clouds in the local ism , especially as cloud edges pass the line of sight , is an important mechanism of variability at 5ghz .",
    "it is also clear that there is a component of variability that is intrinsic to some sources .",
    "the existence of this type of variability is fully supported by vlbi observations of the motion and luminosity evolution of synchrotron emitting components ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for a moving source , @xmath19 , the observed flux density , is related to @xmath20 , the flux density that would be observed at the same frequency @xmath14 in the comoving frame , by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the spectral index and @xmath23 the boost factor which depends on both the speed of the source and its angle to the line of sight .",
    "( this equation is true for optically thin sources and spherical optically thick sources . ) for a relativistically moving source , curvature in the trajectory can therefore produce flux density variation ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite have discussed the degree of variability as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "they studied 146 extragalactic compact radio sources ( a very important but not a complete sample of all sources above a given flux density ) monitored over 19791996 with the green bank interferometer at 2 and 8ghz ; major conclusions are that the iss component of variability is much stronger at 2ghz than 8ghz , and that intrinsic variability is of prime importance at high radio frequency .",
    "we now focus on variability at @xmath24 . given the foregoing work",
    ", we expect this variability to be dominated by intrinsic luminosity variability ",
    "so at @xmath24 we are dealing with the intrinsic properties of the radio sources  although the work of @xcite clearly implies that a small fraction of sources will have substantial variability caused by the iss as the edges of ism clouds pass the line of sight between us and the radio source , even at high @xmath14 .",
    "there are two large - scale surveys of extragalactic radio sources that are complete in flux density at @xmath24 and which study variability : the 9th cambridge ( 9c ) survey complete to @xmath25  25mjy at 15ghz @xcite and the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) 20-ghz pilot survey complete to @xmath25  100mjy @xcite . here",
    ", we study variability in a high - flux - density ( @xmath26 ) , very - large - area survey . as well as being complementary to the two other studies , our work has implications for forthcoming cmb work .",
    "our work follows on from @xcite ( paper i ) which employs the new extragalactic _",
    "wmap _ point source ( newps ) catalogue and is complete to 1.1jy at 33ghz . using the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 16ghz and the very small array ( vsa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 33ghz , we have carried out simultaneous observations of a subset of the sample to investigate variability over timescales ranging from a few months to @xmath27 1.5  years .",
    "all the ami data presented in this paper were obtained using the ami small array .",
    "observation and reduction strategies are as described in paper i.",
    "@xcite studied the variability of 51 faint sources from the 9c survey ( complete to @xmath25  25mjy at 15ghz ) at 15ghz on a 3-year timescale .",
    "they defined the fractional variation as @xmath28 where @xmath29 are individual flux density measurements for the same source , @xmath12 is the number of data points and @xmath30 is the mean flux density . for the 17 sources in @xcite classified as variable , the fractional variation ranges between 8.4 and 70  per  cent , with a median of 14  per  cent .",
    "@xcite studied the variability of 108 sources from the atca 20-ghz pilot survey ( complete to 100mjy at 20ghz ) at 20ghz on a 12  year timescale . for this purpose",
    ", they used follow - up observations at two epochs during 200304 .",
    "they quantified the variability in the same way as @xcite , except that they took the uncertainties in individual flux density measurements into account .",
    "they defined the unbiased variability index , @xmath31 by @xmath32 } \\mathrm { , } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 are errors on individual flux density measurements .",
    "this expression follows @xcite , who make it clear that the value of @xmath34 must be the same for each of the observations of a particular source . for all sources",
    ", @xcite obtained a median value of @xmath31 at 20ghz of 6.9 per cent .",
    "table  [ tab : var_index_sadler ] shows their distribution of @xmath31 .",
    "good knowledge of the uncertainties in flux density measurements is crucial for the study of variability .",
    "great care was put into determining these before taking them into account in quantifying the variability ( see paper i ) . because the vsa is not equatorially mounted , the linear polarisation measured with the vsa changes as a function of parallactic angle . however",
    ", we almost entirely overcome this difficulty by observing the sources at very similar has in different observing runs .",
    "we also note that , if polarisation were playing an important role , we would have expected to see greater scatter in the measured flux densities for each source within a single observing run .",
    "moreover , in general the _ wmap_-detected point sources are not strongly polarised : for the sources detected in the _ wmap _ 5-year maps , @xcite have measured a mean polarisation at 33ghz of just 2.2 per cent , although we have not determined whether there is a relation between polarisation and variability .",
    "we therefore do not expect polarisation to be an important factor in the variability observed with the vsa ."
