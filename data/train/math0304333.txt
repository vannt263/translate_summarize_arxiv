    "the single deepest fact he discovered was that quasiregular mappings are branched coverings ( as defined above ) .",
    "it is instructive to outline the main steps in the proof for this remarkable assertion , which akin to riemann s result exerts significant topological information from purely analytic data . for the details ,",

    "the branch set of a quasiregular mapping is a somewhat enigmatic object in dimensions @xmath34",
    ". it can be very complicated , containing for example many wild cantor sets of classical geometric topology [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .",
    "there is currently no theory available that would explain or describe the geometry of allowable branch sets , cf .",
    "problems * 2 * and * 4 * in section 7 .    in the next three sections , we shall discuss the problem of finding bi - lipschitz parametrizations for metric spaces .",
    "it will become clear only later how this problem is related to the branch set .",
    "-5 mm    a homeomorphism @xmath0 between metric spaces is _ bi - lipschitz _ if there exists a constant @xmath35 such that @xmath36 for each pair of points @xmath37 .",
    "it appears to be a difficult problem to decide when a given a metric space @xmath4 can be covered by open sets each of which is bi - lipschitz homeomorphic to an open set in @xmath38 , @xmath9 .",
    "if this is the case , let us say , for brevity and with a slight abuse of language , that @xmath4 is _ locally bi - lipschitz equivalent to _ @xmath38 .",
    "now a separable metrizable space is a lipschitz manifold ( in the sense of charts ) if and only if it admits a metric , compatible with the given topology , that makes the space locally bi - lipschitz equivalent to @xmath38 [ 22 ] .",
    "the problem here is different from characterizing lipschitz manifolds among topological spaces , for the metric is given first , cf .",
    "[ 8 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] .    to get a grasp of the difficulty of the problem , consider the following example",
    ": _ there exist finite @xmath39-dimensional polyhedra that are homeomorphic to the standard @xmath39-sphere @xmath40 , but not locally bi - lipschitz equivalent to @xmath41 . _",
    "this observation of siebenmann and sullivan [ 38 ] is based on a deep result of edwards [ 9 ] , which asserts that the double suspension @xmath42 of a @xmath43-dimensional homology sphere @xmath44 , with nontrivial fundamental group , is homeomorphic to the standard sphere @xmath45 .",
    "( see also [ 6 ] . )",
    "one can think of @xmath46 as a join @xmath47 , and it is easy to check that the complement of the _ suspension circle _ @xmath48 in @xmath4 is not simply connected .",
    "consequently , every homeomorphism @xmath49 must transfer @xmath48 to a closed curve @xmath50 whose complement in @xmath45 is not simply connected . a general position argument and fubini s theorem",
    "imply that , in this case , the hausdorff dimension of @xmath51 must be at least 3 .",
    "hence @xmath1 can not be lipschitz .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 can not be hlder continuous with any exponent greater than @xmath52",
    ". it is not known what other obstructions there are for a homeomorphism @xmath53 , cf . [ 16 , questions 1214 ] .",
    "see [ 33 ] and [ 37 ] for surveys on parametrization and related topics .",
    "-5 mm    what are the obvious necessary conditions that a given metric space @xmath4 must satisfy , if it were to be locally bi - lipschitz equivalent to @xmath54 , @xmath9 ? clearly",
    ", @xmath4 must be an @xmath22-manifold .",
    "next , bi - lipschitz mappings preserve hausdorff measure in a quantitative manner , so in particular @xmath4 must be @xmath22-_rectifiable _ in the sense of geometric measure theory ; moreover , locally the hausdorff @xmath22-measure should assign to each ball of radius @xmath55 in @xmath4 a mass comparable to @xmath56 .",
    "let us say that @xmath4 is _ metrically @xmath22-dimensional _ if it satisfies these geometric measure theoretic requirements .",
    "it is not difficult to find examples of metrically @xmath22-dimensional manifolds that are not locally bi - lipschitz equivalent to @xmath54 .",
    "the measure theory allows for cusps and folds that are not tolerated by bi - lipschitz parametrizations .",
    "further geometric constraints are necessary ; but , unlike in the case of the measure theoretic conditions , it is not obvious what these constraints should be .",
    "a convenient choice is that of _ local linear contractibility _ :",
    "locally each metric ball in @xmath4 can be contracted to a point inside a ball with the same center but radius multiplied by a fixed factor . for analytic implications of this condition . ]    still , a metrically @xmath22-dimensional and locally linearly contractible metric @xmath22-manifold need not be locally bi - lipschitz equivalent to @xmath54 .",
    "the double suspension of a homology 3-sphere with nontrivial fundamental group as described in the previous section serves as a counterexample . in 1996 ,",
    "semmes [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] exhibited examples to the same effect in all dimensions @xmath34 , and recently laakso [ 21 ] crushed the last hope that the above conditions might characterize at least @xmath57-dimensional metric manifolds that are locally bi - lipschitz equivalent to @xmath58 . however , unlike the examples of edwards and semmes , laakso s metric space can not be embedded bi - lipschitzly in any finite dimensional euclidean space .",
    "thus the following problem remains open :    let @xmath4 be a topological surface inside some @xmath59 with the inherited metric .",
    "assume that @xmath4 is metrically 2-dimensional and locally linearly contractible .",
    "is @xmath4 then locally by - lipschitz equivalent to @xmath58 ?    in conclusion , perhaps excepting the dimension @xmath23 , more necessary conditions are needed in order to characterize the spaces that are locally bi - lipschitz equivalent to @xmath38 . , [ 43 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] . ] the idea to use reshetnyak s theorem in this connection originates in two papers by sullivan [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , and is later developed in [ 17 ] . recall that in this theorem topological conclusions are drawn from purely analytic data .",
    "now imagine that such data would make sense in a space that is not _ a priori _ euclidean .",
    "then , if one could obtain a branched covering mapping into @xmath54 , _ manifold points would appear , at least outside the branch set_. we discuss the possibility to develop this idea in the next section .",
    "-5 mm    let @xmath4 be a metrically @xmath22-dimensional , linearly locally contractible @xmath22-manifold that is also a metric subspace of some @xmath59 .",
    "suppose that there exists a bi - lipschitz homeomorphism @xmath60 .",
    "then @xmath1 pulls back to @xmath4 the standard coframe of @xmath38 , providing almost everywhere defined ( essentially ) bounded differential 1-forms @xmath61 , @xmath62 . to be more precise here , by kirzsbraun s theorem , @xmath1 can be extended to a lipschitz mapping @xmath63 , and the 1-forms @xmath64 are well defined in @xmath59 as flat 1-forms of whitney .",
    "_ flat forms _ are forms with @xmath65-coefficients such that the distributional exterior differential of the form also has @xmath65-coefficients .",
    "the forms in are closed , because the fundamental relation @xmath66 holds true for lipschitz maps .    according to a theorem of whitney [ 45 , chapter ix ] , flat forms @xmath67 have a well defined trace on @xmath4 , and on the measurable tangent bundle of @xmath4 , essentially because of the rectifiability .. ] because @xmath68 has a lipschitz inverse",
    ", there exists a constant @xmath69 such that @xmath70 almost everywhere on @xmath4 , where the hodge star operator @xmath71 is determined by the chosen orientation on @xmath4 .",
    "condition was turned into a definition in [ 17 ] .",
    "we say that @xmath4 admits _ local cartan - whitney presentations _",
    "if for each point @xmath72 one can find an @xmath22-tuple of flat 1-forms @xmath73 defined in an @xmath59-neighborhood of @xmath74 such that condition is satisfied on @xmath4 near the point @xmath74 .",
    "[ hs][17 ] let @xmath75 be a metrically @xmath22-dimensional , linearly locally contractible @xmath22-manifold admitting local cartan - whitney presentations . then @xmath4 is locally bi - lipschitz equivalent to @xmath54 outside a closed set of measure zero and of topological dimension at most @xmath31 .    to prove theorem [ hs ] , fix a point @xmath72 , and let @xmath73 be a cartan - whitney presentation near @xmath74 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath76 be flat together with inequality can be seen as a quasiregularity condition for forms . , [ 40 ] , [ 15 ] .",
    "] we define a mapping @xmath77}\\rho\\ ] ] for @xmath29 sufficiently near @xmath74 , where @xmath78 $ ] is the line segment in @xmath59 from @xmath74 to @xmath29 , and claim that reshetnyak s program can be run under the stipulated conditions on @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , we show that for a sufficiently small neighborhood @xmath79 of @xmath74 in @xmath4 , the map @xmath80 given in is a branched covering which is locally bi - lipschitz outside its branch set @xmath81 , which furthermore is of measure zero and of topological dimension at most @xmath31 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath76 is not assumed to be closed , so that @xmath82 in general .    in executing reshetnyak s proof",
    ", we use recent advances of differential analysis on nonsmooth spaces [ 13 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 36 ] , as well as the theory developed simultaneously in [ 15 ] .",
    "incidentally , we avoid the use of the harnack inequality for solutions , and therefore a deeper use of equation ; this small improvement to reshetnyak s argument was found earlier in a different context in [ 12 ] .",
    "theorem [ hs ] provides bi - lipschitz coordinates for @xmath4 only on a dense open set . in general , one can not have more than that .",
    "the double suspension of a homology 3-sphere , as discussed in section 4 , can be mapped to the standard 5-sphere by a finite - to - one , piecewise linear sense - preserving map . by pulling back the standard coframe by such map ,",
    "we obtain a global cartan - whitney presentation on a space that is not locally bi - lipschitz equivalent to @xmath41 .",
    "similar examples in dimension @xmath83 were constructed in [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , by using semmes s spaces [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] . on the other hand , we have the following result :    [ unpub ] let @xmath75 be a metrically @xmath57-dimensional , linearly locally contractible @xmath57-manifold admitting local cartan - whitney presentations . then @xmath4 is locally bi - lipschitz equivalent to @xmath58 .",
    "theorem [ unpub ] is an observation of m. bonk and myself .",
    "we use theorem [ hs ] together with the observation that , in dimension @xmath23 , the branch set consists of isolated points , which can be resolved .",
    "the resolution follows from the measurable riemann mapping theorem together with the recent work by bonk and kleiner [ 4 ] .",
    "while theorem [ unpub ] presents a characterization of surfaces in euclidean space that admit local bi - lipschitz coordinates , we do not know whether the stipulation about the existence of local cartan - whitney presentations is really necessary ( compare problem 1 and the discussion preceding it ) .",
    "for dimensions @xmath34 , it would be interesting to know when there is no branching in the map . in [ 17 ] , we ask if this be the case when the flat forms @xmath67 of the cartan - whitney presentation belong to a sobolev space @xmath84 on @xmath4 .",
    "the relevant example here is the map @xmath85 , in the cylindrical coordinates of @xmath38 , which pulls back the standard coframe to a frame that lies in the sobolev space @xmath86 for each @xmath87 .",
    "indeed , it was shown in [ 11 ] that in @xmath38 every ( cartan - whitney ) pullback frame in @xmath84 must come from a locally injective mapping .",
    "-5 mm    in his 1978 icm address , visl [ 44 ] asked whether the branch set of a @xmath88-smooth quasiregular mapping is empty if @xmath34 .",
    "it was known that @xmath89-smooth quasiregular mappings have no branching when @xmath34 .",
    "the proof in [ ri , p. 12 ] of this fact uses quasiregularity in a rather minimal way . in this light , the following recent result may appear surprising :        [ tarkka][1 ] given @xmath34 and @xmath10 , there exist @xmath93 and @xmath94 such that the branch set of every @xmath14-quasiregular mapping in a domain in @xmath38 has hausdorff dimension at most @xmath95 , and that every @xmath96-smooth @xmath14-quasiregular mapping in a domain in @xmath38 is a local homeomorphism .",
    "the second assertion in theorem [ tarkka ] follows from the first , by way of sard - type techniques .",
    "the first assertion was known earlier in a local form where @xmath87 was dependent on the local degree [ 31 ] .",
    "our improvement uses [ 31 ] together with the work [ 30 ] by rickman and srebro .",
    "the methods in [ 1 ] fall short in showing the sharpness of theorem [ tarkka ] in dimensions @xmath97 in two technical aspects .",
    "first , we would need to construct a quasiconformal homeomorphism of @xmath38 to itself that is uniformly expanding on a codimension two affine subspace ; moreover , such a map needs to be smooth outside this subspace . in @xmath98 , it is easier to construct a mapping with expanding behavior on a line ; moreover , every quasiconformal homeomorphism in dimension three can be smoothened ( with bounds ) outside a given closed set [ 19 ] .        by suspending a covering map @xmath99 , where @xmath44 is as in section 4 , and using edwards",
    "s theorem , one finds that there exists a branched covering @xmath100 that branches exactly on @xmath101 .",
    "it is not known whether there exists a quasiregular mapping @xmath100 with similar branch set .",
    "if no such map existed , we would have an interesting implication to a seemingly unrelated parametrization problem ; it would follow that no double suspension of a homology 3-sphere with nontrivial fundamental group admits a _ quasisymmetric _ homeomorphism onto the standard 5-sphere , cf .",
    "[ 38 ] , [ 16 , question 12 ] .    by work of bonk and kleiner [ 4 ] ,",
    "the bi - lipschitz parametrization problem in dimension @xmath23 is equivalent to an analytic problem of characterizing , up to a bounded factor , the jacobian determinants of quasiconformal mappings in @xmath102 .",
    "an affirmative answer to problem 1 in section 5 would give an affirmative answer to the following problem .",
    "an @xmath103-_weight _ is a nonnegative locally integrable function whose mean - value over each ball is comparable to its essential infimum over the ball .",
    "see [ 7 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 16 ] for further discussion of this and related problems .      branched coverings constructed by using the double suspension are obvious candidates for such mappings . in [ 15 ,",

    "the example is based on a geometric decomposition space arising from _ bing s double _ [ 34 ] .",
    "we close this article by commenting on the lack of direct proofs for some fundamental properties of quasiregular mappings related to branching .",
