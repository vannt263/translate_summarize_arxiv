    "under suitable conditions , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) @xcite furnishes an approximation to the statistical response of a dynamical system to a deterministic external perturbation via statistical correlations of the unperturbed dynamics .",
    "the fdt offers more insight into statistical properties of dynamical processes near equilibrium in various scientific applications @xcite . in the past",
    "works @xcite , a computational framework predicting the average response of both deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems to a small deterministic external perturbation was developed and extensively studied .    in the current work ,",
    "we develop the fluctuation - response theory and numerically test the computational framework of the response of statistical averages to a stochastic external perturbation , for both the deterministic and stochastic unperturbed dynamics . for the deterministic unperturbed dynamics , our set - up is similar to the one used in  @xcite , however , the resulting formula we arrive at is different from the one in  @xcite , on which we will comment below . for the stochastic unperturbed dynamics , we consider two different types of perturbations : first , where the existing stochastic term is perturbed , and , second , when a new , statistically independent , stochastic term is introduced .",
    "we test the computational framework of the stochastic response on the lorenz 96 system  @xcite , which we used as a test - bed nonlinear chaotic system with forcing and dissipation for various purposes in the past  @xcite .    before going into the details , here",
    "we start by explaining the basic idea of the average response and how it can be expressed via the statistical properties of the underlying unperturbed dynamical system , and also what problems one runs into while considering what otherwise seems to be a rather simple dynamical set - up .",
    "we start by considering a system of ordinary differential equations of the form @xmath0 where  @xmath1 is a scalar time variable , @xmath2 is an @xmath3-dimensional vector in the euclidean space  @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is a smooth vector field .",
    "observe that the solution @xmath2 can be specified in the form of a semigroup  @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the initial condition .",
    "we assume that any solution  @xmath9 of   is attracted , as @xmath10 , to a compact set  @xmath11 , on which it possesses a unique invariant ergodic measure  @xmath12 .",
    "we will say that @xmath13 is the global attractor of  . here",
    "we assume that the system in   is chaotic and mixing , that is , it has positive first lyapunov exponent and decaying time autocorrelation functions .    let  @xmath14 be a twice - differentiable function on  @xmath4 , then we denote its @xmath12-average as @xmath15 observe that even though  @xmath16 changes with time @xmath1 , its @xmath12-average @xmath17 is fixed in @xmath1 , due to the fact that @xmath12 is invariant on @xmath13 under @xmath6 , @xmath18      consider the situation where the average @xmath19 is computed across a statistical ensemble of solutions of  , which is distributed according to the invariant measure @xmath12 above .",
    "as we already pointed out , this average @xmath20 is constant in time .",
    "however , assume that , at @xmath21 , an external perturbation ( that is , a stochastic modification of the right - hand side ) is introduced into  . clearly , since the right - hand side is different , the measure @xmath12 is no longer invariant for the new , modified dynamics . because of that , the statistical average @xmath19 with respect to @xmath12 becomes time - dependent for the perturbed dynamics .",
    "here we do not assume that @xmath12 is necessarily the sinai - ruelle - bowen measure  @xcite as the finite time response to an external perturbation does not require it ; an srb measure is , however , necessary for the infinite time response to be differentiable with respect to a deterministic external perturbation  @xcite .    the difference between the new time - dependent ensemble average of @xmath22 and its previous stationary ( for the unperturbed dynamics ) value is then called the `` response '' : @xmath23 observe that above the average is taken not only with respect to the statistical ensemble of solutions , but also over all possible realizations of the external stochastic perturbation .",
    "our goal here is to derive the leading order term in the response , which depends only on statistics of the unperturbed dynamical system , under the assumption that the perturbation is sufficiently small .",
    "the more obvious , `` brute force '' approach , would be to do the following :    1 .",
    "start with a point @xmath8 on @xmath13 , and emit two trajectories out of @xmath8 : the unperturbed one , given by @xmath24 , and the perturbed one , given by the corresponding solution of the perturbed system .",
    "2 .   clearly",
    ", both trajectories , perturbed and unperturbed , are generally nonlinear functions of elapsed time @xmath1 and initial condition @xmath8 .",
    "so , assuming that the unperturbed solution @xmath24 is `` known '' , figure out a suitable way to `` expand '' the perturbed solution around the unperturbed one in small increments , and keep only the leading order term .",
    "3 .   recall that this has to be done for every @xmath25 , so , average the above result out with respect to the invariant measure @xmath12 , and over all possible realizations of the external stochastic perturbation .",
    "provided that the leading order response from the previous item is somehow expressed in terms of trajectories of the unperturbed system , the @xmath12-average can be replaced with the long - term time average , with help of birkhoff s theorem  @xcite .    with the exception of averaging across realizations of stochastic perturbations ,",
    "this is what was previously done for the deterministic perturbations of chaotic and stochastic dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "it is a long and cumbersome way of deriving the response , and the result involves the ( computationally expensive ) tangent map @xmath26 , given by @xmath27 the situation is further complicated by the fact that , for chaotic dynamical systems , @xmath26 grows exponentially fast in @xmath1 , which causes a numerical instability for moderate and long response times .",
    "thus , this approach can only be practically used for rather short response times ( although it is usually quite precise , provided that the response time is sufficiently short  @xcite ) .      another way to compute the average response is to employ the concept of the probability density @xmath28 of a statistical ensemble distribution .",
    "the key idea here is to use that fact that , while @xmath2 is governed by nonlinear dynamics , the partial differential equation for @xmath28 ( called the forward kolmogorov equation  @xcite , and also the fokker - planck equation  @xcite ) is linear . in particular , for the deterministic dynamical system in  , the forward kolmogorov equation for @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the differentiation operator with respect to the vector - argument of the function it acts upon . above ,",
    "the dot - product of @xmath30 with a vector - function @xmath31 refers to @xmath32 with the usual summation convention . observe that in order for the solution @xmath28 of   to remain a probability density ,",
    "its integral over @xmath4 must remain equal to 1 ( which , together with the non - negativity of @xmath28 , implies that @xmath28 must vanish at infinity ) , even if @xmath28 itself changes with time .",
    "indeed , one can verify that the integral of @xmath28 over @xmath4 is preserved by  , which is necessary for @xmath28 to remain a probability density .",
    "the kolmogorov equation above is an extremely useful tool for working with the statistical properties of the system in , since it describes the statistical distribution of the system in a direct fashion .",
    "unfortunately , it can not be used directly to compute the response of the deterministic system in  , for the following reason .",
    "since , as stated earlier , any solution of   attracts to @xmath13 as @xmath1 becomes infinite , it would be natural to think that , in the limit as @xmath10 , @xmath28 becomes the density of the ergodic invariant measure @xmath12 on @xmath13 .",
    "however , here lies the fundamental `` incompatibility '' of the kolmogorov equation in  , and the limiting dynamics of   on its global attractor @xmath13 : for many applied dynamical systems , especially those with dissipation and forcing @xcite , the invariant measure @xmath12 on @xmath13 is not differentiable in @xmath8 ( it is also said that it is not continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath13 ) .",
    "in this situation , the ( non - stationary ) solution @xmath33 of   contracts exponentially rapidly along certain directions of the phase space ( while appropriately expanding transversally , so that its integral over @xmath4 remains 1 ) , becoming singular in the infinite time limit .",
    "observe that above we considered arguably the most simple setup for a dynamical system , which describes a wide class of applied problems .",
    "yet , we can not make use of the kolmogorov equation   to statistically describe dynamics near the attractor of the system in  , which is necessary for understanding of how the system responds to an external perturbation .",
    "therefore , in order to be able to use the kolmogorov equation in  , we must be willing to consider a suitable modification of  , which renders its invariant measure @xmath12 continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath4 .",
    "arguably , the simplest such modification is achieved via a stochastic noise added into the otherwise deterministic dynamical system in  .",
    "here we are going to consider a stochastic modification of  , achieved via introducing an additional noise term via a wiener process @xmath34 of dimension @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a smooth @xmath38 matrix . for convenience , here we interpret the resulting integral of the solution @xmath39 in the sense of it  @xcite . the forward kolmogorov equation for the differential equation in",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath40 where `` @xmath41 '' denotes the frobenius product of two matrices , so that @xmath42 to ensure the smoothness of solutions of  , here we follow  @xcite and assume that both @xmath43 and @xmath44 have bounded derivatives of all orders , and that the matrix product @xmath45 is uniformly positive definite in @xmath4 .",
    "the latter automatically means that the columns of @xmath44 span @xmath4 for any @xmath46 , implying @xmath47 .",
    "additionally , we will assume that there is a unique smooth stationary probability density @xmath48 which sets the right - hand side of   to zero .",
    "observe that the solution @xmath2 of   can not be represented by a @xmath1-semigroup like in  , since @xmath34 depends on @xmath1 explicitly .",
    "however , instead a similar representation can be done for the kolmogorov equation in   with help of the transitional probability density @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath50 denote the solution of  , for which the initial condition at @xmath21 is the delta - function @xmath51 . then , assuming that at time @xmath1 the solution is @xmath33 , its extension @xmath52 for @xmath53 can be expressed as a convolution with @xmath49 as follows : @xmath54 now , let @xmath48 denote the stationary smooth probability density of  , such that @xmath55 and , therefore , @xmath56 then , the statistically average value of a function @xmath14 is given by @xmath57 where we assume that @xmath14 is such that the integral above is finite .",
    "as before , if a statistical ensemble of solutions @xmath2 of   is distributed according to @xmath48 , then the ensemble average of @xmath22 is constant in time , even though each individual solution in such an ensemble is in general not stationary .      in what is to follow ,",
    "we arrange the presentation in the reverse order ( relative to what was presented above ) , due to the fact that , as was mentioned previously , it turns out to be easier to start with a stochastic differential equation of the form in   and derive the leading order response via the kolmogorov equation  , which we do in section  [ sec : stochastic_dynamics ] .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : deterministic_dynamics ] we return to the deterministic unperturbed dynamics , and derive the response formula in the `` brute force '' fashion , sketched above . in section  [ sec : equivalence ] we show that , if one formally replaces the invariant measure @xmath12 of the deterministic system in   with a smooth density approximation , then the response formulas for the deterministic and stochastic unperturbed dynamics become equivalent . in section",
    "[ sec : quasi - gaussian ] we derive simplified response formulas for both the deterministic and stochastic unperturbed dynamics under the assumption that the probability density of the unperturbed state is gaussian , as was previously done in  @xcite for deterministic perturbations . in section  [ sec : computational_experiments ] we present the numerical experiments with both the deterministic and stochastically forced lorenz 96 models to verify the computed response formulas .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] summarizes the results of the work .",
    "we start by considering the response of the stochastic dynamics in  , as due to the fact that the invariant state @xmath48 of the unperturbed dynamics in   is a smooth stationary solution of the kolmogorov equation in  , it is in fact much easier technically to derive the corresponding leading order response formula ( as opposed to the situation with a deterministic unperturbed dynamics ) . here",
    "we will consider two different types of perturbation : first , when the existing stochastic matrix is perturbed , and , second , when a new , statistically independent stochastic perturbation is added .",
    "first , we are going to assume that the already present in   stochastic diffusion matrix @xmath58 is perturbed by a small time - dependent term starting at @xmath21 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a small constant parameter to signify that the perturbation is small , @xmath61 is a matrix of the same dimension and smoothness properties as @xmath44 , and @xmath62 is a bounded , piecewise continuous and square - integrable function , which is zero for negative values of @xmath1 .",
    "then , the corresponding perturbed kolmogorov equation is obtained from   by replacing @xmath44 with @xmath63 : @xmath64 we assume that the solution @xmath65 of the perturbed kolmogorov equation above depends smoothly on @xmath66 for sufficiently small @xmath66 , and admits the expansion @xmath67 where @xmath48 is the stationary solution of the unperturbed kolmogorov equation , while the expansion terms @xmath68 , @xmath69 are independent on @xmath66 and have zero initial conditions .",
    "we seek the perturbed solution in the leading order of @xmath66 , which leads directly to @xmath70 one can verify directly that the solution for @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is defined in  .",
    "the response of @xmath22 in the leading order of @xmath66 is thus given by @xmath74 with @xmath75 at this point , we use the definition of @xmath73 in   to obtain @xmath76 in terms of the time - correlation function  @xcite @xmath77 with @xmath78 above , the division by @xmath48 is allowed since it is the solution to an elliptic equation which vanishes at infinity , and thus is never zero for finite @xmath79 .    for the practical computation of the time correlation function in  , we use the birkhoff - khinchin theorem  @xcite and replace the spatial integrals in   with the time average along a long - term trajectory as @xmath80 which results , after substituting the expression for @xmath81 , in @xmath82 the long - term trajectory @xmath83 above",
    "is computed via a numerical simulation of  , from an arbitrary initial condition .      here",
    "we assume that a new small stochastic term is added to  , @xmath84 where the wiener process @xmath85 is independent of @xmath34 . in order to derive the corresponding kolmogorov equation ,",
    "we rewrite the above equation in the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 the corresponding perturbed kolmogorov equation is , obviously , given by @xmath88 further observing that @xmath89 we arrive at @xmath90 observe that there is no first - order term in @xmath66 , so we can expand @xmath65 near @xmath48 in even powers of @xmath66 as @xmath91 where , as before , @xmath92 for @xmath69 are independent of @xmath66 and have zero initial condition , and similarly obtain the equation for @xmath93 as @xmath94 again , one can verify that @xmath93 is given by @xmath95 the response of @xmath22 in the leading order of @xmath66 ( which is now @xmath96 ) is thus given by @xmath97 with @xmath98 following the same steps as above for @xmath76 , we express @xmath99 via the time average as @xmath100 observe that in this case the response is quadratic in @xmath101 ( which is unlike the previous case , where the existing diffusion matrix was perturbed ) .",
    "now , we consider a small external stochastic perturbation of the deterministic system in   of the form @xmath102 where the perturbation term has the same properties as in the previous section , while , for the purposes of the derivation , we additionally require @xmath43 to be uniformly lipschitz in @xmath4  @xcite to ensure the existence of solutions to   ( recall that the unperturbed system back in   does not necessarily require it for global existence ) . here , however , we can not use an expansion of kolmogorov equation near the stationary unperturbed state , since this state may not necessarily be continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "instead , we will have to employ the differentiability of the resulting stochastic flow with respect to the perturbation  @xcite .",
    "we denote the solution to the perturbed system in   by @xmath103 , and rewrite in the integral form as @xmath104 where the stochastic integral is computed in the sense of it .",

    "therefore , we further need to average the result above over the invariant measure @xmath12 of the unperturbed system . the result is , after discarding the higher - order terms ,    @xmath132    @xmath133{\\mathrm{d}}\\mu({\\boldsymbol}x).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]",
    "while the response formula in   is rather complicated for a practical use , one can actually show that the response operator @xmath134 in   can be written in a more concise way : @xmath135 indeed , observe that , first ,    @xmath136    @xmath137    where the combination of the frobenius and outer product for matrices denotes @xmath138_{ij}=a_{kl}b_{ki}c_{lj}.\\ ] ] next , differentiating   with respect to @xmath8 yields @xmath139 duhamel s principle then yields @xmath140 combining the results , we obtain @xmath141 which leads to the above claim .",
    "it is interesting that a different response formula was obtained in  @xcite for a stochastic perturbation of a deterministic dynamics .",
    "the derivation in  @xcite was also different : instead , a stochastic perturbation was used directly in the second - order response formula for deterministic perturbations  @xcite , which was further scaled by a factor of one - half .",
    "as we mentioned above , generally one can not assume that the invariant measure of the deterministic dynamics of the form   possesses a density , since most often the compact set on which the solution of   lives has a complicated structure . however , let us assume that there exists a smooth probability density @xmath142 , such that @xmath143 is a suitable , in an appropriate for our purposes sense , approximation for the invariant measure @xmath144 .",
    "under such a hypothetical assumption , one writes   in the form @xmath145 now that @xmath12 is replaced by the density @xmath146 , one can integrate the above expression by parts , obtaining @xmath147 replacing the measure averages with the time averages with help of birkhoff s theorem , we obtain the same formula as in  : @xmath148 in other words , under the assumption of a differentiable approximation to the invariant state , the time - averaged response formula for the deterministic unperturbed dynamics is identical to the response formula for the stochastic dynamics in  , where the external stochastic perturbation is statistically independent to the unperturbed noise term .    below we will see that this approach allows to obtain a sensible approximation to the response operator even in a situation where the unperturbed dynamics is purely deterministic , similar to what was observed for the deterministic perturbations in  @xcite .",
    "observe that the response formulas for the stochastic unperturbed dynamics in and   are not computable directly , since the equilibrium density @xmath146 of   is not generally known explicitly .",
    "it is , theoretically , possible to compute the response in   by computing the tangent map @xmath26 in parallel with @xmath2 ( for more details , see @xcite ) and using   expressed as a time - lagged autocorrelation function over the time - series average .",
    "however , the latter option is very expensive from the computational standpoint , and , for a chaotic unperturbed dynamical system , it will only remain computationally stable for short response times .    instead , we are going to use a simplified method to compute the response , called the quasi - gaussian fdt ( qg - fdt ) approximation  @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the qg - fdt approximation is that @xmath146 in  , and   is replaced with its gaussian approximation , which has the same mean state and covariance matrix as does @xmath146 .",
    "for that , first observe that   and   ( which is identical to  ) can be written as    @xmath149    @xmath150    now , let us denote the mean state of @xmath146 as @xmath151 , and its covariance matrix as @xmath152 :    @xmath153    @xmath154    then , the gaussian approximation @xmath155 for @xmath146 is given by the explicit formula @xmath156 which results in    [ eq : gauss_app ] @xmath157 @xmath158    the approximations above are then inserted directly into   and  , resulting in explicit time - lagged autocorrelation functions , computed along the long - term time series of solutions of the unperturbed system in  .",
    "observe that the autocorrelations in   and  , computed via the gaussian approximations in  , simplify somewhat further if the matrices @xmath44 and @xmath159 are constant , as only one term out of the three remains in such a case .",
    "in this section we investigate the validity of the qg - fdt response formulas in   and   for both the deterministic and stochastic unperturbed dynamics . for the test - bed dynamical system ,",
    "we choose the well - known lorenz 96 model .",
    "the test system used to study the new method of stochastic parameterization here is the rescaled lorenz 96 system with stochastic forcing . without the stochastic forcing ,",
    "it was previously used in @xcite to study the deterministic reduced model parameterization , as well as the average response to deterministic external perturbations .",

    "the parameters @xmath167 and @xmath168 are the statistical mean and the standard deviation , respectively , for the corresponding unrescaled lorenz 96 model @xcite @xmath169 with the same periodic boundary conditions . the rescaling above ensures that , in the absence of the stochastic forcing ( that is , @xmath170 ) the lorenz 96 model in has zero mean state and unit standard deviation , and that the time scale of evolution of its solution is roughly the same for different values of @xmath171 . in the current work , we test the response theory , developed above , for two values of @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 , and two values of @xmath164 , @xmath174 and @xmath170 , with the latter corresponding to the purely deterministic unperturbed dynamics . as in the original paper  @xcite , we set @xmath175 .",

    "nonetheless , below we demonstrate via the numerical simulations that , for the chosen parameters of the system , numerical solutions exist for a long enough time to allow the reliable time - averaging for the response computation .",
    "the computational settings for the numerical simulations were chosen as follows :    * forward integration scheme : runge - kutta 4th order for the deterministic part of the time step , forward euler for the stochastic part of the time step ; * time discretization step : @xmath176 ; * time averaging window : @xmath177200000 time units ; * spin - up time window ( time skipped between the initial condition and the beginning of the time averaging window ) : @xmath17810000 time units ; * initial condition : each initial state @xmath179 , @xmath161 , is generated at random using normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pdfs_corrs ] we show the histograms of the probability density functions ( pdfs ) , computed by the standard bin - counting , as well as the simplest time - lag autocorrelation functions of the solution with itself , the latter computed numerically as @xmath180 where @xmath181 denotes one of the @xmath3 variables of  .",
    "obviously , due to the translational invariance of  , both the pdfs and correlation functions are identical across different variables .",
    "observe that the pdfs look close to gaussian , and the time autocorrelation functions decay rather rapidly within the first five units of time .",
    "there are two reasons why we need to check the decay of the time autocorrelation functions : first , we need to ensure that the time averaging window @xmath182 is much longer than the decay time scale of @xmath183 for the adequate statistical averaging ; and , second , we need to estimate the time scale of development of the response , since it is directly connected to the time scale of the autocorrelation functions according to   and  .",

    "however , for longer response times the errors appear to grow faster than in any of the previously considered cases .    just as for the deterministic unperturbed dynamics above , here we can also observe the large discrepancy between the two directly measured responses for different perturbation magnitudes , which develops at @xmath188 .",
    "this is likely the manifestation of statistical undersampling mentioned above , since the size of the statistical ensemble is unchanged even though an additional independent stochastic forcing is introduced into the dynamics .    in figure",

    "namely , the relative errors ( 15 - 33% ) for the initial times @xmath186 and @xmath187 are worse than those for the previously considered regime , @xmath172 , @xmath174 , likely due to the fact that the qg - fdt approximation is worse for the present regime due to stronger non - gaussianity of the unperturbed regime",
    ". however , the errors for longer times , @xmath188 and @xmath189 , are smaller than those for the regime with @xmath172 , again , likely due to the fact that the statistical undersampling does not manifest as strongly in a less chaotic regime .",
    "the collinearity correlations appear to follow the same trend as the relative errors .",
    "in this work we develop a fluctuation - response theory and test a computational algorithm for the leading order response of chaotic and stochastic dynamical systems to stochastic perturbations .",
    "the key property of this approach is that it allows to estimate the average response to an external stochastic perturbation from a certain combination of the time - lagged averages of the unperturbed system . for dynamical systems , which are already stochastic",
    ", we consider two cases : first , where the existing stochastic term is perturbed ; and , second , where a new stochastic perturbation is introduced , which correspondingly leads to different leading order average response formulas . we also show that , under appropriate assumptions , the resulting formulas for leading order response to a stochastic perturbation for the deterministic and stochastic unperturbed dynamics are equivalent . for the practical computation of the leading order response approximation",
    ", we derive the approximate quasi - gaussian response formulas , where the probability density of the unperturbed statistical state is assumed to be gaussian .",
    "we numerically investigate the validity of the quasi - gaussian response formulas for stochastic perturbations of both deterministic and stochastically forced lorenz 96 system .",
    "we find that the quasi - gaussian response formulas appear to more effective for the regimes where the unperturbed dynamics is already stochastic .",
    "additionally , for the stochastic perturbations of the deterministic lorenz 96 model , we observe what seems to be a manifestation of structural instability of the system s attractor under a stochastic perturbation ."
