    "there are long - standing , unsolved problems in the physics of solar flares .",
    "a large fraction of the magnetic energy released in a flare appears in @xmath0kev electrons that produce hard x - rays and type  iii solar radio bursts .",
    "one problem is that there is no satisfactory model for the acceleration of these electrons , which , in the older literature , was referred to as `` first phase '' acceleration @xcite and as `` bulk energization '' of electrons .",
    "runaway acceleration @xcite due to a parallel electric field [ @xmath1 seems the only viable acceleration mechanism , but there is no accepted model for how @xmath2 is set up and maintained in an acceleration region .",
    "there is also a long - standing `` number problem '' @xcite that can be expressed in various ways ; for example , the rate , @xmath3 , of precipitation of accelerated electrons inferred from hard x - ray observations implies a total of @xmath4 accelerated electrons in a flare of duration @xmath5seconds , and this exceeds the number of electrons stored in the entire flaring flux loop , estimated to be @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "another problem is that the power released in a magnetic explosion @xcite may be expressed as the product [ @xmath7 of a current and a potential , and if one assumes a current of order @xmath8a , consistent with vector magnetogram data , then to account for the energy released one requires a very large potential , @xmath9v , for which there is no direct evidence .",
    "the latter two problems are related , in that there is a single large unexplained factor [ @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , suggesting @xmath13 of order @xmath14 . to account for the factor @xmath13 ,",
    "argued that there are multiple current paths , with the current [ @xmath15 flowing up and down @xmath13 times .",
    "however , no mechanism has been proposed to account for this seemingly bizarre current pattern .",
    "the resupply of electrons is attributed to a return current @xcite .",
    "arguments related to the number problem and the return current suggest an acceleration region near ( or in ) the chromosphere , where there is an adequate supply of electrons .",
    "[ t ]        a model developed by addresses the number problem .",
    "the model is shown in figure  [ fig : fh08 ] .",
    "energy release in the corona due to magnetic reconnection generates large - scale alfvn wave pulses , which propagate within a loop to the chromosphere where they damp and accelerate electrons via a turbulent cascade .",
    "the model includes some of the essential features in an acceptable flare model .",
    "notably the energy - release site and the acceleration / dissipation region are remote from each other , with transport of energy between them via alfvn waves .",
    "the model envisaged here @xcite for energy release involves a generator ( or energy - release ) region , where reconnection allows conversion of inflowing magnetic energy into outflow in the form of plasma kinetic energy and an alfvn flux (  ) .",
    "we do not discuss the details of the generator region here , but several comments are appropriate .",
    "the energy release needs to be driven , and one possible mechanical driver is a pressure gradient , associated with collection of dense plasma near the top of the flaring loop ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , ) . in this case",
    "one needs to consider the energy and momentum associated with this dense plasma , and how it is transferred to alfvn waves .",
    "our view ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) is that the driver is the maxwell stress , and that this becomes available as reconnection allows the magnetic figuration to change to a less stressed state .",
    "the energy and momentum in the plasma then play only a minor role .",
    "we identify the power [ @xmath7 released to redirection of pre - existing current across field lines in the generator region , with the electromotive force [ @xmath16 attributed to the rate of change of the stored magnetic flux .",
    "this cross - field current [ @xmath15 is assumed to be redirected so that it flows along field lines through an acceleration region , and closes across field lines in the photosphere , and then flows back to the generator region .    a schematic diagram of the new model is shown in figure  [ fig : schematic ] . the magnetic field is assumed to be vertical , with the top of the figure in the corona , and the bottom at the photosphere .",
    "the redirection of current at the coronal generator is analogous to the redirection of current that occurs in the so - called current wedge in a magnetospheric substorm @xcite .",
    "the physics underlying this effect is related to a conducting boundary @xcite , which is the plasma wall in a laboratory context , the ionosphere in the magnetospheric context , and the photosphere in the context of a flare .",
    "specifically , when a current is driven across field lines in the body of the plasma , it closes by flowing along the field lines to a region where the conductivity allows it to close across field lines .",
    "following , it is assumed that this redirection occurs @xmath13 times in a flare , so that the potential imposed at the generator region is @xmath17 for each such redirected current path .",
    "[ t ]        in this article an analytic model for the large - scale alfvn waves is developed and used to describe various roles that alfvn waves play in such a model .",
    "the features that are new , in the solar context , are the transport of potential along field lines , and the setting up of new closed current loops . the electric field in the wave",
    "is expressed in terms of a wave potential , which also determines the field - aligned current ( fac ) density in the wave .",
    "the waves map the potential , imposed at the generator region , onto the acceleration region , where the waves are assumed to damp , converting the cross - field potential at the top of the acceleration region into a field - aligned potential within the acceleration region .",
    "figure  [ fig : pot ] illustrates the mapping of the potential and the role of the acceleration region . with the magnetic field in the vertical direction , the equipotentials shown by dashed lines are vertical above the acceleration region . the potential set up in the generator region ( above the top of the diagram ) maps along field lines to the acceleration region , where a field - aligned potential is established .",
    "the field - aligned electric field [ @xmath1 in the region extracts energy from the waves and transfers it to electrons .",
    "assuming that current is conserved in an alfvn wave ( @xmath18 ) , an alfvn wave can transfer a fac from one field line to another , and can transfer a cross - field current from one location to another , but it can not introduce any intrinsically new current .",
    "this implies that an alfvn wave that is localized to a flux tube can have no net fac : the fac in the wave must change sign across the wavefront , and include equal up and down currents .",
    "the up and down facs in the wave close across field lines in the generator region and in the photosphere , forming a closed current loop , and transferring the cross field current from one region to the other .    the general model for alfvn waves is developed in section  [ s : alfven ] , and some relevant boundary conditions are discussed in section  [ s : boundary ] . the model is applied to cylindrical and planar geometries in section  [ s : cylindrical ] .",

    "it allows one to include the plasma response to an electric field ( and its time derivative ) without assuming that its amplitude is small .",
    "any electric field , including both the inductive electric field due to the changing magnetic field , and the electric field in an alfvn wave , can be separated into components perpendicular [ @xmath19 and parallel [ @xmath20 to the background magnetic field [ @xmath21 which is assumed uniform along the @xmath22  axis .",

    "an alfvn wave incident on a boundary between between two plasmas can be partly reflected and partly transmitted .",

    "once the waves enter the acceleration region it is assumed that they are damped through some collisionless dissipation process .",
    "a self - consistency argument allows one to relate the @xmath2 involved in the acceleration to the spatial decay of the waves .",
    "the onset of a flare is attributed to the turning on of effective dissipation in the acceleration region , due to the turning on of @xmath2 .",
    "the dissipation must be anomalous : this point has been recognized by many authors @xcite .",
    "although various models for the anomalous dissipation have been explored @xcite , no consensus has emerged on the detailed microphysics involved in the creation of @xmath2 .",
    "an approach that avoids these details is based on the idea that the rate of anomalous dissipation is able to adjust to meet global requirements @xcite .",
    "all of the proposed forms of anomalous dissipation imply highly localized and transient regions of dissipation , and effective dissipation requires a statistically large number of such localized transient regions coupled together . on a macroscopic scale ,",
    "the effective rate of dissipation is determined by the statistical distribution of these localized , transient regions , and is insensitive to the details of the microphysics @xcite . in the present context",
    ", this implies that the rate of dissipation due to acceleration by @xmath27 in the acceleration region can adjust to the rate of dissipation required by the rate of magnetic energy release in the energy - release region .",
    "we assume that this adjustment is relatively slow , over many alfvn propagation times , in a precursor phase .",
    "we identify the onset of a flare as a threshold being reached where the coupling between the localized dissipation regions becomes effective , like a percolation threshold in a network system @xcite . in such a model ,",
    "the macroscopic dissipation turns on and couples to the generator region in at most a few alfvn propagation times .",
    "the power dissipated in the acceleration region can then be modeled as @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is an effective resistance , which adjusts to meet the required rate of dissipation .",
    "the development of @xmath2 implies that the frozen - in condition does not apply in the acceleration region , allowing the magnetic field lines to slip through the plasma .",
    "this was referred to as a `` fracture '' of the magnetic field by @xcite .",
    "whereas prior to the flare , the line - tying condition precludes plasma motion in response to the stress imposed in the energy - release region , once @xmath2 develops in the acceleration region , the plasma above this region can move relative to the plasma below it .",
    "this motion corresponds to the fluid motion [ @xmath108 in the alfvn waves , and is essential in allowing alfvnic transport of energy .",
    "the assumption that the potential surfaces all close within the acceleration region is an oversimplification , that ignores the requirement that a return current be set up between the acceleration region and the photosphere , or more specifically , the region of cross - field current closure . as in the application to auroral acceleration @xcite , this requires some s - shaped , as well as u - shaped potentials .",
    "once effective dissipation turns on , the rates of energy release and dissipation adjust to balance each other within a few alfvn propagation times .",
    "the foregoing arguments suggest that the global requirement on the dissipation and electron acceleration is that alfvnic flux released in the energy - generation region be completely absorbed in the acceleration region",
    ". this condition corresponds to impedance matching .",
    "suppose the dissipation is described by an effective ( anomalous ) conductivity , @xmath109 , which is averaged over the distribution of localized dissipation regions .",

    "the condition for zero reflection of an alfvn wave incident on the acceleration follows by analogy with equation ( [ aw9 ] ) : r_ref = r_eff - r_ar_eff+r_a=0 .",
    "[ perfect1 ] it follows that all of the incoming energy is dissipated completely when the effective resistance of the acceleration region adjusts such that it is equal to the alfvnic impedance .",

    "this profile changes , to @xmath139 , after passage of an alfvnic front launched by the onset of the flare .",
    "it was found that power transported increases with increasing concentration of @xmath139 towards @xmath140 ; this increase continues as the central concentration of @xmath139 increases to arbitrarily large values , compensated by a return current flowing at larger radii . in the present model ,",
    "the pre - flare fac is excluded by the assumption that the field lines are straight .",
    "this may be interpreted as assuming that the guiding magnetic field is arbitrarily strong , and that both the pre - flare fac and the fac in the alfvn waves may be treated as ( independent ) perturbations .",
    "the alfvn wave model then has the same qualitative and semi - quantitative features as in the earlier model .",
    "specifically , in the cylindrical case , the power transported by the alfvn waves increases as @xmath141 becomes increasingly concentrated towards the axis of the cylinder , where it enhances the pre - flare fac , with @xmath141 in the opposite direction to the pre - flare fac at larger radii .",
    "in particular , for the model equation ( [ rc5 ] ) both the concentration of the fac and the energy flux increase with increasing power - law index @xmath83 .",
    "the planar model equation ( [ planar8 ] ) has similar properties , with the power - law index @xmath99 the counterpart of @xmath83 in the cylindrical model .",
    "a new feature of the alfvn wave model in the solar context is the transport of potential .",
    "the alfvn waves are launched in the generator region , where the power released is due to a cross - field potential and a cross - field current : the cross - field potential in the wave matches that at the boundary of the generator region , and the fac in the wave arises from redirection of the cross - field current at the boundary of the generator region . which of these two boundary conditions dominates determines whether the generator can be approximated as constant - voltage or constant - current , which in turn depends on the ratio of the internal and external impedances .",
    "the alfvn waves transport the potential along field lines to the acceleration region .",
    "reflection of the alfvn waves from both regions modifies the potential , providing a feedback that regulates the rate of dissipation in the acceleration region and the rate of energy release in the generator region .",
    "a realistic theory requires a physical model to determine the form of the wave potential . here",
    ", simple analytical models are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition equation ( [ bc1 ] ) at the edge of the flux tube within which the alfvn waves are confined .",
    "the magnitude of the potential is not constrained by the theory , but it is implausible that the total potential available [ @xmath142v ] can be transported by a single alfvn wave .",
    "there is no evidence that @xmath143 appears across the acceleration region ; the evidence is that the potential that does appear across the acceleration region is @xmath144 , with @xmath13 of order @xmath14 .",
    "[ t ]     and cross - field current @xmath145 , below which is an energy transport region to an acceleration region with anomalous conductivity .",
    "the cross - field current is redirected along field lines to close in a conducting boundary , which is assumed to be the photosphere .",
    "following holman ( 1985 ) , the current [ @xmath15 is assumed to flow up and down multiple [ @xmath10 times , forming a picket - fence structure .",
    "the potential across the acceleration region is @xmath146 . ]",
    "the explanation for the multiplicity [ @xmath10 proposed by can be incorporated into the model .",
    "@xcite s suggestion is that there are @xmath13 pairs of up and down current channels , leading to the `` picket - fence '' model illustrated in figure  [ fig : picket ] .",
    "one requires that the potential across the acceleration region [ @xmath144 ] be of order @xmath148v for each channel , each of which has up and down currents [ @xmath149 of order @xmath145 .",
    "it is unrealistic to use cylindrical geometry to describe multiple pairs of up and down currents , which would occur in alternate concentric rings . in a planar geometry ,",
    "the pairs of up and down current are in alternate current sheets .",
    "a more realistic geometry requires an arrangement for the @xmath13 current pairs , in either cylindrical ( @xmath150 ) or cartesian ( @xmath151 ) geometry , combined with a model for each of the current pairs .",
    "a physical explanation is needed for the multiplicity [ @xmath10 of current pairs .",
    "one possibility is to consider restrictions imposed by the microphysics on the potential in the alfvn waves .",
    "if the potential is restricted to @xmath152v , then @xmath153 current channels must develop in order to provide the required total rate of energy loss .",
    "moreover , these current channels must develop simultaneously ; if they develop sequentially , the implied timescale of @xmath14 alfvn propagation times greatly exceeds the timescale of a flare .",
    "these problems are not discussed further here .",
    "how alfvn waves damp and accelerate particles effectively is an unsolved problem .",
    "some form of anomalous dissipation is required . as has long been recognized ,",
    "a requirement for a current - driven instability is a very high current density , which implies filamentation of the current into many high - current - density channels @xcite .",
    "let the current threshold for instability be @xmath154 .",
    "suppose each filament is cylindrical , and of radius @xmath155 , such that the current in each filament is @xmath156 .",
    "one requires a large number [ @xmath157 of such channels . for a specific model ,",
    "estimated @xmath158 and @xmath159meter .",
    "an unavoidable implication is that anomalous dissipation requires that the dissipation region is highly structured , involving very small scales perpendicular to the field lines .",
    "the following argument based on the alfvn wave model leads to a similar conclusion .",
    "suppose one balances the incoming poynting vector in the alfvn waves with the outgoing kinetic energy flux in accelerated electrons with a number density @xmath160 .",
    "this gives ( d^+(r)dr)^2=n_e(2m)^1/2 [ e^+(r)]^3/2 , [ sc1 ] with @xmath161 given by equation ( [ ar3 ] ) , and where @xmath162^{1/2}$ ] is the speed of the accelerated electrons .",
    "using equation ( [ ar3 ] ) , one may integrate equation ( [ sc1 ] ) to find e^+(r)=2mv_0 ^ 2(r)^4 , = _",
    "p4c , [ sc2 ] and use equation ( [ aw5 ] ) to find |j_^+|=en_ev_032(r)^2 .",
    "[ sc3 ] with @xmath163 of order @xmath164 under coronal conditions , it follows from equation ( [ sc2 ] ) that the model requires perpendicular structure in @xmath84 on a scale of a few tens of skin depths [ @xmath165 which is of the same order of magnitude as the @xmath155 estimated by by a different argument .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ sc3 ] ) that there is a high current density , sufficient to trigger anomalous conductivity , on the scale @xmath155 .",
    "the result , equation ( [ sc3 ] ) , demonstrates an inconsistency in the alfvn model , as developed here .",
    "the alfvn wave model applies on a macro scale , plausibly describing the energy and potential transport to the top of the acceleration region .",
    "effective dissipation involves micro - scale structures , and these must be taken into account within the dissipation region .",
    "the model developed here for the dissipation region can at best be regarded as applying to properties averaged over a statistically large distribution of such micro - scale structures .",
    "the long - standing `` number problem '' can be partly resolved by requiring a return current between denser regions of the solar atmosphere and the acceleration region .",
    "existing models for the return current have invoked both electrostatic and inductive effects @xcite .",
    "the alfvn wave model provides a new way of modeling the return current , in terms of alfvn waves setting up new current loops , that close across field lines in the acceleration region and in denser regions of the solar atmosphere .",
    "such a model has an important qualitative difference from these earlier models , in which the ions were neglected @xcite .",
    "neglecting the ions leads to neglecting the polarization current , so that the inductive effects propagate effectively at the speed of light .",
    "it is essential to include the polarization current , and then equation ( [ pd3 ] ) implies that inductive effects are transported along field lines by alfvn waves at the mhd speed . an alfvn wave model for an inductively driven return current is needed to show how the electrons are continuously resupplied to the acceleration region , as is necessary for both `` first phase '' electron acceleration and for auroral electron acceleration @xcite .",
    "the main point of this article is that large - amplitude alfvn waves play an important role in solar flare physics .",
    "these are not `` waves '' in the conventional sense , with a well - defined frequency and wave vector , but are specific solutions of the alfvn wave equation equation ( [ meperpt ] ) involving a cross - field wave potential [ @xmath41 ] and field aligned currents , @xmath141 , determined by the wave potential . energy transport is along field lines at the mhd speed [ @xmath135 ] as for any ( torsional ) alfvn wave . the wave potential provides the mapping of the potential imposed in the generator region onto the acceleration region .",
    "reflected alfvn waves transport the reaction ( of the acceleration region or the photosphere ) back to the generator region , providing a coupling between them .",
    "the alfvn waves set up new closed current loops , with oppositely directed facs closing across field lines at the two ends ( in the generator region and the photosphere ) .",
    "a long - standing problem with models involving particle acceleration by alfvn waves is the mechanism that allows the alfvn waves to damp and to transfer their energy to particles .",
    "the interpretation of the wave amplitude in terms of a cross - field potential provides a way of interpreting this damping without identifying the microphysics involved . within the acceleration region",
    "it is assumed that the wave amplitude , and hence the cross - field potential , decreases downwards .",
    "there is then a nonzero gradient of the potential along the field lines implying a nonzero @xmath27 .",
    "this @xmath27 accelerates the particles . in an idealized model",
    ", the alfvnic energy flux at the top of the acceleration region is converted into a kinetic - energy flux in accelerated electrons at the bottom of the acceleration region , where the wave amplitude ( potential ) is zero .",
    "the rate of dissipation can be determined by assuming that the anomalous dissipation processes adjust to maximize the power dissipated .",
    "this leads to the impedance matching condition for the effective resistance , @xmath168 , of the acceleration region .",
    "all anomalous dissipation processes involve microphysics on tiny space scales , of order one meter in the present context @xcite , and the relation between processes on micro and macro scales is treated heuristically here .",
    "this relation needs to be explained in a more detailed model .",
    "the alfvn wave model indicates how long - standing , unsolved problems related to bulk energization of electrons may be resolved .",
    "it is assumed that the acceleration results from @xmath2 in an acceleration region , along field lines above a hard x - ray source in the chromosphere .",
    "one problem is the seeming inconsistency between the large cross - field potential , of order @xmath169volts , and the energy , @xmath170 of order @xmath171ev , of the accelerated electrons .",
    "one way of resolving this @xcite is to assume that the pre - flare current flows back and forth between the generator and dissipation regions many ( @xmath153 ) times .",
    "electrons are accelerated downward in a sequence of @xmath13 jumps in potential , one jump for each instance of @xmath145 flows up through the acceleration region . the additional insight that the alfvn wave model provides is that @xmath13 current paths may be regarded as @xmath13 closed current loops set up by alfvn waves .",
    "the number problem is resolved by identifying the total rate [ @xmath172 that electrons precipitate as @xmath13 times the rate [ @xmath173 for each of these loops",
    ". however , there is no obvious explanation within the model for the value of the multiplicity [ @xmath10 .",
    "a speculation is that the microphysics in the acceleration region constrains the value of @xmath170 .",
    "there are unsolved problems related to the acceleration region @xcite .",
    "in particular , the self - consistency argument for @xmath2 , based on the damping of the waves due to energy transfer to particles by @xmath27 , is heuristic , and needs to be complemented by a specific mechanism that accounts for @xmath2 .",
    "all such mechanisms appear to involve very small scales perpendicular to the field lines , estimated to be of order one meter by .",
    "an outstanding problem is how this microphysics relates to the macroscopic model discussed in this article .",
    "the alfvn wave model developed here is highly simplified , and is applied specifically only to transport of energy between the generator and acceleration region .",
    "however , the physics involved is likely to be widely relevant to energy transport and energy release in the solar atmosphere .",
