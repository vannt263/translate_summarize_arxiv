    "enormous progress has been made in the five years since the first experiments demonstrated that charge carriers in single graphene sheets behave like massless dirac fermions .",
    "making and studying such single - atom thick carbon sheets is now routinely done using a wide variety of techniques .",
    "( for reviews , see refs .  ) .    while the allure of manipulating single monoatomic sheets has understandably attracted most of the attention in this field , from a technological , or for that matter , fundamental point of view , the properties of few - layer - graphene sheets are equally attractive .",
    "many of the methods used to make monolayer graphene , such as mechanical exfoliation of graphite , epitaxial growth from silicon carbide and chemical vapor deposition on metals , can be suitably adapted to make graphene stacks , with a controllable number of atomic layers .",
    "many of the unusual properties of the dirac hamiltonian that are used to describe monolayer graphene , such as having chiral and ambipolar carriers , survive in these multilayers , so one might expect that these sheets would have high mobility and favorable carrier transport properties . as a result ,",
    "multilayer graphene may play an important role in future electronic devices where its additional `` layer '' degree of freedom could be manipulated  @xcite to achieve desirable properties , such as the demonstrated gate - tunable band - gap in graphene bilayers .",
    "@xcite    there has been experimental and theoretical work on the optical properties of graphene multilayers , as well as some very recent theoretical predictions on the phonon - scattering in these multilayers.@xcite however , there has not been a systematic study of the low temperature transport properties of graphene multilayers . in anticipation of forthcoming experiments on these systems ,",
    "we use both analytical and numerical methods to understand carrier transport in graphene multilayers .",
    "the complication in studying multilayers is the coupling between the layers .",
    "the carrier transport in a single graphene sheet can be readily understood using the dirac hamiltonian , which is the low energy effective theory for @xmath0-orbitals located on the vertices of a carbon honeycomb lattice . for multilayers ,",
    "the additional coupling between orbitals on neighboring layers depends sensitively on many factors such as the distance between the layers and their relative orientation .",
    "for example , graphene bilayers with a twist angle between their respective primitive cells are predicted to largely act as decoupled sheets.@xcite for bernal stacking ( also called a - b stacking ) , on the other hand , half the carbon atoms in each hexagon of the top layer lie exactly over the center of a hexagon of the layer below it .",
    "the resulting strong coupling between the two layers gives a low energy effective theory with a zero - gap hyperbolic dispersion .    while height fluctuations ( or equivalently , having spatial fluctuations in the interlayer coupling strength ) , or allowing for arbitrary rotations and slips between the layers are important for some systems ( such as epitaxial graphene ) , their effects are beyond the scope of the present work.@xcite here we consider multilayers that come in families where the orientation of the upper layers is determined by symmetry considerations from the orientation of the bottom layer .",
    "this would be the case , for example , if the multilayer inherits its structure from a parent structure , as is the case in the mechanical exfoliation technique .",
    "we further restrict our multilayer analysis to the lower energy stacking sequences in which neighboring layers share only one sublattice .",
    "for example , we consider bilayer graphene that is a - b stacked , where the two layers share one sublattice , but not a - a stacked , where each carbon atom of the top layer lies exactly on top of a carbon atom of the bottom layer ( sharing both sublattices ) .",
    "the consecutive a - a stacking is energetically unfavorable,@xcite so we do not consider this stacking and its generalization in multilayer stacks . for trilayer graphene , we consider two possibilities : a - b - a stacking ( also called bernal - like ) is a bernal bilayer , with the third layer having carbon atoms located directly above the bottom layer ; and a - b - c stacking .",
    "figure [ fig : stack ] illustrates the different stacking sequences graphically . since the honeycomb lattice of a single graphene sheet comprises two interpenetrating triangular sublattices , we label the sublattices of each layer @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "when a subsequent graphene layer is placed on top of the stack , we consider the stacking orders where either the atoms of the @xmath1 or the @xmath2 sublattices are displaced along the edges of the honeycomb of this top sheet .",
    "this gives a stacking rule that implies three distinct but equivalent projections ( labeled a , b , and c ) of the three - dimensional structure s honeycomb - lattice layers onto the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane and consequently @xmath5 distinct stacking sequences for an @xmath6-layer stack .     and",
    "( b ) each added layer cycles around this stacking triangle in either the right - handed or the left - handed sense .",
    "reversals of the sense of this rotation tend to increase the number of low - energy pseudospin doublets . ]",
    "the electronic properties of multilayer graphene strongly depend on the stacking sequence .",
    "periodically stacked multilayer graphene @xcite and arbitrarily stacked multilayer graphene @xcite have been studied theoretically , demonstrating that the low - energy band structure of a graphene multilayer consists of a set of independent pseudospin doublets .",
    "it was shown that an energy gap can be induced by a perpendicular external electric field in abc - stacked multilayer graphene.@xcite furthermore , in abc stacking , electron - electron interactions play a more important role than other stacking sequences due to the appearance of relatively flat bands near the fermi level.@xcite this enhanced role of electron interactions raises the likelihood of strongly - correlated ground - states , a possibility that we ignore in our semiclassical treatment below .",
    "optical properties of multilayer graphene using absorption spectroscopy have been studied experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite showing characteristic peak positions in optical conductivity depending on the stacking sequence .",
    "transport properties of monolayer , bilayer and multilayer graphene have been studied theoretically@xcite within coherent potential approximations .",
    "these approaches capture the scattering properties of the impurity potential ( which is important for strong disorder ) , but they are often restricted to small system sizes , and do not accurately account for the disorder - induced spatial inhomogeneity of the fluctuating local carrier density .",
    "we believe this inhomogeneity dominates the transport properties of these graphene multilayers ( see discussion in ref .  ) .",
    "our main finding is that for relatively clean samples , the carrier density dependence of the multilayer conductivity follows a power - law dependence for more than two decades , a direct consequence of the effective low energy chiral decomposition . for dirty samples , the carrier density inhomogeneity induced by",
    "the disorder washes away this power - law relationship .",
    "however , the various stacking sequences give characteristically different dependence of the multilayer conductivity on carrier density . by careful comparison with experimental data ,",
    "our results could be used to identify both the number of layers and the stacking sequence of a multilayer graphene sample .",

    "the scattering of carriers between the valleys requires a momentum transfer of @xmath67 , and is strongly suppressed for coulomb impurities . for short - range scattering ,",

    "this correctly weights the relative importance of intraband and interband scattering , and therefore gives the correct qualitative carrier density dependence of the conductivity .",

    "there have been no transport experiments that could probe these higher energy bands by inducing sufficiently large carrier densities .",
