    "( [ ch ] ) @xmath15 represents an @xmath16 symmetric free energy functional with ground state in @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the mobility .",
    "although in the original work of cahn and hilliard a constant @xmath19 was proposed , it has been subsequently argued @xcite that , for scalar systems , a field - dependent mobility @xmath20 is more appropriate ; @xmath21 for temperature @xmath22 , while @xmath23 for @xmath24 . for vectorial systems",
    "it is natural to generalize eq .",
    "( [ mob ] ) , considering a mobility @xmath25    phase - ordering in presence of non - constant mobility has recently been studied with @xmath26@xcite , showing a richer behavior with respect to the usual case with constant @xmath19 . from a microscopic point of view",
    "it is easy to understand the existence of two different coarsening mechanisms in the separation of binary mixtures , which is the typical realization of a scalar conserved phase - ordering system .",
    "the first is surface diffusion , namely the diffusion of molecules along domain walls in order to minimize the interfacial energy , and is associated with a growth law of the domain size @xmath8 , with @xmath10 .",
    "the second consists in the evaporation of molecules from large curvature regions of domain interfaces and their subsequent diffusion through the other phase towards less curved interface portions .",
    "it is often called also lifshitz - slyozov or evaporation - condensation mechanism ; the growth exponent is @xmath27@xcite . since bulk diffusion is an activated process and surface diffusion is not , an interesting phenomenology occurs when the temperature is changed . for high @xmath28",
    "( but still @xmath29 ) one observes only bulk diffusion ( @xmath27 ) , which is faster than the other mechanism .",
    "when the temperature is lowered , bulk diffusion is strongly suppressed due to its activated nature ; it is therefore possible to observe a preasymptotic regime dominated by surface diffusion ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this crossover is reproduced by the continuum equations with non constant mobility@xcite , when the parameter @xmath30 is varied . at the coarse - grained level of the continuum equations ,",
    "this again can be understood by observing that while for shallow quenches ( @xmath31 ) @xmath32 remains finite in the whole system , the situation is different when deep quenches are considered .",
    "when @xmath7 the mobility vanishes within domains and suppresses bulk transport ; since @xmath33 on domain boundaries , the motion of interfaces is instead unaffected .    despite the formal analogy of eq .",
    "( [ ch ] ) for scalar and vectorial fields the underlying coarsening mechanisms are in principle different , as a consequence of the different symmetry of the ground state .",
    "however for @xmath34 one has stable localized topological defects , of which domain walls are the scalar counterpart . with constant mobility defects",
    "play in vectorial systems exactly the same role of surfaces for @xmath26 : phase - ordering proceeds for long times by reduction in their typical radius of curvature ( if they are extended ) or via mutual annihilation of defect - antidefect pairs ( for point defects ) .",
    "this analogy is however not complete : it is not clear what are in the vectorial case the coarsening mechanisms corresponding to surface and bulk diffusion ; it is not even clear that two different mechanisms must exist at all .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath35 no stable localized defects are present and the coarsening process has evidently a different nature , even if the growth exponent is the same .    in this paper",
    "we consider the phase - ordering kinetics of a vectorial field with a non constant mobility .",
    "we report results obtained numerically in @xmath6 for the case @xmath3 , as a paradigm of systems with topological defects , and the cases @xmath4 and @xmath36 , where stable defects are absent .",
    "we also study analytically the soluble large-@xmath2 model .",
    "interestingly , we find that the global picture is the same from @xmath3 up to @xmath37 , and perfectly analogous to the scalar case . more precisely ,",
    "while for @xmath38 the power growth law @xmath8 is obeyed asymptotically with @xmath10 , with @xmath7 a new value of the dynamical exponent @xmath9 is observed asymptotically , corresponding to a lower growth rate , in analogy with the case @xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath39 the @xmath9 exponent is expected to be observed preasymptotically before a crossover leads to @xmath10 .",
    "these results are found both for critical and off - critical quenches .    from these results",
    "it turns out that the similarity between ordering in scalar and vectorial systems is very strong .",
    "also for @xmath40 the dynamic exponent @xmath41 is changed by the depth of the quench in the presence of a non constant mobility .",
    "this close analogy is not limited to fields supporting topological defects but is instead valid for any number of components of the order parameter .",

    "although it has been shown @xcite that the nature of the dynamical process is different when @xmath2 is strictly infinite , the signature of this being the multiscaling symmetry obeyed by the structure factor , the global picture provided by this model is often qualitatively adequate and predicts the correct dynamical exponent @xmath41 for @xmath40 . here",
    "it will be shown that the non trivial behavior of systems with non constant mobility , which is due to the interplay between the different coarsening mechanisms , is fully reproduced by the large-@xmath2 model .",

    "these equations apply to off - critical and critical quenches ( @xmath63 ) as well ; in the latter case only one equation is required since eqs .",
    "( [ n = oolong ] ) and ( [ n = oo ] ) coincide .",

    "therefore , the asymptotic behavior is the same as for a large-@xmath2 system with constant mobility @xcite , as expected .",
    "notice the logarithmic correction with respect to the power law growth obeyed by systems with finite @xmath2 which is due to the multiscaling symmetry of @xmath77 ; the dynamical exponent @xmath10 is known to be correct for all physical vectorial systems .",

    "therefore the vanishing of the mobility in equilibrated regions slows down the dynamics and changes @xmath41 from 4 to 6 , similarly to the scalar case where one goes from the lifshitz - slyozov evaporation condensation mechanism , associated to @xmath27 , to @xmath10 .",
    "it must be noticed however that , apart from this analogy , the physics of the coarsening process is very different due to the absence of stable topological defects for @xmath35 and there is no clear indication on the nature of the transport mechanism associated with @xmath9 .",

    "our aim is to present a rather complete description of the effect of a non - constant mobility in systems with different number of components and to compare the results with what is known for @xmath26 and with the above discussed large-@xmath2 model . in order to fulfill this program",
    "we have chosen @xmath6 and @xmath3 or @xmath4 and @xmath36 so that we can analyze systems with and without stable topological defects .",
    "the numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqmot ] ) is obtained by simple iteration of the discretized equation on a 512x512 mesh , except for the off - critical @xmath3 , @xmath7 case which is computed on a 256x256 lattice .",
    "each quench is averaged over three different realizations of the initial conditions .",
    "the numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqmot ] ) is particularly delicate for @xmath39 , because in this case a small error in the calculation of @xmath81 in the bulk may give rise to a negative @xmath46 , thus producing a spurious instability .",
    "we have avoided this problem by letting @xmath82 , and tested that this does not produce any significative difference in the results .",
    "the characteristic growing length @xmath83 is obtained from the structure factor as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the first moment of @xmath86 .      in fig .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) the behavior of @xmath83 is compared in the two cases @xmath87 and @xmath7 , for critical quenches with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "has @xmath10 with good accuracy almost immediately , while for @xmath7 a convergence towards @xmath9 is observed .",
    "best fit estimates for times larger than @xmath89 yield @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath87 and @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively ; for @xmath7 , instead , one has @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the corresponding cases .",
    "we notice , by the way , the remarkable superposition of the curves with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "it is interesting to observe the evolution of the structure factor , which is shown in figs .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) , for @xmath4 , at different times for @xmath87 and @xmath7 , respectively . here",
    "one observes , immediately after the linear instability corresponding to the exponential growth of a peak at constant wave vector , the formation of a rather well developed power law decay of @xmath77 for large @xmath94 ; this tail is initially formed at very large values of @xmath94 , subsequently it moves towards lower wave vectors and then gradually disappears as time increases , being replaced by a faster ( exponential ) decay of the structure factor . as fig .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) shows the exponent of this decay is very close to @xmath95 in accordance with the existence of a generalized porod s tail , i.e. @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the porod s tail is associated with the presence of localized topological defects .",
    "the presence of such a tail in figs .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) , suggests therefore that defects are formed at early time and eventually decay so that the power law disappears asymptotically .",

    "we observe that for @xmath87 the data collapse is very good for @xmath100 , whereas it becomes progressively less accurate for increasing values of @xmath101 .",
    "this effect is probably due to the remnant of the power law tail that , for the times covered by the numerical solution , has not completely disappeared , as can be seen from fig .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) . in any case",
    "the data are consistent with the existence of the scaling property both for @xmath87 and @xmath7 . in fig .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) the scaling functions of the cases @xmath87 and @xmath7 are compared .",
    "the scaling function is obtained here as @xmath102 , @xmath103 being the longest time of our computation .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that no significative differences are observed in the scalar case between the two scaling functions , a fact that indicates the independence of the morphology of the growing phases with respect to a change of the coarsening mechanism from bulk to surface diffusion .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) shows that the same property is shared by our vectorial model .",
    "notice also that @xmath104 for small @xmath94  @xcite .",
    "we present in the following the results of the numerical simulation of the case @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) the behavior of @xmath83 is plotted versus @xmath105 in the two cases @xmath87 and @xmath7 . from this figure",
    "we conclude that a power law growth with @xmath10 or @xmath9 for @xmath87 and @xmath7 respectively , fits very well the data .",

    "the structure factors at different times for @xmath87 and @xmath7 are shown in figs .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , respectively .",
    "here one observes again the formation of the porod s tail but , differently from the cases @xmath4 and @xmath5 , this pattern is maintained asymptotically , a fact that reflects the stability of the topological defects in the late stage of the dynamics . in fig .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) the scaling plots for @xmath77 are presented .",
    "no compelling evidence can be obtained by the analysis of this figures about the possible existence of a scaling breakdown , which has been suggested with constant mobility for @xmath6 and @xmath3@xcite ; nevertheless one observes a worse data collapse with respect to the case @xmath4 and @xmath36 for large @xmath101 , both for @xmath87 and @xmath7 . for @xmath100 , on the other hand , the collapse is rather good . in fig .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) a comparison is presented between the quantity @xmath102 ( which , if scaling exists , corresponds to the scaling function ) in the cases @xmath87 and @xmath7 . here",
    "one observes a superposition of the two curves for @xmath100 . for @xmath109 , however , they become more and more distant with @xmath101 .",
    "the situation is different from the cases @xmath26 and @xmath110 where the scaling functions practically coincide in the whole range of @xmath101 values . from the observation of figs .",
    "( [ 11]),([12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) we argue that , for @xmath100 the @xmath3 model behaves very similarly to the cases @xmath26 and @xmath110 , since we find a superposition of curves at different times in the scaling plots ( [ 11 ] ) , ( [ 12 ] ) , and very similar `` scaling function '' for @xmath87 and @xmath7 .",
    "for @xmath109 , however , one observes a much worse superposition in both cases .",
    "it is not presently clear if the origin of this difference is due to preasymptotic effects in the simulations or to scaling violations .    in fig .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) the effect of a finite @xmath52 is considered and the growth of the characteristic length @xmath83 is shown vs. @xmath105 for @xmath7 both for critical and off - critical quenches .",
    "the asymmetric quench is realized by taking @xmath111 .",
    "the solution for the off - critical case has been obtained on a 256x256 lattice in order to speed up the computation since , as the figure shows , much longer times than in the critical case must be reached in order to observe the asymptotic behavior . for sufficiently long times",
    "one observes @xmath9 in both cases , suggesting that the same coarsening mechanism is at work both for critical and off - critical quenches .",
    "in this paper we have considered the effect of an order parameter dependent mobility on the phase - ordering process of a vectorial system quenched in the ordered region of the phase diagram . this problem has been studied both numerically , by considering the cases @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and analytically in the large-@xmath2 limit , for critical and off - critical quenches .",
    "we have shown that for @xmath7 the dynamics is slowed down with respect to the case @xmath87 , due to the vanishing of the mobility in pure phases .",
    "a power law growth of the typical length @xmath8 is still obeyed in this case but with @xmath9 .",
    "this behavior is exhibited in vectorial systems for all the values of @xmath2 considered and does not depend on the symmetry of the quench , nor on the presence of topological defects .",
    "we conclude that this case falls within a different universality class with respect to @xmath87 . for intermediate values of @xmath30",
    "the system behaves as if @xmath87 asymptotically but a preasymptotic growth with @xmath9 is expected for @xmath30 sufficiently close to 1 .",
    "these features are very reminiscent of those of scalar systems , where the dynamical exponent changes from @xmath27 to @xmath10 when @xmath7 .",
    "it is however important to point out that the scalar models studied in ref.@xcite and @xcite are not perfectly equivalent .",
    "the difference is in the form of the free energy functional which is of the ginzburg - landau type ( quartic polynomial ) in ref.@xcite and of logarithmic type in @xcite . while the polynomial can be seen as the expansion of the logarithmic form for @xmath28 not too far from @xmath112 , for lower temperatures only the logarithmic form provides a correct coarse - grained description of the microscopic dynamics .",
    "this is confirmed by what happens for off - critical quenches to @xmath113 . when the quench is sufficiently asymmetric so that the minority phase forms a non percolating pattern of isolated droplets , surface diffusion alone can not drive the phase - separation to completion .",
    "the system therefore remains pinned in a configuration out of equilibrium .",
    "this pinning is correctly reproduced by the continuum equation with the logarithmic free energy@xcite ; no such pinning is found with the quartic polynomial@xcite . in this last case",
    "the deep off - critical condition has only the effect of changing bulk - diffusion to a slower mechanism ( @xmath10 ) which has been referred to as bulk sub - diffusion .",
    "the dynamical exponent for bulk sub - diffusion turns out to be the same as that for surface diffusion : we do not know whether this equality is accidental or has a deeper meaning .",
    "in our study we have considered the generalization to a vectorial order parameter of the model with ginzburg - landau free energy .",
    "also in this case we find two universality classes for @xmath7 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is perfectly analogous to what happens in the scalar case .",
    "moreover the scaling functions for @xmath87 and @xmath7 are identical .",
    "this leads us to conjecture that a mechanism of the same nature drives phase - ordering for all values of @xmath30 .",
    "the only special feature of the @xmath7 case is that the mechanism is slowed down , exactly as for @xmath26 one goes from bulk diffusion to bulk sub - diffusion , but the nature of the mechanism is still of bulk type .",
    "it would be interesting to check whether a sort of generalized surface diffusion exists for @xmath40 .",
    "this could be detected by solving the equation of motion for @xmath7 with a logarithmic free energy for a vectorial order parameter .",
