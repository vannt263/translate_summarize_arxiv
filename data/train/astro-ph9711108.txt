    "the dynamical evolution of pre- and postcollapse globular clusters is influenced by many factors : the initial mass function , the nature and efficiency of energy generation mechanisms , galactic tides , anisotropy of the velocities , the initial population of binaries , and stellar evolution ( see , for example , spitzer 1987 ) .",
    "if the goal is to model globular clusters realistically , then all of these effects should be included .",
    "on the other hand , if the goal is a deeper theoretical understanding of individual dynamical processes , then simpler models can be more instructive .",
    "a distribution of stellar masses affects the postcollapse evolution of globular clusters in ways that have not been fully explored .",
    "the simplest nontrivial multimass models are those with just two components .",
    "this simplification is drastic but not entirely unrealistic .",
    "since the stellar main - sequence lifetime is a very steep function of stellar mass , a cluster can be assumed to start its dynamical evolution with a turnoff - point mass very similar to that currently observed .",
    "stars with higher mass have already evolved into degenerate remnants ( such as black holes , neutron stars or white dwarfs ) . because of mass segregation ( also called `` mass stratification , '' cf .",
    "spitzer 1987 ) , the inner parts of a dynamically relaxed cluster should consist primarily of the turnoff stars and the heaviest remnants .",
    "the black holes are probably much more massive than present day main - sequence stars , but their number is expected to be too small to play any important dynamical role ( kulkarni , hut , & mcmillan 1993 ) . most of the white dwarfs in a cluster are expected to have masses less than the present turn - off point mass .",
    "the dynamical effects of such white dwarf stars are expected to be unimportant .",
    "kim & lee ( 1997 ) compared the numerical results of two- and 11-component models , which have 3 components for the white dwarfs heavier than the turn - off point mass , and they were able to find two - component cluster parameters that well match the 11-component clusters .",
    "this implies that the presence of the white dwarfs heavier than the turn - off point mass does not harm the two - component approximation .",
    "neutron stars , however , can be an important component in dynamical evolution of globular clusters .",
    "neutron stars are about twice as massive as turnoff stars .",
    "the fraction of the cluster mass in the form of neutron stars is expected to be very small , but mass segregation may make neutron stars major component in the central parts .",
    "( for observational evidence supporting the dominance of heavy degenerates , see gebhardt & fischer 1995 and phinney 1993 . ) as a first approximation , the globular clusters can be represented by two components : neutron stars and main - sequence stars .",
    "two - component clusters have several interesting features that are not present in single - component clusters .",
    "mass segregation accelerates the early phases of core collapse significantly ( e.g. yoshizawa et al .",
    "1978 ; inagaki & wiyanto 1984 ; spitzer 1987 ) .",
    "the central parts quickly become dominated by heavy component , even though bulk of the mass of the cluster is in the light component .",
    "tidal captures between a neutron star and a main - sequence star are frequent , and binaries composed of neutron stars can also be formed by three - body processes .",
    "these binaries will eventually drive the postcollapse evolution .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to obtain a series of solutions for the dynamical evolution of two - component clusters , with emphasis on the postcollapse phase .",
    "we study relative importance of tidal - capture and three - body binary formation for heating the cluster core .",
    "we are particularly interested in the importance of unequal stellar masses for gravothermal oscillations .",
    "our model is quite simple compared to real clusters .",
    "stellar evolution has not been included ; it is most important for the very early evolution of clusters ( chernoff & weinberg 1990 , drukier 1995 ) .",
    "primordial binaries could be even more important than the binaries formed by dynamical processes through the early postcollapse phases ( gao et al .",
    "1991 ) , but we neglect them . we have ignored the tidal field of the galaxy , even though tidal limitation qualitatively alters postcollapse evolution of the cluster mass and radius ( hnon 1961 , lee & goodman 1995 ) , and tidal shocks may further hasten the destruction of clusters ( kundic & ostriker 1995 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "external tidal fields are probably not important for gravothermal oscillations and other phenomena pertaining to the core , except insofar as they modify the total cluster mass .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : models ] , we describe the models and methods of our calculations .",
    "heating mechanisms that derive the postcollapse expansion are compared in  [ sec : heating ] . in ",
    "[ sec : evolution ] , we obtain a series of solutions and give simple analytic expressions for the evolution of parameters of postcollapse clusters .",
    "gravothermal oscillation in two - component models is examined in  [",
    "sec : grav_oscil ] .",
    "the final section summarizes our results .",
    "the dynamical evolution of collisionless stellar systems under the influence of two - body relaxation is well described by the fokker - planck equation .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to isotropic models , in which the stellar orbital distribution function depends only on energy ( and time ) .",
    "a recent study by takahashi , lee , & inagaki ( 1997 ) showed that the radial anisotropy in the halo becomes highly suppressed when a tidal field is imposed .",
    "the global evolution can be simply described by an isotropic model .",
    "the multi - component fokker - planck equation can be written as follows : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the distribution function and the particle flux in energy space @xmath25 , respectively , for the i - th component . formally @xmath26 can be expressed as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the fokker - planck coefficients .",
    "the statistical weight factor @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the maximum radius that a particle with energy @xmath25 can reach in the spherical potential @xmath33 .    in order to account for the effects of binaries ,",
    "we need to modify the fokker - planck equation above .",
    "statler , ostriker & cohn ( 1987 ) developed a sophisticated scheme to include the dynamical effects of tidal binaries for a model initially composed of a single component .",
    "lee ( 1987 ) modified the method of statler et al .",
    "( 1987 ) to include both tidal binaries and three - body binaries .",
    "however , the number of dynamically - produced binaries is always a very small fraction of the total number of stars .",
    "the most important effect is heating ",
    "the addition of entropy to the orbital distribution function  which can be simply accounted for by modifying the particle flux in energy space .",
    "such an approach has been taken in many studies dealing with the three - body binary heating ( see , for example , cohn 1985 ; lee , fahlman , & richer 1991 ) .",
    "normally the tidal binaries are more abundant and simple correction of the particle flux could cause some errors .",
    "however , we find that our approach provide excellent agreement with more complex schemes .",
    "the orbit - averaged heating coefficient due to this heating becomes @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the heating rate per unit volume and @xmath36 the maximum radius accessible to a star with energy @xmath25 .",
    "the modified particle flux then takes the form @xmath37 f_i ( e ) -d_{ee } { \\partial f_i \\over            \\partial e}.\\ ] ] the second - order coefficient ( @xmath29 ) is also affected by binary heating , but this diffusive effect is probably much less important for the long - term evolution than the change in @xmath28 .",
    "heating by tidal binaries is mostly due to their ejection during close encounters with single stars ( or sometimes other binaries ) because the internal binding energy of tidal binaries is much greater than the escape energy from the cluster .",
    "therefore the heating rate per unit volume is the product of the mass in all three stars , the binary formation rate , and the central potential ( lee & ostriker 1993 ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number density , @xmath40 the tidal - capture cross section , @xmath41 the relative rms velocity between degenerate and normal stars , and @xmath42 the central gravitational potential .",
    "the subscript @xmath39 denotes normal stars while @xmath43 represents degenerate stars .",
    "it is assumed that the binary is ejected promptly after formation by interaction with a third star .",
    "we adopt the following expression for @xmath40 from lee & ostriker ( 1986 ) for tidal captures between a normal star and a degenerate star with @xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the escape velocity at the normal star s surface , and @xmath47 the normal star s radius .",
    "binaries formed by dissipationless three - body encounters ( `` three - body binaries '' ) are usually less tightly bound than tidal binaries .",
    "therefore , in their encounters with single stars , some or all of the stars are retained by the cluster and contribute their increased orbital energy to the distribution functions @xmath48 ( `` direct heating '' ) .",
    "until ejected from the cluster , a three - body binary releases approximately 300 @xmath49 , where @xmath49 is the typical kinetic energy of background stars .",
    "thus the three - body binary heating rate per unit volume can be computed by multiplying the binary formation rate per unit volume by 300 @xmath49 : @xmath50 where the summation is over all components , and @xmath51 is the mass weighted , three - dimensional , central velocity dispersion .",
    "the numerical coefficient has been taken from cohn ( 1985 ) .",
    "the modified fokker - planck equation can be accurately integrated with the numerical procedure described by cohn ( 1979 , 1980 ) .",
    "our models assume an initial cluster composed of main - sequence stars with mass @xmath52 and neutron stars with mass @xmath53 .",
    "the total masses in the form of these stars are @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively . the total number of stars is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "we need to specify three dimensionless parameters in addition to the initial density and velocity profiles : the total number of stars @xmath10 , the ratio @xmath21 of a heavy star to a light one , and the number ratio @xmath56 .",
    "the dimensional scales are determined by the total cluster mass @xmath11 , the initial half - mass radius @xmath57 , and the stellar radius @xmath47 .",
    "the ratio @xmath58 is important for tidal heating because it determines the ratio of the capture cross section ( eq . [ [ eq : sigtc ] ] ) to the projected area of the cluster ( or cluster core ) .",
    "the present study may be devided into three topics and each topic has its own set of models .",
    "the detailed model parameters of those sets are listed in tables [ table : heating ] , [ table : a ] , and [ table : b ] .",
    "note that in all our runs , the total mass of the heavy component , @xmath59 , is negligible compared to the total mass of light component , @xmath60 , and thus @xmath61 .",
    "the initial density and velocity profiles are given by plummer models with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath5 is the core density . both three - body binary heating and tidal binary heating are included and clusters are assumed to be isolated ( i.e. no tidal cut - off ) .    our values for @xmath21 range from 2 to 5 .",
    "if we identify @xmath52 with the heaviest main - sequence stars , then @xmath64 is a suitable choice .",
    "since the bulk of the cluster consists of stars below the turnoff , however , @xmath52 should be somewhat smaller than the turnoff - point mass .",
    "finally , we assume a linear mass - radius relation such that @xmath65 corresponds to @xmath66 .",
    "most heating takes place in the core where the stellar and binary number densities are highest . to compare the efficiencies of heating mechanisms ,",
    "we first derive their dependence on core parameters . from equations",
    "( [ edottc ] ) and ( [ edot3b ] ) , @xmath67 in the core is approximately proportional to @xmath68 , while @xmath69 in a core dominated by degenerate stars is approximately proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath71 , which is valid during the postcollapse phase . even during the precollapse phase",
    ", the ratio of potential depth to central velocity dispersion varies very slowly compared with other quantities .",
    "considering again the fact that the core is dominated by degenerate stars , the central heating rate by tidal binaries is proportional to the first power of the central density , and the central heating rate by three - body binaries is proportional to the third power .",
    "since the central velocity dispersion evolves much less than central density , the density of degenerate stars in the core is the most important quantity in deciding the relative efficiency of the two heating mechanisms .",
    "thus the relative importance of three - body binaries increases as the core collapse proceeds .",

    "3b denotes the models whose postcollapse expansion is driven by three - body binaries , and tb by tidal binaries .",
    "three - body binary heating is relatively more important for clusters with smaller @xmath11 and @xmath76 , and larger @xmath57 and @xmath21 .",
    "smaller @xmath76 and larger @xmath21 give larger initial @xmath77 which is favorable to three - body binary formation .",
    "on the other hand , a cluster with very high initial @xmath78 starts its evolution with tidal binary heating rate high enough not to give a change for three - body binary heating to be dominant during the collapse .",
    "kim & lee ( 1997 ) found that the evolution of multi - component models with various power - law mass functions and @xmath11 may be realized with two - component models with @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( the actual fraction of neutron stars in globular clusters is much less than 1/100 , but many low - mass normal stars do not contribute much on the cluster s dynamical evolution ) .",
    "although the dominant heating mechanism is dependent on the mass function ( @xmath21 and @xmath76 ) , all models with typical globular cluster masses and sizes ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) and with the above mass function range are dominated by three - body binary heating in the postcollapse phase as in figure [ fig : heating ] , which is a typical history of the heating rates of our models marked with 3b in table [ table : heating ] .",
    "this dominance of 3b over tb in most plausible parameter range confirms the conclusion of lee ( 1987 ) that in multi - component clusters , three - body binary heating is relatively more important because there are no tidal captures between pairs of degenerate stars .",
    "note that , even for an extreme @xmath76 value of 300 , three - body binary heating is still dominant for clusters with @xmath83 and @xmath1 , which are the parameter ranges that the majority of the present clusters have .",
    "although tidal binary heating is unimportant for postcollapse expansion of models marked with 3b , tidal binary heating becomes more important when @xmath11 and @xmath76 are larger , and when @xmath57 and @xmath21 are smaller .",
    "for example , our two - component model with @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is governed by tidal binary heating in the postcollapse phase ( see figure [ fig : heating_tc ] ) .",
    "it is notable , however , that the three - body binary heating rate increases after core collapse while the rate of heating by tidal binaries is decreasing .",
    "this phenomenon is not expected for single - mass tidal - binary - driven postcollapse clusters , in which the central density and velocity dispersion evolve as @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( lee & ostriker 1993 ) , and the three - body binary heating rate as @xmath91 . in a two - component postcollapse cluster , however , if tidal binaries dominate and equipartition holds in the core , then the central density decreases less rapidly and the central velocity more rapidly than in a single - component cluster ( figure [ fig : rhov_tc ] ) .",
    "in such cases , the heating rate by three - body binaries may even increase during postcollapse expansion .",
    "the ultimate age of the models shown in figures [ fig : heating][fig : converge ] appears unrealistically long .",
    "but the evolution of isolated clusters slows down as @xmath8 expands ( see  3.3 below ) , whereas @xmath8 , @xmath15 , and @xmath11 decrease during the postcollapse evolution of tidally limited clusters , which are more realistic ( cf .",
    "lee & ostriker 1987 ) .",
    "thus , the evolutionary state of an isolated cluster at @xmath92 corresponds roughly to that of a tidally limited one at a much earlier time .",
    "mass loss by overflow of the tidal boundary is much more rapid than ejection of stars by binaries in the core , and depletes primarily the lighter component . by decreasing @xmath76 , this last effect",
    "further suppresses tidal binaries .",

    "whose postcollapse phase is driven by tidal binary heating is expected to be even narrower than our present calculations suggest . as a limiting case , we have re - calculated the two - component models in table [ table : heating ] assuming that the all tidal capture binaries end up with mergers and only the masses of the normal stars are ejected , i.e. @xmath93 the dominant heating mechanism in the postcollapse phase for the models in table [ table : heating ] with the above @xmath94 is shown in table [ table : heating_merge ] . the dominance of tidal binary heating is seen only for few models , because equation ( [ edottc2 ] ) gives @xmath95 times less heating rate than equation ( [ edottc ] ) and thus three - body binaries now become even more important .",

    "their slow expansion on the timescale @xmath15 is almost negligible on the local timescale @xmath120 .",
    "thus these regions resemble equilibrium isothermal spheres , and therefore they are subject to the gravothermal instability studied by antonov ( 1962 ) and lynden - bell & wood ( 1968 ) .",
    "this instability of postcollapse clusters was first found by sugimoto & bettwieser ( 1983 ) and bettwieser & sugimoto ( 1984 ) , and later investigated by a number of scientists .      single - component , isolated clusters in postcollapse form a one - parameter family when they are dominated by three - body binaries . that parameter can be taken to be @xmath10 , the number of stars . in this case ,",
    "gravothermal instability occurs for @xmath154 ( goodman 1987 ) .",
    "the introduction of multiple components brings additional dimensionless parameters , which affect the energy - generation rate in the core and perhaps also the relaxation rate near @xmath8 .",
    "we may therefore expect that the instability should depend on parameters other than @xmath10 .",
    "goodman ( 1993 ) suggested that the quantity @xmath155 should describe the degree of stability universally ( regardless of the presence of mass spectrum ) , where @xmath156 is the energy of the core , and @xmath15 and @xmath120 are half mass and core relaxation times , respectively .",
    "the motivation for this idea is that the core luminosity @xmath157 is stabilizing : equations ( [ rc ] ) and ( [ lc2 ] ) indicate that @xmath157 will increase as the core shrinks and decrease as it expands",
    ". the stabilizing influence will be ineffective if @xmath158 , however , because then the `` equilibrium '' luminosity of the core ( @xmath159 ) is very small compared to the rate at which heat can be removed from the core if isothermal conditions should break down ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "our two - component models provide a test of these ideas since , as goodman ( 1993 ) argued , @xmath20 depends both on @xmath10 and on @xmath21 .",
    "we have performed another set of runs ( group b ) whose parameters were chosen to test the analytical predictions given below .",
    "these simulations include heating by three - body binaries only .",
    "the initial conditions were plummer models with 3 different mass ratios ( @xmath161 1.5 , 2 , 3 ) and 4 different total numbers ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "we have fixed @xmath163 except for four supplementary runs .",
    "the parameters of the group b runs are shown in table [ table : b ] .",

    "figure [ fig : rho+epsilon ] shows that @xmath20 itself oscillates .",
    "an `` equilibrium '' value for @xmath20 can be obtained by adopting integration time steps larger than the typical oscillation period ; with the implicit time integration schemes that we and others use , large time steps suppress the gravothermal oscillations . the equilibrium @xmath20 is almost constant during the whole instability period ( figure [ fig : rho+epsilon ] ) and can be used as a representative value for the postcollapse phase .",
    "these representative @xmath20 s are plotted in figure [ fig : epsil ] against a combination of cluster parameters that will be explained in the following subsection .",
    "there is a clear boundary of stability at @xmath199 , close to the value @xmath200 found by goodman ( 1993 ) for single - component clusters .",
    "it is instructive to compare certain rows in table 2 . runs go04 , go05 , and go06 have the same number of stars in the heavier component but increasing values of @xmath21 , @xmath20 , and @xmath139 .",
    "the first run shows oscillations , and the latter two do not .",
    "therefore , the suggestion of murphy , cohn , & hut ( 1990 ) that stability depends on the number of heavy stars is not borne out by these runs .",
    "note by the way that the number of heavy stars is only @xmath201 , much less than the critical value for instability in single - mass clusters ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the unstable run go04 with run go09 : the latter has three times as many stars in each component but is stable , apparently because of its larger @xmath21 .      in their study on the stability of clusters with three - body binaries and a broad mass spectrum , murphy et al .",
    "( 1990 ) found that stability persists to much larger @xmath10 than in single - mass clusters if the mass function is steep .",
    "they suggested that stability depends mainly on the total number of the heaviest stars .",
    "we believe that @xmath203 is a more reliable criterion for the onset of instability .",
    "we now determine @xmath20 as a function of cluster parameters .",
    "we derive simple scaling relations by analytic arguments and compare the results with our numerical results .",
    "first we reproduce the prediction by goodman ( 1993 ) . from equation ( [ scale ] ) , one obtains @xmath204 now , from equations ( [ mc ] ) , ( [ rc ] ) , and ( [ vc ] ) , the ratio of energies in the cluster and the core is @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the velocity dispersion of the whole cluster .",
    "similarly , the ratio of half - mass to core relaxation time is @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the mean mass in the cluster , and @xmath209 is the mean mass in the core . with @xmath210 and @xmath211 ,",
    "one finally obtains @xmath212 the exponents of mass ratio @xmath213 and 2 in equation ( 18 ) of goodman ( 1993 ) should be corrected to @xmath214 and @xmath215 as in equations ( [ go : r_prop ] ) and ( [ go : epsil_prop ] ) .    we have compared the above scaling relations with our numerical results from runs in group b. the equilibrium @xmath20 values of our runs are plotted in figure [ fig : epsil ] against the righthand side of equation ( [ go : epsil_prop ] ) .",
    "the data points are well aligned and their slope is @xmath216 , slightly higher than the theoretical value of unity",
    ".    this discrepancy is traceable to the deviation of @xmath139 from the predicted scaling ( [ go : r_prop ] ) . in  [ sec : evolution ] , we remarked that our numerical results show a slightly higher slope than expected for @xmath7 ( @xmath217 versus @xmath218 ) and a lower slope for @xmath8 ( @xmath219 versus @xmath218 ) .",
    "thus the slope for @xmath139 should be higher than predicted by our analytic arguments by appproximately @xmath220 for the runs in group a. the correlation between the two sides of equation ( [ go : r_prop ] ) for group b is shown in figure [ fig : rcrh ] .",
    "the slope of these data points is @xmath221 , which is comparable to the one for @xmath20 .",
    "we find that one of the causes of this poor @xmath139 approximation is the assumption that the proportionality constant in equation ( [ rh - t ] ) is independent of cluster parameters .",
    "however , we find that the ratio @xmath222 of our runs ranges from 10 to 15 . runs with larger @xmath21 show larger @xmath222 values and this @xmath21 dependence is more pronounced for runs with larger @xmath10 .",
    "if one lets @xmath223 where the coefficient @xmath224 depends on cluster parameters such as @xmath21 and @xmath10 , one finds @xmath225 then a 23 % variation in @xmath224 would give a 20 % residual in the slope of the correlation between the two sides of equation ( [ rh - t ] ) .",
    "this is approximately what one sees in figure ( 8) , which is based on @xmath21 ranging from @xmath226 to @xmath227 .",
    "although equation ( [ rh - t ] ) has been used widely without consideration of its dependence on cluster parameters , we conclude that the coefficient in this relation varies with the mass function .",
    "we have made four more runs in addition to group b to test the dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath76 , which is not apparent in equation ( [ go : epsil_prop ] ) : two runs with the same parameters as run go05 except @xmath76 = 30 and 300 ( go05a and go05b , respectively ) , and two runs as run go08 except @xmath76 = 30 and 300 ( go08a and go08b , respectively ) .",
    "equilibrium @xmath20 values of these runs are @xmath228 for run go05a , @xmath229 for run go05b , @xmath230 for run go08a , and @xmath231 for run go08b .",
    "these values are all within only 15 % differences from their comparison runs , go05 and go08 , indicating that @xmath20 is independent of @xmath76 as expected in the above energy balance analysis .",
    "however , while gravothermal oscillations are observed in run go08a and not in runs go05a and go05b as expected , it is not observed in run go08b . clearly",
    "the criterion of @xmath232 does not appear to be exact if @xmath233 is too small .",
    "all of our previous analyses assume that there are enough stars in the heavy component so that the core is dominated by them .",
    "this requires that the ratio of core mass to total mass , @xmath234 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : mcore ] ] ) should be smaller than @xmath235 . in order to confine most of the heavy stars to a region much smaller than @xmath8",
    ", we also require @xmath236 : @xmath237 in equipartion ; @xmath238 in the regions well outside the core where the lighter component dominates the potential ; and we require @xmath239 to fall more steeply than @xmath240 in those regions so that most of the heavies are at smaller radii .",
    "all of our runs satisfy these requirements , except where @xmath241 so that the second condition is marginally violated .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of isolated two - component clusters with plummer - model initial conditions .",
    "we have included the main effects of both three - body and tidal - capture binaries by adding a heating term to the fokker - planck equation .      in the postcollapse phase",
    ", we find that heating by three - body binaries exceeds that by tidal binaries at least for clusters with @xmath83 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 when @xmath242 .",
    "when three - body binary heating does dominate , the expansion of the postcollapse cluster is self - similar . scaling laws for cluster parameters including the central density , velocity dispersion , core radius , and half - mass radius",
    "have been derived from simple considerations of energy balance , and these scalings generally agree well with our numerical results , which however also provide the numerical coefficients in the scaling laws .",
    "we related the postcollapse evolution of these cluster parameters to @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath9 .",
    "we have studied the gravothermal oscillation phenomenon using our two - component models .",
    "we have confirmed that the parameter @xmath20 = @xmath243 predicts the occurence of gravothermal oscillations in the presence of this simplest of nontrivival mass functions .",
    "the scaling law for @xmath20 with respect to @xmath9 and @xmath10 is derived in the limit of small @xmath56 and compared with our numerical results . generally speaking ,",
    "clusters with a steeper mass function are less susceptible to gravothermal instability .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with an earlier suggestion by murphy et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , but whereas these authors suggested that stability depends on the number of heavy stars , we conclude that it is independent of the number of heavies but depends jointly on the total number of stars and on the ratio of the individual stellar masses in the two components .",
    "these conclusions need to be tested against models with more mass components .",
    "our preliminary studies indicate that the evolution of multi - mass clusters is generally similar to two - component models for an appropriate choice of model parameters ( mostly suitable @xmath21 ) . in order to compare with real clusters ,",
    "we need to take into account a host of complicating physical effects , most importantly an external tidal field .",
    "the results of these studies will be reported elsewhere .",
