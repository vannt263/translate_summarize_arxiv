    "over the last few years and thanks to the advent of large - area photometric surveys such as the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , the substructured nature of the milky way halo has been clearly revealed . in recent years",
    "the number of known galactic dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) has more than doubled ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and numerous stellar streams have been identified ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these discoveries lend significant support to currently favored cold dark matter cosmological models , which predict that spiral galaxies form hierarchically from the merger and accretion of smaller subsystems ( e.g. , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "one exciting aspect of these discoveries is that they have revealed a previously unknown population of  ultra - faint \" dwarf galaxies which are claimed to contain the highest dark matter fractions reported to date , with mass - to - light ratios above @xmath3 ( m / l)@xmath4 in some cases ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but luminosities as low as @xmath5 l@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "a few of these satellites , coma , segue 1 , segue 2 and botes ii , have properties closer to those of globular clusters than those of  classical \" dsphs ( e.g. , half - light radii between 30 and 70 pc ) , and have been suggested to be satellites of satellites @xcite .    in this letter we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of another potential dwarf satellite ,",
    "the botes iii stellar overdensity ( booiii ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g09 ) ) .",
    "this peculiar object , located at a distance of 46 kpc and with @xmath6-band absolute magnitude of @xmath7 @xcite , has a roughly power - law surface brightness profile and an irregular shape .",
    "our study suggests that booiii is likely a dwarf satellite in a transitional state between a bound entity and an unbound stellar stream . in this context",
    ", booiii resembles the objects described by @xcite but likely with a high dark matter content .",
    "radial velocities ( rvs ) were measured from spectra obtained in 2009 february with the hectospec multifiber spectrograph @xcite mounted at the f/5 focus on the 6.5 m mmt .",
    "targets were selected from the sdss stellar database to lie on or near the booiii color - magnitude sequence from @xcite , in a magnitude range of 18.5@xmath822.5 .",
    "we also included candidate blue horizontal - branch ( bhb ) stars that are near the bhb locus in figure 13 of @xcite , bringing the total number of assigned targets in the @xmath91 degree hectospec field of view to 227 .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath10 versus @xmath11 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for all stars within 0.5@xmath12 of the booiii center , as well as an old , metal - poor isochrone chosen to be similar to that of m15 ( the cluster which guided our target selection ) .",
    "we used the 600 gpm grating , centered at 5800 , to give a working wavelength range of 4550 - 7050  at a dispersion of @xmath90.55 @xmath13pixel@xmath1 ( 2.1   resolution ) .",
    "this region was selected to include the h@xmath14 , mg triplet , na d , and h@xmath15 spectral features .",
    "queue - observed integrations totaled 3 @xmath16 1800 s on ut 2009 february 3 , and 6 @xmath16 1800 s on ut 2009 february 20 , for a summed exposure of 4.5 hr on this field .",
    "sky fibers ( 57 in all ) were assigned throughout the field , distributed so that a number of them would fall within each of the two ccd chips of the hectospec system .",
    "a total of 193 target spectra had star - like spectra ( there were a number of background qsos / agn ) , with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n @xmath17 10 ) for rv measurement .",
    "the hectospec data were reduced using an external version of the sao `` specroad '' reduction pipeline @xcite written by juan cabanela , called especroad .",
    "the pipeline automates many reduction steps , including bias - correction , flat - fielding , cosmic - ray rejection , fiber - to - fiber throughput adjustments , and sky subtraction .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed manually using sets of three combined henear calibration lamp exposures from each night of observing .",
    "we derived rvs using the iraf task fxcor to cross - correlate object spectra against two template g8v rv standards , each observed three times .",
    "we first correlated the standard spectra against each other , and found that to achieve agreement between our measurements and published rvs for these stars , it was necessary to shift all rvs measured against one of them by 6 km s@xmath1 .",
    "after doing so , the measured rvs for all six standard spectra agree with published values to within 1.0 km s@xmath1 . to minimize the effects of noise for spectra with lower s / n , the cross - correlation was restricted to the regions around the h@xmath15 , mg triplet , and h@xmath14 lines .",
    "the standard deviation of six rv measurements for most objects ( after applying the 6 km s@xmath1 shift discussed above ) was less than 1 km s@xmath1 , increasing to @xmath93 km s@xmath1 at @xmath1822 .    to estimate rv uncertainties",
    ", we separated our nine individual object exposures into three sets of three summed exposures , totaling 1.5 hr of exposure each .",
    "we then measured rvs in each of these three independent frames , and fit a curve to the run of standard deviation of the three measurements as a function of magnitude .",
    "we used this fit to the trend of @xmath19 versus @xmath11 for the brighter stars in our sample to assign an rv uncertainty for each star we observed based on its magnitude ( extrapolating the curve for fainter stars having insufficient signal to measure an rv from the 1.5 hr exposures ) .",
    "velocity uncertainties vary from @xmath20 km s@xmath1 at @xmath2118.5 to @xmath910 km s@xmath1 at @xmath22 21 ( and higher at fainter magnitudes ) .",
    "figure 2 shows rvs for all stars in our sample with reliable measurements ( s / n @xmath17 10 ) . for comparison ,",
    "we show ( red dot - dashed curve ) a scaled rv distribution from @xmath9100 realizations of the besanon galactic model @xcite along this line of sight , covering the same magnitude and color ranges as our targets .",
    "since this field is at high galactic latitude ( @xmath23 ) , blue stars at faint magnitudes are mostly milky way halo main sequence turnoff stars , with a large ( @xmath9100 km s@xmath1 ) velocity dispersion .",
    "this halo distribution is well matched by our data set .",
    "however , two significant excesses with respect to the expected halo distribution , at v@xmath24 of -180 km s@xmath1 and @xmath9200 km s@xmath1 , are visible in the histogram . to determine whether one of these rv signatures is associated with booiii we check the velocities of the six candidate booiii bhb stars we have included from the `` clump '' in figure 13 of @xcite ( asterisk symbols in figure 1 ) .",
    "interestingly , all six of these stars have velocities within the @xmath9200 km s@xmath1 peak , with a mean value of v@xmath25 km s@xmath1 and dispersion 13.7 km s@xmath1 . since none of the bhb candidates have velocities within the negative rv peak , we identify this positive , high - velocity peak with the booiii kinematical signature .",
    "having thus identified booiii s systemic velocity , we select other stars within 3-@xmath26 of this bhb velocity peak as candidate booiii members . these stars are highlighted in the @xmath10 versus @xmath11 cmd in figure 1 .",
    "the good agreement between the isochrone for an old , metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] = -2.30 ) population and the booiii rv candidates suggests that we are indeed seeing the red giant branch of an old , metal - poor , comoving population of stars .",
    "cross - correlation of bhb spectra in our sample against the two available g - dwarf standard spectra results in rvs with higher uncertainties than we derive for the later - type stars in our sample .",
    "this is due to the mismatch in spectral type and spectral line profiles between the bhb candidates and the rv standard stars .",
    "because of this , the scatter in our bhb rvs is likely artificially high , potentially leading to higher field - star contamination in our 3-@xmath26 velocity selection . in order to reach a cleaner sample of booiii members ,",
    "we further exclude stars that are more than 0.25 magnitudes from the isochrone shown in figure 1 .",
    "this leaves our final sample of 20 booiii candidate members ( 14 if the bhb stars are excluded ) , which is represented in figures 1 , 3 , and 4 with large filled symbols and asterisks .",
    "stellar atmospheric parameters for all observed stars other than the bhb candidates are determined using low - resolution lick spectral indices ( as defined by @xcite ) . measured indices for all input spectra",
    "are placed onto the standard lick index system of @xcite using offsets derived from standard spectra observed with the same telescope / instrument setup .",
    "we derive a suitable estimate of the effective temperature , @xmath27 , of each star based on its ( @xmath28 ) photometric color .",
    "relatively accurate dwarf / giant separation is then performed using the gravity - sensitive mg b feature at @xmath29   , with stars sorting well by gravity in the mg b - h@xmath14 index plane ( h@xmath14 is primarily sensitive to @xmath27 ) .",
    "the metallicity , [ fe / h ] , for each star is determined using two methods ; from the @xcite spectral library we have derived separate polynomial surface fits of ( 1 ) [ fe / h ] to the lick iron indices and stellar color , and ( 2 ) [ fe / h ] as a function of the iron indices and h@xmath14 ( similar to the @xcite interpolation between lines of constant metallicity , or the @xcite fitting functions ) . thus , moderately accurate estimates of [ fe / h ] derive from the combination of all six lick iron indices falling within the observed spectral bandpass as well as the stellar color and h@xmath14 index .",
    "measured metallicities as a function of @xmath30 are shown in figure 3 .",
    "we estimate typical uncertainties in [ fe / h ] of @xmath90.3 - 0.5 dex , depending on the magnitude of the star . according to @xcite ,",
    "the matched - filter signal of booiii is strongest for the most metal - poor filter applied ( m15 : [ fe / h]=-2.26 ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the m15 ridgeline provides the best fit to the cmd locus of booiii ( @xcite , figure 12 ) .",
    "we thus expect the majority of booiii members to be metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath31 -2.0 ) .",
    "examining the stars within the 3-@xmath26 rv selection in figure 3 , we note that a number of candidates are indeed rather metal - poor .",
    "furthermore , both of the stars with s / n @xmath17 20 spectra that were excluded from the final sample as likely foreground contaminants ( i.e. open triangles in figures 1 , 3 , and 4 ) have measured [ fe / h ] @xmath17 -1.8 .    from the individual stellar metallicities of our final sample ( excluding the bhb stars )",
    "we derive a maximum likelihood estimation of [ fe / h ] @xmath32 -2.1 @xmath330.2 for booiii .",
    "since these individual values are derived from low s / n spectra , we shift the booiii candidate spectra to rest wavelength and stack them to produce a higher s / n spectrum .",
    "doing so , we derive [ fe / h ] @xmath32 -2.0 , which is consistent with all other measurements for booiii . at the integrated @xmath6-band absolute magnitude of booiii , @xmath34 @xcite ,",
    "our measured metallicity is typical for a dwarf galaxy ( see figure 11 of @xcite ) , and more metal - poor than all galactic globular clusters at similar luminosity . as is obvious from figure 3",
    ", there is a fairly large metallicity spread in the booiii candidate stars ( @xmath35 } \\approx$ ] 0.6 ) .",
    "this may be due to foreground contamination of our sample , though as seen in figure 2 , very few galactic stars are expected at these velocities .",
    "this spread in [ fe / h ] is comparable to ( though slightly higher than ) those found by @xcite for a number of other ultrafaint dwarfs ( see their table 4 ) , and may reflect the presence of multiple generations of star formation among the booiii stellar population .      with our final sample of booiii candidates ,",
    "we use the maximum likelihood method ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) to derive the systemic velocity and velocity dispersion of botes iii . for the full sample ( 20 stars , including the 6 bhb stars )",
    ", we find @xmath0 km s@xmath1 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath2 km s@xmath1 .",
    "removing the bhb stars ( leaving 14 total ) , the result is virtually unchanged : @xmath36 km s@xmath1 , and @xmath37 km s@xmath1  we thus consider only the full sample henceforth . at the position and distance of booiii",
    ", this @xmath38 converts to an unusually high galactic standard of rest velocity of @xmath39 km s@xmath1 which implies that booiii is on a very radial ( and thus potentially destructive ) orbit .",
    "this idea of a high - latitude object on a rather eccentric orbit agrees with the suggestion by @xcite that booiii may be extended along the line of sight ( i.e. , along its orbit ) .",
    "our measured dispersion of 14 km s@xmath1 for booiii is the highest measured line - of - sight velocity dispersion of any dsph , even higher than the central dispersion of sagittarius , the most massive of the galactic dsph galaxies .",
    "it has been shown in previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) that even if a satellite is experiencing tidal disruption , its @xmath40 remains unaffected by tides _",
    "unless _ the system is at or near the point of complete destruction ( as we believe is the case for booiii ) .",
    "in this context , it is possible that even in the case of sagittarius the central dispersion reflects the equilibrium value .",
    "the same studies , in particular @xcite , show that when a satellite is on the brink of being completely destroyed by the action of tides , its central velocity dispersion inflates in some cases by more than a factor of 2 . if booiii was originally a system similar to the classical dsphs , with a half - light radius of @xmath41 pc and a velocity dispersion of @xmath42 km s@xmath1 , then its current measured value of 14 km s@xmath1 is consistent with a scenario wherein booiii is near complete destruction .    in order to estimate the dynamical mass of booiii",
    "we use a method recently developed by @xcite which relies solely on the central velocity dispersion and the half - light radius of the system , and assumes neither that the density distribution of the satellite follows a king - like profile nor that mass follows light .",
    "we note that this does assume we are observing a bound system in dynamical equilibrium , which we argue is _ not _ the case for botes iii . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "however , we carry out the exercise .",
    "the expression derived by wolf et al . depends only on direct observables , and is independent of the velocity anisotropy : @xmath43 . here",
    ", @xmath44 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath45 is the three - dimensional deprojected half - light radius , and @xmath46 is the two - dimensional projected half - light radius ( using their derived approximation @xmath47 ) . substituting for the constants , this can be expressed as m@xmath48 m@xmath4 . taking our measured velocity dispersion @xmath49 km s@xmath1 , we find m@xmath50 m@xmath4 , where we ve left @xmath46 explicit to allow for the as - yet unmeasured surface brightness profile of booiii .",
    "this derived mass is rather typical for a dsph system ",
    "@xcite showed that local group dwarf galaxies all share a common mass scale of the order of @xmath51 measured within the inner @xmath52 pc of these satellites ( as had earlier been suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "note that the above mass estimate for booiii would be three times higher if we take @xmath53300 pc , although the true @xmath46 is likely to be smaller ( @xcite ) .",
    "adopting @xmath54 gives a total luminosity of @xmath55 l@xmath4 . using this value along with our mass estimate",
    ", we derive a total mass - to - light ratio of ( m / l)@xmath56 ( m / l)@xmath57 . a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath91000 is similar to those measured for the ultrafaint dsphs of similar @xmath58 ( e.g. @xcite , figure 15 ) .",
    "despite the seemingly  normal \" mass derived for booiii we argue that a number of pieces of evidence support the idea that booiii is not in dynamical equilibrium and it is likely in a transitional state between a bound system and a completely unbound stellar stream  similar to the objects described by @xcite but with a high dark matter content . as we have already suggested , the fact that booiii has the highest measured line - of - sight velocity dispersion of any dsph is consistent with the observation ( from , e.g. , @xcite ) that a satellite in the throes of complete tidal disruption can have its velocity dispersion inflated by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "tidal disruption seems quite plausible , since the large measured galactocentric velocity for booiii places it in a highly elongated , and thus potentially destructive , orbit .",
    "morphological evidence further supports the suggestion that botes iii is a dissolving dwarf galaxy in the final stages of tidal destruction .",
    "the density distribution derived by @xcite ( and confirmed by @xcite ) is quite unusual .",
    "most dsphs , with perhaps the exception of a few of the new ultrafaint ones which are suspected to be undergoing tidal stripping , have density profiles that are well described by king - like or plummer - like profiles .",
    "in contrast , figure 11 of @xcite ( and discussion by @xcite ) shows that booiii is better described by a power law of index -1 .",
    "this observational result is also consistent with the idea of a satellite on the brink of destruction .",
    "several studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have shown that a satellite which started with a king - like density distribution develops a power law - like distribution in the outer parts of its luminous component as it undergoes tidal stripping ( due to escaping stars at large radii ) . eventually , and as the satellite becomes nearly unbound , the king - like core also turns into a power - law like distribution . furthermore , grillmair ( 2009 ; fig .",
    "10 ) showed that booiii has irregular stellar surface density contours and is extended along the east - west direction . in figure 4 , we show the spatial distribution of our spectroscopic targets overlaid on contours of the @xcite filtered star counts . though our single mmt+hectospec setup covers only a fraction of the rather large booiii stellar overdensity , the identified rv members seem to follow the booiii contours .",
    "the styx stellar stream also passes through the same region of the sky where booiii is located , and at nearly the same distance ( @xcite ) .",
    "booiii may be associated with this stream , and indeed may even be its progenitor . however , further kinematical information along the styx stream will be necessary to confirm the association ."
