    "for example , an extra contribution to @xmath14 , @xmath15 , decay amplitudes with a new cp phase can alleviate the @xmath16 discrepancy between the measured mixing - induced cp asymmetries in these @xmath13 penguin modes and the standard model prediction @xcite .",
    "if this new contribution involves @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks with the same chirality , no tension with the well - measured @xmath19 branching fraction occurs .",
    "supersymmetric grand - unified models can naturally accommodate such new @xmath20 amplitudes @xcite : right - handed quarks reside in the same quintuplets of su(5 ) as left - handed neutrinos , so that the large atmospheric neutrino mixing angle could well affect squark - gluino mediated @xmath13 transitions @xcite .",
    "obviously @xmath21  mixing  plays an important role in the search for new physics in @xmath13 fcnc s . in this",
    "talk i present an update of the theory predictions of the physics observables related to @xmath21  mixing . since the formalism equally applies to @xmath22  mixing ,",
    "the corresponding quantities for the @xmath3 system are also presented .",
    "the presented results are derived with the use of a novel operator basis , which leads to a better precision of the theory predictions .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "@xmath23  oscillations are governed by a schrdinger equation @xmath24 with the mass matrix @xmath25 and the decay matrix @xmath26 and @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",

    "we concentrate on the phenomenological impact of this year s discovery of @xmath21  mixing  and the precise measurement of @xmath7 @xcite : @xmath62 @xmath63 determines @xmath64 , so that ckm uncertainties are not an issue for @xmath7 .",
