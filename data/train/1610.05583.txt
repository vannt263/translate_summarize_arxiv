    "in the arrow - debreu framework ( @xcite ) , an auctioneer establishes equilibrium prices . in intertemporal models",
    ", these prices may display all sorts of dynamics , always brought about by the auctioneer .",
    "unfortunately , the auctioneer is an auxiliary entity not to be found in actual economies .",
    "however , attempts to remove the auctioneer from economic models have consistently run in the unsolved question of how to understand and model non - equilibrium price dynamics .    in a non - equilibrium situation ,",
    "usually it is assumed that prices somehow adjust according to excess demand ( @xmath1 , see e.g. @xcite ) . but making this assumption , still the system dynamics can become arbitrarily complex , and it is not clear if a stable equilibrium will be obtained , a fact which is known as the sonnenschein - mantel - debreu ( smd ) theorem ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "an overview of the problems arising from the smd theorem is given in @xcite .",
    "in the real world , when there is what is usually called a free market , the dynamics of prices results from the behaviour of a large number of different actors . theoretically , such a system can be simulated using agent - based model with many agents following their decision rules .",
    "an important attempt of understanding the dynamics of general equilibrium by agent - based modelling can be found in @xcite . in such models",
    ", agents can have only incomplete information and take decisions based on expectations instead ( e.g. @xcite ) . for modelling price dynamics",
    "it is not too easy a challenge to model the behaviour of the agents in detail ( since it is also not known in detail how real agents behave ) , and thus usually very rough assumptions are made , supposing that agents try to optimise their own utility . on the other hand , in many cases",
    "the general - equilibrium picture of clearing markets seems to be a good representation of what is happening in the real world .",
    "so the agent - based model allowing us to abandon the auctioneer should still be able to deliver these equilibrium results .",
    "the additional value of such an agent - based model is then supposed to be a better understanding of ( real world ) situations where an economic equilibrium is not obtained or disturbed ( @xcite ) .    in this paper , the approach for getting rid of the auctioneer and modelling an out - of equilibrium price - dynamics is the following : a price setting entity observes excess demand at the current price and updates the price for the next period accordingly .",
    "let s assume that the price setting party seeks economic equilibrium but does not have complete information ( because in that case it would be the auctioneer ) .",
    "observation of some previous price and excess demand pairs @xmath2 does not suffice to determine the next price .",
    "additional assumptions have to be made , and since there is no further insight into the future decisions of other actors , these additional assumptions of the price setter have to be grounded in expectations about the aggregate supply and demand . but",
    "this means that the present state of the system is influenced by expectations about the future .",
    "linking the present state with expectations of the future , however , is what keynes identified as one of the essential characteristics of money : `` or , perhaps , we might make our line of division between the theory of stationary equilibrium and the theory of shifting equilibrium  meaning by the latter the theory of a system in which changing views about the future are capable of influencing the present situation . for the importance of money essentially flows from its being a link between the present and the future . ''",
    "( @xcite , chapter 21 ) in this work , we investigate how the existence and amount of money in our very basic model influences the system s dynamics .",
    "although here the availability of money is not taken into account when expectations are formed , we see that it limits the possibilities of the system to evolve over time .",
    "the amount of money thus influences which state the system converges to , i.e. whether starting out of equilibrium an economic equilibrium is obtained eventually .",
    ", width=321 ]    for understanding some very fundamental principles , we intended to use a model as simple as possible :    * there two aggregate agents and two goods .",
    "good prices are set by one of the agents , with the other one reacting to the proposed price .",
    "the agents interact repeatedly . in our model ,",
    "the agents are an aggregate firm that produces a consumption good ( for brevity called jelly ) from labour , and an aggregate household that supplies labour and consumes jelly . *",
    "the agents have preferences / decision rules that determine their supply and demand of the different goods .",
    "the aggregate firm optimises its profit and the aggregate household its utility to determine supply and demand . *",
    "the price setting agent has expectations about the relation of prices and aggregate supply / demand . in our model ,",
    "prices are set by the firm . *",
    "the price setting agent updates his expectations using observations about the actual excess demand at the prices that have been set before .",
    "figure [ f : modeloverview ] gives an overview of the agents and their interactions .",
    "there are three versions of the model which differ in if and how money is part of the economic system .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows : in section [ s : agents ] the agents are described in detail , and it is explained how transactions between agents take place .",
    "the three different model versions are discriminated . in section [",
    "s : dynamics ] the dynamics of the system is discussed , and it is analysed which are the possible states ( equilibria ) it converges to .",
    "section [ s : simulations ] shows some simulations illustrating the findings of section [ s : dynamics ] .",
    "sections [ s : dynamics ] and [ s : simulations ] only deal with the first two versions of the model in which ",
    "although there might be something like `` auxiliary money ''  labour serves as numraire . in section [ s : realmoney ] the third version of in the model is introduced . here",
    "money has the role of a third commodity ( and is numraire ) .",
    "section [ s : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "the objective of the household is to maximise its utility subject to its budget constraint . here",
    ", we have chosen a standard cobb - douglas utility function @xmath3 depending on labour @xmath4 and jelly consumption @xmath5 : @xmath6 @xmath7 is the maximum amount of labor force available . as usual , households are assumed to maximise @xmath8 , interpreted as leisure time , and consumption @xmath5 subject to a budget constraint . in the versions of the model we focus on in this paper .",
    "the household s utility optimisation for the third version is given in section [ s : household2 ] ] , the budget constraint of the household is given by @xmath9 @xmath10 is the price of jelly , @xmath11 the wage .",
    "equation ( [ e : budgetconstraint ] ) means that the household plans to spend its total income to buy jelly .",
    "maximising the utility given in ( [ e : utility ] ) subject to the budget constraint ( [ e : budgetconstraint ] ) yields a utility maximum at @xmath12 the cobb - douglas form of ( [ e : utility ] ) together with constraint ( [ e : budgetconstraint ] ) implies that @xmath13 only depends on @xmath14 and not on the wage - to - price ratio @xmath15 .",
    "indifference curves have the form @xmath16 in figure [ f : indifference ] , utility maxima are shown for different wage - to - price ratios @xmath17 .    , for different @xmath11-@xmath10-ratios ( red ) and indifference curves , @xmath18 , for different constants @xmath19 ( blue ) in the @xmath4-@xmath5-plane .",
    "the maxima of @xmath20 subject to @xmath21 all lie on the vertical at @xmath22 .",
    "[ f : indifference],width=173 ]        in a situation of perfect competition of many firms , the aggregate firm must realise zero profits ( @xcite ) . thus ,",
    "maximisation of actual profits by individual firms results in minimisation of absolute profits by the aggregate firm .",
    "therefore , the aggregate firm minimises the absolute value of the difference of revenues and expenditures : @xmath23    in most of what is discussed in this paper , labour serves as numraire , i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "the production function is assumed to be @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 ) .",
    "let s assume that the firm s demand expectations can be represented by a function @xmath27 ( that means at a jelly price of @xmath28 the firm expects the jelly demand to be @xmath5 ) .",
    "the optimisation problem becomes @xmath29 that means it can be written as @xmath30    in the model , the firm optimizes its expected profit to determine prices , planned labour demand , and planned jelly supply .",
    "the firm s planned labour demand is the argument of the profit optimisation given in ( [ e : profitoptl ] ) .",
    "if it is also the actual labour demand depends on whether the firm can afford to employ as much labour as it would like to , as explained in section [ s : evorules ] .",
    "an extension of the firm s optimisation for the case that money serves as numraire and thus wages have to be set by the firm as well is given in section [ s : profitopt2 ] .",
    "the firm s expectations have standard textbook form .",
    "the firm assumes a falling demand curve for jelly ( and , for the case that labour is not the numraire , a rising supply curve for labour ) .",
    "the updates of its expectation functions are based on observations of the household s jelly demand ( and , in the third version of the model , labour supply ) . at each time step ,",
    "information about the actual supply and demand at the current price is obtained by the firm and this information is used to update the expectation function(s ) .",
    "however , it is assumed that the firm has also a certain unwillingness to change its expectations essentially at every time step .",
    "a schematic overview of the algorithm used to update the expected labour demand function is given in figure [ f : learningfirm ] .     the firm wants to supply . 2 . to set the price",
    ", the firm evaluates its expected demand function @xmath27 at @xmath31 . the outcome @xmath32 is set as jelly price .",
    "3 . at price @xmath33",
    ", the jelly demand @xmath34 might be different from @xmath35 .",
    "the firm uses this information to update its expected demand function . in the next time step ,",
    "the firm uses this new expected demand function .",
    "[ f : learningfirm],width=506 ]    the updating algorithm adjusts the parameters for the expected demand ( and supply ) functions recursively .",
    "it approximates the last two observations .",
    "furthermore , the firm s is supposed to have a certain unwillingness to make dramatic changes to the parameters used in the past . for the functional forms of @xmath27 and",
    "the updating algorithm used in the below simulations see the appendix .",
    "having introduced the agents and their decision rules , the question arises if and how the agents can fulfill their consumption / production plans . for producing / consuming they need to interact mutually which is  as usual  supposed to happen on markets",
    "the fact that the model allows for non - equilibrium states requires rules for what happens for non - clearing markets .    in an exchange economy in equilibrium , transactions in all markets can be thought of as taking place instantaneously ( although a temporal order may be natural , as e.g.  in the case that labour has to be hired in order to produce a good sold in another market ) .",
    "all actors optimise their respective objective functions and prices are set by the auctioneer in a way that all markets clear .",
    "that means that all the agents plans of how much of all goods to buy or sell can be fulfilled .    on the other hand , in a non - equilibrium situation",
    ", unmet supply or demand in one market can make it impossible for actors to follow their plans in other markets like in the above production example : if a producer is not able to hire as much labour as she has planned , she may not be able to produce as much as she had planned and thus her supply in the production good market may differ from her planned supply .",
    "this illustrates that for a non - equilibrium situation the temporal order of transactions in the different markets matters .",
    "however , the exchange of goods is usually thought of as an instantaneous act , otherwise the value of the good changing owners first has somehow to be stored by the seller until he buys the other good for this stored value .",
    "this means that value has to be stored at least for a short time .",
    "it suggests the introduction of ( something like ) money as a store of value for non - equilibrium situations",
    ".    in particular , in our model there are two markets , a labour and a jelly market , with the following features :    * in both markets if supply does not equal demand , the short side of the market prevails . * in every time step , first transactions take place in the labor market and later in the jelly market . * in both markets , the buyer is limited by her budget , i.e. there is an upper limit of how much she can afford .",
    "if there is money , this upper limit is given by her cash balance .",
    "if there is no money , things become a bit trickier : for the household ( buyer in the jelly market ) the upper limit is given by the value of labour he sold at the last transaction in the labour market . for the firm ( buyer in the labour market ) the budget is given by the value of jelly she sold at the last transaction in the jelly market .    introducing money in the system",
    "makes the system more complex .",
    "for example , in raises the questions of supply and demand for money , and if there is a demand for money that means that more expectations are introduced to the model .",
    "however , the fact that we need to store value - at least for the short time between transactions in the two markets - suggests the introduction of some kind of money . in this paper",
    "we focus on two versions of the model , one without money and one with something like `` light '' money :    1 .",
    "first version ( no money ) : there is no money , only jelly and labour of equal value can be exchanged ( quasi-)instantaneously , that means in the implementation two transactions are executed one after another ( thus the value of labour or jelly can be stored for a short period of time , i.e. from the point of time transactions take place in one market to the point they take place in the other market ) .",
    "second version ( money version 1 ) : `` money '' exists as a store of value , and in the beginning firm and household may have a certain amount of money at their disposal .",
    "however , for the household s utility optimisation money is irrelevant , as well as in the firm s profit optimisation .",
    "that means that there is no demand for money .",
    "labour is still the numraire , and the price of money equals one , i.e. one unit of money always has the same value as one unit of labour .",
    "money is used to store value in units of labour .    at the end of the paper , with a third model version",
    "we give an outlook of how to modify the money `` light '' to make it become more similar to real money :    1 .   in the third version ( money version 2 ) it is assumed that the household wishes to keep a fraction @xmath36 of its current income in cash ( e.g. to cover unforeseen costs in the future ) .",
    "this is implemented by changing the boundary condition in the household s utility optimisation , as given in equation ( [ e : budgetconstraintm ] ) .",
    "this means that a demand for money is created .",
    "money serves as numraire , the price of labour may be different from one .",
    "the firm sets the wage based on its expectations about the labour supply in the same way as the jelly price is set based on expectations about the jelly demand ( see section [ s : expandlearn ] ) .",
    "thus , in money version 2 the two - commodity model is transformed into a three - commodity model .",
    "+    in the following ( sections [ s : dynamics ] and [ s : simulations ] ) , we focus on the first two cases . a discussion of money version 2 is given in section [ s : realmoney ] .",
    "often it is assumed that economies are usually in economic equilibrium ( all markets clear ) , and that this is a stable state .",
    "that means if they are pushed out of it they will came back to it quickly .",
    "this common assumption , however , is not part of general equilibrium theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "so when we look at the dynamics of our simple model we are particularly interested in whether an initial out - of - equilibrium state of the system always converges to an economic equilibrium .",
    "but firstly , we still have to define rules for how our systems evolves over time which is done in the first part of this section . in the second part",
    "it is discussed how the economic equilibria look like in our model and the last part addresses the question just raised , that is whether the systems obtains economic equilibrium eventually .      if an aggregate household and firm interact along the lines indicated above , it is useful to consider an iterated cycle involving the following steps :    1 .   _ firm plans production _ : the firm has expectations about the household s jelly demand and labour supply . by optimizing its expected profit the firm plans the jelly production , and thus the labour demand , and sets the jelly price @xmath10 accordingly . however , the labour demand @xmath37 is limited by the firm s budget . in the version without money ,",
    "the budget limitation is given by the revenues of the last jelly transaction , in the case that there is money by the firm s monetary holdings .",
    "_ household plans consumption _ : optimising its utility function subject to its budget constraint the household decides how much labour @xmath38 to offer and how much jelly it plans to consume given price @xmath10 .",
    "labour market transactions _ : in the labour market , the short side of the market prevails , i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "_ firm produces jelly _ : using @xmath40 the firm produces the actual jelly supply @xmath35 . if @xmath41 , @xmath35 equals the planned supply but if @xmath42 , @xmath35 is less than the planned production .",
    "_ household decides jelly demand _ : if @xmath43 the household s jelly demand @xmath35 equals the planned consumption , if @xmath44 the household demands as much jelly as it can afford .",
    "if there is no money , this always means @xmath45 , with money the jelly demand might be different since the household can also use money from the last period to acquire jelly .",
    "6 .   _ jelly market transactions _ : in the jelly market , the short side of the market prevails , i.e. @xmath46 . 7 .",
    "_ expectations update _ : using the transaction information ( actual jelly demand @xmath34 at price @xmath10 ) the firm updates its jelly demand expectation function .    with money ,",
    "the cycle is close to the intuition of everyday life in a modern economy . where supply and demand do not match",
    ", the difference will affect the money holdings of the agents .",
    "if the firm can hire less labour than it intended , it will remain with more money than it planned , if the household can sell less labour than it intended , it will remain with less money than it planned .",
    "the analogous pattern arises with sales of jelly .    with money",
    "the monetary holdings are a constraint for what an agent can plan to buy and also for what she may actually buy when plans can not be realised . without money",
    "we set an analogous constraint .",
    "the labour sold by the household in step 3 then defines a budget constraint for step 5 , and the jelly sold by the firm in step 5 defines a budget constraint for step 3 in the subsequent cycle",
    ".    it might be useful to point out that in this paper we use the term _ budget constraint _ for the budget constraint the household takes into account when optimising its utility , given in equation ( [ e : budgetconstraint ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , we use the term _ budget limitations _ for the limitations household and firm might experience when the want to meet their demands but their monetary holdings , or for the case without money their revenues from the last market interaction , do not suffice to do that completely ( see steps 1 and 5 ) .",
    "budget limitations are not taken into account in the respective optimisations .",
    "the term equilibrium is used in different ways , for our purposes it is useful to clearly differentiate between economic equilibria , i.e. states of the system where supply equals demand in all markets , and dynamic equilibria , i.e. fixed points of the dynamic system .",
    "of course , economic equilibria can be fixed points , and vice versa , but this is not necessarily the case . + the system being studied here has only one economic equilibrium .",
    "labour serves as numraire , so @xmath24 .",

    "we suppose that our economy has reached a fixed point if these `` economic '' variables do not change any more over time .",

    "however , in this section we only examine economic equilibria in the same sense as for the previous model versions , i.e. we suppose the economy to be in equilibrium if @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and then we are interested in whether these points are fixed points in the economic space ( as defined above ) and whether there are other fixed points .",
    "economic equilibria can then be derived as follows .",
    "the household s utility maximisation subject to its budget constraint yields a maximum at @xmath111 ( see section [ s : household2 ] ) .",
    "necessary condition for an economic equilibrium is @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath113 for a temporarily stable equilibrium , however , also @xmath114 has to hold ( otherwise the household would change its labour supply and jelly demand for the next time step ) , that means for the equilibrium labour supply @xmath94 @xmath115 for the respective planned jelly demand @xmath116 then @xmath117 setting @xmath118 yields for the ( temporarily stable ) economic equilibrium wage - to - price ratio @xmath119 depending on @xmath120 there might be other economic equilibria if @xmath121 but ( [ e : moneywpe ] ) holds for the ones that are stable over time .      in the extended model ,",
    "there is one more market and one more price ( with the respective expectation - and - updating routine by the firm ) and thus the resulting dynamics of the system becomes more complex .",
    "a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this paper and will be subject of further research . however , some similarities and differences to the previous cases are pointed out in the following .",
    "a couple of propositions have been made about the dynamics of the original model .",
    "for the extended model , first simulations suggest that the same types of fixed points can be found for the extended model , so it seems that proposition [ p : types ] applies for the extended model as well .",
    "however , there is a fundamental difference between the extended model and the previous cases : equations ( [ e : le])-([e : wpe ] ) determine a single point in the economic space but equations ( [ e : moneyle])-([e : moneywpe ] ) an infinite set of points , i.e. for the previous cases the economic equilibrium is a single point in the economic space but for the extended model it is a larger set .",
    "the set of economic equilibria can also lie partly in the viable region , as depicted in figure [ f : statespacemoney ] .",
    ", width=188 ]    this can be illustrated e.g. reformulating proposition [ p : minmoney ] for the extended model .",
    "this proposition states that ( for the previous case with money ) it is a necessary condition for the economic equilibrium that there is a minimum total amount of money @xmath122 in the system . for the extended model",
    "the respective minimum amount of money would be @xmath123 ( there has to be enough money for paying the equilibrium income plus the amount the household keeps under the mattress ) , i.e. it depends on the wage level , whether the necessary condition for the total amount of money is fulfilled or not .    of course , here we defined the economic equilibrium only by clearing labour and jelly markets while not paying attention to the money market .",
    "the full analysis of the three goods case ( jelly , labour , money ) is beyond the scope of this paper , and will pursued in future work .",
    "but the findings of this paper already suggest that this analysis will focus on the question what kind of monetary policies make economic equilibria viable .",
    "it is an open question in economic theory how to extend the mathematical model of general equilibrium theory to include price adjustments . removing the fictitious auctioneer from canonical arrow - debreu framework raises the question of how prices are set and adjusted by decentralised actors with incomplete information .    in this paper",
    ", we considered a very basic model with only two aggregate agents , a household and a firm .",
    "the firm sets the prices .",
    "it compensates for the lack of information about the households demand using expectations about that .",
    "it improves its expectations about the household s demand by observing the household reactions to past prices .",
    "we investigated the dynamics of this system with respect to the question whether the economic equilibrium is obtained eventually .",
    "we found that it is essential for such a system that value can be stored over time .",
    "for this purpose , it seems to be natural to introduce money to the modelled economy , but this raises questions about if and to which degree , money is a commodity of its own , and how to determine supply and demand for it .",
    "one main point of this paper is that we look at the trajectories of the system in what we call the economic space , i.e. a projection of the state space onto the `` economic '' state variables : supplies , demands , and prices . while the system is deterministic , evolution in the economic space",
    "is not ( i.e. only knowing the `` economic '' variables does not suffice to predict the future development ) .",
    "but statements can be made about which parts of the economic space are allowed for evolution , and the system s `` freedom '' to evolve over time is strongly to connected to the availability of money to the agents .",
    "the task to model an out - of - equilibrium price dynamics based on expectations brought up the need for money in the system `` naturally '' .",
    "therefore , we consider this paper as a first step towards modelling an out - of - equilibrium economy with money and ( at least ) two other commodities .",
    "various discussions with andreas geiges and franziska schtze have been very useful and are highly acknowledged , as well as valuable programming support by steffen frst .",
