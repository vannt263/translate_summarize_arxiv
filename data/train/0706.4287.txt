    "less than two decades ago , dyakonov @xcite theoretically predicted the propagation of a surface wave at the planar interface of an isotropic dielectric material and a positively uniaxial dielectric material with its optic axis wholly parallel to the interface plane .",
    "if @xmath0 indicates the angle between the optic axis and the direction of surface  wave propagation , and @xmath1 is the refractive index of the isotropic dielectric material , then the _ dyakonov wave",
    "_ exists for rather narrow ranges of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the consequent significance of dyakonov waves for optical sensing and waveguiding was recognized thereafter @xcite . since then",
    ", the concept of the dyakonov wave has been extended to the planar interfaces of isotropic and biaxial dielectric materials @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the anisotropic material being artificially engineered , either as a photonic crystal with a short period in comparison to the wavelength @xcite or as a columnar thin film ( ctf ) @xcite , has also emerged .",
    "let us note here that the dyakonov wave still remains to be experimentally observed , in part due to the narrow range of @xmath0 for its existence @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic material is taken to be homogeneous in all of the foregoing and other reports on the dyakonov wave .",
    "what if the anisotropic material were to be chosen as periodically nonhomogeneous in a direction normal to the bimaterial interface ?",
    "this question initiated a research project , the first results of which are being communicated here .",
    "being a natural extension of a ctf , a chiral sculptured thin film ( stf ) was chosen as the periodically nonhomogeneous anisotropic material @xcite .",
    "a chiral stf is made by directing a vapor flux in vacuum at an oblique angle onto a rotating substrate .",
    "under suitable conditions , an assembly of parallel nanohelixes of the evaporated species forms , with the helical axes perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "an example of a single nanohelix is illustrated in figure  [ fig : chistf ] . by adjusting deposition parameters ,",
    "both the pitch @xmath2 and the angle of inclination @xmath3 $ ] can be controlled .",
    "each nanohelix , composed of multimolecular clusters with @xmath4  nm diameter , is effectively a continuously bent column of @xmath5-nm cross  sectional diameter .",
    "therefore , at visible frequencies and lower , a chiral stf may be regarded as a linear , locally orthorhombic , unidirectionally nonhomogeneous continuum whose relative permittivity dyadic is akin to that of chiral smectic liquid crystals @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     calculations were also made at @xmath6 and @xmath7  nm , with the assumption of the same constitutive and geometric parameters as at @xmath8  nm .",
    "qualitatively similar conclusions on the width of the ranges of @xmath1 and @xmath0 for dyakonov ",
    "tamm waves were drawn from the numerical results obtained .",
    "furthermore , the minimum value of @xmath9 was found to increase and the maximum values of @xmath10 $ ] , @xmath11 $ ] , and @xmath12 $ ] were found to decrease , as the ratio @xmath13 increases .",
    "additional calculations , not shown here , were made for an identical chiral stf except with structural left ",
    "handedness ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the exact same results were obtained with the left  handed chiral stf as with the right  handed chiral stf presented in figures  24 .",
    "it must borne in mind that , by changing @xmath15 from @xmath16 to @xmath17 in ( [ szdyadic ] ) , we invert not only the structural handedness of the chiral stf but also the sense of rotation brought about by @xmath18 .",
    "to conclude , we examined the phenomenon of surface  wave propagation at the planar interface of an isotropic dielectric material and a chiral sculptured thin film .",
    "the boundary  value problem was formulated by marrying the usual formalism for the dyakonov wave at the planar interface of an isotropic dielectric material and a columnar thin film with the methodology for tamm states in solid  state physics .",
    "the solution of the boundary  value problem let us deduce the existence of dyakonov ",
    "tamm waves .    in constitutive terms ,",
    "the major difference between a ctf and a chiral stf is the periodic nonhomogeneity enshrined in @xmath19 ; in the limit @xmath20 , a nanohelix uncurls into a nanorod , and a chiral stf transmutes into a ctf .",
    "however , the distinction between chiral stfs and ctfs is nontrivial , as may be deduced from the floquet ",
    "lyapunov theorem @xcite . in comparison to the dyakonov wave localized to the planar interface of an isotropic dielectric material and a ctf @xcite",
    ", we found that the @xmath1range for the existence of a dyakonov ",
    "tamm wave at the planar interface of an isotropic dielectric material and a chiral stf is smaller .",
    "however , the @xmath0range is much larger in width : in comparison to @xmath21 with ctfs @xcite    and @xmath22 with effectively uniaxial , short ",
    "period photonic crystals @xcite    the width of the @xmath0range is as high as @xmath23 in figure  [ fig : vbarlambda633 ] with chiral stfs .",
    "this implies that dyakonov ",
