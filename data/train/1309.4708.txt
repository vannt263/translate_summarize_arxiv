    "[ sec : intro ] in the studies of necessary conditions for singular minimizers containing surfaces of gradient discontinuity various local jump conditions have been proposed .",
    "a partial list of such conditions include weierstrass - erdmann relations ( traction continuity and maxwell condition ) @xcite , quasi - convexity on phase boundary @xcite , grinfeld instability condition @xcite and roughening instability condition @xcite .",
    "while some of these conditions have been known for a long time , a systematic study of their _ interdependence _ have not been conducted , and a full understanding of which conditions are primary and which are derivative is still missing .",
    "the absence of hierarchy is mostly due to the fact that strong and weak local minima have to be treated differently and that variations leading to some of the known necessary conditions represent an intricate _ combination _ of strong and weak perturbations . in particular , if the goal is to find local necessary conditions of a _ strong local minimum _ , the use of weak variations gives rise to redundant information .",
    "for instance , euler - lagrange equations in the weak form should not be a part of the minimal ( essential ) local description of strong local minima .    in this paper , we study strong local minimizers and our goal is to derive an _",
    "irreducible _ set of necessary conditions at a point of discontinuity by using only `` purely '' strong variations of the interface that are complementary to the known strong variations at nonsingular points @xcite .",
    "more specifically , our main theorem states that all known local conditions associated with gradient discontinuities follow from quasi - convexity on both sides of the discontinuity plus a single interface inequality which we call the _ interchange stability _ condition . while this condition is fully explicit and deceptively simple , to the knowledge of the authors , it has not been specifically singled out , except for a cursory mention by r. hill @xcite of the corresponding _ equality _ which we call _ elastic normality condition_. to emphasize a relation between this condition and strong variations we show that it is responsible for gteaux differentiability of the energy functional along special multiscale `` directions '' .",
    "we call them _ material interchange _ variations and show that they are devoid of any weak components .",
    "we also explain why the elastic normality condition , which r. hill associated exclusively with weak variations , plays such an important role in the study of strong local minima .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : prelim ] we introduce the interchange stability condition and formulate our main result . in section  [ sec : norm ]",
    "we link interchange stability with a strong variation which we interpret as material exchange .",
    "we then interpolate between this strong variation and a special weak variation which independently produces the normality condition .",
    "our main theorem is proved in section  [ sec : proof ] , where we also establish the inter - dependencies between the known local necessary conditions of strong local minimum .",
    "an illustrative example of locally stable interfaces associated with simple laminates is discussed in detail in section  [ sec : ex ] . in section  [ sec : normality ] we build a link between the notions of elastic and plastic normality and show in which sense the elastic normality condition can be interpreted as the actual orthogonality with respect to an appropriately defined `` yield '' surface .",
    "we then illustrate the general construction by studying the case of an anti - plane shear in isotropic material with a double - well energy .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] consider the variational functional most readily associated with continuum elasticity theory @xmath0 here @xmath1 is an open subset of @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the neumann part of the boundary .",
    "we can absorb the boundary integral into the volume integral by finding a divergence - free @xmath4 matrix field @xmath5 , such that @xmath6 on @xmath3 which suggests that the variational functional @xmath7 can be used in place of ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath8 is a continuous and bounded from below function on @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the set of all @xmath4 matrices .",

    "we further assume that @xmath26 which imposes kinematic compatibility constraint on the jump of the deformation gradient @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a called a shear vector .",
    "material stability of the deformation @xmath30 at point @xmath31 is understood as stability with respect to local variations of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the unit ball can be supported in any bounded domain of @xmath2 , see @xcite ] . the corresponding energy variation @xmath34",
    "is defined by @xmath35 the condition of material stability can be written in different forms for points where @xmath16 is continuous and for points on jump discontinuity where @xmath16 satisfies ( [ fpmdef ] ) .",
    "the condition of material stability in the regular point is obtained by changing variables @xmath36 in ( [ strvar ] ) , @xcite @xmath37 to be closer to standard notations we redefine @xmath38 and write the necessary condition of material stability in the form of quasi - convexity condition @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the average over @xmath33 .",
    "we say that @xmath41 is _ strongly locally stable _ if @xmath42 for any @xmath43 .",
    "when the point @xmath31 lies at the jump discontinuity we can again change variables @xmath36 and write @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is defined in ( [ fpmdef ] ) .",
    "the associated necessary condition can be then written in the form of quasiconvexity on the surface of jump discontinuity condition @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "we say that the pair @xmath48 satisfying ( [ kincomp ] ) determines a _ strongly locally stable interface _",
    "@xmath49 if @xmath50 for any @xmath43 .",
    "it is clear that the strong local stability of the interface @xmath51 implies strong local stability ( [ qcx ] ) of @xmath52 and @xmath53",

    "it is then clear that @xmath41 is strongly locally stable if and only if @xmath60 .",
    "similarly we say that the pair @xmath61 satisfying ( [ kincomp ] ) determines a strongly locally stable interface if @xmath62 solves the localized variational problem @xmath63 where we defined a lipschitz continuous function @xmath64    we are now in a position to formulate our main claim that strong local stability ( [ qcx ] ) of @xmath61 together with a single additional condition , which we call interchange stability , implies strong local stability of the interface :    [ th : main ] let @xmath58 be a continuous , bounded from below function that is of class @xmath65 in a neighborhood  of @xmath66 .",
    "assume that the pair @xmath61 satisfies the kinematic compatibility condition @xmath67 for some @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "then the surface of jump discontinuity @xmath70 is strongly locally stable if and only if the following conditions are satisfied :    * material stability in the bulk : @xmath71 , * interchange stability : @xmath72 .    before we turn to the proof of theorem  [ th : main ] it is instructive to look closely at the meaning of the scalar quantity @xmath73 entering the algebraic condition ( @xmath74 )",
    "[ sec : norm ]    while it is natural that condition ( [ jdqcx ] ) of strong local stability of the interface implies strong local stability of each individual deformation gradient @xmath52 and @xmath53 , a less obvious claim of theorem  [ th : main ] is that the only _ joint _ stability constraint on the kinematically compatible pair @xmath75 is provided by condition ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "a natural challenge is then to identify the variation producing this condition .",
    "we observe that conventional variations , linking both sides of a jump discontinuity and leading to maxwell condition @xcite or roughening instability condition @xcite , represent combinations of weak and strong variations .",
    "this creates unnecessary coupling and obscures the strong character of the minimizer under consideration .",
    "physically it is clear that if  materials  on both sides of the interface are stable and if we can interchange one  material  by another without increasing the energy , then the whole configuration should be stable .     between the original and perturbed normals is plotted as a function of length in the tangential direction . ]",
    "the idea of material interchange is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : interchange ] where the two adjacent rectangular domains are flipped and then translated . at @xmath76",
    "this construction can be viewed as a interface generalization of the weierstrass `` needle variation '' since neither the fields are modified , except on a set of zero surface area . as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : normalnuc ] this variation can be also interpreted as a strong variation of the interface normal .",
    "notice that if taken literally , the schematics of perturbed field shown in fig .  [ fig : interchange ] is incompatible with a gradient of any admissible variation . to fix this technical problem we present below an explicit construction of the variation",

    "we remark that the variation ( [ wdipole ] ) belongs to the class of multiscale variations proposed in @xcite : it uses a small scale @xmath95 and another small scale @xmath96 from ( [ strong ] ) .",
    "the interpretation of the function @xmath73 as an `` interchange driving force '' is immediately clear from the following theorem :    [ th : wdipole0 ] suppose @xmath66 satisfy ( [ kincomp ] ) .",

    "in fact all points on the jump set are `` marginally stable '' and detectable through the nucleation of an infinite layer in an infinite space @xcite .",
    "it follows that the existence of a strongly locally stable interface has significant consequences for the geometry of @xmath248 .",
    "the presence of stable interfaces implies that a part of the jump set must coincide with a part of the `` binodal '' , the boundary of @xmath248 .",
    "the rank-1 lines joining @xmath52 and @xmath53 , both of which lie on the binodal , cover the simple lamination region @xmath276 .",
    "[ sec : normality ] in this section we show that the algebraic equation @xmath277 interpreted above as condition of interchange equilibrium , is conceptually similar to the well known _ normality condition _ in plasticity theory @xcite .    to build a link between the two frameworks",
    "we now show that a microstructure  in elasticity theory plays the role of a `` mechanism '' in plasticity theory .",
    "consider a loading program with affine dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath278 .",
    "suppose that @xmath279 for an interval of values of the loading parameter @xmath153 .",
    "then , for every @xmath153 the deformation gradient @xmath280 will be accommodated by a laminate ( [ ymsol ] ) , so that @xmath281    we now interpret the representation ( [ ldprog ] ) from the point of view of plasticity theory . while the deformations associated with the change of @xmath52 and @xmath53 in each layer of the laminate are elastic , the deformation associated with the change of parameter @xmath153 , affecting the microstructure  and modifying the young measure @xmath282 , can be regarded as `` inelastic '' .",
    "in fact , it is similar to lattice invariant shear characterizing elementary slip in crystal plasticity theory . to be more specific",
    ", we can decompose the strain rate @xmath283 as follows @xmath284 where @xmath285 is the elastic strain rate and @xmath286 is the `` plastic '' strain rate .",
    "next we notice that in equilibrium the `` inelastic '' strain rate @xmath287 defines an _ affine _ direction along the quasiconvex envelope of the energy ( see lemma  [ lem : rwformula ] ) .",
    "this suggests that there is a stress plateau with which one can associate a notion of the `` yield '' stress @xcite .    to find an equation for the corresponding `` yield surface '' we choose a special loading path where the elastic fields in the layers do not change @xmath288 .",
    "then , differentiating ( [ rwformula ] ) in @xmath153 , we find that the total stress field @xmath289 lies on the hyperplane @xmath290 which we interpret as the `` yield surface '' associated with `` plastic '' mechanism @xmath291 .",
    "if we now rewrite our elastic normality condition @xmath156 in the form @xmath292 it becomes apparent that the `` plastic '' strain rate @xmath286 is orthogonal to the yield surface @xmath293 .    to strengthen the analogy we observe that in plasticity theory the yield surface marks the set of minimally stable elastic states @xcite . in elastic framework",
    "the states @xmath61 adjacent to the jump discontinuity are also only marginally stable , see remark  [ rem : marg ] .",
    "the fact that in elasticity setting the normality condition appears as a part of energy _",
    "minimization _ while in plasticity theory it is usually derived by maximizing plastic _ dissipation _ , is secondary in view of the implied rate independent nature of plastic dissipation @xcite .",
    "the analogy between elastic and plastic normality conditions becomes more transparent if we consider a simple example .",
    "suppose that our material is isotropic and the deformation is anti - plane shear .",
    "take the energy density in the form @xmath294 where @xmath295and the shear moduli of the `` phases '' @xmath296 are positive .        in this scalar example",
    "the quasiconvex and convex envelopes of the energy density coincide , and hence we can write ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : aps ] ) @xmath297 \\dfrac{\\mu_{-}}{2}|\\bf|^{2}+w_{-},&\\text { if } |\\bf|\\ge{\\varepsilon}_{-}\\\\[3ex ]    \\text { if } { \\varepsilon}_{+}\\le|\\bf|\\le{\\varepsilon}_{-}.    \\end{array}\\right.,\\ ] ] where @xmath298 observe also that the binodal region @xmath299 coincides with the simple laminate region @xmath251 since for @xmath300 the gradient young measures @xmath301 attain the infimum in ( [ homloc ] ) .        by fixing @xmath52 on the circle @xmath302",
    "we then obtain the unique @xmath303 which furnishes the `` plastic '' mechanism @xmath291 .",
    "the associated `` yield plane '' @xmath293 can be written explicitly @xmath304 we observe that as @xmath52 is varied over the circle @xmath305 , the yield lines @xmath293 form an envelope of the circle @xmath306 in stress space ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : env ] ) , which is the image of the binodal @xmath307 under the map @xmath308 .",
    "since the stress in each phase of the laminate is always the same @xmath309 we can write @xmath310 thus , in an arbitrary loading program the total stress @xmath311 will be confined to the yield surface envelope @xmath312 , provided @xmath313 .",
    "two cautionary notes are in order .",
    "first , in contrast with conventional plasticity theory , the regions of stress space both inside and outside of the `` yield '' surface @xmath312 are elastic .",
    "this distinguishes our `` transformational plasticity '' where hysteresis is infinitely narrow , from the classical plasticity where hysteresis is essential .",
    "such geometric picture continue to hold as long as @xmath314 , in particular , it holds for all scalar problems ( @xmath315 ) .",
    "the second observation is that for @xmath316 , our `` hardening free '' plastic analogy breaks down because the total stress in an arbitrary loading program is no longer confined to any surface . in this case",
    "the `` plastic '' mechanism operates on a set of full measure and the proposed analogy requires a generalization .",
