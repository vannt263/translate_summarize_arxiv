    "with dense deployment of distributed access points known as remote radio heads ( rrhs ) under the coordination of a central unit ( cu ) , cloud radio access network ( c - ran ) has been envisioned as a promising candidate for the fifth - generation ( 5 g ) wireless networks in future @xcite .",
    "unlike the base station ( bs ) in the traditional cellular networks which encodes or decodes the user messages locally , in c - ran each rrh merely forwards the signals of wireless users from / to the cu via a high - speed fronthaul link ( fiber or wireless ) in the downlink and uplink communications , respectively , while leaving the joint encoding / decoding complexity to a baseband unit ( bbu ) in the cu .",
    "the centralized baseband processing at the cu enables enormous spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency gains for c - ran over conventional cellular networks .    despite the theoretical performance gains , the practically achievable throughput of c - ran",
    "is largely constrained by the finite - capacity fronthaul links between the rrhs and the cu . in the literature",
    ", a considerable amount of effort has been dedicated to study effective techniques to reduce the fronthaul capacity required in both the uplink and downlink communications in c - ran . in the uplink communication ,",
    "the so - called `` quantize - and - forward ( qf ) '' scheme is proposed to reduce the communication rates between the cu and rrhs , where each rrh samples , quantizes and forwards its received wireless signals to the cu over its fronthaul link with a given capacity @xcite @xcite . in the downlink communication , besides the qf scheme @xcite , the cu can more efficiently send the user messages to each rrh directly over its fronthaul link , which then encodes the user messages into wireless signals and transmits them to users @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this scheme , user - rrh association is crucial to the performance of c - ran since in general the cu can only send the messages for a subset of users to each rrh due to the limited capacity of each fronthaul link .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the downlink communication in a c - ran consisting of multi - antenna rrhs and single - antenna users , where user messages are sent from cu to distributed rrhs via individual fronthaul links for coordinated transmission , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . by jointly designing the beamforming at all rrhs and user - rrh associations",
    ", we aim to maximize the minimum signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) of all users subject to each rrh s individual transmit power constraint as well as fronthaul capacity constraint .",
    "it is worth noting that without the fronthaul capacity constraints , each user can be served by all the rrhs and the resulted beamforming problem for sinr balancing has been solved in @xcite , @xcite by utilizing bisection method jointly with conic optimization techniques @xcite .",
    "however , with the newly introduced fronthaul constraints , the joint optimization of beamforming and user association results in a combinatorial problem , which is np - hard and thus difficult to be optimally solved in a network with large number of users and rrhs . in this paper , we propose a new method for practically solving this problem , which effectively decouples the design of rrh beamforming and user - rrh association , thus achieving significant complexity reduction .",
    "specifically , we first associate each user to all rrhs , and then iteratively reduce the number of users served by each rrh until the corresponding optimal beamforming solution given this user association solution satisfies all the rrhs fronthaul capacity constraints . a monotonic convergence is proved for the proposed iterative algorithm , and numerical results show that its performance is significantly better as compared to other heuristic solutions , especially when the fronthaul capacity is more stringent .",
    "this paper studies the downlink communication in c - ran , as shown in fig .",
    "the studied system consists of one cu , @xmath0 rrhs , denoted by the set @xmath1 , and @xmath2 users , denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "it is assumed that each rrh is equipped with @xmath4 antennas , while each user is equipped with one single antenna .",
    "it is further assumed that each rrh @xmath5 is connected to the cu via a fronthaul link with a capacity of @xmath6 bits per second ( bps ) . in the downlink",
    ", the cu sends the user messages and corresponding quantized beamforming vectors to each rrh via its fronthaul link .",
    "then , each rrh upconverts the digital messages into wireless signals and sends them to the users .",
    "the details are given as follows .",
    "it is assumed that the @xmath0 rrhs communicate with the @xmath2 users over quasi - static flat - fading channels over a given bandwidth of @xmath7 hz .",
    "the equivalent baseband transmit signal of rrh @xmath5 is @xmath8where @xmath9 denotes the message intended for user @xmath10 , which is modeled as a circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) random variable with zero - mean and unit - variance , and @xmath11 denotes rrh @xmath5 s beamforming vector for user @xmath10 .",
    "suppose that rrh @xmath5 has a transmit sum - power constraint @xmath12 ; from ( [ eqn : transmit signal scheme 1 ] ) , we thus have @xmath13=\\sum_{k=1}^k\\|{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$ w $ } } } _ { k , n}\\|^2\\leq \\bar{p}_n$ ] , @xmath14 .    then , the received signal of user @xmath10 can be expressed as @xmath15where @xmath16 denotes the channel from rrh @xmath5 to user @xmath10 , and @xmath17 denotes the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) at user @xmath10 . in this paper",
    ", it is assumed that the channels to all the @xmath2 users are perfectly known at the cu .",
    "the decoding sinr for user @xmath10 is thus expressed as @xmath18then , the achievable rate of user @xmath10 in bps is given by @xmath19    next , consider the data transmission from the cu to rrhs over their fronthaul links .",
    "it is worth noting that if @xmath20 , then user @xmath10 is served by rrh @xmath5 ; otherwise , user @xmath10 is not served by rrh @xmath5 . as a result",
    ", we can define the user association indicator function @xmath21 as follows : @xmath22if user @xmath10 is served by rrh @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath23 , the cu needs to send the digital messages @xmath24 to rrh @xmath5 over its fronthaul link at a rate of @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 bps ; otherwise , the cu does not need to send @xmath24 to rrh @xmath5 . as a result , the fronthaul capacity constraint of rrh @xmath5 can be expressed as @xmath27",
    "in this paper , we aim to design the beamforming vectors at all rrhs , i.e. , @xmath28 s , which also indicate the user association solution , i.e. , @xmath21 s according to ( [ eqn : user association ] ) , to maximize the minimum sinr of all the users subject to each rrh s transmit power constraint as well as its fronthaul capacity constraint . specifically , we consider the following sinr balancing problem .",
    "@xmath29it is worth noting that without the fronthaul capacity constraints given in ( [ eqn : constraint 3 ] ) , each user should be served by all the rrhs , i.e. , @xmath23 , @xmath30 , and the optimal beamforming solution can be efficiently obtained @xcite , @xcite .",
    "specifically , given any sinr target @xmath31 , we need to check whether there exists at least one beamforming solution to satisfy constraints ( [ eqn : constraint 1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : constraint 2 ] ) .",
    "this feasibility problem can be transformed into a second - order cone programming ( socp ) that can be efficiently solved @xcite . then based on",
    "whether such a feasible beamforming solution can be found or not with each given @xmath31 , the bisection method @xcite can be applied to let @xmath31 iteratively converge to the optimal sinr solution @xmath32 to problem ( p1 ) .",
    "however , with the newly introduced fronthaul capacity constraints given in ( [ eqn : constraint 3 ] ) , in general each rrh can not support all the users in the downlink transmission , and as a result , from ( [ eqn : user association ] ) , for each rrh @xmath5 , only a subset of users are associated with it , for which the corresponding user association function @xmath21 and beamforming vector @xmath28 are non - zero .",
    "therefore , the rrh beamforming and user - rrh association need to be jointly optimized in ( p1 ) .",
    "however , due to the coupling between beamforming and user association given in ( [ eqn : user association ] ) , problem ( p1 ) is np - hard and thus difficult to be optimally solved by exhaustive search of all possible user - rrh associations ( which has the complexity of @xmath33 ) , especially in a network with large number of users and/or rrhs . to the best knowledge of the authors ,",
    "problem ( p1 ) has not been efficiently solved in the literature .",
    "in this section , we propose a new algorithm to efficiently solve problem ( p1 ) , which obtains a suboptimal solution in general .",
    "first , we have the following proposition .",
    "[ proposition1 ] there always exists an optimal solution to problem ( p1 ) such that all the users achieve the same sinr . as a result ,",
    "problem ( p1 ) is equivalent to the following problem .",
    "@xmath34    please refer to appendix [ appendix1 ] .",
    "notice that in ( p2 ) , comparing the constraint in ( [ eqn : constraint 5 ] ) with that given by ( [ eqn : constraint 3 ] ) in ( p1 ) , individual user sinr @xmath35 is replaced by the user common sinr @xmath32 without loss of optimality . as explained in section [ sec : problem formulation ] , the main difficulty to solve ( p2 ) lies in the coupled rrh beamforming design and user - rrh association through ( [ eqn : user association ] ) . hence , in the following , we propose a new method to solve problem ( p2 ) by decoupling the designs of user association and beamforming . in brief , we first allow each user to be served by all the rrhs , i.e. , @xmath23 , @xmath30 , and then iteratively remove an active user - rrh association with a selected user and rrh pair until the fronthaul capacity constraints of all rrhs are satisfied in ( [ eqn : constraint 5 ] ) .    specifically , the proposed algorithm iterates as follows until convergence . in the @xmath36th iteration , with @xmath37 , define @xmath38 as the set of users served by rrh @xmath5 . at start , we have @xmath39 , @xmath14 .",
    "in other words , each user is served by all the rrhs initially .",
    "next , we solve problem ( p2 ) at the @xmath36th iteration with a given user association solution @xmath40 if @xmath41 , and @xmath23 if @xmath42 , by solving the following problem .",
    "@xmath43where @xmath44 denotes the cardinality of set @xmath45 . for convenience ,",
    "we denote problem ( p2,t ) without fronthaul constraints ( [ eqn : constraint 7 ] ) as problem ( p2 - 1,t ) .",
    "this problem can be efficiently solved similarly to problem ( p1 ) without the fronthaul constraints ( [ eqn : constraint 3 ] ) as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath46 s and @xmath47 denote the optimal solution and optimal value of problem ( p2 - 1,t ) , respectively .    then , consider problem ( p2,t ) only with the fronthaul constraints ( [ eqn : constraint 7 ] ) , which is denoted as problem ( p2 - 2,t ) .",

    "the only remaining problem for the proposed algorithm is how to select a wireless link to shut down in each iteration , i.e. , how to update @xmath66 s from @xmath38 s . according to proposition [ proposition2 ] , to converge to a max - min sinr as large as possible , it is wise to shut down wireless links in a way such that @xmath47 decreases slowly with @xmath36 , but @xmath49 increases rapidly with @xmath36 . in the following ,",
    "we propose a practical method to update @xmath38 s based on the above idea .",
    "it can be observed from ( [ eqn : opt 1 ] ) that to increase the value of @xmath49 in each iteration , one wireless link associated with the rrh with the smallest value of @xmath67 should be shut down .",
