    "current ideas about the formation of gmcs present a nagging puzzle .",
    "some authors have suggested that gmcs form by agglomeration of pre - existing molecular clouds ( e.g. scoville & hersh 1979 ; kwan & valdes 1983 ) .",
    "others have argued that gmcs form primarily from atomic gas through some sort of instability or large - scale shock ( e.g. woodward 1976 ; blitz & shu 1980 ; engargiola , et al .",
    "2003 ) . in principle",
    ", both modes may occur : in galaxies that are predominantly atomic , gmcs might form by one process , and in galaxies that are primarily molecular , the gmcs might form by another .",
    "if so , two different gmc formation mechanisms could be at work in the same galaxy because many galaxies show a transition from being predominantly molecular at their centers to being predominantly atomic in their outer parts ( e.g. wong & blitz 2002 ; helfer et al .",
    "for example , in the outer parts of spiral galaxies there is so little molecular gas ( e.g. dame et al .",
    "1987 ; dame 1993 ; heyer et al .",
    "1998 ) that making gmcs from atomic gas seems to be the only available formation pathway . on the other hand ,",
    "the centers of many galaxies are so overwhelmingly molecular ( e.g. mauersberger et al . 1989 ; young et al . 1995 ; wong & blitz 2002 , helfer et al . 2003 ) that it is implausible for the inner galaxy molecular clouds to form from anything other than pre - existing molecular gas .",
    "the stars in these galaxies form only from molecular gas , yet there is no obvious change in the star forming properties across the molecular / atomic transition region .",
    "how could it be that molecular clouds that form by two independent processes would show no obvious difference in their star formation properties ?",
    "one possibility is that the process of cloud formation is independent of whether the preexisting gas is atomic or molecular .",
    "that is , the ratio of atomic / molecular gas depends on some other factor , such as the ambient pressure . because the rate of star formation depends only on the amount of molecular gas @xcite , whatever determines the molecular gas surface density , determines the variation of star formation within a galaxy .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the hypothesis that the molecular gas fraction in a galaxy disk is determined by the mean hydrostatic pressure at a particular radius .",
    "we show that if the hydrostatic pressure is the only parameter determining the molecular gas fraction , one predicts that the radius at which the atomic and molecular gas surface densities are the same , the transition radius , occurs at a constant value of the _ stellar _ surface density , @xmath3 .",
    "remarkably , in a sample of 28 galaxies , @xmath3 is found to be constant to about 40% at the transition radius , even though the observed variation of @xmath3 in these galaxies is at least 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "several authors have previously suggested that gas pressure determines the molecular fraction at a given radius in a galaxy .",
    "spergel & blitz ( 1992 ) , for example , argued that the extraordinarily large molecular gas fraction at the center of the milky way is plausibly the result of the very high hydrostatic pressure in the galactic bulge .",
    "elmegreen ( 1993 ) suggested on theoretical grounds that the ratio of atomic to molecular gas in galactic disks results from both the ambient hydrostatic pressure as well as the mean radiation field .",
    "the dependence on the pressure is steeper than that of the radiation density ( @xmath4 ) and ought to be the dominant factor .",
    "observationally , wong and blitz ( 2002 ) showed that the radial dependence of the atomic to molecular gas ratio in seven molecule rich galactic disks can be understood to be the result of the variation in interstellar hydrostatic pressure ( with @xmath5 ) .",
    "let us assume , therefore , that @xmath6(h@xmath2)/@xmath6 ( ) , the ratio of h@xmath2 column density to  column density , is determined _ only _ by the midplane hydrostatic pressure , @xmath7 .",
    "in an infinite disk with isothermal stellar and gas layers , and where the gas scale height is much less than the stellar scale height , as is typical in disk galaxies , to first order :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the total surface density of the gas , @xmath10 is the velocity dispersion of the gas , @xmath11 is the midplane surface density of stars , and @xmath12 is the midplane surface density of gas . the first term on the right is due to the hydrostatic pressure of the gas in the stellar potential ; the second term is due to the self - gravity of the gas .    in most galaxy disks , @xmath11 is much larger than @xmath12 when averaged over azimuth , except in the far outer parts of a galaxy where the stars become quite rare . in the solar vicinity , for example , @xmath11 = 0.1 m@xmath13 pc@xmath14 ( e.g. binney & merrifield 1998 ) , but @xmath15 0.02 m@xmath13 pc@xmath14 ( e.g. dame 1993 ) . for a self - gravitating stellar disk , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the stellar scale height and @xmath18 .",
    "thus , neglecting @xmath12 , equation 1 becomes :    @xmath19    where @xmath9 is the total surface density of the gas , @xmath10 is the velocity dispersion of the gas , @xmath11 is the midplane surface density of stars , and @xmath12 is the midplane surface density of gas . direct solution of the fluid equations by numerical integration shows that this approximation is accurate to 10% for @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 ) , which covers the range of stellar surface densities in this study .    we choose to express the midplane pressure in the form of equation [ approxpressure ] since there is good evidence that both @xmath17 and @xmath10 are constant with radius in disk galaxies .",
    "furthermore , because of the weak dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath17 , and the small variation of @xmath17 measured among galactic disks , we expect variations of @xmath17 to have little effect on @xmath7 .",
    "the constancy of the stellar scale height within galaxies was demonstrated by @xcite and has been confirmed in other edge - on galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while there is some evidence that the stellar scale height flares at large radius in some galaxies @xcite , this is only found only at the edges of stellar disks in regions where the stellar , gaseous and dark matter components of the disk make comparable contributions to the potential .",
    "adopting a constant stellar scale height is further supported by the observations of @xcite , who shows that the stellar velocity dispersion follows an exponential distribution with scale length twice that of the stellar surface density in disks .",
    "this observation suggests that the stellar disk is distributed vertically in a sech@xmath22 profile with @xmath23 .",
    "while the stellar component of galactic disks can be approximated with a constant scale height , the gas component is better described by a constant velocity dispersion , @xmath24 , which is observed in face - on galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the milky way @xcite . the milky way observations show that the gas scale height decreases as the stellar surface mass density increases in a manner consistent the gas remaining isothermal @xcite .",
    "this ensemble of observations suggests that @xmath25 km s@xmath26 characterizes the velocity dispersion in the stellar dominated regions of galactic disks .    by assumption , @xmath27    thus , since @xmath28 is approximately constant within galaxies , then    @xmath29\\ ] ]    the mass surface density of atomic gas , @xmath30 , is reasonably constant across the inner portions of galactic disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while some changes of @xmath30 with radius are observed , the variation is small compared to the changes observed in stellar surface mass density and molecular surface mass density .",
    "we may therefore adopt a single value for the surface density of atomic gas in a galaxy across the stellar disk .",
    "@xmath6 ( ) saturates at a value of about @xmath31 cm@xmath1@xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath6(h@xmath2)/@xmath6 ( ) has a value of unity when 2@xmath6(h@xmath2)@xmath33 ( ) has a value of @xmath34 cm@xmath1 .",
    "equation [ approxpressure ] , therefore implies that the radius where the atomic and molecular surface densities are equal in spiral galaxies depends only on @xmath3 if @xmath10/@xmath17 is constant .",
    "we use bima song @xcite , an interferometric imaging survey of the co in 44 nearby spirals , to determine the distribution of the molecular gas . to determine the h@xmath2 surface density",
    ", we use a conversion factor of @xmath6(h@xmath2)/@xmath35(co)@xmath36 . for the",
    ", we adopted a single value that characterizes the column density across the galactic disk .",
    "these values were drawn from maps of galaxies reported in the literature . adopted values and the corresponding references",
    "appear in table [ h1src ] along with the orientation parameters and distances used in @xcite .",
    "if no observations have been reported for the galaxies , we used a value of 8 @xmath37 , which corresponds to a surface density of @xmath31 cm@xmath1 , typical for the stellar disks of galaxies .",
    ".[h1src]adopted galactic parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     the stellar surface densities are determined using reduced @xmath38-band images from the 2mass large galaxy atlas @xcite .",
    "we adopted a constant @xmath38-band mass - to - light ratio of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "our final sample consists of only those galaxies with both 2mass data and co detections . of these ,",
    "22 galaxies have surface densities in the literature and 6 galaxies do not .",
    "the stellar and gas surface densities are corrected to face - on values using the orientation parameters listed in table [ h1src ] .",
    "we define the transition stellar surface density ( @xmath40 ) where @xmath6(h@xmath2)=@xmath6 ( ) , as the median value of the stellar surface density at all positions for which @xmath41 .",
    "we associate this surface mass density with the transition radius @xmath42 in the galaxy by finding the radius where the azimuthally averaged stellar surface mass density @xmath43 equals the transition surface density , @xmath40 . in figure",
    "[ pressplot ] , we plot the transition radius against the transition stellar surface density , using the adopted distances in table [ h1src ] . we also list the values of @xmath44 are listed in table [ h1src ] as a check since @xmath7 depends directly on this quantity .",
    "figure [ pressplot ] shows a remarkable constancy of @xmath40 expected if @xmath6(h@xmath2)/@xmath6 ( ) is determined by pressure only ; the mean value is @xmath45 pc@xmath1 .",
    "also plotted in the figure is the range of @xmath3 measured for each individual galaxy .",
    "formally , the dispersion in the mean value of @xmath40 , is only 40% , yet the the range of @xmath3 to which the 2mass survey is sensitive in these galaxies varies by almost 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "the scatter in @xmath46 given in table [ h1src ] is only 60% .",
    "the range of galactocentric distance where the transition radius occurs varies by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "apparently , the constancy of @xmath40 is not due to a small range in the observed properties of the galaxies .",
    "the small scatter in @xmath40 also suggests that various assumptions such as that of a constant value of @xmath17 both within and among galaxies are justified .    as a check",
    ", one can calculate the value of @xmath40 for the milky way , scaling the measured @xmath3 at the distance of the sun ( 35 m@xmath0 pc@xmath1 ; binney & merrifield 1998 ) , and a radial scale length for the stars of 3 kpc ( spergel , malhotra & blitz 1996 ; dehnen & binney 1998 ) .",
    "the transition radius for the milky way occurs at a galactocentric distance of about 4 kpc ( dame et al . 1993 ) , or about 1.3 scale lengths inward of the sun .",
    "this converts to a stellar surface density of 132 m@xmath0 pc@xmath1 , in good agreement with the determinations in other galaxies .",
    "the trend can also be checked in m33 using the data for @xmath47 presented in @xcite , which gives @xmath48 where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "there appears to be a small but significant decrease in the transition surface density with radius , which may be due to a breakdown of the assumptions of a constant mass - to - light ratio , @xmath10 and @xmath17 with radius , or that pressure alone determines @xmath6(h@xmath2)/@xmath6 ( ) . a linear fit to the data in figure 1 gives @xmath51 with errors given by the scatter in the data around the trend .",
    "figure 1 is consistent with the hypothesis that the mean hydrostatic pressure determines the ratio of atomic to molecular gas at a given radius in a disk galaxy .",
    "the small scatter in the mean value of @xmath3 suggests that globally , the pressure may be the _ only _ important factor in determining the ratio of atomic to molecular gas .",
    "but the variation in the hydrostatic equilibrium of a disk is expected to be rather smooth .",
    "why then do galaxies show so much azimuthal variation in the molecular gas , and by implication in the atomic - to - molecular gas ratio ( helfer et al .",
    "significant variations in the interstellar pressure can result from a variety of causes such as spiral shocks and explosive events ( e.g. supernovae ) .",
    "thus large pressure variations can occur on all scales locally even if the mean hydrostatic pressure varies only slowly .",
    "furthermore , even if the hydrostatic pressure drives the ratio globally , locally the radiation field can be important in determining how much of a molecular cloud can remain neutral @xcite .",
    "thus , significant deviations from the mean molecular abundance can be produced by both pressure and radiation variations .",
    "pressure or density ?",
    "the rate of formation of molecular gas is thought to be dependent on the local gas density in the chemical reactions that produce h@xmath2 and co. are we then using pressure as a surrogate for the mean gas density in determining @xmath6(h@xmath2)/@xmath6 ( ) as a function of galactocentric distance ?",
    "pressure , as defined in equations 1 and 2 , is taken to be @xmath52 where @xmath24 includes both thermal and turbulent contributions . because @xmath24 is measured to be typically 7  8 km  s@xmath26and the gas temperature of the cold gas layer where most of the gas mass resides is typically @xmath53 100 k",
    ", the thermal pressure is only a small fraction of the turbulent pressure .",
    "observationally , @xmath24 is constant with radius ( see  2 ) , thus @xmath54 ; variations in pressure are effectively the same as variations in density .",
    "we choose to describe the functional dependence in terms of pressure rather than density because it is directly measurable through equation 2 ( assuming @xmath17 is known ) , whereas the density is inferred and not directly measurable on galactic scales .",
    "but it should be kept in mind that given the measured constancy of @xmath24 , we can not distinguish the effects of pressure from those of density .",
    "what pressure is implied by @xmath40 ? in the milky way ,",
    "the value of @xmath17 is about 300 pc ( binney & merrifield 1998 ) , @xmath10 is about 7 km  s@xmath26  ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) , @xmath55 is 8.6 m@xmath13  pc@xmath1 , and @xmath3 is 132 m@xmath13 pc@xmath1 . using equation [ approxpressure ] , @xmath56 = 1.5 @xmath57 cm@xmath14 k after correcting for helium .",
    "this value is still an order of magnitude below the mean internal @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 cm@xmath14 k for gmcs that have typical surface densities of @xmath62 100 m@xmath13  pc@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "because @xmath63 , gmcs that survive for more than a crossing time , @xmath64 y , must be self - gravitating . using equation 2 to scale @xmath7 to the inner regions of disks suggests that gmcs are self - gravitating over nearly the entire disk .",
    "what are the implications for understanding star formation on galactic scales ?",
    "if the global atomic  molecular transition is governed by pressure across a wide range of galaxies , it will be possible to develop a perscription for star formation on global scales that is physically well motivated . non - thermal radio - continuum",
    "is tightly correlated with the far ir emission in galaxies , implying that the radio - continuum is a good extinction - free indicator of the star formation rate in spiral galaxies .",
    "have shown that for a sample of 180 spiral galaxies , the ratio of radio - continuum to co emission is constant to within a factor of 3 , suggesting that the star formation efficiency of molecular clouds averaged over galactic scales is constant at about 3.5% . therefore , if the relationship between pressure and @xmath65 ( i.e the function @xmath66 in eqs . 1 and 2 ) can be determined for all galaxies , or if the variation in @xmath66 can be found for different galaxy types , then it will be possible to determine the star formation rate in galaxies by measuring the stellar and gas surface densities only .",
    "furthermore , it will be possible to obtain reliably the star formation rate from simulations , since the turbulent gas pressure can be directly calculated .",
    "in addition , if the variation in @xmath66 can be measured for galaxies of low metallicity , then determining the star formation rate can be extended to high @xmath67 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath66 will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "we suggest , then , that gmcs can form from either preexisting atomic or molecular gas depending on the dominant state of the diffuse interstellar medium at a particular radius in a galactic disk .",
    "that dominant state is determined by the hydrostatic pressure , modified by local perturbations such as density waves , supernova remanants , etc .",
