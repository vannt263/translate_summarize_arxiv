    "in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) a variety of periodic and quasi - periodic phenomena has been observed @xcite .",
    "this variability has mostly been associated with orbiting material in the accretion flow close to the compact object @xcite . in the case of a neutron star ( ns ) accretor , matter can accumulate on the ns surface and hence some of the variability phenomena can originate form the ns surface . depending on the properties of the layer of accreted material ( temperature , density , chemical composition of the accreted material ) the ignition conditions for hydrogen or helium fusion can be reached and stable or unstable thermonuclear burning can proceed .",
    "these conditions are largely set by the mass accretion rate @xcite .",
    "if the accretion rate stays below a critical threshold , the accumulated material undergoes unstable nuclear burning , resulting in brief , intense thermonuclear x - ray bursts ( type - i bursts ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical models of hydrogen and helium burning suggest this threshold to be located around the eddington limit , while observations place the transition of unstable to stable burning close to ten percent of the eddington limit .",
    "a possible solution for this discrepancy is to include mixing processes ,  due to rotation and rotationally induced magnetic fields .",
    "furthermore , the range of accretion rates in which the transition of unstable to stable burning takes place depends strongly on the composition of the burning layer and reaction rates @xcite .    at the transition between unstable and stable nuclear burning , the temperature dependence of the nuclear heating rate and cooling rate almost cancels .",
    "this leads to an oscillatory mode of burning called ` marginally stable burning ' .",
    "multi - zone numerical models of the ns envelope reproduce the oscillations at the transition from stable to unstable burning and derive the period of the oscillations to be the geometric mean of the accretion and thermal timescales for the burning layer , @xmath2s @xcite .",
    "a phenomenon speculated to be related to ` marginally stable burning ' on the ns surface are milli - hertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( mhz qpos ) detected in ns lmxbs .",
    "milli - hertz qpos are observed at luminosities ( @xmath3ergs@xmath4 ) close to the transition luminosity between stable and unstable burning and their centroid frequencies are close to the oscillation periods found in models of ` marginally stable burning ' .",
    "additional evidence that mhz qpos are related to nuclear burning has been obtained from the observed anti - correlation between the khz qpo frequency and count rate over one mhz qpo cycle , which suggests that the inner edge of the disk moves outward slightly as the luminosity increases during the cycle , perhaps consistent with enhanced radiation drag as the gas orbiting close to the ns is radiated by emission from the ns surface @xcite .",
    "the connection between mhz qpos and nuclear burning has been fostered by the frequency decrease of the mhz qpo in u1636  observed prior to the occurrence of a type - i x - ray burst @xcite .",
    "this frequency drift can be reproduced by models of nuclear burning that take mixing processes and crustal heating into account , and could be caused by the cooling of deeper layers of the ns atmosphere .",
    "u1636 is a persistent neutron star low - mass x - ray binary .",
    "it belongs to the class of atoll sources .",
    "u1636  shows intensity variations up to a factor of 10 on a @xmath540  d cycle @xcite , following a narrow track in the color - color diagram and hardness - intensity diagram @xcite .",
    "u1636  was first observed as a strong continuous x - ray source with copernicus @xcite and uhuru @xcite . since then",
    "the source has been observed over a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "optical photometry revealed an orbital period of @xmath53.8  h , and a companion star with a mass of @xmath50.4  m@xmath6 , assuming an ns mass of 1.4  m@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "x - ray studies of u1636  have shown a variety of variability on different time scales ranging form mhz to khz .",
    "the ns nature of the compact object has been confirmed through the detection of thermonuclear x - ray bursts @xcite , which show asymptotic millisecond burst oscillations , indicating a spin frequency of @xmath5581  hz @xcite .",
    "in addition to variability studies , the x - ray energy spectra , which show broad , asymmetric fe emission lines , have been investigated .",
    "in this study we use two archival  observations of u1636  obtained on 2009 march 14 ( obs.id : 0606070101 ) and september 5 ( obs.id : 0606070301 ) .",
    "the observations are taken with the epic / pn detector in timing mode , and have been included in the studies of @xcite , who investigated the drift of the mhz qpo frequency , the evolution of spectral parameters with the drift of the frequency , and the duration of and spectral properties during the reappearance interval .",
    "we filter and extract the pn event file , using standard sas ( version 14.0.0 ) tools , paying particular attention to extract the list of photons not randomized in time . for our study",
    "we select the longest , continuous exposure available in each observation before a type - i x - ray burst occurred , which results in an exposure of 13.3 and 10.4 ks , respectively .",
    "we use the sas task ` epatplot ` to investigate whether the observations are affected by pile - up . for the september observations",
    "we need to exclude the central three columns ( 37@xmath7rawx@xmath739 ) to minimize the effect of pile - up . to treat both observations in the same way and to obtain comparable ( detector ) count rates",
    "we exclude the same columns in the march observation .",
    "we extract powered density spectra ( pds ) and light curves for each observation using columns 31@xmath7rawx@xmath736 and 40@xmath7rawx@xmath745 . in the pds",
    ", we verify that the noise level is consistent with the one expected for poissonian noise @xcite before we subtract the contribution due to poissonian noise .",
    "afterwards we normalize the pds according to leahy @xcite and convert it to square fractional rms .",
    "from both observations we obtain light curves in which mhz qpos , on a time scale of @xmath5140 s , are clearly present ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lc ] ) . in the september observation the mhz qpos",
    "are observed before the occurrence of a type - i burst that is also covered by this observation @xcite .",
    "in addition , this observation covers about 20 ks after the type - i burst during which no mhz qpos have been detected . based on power density spectra",
    "we obtain an averaged centroid frequency in the range of 6.6  7.2 mhz and 6.1  6.5 mhz , respectively .",
    "we derive the mhz qpo waveform through a multi - step process ( similar to the approach used in * ? ? ?",
    "at first we create a template of the waveform : we smooth the light curve by a factor of 3 ,  we replace the value in each bin by the averaged value obtained from this bin and its two adjacent neighbors .",
    "we then search for local maxima and minima in windows of 140 s of the smoothed light curve .",
    "we make sure that the extrema are alternating (  we excluded cases where there are  two maxima without a minimum in between ) , that the highest / lowest peak between two minima / maxima is picked as a maximum / minimum and that the maxima / minima exceed / fall below the averaged count rate by at least 30 per cent .",
    "we then aline the maxima found to obtain a first template of the waveform . to refine the waveform the template is correlated with the original (  not smoothed ) light curve in steps of one bin width .",
    "a set of extrema is obtained using the best correlations in windows of 140 s and the maxima are alined to get a refined template of the waveform .",
    "the correlation and alining is repeated until a stable waveform is found .",
    "it takes 9(8 ) steps for the march(september ) observation until the difference of the averaged count rate is less than 10@xmath8 cts / s in two consecutive steps .",
    "the obtained waveforms consist of a plateau of rather constant count rate , which we call the `` quiescence '' state of the mhz qpo , they then show a fast rise and a rather symmetric decline , followed by another plateau of rather constant count rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse_prof ] ) .",
    "both plateaus , at the beginning and end , occur at a similar count rate , and the pulse itself is located between @xmath9 .",
    "we want to point out that we assumed in this approach that the shape of the waveform stays the same despite the drift of the centroid frequency . to check",
    "if this assumption is reasonable , we divide the light curve in half and determine the waveform in each half .",
    "the waveform obtained from the half closer to the occurrence of the type - i burst agrees well with the waveform found in the other half .",
    "to obtain phase resolved energy spectra we use standard sas tools and the start and end times of each bin from the light curves . during the extraction of energy spectra",
    "we pay special attention to generate arf files of the pile - up corrected source region , following the steps laid down in the  users guide .",
    "to extract background spectra we use columns 3@xmath7rawx@xmath75 . to get better statistics we regroup the bins ( width:@xmath10 ) of the pulse into five bins , corresponding to early rise ( @xmath11 ) , rise ( @xmath12 ) , peak ( @xmath13 ) , decay ( @xmath14 ) and late decay ( @xmath15 ) of the pulse and extract an energy spectrum of each bin for both observations .",
    "we extract also a spectrum of the ` quiescence ' state of the mhz qpo , using @xmath16 .",
    "the spectral fitting is done using isis v.  1.6.2 @xcite .",
    "we fit the ` quiescence ' spectra of both observations individually with an absorbed blackbody plus disk blackbody model , where the single blackbody accounts for the emission of the neutron star surface / boundary layer and the disk blackbody component for the emission of the accretion disk @xcite , to obtain a model of the x - ray emission of the accreting neutron star .",
    "we used the ` tbabs ` absorption model @xcite with abundances of @xcite and the cross sections given in @xcite , with he cross - section based on @xcite .",

    "in @xcite the mhz qpo is interpreted as an oscillatory burning mode across the whole neutron star surface . according to this interpretation",
    "the oscillations come from variations in the blackbody temperature .",
    "to test this picture we fit the phase resolved energy spectra with the model of the `` quiescence '' spectra , leaving the blackbody temperature free .",
    "we find a change of the blackbody temperature ( on the 10 ev scale ) with the pulse profile , but the obtained reduced @xmath38 values are unacceptable large ( tabel [ tab : specpar ] ) and the spectral residuals clearly show that an additional component at lower energies is present .",

    "variability on time scales of 100  1000 s has been observed that has been attributed to disk instabilities @xcite . however , the shape of the light curve , a gradual increase through a shoulder followed by a sharp drop and a secondary and in some cases even a tertiary peak observed in grs1919 + 105 differs significantly from the rather symmetric profile we find in the case of 4u163653 .",
