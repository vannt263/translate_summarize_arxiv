    "( 2013 ) , most of the interacting clumps are distributed on the boundary of the snr .",
    "although their 3-dimensional spacial distribution may be complicated , for simplicity , we assume that they are all close to the snr edge . according to the flux ratio ( above 0.25tev ) between the outer ( escape ) and inner ( trapped ) components , @xmath22.8:7.2",
    ", we fit the tev profile , as in model  ia , and obtain the inner radius of the cavity wall @xmath108 and the thicknesses of the outer and inner emission regions @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "the fitting profile line is plotted by the black dashed line in figure  [ fig : pro](a ) and also can reproduce the observed features , including the outer extending part .",
    "similar fittings to the earlier 0.340tev hess  data of the entire snr @xcite are also made with model  ia  and model  iia  ( see figure  [ fig : pro](b ) ) . for model  ia , according to the 0.340 tev flux ratio between the outer and inner components , @xmath23.9:6.1 , we obtain the thicknesses of the outer and inner emission zones @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively . for model  iia , based on the 0.340tev flux ratio between the two zones , @xmath22.7:7.3 , the thicknesses of the two zones are fitted as @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively . for both models , @xmath115pc and @xmath116pc are used .",

    "tev @xmath1-ray  emission via a @xmath14@xmath14 interaction mechanism @xcite . in their model ,",
    "the @xmath1-ray  emission arises from the cr precursor region , where the accelerated protons directly interact with the target particles without an escape process .",
    "both gev and tev @xmath1-ray  emission are dominated by hadronic emission and should be outside the remnant . especially for tev @xmath1-rays ,",
    "the emission is mainly concentrated in the dense shell with a thickness of 0.3pc ( corresponding to @xmath21@xmath117 at a distance of 1kpc ) , which may be difficult to match the broad tev radial profile even if the psf of hess  and the projected effect are taken into account . in our model , the emission arises from two zones : the emission from the inside of the snr can be either due to ic scattering or collision of the trapped protons with the shocked clumps , and the outer emission is ascribed to the collision of the protons that escaped from the shock front during the previous expansion with the surrounding dense matter .",

    "tev @xmath1-ray  spectrum of snr rx  j1713.7@xmath03946 and the tev @xmath1-ray  radial profile , we have explored the role played by the diffusive relativistic protons that escaped from the snr shock wave in the @xmath1-ray  emission , apart from the high - energy particles emission from the inside of the snr . in the scenario that the snr shock is propagating in a molecular cavity , in which there may be interspersal shocked dense clumps , we consider that the @xmath1-ray  emission from the inside of the snr may arise either from the ic scattering ( model  ia ) or from the interaction between the trapped energetic protons and the clumps ( model  iia ) .",
    "the dominant origin between them depends on the electron - to - proton number ratio , above or below @xmath24@xmath118 .",
    "the surrounding molecular cavity wall is considered to also produce @xmath1-ray  emission due to the  illumination \" by the diffusive protons that escaped from the shock wave during the expansion history .",
    "we simplify the algorithm for the @xcite  accumulative diffusion \" model for diffusive escaping protons .",
    "this two - zone model is fit to the broadband spectrum of the snr that incorporates the updated 5yr fermi data , with application of the mcmc method .",
    "the broadband fluxes can be well explained by the two - zone model , in which the @xmath1-ray  emission from the inside governs the tev band , while the outer emission component substantially contributes to the gev @xmath1-rays and naturally compensates for the underestimate of the gev flux of the inner component . in the meantime",
