    "various theoretical models have been proposed for the physical mechanisms driving the accretion and outflow processes in classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) , with the most popular being perhaps blandford and payne s ( 1982 ) pioneering study of magnetocentrifugally driven winds from keplerian disks . however , the x - wind model has gained credence in recent years for a variety of theoretical and observational reasons ( see also the discussion in  5 ) .",
    "it is instructive at the outset to summarize and compare the different ctts models , to review the rationale for x - wind theory and the evidence in its favor , and to motivate our subsequent generalization of this picture ( see also shu et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the first accretion models of cttss proposed that they were surrounded by keplerian disks , which extend all the way to the stellar surface , with accretion occuring through an equatorial boundary layer ( e.g. , bertout 1987 ; kenyon & hartmann 1987 ; bertout et al .",
    "1988 ) . motivated by the observational finding that the driver behind some well - known bipolar outflow sources are neutral winds containing h i and co ( lizano et al .",
    "1988 ) , a combination not seen in the interstellar medium but present in the photospheres of cool stars , shu et al . (",
    "1988 ) suggested that the driving outflows are caused by boundary - layer disk - accretion onto a strongly magnetized young stellar object ( yso ) .",
    "the accretion provides a rationale for why a protostar might rotate near break - up , and hartmann & macgregor ( 1982 ) had already shown that magnetized stars rotating near break - up could shed matter and angular momentum extremely efficiently through their equatorial zones .",
    "however , shu et al . ( 1988 ) obtained preliminary indications that streamline collimation in this kind of model was absent , or extremely slow , and therefore they speculated stellar jets were associated with `` ordinary '' stellar winds confined to flow along the rotation axis by the more powerful `` extraordinary '' centrifugally - driven outflow that they later called an x - wind .",
    "when a disk abuts a fully convective star , ekman pumping ( internal circulation caused by slight pressure differences in a field of differential rotation ) to the equatorial boundary layer adjoining the star and the disk eventually causes the entire star to spin near break - up if there are no countervailing spin - down torques ( galli 1990 ; see fig .",
    "10 of shu et al .",
    "cttss are fully convective , yet they usually rotate at velocities one order of magnitude below break - up ( e.g. , vogel & kuhi 1981 ; hartmann & stauffer 1989 ; bouvier et al . 1993 , 2007 ) .",
    "shu et al . ( 1988 ) therefore speculated that cttss are young stars in which the spin - down by ordinary stellar winds overcame the spin - up toques of the viscous boundary - layer , and that cttss would not have strongly collimated outflows .",
    "the latter expectation turned out to be false ( see , e.g. , edwards et al . 1993 ) .",
    "nevertheless , matt & pudritz ( 2005 , 2008a , b ) have recently resurrected the idea that magnetized stellar winds might provide sufficient torque to explain the slow rotation of t tauri stars and , perhaps , be responsible for a part of the observed optical jets from ysos .",
    "the latter proposal using coronal gas to launch the stellar winds has , however , foundered on the constraints provided by x - ray observations of t tauri stars ( bisnovatyi - kogan & lamzin 1977 , decampli 1981 , matt & pudritz 2008c ) , and the finding that ctts stellar winds appear to be an order of magnitude cooler ( johns - krull & herczeg 2007 ) than suggested recently ( dupree et al .",
    "the issues , therefore , became _ ( 1 ) _ how to accrete high angular momentum disk material onto a ctts while keeping the latter rotating slowly , _",
    "( 2 ) _ how simultaneously to generate winds efficiently from the star+disk system , and _ ( 3 ) _ how to make the outflowing wind appear as a jet despite the slow streamline collimation ?    knigl ( 1991 ) suggested a solution for the accretion part of this problem by adopting the theory developed by ghosh & lamb ( 1978 ; 1979a , b ) .",
    "a strong stellar magnetosphere is assumed to truncate the disk some distance from the stellar surface , with accreting material flowing onto the star not through a boundary layer but via magnetic field lines threading the disk .",
    "the angular momentum of the star is then regulated by the interaction between the stellar magnetosphere and the disk .",
    "field lines originating in the star and with disk footpoints within the keplerian corotation radius ( @xmath0 ) are dragged forward by the disk gas , relative to the star , and thus tend to spin the star up ( at the expense of the disk gas ) .",
    "stellar field lines threading the slower rotating disk beyond @xmath0 , on the other hand , tend to spin the star down .",
    "the slow rotation of ctts then arise if the spin - down caused by the outer disk outweighs the spin - up by the inner parts .",
    "large turbulent diffusivities must prevail to allow magnetic fields to slip through the gas in such a picture .    in a series of papers with a precedent in the suggestions of arons ( 1986 ) and camenzind ( 1990 ) , shu and collaborators ( shu et al .",
    "1994a , b ; najita & shu 1994 ; ostriker & shu 1995 , hereafter os95 ; shu et al . 1995 ) embraced the idea that strong yso magnetospheres might truncate the disk before it abuts the stellar surface , but they pointed out a number of difficulties with the specific proposal of knigl ( 1991 ) .",
    "the resolution of these difficulties turned out to provide solutions for each of the issues _ ( 1 ) _ to _ ( 3 ) _ listed above .",
    "first , the picture painted by ghosh & lamb and knigl changes considerably if turbulent resistivities are not large , but small , i.e. , if field diffusion is competitive with advective flow not on dynamical time scales but secular ones . in such cases ,",
    "the long - term processes of angular - monetum transport outwards and mass - transport inwards dominate over notions of `` ram - pressure balance '' .",
    "second , stellar fields strong enough to truncate an electrically conducting disk are automatically also strong enough to drive a magnetocentrifugal outflow along the outermost flux tubes of the stellar field , which are opened into an x - wind .",
    "the magnetic torques in the wind cause the outflowing matter to gain angular momentum at the expense of the material still connected to it by field lines threading through the disk .",
    "the back reactions to the x - wind and funnel - flow give a pinch of the exterior field lines inward and the interior field lines outward towards a common mid - point @xmath0 , _ with a net trapped flux _",
    ", that gives the x - wind model its name .",
    "this mid - point is both in keplerian rotation and in corotation with the star , i.e. , @xmath1 , a condition that came to be called _ disk locking_. third ,",
    "isodensity contours become cylindrically stratified very quickly after the gas accelerates from the x - region ( najita & shu 1994 ; shu et al .",
    "1995 ) , yielding the optical illusion in the emission of forbidden - line and radio emission that x - winds achieve jet - like collimation close to the base of the flow ( shang et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ) . in actual practice ,",
    "streamline collimation is logarithmically slow , which has observable consequences for position - velocity diagrams obtained from long - slit spectrograms ( e.g. , pyo et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "many numerical simulations have also been devoted to the x - wind / funnel flow problem , the most successful being that of romanova et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . indeed ,",
    "the progress made by the simulations is most concisely revealed by examining why they succeeded in obtaining the simultaneous existence of x - winds and funnel flows over extended durations when others failed . as stated in the previous paragraph and detailed in",
    " 2 , the crucial concept in x - wind / funnel flow theory is that of the _ trapped flux",
    "_ created by the two - sided pinching of field lines toward @xmath0 . in the presence of non - zero resistivity @xmath2",
    ", field diffusion will occur out of the x - region .",
    "this diffusion must be offset by fluid advection from both the exterior and the interior of @xmath0 .    in the exterior , disk inflow is induced both from back - reaction from the x - wind ( if present ) and by viscous inflow from the disk proper , with the level of kinematic viscosity @xmath3 dictating the disk accretion - rate @xmath4 . if the viscosity @xmath3 is only comparable to the resistivity @xmath2 , the disk inflow is too weak relative to diffusive penetration to produce a good inward pinch , a failure not conducive to the generation of x - winds . to produce sufficiently outward - bending field lines from viscous accretion , it is necessary to have @xmath2 smaller than @xmath3 ( by a factor of roughly the disk - aspect ratio @xmath5 ; see lubow , papalozou , & pringle 1994 and shu et al .",
    "2007 ) . for the specific problem of an accretion disk interacting with a stellar magnetosphere , the simulations of romanova et al .",
    "( 2008 ) demonstrate explicitly that the condition @xmath6 is indeed the crucial ingredient to achieving an x - type magnetic configuration and thereby generating an x - wind .    in the interior , a funnel flow involving closed field lines links the star to the disk .",
    "if the stellar rotation rate @xmath7 is not chosen to be the same as the angular speed @xmath8 of the parts of the disk to which the filed lines are rooted , rapid transients are induced .",
    "some early simulations , which started with slowly rotating stellar magnetospheres linked to rapidily rotating disks in the initial state , managed to obtain temporary x - type magnetic configurations via such transients ( hayashi et al .",
    "1996 , miller & stone 1997 , kker et al .",
    "the sudden removal of angular momentum from the disk by magnetic torques creates a dynamic onrush of material toward the star , generating a temporary magnetic pinch and outflow . in these studies , finite resistivity",
    "is sometimes included in the code , but this resistivity plays no important role because the magnetic diffusion is slow compared to the fast inward flow caused by the large disequilibrium of the initial state .",
    "goodson et al . ( 1997 , 1999 ) , goodson & winglee ( 1999 ) , and romanova et al . ( 2002 , 2003 , 2004a , 2005 , 2008 ; hereafter r02 , r03 , r04 , r05 , r08 ) pioneered the incorporation of more realistically rotating stellar magnetospheres , with the later papers of the latter group and goodson et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) using controlled levels of resistivity and viscosity . in particular , r02 and r03 performed axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric calculations that start with an unperturbed , aligned and tilted , stellar dipole field threading a circumstellar disk that begins to accrete slowly via a postulated disk viscosity @xmath3 .",
    "the only resistivity in the problem is numerical and gives an effective value for @xmath2 comparable to @xmath3 .",
    "although no x - winds arose as a consequence , these authors did show that in steady - state the radius @xmath9 where the magnetosphere corotates with the disk is close to the disk truncation radius ( denoted by them as the stellar magnetopause @xmath10 ) , with the best runs having @xmath11 = 1.21.3 ( see also long et al .",

    "2006 ; hereafter u06 ) .",
    "the simulations of r04 discovered `` magnetic towers '' in the stellar corona near the rotation axis as first proposed by draine ( 1983 ) and lynden - bell ( 1996 ) . with realistic levels of coronal density",
    ", such towers do not carry much matter and can not explain yso jets ( long et al .",

    "the main remaining differences between ideal x - wind theory and numerical simulations concerns whether outflows can be steady .",
    "figure 1 shows that field lines dead to inflow or outflow ( black ) separate the funnel flow ( red ) from the x - wind ( blue ) .",
    "some of the dead - zone field lines are closed and link the disk to the star ; some are open and `` joined at infinity '' line by line to the magnetic field contained in the x - wind",
    ". the reversal of field direction across the separatrix between the open dead - zone fields and the open x - wind fields of ideal mhd would be unstable to reconnection events in the presence of finite resistivity .",
    "these reconnection events , which are likely to be episodic ( aly & kuijpers 1990 ) , would create a fluctuating x - wind ( shu et al .",
    "1997 ; romonova et al .",
    "1998 ; uzdensky , knigl , & litwin 2002 ) , and may underlie the outbursting behavior found in the simulations of goodson et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) , r04 , r05 , u06 , and r08 .",
    "the steady assumption of ideal x - wind theory is then made for analytic simplicity , and can at best represent only the time - average of outflows that are time - variable and quasi - periodic in reality .",
    "to date , most of the formal developments of x - wind theory surmise that the magnetic field configuration of the star in the absence of any interactions with the disk is a pure dipole .",
    "but this is a dubious simplification because there is no reason to expect that the dynamo action in slowly rotating , fully convective objects ( such as t tauri stars ) will create a highly organized pattern of surface magnetic fields . indeed",
    ", polarization studies indicate that an organized dipole component can not be dominant on the surfaces of most t tauri stars ( valenti & johns - krull 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , the observed covering fraction of `` hot spots '' due to funnel flows is typically much smaller ( 0.1 - 1% of the stellar surface ) than the predictions from dipole models ( johns - krull & gafford 2002 , hereafter jg02 , and references therein ; see also gregory et al .",
    "2006a and jardine et al .",
    "recent numerical simulations by chabrier & kker ( 2006 ) similarly predict that in fully convective objects , the @xmath13 dynamo effect should produce large - scale non - dipolar magnetic fields , dominated by higher - order multipoles .",
    "numerical simulations have kept pace with the observational developments .",
    "thus , romanova et al .  (",
    "2004b ) have performed 3-d mhd simulations of the funnel flows that result from inclined stellar dipoles , and long et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) have included the further superposition of quadrupole contributions to such 3-d calculations .",
    "relative to the observational issues raised by jg02 regarding funnel flows and their hot spots , the most important finding of these 3-d results is that the central portions of the hot spots are hotter than their peripheries , yielding the possibility that the total hot - spot covering fraction may have been under - estimated by the uv observations .",
    "fortunately , the general validity of the x - wind model does not depend on detailed assumptions such as the dipole approximation .",
    "the important features are ( a ) the existence of trapped flux @xmath14 in the x - region , and ( b ) the assumption of disk locking .",
    "let us see how these two ideas lead to relationships between physical parameters of the system that agree better with observations of the funnel flows of t tauri stars than other predictions ( jg02 ) .",
    "we adopt cylindrical coordinates @xmath15 with origin at the center of the star .",
    "suppose that the pinch toward the x - point traps an amount of magnetic flux equal to @xmath14 in an equatorial ring with radius @xmath16 .",
    "in the immediate vicinity of the x - region , the trapped flux must be nearly force - free above and below the midplane ( which is not force - free ) . in the cold limit where the x - region corresponds essentially to the single radius @xmath0",
    ", the field configuration achieves the shape of a complete fan , and a third of all the trapped field lines bow sufficiently outward or inward to launch an x - wind or a funnel flow , carrying respectively a fraction @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the disk accretion rate @xmath4 .",
    "the fraction @xmath17 of matter that physically climbs onto open field lines in the x - wind depends on how diffusive effects load different field lines in the x - region .",

    "fraction @xmath17 a free parameter ( see further discussion at the end of  2.2 ) .",
    "the field lines that are loaded with infalling gas in the funnel flow are the same ones that carry the gas all the way to the star .",
    "let @xmath20 be the fraction of the surface area @xmath21 of the upper hemisphere covered by hot spots of mean field - strength @xmath22 .",
    "then the magnetic flux connected to hot spots , @xmath23 , must be equal to the same 1/3 of the trapped flux @xmath14 ( defined for convenience to be positive ) that links to the base of the funnel flow in the upper surface of the x - region : @xmath24 we will assume that the lower hemisphere looks the same as the upper hemisphere except with reversed directions of the magnetic field .    in order to produce a self - consistent mhd flow , the trapped flux must be able to produce a time rate of change of the @xmath25-component of the angular momentum in the funnel flow equal to @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the angular momentum per unit mass of material orbiting the star at the inner disk edge , and @xmath28 is the average fraction of this specific angular momentum that lands on the star ( a conserved quantity carried partly by matter and partly by the magnetic torques of the field ) .",
    "an analogous argument must apply to the torque supplied to the x - wind by the flux @xmath29 contained in it ; namely , the wind torque must supply a time - rate of change of the angular - momentum equal to @xmath30 thus , angular momentum enters the x - region at a rate @xmath31 through disk accretion , while angular momentum leaves the x - region at a rate @xmath32 through the outflow in the wind , and at a rate @xmath33 by accretion through the funnel flow .",
    "in addition , there is a viscous toque @xmath34 exerted by disk matter interior to the x - region on disk matter exterior to it . in steady state ,",
    "the single term representing angular momentum entering the x - region must be balanced by the sum of the three terms leaving it . if we solve the resulting equation for the fraction @xmath17 of the disk accretion rate that is carried in the x - wind , we get ( see shu et al .",

    "; pyo et al . 2006 ) . to obtain the standoff distance @xmath37 for the stellar magnetopause , we need a model that gives the trapped flux @xmath45 as a function of distance @xmath37 from the center of the stellar multipole distribution ( see   2.2 and 4.1 ) .      to obtain the x - point location in the meridional plane , @xmath37 , it is necessary ( as in os95 ) to input the dynamics of the x - wind because , by assumption in the simplest model , it is the x - wind back torque that is trying to drive the inner edge of the disk inward .",
    "the funnel flow field lines , being strong , then provide whatever ( small ) azimuthal component @xmath46 is needed to yield a back torque that holds the inner edge in equilibrium at @xmath37 .",
    "this assumption ignores any role for a magnetic tower that might torque down the spin of the star ( e.g. , r04 , long et al .",
    "2005 ) , and it is an open question in our opinion whether real yso coronae can be sufficiently dense to make such braking important .",

    "this assumption allows us to shrink the x - region to a mathematical point in the meridional plane , with the disk having infinitiesimal vertical thickness in the same approximation .",

    "this is encapsulated in the discussion of   3.3 and 4.2 , where the surface field geometry helps to determine the quantities @xmath20 and @xmath81 .",

    ". thus , there is no unbalanced `` ram pressure '' that the nearly _ corotating _ magnetic field at the disk s inner edge needs to offset .",
    "what the stellar magnetosphere needs to do to truncate the disk is to transfer enough positive angular momentum outwards so as to offset the negative torques that are trying to drive the disk inwards in the equatorial plane .",
    "the important point that disk truncation in cttss arises , not from ram pressure effects , but from considerations of angular momentum transport was first made by cameron & campbell ( 1993 ) .",
    "their analysis is closest in spirit to os95 s and ours .",
    "the similarity is nearest in the prediction that disks are truncated at inner edges which lie close to the radius where the disk corotates with the central star , a phenomenon that has come to be called `` disk locking . ''",
    "both analyses also ignore the presence of any intrinsic magnetization of the disk .",
    "the main differences are that we suppose ( 1 ) that the disk resistivity is much smaller than the disk viscosity ( by a factor proportional to the disk - aspect ratio ; see shu et al .",
    "2007 ) , and ( 2 ) that the viscous torque in the disk is negligible relative to the funnel - flow and x - wind torques , so that neither of the values of the coefficients of viscosity @xmath3 and resistivity @xmath2 enter the final formulae in the limit of a vanishing ratio for the sound speed to keplerian velocity in the x - region , except for the dependence implicit in our assumption for the wind - loading fraction @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast , cameron & campbell ( 1993 ) make detailed assumptions concerning @xmath3 and @xmath2 , which they assume are equal in turbulent circumstances , and they ignore the x - wind torque , equating the funnel - flow torque to ( the negative of ) the viscous torque .",
    "moreover , instead of computing the funnel - flow torque in the funnel , they estimate it from the slip present between the mid - plane of the disk , assumed to rotate at keplerian speeds , and its surface , assumed to corotate at the angular speed of the star , for regions that are magnetically connected to the star .",
    "they parameterize this slip by an unknown factor @xmath83 that characterizes the resulting azimuthal magnetic field giving rise to a magnetic couple . , reads @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the mean toroidal magnetic field at the surface of a disk of half - height @xmath86 , and @xmath7 and @xmath87 are , respectively , the rotation rates of the star and the disk ( which is keplerian ) in the neighborhood of the truncation radius @xmath88 . to avoid violent parker instabilities ,",
    "cameron & parker require @xmath89 to be not much larger than @xmath90 , whereas their analysis suggests that @xmath87 and @xmath7 can differ by amounts that make @xmath91 considerably larger than the thermal speed @xmath92 in the midplane of the disk .",
    "they consider two cases , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( cf . the unnumbered eq .",

    "they find that the observations bear little correlation with all dipole predictions , including that of os95 .",
    "the scatter is greatly reduced and a significant correlation is found , however , when the data are compared to the relationship of equation ( [ jkg ] ) , where the dipole approximation is dropped . thus , the generalized x - wind model for accretion flows is indeed compatible with current observations .",

    "thus , if @xmath100 is a theoretically computable coefficient , then not only can the slope of a log - log plot of the variables on the left- and right - hand sides of equation ( [ jkg ] ) be checked , but so can its intercept . indeed , @xmath22 and @xmath20 have now been simultaneously measured in at least two t tauri stars ( v2129 oph , donati et al .",
    "2007 ; bp tau , donati et al . 2008 ) ; we compare the data to our theory in  4.3 and find reasonable agreement .",
    "we wish to pursue the consequences of the above theoretical discussion .",
    "in particular , we wish to test whether flux - trapping at the x - point can lead to accretion funnel flows even when the unperturbed stellar field is not a pure dipole .",
    "our technique is to use direct numerical calculation , analogous to that carried out by os95 for the dipolar case . specifically , we will model time - independent , axisymmetric accretion flows where the unperturbed field on the stellar surface is composed of higher - order multipoles .",
    "we state at the outset that we adopt the simplification of os95 that the sub - alfvenic conditions of the funnel flow and the dead zones surrounding it can be approximated with vacuum fields plus current sheets , rather than treating the problem by the more accurate , but also considerably more complex , grad - shafranov equation ( see , e.g. , cai et al .",
    "even with this simplification and the further assumption of axial symmetry , the removal of the dipole constraint means that our particular choices of the stellar field configuration will be neither unique nor universally applicable .",
    "we expect the actual field to differ from star to star , and to vary with time on any given star .",
    "the goal of our study is more limited : to demonstrate explicitly how it is possible to satisfy the two primary observational constraints that the net surface field polarization in t tauri stars is small , and that the accretion hot spots cover only a small part of the stellar surface .",
    "the dipole model calculations for the inner ( funnel - flow ) solution have been discussed in detail by os95 . here",
    "we describe only our new multipole calculations for the funnel flow , while drawing attention to the salient points of departure from the dipole model .",
    "the particular stellar multipole field we choose is discussed in the next section .",
    "we assume an unperturbed stellar field that is some multipole aligned with the stellar rotation axis .",
    "we also assume that the poloidal component of the final field ( i.e. , the perturbed field after accounting for interactions with the disk and flux - trapping ) is in a vacuum - field potential configuration ( i.e. , is curl - free ) , _ including _ the field lines loaded with accreting matter .",
    "this condition is approximately satisfied provided @xmath101 the alvn mach number of the flow , @xmath102 , satisfies @xmath102 @xmath103 1 everywhere , and @xmath104 the net fractional specific angular momentum carried to the star in the funnel flow , @xmath28 , satisfies @xmath105 @xmath103 1 .",
    "the first condition means that the magnetic field energy dominates the matter kinetic energy even on the field lines participating in the funnel flow .",
    "this is certainly true at both the x - point pinch and near the surface of the star , given the high field strengths in those regions . with the condition satisfied at both ends ,",
    "we ( like os95 ) plausibly assume it is also true everywhere between .",
    "the second condition means that any stellar spin - up or spin - down , due to the specific angular momentum carried on to the star by the accretion flow , is very slow - of order the accretion timescale - as is observed ( see discussion of equation ( 2 ) in  2 ) .",
    "these considerations justify our ( and os95 s ) assumption of a curl - free poloidal field , @xmath106 = 0 ; i.e. , the associated magnetic flux @xmath107 satisfies the vacuum - field condition , @xmath108    os95 adopt the agnostic choice @xmath28 = 0 to keep a small star slowly rotating . in this case , with @xmath102 @xmath103 1 , the field lines in the funnel flow must have a small but non - zero azimuthal component .",
    "combined with the poloidal field , this produces field lines that are trailing spirals , leading to an outward transfer of angular momentum , extracted from the inflowing material in the funnel flow by the resulting magnetic torques , and transferred back to the footpoints of the funnel flow field in the x - region of the disk . because the azimuthal component is small compared to the poloidal field in the funnel flow , the overall field geometry interior to the x - point is well represented by the poloidal field @xmath109 alone .",

    "the salient features of our chosen field are as follows .",
    "the @xmath168 are all roughly equal within a factor of a few , implying , via equation ( [ lapsolphi ] ) with @xmath144 = @xmath165 @xmath152 1 , that the various components of the multipole flux are all roughly comparable ( within an order of magnitude ) on the stellar surface ( the corresponding radial magnetic _ field _ on the surface , @xmath155(@xmath144=1 ) is dominated by the higher orders , with a very weak dipole component ) .",
    "the corresponding surface field geometry is highly loopy , as implied by the oscillatory shape of @xmath155 and @xmath172 in figure 2 and explicitly illustrated in figure 3 .",

    "moving away from the star , the higher order multipoles rapidly weaken , with @xmath173 @xmath174 @xmath175 ; the loopiness of the field decreases ; and the purely dipole component finally dominates at large distances ( at @xmath176 5@xmath165 for our adopted field ; see fig .",
    "3 ) . we can therefore expect the funnel flow solution near the x - point ( i.e. , the values of @xmath177 and @xmath178 ) to resemble the os95 dipole solution when @xmath0/@xmath165 is sufficiently large .",
    "however , we emphasize that , independent of the value of @xmath179 , the important consideration is the trapped flux , and not the detailed multipole character of the stellar field .",
    "it is noteworthy that the unperturbed field varies non - monotonically in both strength and direction with radius , unlike in the dipole case .",
    "while each of the multipole components declines monotonically with radius , the vectorial directions of all the components are not the same . consequently , the multipole fields cancel out more in some regions than in others , yielding a summed field that oscillates in strength and direction with radius and is null at some radii , specifically , at 1.015@xmath165 and 3.25@xmath165 ( figs . 2 , 3 ) .",
    "the summed field @xmath169 finally decreases smoothly to zero at large distances , once the dipole dominates .",
    "for the pure dipole case , os95 normalized by @xmath0 to find a unique solution ( in terms of @xmath180 and @xmath178 ) _ independent _ of @xmath181 .",
    "this strategy is possible since the unperturbed field looks the same geometrically at all radii for a dipole ( or for any other single higher order multipole ) , and the location of the stellar surface is immaterial for the scaled solution . in our case , the location of the stellar surface is fixed by our choice of the normalization length for the specification of different multipoles . as a consequence , the funnel flow solution ( @xmath177 and @xmath178 ) for a _ specified _ surface field configuration composed of a _ mixture _ of mutipoles can not adapt unchanged to a stellar radius @xmath80 that is chosen arbitrarily relative to @xmath37 .",
    "however , once a funnel flow solution is found for a given @xmath37 , the stellar surface can be redrawn at an arbitrary location to represent the solution for a _ different _ surface field than the one originally specified .",
    "this is possible because , while the initial unperturbed field is fixed globally by its specified configuration on the stellar surface , our actual numerical calculation of the solution from this depends only on the location of @xmath37 relative to the origin and not with respect to the stellar surface ( i.e. , the stellar surface is not used as a boundary condition , the origin is ) .",
    "thus , while the derived solution corresponds to the originally specified surface field if the surface is drawn at @xmath80=1 , it also corresponds to a different surface configuration for @xmath80@xmath1821 ( with the relative surface field strength contributions of the @xmath183 multipoles in the new configuration being @xmath184 times their originally specified values ) . obviously , the solution for a given @xmath37 will correspond to a different @xmath37/@xmath165 for @xmath165@xmath1821 compared to @xmath165=1 .",
    "however , since the solution fixes the amount of trapped flux , the quantity @xmath185  the funnel flow magnetic flux on the stellar surface  remains constant independent of the @xmath165 location ( see equation [ 1 ] ) . in",

    "the difference in @xmath107 at @xmath37 between the angles @xmath200 and @xmath126 is simply 1/3 of the total trapped flux @xmath45 .",
    "thus , when the covering fraction is small , we have the approximation , @xmath201 with it being unimportant in the ratio on the right - hand side whether we use scaled dimensional values for @xmath45 and @xmath202 or unscaled nondimensional values .",

    "@xmath0 = 7.5@xmath165 : the converged solution for this case is plotted in fig .",
    "5 . it corresponds to @xmath177 = 1.71 and @xmath178 = 0.61 .",
    "the flow lands on the stellar surface at a mean colatitude of @xmath207 , with a covering fraction of 0.093% ( @xmath205 = 0.08@xmath203 ) , compared to @xmath206 4% for a pure dipole with @xmath0 = 7.5@xmath165 .",
    "the solution parameters are close to the 10@xmath165 case , but not identical , for the following reason .",
    "while the dipole component utterly dominates at 7.5@xmath165 , the quadrupole starts to be non - negligible at smaller radii , with a polarity opposite that of the dipole .",
    "this is evident in fig . 5 , where we see that @xmath128 , the inner edge of the inward excursion of the disk , is not very far from the magnetic null point at 3.25@xmath165 , where the dipole field is completely cancelled by higher orders .",
    "thus the net flux swept into the x - region increases slower with decreasing radius than in the purely dipolar case , requiring a larger inward extension of the disk , i.e. , smaller @xmath178 , to trap sufficient flux than for a pure dipole .",
    "the above behavior raises the interesting question : what happens as @xmath0 continues to approach the null point at 3.25@xmath165 from radii exterior to it ? in the 7.5@xmath165 case above , enough flux resides between the null point and @xmath0 to provide a good solution , despite the increasing importance of the quadrupolar component of opposite polarity to the dipole one . at some stage , however , this will no longer be true , and flux from radii _ interior _ to the null point will start getting swept into the x - region exterior to it . since the field reverses at the null point , the net effect will be the reduction of trapped flux in the x - region .",
    "a converged solution will then arise only when enough flux from radii interior to the null point has been swept in to offset this cancellation and once again provide sufficient trapped flux .",
    "the field lines supporting the funnel flow must consist now entirely of ones that originate at low latitudes , below the second loop , instead of above it as in the 7.5@xmath165 case ( see fig .",
    "the result is a latitudinal change of 30@xmath203 in the hot - spot location ( and a reversal in the polarity of the radial magnetic field in the hot spot compared to the previous location ) . in other words , at some critical juncture , the hot - spot position must jump significantly for a small shift in @xmath0 , or equivalently , for a small change in the accretion rate .",
    "this is illustrated in the following solution .",
    "@xmath0 = 5@xmath165 : the final field configuration for this case is plotted in fig .",
    "the solution parameters are @xmath177 = -25.0 and @xmath178 = 0.247 . the flow lands at a mean colatitude of @xmath208 on the stellar surface , with a covering fraction of 2.74% ( @xmath205 = 1.65@xmath203 ) , compared to @xmath206 6% for a pure dipole with @xmath0 = 5@xmath165 .",
    "these numbers validate our thought experiment above .",
    "the cancellation of flux in the x - region by field of opposite polarities requires far more flux from radii interior to the null point to be swept in to finally acquire enough trapped flux ; consequently the inward excursion of the disk is much larger ( @xmath178 much smaller ) , and the ratio of trapped to unperturbed flux ( @xmath177 ) much higher , than in the 7.5@xmath165 and 10@xmath165 cases above .",
    "the negative sign of @xmath177 denotes that the net trapped flux is oppositely directed to the original unperturbed flux at the x - point . as a result",
    ", we see that the hot spot has now jumped to below the second loop , as predicted .",
    "the latter result resembles the conclusion reached observationally by gregory et al .",

    "rapid changes in hot spot location are indeed observed on cttss , a phenomenon impossible with a purely dipolar field ( or any other single higher order multipole ) .",
    "the discussion and calculation given above illustrate that such changes can only be explained by stellar fields that are complicated structures consisting of a mixture of multipoles .",
    "non - axial symmetry and time - dependence would add extra richness to this phenomenon .",
    "@xmath0 = 2@xmath165 : the converged solution for this case is plotted in figure 7 .",

    "the reason again lies in the oscillatory behaviour of the magnetic field .",
    "the x - point traps all the flux exterior to @xmath0 , as well as some fraction of the flux interior to it .",
    "since the null point at 3.25@xmath165 is exterior to @xmath0 = 2@xmath165 , many of the field lines swept into @xmath0 , from radii both interior and exterior to it , cancel out .",
    "thus far more flux needs to be swept into the x - region ( relative to the unperturbed flux residing there ) from radii interior to it , to offset this cancellation and support a stable funnel flow , than at say @xmath0 = 10@xmath165 , where no such field turnover exists ( either exterior to it or interior to it for radii @xmath210@xmath128 ) .",
    "this explains the much larger @xmath177 in the 2@xmath165 case . at the same time ,",
    "the field strength ( @xmath172 ) in the equatorial plane rises much more rapidly , i.e. , flux lines are much more tightly packed , with decreasing radius at 2@xmath165 than at 10@xmath165 ( figs . 2 , 3 ) .",
    "thus a relatively small excursion of the disk inward of @xmath0 = 2@xmath165 is required to capture the requisite flux for a steady - state solution .",

    "the value of @xmath177 is determined as the minimum required to have no `` frustrated '' field lines for steady funnel flow ( i.e. , no field line leaves the x - point on the `` downhill '' side of the critical equipotential , yet subsequently crosses it again so that a cold funnel flow would encounter an insurmountable potential barrier ; see os95 ) , while the eigenvalue @xmath178 is found by trial and error , given @xmath295 , by requiring the solution to satisfy the ideal y - field geometry near @xmath128 .",
    "the derived remainder field @xmath286 is then superimposed on the ( scaled ) @xmath285 and @xmath260 to obtain the total scaled solution @xmath107 from equation ( [ defphi ] ) . to solve equation ( [ solpde ] ) and its associated boundary conditions on a grid , we use the transformation ( @xmath88,@xmath25 ) @xmath174 ( @xmath88,@xmath296 ) , where @xmath296 @xmath152 2@xmath297[@xmath298 . here",

    "<S> previous analyses of magnetospheric accretion and outflow in classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) , within the context of both the x - wind model and other theoretical scenarios , have assumed a dipolar geometry for the stellar magnetic field if it were not perturbed by the presence of an accreting , electrically conducting disk . </S>",
    "<S> however , ctts surveys reveal that accretion hot spots cover a small fraction of the stellar surface , and that the net field polarization on the stellar surface is small . </S>",
    "<S> both facts imply that the magnetic field generated by the star has a complex non - dipolar structure . to address this discrepancy between theory and observations , we re - examine x - wind theory without the dipole constraint . using simple physical arguments based on the concept of trapped flux , </S>",
    "<S> we show that a dipole configuration is in fact not essential . </S>",
    "<S> independent of the precise geometry of the stellar magnetosphere , the requirement for a certain level of trapped flux predicts a definite relationship among various ctts observables . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , superposition of multipole stellar fields naturally yield small observed hot - spot covering fractions and small net surface polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> the generalized x - wind picture remains viable under these conditions , with the outflow from a small annulus near the inner disk edge little affected by the modified geometry , but with inflow highly dependent on the details of how the emergent stellar flux is linked and trapped by the inner disk regions . </S>",
    "<S> our model is consistent with data , including recent spectropolarimetric measurements of the hot spot sizes and field strengths in v2129 oph and bp tau . </S>"
