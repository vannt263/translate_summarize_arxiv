    ". then electron - phonon and electron - electron umklapp processes can be neglected .",
    "besides mediating possibly attractive interactions , the effect of phonons on the electronic system could in principle lead to two instabilities , namely the peierls transition @xcite and the wentzel - bardeen ( wb ) singularity @xcite .",
    "all these issues can be investigated by integrating out the phonons and studying the electron system alone , since the relevant backscattering electron - phonon interactions are weak @xcite .",
    "this is the approach taken in our paper .",
    "our treatment of phonons expands on recent work by suzuura and ando @xcite , where the field theory for _ acoustic phonons _ and their coupling to electrons in swnts was derived .",
    "optical phonons are ignored in this theory as well as in ours .",
    "this should create no major problem for the issues at stake here , since optical phonons do not produce sizeable attractive interactions nor a wb singularity .",
    "their relevance for the peierls transition is discussed briefly below .",
    "the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite is analytically tractable and , moreover , appears to be in excellent agreement with local - density - functional calculations even for ultrathin ( @xmath6   ) nanotubes @xcite .",
    "for instance , we find that the frequency of the breathing mode computed in ref.@xcite coincides to within @xmath7 with the value extracted from the continuum theory of ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the predicted value for the twist velocity @xmath8 below is consistent with refs .",
    "this is fortunate since previous estimates for the electron - phonon coupling @xcite were only qualitative in nature and did not even agree on orders of magnitude .",
    "for related theoretical work on acoustic phonons and electron - phonon interactions in swnts , see ref.@xcite .",
    "as we show in detail below , the phonon - mediated effective attraction among electrons is very strong for sufficiently thin nanotubes .",
    "the dominant phonon exchange processes involve two phonon modes , namely the stretching and the breathing mode .",
    "the stretching mode has a linear dispersion characterized by a velocity @xmath9 , while the breathing mode has a finite frequency @xmath10 at long wavelengths .",
    "following general arguments @xcite , for a large part of the relevant parameter space , the influence of the stretching mode is negligible .",
    "then the system can be described as a _ luttinger liquid _  ( ll ) with standard interaction parameter @xmath11 in the charged channel @xcite , where @xmath12 for noninteracting electrons .",

    "( [ geff ] ) and interaction parameters @xmath23 in the three neutral channels ( see below ) , is valid provided @xmath4 is sufficiently large compared to the `` critical radius '' @xmath24 , where @xmath1 is slightly larger than @xmath25 , @xmath26 . only in the immediate vicinity of this radius ,",
    "the retarded interaction mediated by the stretching phonon mode has to be kept explicitly .",
    "this critical radius defines the location of the so - called wentzel - bardeen ( wb ) singularity @xcite . for @xmath27 ,",
    "our model breaks down , and a transition to a phase - separated state is expected .",
    "previous work by loss and martin @xcite studied the wb singularity in detail for one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , but a concrete physical realization seemed out of reach due to the small ratio between sound and fermi velocity in all systems considered so far .",
    "we argue below that swnts with screened - off interactions may offer the possibility to reach this elusive singularity , which has never been observed experimentally .",
    "this is remarkable since the ratio between sound and fermi velocity is still small .",
    "however , in a swnt the stretching and the breathing phonon modes collaborate in driving the system towards the wb singularity in a very efficient manner .",
    "moreover , the closeness to the wb singularity holds responsible for rather strong superconducting fluctuations . from our theory , estimates for the attractive interactions generated via phonon exchange are obtained . to describe most of the issues raised by the experiments of refs.@xcite in a quantitative way",

    "the standard 1d ginzburg - landau description can be obtained @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the phonon - mediated electron - electron interaction within a given nanotube , and postpone a full discussion of experimentally relevant quantities to a future publication @xcite .",
    "the present paper also sheds light on the recent discussion about the possibility of a peierls transition in swnts @xcite .",
    "notably , even in the incommensurate situation studied here , in principle a peierls transition can occur @xcite , although the resulting pseudogap is expected to be wiped out by quantum fluctuations @xcite . within a mean - field approximation , the peierls transition due to optical phonons has been studied in refs.@xcite , resulting in a kekul - type modulation .",
    "since we only treat acoustic phonons , we have nothing to say about this issue .",
    "however , recent theoretical work including acoustic phonons has pointed out the possibility of a sizeable peierls gap in thin armchair swnts @xcite .",
    "this peierls modulation was found to correspond to a twist distortion of the swnt .",
    "below we study arbitrary metallic swnts , and indeed confirm that the relevant peierls distortion for an armchair swnt would correspond to a tube twisting .",
    "in addition , we find the proper mode for any metallic swnt .",
    "our findings follow from analyzing backscattering phonon exchange , which operates at the doping - dependent wavevector @xmath28 , where @xmath29 . based on our essentially exact results",
    ", we do not expect that the peierls transition predicted in ref.@xcite is observable , at least not for an individual swnt away from the neutrality point . according to our theory ,",
    "a peierls gap in the 1d sense @xcite could only be possible for very thin swnts and under rather stringent conditions .",

    "this renormalization represents a direct generalization of the one / two - channel theory of voit and schulz @xcite to the four - channel case of interest here .",
    "we do not give any details here , since the relevant dimensionless coupling constant is @xmath226 , and the resulting renormalizations are again of order @xmath208 , i.e. unobservable .",
    "nevertheless , we confirm the finding of ref.@xcite that the relevant peierls distortion mode for armchair swnts is given by a twist distortion , see eq .",
    "( [ cdw ] ) . for arbitrary chiral angle @xmath91 ,",
    "however , the relevant distortion involves a linear combination of all three phonon modes .",
    "finally , we mention that on half - filling , the oscillatory contribution could survive .",

    "( [ cdw2 ] ) to be a relevant perturbation .",
    "provided @xmath227 , one could possibly expect a small ( twist ) peierls gap in this nearly commensurate situation , see ref.@xcite .",
    "however , this would require a detailed analysis of additional phonon exchange processes neglected above due to incommensurability .",
    "away from half - filling , we do not see a possibility for this gap to survive .",
    "in this paper , we have studied acoustic phonon exchange mechanisms operating in an individual metallic swnt .",
    "the description of phonons within an elastic continuum model allows for explicit analytical progress , and we have shown that integrating out the phonon system can produce very substantial attractive electron - electron interactions . for sufficiently large tube radius , the system can be described by a standard luttinger liquid theory , where the interaction parameter @xmath11 is renormalized away from the value @xmath228 describing the theory without phonons but fully taking into account coulomb interactions .",
    "we have shown that @xmath19 corresponding to attractive interactions is possible , in particular once the coulomb interactions are externally screened .",
    "these attractive interactions are basically mediated via a breathing phonon mode . for thin swnts ,",
    "one also has to take into account a retarded branch describing a stretching mode .",
    "the combined effect of the stretching and the breathing mode then produces a wentzel - bardeen singularity at a critical radius @xmath229   .",
    "nanotubes may then offer the possibility to reach this singularity in experiments .",
    "remarkably , all other mechanisms , e.g. backscattering phonon exchange , turn out to be remarkable inefficient in mediating effective electron - electron interactions .",
    "in particular , based on our analysis , it should be extraordinarily difficult to observe traces of the peierls transition . as our treatment is essentially exact ,",
    "we believe that this also invalidates some earlier theories that were mainly based on mean - field approximations .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the phonon - mediated attractive interaction can only drive the system into a true superconducting phase if inter - tube couplings are taken into account .",
    "this will be studied in detail elsewhere @xcite . in order to gain preliminary insights about inter - tube phonon exchange effects in a rope of swnts or a multi - wall nanotube ,",
    "let us briefly contemplate a simplified model of two parallel swnts and study phonon exchange in the presence of elastic couplings between both tubes .",

    "the interaction parameters are @xmath245 where @xmath246 .",
    "there are now two types of superconducting order parameters .",
    "focusing on the most important singlet superconducting fluctuations , there is one operator describing a cooper pair on the same tube , @xmath247 , and another one where the electrons forming the cooper pair reside on different tubes , @xmath248 , with explicit form @xmath249 where @xmath250 is the electron spinor on tube @xmath251 from eq .",
    "( [ sc+ ] ) , the scaling dimensions of these operators follow as @xmath252 two conclusions can be drawn from the inspection of these scaling dimensions .",
    "first , for inter - tube couplings with @xmath253 sufficiently larger than @xmath254 , attractive interactions within a given tube are increased .",
    "second , whenever @xmath255 , which holds true in the absence of coulomb interactions , the intra - tube superconducting order parameter is always more relevant than the inter - tube one .",
    "in other words , we expect that _ cooper pairs predominantly form on a given tube _ but not across different tubes .",
    "remarkably , this conclusion does not depend on the values of @xmath256 .",
    "clearly , this finding will be important in the theoretical analysis of experiments on swnt ropes and related systems .",
    "finally , we briefly address the role of electron - electron backscattering that has been neglected in our study . from ref .",
    "@xcite , backscattering is expected to open tiny gaps that depend exponentially on the radius @xmath4 .",
    "while for @xmath257   , the gap is extremely small and of no relevance in practice , for ultrathin tubes",
    "( @xmath6   ) the gaps may be more important .",
    "however , in this limit also the bandstructure may change in a profound way due to hybridization of @xmath258 and @xmath259 orbitals , and the analysis of ref.@xcite can not simply be taken over .",
    "in addition , the presence of the wentzel - bardeen singularity poses an intrinsic lower limit to the validity and self - consistency of our effective low - energy approach . with the predicted value @xmath229  ",
