    "1989 ) also found a small contribution from the g5v secondary component .",
    "simon et al . ( 1980 ) observed a uv flare on ux ari and found that chromospheric lines were enhanced 2.5 times their quiescent level , while transition region lines displayed an enhancement by a factor of up to 5.5 .",
    "they proposed an activity scenario for long - lived rs cvn flares in which the component stars have large corotating flux tubes which occasionally interact .",
    "the resulting magnetic reconnection leads to flares .",
    "recently , henry & newsom ( 1996 ) have detected , with photometric observations , an optical flare in this system .    in this paper , we report the detection of an optical flare in ux ari through simultaneous observations of the chromospheric h@xmath0 and he  i d@xmath3 lines .",

    "observations of ux ari in the h@xmath0 and he  i d@xmath3 line regions have been obtained during three nights ( 1995 september 13 - 15 ) with the isaac newton telescope ( int ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( la palma , spain ) using the intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) with grating h1800v , camera 500 and a 1024  x  1024 pixel tek3 ccd as detector .",
    "the reciprocal dispersion achieved is 0.24   / pixel which yields a spectral resolution of 0.48  @xmath4 and a useful wavelength range of 250  @xmath4 centered at 6563@xmath4 ( h@xmath0 ) and 5876@xmath4 ( hei d@xmath3 ) respectively .",
    "the spectra have been extracted using the standard reduction procedures in the iraf package ( bias subtraction , flat - field division , and optimal extraction of the spectra ) .",
    "the wavelength calibration was obtained by taking spectra of a cu - ar lamp .",
    "finally , the spectra have been normalized by fitting a continuum .",
    "we have obtained the chromospheric contribution in h@xmath0 and he  i d@xmath3 lines using the spectral subtraction technique described in detail by montes et al .",

    "our spectra in the h@xmath0 line region at orbital phases 0.42 , 0.44 ( september 13 ) , 0.58 ( september 14 ) and 0.74 ( september 15 ) are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot_paphahe ] . strong emission from the cool component is present in all the phases .",
    "the observed spectra exhibit photospheric absorption lines from both components shifted in agreement with orbital phases , being more intense the corresponding to the cooler component , however the relative contribution of each component to the total spectrum is not according to that obtained with the spectral types and radii given in cabs ( 0.07/0.93 ) . to obtain a satisfactory fit between the observed and synthesized spectra is necessary to take a relative contribution of 0.30/0.70 to the hot and cool components .",
    "this indicates that the radii given for these stars are wrong and/or that when a large fraction of the k0iv star s surface is covered by spots , the contribution of the g5v star is larger ( see raveendran & mohin 1995 ) . in the latter case the relative contribution of the components may change with time , which is in accordance with the different contributions that we used in previous observations of this system ( montes et al .",
    "1995b ,  c ) .    in table  1",
    "we list the parameters measured in the subtracted h@xmath0 spectra : the peak emission intensity , i ; the full width at half maximum , fwhm ; the excess emission equivalent width , ew ; the surface flux , @xmath6 , obtained with the calibration of pasquini & pallavicini ( 1991 ) as a function of ( v - r ) and the luminosity , l , obtained with the radius given in cabs .    at 0.74 orbital phase",
    "the emission intensity shows a remarkable enhancement with respect to the other phases . the excess h@xmath0 emission equivalent width increases in about a factor of 2 in an interval of 1 day .",
    "this fact suggests that we have detected a flare since enhancements of this amount during flares are typical of chromospheric emission lines ( simon et al .",
    "1980 , catalano & frasca 1994 ) .",
    "the ew obtained in the three other spectra ( that we have considered as quiescent level ) are similar to that measured by us on 1992 december 16 ( montes et al .",
    "1995b ) and similar to the values given in the literature .",
    "the energy released in the flare , 1.7 10@xmath10 erg  s@xmath9 ( ew in the flare spectrum converted into luminosity ) is of the same order of magnitude than the maximum h@xmath0 luminosity observed in the h@xmath0 flares of other rs cvn systems , v711 tau ( foing et al .",
    "1993 ) and hk lac ( catalano & frasca 1994 ) .",
    "the subtracted spectra show than the emission corresponds only to the cooler component ( k0iv ) and the h@xmath0 profile presents broad wings , which are much more remarkable in the flare spectrum .",
    "a gaussian fit to the subtracted spectrum is not well matched , therefore we fit the profile using two gaussian components : a narrow one having a fwhm of 60 - 79 km  s@xmath9 and a broad component whose fwhm ranges from 133 to 247 km  s@xmath9 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot_papha_n_b ] we have represented the subtracted spectrum at phase 0.74 and the corresponding narrow and broad components used to perform the fit . in table",
    "1 we give the parameters of the narrow and broad gaussian components used in each spectrum .",
    "as we can see the large changes in the strength of the h@xmath0 emission , from the quiescent level to the flare level , occur primarily in the broad component , a similar behaviour has been observed in the case of dm uma by hatzes ( 1995 ) . since in a solar flare large scale mass motions occur , a large flare in ux ari may explain the increase of the h@xmath0 emission and the broad wings observed in our spectrum .    in the na  i d@xmath1 ,",
    "d@xmath2 , and he  i d@xmath3 lines region we have obtained three spectra at orbital phases 0.44 ( september 13 ) , 0.57 ( sept .",
    "14 ) and 0.74 ( sept . 15 ) , being quasi - simultaneous to the h@xmath0 observations .",
    "the he  i d@xmath3 line appears in emission only at 0.74 phase ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : plot_paphahe ] ) corresponding to the increase of the emission observed in the h@xmath0 line .",
    "this fact supports the detection of a flare - like event , since in the sun the he  i d@xmath3 line appears as absorption in plage and weak flares and as emission in strong flares ( zirin 1988 ) .",
    "the he  i d@xmath3 line has been also observed in emission at 0.22 , 0.26 , 0.77 orbital phases in the rs cvn system ii  peg by huenemoerder & ramsey ( 1987 ) and huenemoerder et al .",
    "we have also seen in ii  peg the he  i d@xmath3 line in emission in one spectrum at 0.76 orbital phase taken on 1995 september 14 ( paper in preparation ) .",
    "we have applied to this spectral region the spectral subtraction technique in the same way as for the h@xmath0 line .",
    "the excess he  i d@xmath3 emission ew obtained in the flare spectrum ( @xmath5=0.74 ) is 0.140  . in the other two spectra",
    "only a very small absorption seems to be present . in the case of the na  i d@xmath1 and d@xmath2 lines we observe a filled - in absorption lines from the cool component in the three spectra , which is slightly larger in the flare spectrum ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "these lines have been observed in emission or as a filled - in in red dwarf flare stars ( pettersen et al .",
    "1984 ; pettersen 1989 ) . as na",
    "i resonance lines are collisionally - controlled in the atmospheres of late - type stars , the filled  -  in observed may provide information about chromospheric emission .",
    "we have shown here that the ux ari binary system exhibits a strong increase in the h@xmath0 ew at 0.74 orbital phase . in the same phase",
    "the he  i d@xmath3 appears in emission , and the na  i d@xmath1 and d@xmath2 lines show a larger filled - in than in the other phases .",
    "this behaviour yields us to the conclusion that we have detected a flare which released about 1.7  10@xmath10  erg  s@xmath9 in the h@xmath0 line .",
    "according to the magnetic loop model for ux ari described by simon et al .",
    "( 1980 ) in which the component stars have large corotating flux tubes which occasionally interact , the resulting magnetic reconnection leads to flares .",
    "when the emitting regions are seen in projection against the stellar disk the he  i d@xmath3 line appears in absorption , when the regions are observed off the stellar limb he  i d@xmath3 can be seen in emission .",
    "the orbital phase ( 0.74 ) of our ux ari observation and its symmetrical position are the most favourable to observe the he  i d@xmath3 line in emission .",
    "the other he  i d@xmath3 observations in emission in ii  peg are also seen at these orbital phases .",
    "this fact together with the strong increase in the h@xmath0 ew and the larger filled - in of the nai d@xmath1 and d@xmath2 lines at 0.74 orbital phase support the presence of a flare in the ux ari binary system .    photometric observations of this system indicate that the light curve minimum ( due to cool spots ) normally occurred between phase 0.6 - 0.9 ( raveendran & mohin 1995 and references therein ) , on the other hand rodon & cutispoto ( 1992 ) observed an anticorrelation between the v light curve and the u - b and b - v colours variations that is not consistent with the expected variations produced by the presence of cool spots alone , and might be due to continuous flaring activity or bright plage - like regions associated with the spots .",
    "our flare observation occurs at phase 0.74 , so the flare eruption could be produced ( as have been observed in the largest solar flares ) by the interaction of new emerging magnetic flux with old magnetic structures associated to the spot groups present in the star at this phase ."
