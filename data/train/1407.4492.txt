    "the problem of constructing global - in - time solutions for small initial data has been studied intensively in the literature .",
    "the purpose of the current paper is to propose a large cauchy data regime for which also leads to global classical solutions .",
    "we discuss briefly the small data theory for on @xmath13 .",
    "the idea is to use the decay mechanism of linear waves , i.e. solutions of @xmath14 , and treat the nonlinear problem as a perturbation of the linear waves . in dimensions greater than @xmath15 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath16 , the pointwise decay rate of linear waves is at least @xmath17 , which is integrable on for @xmath18 .",
    "this fast decay rate can be used to prove the small - data - global - existence results ; see the pioneering works of klainerman @xcite and @xcite . however , in @xmath0 , the pointwise decay of the linear wave is merely at the rate @xmath19 which is not integrable .",
    "this weak decay rate is not enough to control the nonlinear interaction : f. john @xcite showed that there were quadratic forms ( which do not satisfy the null condition ) such that for arbitrarily small non - zero smooth data , solutions to blow up in finite time .",
    "+ the importance of the null condition was first observed in the breakthrough work @xcite by klainerman , where he proved that small data lead to global - in - time classical solutions if the nonlinearity q is a _",
    "null form , which will be defined explicitly later _ , or equivalently , satisfies the null condition . in @xcite christodoulou",
    "obtained a similar result based on the conformal compactification of the minkowski spacetime .",
    "although the approaches in @xcite and @xcite are very different , both proofs rely on the cancellation structure of null condition , which is absent for general quadratic nonlinearities .",
    "+ the idea of exploiting the cancellation structure of the null conditions can also be used to handle certain large data problems . in a recent breakthrough in general relativity",
    ", christodoulou @xcite rigorously proved for the first time that black - holes can form dynamically from arbitrarily dispersed initial data .",
    "the key to this work was the new idea of the `` short pulse method '' . roughly speaking ,",
    "this is a choice of special large initial data , called _ short pulse _ data , so that these large profiles can be propagated along the flow of einstein vacuum equations .",
    "one of the key observations in the proof is still tightly related to the cancellation of the null structure : the profile is only large in certain components and these large components are always coupled with some small components so that their contributions are still manageable .",
    "christodoulou s work has been generalized in @xcite by klainerman and rodnianski .",
    "a key ingredient in their work is the relaxed propagation estimates which allows profiles with more large components .",
    "+ the ideas used in @xcite and @xcite have been adapted to the main equation by wang and yu to construct future - in - time global solutions with large initial data ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their approach is indirect .",
    "the authors essentially impose the characteristic data on the past null infinity and solve the inverse scattering problem all the way up to a finite time to construct the initial cauchy data . very recently ,",
    "yang @xcite has obtained a global existence theorem for semi - linear wave equations with large cauchy initial energy .",
    "the largeness in @xcite is from a slower decay of the initial data at spatial infinity , but not from the short pulse method .",

    "we remark that compared to the characteristic data approach in @xcite , one of the main difficulties is to prove quantitative decay of the solution .",
    "this difficulty does not appear in @xcite , because the data there are radiation fields given on the past null infinity , so that the decay rate is already explicitly given .",
    "we will give a more - detailed comparison of the present work and @xcite after some necessary notations are introduced .",
    "we use @xmath20 to denote the standard cartesian coordinates @xmath21 on @xmath0 . in particular , @xmath22 stands for @xmath23 .",

    "in particular , we always write the main equation as .",
    "we remark that in order to simplify some of the expressions appearing in the proof of the main theorem , we give the initial data at @xmath35 rather than @xmath36 . because of the invariance of the equation under time translations , this is the same as giving data on @xmath37 .    before describing the short pulse data ,",
    "we introduce some notations : @xmath38 and @xmath39 are used to denote the usual radial and angular coordinates on @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be a small positive constant which will be determined later .",
    "we identify the @xmath42 hypersurface with @xmath43 and divide it into three parts : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the ball centered at the origin with radius @xmath38 .    in the following",

    "the width of the pulse is @xmath71 and its amplitude is @xmath72 , which is very large relative to the width if @xmath41 is small .",
    "the choice of @xmath73 looks obscure and artificial in the above form .",
    "in fact , we have a natural geometric explanation of this choice , which can also serve as heuristics to understand why one expects a global - in - time solution .    [",
    "geometric interpretation of the short pulse data ] in terms of the solution @xmath3 , it is easy to observe from our initial data that @xmath74 we will prove that if @xmath41 is small enough , the smallness indicated by can be propagated by showing    @xmath75    here we use @xmath76 to denote the hypersurface @xmath77 . recall that @xmath78 is the normal ( with respect to the minkowski metric ! ) of the outgoing light cones @xmath79 in @xmath0 .",
    "if we integrate @xmath80 on such an outgoing light cone @xmath47 , the quantity @xmath81 measures the incoming energy through this light cone . therefore , since @xmath41 will be eventually very small , the choice of @xmath82 is to keep the incoming energy as small as possible .",
    "intuitively , we expect all the energy will be emanated in the outgoing direction so that the solution @xmath3 disperses .",
    "we now explain in what sense the short pulse data are large .",
    "it appears that the short pulse data is at least small in the @xmath83 sense due to the presence of the factor @xmath41 .",
    "first of all , we notice that the @xmath83 norm is irrelevant since we may always add a constant to get a new solution for .",
    "the size of the data should be measured at least on the the level of first derivatives .",
    "secondly , we notice that , if we take derivatives in the @xmath84 direction many times , the data can be extremely large in the @xmath83 sense , because each @xmath84 derivative will bring out a @xmath85 factor from the first argument of @xmath86 or @xmath82 .    a more natural way to see the largeness of the data is to consider the energy spaces , i.e. the sobolev spaces @xmath87 . the critical @xmath88-exponent ( with respect to scaling ) of is @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath90 order energy @xmath91 is subcritical and the @xmath92 order energy @xmath93 is supercritical .",
    "here we use @xmath94 to denote spatial gradient .",
    "we can compute the @xmath90 order energy @xmath95 and the @xmath92 order energy @xmath96 as follows : @xmath97 since @xmath95 and @xmath96 are subcritical and supercritical , respectively , we can not make both of them small by the scaling invariance of the equation .",
    "it is in this sense that the data are large at the level of energy .",
    "moreover , for all @xmath98 , we can show that @xmath99 we note in passing that the higher order energies can be extremely large . also , we remark that the symbol @xmath100 depends only on an absolute constant .",
    "we are now ready to state the main theorem of the paper :    for any given pair of short pulse data @xmath101 as above , let us consider the following system of wave equations @xmath102 where the @xmath27 s are null forms",
    ".    then there exists an absolute positive number @xmath103 , so that for all @xmath104 , the above cauchy problem admits a unique smooth solution @xmath3 with lifespan @xmath105 .",
    "moreover , when @xmath106 , the nonlinear wave @xmath3 scatters .",
    "we review the basic geometry of minkowski space @xmath0 .",

    "the following picture depicts the outgoing null foliation @xmath125 of @xmath117 :    since the foliation is spherically symmetric , we only draw the @xmath127 and @xmath38 components in the schematic diagram .",

    "two outgoing cones @xmath129 and @xmath130 divide @xmath0 into three regions : the small data region , i.e. region i in the picture , the short pulse region , i.e. the region with light grey color , region ii in the picture , and the region iii in the picture , i.e. the region with dark grey color .",
    "recall that the short pulse data prescribed on @xmath50 in the last subsection are identically zero for @xmath131 , therefore , according to the weak huygen s principle , the solution of the main equation vanishes identically in the region iii ( dark grey ) . in particular , the solution @xmath3 ( if it exists ) and its derivatives vanish on @xmath132 .",
    "we now pay more attention to the short pulse region ( region ii with light grey color ) .",

    ", we also remark that the choice of the short pulse data is also adapted to the double null foliation in the short pulse region : the data is chosen in a way that very little energy propagates in the incoming direction through @xmath125 s .",
    "we expect most of the energy will radiate through the @xmath119 s to the future null infinity .    for a given @xmath121-sphere @xmath123",
    ", we use @xmath140 to denote the induced metric from the minkowski metric on @xmath123 .",
    "the intrinsic covariant derivative on @xmath123 is denoted by @xmath141 .",
    "this covariant derivative is closely related to the rotational symmetry of @xmath0 .",
    "recall that the infinitesimal rotations are represented by the following three vector fields:@xmath142 we use @xmath143 as a short hand notation for an arbitrary choice from the above vector fields .",

    ", we use @xmath147 to denote @xmath148 and use @xmath149 to denote @xmath150 , and so on .",

    "this makes the proof difficult and also different from the classical small data problem .",
    "the decay of derivatives of @xmath3 is another difficulty which will be explained in detail in section [ main features of the proof ] . *",
    "smallness of @xmath3 on @xmath130 .",

    "this is equivalent to multiplying @xmath162 by @xmath171 and then integrating by parts .",
    "this is the reason that we call @xmath166 a _ multiplier _ vector field .    in the short pulse region",
    "ii , we integrate on @xmath133 . since @xmath3 and its derivatives vanish on @xmath129 , this yields @xmath172(x , l)+\\int_{\\cb_{\\ub } } \\mathbb{t}[\\phi](x,\\lb )   = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{\\sigma_{1 } } \\mathbb{t}[\\phi](x , l+\\lb ) + \\doubleint_{d_{\\ub , u } }   k^x [ \\phi ] + \\phi \\cdot x \\phi.\\ ] ] where @xmath160 is the initial cauchy hypersurface @xmath50 .    in the short pulse region",

    "we remark that indices @xmath185 and @xmath186 are used to denote a frame on @xmath187 and we only listed the nonzero components of the deformation tensors .",

    "the existence of solutions of follows immediately from the a priori energy estimates derived previously .",
    "since the procedure is standard , we only give a sketch of the proof in this subsection .",
    "we start with solving local solution for cauchy problem with data prescribed on @xmath217 with @xmath627 .",
    "therefore , we obtain a local solution confined in the region bounded by @xmath130 and @xmath628 . in particular , on a neighborhood of @xmath240 on the incoming cone @xmath628 , the solution has been constructed .",

    "since the a priori energy estimates ( as well as the companying @xmath83 estimates ) depends only on the size @xmath285 of the rescaled data on @xmath160 , this solution is well behaved on @xmath632 .",
    "therefore , we can use this as initial surface ( instead of @xmath160 ) to repeat the above argument .",
    "eventually , we obtain an solution in the entire short pulse region .",

    "more precisely , we will prove that    [ improved estimates on c delta ] on @xmath130 , for sufficiently small @xmath41 , we have @xmath636    notice the power of @xmath41 for @xmath347 has been modified to @xmath637 . since @xmath129 is also the outer boundary of the small data region ( region i ) , the smallness ( in terms of @xmath41 ) of the solution stated in the proposition is indispensable for the construction of a global solution in the small data region . as we mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the proof relies on the following observation : on the @xmath239 or equivalently the lower boundary of @xmath130 , the data are _ identically zero_. this is because that the data are compactly supported on @xmath160 between @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",

    "the idea of the proof is to integrate along the @xmath250 direction to show that the smallness indeed propagates .",
