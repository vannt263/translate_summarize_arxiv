    "quasi - normal modes ( qnm ) are classical perturbations with non - vanishing damping propagating in a given gravitational background subject to specific boundary conditions .",
    "the frequency and damping of these oscillations depend only on the parameters characterizing the black hole and are completely independent of the particular initial configuration that caused the excitation of such vibrations . over the last three decades ,",

    "@xcite )    during the last few years there has been renewed interest in qnm for the following two reasons . first , in estimating the thermalization time - scales in connection with the ads / cft conjecture @xcite .",
    "secondly , and more importantly , it has been conjectured recently that the real part of the qn frequencies for black - hole perturbations ( @xmath4 ) correspond to the minimum energy change of a black - hole undergoing quantum transitions @xcite .",
    "earlier , bekenstein @xcite had conjectured using semi - classical arguments that the black - hole area spectrum is equispaced and is of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an integer to be determined and @xmath7 is the planck length .",
    "this implies that for a @xmath8dimensional schwarzschild black - hole , the energy @xmath9 emitted when the black - hole looses one quantum of the area is = = ( k)t_h , [ eq : freq ] where @xmath10 is the horizon and @xmath11 is the hawking temperature .",
    "hod @xcite noticed , based on the numerical result @xcite , that the qnm spectrum for the schwarzschild black - hole has a frequency whose real part numerically approached eq .",
    "( [ eq : freq ] ) with @xmath12 in the limit of infinite imaginary frequency .",
    "this was later confirmed analytically by motl @xcite for @xmath13-dimensional schwarzschild , who showed that the qn frequencies have the following structure : _ _ qnm = 2 i t_h (n + ) + t_h ( 3 ) + o(n^-1/2 ) .",

    "together , this also led to the microscopic entropy of the black - hole to be one quarter its horizon area ( in planck units ) . turning the argument around , ( [ eq : arean ] ) and ( [ mn01 ] )",
    "can also be used to vindicate the point of view that horizon area is equispaced @xcite .    subsequently , motl and neitzke @xcite ( see also ref .",

    "@xcite ) , and there appears to be pieces of evidence in favour of as well as against the predictions referred to above .",

    "@xcite that the frequencies determined by the monodromies ( of the two horizons ) coincide with the qnm of the near horizon btz metric and that these are the ones that are relevant for quantum gravity ( the so called ` non - quasinormal modes ' )",

    "in this paper , we have computed the high frequency qnm for scalar perturbations of spherically symmetric single horizon and asymptotically flat black - holes in @xmath18dimensional space - times .",

    "we have shown that the real part of these modes depends on the horizon radius ( @xmath10 ) , dimension ( @xmath17 ) and the power - law index ( @xmath58 ) of @xmath19 near the singularity .",
    "we have also shown that the real part of the high frequency modes has a logarithmic dependence , although the argument of the logarithm is not necessarily an integer . however , when we applied our result to specific examples and obtained their qnm , the argument turned out to be an integer .",
    "in particular , for @xmath60-dimensional schwarzschild and @xmath132-dimensional stringy black - holes , we found that the real part of the qn frequencies is proportional to @xmath102 .",

    "for black - holes with non - zero hawking temperature , it follows from ( [ mainresult ] ) that the real part of qn frequencies is of the form : ( _qnm ) = t_h  .",
    "[ eq : reom ] identifying the above with the minimum change of black - hole mass ( due to hawking radiation or accretion ) , we get , using the first law of black - hole thermodynamics and the area law for entropy : a = 4 ^2  , [ eq : darea ] where @xmath134 is the horizon area of the black - hole and @xmath7 is the @xmath18dimensional planck length in this case . equating with the minimum area quantum in loop quantum gravity , namely @xmath135 and subsequently setting @xmath103",
    ", we get the following prediction for the immirzi parameter : =  , where @xmath136 denotes the representation of @xmath16 for the spin - network states in loop quantum gravity ( for super - symmetric spin networks the area spectrum is derived in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . assuming that the number of points where the spin - network states puncture the horizon is given by : n = a / a one gets the microscopic entropy of the black - hole , as the logarithm of the dimension of the boundary hilbert space , to be s & = & n ( 1 + 2j_m ) + & = & thus , for the above relation to agree with the bekenstein - hawking entropy , one must have : j_m = ( ( q-1 ) )  .",
    "[ eq : jm ] even though , for @xmath137 , ( [ eq : jm ] ) agrees with the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite , one would like to have a better understanding of the above result . more importantly ,",
    "the above result is valid _ only _ for non - extremal black - holes . since @xmath138 for the extremal black - holes , the real part of the qn frequencies ( [ eq : reom ] ) can not be related to the temperature implying that the relation for the change in the horizon area ( [ eq : darea ] ) is no more valid .",
    "we hope to address this issue elsewhere .",
    "finally , following @xcite we find that the adiabatic invariant in our case is : i & = & + & = & ()^-1   + & = & ()^-1 s  , which again confirms bekenstein s conjecture that horizon area ( and hence black - hole entropy ) is an adiabatic invariant .",
    "the crucial ingredient in the above is : ( _qnm ) t_h  .",
    "this , along with the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule @xmath139 implies the equispaced nature of the horizon spectrum : a n  ^d  , with the following proportionality constant : 4 ()^-1 such equispaced spectrum has been verified earlier in several other approaches , albeit with different proportionality constants and often with a ` zero - point ' or ` ground state ' energy , interpreted as a planck - sized remnant left over when the black - hole evaporates ( see for e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note from ( [ eq : omern ] ) and the relation @xmath140 that the relation @xmath141 continues to hold for extremal reissner - nrdstrom .",
    "we end with a couple of caveats : ( i ) the area spectrum in loop quantum gravity is not equispaced in general @xcite .",
    "however , it is equispaced in the large area limit , as well as if one uses a different representation @xcite .",
    "( ii ) strictly speaking , the qnm are only associated with transitions of short durations .",
    "thus , other transitions can modify the equispaced area spectrum obtained here .",
