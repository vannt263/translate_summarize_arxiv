    "more than 30 years ago t hooft @xcite explored some of the physical consequences of topological structures @xcite in non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "the issues are directly tied to chiral anomalies , and the phenomena discussed ranged from the mass of the @xmath0 meson to the existence of baryon decay in the standard model .",
    "the latter effect is too small for observation ; nevertheless , the fact that it must exist is crucial for any fundamental formulation of the theory . in particular",
    ", it must appear in any valid attempt to formulate the standard model on the lattice @xcite .",
    "although the underpinnings of these ideas have been established for some time , recent controversies strikingly show that the issues are not fully understood .",
    "for example , the rooting algorithm used to adjust the number of quark flavors in the staggered fermion lattice algorithm is inconsistent with the expected form of the t hooft vertex @xcite .",
    "this has led to a rather bitter controversy involving a large subset of the lattice gauge community @xcite .",
    "a second dispute involves the speculation that a vanishing up quark mass might solve the strong cp problem .",
    "the t hooft vertex gives rise to non - perturbative contributions to the renormalization group flow of quark masses @xcite .",
    "when the quark masses are non - degenerate , these involve an additive shift and show that the vanishing of a single quark mass is renormalization scheme dependent .",
    "as such it can not be a fundamental concept @xcite .",
    "this conflicts with the conventional perturbative arguments that the renormalization of fermion masses is purely multiplicative , something that is only true for multiple degenerate flavors . nevertheless , various attempts to go beyond the standard model often continue to attempt to build in a vanishing up - quark mass as an escape from the strong cp problem ; for a few examples see @xcite .",
    "all these issues are closely tied to quantum anomalies and axial symmetries .",
    "indeed , when expressed in terms of the t hooft interaction , the qualitative resolution of most of these effects becomes fairly obvious .",
    "the fact that lingering controversies continue suggests that it is worthwhile to revisit the underpinnings of the mechanism .",
    "that is the purpose of this paper .",
    "although the mechanism applies also to the weak interactions through the predicted baryon decay , here i will restrict my discussion to the strong interactions of quarks and gluons .",
    "no single item in this discussion is new in and of itself .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to elucidate their unification through the t hooft interaction .",
    "i will occasionally use lattice language for convenience , such as referring to an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath1 as a `` lattice spacing . ''",
    "nevertheless , the issues are in not specific to lattice gauge theory .",
    "the topic is basic non - perturbative issues within the standard quark confining dynamics of the strong interactions .",
    "i will rely heavily on chiral symmetries , and only assume that i have a well regulated theory that maintains these symmetries to a good approximation .",
    "i organize the discussion as follows .",
    "section [ vertex ] starts with a review of how the t hooft effective interaction arises and discusses some of its general properties . in section [ etamass ]",
    "i turn to the historically most significant use of the effect , the connection to the @xmath0 mass .",
    "the robustness of the zero modes responsible for the vertex is discussed in section [ index ] .",
    "the remainder of the paper goes through a variety of other physical consequences that are perhaps somewhat less familiar .",
    "section [ reps ] explores the discrete chiral symmetries that appear with quarks in higher representations than the fundamental , as motivated by some unified models .",
    "section [ theta ] discusses how the effective vertex is tied to the well known possibility of cp violation in the strong interactions through a non - trivial phase in the quark mass matrix .",
    "section [ mu ] connects the vertex to the ill posed nature of proposing a vanishing up quark mass to solve the strong cp problem . building on this ,",
    "section [ kaplanmanohar ] relates this result to the effective chiral lagrangian ambiguity discussed by kaplan and manohar @xcite . in section [ axions ]",
    "i briefly discuss the axion solution to the strong cp problem , noting that the axion does acquire a mass from the anomaly but observing that as long as the coupling of the axion to the strong interactions is small this mass along with inherited cp violating effects will naturally be small . in section [ rooting ]",
    "i discuss why the rooting procedure used in lattice gauge theory with staggered quarks mutilates the interaction , thus introducing an uncontrolled approximation .",
    "finally , the basic conclusions are summarized in section [ summary ] .",
    "i begin with a brief reminder of the strategy of lattice simulations .",
    "consider the basic path integral , or `` partition function , '' for quarks and gluons @xmath2 here @xmath3 denotes the gauge fields and @xmath4 the quark fields .",
    "the pure gauge part of the action is @xmath5 and the matrix describing the fermion part of the action is @xmath6 .",
    "since direct numerical evaluation of the fermionic integrals appears to be impractical , the grassmann integrals are conventionally evaluated analytically , reducing the partition function to @xmath7 here @xmath8 denotes the determinant of the dirac matrix evaluated in the given gauge field .",
    "thus motivated , the basic lattice strategy is to generate a set of random gauge configurations weighted by @xmath9 . given an ensemble of such configurations , one then estimates physical observables by averages over this ensemble .",
    "this procedure seems innocent enough , but it can run into trouble when one has massless fermions and corresponding chiral symmetries . to see the issue , write the determinant as a product of the eigenvalues @xmath10 of the matrix @xmath11 . in general @xmath11 may not be a normal matrix ; so , one should pick either left or right eigenvectors at one s discretion .",
    "this is a technical detail that will not play any further role here . in order to control infrared issues with massless quarks ,",
    "let me introduce a small explicit mass @xmath12 and reduce the path integral to @xmath13    now suppose we have a configuration where one of the eigenvalues of @xmath6 vanishes , _",
    "i.e. _ assume that some @xmath14 . as we take the mass to zero , any configurations involving such an eigenvalue will drop out of the ensemble .",
    "at first one might suspect this would be a set of measure zero in the space of all possible gauge fields .",
    "however , as discussed later , the index theorem ties gauge field topology to such zero modes of the dirac operator .",
    "this shows that such modes can be robust under small deformations of the fields . under the traditional lattice strategy",
    "these configurations have zero weight in the massless limit .",
    "the naive conclusion is that such configurations are irrelevant to physics in the chiral limit .",
    "it was this reasoning that t hooft showed to be incorrect .",
    "indeed , he demonstrated that it is natural for some observables to have @xmath15 factors when zero modes are present .",
    "these can cancel the terms linear in @xmath12 from the determinant , leaving a finite contribution .    as a simple example , consider the quark condensate @xmath16 here @xmath17 represents the system volume , inserted to give an intensive quantity .",
    "expressing the fermionic factors in terms of the eigenvalues of @xmath11 reduces this to @xmath18 now if there is a mode with @xmath14 , the factor of @xmath12 is canceled by a @xmath15 piece in the trace of @xmath19 .",
    "configurations containing a zero mode give a constant contribution to the condensate that survives in the chiral limit .",
    "note that this effect is unrelated to spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and appears even with finite volume .",
    "this contribution to the condensate is special to the one - flavor theory . because of the anomaly",
    ", this quark condensate is not an order parameter for any symmetry . with more fermion species",
    "there will be additional factors of @xmath12 from the determinant .",
    "then the effect is of higher order in the fermion fields and does not appear directly in the condensate . for two or more flavors the standard banks - casher picture @xcite of an eigenvalue accumulation leading to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry should apply .",
    "the conventional discussion of the t hooft vertex starts by inserting fermionic sources into the path integral @xmath20 differentiation , in the grasmannian sense , with respect to these sources can generate the expectation for an arbitrary product of fermionic operators .",
    "integrating out the fermions reduces this to @xmath21 consider a zero mode @xmath22 satisfying @xmath23 . if the source has an overlap with the mode , that is @xmath24 , then a factor of @xmath15 in the source term can cancel the @xmath12 from the determinant .",
    "although non - trivial topological configurations do not contribute to @xmath25 , their effects can survive in correlation functions .",
    "for the one - flavor theory the effective interaction is bilinear in the fermion sources and is proportional to @xmath26 as discussed later , the index theorem tells us that in general the zero mode is chiral ; it appears in either @xmath27 or @xmath28 , depending on the sign of the gauge field winding .    with @xmath29 flavors ,",
    "the cancellation of the mass factors in the determinant requires source factors from each flavor .",
    "this combination is the t hooft vertex .",
    "it is an effective @xmath30 fermion operator . in the process",
    ", every flavor flips its spin , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ instanton ] .",
    "indeed , this is the chiral anomaly ; left and right helicities are not separately conserved .",
    "because of pauli statistics , the multi - flavor vertex can be written in the form of a determinant .",
    "this clarifies how the vertex preserves flavored chiral symmetries . with two flavors ,",
    "call them @xmath31 and @xmath32 , eq .",
    "[ bilinear ] generalizes to @xmath33    note that the effect of the vertex is non - local . in general the zero mode @xmath22 is spread out over some finite region .",
    "this means there is an inherent position space uncertainty on where the fermions are interacting .",
    "a particular consequence is that fermion conservation is only a global symmetry . in minkowski space language ,",
    "this non - locality can be thought of in terms of states sliding in and out of the dirac sea at different locations .",
    "the best known consequence of the t hooft interaction is the explanation of why the @xmath0 meson is substantially heavier than the other pseudo - scalars .",
    "consider the three - flavor theory with up , down , and strange quarks , @xmath34 .",
    "the quark model indicates that this theory should have three neutral non - strange pseudo - scalars .",
    "experimentally these are the @xmath35 at 135 mev , the @xmath36 at 548 mev , and the @xmath0 at 958 mev . in the quark model",
    ", these should be combinations of the quark bound states @xmath37 .    in the standard chiral picture ,",
    "the squares of the goldstone boson masses are linear in quark masses .",
    "the strange quark is the heaviest of the three , with its mass related to @xmath38 498 mev .",
    "the maximum mass a goldstone boson could have would be if it is pure @xmath39 . ignoring the light quark masses",
    ", this maximum value is @xmath40 , substantially less than the observed mass of the @xmath41 . from this",
    "we are driven to conclude that the @xmath0 must be something else and not a goldstone boson .    when viewed in the context of the t hooft interaction ,",
    "the problem disappears .",
    "the vertex directly breaks the naive @xmath42 axial symmetry , and thus there is no need for a corresponding goldstone boson .",
    "thus , the mass of the @xmath0 should be of order the strong interaction scale plus the masses of the contained quarks .",
    "indeed , when compared to a vector meson mass , such as the @xmath43 at 1019 mev , the 958 mev of the @xmath0 seems quite normal .    even though this resolves the issue , it is perhaps interesting to look a bit further into the differences between the singlet and the flavored pseudo - scalar mesons . for the one - flavor case",
    "there are two effects that give extra contributions to the singlet mass .",
    "first , the vertex itself gives a direct mass shift to the quark , and , second , the vertex directly couples the quark - antiquark content to gluonic intermediate states .",
    "in general it is expected that @xmath44 the @xmath0 can be created not just by quark operators but also a pseudo - scalar gluonic combination .    with more quark species ,",
    "flavored pseudo - scalar goldstone bosons should exist .",
    "their primary difference from the singlet is the absence of the gluonic intermediate states .",
    "it is the t hooft vertex that non - locally couples @xmath45 to the quark - antiquark content of the flavor singlet meson .",
    "note that with multiple flavors the vertex involves more than two fermion lines ; the contributions of the extra lines can be absorbed in the condensate , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ etamassfig ] .",
    "this large mass generation is sometimes referred to as coming from `` constituent '' quark masses , as opposed to the `` current '' quark masses that vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "the renormalization group provides useful information on the coupling constant dependence of the @xmath0 mass as the cutoff is removed .",
    "these equations read @xmath46 for the bare coupling constant @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the bare quark mass @xmath12 .",
    "i include this latter equation for later discussion .",
    "as is well known , the coefficients @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are independent of renormalization scheme .",
    "it is important to remember that the separation of the perturbative and non - perturbative parts of the renormalization group equations is scheme dependent .",
    "indeed , different definitions of the coupling constant will in general differ by non - perturbative parts",
    ". this will play an important role later when i discuss non - perturbative changes in the definition of quark masses .",
    "renormalizing by holding the @xmath0 mass fixed allows the solution of the the coupling constant equation with the result @xmath52 here @xmath53 is a dynamically determined constant which could in principle be determined in numerical simulations . because the inverse of the coupling appears in the exponent",
    ", this dependence is non - perturbative . indeed",
    ", this equation is a simple restatement of asymptotic freedom , the requirement that @xmath54 logarithmically .",
    "the importance of this relation is that similar expressions involving exponential dependences on the inverse coupling are natural and expected to occur in any quantities where non - perturbative effects are important .",
    "the reason these zero modes remain crucial is their robustness through the connection to the index theorem @xcite .",
    "otherwise they could be argued to contribute a set of measure zero to the path integral . when the gauge field is smooth , then the difference in the number of right handed and left handed zero modes is tied to a topological wrapping of the gauge fields at infinity around the gauge group .",
    "being topological , this winding is robust under small deformations of the gauge fields . therefore exact zero modes are not accidental but required whenever gauge configurations have non - trivial topology",
    ".    the robustness of these zero modes can also be seen directly from the eigenvalue structure of the dirac operator .",
    "this builds on @xmath55 hermiticity @xmath56 a condition true in the naive continuum theory as well as most lattice discretizations .",
    "a direct consequence is that non - real eigenvalues of @xmath11 occur in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "all eigenvalues @xmath57 satisfy @xmath58 , where the vertical lines denote the determinant .",
    "this plus the fact that @xmath59 gives latexmath:[\\[|d-\\lambda^*|=|\\gamma_5 ( d^\\dagger-\\lambda^*)\\gamma_5|=    either in complex pairs or real .",
    "close to the massless continuum limit , @xmath11 is predominantly anti - hermitian .",
    "small real eigenvalues correspond to the zero modes that generate the t hooft vertex . ignoring possible lattice artifacts",
    ", @xmath11 should approximately anticommute with @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath61 , then @xmath62 thus @xmath11 and @xmath55 commute on the subspace spanned by all the zero modes . restricted to this space , these matrices can be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "since all eigenvalues of @xmath55 are plus or minus unity , the trace of @xmath55 restricted to this subspace must be an integer .",
    "because of this quantization , this integer will generically be robust under small variations of the gauge fields .",
    "this defines the index for the given gauge field .",
    "this approach of defining the index directly through the eigenvalues of the dirac operator has the advantage over the topological definition in that the gauge fields need not be differentiable . for smooth fields the definitions are equivalent through the index theorem .",
    "but in general path integrals are dominated by non - differentiable fields .",
    "also , on the lattice the gauge fields lose the precise notion of continuity and topology .    in the fermion approach to the index other subtleties",
    "in general a regularization can introduce distortions so that the real eigenvalues are not necessarily exactly at the same place .",
    "in particular , for wilson lattice fermions the real eigenvalues spread over a finite range .",
    "in addition to the small eigenvalues near zero , the wilson approach has additional real eigenvalues far from the origin that are associated with doublers .",
    "applying @xmath55 to a small eigenvector will in general mix in a small about of the larger modes .",
    "this allows the trace of @xmath55 on the subspace involving only the low modes to deviate from an exact integer .",
    "the overlap operator @xcite does constrain the small real eigenvalues to be at the origin and the earlier argument goes through . in this case",
    "additional real eigenvalues do occur far from the origin .",
    "these are required so that the trace of @xmath55 over the full space will vanish .",
    "since the overlap operator keeps the index discrete , it is forced to exhibit discontinuous behavior as the gauge fields vary between topological sectors . in the vicinity of these discontinuities the gauge fields can be thought of as `` rough '' and the precise value of the index can depend on the details of the kernel used to project onto the overlap matrix . for multiple light fermion flavors this ambiguity in the index",
    "is expected to be suppressed in the continuum limit .",
    "nevertheless , the issues discussed later for a single massless quark suggests that the situation may be more subtle for the zero or one species case .",
    "when the quarks are massless , the classical field theory corresponding to the strong interactions has a @xmath42 axial symmetry under the transformation @xmath63 it is the t hooft vertex that explains how this symmetry does not survive quantization . in this section",
    "i discuss how in some special cases , in particular when the quarks are in non - fundamental representations of the gauge group , discrete subgroups of this symmetry can remain .",
    "while these considerations do not apply to the usual theory of the strong interactions , there are several reasons to study them anyway . at higher energies ,",
    "perhaps as will be probed at the upcoming large hadron collider , one might well discover new strong interactions that play a substantial role in the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak theory . also , many grand unified theories involve fermions in non - fundamental representations . as one example ,",
    "massless fermions in the 10 representation of @xmath64 possess a @xmath65 discrete chiral symmetry .",
    "similarly the left handed 16 covering representation of @xmath66 gives a chiral gauge theory with a surviving discrete @xmath67 chiral symmetry . understanding these symmetries",
    "may play some role in an eventual discretization of chiral gauge theories on the lattice .",
    "i build here on generalizations of the index theorem relating gauge field topology to zero modes of the dirac operator .",
    "in particular , fermions in higher representations can involve in multiple zero modes for a given winding .",
    "being generic , consider representation @xmath68 of a gauge group @xmath69 .",
    "denote by @xmath70 the number of zero modes that are required per unit of winding number in the gauge fields .",
    "that is , suppose the index theorem generalizes to @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the number of right and left handed zero modes , respectively , and @xmath74 is the winding number of the associated gauge field .",
    "the basic t hooft vertex receives contributions from each zero mode , resulting in an effective operator which is a product of @xmath75 fermion fields .",
    "schematically , the vertex is modified along the lines @xmath76 . while this form still breaks the @xmath42 axial symmetry , it is invariant under @xmath77 . in other words",
    ", there is a @xmath78 discrete axial symmetry .",
    "there are a variety of convenient tools for determining @xmath70 .",
    "consider building up representations from lower ones .",
    "take two representations @xmath79 and @xmath80 and form the direct product representation @xmath81 .",
    "let the matrix dimensions for @xmath79 and @xmath80 be @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "then for the product representation we have @xmath84 to see this , start with @xmath79 and @xmath80 representing two independent groups @xmath85 and @xmath86 . with @xmath85 having winding , there will be a zero mode for each of the dimensions of the matrix index associated with @xmath80 .",
    "similarly there will be multiple modes for winding in @xmath86 .",
    "these modes are robust and all should remain if we now constrain the groups to be the same .    as a first example , denote the fundamental representation of @xmath87 as @xmath88 and the adjoint representation as @xmath3 . then using @xmath89 in the above gives @xmath90 , as noted some time ago in ref .",
    "@xcite . with @xmath91 ,",
    "fermions in the adjoint representation will have six - fold degenerate zero modes .",
    "for another example , consider @xmath92 and build up towards arbitrary spin @xmath93 . recursing the above relation",
    "gives the result for arbitrary spin @xmath94    another technique for finding @xmath70 in more complicated groups begins by rotating all topological structure into an @xmath92 subgroup and then counting the corresponding @xmath92 representations making up the larger representation of the whole group .",
    "an example to illustrate this procedure is the antisymmetric two indexed representation of @xmath87 .",
    "this representation has been extensively used in @xcite for an alternative approach to the large @xmath95 limit .",
    "the basic @xmath96 fermion fields take the form @xmath97 consider rotating all topology into the @xmath92 subgroup involving the first two indices , i.e. 1 and 2 . because of the anti - symmetrization , the field @xmath98 is a singlet in this subgroup .",
    "the field pairs @xmath99 form a doublet for each @xmath100 .",
    "finally , the @xmath101 remaining fields do not transform under this subgroup and are singlets .",
    "overall we have @xmath102 doublets under the @xmath92 subgroup , each of which gives one zero mode per winding number .",
    "we conclude that the t hooft vertex leaves behind a @xmath103 discrete chiral symmetry . specializing to the 10 representation of @xmath64 ,",
    "this is the @xmath65 mentioned earlier .",
    "another example is the group @xmath66 with fermions in the 16 dimensional covering group .",
    "this forms the basis of a rather interesting grand unified theory , where one generation of fermions is placed into a single left handed 16 multiplet @xcite .",
    "this representation includes two quark species interacting with the @xmath91 subgroup of the strong interactions , rotating a topological excitation into this subgroup , we see that the effective vertex will be a four fermion operator and preserve a @xmath67 discrete chiral symmetry .",
    "it is unclear whether these discrete symmetries are expected to be spontaneously broken .",
    "since they are discrete , such breaking is not associated with goldstone bosons .",
    "but the quark condensate does provide an order parameter ; so when @xmath104 , any such breaking would be conceptually meaningful . returning to the @xmath64 case with fermions in the 10 ,",
    "a spontaneous breaking would give rise to discrete jumps in this order parameter as a function of the complex mass plane , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ sufivealt ] . alternatively",
    ", the unbroken theory would have a phase diagram more like that in fig .",
    "[ sufive ] . in these figures",
    "i assume that for large mass a spontaneous breaking of parity does occur when the strong cp violation angle is set to @xmath105 .",
    "such a jump is expected even for the one - flavor theory with fermions in the fundamental representation @xcite .    which of these behaviors is correct",
    "could be determined in lattice simulations , although there are issues in how the lattice formulation is set up .",
    "the wilson approach involves irrelevant chiral symmetry breaking operators that will in general distort the three fold symmetry of these models .",
    "even the overlap operator @xcite , which respects a variation of the continuous chiral symmetries , appears to break these discrete symmetries @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as one comes sufficiently close to the continuum limit , it should be possible to distinguish between these scenarios .",
    "when the quarks are massless , the classical field theory corresponding to the strong interactions has a @xmath42 axial symmetry under the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ thetarot ] ) . on the other hand , a fermion mass term ,",
    "say @xmath106 , breaks this symmetry explicitly . indeed , under the chiral rotation of eq .",
    "( [ thetarot ] ) @xmath107 if the classical chiral symmetry of the kinetic term was not broken by quantum effects , then a mass term of the form of the right hand side of this equation would be physically completely equivalent to the normal mass term .",
    "but because of the effect of the t hooft interaction , the theory with the rotated mass is physically inequivalent to the unrotated theory .",
    "however the theory is regulated , it is essential that the cutoff distinguish between the two terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ m5 ] ) . with a pauli - villars scheme",
    "it is the the mass for the heavy regulator field that fixes the angle @xmath108 . for wilson fermions",
    "the wilson term selects the chiral direction .",
    "this carries over to the overlap formulation , built on a projection from the wilson operator .",
    "unfortunately it is the absence of such a distinction that lies at the heart of the failure of the rooting prescription for staggered fermions , as discussed later .",
    "the above rotation is often described by complexifying the mass term .",
    "if we write @xmath109 with @xmath110 then our generalized mass term takes the form @xmath111 with @xmath112 a complex number . in this latter notation , the effect of the t hooft vertex is to make the phase of the mass matrix an observable quantity",
    "this phase is connected to the strong @xmath113 angle , usually called @xmath114 .    indeed , because of this effect , the real and the imaginary parts of the quark masses are actually independent parameters .",
    "the two terms @xmath115 and @xmath116 , which are naively equivalent , are in fact distinct possible ways to break the chiral symmetry .",
    "it is the t hooft vertex which distinguishes one of them a special . with usual conventions",
    "@xmath116 is a cp odd operator ; therefore , its interference with the vertex can generate explicit cp violation .",
    "the non - observation of such in the strong interactions indicates this term must be quite small ; this lies at the heart of the strong cp problem .    with multiple flavors",
    "the possibility of flavored axial chiral rotations allows one to move the phase of the mass between the various species without changing the physical consequences .",
    "one natural choice is to place all phases on the lightest quark , say the up quark , and keep all others real .",
    "equivalently one could put all the phase on the top quark , but this would obscure the effects on low energy physics .",
    "if one gives all quarks a common phase @xmath108 , then that phase is is related to the physical parameter by @xmath117 .",
    "one of the puzzles of the strong interactions is the experimental absence of cp violation , which would not be the case if the imaginary part of the mass were present",
    ". this would be quite unnatural if at some higher energy the strong interactions were unified with the weak interactions , which are well known not to satisfy cp symmetry .",
    "on considering the strong interactions at lower energies , some residual effect of this breaking would naturally appear in the basic parameters , in particular through the imaginary part of the quark mass .",
    "the apparent experimental absence of such is known as the strong cp puzzle .",
    "an old suggestion to resolve this puzzle is that one of the quark masses might vanish .",
    "indeed , this is a bit of a tautology since if it vanishes as a complex parameter , so does its imaginary part .",
    "but the imaginary part is really an independent parameter , and so it seems quite peculiar to tie it to the real part . while phenomenological models suggest that the up quark mass is in fact far from vanishing , various attempts to go beyond the standard model continue to attempt building in a vanishing up - quark mass at some high scale as an escape from the strong cp problem @xcite .",
    "it is through consideration of the t hooft vertex that one sees that this solution is in fact ill posed @xcite . as discussed earlier , for the one - flavor case the vertex introduces a shift in the quark mass of order @xmath119 .",
    "the amount of this shift will in general depend on the details of the renormalization group scheme and the scale of definition .",
    "the concept of a vanishing mass is not a renormalization group invariant , and as such it should not be relevant to a fundamental issue such as whether the strong interactions violate cp symmetry .",
    "this point carries over into the theory with multiple flavors as long as they are not degenerate . the experimental fact",
    "that the pion mass does not vanish indicates that two independent flavors can not both be massless .",
    "if one considers the multiple flavor t hooft vertex , then one can always absorb the involved heavy quark lines with their masses , as sketched in fig .  [ thooft ] .",
    "this leaves behind a residual bilinear fermion vertex of order the product of the heavier quark masses .",
    "for the three flavor theory , this gives an ambiguity in the definition of the up quark mass of order @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "note that it is the mass associated with chiral symmetry , i.e. the `` current '' quark mass , that is being considered here ; thus , the heavy quark lines can not be absorbed in the condensate as they were in the earlier discussion of the @xmath0 mass .",
    "can we define a massless quark via its bare value ?",
    "this approach fails at the outset due to the perturbative divergences inherent in the bare parameters of any quantum field theory .",
    "indeed , the renormalization group tells us that the bare quark mass must be zero , regardless of the physical hadronic spectrum .",
    "one immediate consequence is that it does not make sense to take the continuum limit before taking the mass to zero ; the two limits are intricately entwined through the renormalization group equations .    to see this explicitly , recall the renormalization group equation for the mass , eq .",
    "( [ mrg ] ) .",
    "this is easily solved to reveal the small cutoff behavior of the bare mass @xmath121 this goes to zero as @xmath122 since @xmath47 does so by asymptotic freedom and @xmath123 . here",
    "@xmath124 denotes an integration constant which might be regarded as a `` renormalized mass . ''",
    "one can not sensibly use @xmath124 to define a vanishing mass since it has an additive ambiguity .",
    "for example , consider a non - perturbative redefinition of the bare mass @xmath125 this is still a solution of the renormalization group equation , but involves the shift @xmath126 since the parameter @xmath127 can be chosen arbitrarily , a vanishing of the renormalized mass for a non - degenerate quark is meaningless . while the exponential factor in eq .",
    "( [ tildem ] ) may look contrived , non - perturbative forms like this are in fact natural .",
    "indeed , compare this expression with that for the eta prime mass , eq .",
    "( [ mofa ] ) .",
    "in 1986 kaplan and manohar @xcite , working in the context of next to leading order chiral lagrangians , pointed out an inherent ambiguity in the quark masses .",
    "this takes a similar form to that found above , being proportional to the product of the heavier quark masses .",
    "the appearance of this form from the t hooft vertex is illustrative of a fundamental connection to the phenomenological chiral lagrangian models .    in this section",
    "i slightly rephrase the kaplan - manohar argument .",
    "consider the three flavor theory with mass matrix @xmath128 chiral symmetry manifests itself in the massive theory as an invariance of physical quantities under changes in the quark mass matrix . under a rotation of the form",
    "@xmath129 the basic physics of particles and their scatterings will remain equivalent . here",
    "@xmath130 and @xmath131 are arbitrary elements of the flavor group , here taken as @xmath91 .    to proceed , consider the invariance of the antisymmetric tensor under the flavor group @xmath132 using this , it is straightforward to show that the combination @xmath133 transforms exactly the same way as @xmath134 under the change in eq .",
    "( [ chiralm ] ) .",
    "this symmetry allows the renormalization group equations to mix the term in eq .",
    "( [ chiralm1 ] ) with the starting mass matrix . under a change of scale",
    ", the mass matrix can evolve to a combination along the lines @xmath135 writing this in terms of the three quark masses in eq .",
    "( [ massmatrix ] ) gives @xmath136 this is exactly the same form as generated by the t hooft vertex .",
    "for the three flavor theory this is a next - to - leading - order chiral ambiguity in @xmath137 . dropping down to less flavors",
    "the issue becomes sharper , being a leading - order mixing of @xmath137 with @xmath138 in the two flavor case .",
    "for one flavor it is a zeroth - order effect , leaving a mass ambiguity of order @xmath119 .",
    "increasing the number of light flavors tends to suppress topologically non - trivial gauge configurations .",
    "effectively the fermions act to smooth out rough gauge fields .",
    "if we drop down in the number of flavors even further towards the pure yang - mills theory , the fluctuations associated with topology should become still stronger .",
    "indeed , the issues present in the one - flavor case suggest that there may be a residual ambiguity in defining topological susceptibility for the pure glue theory @xcite .    since the theta parameter arises from topological issues in the gauge theory , one might wonder how its effects can be present in the chiral lagrangian approach , where the gauge fields are effectively hidden .",
    "the reason is tied to the constraint that the effective fields are in the group @xmath91 rather than @xmath139 .",
    "the chiral lagrangian imposes from the outset the correct symmetry of the theory including anomalies .",
    "had one worked with a @xmath139 effective field , then one would need to add a term to break the unwanted axial @xmath42 . involving the determinant of the effective matrix accomplishes this , as in ref .",
    "another approach to the strong cp issue is to make the imaginary part of the quark mass a dynamical quantity that naturally relaxes to zero .",
    "excitations of this new dynamical field are referred to as axions , and this is known as the axion solution to the strong cp problem . the basic idea is to replace a quark mass term with a coupling to a new dynamical field @xmath140 @xmath141 here @xmath142 is a parameter that allows one to adjust the strength of the axion coupling to hadrons ; if @xmath142 is sufficiently small , the axion would not be observable in ordinary hadronic interactions .",
    "any imaginary part in @xmath12 can then be shifted away , thus removing cp violation .",
    "this is the peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite .    at this level",
    "the axion is massless .",
    "however , the operator coupled to the axion field can create eta prime mesons , so this term will mix the axion and the eta prime . since non -",
    "perturbative effects give the eta prime a large mass , this mixing will in general not leave the physical axion massless ; indeed it should acquire a mass of order @xmath143 .    this requirement for a renormalization of the axion mass",
    "shows how the anomaly forces a breaking of the peccei - quinn symmetry . as that was motivated by the strong cp problem",
    ", one might wonder if the axion really still solves this issue . as long as cp violation is present in some unified theory , and we do nt have the shift symmetry , the reduction to the strong interactions could leave behind a linear term in the axion field , i.e. something that can not be shifted away .",
    "the fact that we are taking @xmath142 small suggests that such a term would naturally be of order @xmath143 , i.e. something of order the axion mixing with the eta prime .",
    "as long as the axion mass is not large , the visible cp violations in the strong interactions will remain small and the axion solution to the strong cp problem remains viable .",
    "among the more controversial consequences of the t hooft vertex is the fact that it is severely mutilated by the `` rooting trick '' popular in many lattice gauge simulations @xcite .",
    "this represents a serious flaw in these algorithms .",
    "indeed , the main purpose of lattice gauge theory is to obtain non - perturbative information on field theories , and the t hooft interaction is one of the most important non - perturbative effects .",
    "nevertheless , the large investments that have been made in such algorithms has led some authors to attempt refuting this flaw @xcite .",
    "the problem arises because the staggered formulation for lattice quarks starts with an inherent factor of four in the number of species @xcite .",
    "these species are sometimes called `` tastes . ''",
    "associated with this degeneracy is one exact chiral symmetry , which corresponds to a flavored chiral symmetry amongst the tastes .",
    "as one approaches the continuum limit , the t hooft vertex continues to couple to all tastes .",
    "all of these states will be involved as intermediate states in the interactions between topological objects .",
    "they give a contribution which is constant as the mass goes to zero , with a factor of @xmath144 from the determinant being canceled by a factor of @xmath145 from the sources .",
    "the rooting `` trick '' is an attempt to reduce the theory from one with four tastes per flavor to only one .",
    "this is done by replacing the fermion determinant with its fourth root .",
    "however , this process preserves any symmetries of the determinant , including the one exact chiral symmetry of the staggered formulation .",
    "this is a foreboding of inherent problems since the one - flavor theory is not allowed to have any chiral symmetry .",
    "this symmetry forbids the appearance of the mass shift that is associated with the t hooft vertex of the one flavor theory .",
    "the main issue with rooting is that , even after the process , four potential tastes remain in the sources .",
    "the effective vertex will couple to all of them and be a multi - linear operator of the same order as it was in the unrooted theory .",
    "furthermore , it will have a severe singularity in the massless limit since the rooting reduces the @xmath144 factor from the determinant to simply @xmath12 , while the @xmath145 from the sources remains .",
    "for the one - flavor theory the issue is particularly extreme . in this case",
    "the bilinear t hooft vertex should be a mass shift .",
    "however such an effect is forbidden by the exact chiral symmetry of the rooted formulation .    another way to see",
    "the issue with staggered fermions is via the chiral rotation in eq .",
    "( [ m5 ] ) . as discussed there , it is essential that two types of inequivalent mass terms be present . for staggered fermions",
    "the role of @xmath55 is played by the parity of the site , i.e. @xmath146 depending on whether one is on an even or odd lattice site . unfortunately , the exact chiral symmetry of the staggered formulation gives physics which is completely independent of the angle @xmath108 . for the unrooted theory",
    "this is acceptable since it is actually a flavored chiral rotation amongst the tastes , with two rotating one way and two with the opposite effective sign for @xmath108 .",
    "but on rooting this symmetry is preserved , and thus the regulator can not be complete .",
    "i have discussed a variety of consequences of the t hooft operator .",
    "this is a rather old topic , but many of these consequences remain poorly understood .",
    "the approach remains the primary route towards understanding the quantum mechanical loss of the classical axial @xmath42 symmetry and the connection of this with the @xmath0 mass .",
    "the vertex is a direct consequence of the robust nature of exact zero modes of the dirac operator .",
    "these modes are tied to the topology of the gauge fields through the index theorem .",
    "their stability under small perturbations of the gauge fields follows from their chiral nature .",
    "the form of the vertex exposes interesting discrete symmetries in some potential models for unification .",
    "understanding these properties may be helpful towards finding a non - perturbative regulator for gauge theories involving chiral couplings to fermions .",
    "this effective interaction ties together and gives a qualitative understanding of several controversial ideas . in particular , the flaws in the rooting trick used in lattice gauge theory become clear in this context , although they are only beginning to be appreciated .",
    "also , various attempts to formulate theories beyond the standard model continue to speculate on a vanishing up quark mass , despite this being an ill - posed concept .",
