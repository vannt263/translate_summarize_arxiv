    "we stress that these / ratios are not calculated from simultaneous measurements of and , but from a simple ranking of the observed values of each .",
    "nevertheless , a striking change in non - flaring emission appears to take place between the m7 star vb  8 , in which @xmath108 and the m8 and m9 dwarfs vb  10 and lp  944 - 20 , in which @xmath109 ( noted by fleming et  al .  2003 ) .",
    "this suggests that the efficiency of persistent coronal heating decays more quickly in response to the increasingly neutral atmosphere of ultracool dwarfs than the efficiency of chromospheric heating . within the same sample , excluding lp  944 - 20 , transition region heating , inferred from c iv emission , appears to remain as efficient as chromospheric heating ( hawley & johns - krull 2003 ) .",
    "the ratio of the single measurements of and from roque  14 is 4.0 .",
    "if roque  14 s measured chromospheric and coronal emissions are interpreted as persistent this suggests that its magnetic activity is of similar character to that of vb  8 and active main - sequence m dwarfs .",
    "although we can not exclude that roque  14 s observed x - ray emission is solely the result of a flare with decay time - scale @xmath71 ks , like the observed high - level x - ray emission from m8 old - disc star vb  10 and m9 dwarfs lp  944 - 20 , lhs  2065 and rxs  j115928.5 - 524717 , the high h@xmath6 emission level of roque  14 supports a persistently higher level of magnetic activity than on these cooler dwarfs .",
    "roque  14 has been suspected to be a near - equal - mass binary , but /@xmath110 even if the x - ray emission is interpreted as coming from two stars , as a ratio with the continuum , it should be little changed whether there is one source or are two similar sources . ] .",
    "an observation by the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "nicmos camera does not support roque  14 s binarity , finding no companion of comparable brightness at separations @xmath48 arcsec , or 13.5 au ( martn et  al .",
    "while interaction between two close binary components could be influential in the x - ray production mechanism , the emission is at a similar level to that produced by magnetic activity on single active ms m dwarfs .",
    "the observed strong h@xmath6 emission from the m7.5 roque  12 hints at activity similar to that of roque  14 . in contrast , the measured h@xmath6 emission levels of the m8 pleiades brown dwarfs teide  1 and roque  11 are very like that of the m8 vb  10 , and we speculate that the magnetic activity of these objects is already in the regime where @xmath109 and their persistent x - ray emission levels are more than an order of magnitude lower than that of roque  14 .",
    "deeper x - ray observations are required to test this prediction .",
    "very young brown dwarfs in star - forming regions are now routinely observed to emit x - rays at levels of @xmath4@xmath111@xmath112 that arise from hot ( @xmath113 k ) plasma ( e.g. imanishi et  al .",
    "2001 ; preibisch & zinnecker 2002 ; feigelson et  al .  2002 ) .",
    "a growing body of evidence indicates that young brown dwarfs experience accretion and outflows just like young low - mass stars ( jayawardhana , mohanty & basri 2003 ) .",
    "their x - ray emission is very likely to be produced by similar means to t  tauri stars .",
    "this is probably largely coronal emission as a result of magnetic activity , as in older low - mass stars , and as young substellar objects may have photospheres as warm as 2900 k ( e.g. baraffe et  al .",
    "1998 ) , their atmospheric conditions are ripe for the efficient coronal heating seen on active ms m56 stars .",
    "however , h@xmath6 emission may arise predominantly from material accreting on to the young brown dwarf , rather than from a hot chromosphere .",
    "x - ray emission levels appear to rise with h@xmath6 emission levels up to @xmath114  , as would be expected for h@xmath6 emission predominantly from a magnetically - powered chromosphere , but there is no detection of x - rays from a young brown dwarf with @xmath115  ( tsuboi et  al .  2003 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario emerging from x - ray surveys of t  tauri stars wherein samples of stars showing signs of strong accretion , such as high @xmath116 , appear to show lower levels of x - ray emission than weakly - accreting objects of similar mass ( e.g. flaccomio , micela & sciortino 2003 ) .",
    "x - ray emission has been previously detected from just two brown dwarfs older than 5 myr .",
    "while any accretion is expected to have ceased by the age of the 12 myr - old twa  5b , this object has a much lower mass than roque  14 , 0.0140.043 m@xmath117 ( neuhuser et  al .",
    "2000 ) , and is unlikely to be a good model for its youthful x - ray activity .",
    "conversely , lp  944 - 20 appears to have a similar mass to roque  14 , 0.0560.064 m@xmath117 ( tinney 1998 ) .",
    "it has cooled to a spectral type of m9 , so its lower atmosphere is highly neutral , which is probably the key reason why its persistent x - ray emission level is @xmath36 times lower than those of many very young brown dwarfs and the detected level from roque  14 .",
    "however , we should be wary of assuming that the activity levels of all coeval brown dwarfs are the same , and that roque  14 and lp  944 - 20 are representative of their respective ages .",
    "there is a large spread in the observed / values of young brown dwarfs , a significant number being undetected at upper limits @xmath118 ( e.g. imanishi et  al .",
    "roque  14 has one of the highest h@xmath6 emission levels among pleiades brown dwarf candidates ( zapatero osorio et  al .",
    "1997b ) , while lp  944 - 20 has one of the lowest among m9 field dwarfs ( mohanty & basri 2003 ) .",
    "so , while we may expect the x - ray emission level of brown dwarfs to decrease as they age from @xmath119 to @xmath1 myr , as apparently observed by comparing roque  14 and lp  944 - 20 , the effect is probably exaggerated in choosing these two objects as representative .",
    "larger , and necessarily deeper , surveys of the x - ray emission of brown dwarfs in the field and in the pleiades ( and other clusters ) are required to make further progress in understanding the evolution of the magnetic activity of substellar and ultracool objects .",
    "we have observed five candidate brown dwarfs in the pleiades with _ xmm - newton _ , detecting x - ray emission from the m7 roque  14 .",
    "the low number of counts and significant contribution of background counts prevent meaningful constraint of the temperature and exclusion of transient emission . assuming a plasma temperature of @xmath82 k and nominal absorbing column to the pleiades of @xmath120 @xmath79 , the time - averaged x - ray luminosity of @xmath121 , and its ratios with the bolometric ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) and h@xmath6 ( / @xmath7 ) luminosities resemble those of active main - sequence m dwarfs , as have been observed on the m7 old - disc star vb  8 .",
    "we have placed the tightest upper limits thus far on the x - ray emission levels of the four later - type pleiades brown dwarfs : @xmath122@xmath123 , and @xmath4 @xmath124@xmath92 .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _",
    "data do not exclude that roque  14 s observed high level of x - ray emission is solely the result of a flare with decay time - scale @xmath71 ks like the observed high - level emission from m89 field dwarfs vb  10 , lp  944 - 20 , lhs  2065 and rxs  j115928.5 - 524717 , but the high h@xmath6 emission level of roque  14 is supportive of a persistently higher level of magnetic activity than on these cooler dwarfs .",
    "however , the similarity of the low h@xmath6 emission levels of teide  1 and roque  11 to that of the m8 old - disc star vb  10 prompts us to speculate that the persistent x - ray emission levels of m8 brown dwarfs in the pleiades may be low , with @xmath4@xmath125 , like those of vb  10 and the m9 , @xmath1 myr - old brown dwarf lp  944 - 20 .",
    "deeper x - ray observations , less contaminated by background , are required to confirm a persistent high level of x - ray emission from roque  14 , to assess its coronal temperature , and to probe the typical x - ray emission levels of pleiades brown dwarfs . coordinated programmes to study x - ray , h@xmath6 and radio emission from ultracool and brown dwarfs of a range of ages",
