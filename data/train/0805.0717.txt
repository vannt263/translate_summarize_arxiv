    "the inclusive production of quarkonia was studied intensively in the past both in elementary hadronic and nuclear reactions at sps , rhic and tevatron energies . for a review see e.g.@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the exclusive production of heavy @xmath5 vector quarkonium states ( e.g. @xmath6 ) in hadronic interactions was never measured , but attracted recently much attention from the theoretical side @xcite . due to the negative charge - parity of the vector meson , the purely hadronic pomeron ",
    "pomeron fusion mechanism of exclusive meson production is not available , and instead the production will proceed via photon  pomeron fusion . a possible purely hadronic mechanism would involve the elusive odderon exchange @xcite . currently there is no compelling evidence for the odderon , and here we restrict ourselves to the photon ",
    "exchange mechanism , which exists without doubt , and must furthermore dominate any hadronic exchange at very small momentum transfers . in our approach to the exclusive hadronic reaction , we follow closely the procedure outlined in our previous work on @xmath7 production @xcite .",
    "there is one crucial difference , though .",
    "while in the case of diffractive @xmath7 photoproduction there exist a large body of fairly detailed data , including e.g. transverse momentum distributions , the photoproduction data for exclusive @xmath2 s are rather sparse @xcite .",
    "hence , different from @xcite we can not avoid modelling the relevant @xmath0 subprocess .",
    "fortunately , due to the large mass of the @xmath2 s constituents , the cross section gets its main contribution from small ",
    "size @xmath8dipoles , and the production mechanism can be described in a pqcd framework ( for a recent review and references , see @xcite ) .",
    "the two main ingredients are the unintegrated gluon distribution of the proton , and the light ",
    "cone wave function of the vector meson .",
    "the unintegrated gluon distribution is sufficiently well constrained by the precise small@xmath9 data for the inclusive proton structure function , and we shall content ourselves here with a particular parametrisation which provides a good description of inclusive deep inelastic scattering data @xcite . as the relevant energy range of the @xmath10 subprocess at tevatron overlaps well with the hera energy range , any glue which fulfills the stringent constraints of the precise hera @xmath11data must do a similar job .",
    "alternative unintegrated gluon distributions are discussed for example in @xcite .",
    "the current experimental analyses at the tevatron @xcite call for an evaluation of differential distributions including the effects of absorptive corrections .",
    "the hera data cover the @xmath12 center of mass ( cm ) energy range @xmath13 gev .",
    "this energy range is in fact very much relevant to the exclusive production at tevatron energies for not too large rapidities of the meson , say @xmath14 .",
    "this will be different at the lhc , where a broad range of subsystem energies @xmath15 , up to several tev , is spanned for @xmath2 emitted in the forward directions .",
    "this will require a long - range extrapolation to a completely new unexplored region . in this paper ,",
    "however , we will concentrate on predictitions for tevatron energies . here",
    "our input amplitude is constrained by the hera data , to which description we now turn .",
    "we thus turn to the analysis of the photoproduction recation studied at hera . the photoproduction amplitude will then be the major building block for our prediction of exclusive @xmath2 production at the tevatron .",

    "the longitudinal momentum transfer is nonvanishing , and , as indicated above , a more precise treatment would require the use of skewed / off  diagonal gluon distributions .",
    "at the high energies relevant here it is admissible to account for skewedness by an appropriate rescaling of the diagonal gluon distribution @xcite . with the specific gluon distribution used by us , the prescription of @xcite can be emulated by taking the ordinary gluon distribution at @xcite @xmath45 the full amplitude , at finite momentum transfer , well within the diffraction cone , is finally written as @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the ( transverse ) momentum transfer squared , @xmath48 is the energy ",

    "notice that strictly speaking inclusion of the @xmath43correction is not really warranted given that we do not have the corresponding radiative corrections to the production amplitude .",
    "fortunately , due to the large scale @xmath93 , the ambiguity in the two ways of adjusting the wave function parameters leads to only a marginal difference in the total cross section over most of the relevant energy range . to be fair",
    ", it should be mentioned , that the situation with the next  to  leading order corrections to diffractive vector mesons is not a very comfortable one , see for example the instabilities reported in @xcite .",
    "but then , the systematic extension of @xmath1factorisation is yet lacking , so that at present we must be content with estimates of the theoretical uncertainties obtained by changing the principal parameters in the calculation .",
    "as can bee seen from the figure , different functional forms of the lcwf can lead to a quite substantial differences in the predicted cross section .",
    "finally , the absence of experimental data for @xmath94distributions leaves the slope parameter @xmath53 only badly constrained .",
    "the full , energy dependent slope can be decomposed into three contributions : one from the transition @xmath95 , a second one from the dynamics of the gluon ladder exchanged  which induces the main part of its energy dependence , and a third one from the elastic @xmath96 vertex . in comparison to @xmath7production",
    ", we may expect , that the slope in our case receives a smaller contribution from the @xmath95 transition , due to the smaller transverse sizes involved @xcite .",

    "the description of data , given the large error bars , is quite acceptable .",

    "ratio_2s1s ] we show the ratio of the cross section for the first radial excitation @xmath100 to the cross section for the ground state @xmath101 .",
    "the principal reason behind the suppression of the @xmath82 state is the well  known node effect ( see @xcite and references therein )  a cancellation of strength in the @xmath82 case due to the change of sign of the radial wave function .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising , that the numerical value of the @xmath3ratio is strongly sensitive to the shape of the radial light  cone wave function .",
    "here we assumed an equality of the slopes for @xmath101 and @xmath100 production .",
    "this appears to be justified , given the large spread of predictions from different wave functions .",

    ", both initial state hadrons can be the source of the photon .",
    "therefore , it is now necessary to take account of the interference between two amplitudes .",
    "the photon exchange parts of the amplitude , involve only very small , predominantly transverse momentum transfers .",
    "in fact , here we concentrate on the kinematic domain , where the outgoing protons lose only tiny fractions @xmath104 of their longitudinal momenta , in practice @xmath105 means @xmath106 . in terms of the transverse momenta of outgoing hadrons , @xmath107 , the relevant four  momentum transfers are @xmath108 , and @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the familiar mandelstam variables for the appropriate subsystems .",
    "photon virtualities @xmath111 are small ( what counts here is that @xmath112 ) , so that the contribution from longitudinal photons can be safely neglected .",
    "also , as mentioned above , we assume the @xmath22channel  helicity conservation in the @xmath113 transition .",
