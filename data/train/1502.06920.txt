    "<S> , we recap that within the class of complex oxides with 3@xmath3 electrons there are two types of mott insulating behavior parameterized in the zaanen - sawatzky - allen scheme by the relative magnitude of on - site coulomb repulsion energy _ _ u__@xmath8 between @xmath3-shell electrons versus charge - transfer energy @xmath9 between oxygen @xmath10-shell and the tm @xmath3 state @xcite ; based on this one can distinguish between mott - hubbard insulators ( mhi , _ _ </S>",

    "<S> to date the vast majority of experimental and theoretical work has been focused on charge doping at the interfaces between mhi and mhi @xcite , and mhi and normal metal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some of the most remarkable physical phenomena such as high-@xmath13 superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance , however , are observed in charge - transfer compounds characterized by the strong hybridization between oxygen 2@xmath10 and transition metal 3@xmath3 states , complex electronic configurations ( e.g. , mixing between @xmath14 and @xmath14@xmath6 states ) and small or even negative charge excitation gap @xmath9 @xcite . in these materials </S>",
    "<S> the role of the lower hubbard band ( lhb ) is replaced by the oxygen states which in turn implies a very asymmetric physical character for the doped holes ( mainly in oxygen levels ) and doped electrons ( mainly in transition metal _ d _ levels ) , e.g. , correlated metal lanio@xmath0 ( lno ) . with the original motivation to create a cuprate - like electronic and orbital structures @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> lno - based perovskite heterostructures have attracted continuous interest @xcite in spite of the intriguing bulk properties of charge - transfer materials . however , experimentally very little is known about the mott carrier redistribution and their electronic reconfigurations at the heterointerface between mhi and ctm @xcite .    towards this goal , </S>",

    "<S> the resulting 2lto/2lno heterostructure exhibits an exotic mott ground state . to quantify this phenomenon , we investigated the interfacial charge - transfer from ti to ni sites and the reconstruction of the electronic structure by resonant soft x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) at ti , ni l@xmath20- and o k - edges combined with x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) , electrical transport , and first - principles calculations . </S>",

    "<S> the electronic configuration of ctm lani@xmath19o@xmath0 is a mixture of low - spin 3@xmath22 and high - spin 3@xmath23@xmath6 states with the fermi energy passing though the strongly mixed ni - o valence states @xcite , whereas as an archetypal mhi ( @xmath18  0.2  ev gap ) bulk lati@xmath19o@xmath0 has only one electron ( 3@xmath24 ) occupying the lhb @xcite and its fermi energy level @xmath21 is much higher than that of lno ( @xmath18 2 ev difference ) @xcite , as schematically shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b . by aligning the interfacial bands with respect to the continuing oxygen @xmath10 states on either side of the interface @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the resulting ti 3@xmath3 band energy position becomes significantly higher than the fermi energy of the lno ; this in turn implies a one - way charge redistribution from the ti 3@xmath3 band of lto into the partially filled ni @xmath3 and o @xmath10 states of lno . </S>",
    "<S> recent density functional theory ( dft + @xmath25 ) calculations @xcite further tested this naive picture and suggested a full electron charge - transfer , i.e. , ti @xmath24 + ni @xmath26  @xmath27  ti @xmath28 + ni @xmath29 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c ) . on the other hand , since the experimental electronic configuration of lno is a mixture of ni @xmath22 and d@xmath30@xmath31 states , the charge - transfer may also result in the appearance of additional interfacial electronic states , i.e. , ti @xmath24 + ni @xmath29@xmath31  @xmath27  ti @xmath28 + ni @xmath29 and ti @xmath24 + ni @xmath29@xmath31  @xmath27  ti @xmath28 + ni @xmath32@xmath31 .    to investigate the experimental veracity of the theory , we measured the electronic structures of ti and ni to track the charge - transfer by element - specific xas in total fluorescence yield mode ( tfy with the bulk probing depth ) and by in - situ xps . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a , the features of the ti l@xmath20-edge in the 2lto/2lno sample show excellent agreement with the ti@xmath33 charge and are markedly different from the spectra of ti@xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this result provides a strong evidence for the occurrence of the charge - transfer ti @xmath34  @xmath27 ti @xmath28 and implies that almost all of the @xmath35 electrons from ti sites are transferred elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> the flow of the charge is further verified by the complimentary xas measurements at the ni l@xmath20-edge , which clearly shows a strong increase of the ni charge state , i.e. , ni @xmath26  @xmath27  ni @xmath36 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison to the bulk reference spectra of ni@xmath37 ( double peaks at @xmath18 870.2 ev and 871.2 ev ) and ni@xmath19 ( single main peak at @xmath18 871.6 ev ) attests that in the 2lto/2lno superlattice the ni final state is indeed a mixture of ni@xmath37/ni@xmath19 ( double peaks ) , which is also affirmed by the calculated xas lineshape dependence on the ni electronic configuration ( see supplementary fig .  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> to further corroborate these findings , the interfacial charge - transfer phenomenon was studied by measuring the core - level electronic structures of ti and ni with in - situ xps ( see supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) ; as determined by xps the resulting charge states of ni and ti in the 2lto/2lno sample are in excellent agreement with those obtained by xas at ti l@xmath20- and ni l@xmath20-edges . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> as revealed by the angle - dependent ( ex - situ ) xps ( see supplementary fig .  4 ) , the pronounced ni@xmath37 peak near the interface of metallic 2lto/8lno ( see supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 ) further confirmed the interfacial charge - transfer from ti to ni sites .            </S>",
    "<S> * electronic reconstruction . * with the confirmed large interfacial charge - transfer from ti to ni sites , an important question arises : how does the interfacial charge - transfer alter the fundamental physical properties ( i.e. , electronic configuration and band structure ) of the 2lto/2lno sl ? </S>",
    "<S> first , we discussed the emergent electronic configuration . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , the channels of interfacial charge - transfer ti @xmath24 + ni @xmath26  @xmath27  ti @xmath28 + ni @xmath29 and ti @xmath24 + ni @xmath29@xmath31  @xmath27  ti @xmath28 + ni @xmath29 are both open at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , due to the strong hybridization between ni 3@xmath3-states and oxygen 2@xmath10-states at the fermi level , xas at o @xmath38-edge becomes another important way to probe the charge states of ni and ti mixed with ligand holes . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a and supplementary fig .  6 , in 2lto/2lno the oxygen </S>",
    "<S> k - edge spectra clearly show a characteristic low energy pre - peak at @xmath18 528.5 ev , which arises from the ligand holes @xcite . in sharp contrast </S>",
    "<S> , a direct comparison to the lto and lno reference samples immediately shows that the pre - peak at the 2lto/2lno interface is strongly suppressed due to the filling oxygen ligand holes with the transferred electrons from ti sites ( also see supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 6 ) . based on the absence of the pre - peak feature in the lati@xmath19o@xmath0 and ni@xmath37o reference samples , </S>",
    "<S> these data imply that the strong suppression of the pre - peak intensity results from the filling of holes on oxygen by the interfacial charge - transfer into the ni _ d_-band . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , this process induces the formation of the @xmath29 state and the strong suppression of the @xmath23@xmath31 configuration . also , we point out at the expected difference between the theory ( full charge - transfer of one electron ) @xcite and the experimental observation of less than one electron transfer , i.e. , ( 1 - 2@xmath17 ) electron ; the observed deviation from the full charge - transfer in theory is due to the reduced electron filling from unity , 2@xmath17 of the ti @xmath3-band . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the mixed @xmath22 and @xmath39 ground state of bulk lno this factor results in the observed peculiar electronic configuration of @xmath23 , @xmath22 , and @xmath39 states that appears at the interfacial nio@xmath40 layer in 2lto/2lno .        </S>",
    "<S> next , we discuss the reconstructed band structure at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> because of the observed strong reconstruction of electronic configuration , it is natural to anticipate a similarly strong modification of the band structure near the interface . as predicted by the theory @xcite and illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c , two opening gaps @xmath41 and @xmath42 are expected to appear at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> first we estimated a magnitude of the charge gap @xmath41 by measuring the temperature - dependent electrical transport properties of the 2lto/2lno and lno reference films . as immediately seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b , the lno thin film grown at the same conditions as the sl shows a metallic bulk - like behavior ( @xmath18  280 @xmath43 per square at 2 k ) from room temperature down to 2  k. in sharp contrast , the sl 2lto/2lno displays a highly insulating behavior with a very large sheet resistance increasing from @xmath18  175 k@xmath43 per square at 300  k to @xmath18 1 m@xmath43 per square at 200  k exceeding the measurement range of the transport setup . </S>",
    "<S> this insulating behavior of the 2lto/2lno implies the charge excitations gap opening in 2lto/2lno . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting fit to the transport data shown in inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b yields a value of @xmath41 @xmath18 0.20 ev @xmath44 0.01 ev ; this is in a accord with the theoretical prediction of the @xmath18 0.4 ev charge - transfer gap @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we estimate the value of the gap @xmath42 between empty ti @xmath35 and ni @xmath2 bands by measuring xas of the 2lto/2lno film at o k - edge . in a simple ionic model , </S>",
    "<S> the configuration of oxygen is o 1@xmath452@xmath452@xmath46 and thus the transition 1@xmath47  @xmath27  2@xmath10 is blocked in the absorption process due to it is a fully occupied 2@xmath10-shell for the o ion . in real materials , however , due to the strong hybridization , the covalent bonding between the transition metal ion and oxygen can introduce a sizable spectral weight of oxygen 2@xmath10 character in the total unoccupied density of states @xcite . as a result , o k - edge xas provides a complimentary way to probe the relative energy position of the tm ion . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out , that compared to the l@xmath20-edge xas reflecting the absorption process for the specific tm ion , o k - edge provides a convenient way to measure the relative energy position of the unoccupied bands of both tm ions ( ti and ni ) present in the 2lto/2lno  heterostructure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a direct comparison to the reference samples allows to assign the two peaks at @xmath18 530.5 ev and @xmath18 531.8 ev shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a to the hybridized oxygen 2@xmath10 with ti 3@xmath3 and ni @xmath2 bands , respectively , and then to extract the value of the mott gap @xmath42 @xmath18 1.3 ev . assuming that the bandwidth of ti 3@xmath3-o and ni @xmath2-o bands is roughly the same ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) , and with the known value of @xmath41 @xmath18 0.2 ev the estimated value of the correlated gap @xmath48 ) is @xmath18 1.5 ev ; this value is in a remarkable agreement with the theoretically predicted value of @xmath18 1.5 ev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the above observation of the two gaps - opening in the excitation spectrum lends strong support to the notion of a strong modification of the band structure at the interface triggered by the redistribution of correlated charges . </S>",
    "<S> it is also noted some additional contributions ( e.g. , disorder effect , electron - electron interactions , and charge / spin order ) @xcite may be involved in to the enhanced carrier localization of 2lto/2lno . </S>",
    "<S> however , their contributions are not dominant comparing with the large @xmath18 1.5 ev correlated gap of 2lto/2lno . as demonstrated by the angle - dependent xps on 2lto/8lno ( see supplementary fig .  4 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the formation of ni@xmath37 accompanied with the strongly suppressed density of states ( dos ) near the fermi energy level is primarily driven by the interfacial charge - transfer from ti to ni sites .    </S>",
    "<S> * orbital reconstruction . * with the established strongly altered @xmath3-band filling on ni and ti we investigated the orbital properties of these engineered states on ni sites . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , the orbital polarization has been measured by xld @xcite on several lno - based hetrostructures and the result for the lto / lno sl   is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a . based on the measured electronic state of ni </S>",
    "<S> , one can anticipate that contribution to the xld signal on ni l@xmath49-edge arises largely from the unoccupied ni @xmath50 ( @xmath51(ab ) ) and @xmath52 ( @xmath51(c ) ) states . as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a , those orbital configurations can be probed with in - plane ( @xmath53 ab , @xmath54 is the polarization vector of the photon ) and out - of - plane ( @xmath53 c ) linearly polarized photons , respectively . in a good agreement with this expectation , the xld spectra shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a shows an ample degree of orbital polarization of @xmath18 9.3% at l@xmath49-edge with the @xmath3-electron occupancy @xmath55 @xmath12 @xmath56consistent with the first principle calculation prediction of @xmath18 9% ( see calculation details in methods ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the surprising feature of the xld data for 2lto/2lno is the presence of @xmath2 band splitting ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4b , c ) that was not observed in tensile - strained ultra - thin lno films or sl ( 1u.c.)lanio@xmath0/(1u.c.)laalo@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the band splitting is generally estimated by the peak energy shift of xas ( between @xmath51(ab ) and @xmath51(c ) ) with linearly polarized photons and the lineshape of xld [ @xmath51(ab)-@xmath51(c ) ] with multiple peak features does not infer the size of the band splitting directly . in the case of 2lto/2lno </S>",
    "<S> , however , small tensile strain of + 1.04 % causes the sizable @xmath2 band splitting . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , as seen in inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4b , c , a direct inspection of the energy position for in - plane ( @xmath18 853.15 ev ) and out - of - plane ( @xmath18 853.0 ev ) absorption curves reveal that the out - of - plane absorption is @xmath18 0.15 ev ( 0.12 ev ) lower in energy than the in - plane absorption at ni l@xmath0(l@xmath40)-edge . </S>",
    "<S> the difference implies the @xmath2 band splitting @xmath57 @xmath18 0.15 ev between the states with ni @xmath50 and @xmath52 orbital character , as schematically illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4d , e . </S>",
    "<S> this observation lends strong support to the recently predicted by theory ( see calculation details in methods ) both band splitting and orbital polarization arise from the structural distortions at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> the apical oxygen atom of out - of - plane ni - o - ti bond approaches ti and leaves away from ni atoms whereas the in - plane ni - o bond length is changed little and smaller than the out - of - plane ni - o bond length . </S>",
    "<S> this extended out - of - plane ni - o bond leads to the lowering of ni @xmath52 central band energy , on the other hand , it also obviously weakens the hybridization between o @xmath58 and ni @xmath52 bands with suppressed virtual electron hopping . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the larger hybridization between o @xmath58 and ni @xmath50 bands results in a higher electron occupancy at higher ni @xmath50(minority spin ) orbital band @xmath59 @xmath12 @xmath60 which is very unusual .    in conclusion , by synthesizing the 2lto/2lno interface as a prototypical system , we investigated the reconstruction of the local electronic structure on ni and ti at the interface between a doped mott - hubbard insulator and a charge - transfer metal . </S>",
    "<S> our findings reveal the occurrence of large charge - transfer from the ti to ni sites across the interface that results in the unusual electronic configurations of ni 3@xmath3-electrons and lead to the strong modification of the band structure in the vicinity of the interface . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the xld data show the presence of the large orbital polarization and energy splitting of the ni @xmath2 band at the vicinity of the interface characteristic of the jahn - teller distortion absent in either bulk rare - earth nickelates or other ultra - thin lno based heterojunctions . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that these results will pave the way for follow up theoretical and experimental work with other important classes of charge - transfer interfaces to establish a discovery platform for exotic many - body quantum phenomena .    * methods *    * experiment details . * </S>",
