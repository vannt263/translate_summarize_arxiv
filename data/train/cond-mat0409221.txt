    "over last couple of decades , unique physical properties due to quantum confinement effects have been reported for a wide range of semiconductor nanocrystalline materials @xcite . since in these systems surface to volume ratio",
    "is high compared to that of corresponding bulk materials , surface states play a crucial role in determining their physical properties .",
    "the surface of nanocrystals is made of atoms that are not fully coordinated .",
    "hence , they are highly active and these surface atoms act like defect states unless they are passivated by either organic ligands or higher bandgap semiconductor materials @xcite .",
    "thus , the current direction in this field of research includes modification of given size - quantized semiconductor particles by means of surface chemistry . in the literature",
    ", we find reports on quantum dot - quantum well ( qdqw ) and core - shell nanocrystalline structures due to surface modifications of the particles .",
    "qdqw is a three layered structure consisting of a size quantized particle acting as a core [ marked a in fig .",
    "1(a ) ] and a complete layer of another material on the surface [ marked b in fig .",
    "1(a ) ] of this core , which is again covered by core material as an outermost shell .",
    "this core - shell - core structure is marked as a - b - a in fig .",
    "colloquially , these particular structures are also called nano - onions. recently , dorfs and eychmller have outlined the preparation and characterization of a series of qdqw systems containing two wells @xcite .",
    "coating nanoparticles by another material yields core - shell nanocrystals [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] @xcite .",
    "= 4.5 in    in core - shell strucure , like inorganic epitaxial shell growth , the organic ligands can not passivate both cationic and anionic surface sites of the core @xcite .",
    "the particles passivated by inorganic shell structures are more robust than organically passivated nanocrystals and have greater tolerance to processing conditions necessary for incorporation into solid structures @xcite . for effective surface passivation ,",
    "the core particles having certain band gap are capped with a higher band gap material . moreover ,",
    "the conduction band energy of the capping ( shell ) material is usually higher than that of the core material with the valence band energy of the capping material being lower .",
    "this energetic situation is called a type- i structure @xcite . due to presence of higher band gap capping material ,",
    "the photogenerated excitons in the core remain localized in the same region and are forced to recombine while spatially confined in the core .",
    "confinement of electrons in the nanocrystals gives rise to blue shift in optical absorption and pl spectra of the material .",
    "as the non - radiative decay channels through surface states are not accessible for these electrons , core - shell structures thus formed show higher luminescence quantum yields @xcite lower fluorescence life time @xcite and many other benefits @xcite related to tuning of band gap in two materials .    like electrons ,",
    "phonons are also confined in nanocrystals . in bulk crystals ,",
    "the phonon eigenstate is a plane wave and wavevector selection rule for the first order raman scattering requires @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the spatial correlation function of the phonon becomes finite due to its confinement in the nanocrystal and hence the @xmath0 selection rule gets relaxed .",
    "in general , the phonon - dispersion curves of bulk crystals show the frequency @xmath1 to be a decreasing function of wavevector @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the first order raman line shifts and broadens towards the low frequency side for the nanocrystals .",
    "this has been proposed and explained by phonon confinement model @xcite .",
    "confinement of phonons for si , ge , bn , cds , cds@xmath3se@xmath4 and many other nanocrystals have been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "as mentioned before , surface states play an important role in deciding different physical properties of nanocrystals . for a plane wave propagating in the x - direction in a bulk crystal , the temporal and spatial variation of the wave",
    "is described by the factor @xmath5 $ ] , where the wavevector @xmath6 ; @xmath7 is the dielectric constant of the crystal . in the frequency range between bulk longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonon frequency , @xmath8 , and transverse optical ( to ) mode frequency , @xmath9 , @xmath10",
    ", @xmath11 is imaginary .",
    "therefore , in this frequency range the wave decays exponentially in the medium , i.e. it can not propagate in bulk crystals and only surface modes exist @xcite .",
    "because of enhanced surface to volume ratio these modes appear for nanocrystals and it provides relevant information on surface states .",
    "recently , baranov et al have reported the surface phonon modes in zns shelled cdse particles @xcite .",
    "characteristics of bare cdse nanocrysals are now well established .",
    "cdse nanocrystals passivated with long organic chain ( like topo ) have room temperature photoluminescence ( pl ) ( quantum yield 10@xmath12 ) with very long fluorescence time @xcite . the inorganic shelling of cdse core by cds has also been explored and shown to be better for surface passivation .",
    "previous hrtem and xps measurements have shown that shell growth in this system does not form an alloy @xcite .",
    "the lattice mismatch of 3.9@xmath12 between cds and cdse is small enough to allow epitaxial growth while still preventing alloying .",
    "moreover , the difference in band gap ( 2.42 ev for cds and 1.74 ev for cdse at room temperature ) is large enough for shell growth .",
    "the room temperature pl yield for cdse - cds core - shell system has been reported to be upto 50@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure in this material can be understood from molecular orbital model and particle in a box model , as discussed in ref .",
    "the same has also been discussed from the analysis of photoelectron spectra from core - shell structure @xcite .",
    "the high photostability of the system has been explained by confinement of electrons and holes in the core - shell region .    in this article , we have discussed the optical properties of marcaptoacetic acid stabilized bare cdse particles and cds capped cdse particles .",
    "the nanoparticles have been characterized by their absorption spectra as well as by high resolution transmission electron microscope ( hrtem ) images .",
    "the optical transition is modeled using effective bond order model ( ebom ) .",
    "average particle size and size distribution of the particles have been estimated from both hrtem images and optical absorption measurements ; which have been further supported by raman measurements .",
    "we have quantitatively analyzed asymmetric raman line shapes including both confined optic modes and surface phonon modes .",
    "the observed frequencies of the sp modes in these systems have been compared with the calculations based on the dielectric response function model . in section",
    "ii of this article , we have briefly discussed the sample preparation procedure , which we have followed .",
    "section iii deals with analysis of hrtem images of the samples .",
    "section iv demonstrates the optical properties of the samples , studied by optical absorption and pl spectroscopy .",
    "detail analysis of phonon spectra is reported in section v. finally , in section vi , we have summarized our results with a few concluding remarks .",
    "for sample preparation , cadmium perchlorate , [ cd(clo@xmath13)@xmath14 and marcaptoacetic acid [ hs - ch@xmath15-cooh ] were purchased from aldrich , usa and loba chemie , india respectively .",

    "1.0 gm of se powder was added in 200 ml ( 1.1 m ) hot na@xmath15so@xmath17 solution under stirring condition and then boiled for half an hour .",
    "subsequently , the solution was cooled at room temperature and the aqueous layer was filtered using whatman filter paper .",

    "et al _ @xcite , 150 ml of cd(clo@xmath13)@xmath15 ( 2 x 10@xmath19 m ) and 150 ml of hs - ch@xmath15-cooh ( 2 x10@xmath19 m ) were mixed and stirred vigorously for about 5 min . here , the latter acts as a stabilizing agent .",
    "the ph of the solution was adjusted to 9.0 by adding aqueous naoh ( 1.0 m ) solution and heated to 100@xmath20c under n@xmath15 atmosphere .",
    "subsequently , 0.5 ml of na@xmath15seso@xmath17 was added drop wise to the solution and boiled again for about half an hour under stirring condition .",

    "for the preparation of coated cdse - cds particle , the above cdse solution was cooled to 50@xmath20c and 20 @xmath21l of cd(clo@xmath13)@xmath15 ( 0.1 m ) and 20 @xmath21l of na@xmath15s ( 0.1 m ) were added drop wise alternatively under stirring condition in n@xmath15 atmosphere . after 30 min of stirring the solution turned orange - red in color due to formation of cdse - cds core - shell particles",
    "= 5.5 in    samples for transmission electron microscopy were deposited onto 300 mesh copper tem grids coated with 50 nm carbon films .",
    "samples a and b are suspended in water ; thus , directly added drop - wise on the grid .",
    "the excess water was allowed to evaporate in air .",
    "the grids were examined in jeol 2010 microscope with ultra - high resolution ( uhr ) microscope using a lab@xmath22 filament operated at 200 kv .",
    "hrtem images of many nanocrystals for each sample were measured and analyzed .",
    "tem has been used to determine the particle size and size distribution of the afore - mentioned nanocrsytals .",
    "also , using the high resolution tem , it is possible to confirm the core - shell structure of nanocrystals @xcite .",
    "low magnification tem micrographs are shown in fig .",

    "electron microscopy measurements provide the convincing proof of the crystalline core - shell structure of the sample .",
    "3 shows high resolution micrograph of selected nanocrystals along the line profiles .",
    "the contrast in the image depends on the electron density in the object forming the image .",
    "hence , cds is expected to show less contrast than cdse since the former has fewer electrons per unit cell .",

    "a , we observe a smooth drop in the contrast near the edge of the nanocrystal . in comparison ,",
    "the line profile of core - shell nanocrystals ( sample b ) , exhibit a trend of a stepwise - drop .",
    "the contrast can also be explained by the change in thickness of nanocrystals , but it is not very probable that it would occur in such a step - like way . from the hrtem images the average shell thickness of the particles in sample b",
    "has been estimated to be 1.2 nm .    from the micrograph [ fig .",
    "3 a ] , we have determined the lattice spacing in sample a to be 3.72  , which corresponds to ( 100 ) plane of cdse in hexagonal phase @xcite .",

    "our goal in this article was to show electron and phonon confinement in the cdse - cds core - shell nanostructure .",
    "to this end , we have first confirmed the existence of the core - shell structure in our samples , prepared by soft chemical route , using hrtem images .",
    "subsequently , to analyze the electronic transitions we focus on optical absorption measurements , supported by theoretical considerations of the effective bond order model .",
    "furthermore , the first order raman line shape of the cdse - cds nanocrystals is quantitatively explained by taking into account both confined phonon modes and sp modes .",
    "the frequencies of sp modes are shown to match well with their calculated values as obtained from the dielectric response function model .",
    "we also demonstrate that due to passivated surface states cds capped samples exhibit clear sp modes separated from lo modes in core - shell type nanocrystallites . in summery , we have presented a technique to confirm the core - shell structure in this type of semiconductor nanostructure .    while analysing the optical absorption of the cdse - cds core - shell structure using effective bond order model , we have assumed the expected electronic transitions for cdse and cds particles .",
    "the phonon confinement in the shell structure is explained by taking the shell as a thin layer on cdse core .",
    "the above assumptions may or may not play a crucial role in analyzing the data",
