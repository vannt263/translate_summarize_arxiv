    "stellar limb darkening is the wavelength - dependent diminishing of the surface brightness from the centre of the disc to the limb of the star .",
    "limb darkening affects a wide range of different astronomical observations , such as optical interferometry ( e.g. @xcite ) , microlensing light curves ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , rotational modulations @xcite , eclipsing binaries @xcite and transiting planets @xcite . due to the often subtle , profile distorting effects of limb darkening ,",
    "the parameters describing limb darkening are frequently degenerate with other model parameters of interest , and thus accurate modelling is crucial in the interpretation of such data .",
    "many of these astronomical phenomena may be described with precise closed - form analytic solutions , if one assumes a parametric limb darkening law .",
    "for example , the transit light curve may be expressed using hypergeometric functions and elliptical integrals when one adopts a polynomial law @xcite .",
    "such closed forms are not only computationally expedient to evaluate , but their parametrization also easily allows for uninformative priors on a target star s properties and bayesian model selection of different laws , since the prior volume can be directly controlled .",
    "many of the commonly employed parametric limb darkening laws have been chosen to provide the best approximation possible between stellar atmosphere model intensity profiles and simple polynomial expansions ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is because a typical approach was to regress a model to some observations whilst assuming a fixed stellar limb darkening law which most realistically described the modeller s expectation for the star .",
    "the benefits of this approach are that the parameters describing the limb darkening do not have to be varied , making the regressions considerably easier . however , an obvious consequence of this is that any model parameters derived from such an approach are fundamentally dependent upon the stellar atmosphere model adopted . an equivalent way of describing this approach is that a dirac delta function prior was adopted for the limb darkening profile , which is statistically an implausible scenario .",
    "an alternative strategy is to relax the constraint to weaker or even uninformative priors .",
    "however , the trade - off is that by adopting a finite prior volume for the parameters describing the limb darkening , it is strongly preferred to use as compact a parametric model as possible ( i.e. fewer parameters ) so that the regression algorithm can reasonably hope to explore the full parameter space .",
    "nevertheless , this is a statistically more robust approach than simply fixing these parameters , which are frequently correlated to the other model terms @xcite .",
    "an example of a weaker prior would be to regress a joint probability density function ( pdf ) to the limb darkening coefficients ( ldcs ) emerging from an ensemble of stellar atmosphere models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , even this approach is still fundamentally dependent upon stellar atmosphere models , since it is from these models that the ensemble of coefficients is initially computed .",
    "in contrast , uninformative priors make no assumption about the limb darkening profile , except for the parametric form which describes the intensity profile ( e.g. the polynomial orders used ) . such an approach may even be used to reverse engineer properties of individual stars or populations thereof @xcite , although @xcite cautions that one must carefully account for the system geometry when comparing fitted ldcs and those from stellar atmosphere models .",
    "adopting a simple parametric limb darkening law with uninformative priors is therefore a powerful way of ( i ) incorporating and propagating our ignorance about the target star s true intensity profile into the derivation of all model parameters , ( ii ) presenting results which are independent of theoretical stellar atmosphere models , ( iii ) modelling astronomical phenomenon using closed - form and thus highly expedient algorithms and ( iv ) providing insights and constraints on the fundamental properties of the target star .",
    "the most common choice of uninformative prior for ldcs is a simple uniform prior .",
    "one danger of uninformative priors is that allowing the ldcs to explore any parameter range can often lead to unphysical limb darkening profiles being explored .",
    "it is therefore necessary to impose boundary conditions which prevent such violations . in this work",
    ", we show that after imposing the said boundary conditions (  [ sub : derivation ] ) , the pdf describing an uninformative joint prior on the quadratic ldcs is a uniform , bivariate dirichlet distribution (  [ sub : dirichlet ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we show that one may efficiently sample from this distribution using a trick from the field of computer graphical programming : triangular sampling (  [ sub : triangular ] ) .",
    "this results in a new parametrization for the quadratic ldcs which samples the physically plausible range of ldcs in an optimally efficient and complete manner . by comparing our results to previously proposed parametrizations",
    ", we show that this approach is at least twice as efficient as all others (  [ sec : comp ] ) .",
    "finally , we provide optimal parametrizations using triangular sampling for other two - parameter limb darkening laws (  [ sec : otherlaws ] ) .",
    "we begin by considering the quadratic limb darkening law due its wide ranging use in a variety of fields .",
    "we first derive the boundary conditions which constrain the physically plausible range of the associated ldcs .",
    "note , this is not the first presentation of such constraints ( e.g. @xcite ) , but due to some distinct constraints present elsewhere in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) and the fact that this derivation serves as a template for the applying constraints to other two - parameter limb darkening laws ( e.g. see later  [ sec : otherlaws ] ) , we present an explicit derivation here .",
    "we begin by considering the widely used quadratic limb darkening law .",
    "the quadratic law seems to have first appeared in @xcite and is attractive due to its simple , intuitive form , flexibility to explore a range of profiles plus a fairly compact , efficient structure .",
    "the specific intensity of a star , @xmath3 , following the quadratic limb darkening may be described by    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the specific intensity at the centre of the disc , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the quadratic ldcs and @xmath8 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the emergent intensity .",
    "we may also express @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the normalized radial coordinate on the disc of the star .",
    "we wish to investigate whether imposing some physical conditions on this expression leads to any useful constraints on the allowed ranges of the coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in what follows",
    ", we define physically plausible limb darkening profiles in reference to broad bandpass photometric / imaging observations of normal main - sequence stars ( i.e. we do not consider pulsars , white dwarfs , brown dwarfs , etc ) .",
    "accordingly , we may impose the following two physical conditions :    * an everywhere - positive intensity profile , * a monotonically decreasing intensity profile from the centre of the star to the limb .",
    "condition * ( a ) * requires little justification since a negative intensity has no physical meaning and it may be expressed algebraically as @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 , or    @xmath14    the above can be evaluated in one of two extrema ; minimizing the lhs with respect to @xmath8 and maximizing the lhs with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "consider first minimizing the lhs , which is trivially found to occur for @xmath15 .",
    "this leaves us with the meaningless constraint that @xmath16 , which is of course satisfied for all @xmath6 and @xmath7 and thus leads to no useful constraints on the ldcs .",
    "the other extrema of this condition is found by evaluating the lhs at its maximum , which is again trivially found to occur when @xmath17 and leads us to    @xmath18    therefore , the physical requirement of an everywhere - positive intensity profile leads to a single constraint on the ldcs , given by equation  ( [ eqn : conditiona ] ) .",
    "next , let us enforce condition * ( b ) * , that the specific intensity is a monotonically decreasing function towards the limb .",
    "this is generally expected for any broad bandpass limb darkening profile @xcite , but some narrow spectral lines , such as si iv , could produce limb - brightened profiles @xcite . focusing on the much more common case of limb darkening though , we have    @xmath19    which is easily shown to give    @xmath20    one of the extrema of this condition is found by minimizing the lhs with respect to @xmath8 , which occurs for @xmath15 , giving    @xmath21    the other extrema occurs when we maximize the lhs with respect to @xmath8 , which occurs for @xmath17 and gives    @xmath22    we therefore derive two constraints on the ldcs from condition * ( b ) * ( equations  [ eqn : conditionb ] & [ eqn : conditionc ] ) . in total",
    "then , we have three boundary conditions on the coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 :    @xmath23      before proceeding to our new parametrization model , we pause to compare our derived boundary conditions to those in previous works .",
    "the first explicit declaration of a set of expressions used to enforce physically plausible ldcs , that we are aware of , seems to come from @xcite . here , the authors state all three of the same boundary conditions ( see  3.2 of that work ) stated here in equation  ( [ eqn : conditions ] ) .",
    "this is not surprising as @xcite enforced the same physical criteria [ i.e. conditions * ( a ) * and * ( b ) * ] to derive their expressions , i.e. an everywhere - positive intensity profile and a monotonically decreasing brightness from the centre - to - limb .",
    "another paper stating boundary conditions on the ldcs comes from @xcite , where the authors used the conditions @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we point out that the last constraint seems to be a typographical error missing a ` 2 ' , but otherwise are the same as those constraints provided here .",
    "we highlight this minor point to avoid potential confusion in comparing these works .      in order to visualize the constraints of equation  ( [ eqn : conditions ] ) , we generated @xmath6 and @xmath7 by naively randomly sampling a uniform distribution bounded by @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "for every realization , we only accept the draw if all of the constraints in equation  ( [ eqn : conditions ] ) are satisfied , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : constraints ] . iterating until @xmath29 trials were accepted",
    ", we required 3.6 million trials , i.e. an efficiency of 2.8% .",
    "this highlights how inefficient it would be to sample from such a joint distribution .     and",
    "@xmath7 from a uniform distribution between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we show the realizations which satisfy the physical constraints of equation  ( [ eqn : conditions ] ) .",
    "the black dashed lines describe the three constraints .",
    "the loci of accepted points form a triangle with a bisector inclined @xmath32 to the @xmath6-axis.__,width=8 ]    one may re - plot fig .",
    "[ fig : constraints ] using different axes to visualize the constraints in alternative ways .",
    "we found that one particularly useful way of visualizing the constraints was found by plotting @xmath33 against @xmath34 , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : triangle ] reveals the loci of points satisfying conditions * ( a ) * and * ( b * ) form a right - angled triangle .    , except that we have re - parametrized the two axes .",

    "this square describes the constraints stated in @xcite , which violate condition * ( b)*. _ , width=8 ]      for those familiar with the dirichlet distribution , the shape of fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] will bear an uncanny resemblance to the uniform , bivariate dirichlet distribution .",
    "the dirichlet distribution is a multivariate generalization of the beta distribution ( which itself has useful applications as a prior ; @xcite ) . aside from being able to exactly reproduce the distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] , the bivariate dirichlet distribution is able to reproduce a diverse range of profiles with just three so - called ` concentration ' parameters ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the pdf is given by    @xmath38 } { \\gamma[\\alpha_1 ] \\gamma[\\alpha_2 ] \\gamma[\\alpha_3 ] } , \\label{eqn : dirichlet}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; otherwise @xmath42 . in the case of the uniform distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] , one may simply use @xmath43 :    @xmath44    the bivariate dirichlet distribution is also uniquely defined over the range @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath41 and naturally integrates to unity over this range .",
    "it may therefore be used to serve as a proper prior .",
    "consider the special case where one requires sampling from a uniform prior in the joint distribution @xmath47 ( but wishes to enforce that all sampled realizations are physical ) .",
    "this corresponds to the uniform , bivariate dirichlet distribution described by equation  ( [ eqn : dirichlet ] ) with @xmath48 .",
    "one therefore needs to simply draw a random variate in @xmath49 from the uniform , bivariate dirichlet distribution .",
    "however , another way of thinking about the problem is to try to populate a triangle with a uniform sampling of points , as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] - a procedure we dub ` triangular sampling ' .",
    "this more geometric perspective leads to a simple and elegant expression for generating the ldc samples .",
    "an elegant method for triangular sampling comes from the field of computer graphical programming , which we will describe here .",
    "consider a triangle with vertices @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and two random uniform variates @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the interval @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "@xcite showed that a random location , @xmath55 , within the triangle can be sampled using ( notation has been changed slightly from that of @xcite )    @xmath56    this sampling is equivalent to having @xmath53 draw out a line segment parallel to @xmath57 that joins a point on @xmath58 with a point on @xmath59 and then selecting a point on this segment based upon the value of @xmath54 ( as shown in fig .",

    "for example , one would fit for @xmath53 and @xmath54 with uniform priors between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , but convert these parameters into @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( using equation  15 & 16 ) before calling their light curve generation code e.g. the @xcite algorithm .",
    "this will exactly reproduce the uniform , bivariate dirichlet distribution shown in fig .",

    ", one adopts uninformative priors in the ldcs and thus the underlying intensity profile of a given star . the only physics which goes into our model are the conditions * ( a ) * and * ( b)*. in contrast , ldcs generated using stellar atmosphere models include a great deal of physics , and sampling coefficients from such a model is more appropriately described as using informative priors .",
    "the choice as to which path to follow is a matter for the data analyst to decide and is likely dependent upon how well characterized the target star is and how much trust is placed in the theoretical models .",
    "an implicit expectation of our @xmath70 model is that the true ldcs of normal stars observed in a broad bandpass should fall within the unit - square of @xmath73 and @xmath74 . by extension then , the ldcs of a realistic stellar atmosphere should also reproduce coefficients lying within this unit - square . to check this",
    ", we here show the results of converting standard tabulations of quadratic ldcs into the @xmath70 parametrization .",
    "we decide to use the _ kepler _ bandpass for this comparison since our model is ( a ) designed for broad bandpass photometry , ( b ) most useful for faint target stars with poor characterization requiring uninformative priors and ( c ) likely to be most commonly employed on such targets due to the sheer volume of observations obtained by this type of survey .",

    "in order to give our proposed parametrization some context , we here discuss previously suggested parametrizations of the ldc , with sole attention given to the quadratic law @xcite , due to its very frequent use , particularly in the transiting exoplanet community .",
    "there have been numerous distinct suggestions for reasonable parametrizations in the exoplanet literature , and here , we attempt to compare our proposed parametrization to those of the previous ones ( that we are aware of at least ) .      before we continue , there is an important point we would like to establish .",
    "many of the previous suggestions have been designed to minimize the correlation between the two fitted limb darkening parameters whilst regressing data and _ not _ specifically designed to sample the physically plausible solutions in an efficient and complete manner ( which is the motivation behind our parametrization ) .",
    "so , which motivation is preferable ?",
    "in most cases , astronomical data do not usually constrain freely fitted ldcs particularly well .",
    "for example , for rotational modulations the limb darkening profile is degenerate with the spots contrasts and geometries @xcite . in the case of transiting planets or eclipsing binaries ,",
    "the ldcs are degenerate with the geometry and size of the eclipsing body @xcite .",
    "therefore , in most cases , the data are essentially unconstraining and we do not improve our ignorance of the true profile significantly .",
    "the power of our technique lies in the fact that by efficiently sampling the entire physically plausible parameter volume , we propagate that ignorance into the posterior distributions of all of the parameters which are correlated to the ldcs .",
    "so by fitting for @xmath83 with uniform priors over the interval @xmath2 $ ] , the derived posteriors account for the full range of physically permissible models .",
    "additionally , the only consequence of fitting two parameters with non - zero mutual correlation is that more computational resources are required to obtain a converged solution e.g. for markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) this would require a greater chain length .",
    "however , this issue is actually somewhat less important in the modern age of computing with significant strides in cpu speeds .",
    "we therefore argue that it is more valuable to sample from a physically plausible prior volume .    finally , it is important to realize that despite the very wide use of mcmc techniques , other regression techniques are becoming increasingly popular and have different issues affecting their efficiency .",
    "suppose a set of data strongly constrains the quadratic ldcs .",
    "for mcmc @xcite , one could seed the chain from the approximate solution location and because the data is constraining , the chain should never cross the three boundary conditions ( i.e. it is highly efficient ) .",
    "in contrast , for nested sampling @xcite , the initial nests stretch across the entire prior volume and thus any regions which violate the boundary conditions would have to be rejected through a likelihood penalty , and thus the larger this region is , the poorer the efficiency of the nested sampling algorithm . as a side note , in the case of poorly constraining data , nested sampling is the more efficient code since the mcmc routine would randomly walk into unphysical territory frequently , but ( with well - chosen priors ) nested sampling will not .    despite not being designed to minimize the mutual correlation between the two fitted ldcs ,",
    "numerical experiments show that our parametrization does in fact reduce the correlation significantly . in recent months",
    ", the hunt for exomoons with kepler ( hek ) project @xcite has been employing our proposed parametrization during their fits of _ kepler _ transiting planetary candidates , and initial results find that the mutual correlation is reduced from a median value of @xmath86=-0.89 $ ] to @xmath87=-0.37 $ ] ( see table  [ tab : correls ] ) .",
    "the reason why our parametrization reduces the correlation can be explained geometrically and is discussed in ",
    "[ sub : pal ] .",
    "we therefore argue that efficient , complete sampling of the physically plausible prior volume has many advantages over simply reducing mutual correlation , which is why we have pursued such an approach in this paper .",
    "a by - product of our proposition is that mutual correlations are significantly reduced anyway .",

    "although the quadratic limb darkening is the most widely used two - parameter limb darkening in the literature , the so - called ` square - root ' law and to a lesser extent the ` logarithmic ' law have also gained traction . like the quadratic case ,",
    "enforcing the physical conditions of an everywhere - positive intensity profile and a monotonically decreasing intensity from centre - to - limb imposes three boundary conditions on the two coefficients describing each law .",
    "hence , we once again have a two - dimensional plane featuring three ( non - parallel ) boundary conditions which enclose a triangle . therefore",
    ", sampling from this triangle in a uniform manner can be achieved using exactly the same trick described for the quadratic law case .",
    "one can actually take this a step further and state that for _ any _ problem with two variables with a uniformly distributed joint pdf and three ( non - parallel ) boundary conditions , 100% complete and efficient sampling is easily achieved using the triangular sampling technique discussed in this paper .      arguably , the second - most popular two - parameter limb darkening law is that of the square - root law . @xcite",

    ", we show that our parametrization also reduces the mutual correlation between the two ldcs (  [ sub : correls ] ) with a natural geometric explanation (  [ sub : pal ] ) , although this was not the motivation behind our formulation .",
    "fitting astronomical data with our parametrization for the ldcs ensures that all model parameters fully account for one s ignorance about the stellar intensity profile , leading to more realistic uncertainty estimates .",

    "<S> stellar limb darkening affects a wide range of astronomical measurements and is frequently modelled with a parametric model using polynomials in the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the emergent intensity . </S>",
    "<S> two - parameter laws are particularly popular for cases where one wishes to fit freely for the limb darkening coefficients ( i.e. an uninformative prior ) due to the compact prior volume and the fact that more complex models rarely obtain unique solutions with present data . in such cases , we show that the two limb darkening coefficients are constrained by three physical boundary conditions , describing a triangular region in the two - dimensional parameter space . we show that uniformly distributed samples may be drawn from this region with optimal efficiency by a technique developed by computer graphical programming : triangular sampling . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one can make draws using a uniform , bivariate dirichlet distribution . we provide simple expressions for these parametrizations for both techniques applied to the case of quadratic , </S>",
    "<S> square - root and logarithmic limb darkening laws . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the case of the popular quadratic law , we advocate fitting for @xmath0 and @xmath1 with uniform priors in the interval @xmath2 $ ] to implement triangular sampling easily . </S>",
    "<S> employing these parametrizations allows one to derive model parameters which fully account for our ignorance about the intensity profile , yet never explore unphysical solutions , yielding robust and realistic uncertainty estimates . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in the case of triangular sampling with the quadratic law , our parametrization leads to significantly reduced mutual correlations and provides an alternative geometric explanation as to why naively fitting the quadratic limb darkening coefficients precipitates strong correlations in the first place .    </S>",
