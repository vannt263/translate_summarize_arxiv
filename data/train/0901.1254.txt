    "among the several models of spontaneous wave function collapse which has been considered so far , the so  called qmupl ( quantum mechanics with universal position localization ) model is particularly interesting , being it a very good compromise between mathematical simplicity and physical adequacy .",
    "it was first introduced by diosi  @xcite and subsequently studied in  @xcite , both from the mathematical as well as physical point of view .",
    "it is particularly relevant because it is the simplest model describing the evolution of the wave function of a system of @xmath0 distinguishable particles , subject to a spontaneous collapse in space ; as such , it can be analyzed in great mathematical detail .",
    "the model is defined by the following stochastic differential equation ( sde ) : @xmath1 \\psi_{t}(\\ { x \\});\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath2 denotes the coordinates of the @xmath0 particles ( for simplicity , we will work in one spatial dimension ) .",
    "the operator @xmath3 is the standard quantum hamiltonian of the composite system ; @xmath4 is the position operator associated to the @xmath5-th particle and @xmath6 denotes the quantum expectation value of @xmath4 .",
    "the stochastic processes @xmath7 are @xmath0 independent standard wiener processes defined on a probability space @xmath8 , and the parameters @xmath9 are @xmath0 positive coupling constants which is convenient to take proportional to the mass of the particle according to the formula  @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mass of the @xmath5-th particle , @xmath12 is a reference mass which , at the non relativistic level , is reasonable to take equal to the mass of a nucleon ( @xmath13 kg ) , while @xmath14 is the only true new parameter of the model , whose value sets the strength of the collapse mechanism .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath14 has to be chosen in such a way that : i ) the model reproduces quantum mechanical predictions for microscopic systems ; ii ) it rapidly induces the collapse of the wave function describing the center of mass of a macroscopic object . in the literature , two quite different values for @xmath14",
    "have been proposed , the first by ghirardi , rimini , and weber  @xcite , and the second by adler  @xcite : @xmath15 grw s choice is motivated by the requirement that superpositions of order @xmath16 nucleons , displaced by a distance of at least @xmath17 cm , be suppressed within @xmath18 sec .",
    "adler s choice instead is motivated by the requirement that the collapse occurs already at the level of latent image formation .",
    "more specifically , grw set @xmath19 sec@xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the collapse rate of the grw model  @xcite ; adler instead set @xmath22",
    "@xmath23 sec@xmath20  @xcite , where @xmath24 is the noise - strength coupling constant of the csl model ; the relation between @xmath25 of our model and @xmath21 and @xmath24 is  @xcite : @xmath26 , with @xmath27 .",
    ".   is manifestly not linear , which makes it difficult to analyze , in particular it makes it hard to find its solutions .",
    "the way to circumvent this obstacle is to linearize the equation , according to the following prescription  @xcite . consider the linear sde : @xmath28 \\phi_{t}(\\ { x \\}),\\ ] ] where the stochastic processes @xmath29 are @xmath0 independent standard wiener processes with respect to a new measure @xmath30 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath31 is a martingale , which can be used to generate a new measure from a given one : the measure @xmath32 introduced here above is chosen in such a way that @xmath31 is the radon - nikodyn derivative of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath32 , i.e. : @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , girsanov s theorem  @xcite states that the two sets of wiener processes @xmath35 and @xmath36 are related as follows : @xmath37 .    given these ingredients , it is easy to relate the solutions of eq .   to those of eq .  : given a solution @xmath38 of eq .",
    ", one first considers the normalized state @xmath39 , and then replaces the noises @xmath36 with @xmath35 according to the formula given above .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the wave function so obtained solves eq .  .",
    "further details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze the generalization of the qmupl model to non - markovian gaussian random processes . as discussed in  @xcite , the generalization of the linear eq .   to",
    "the non - markovian case takes the form : @xmath40 \\phi_{t}(\\ { x \\}),\\ ] ] where the noises @xmath41 are now supposed to be _ gaussian random processes _ whose mean and correlation function , expressed with respect to the measure @xmath32 , are equal to : @xmath42 = 0 , \\qquad\\quad { \\mathbb e}_{\\mathbb q } [ w_{n}(t ) w_{m}(s ) ] = d_{nm}(t , s).\\ ] ] the correlation function is assumed to be real , symmetric and positive - semidefinite  @xcite .",
    "like in the white - noise case , eq .   does not preserve the norm of the wave function .",
    "accordingly , we assume that the _ physical states _ are the normalized states : @xmath43 moreover , we assume that the _ physical probability _ measure is @xmath33 , which is related to the measure @xmath32 , by means of which the statistical properties of the noises @xmath44 have been defined , according to the formula : @xmath45 _ measurable quantities _ are given by expressions of the form : @xmath46 $ ] , where @xmath47 is a suitable self adjoint operator . according to relation  , the following equality holds true : @xmath48 \\ ; \\equiv \\ ; { \\mathbb e}_{\\mathbb p } [ \\langle \\phi_{t } | o | \\phi_t \\rangle ] .\\ ] ] we then have the following useful results : physical properties can be computed directly from the solution of the linear equation  , if one averages with respect to the measure @xmath32 , instead of the physical measure @xmath49 . for this reason , in the following we will focus our attention only on eq .  , without trying to investigate the form of the corresponding non - linear but norm - preserving equation",
    ". this will be the subject of future analysis .",
    "the goal of the paper is to unfold the dynamics described by eq .  .",
    "we will focus our attention on the free particle case , which can be solved exactly .",

    "we have studied the time evolution of gaussian wave functions , analyzing in particular the time evolution of the spread in position , and how the fluctuations around the average of both the mean position and mean momentum scale with the mass of the particle . in all cases ,",
    "we have recovered the results which hold true for the white noise models .    before concluding this introductory section , two comments are at order .",
    "first , it may seem rather remarkable that we have been able to compute the green s function associated to a non - markovian equation .",
    "in fact , dynamics with memory terms in general do now allow for solutions expressed in terms of a green s function , whose nature is strictly linked to the markovian character of the evolution .",
    "the fact that in our case we have been able to compute the green s function appears less surprising if one looks at the way in which eq .   has been derived : originally , the non - markovian evolution was presented only in terms of a propagator ( see the pioneering works of feynman and vernon on decoherence  @xcite and of p. pearle  @xcite on collapse models ) and only afterwards a non - markovian equation was devised , having that propagator as the associated green s function  @xcite .",
    "second , it may appear odd that the integration interval in eq",
    ".   starts from 0 and not from @xmath88 , as required by a truly non - markovian dynamics .",
    "here we are implicitly making the assumption that the state at time @xmath89 suffices to compute the subsequent evolution , without any need to know also the previous history of the system .",
    "this assumption , which actually is an approximation if the equation is taken as a fundamental equation , is based on the following argument .",
    "we assume that before @xmath89 the system had enough time to reach some equilibrium state , which does not depend on the way it has been reached ; this is the physical argument behind the idea that the history prior to @xmath89 is unimportant .",
    "then , at time @xmath89 a sudden change in the system occurs  e.g .",
    ", due to a measurement - like interaction : eq .   describes how the system evolves thereafter .",
    "let us suppose that the total hamiltonian @xmath3 of eq",
    ".   separates in a term referring only to the center of mass and one referring to the relative degrees of freedom : @xmath90 . in this section",
    "we analyze under which conditions the dynamics of the two types of motion decouple from each other . to this end , let us introduce the center of mass position operator @xmath91 and the relative position operators @xmath92 defined as follows : @xmath93 we will choose @xmath91 and @xmath94 as a set of independent variables , while @xmath95 is given in terms of the other operators according to the formula : @xmath96    the second term on the right hand side of eq .   trivially separates in a term depending only on @xmath91 and a term depending only on the relative variables , as the following equality holds true : @xmath97 the above expression suggests to define the following new stochastic processes : @xmath98 with @xmath59 yet to be defined .",
    "the first noise is associated to the center - of - mass motion , the remaining ones are associated to the relative motion .",
    "in such a way , eq",
    ".   becomes : @xmath99 the new noises here introduced are still gaussian processes with zero mean ; a crucial role is of course played by their second moments .",
    "the correlation function between @xmath58 and @xmath100 is equal to : @xmath101 \\ ; = \\ ; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}\\ , \\sum_{m=1}^{n } \\left [ \\sqrt{\\lambda_{m } } d_{mn}(t , s ) - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda_{n}\\lambda_{m}}{\\lambda_{n}}}\\ , d_{mn}(t , s ) \\right ] , \\qquad n=1,2 , \\ldots n-1.\\ ] ] as we shall see soon , the _ necessary condition _ in order for the two types of motion to decouple is that the above expression vanishes @xmath102 \\ ; = \\ ; 0 , \\qquad n=1,2 , \\ldots n-1,\\ ] ] i.e. that @xmath58 be statistically independent from the other noises .",
    "this condition is automatically satisfied if the original noises @xmath41 are _ independent _ and _ identically _ distributed , i.e. if @xmath103 which is what it is usually assumed in white - noise collapse models ( see eq .  ) . throughout the rest of the section",
    "we will assume that this condition is satisfied .",
    "the correlation function of @xmath58 is equal to : @xmath104 \\ ; = \\ ; \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\ , \\left ( \\sum_{n=1}^{n } \\lambda_{n } \\right)\\ , d(t , s)\\,;\\ ] ] this expression suggests to set the value of the coupling constant @xmath59 first introduced in eq .",
    "equal to : @xmath105 so that the correlation function of the center - of - mass noise is identical to that of the noises associated to each single constituent .",
    "thus , in accordance with what happens in the white noise case , the collapse coupling constant associated to the center - of - mass motion is proportional to the total mass of the system ; as we shall see in the subsequent sections , this means that the collapse mechanism scales with the size of the system .",
    "according to the previous assumptions , the correlation functions of the noises @xmath100 are equal to : @xmath106 & = & c_{nm}\\ , d(t , s),\\\\   c_{nm } & \\equiv & \\delta_{nm } \\ , + \\ , \\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda_{n } \\lambda_{m}}}{\\lambda_{n}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath107 .",
    "it easy to prove that the matrix @xmath108 , having @xmath109 as coefficients , is positive - definite .",
    "in fact one can write @xmath110 , where @xmath111 are two @xmath112-dimensional vectors , @xmath113 and @xmath114 according to statement 3.5.14 at page 93 in  @xcite , @xmath108 is positive definite iff @xmath115 , inequality that can be easily verified with our definitions of @xmath116 and @xmath117 : @xmath118    moreover , @xmath108 is real and symmetric , thus there exists an orthogonal matrix @xmath47 which diagonalizes it : @xmath119 where the eigenvalues @xmath120 of the matrix @xmath121 are real and positive , since @xmath108 is positive definite .",
    "it is convenient to diagonalize  the processes @xmath122 by defining the new stochastic processes : @xmath123 an easy calculation shows that they are independent and identically distributed gaussian processes with zero mean and correlation function equal to @xmath124 . by defining also : @xmath125 one can easily verify that the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "can be rewritten as : @xmath126    to summarize , the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "becomes @xmath127 we now examine the third term of eq .  . after some easy calculations ,",
    "one finds the following result : @xmath128\\ , \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta w(s ) }   +   \\sqrt{\\lambda}\\ , q \\sum_{n=1}^{n-1 }",
    "\\int_{0}^{t } ds\\ , { \\mathbb e}_{\\mathbb q } [ w(t)\\ , \\tilde{w}_{n}(s)]\\ , \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\tilde{w}_{n}(s ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{n=1}^{n-1 } \\sqrt{\\lambda_{n}}\\ , \\tilde{q}_{n } \\int_{0}^{t } ds\\ , { \\mathbb e}_{\\mathbb q } [ \\tilde{w}_{n}(t)\\ , w(s)]\\ , \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta w(s ) } + \\sum_{n , m=1}^{n-1 } \\sqrt{\\lambda_{n}}\\ , \\tilde{q}_{n } \\int_{0}^{t } ds\\ , { \\mathbb e}_{\\mathbb q } [ \\tilde{w}_{n}(t)\\ , \\tilde{w}_{m}(s)]\\ , \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\tilde{w}_{m}(s)}.\\hspace{1cm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as we see , the second and third term at the right hand side of the above equation vanish when condition   is satisfied , in which case the variables relative to the motion of the center of mass and those relative to the motion of the relative degrees of freedom decouple .",
    "this is the desired result .",
    "moreover , under condition   one can rewrite eq .   as follows : @xmath129    to summarize the results so far obtained , we have seen that when condition   is satisfied , the center of mass motion and the relative motion decouple ; under the simplifying assumption  , the equation for the center of mass becomes : @xmath130 \\phi_{t}^{\\text{\\tiny cm}},\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 have been defined in   and   respectively .",
    "the equation for the relative motion instead becomes : @xmath131 \\phi_{t}^{\\text{\\tiny rel}},\\ ] ] where @xmath60 and @xmath61 have been defined in   and   respectively .",
    "we stress once more a crucial feature of the model , the amplification mechanism : according to eq .",
    ", the coupling between the noise and the center of mass , thus the collapse strenght , scales with the size of the system . on the other side , relative degrees of freedom",
    "are coupled to the noise through @xmath132 , which do not scale with the size of the system , and remain small .",
    "this is the way in which the model described by eq .",
    "describes both classical properties of macroscopic objects ( large values of @xmath62 ) and quantum properties of microscopic systems ( small values of @xmath62 ) .",
    "now we restrict our attention to the dynamics of a free quantum particle of mass @xmath62 .",
    "eq .   then becomes : @xmath133 \\phi_t(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath124 is the correlation function of the gaussian noise @xmath58 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , this same equation describes also the dynamics of the center of mass of an isolated system ( in particular , a macroscopic object ) of total mass @xmath62 .",
    "aim of this section is to find the explicit solution of eq .  .",
    "in  @xcite it has been shown that the green s function @xmath134 of eq .",
    "allows for the following path - integral representation : @xmath135 e^{\\mathcal{s}[q ] } \\,,\\ ] ] where , as indicated , the integration is carried out over all the paths connecting @xmath136 to @xmath137 .",
    "the ` action ' @xmath138 $ ] , which contrary to the standard quantum case , has both a real and an imaginary part , is : @xmath139 \\ ; = \\ ; \\int^t_0 ds \\left [ \\frac{i m}{2\\hbar}\\ , q'^2(s ) + \\sqrt{\\lambda } q(s ) w(s ) -",
