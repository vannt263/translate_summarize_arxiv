    "gravity in higher dimensions has been an important scenario to test how generic are the notions we have gained from four - dimensional gravity . also motivated by string theory and supergravity",
    ", many results have been learned in the last decades concerning gravity in dimensions higher than four , as for example the existence of the asymptotically flat black rings and all its extensions ( for a review see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these objects were conjectured to be unstable for large angular momentum , as they inherit the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite of non - extremal black strings and black p - branes @xcite-@xcite . indeed the black ring instability has been confirmed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the gregory - laflamme instability can be guessed from thermodynamical arguments since , as a function of the mass , the entropies of the black hole and the black string cross at a given critical mass @xmath2 .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the entropy of the black hole grows as @xmath3 , while the entropy of the black string grows as @xmath4 . for masses below @xmath2 ,",
    "the black hole is thermally favoured and above @xmath2 is the black string solution the one with greater entropy and therefore the most favoured .",
    "this relation between thermal and perturbative instabilities led gubser and mitra to conjecture that both kinds of instabilities always appear together for black hole configurations with extended directions @xcite , and is was recently proved in @xcite for general relativity in vacuum . to understand the complete evolution of the unstable mode a non - linear analysis is required .",
    "recent outstanding numerical results in five dimensions seem to indicate that the black string evolves toward a non - homogenous configuration with section for which the size of the string eventually shrinks to zero generating a null singularity and providing a counterexample of the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite ( for a historical review on this problem see chapter 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting problem is whether higher curvature corrections may modify this scenario . in the particular case of higher curvature lovelock theories",
    "@xcite it is difficult to construct analytic , homogenous , black strings due to the fact that the new dimensionful coupling constants introduce a length scale that induces the existence of a cosmological constant .",
    "numerical and approximate results in this context have been reported in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "specially , in @xcite , static uniform and non - uniform black strings where constructed .",
    "the latter were constructed along the lines of @xcite , i.e. , perturbativelly in a non - homogeneity parameter and therefore can be considered as a static perturbation of the uniform black string . comparing the entropies of these configurations the authors provided evidence for the gubser and mitra conjecture in the context of einstein - gauss - bonnet theory .",
    "the situation in theories that have a single lovelock term is much more like the one in general relativity , since as shown in @xcite homogeneous black strings and black p - branes can be constructed analytically .",
    "these solutions are also important since they should be obtained as the short distance configuration ( @xmath0 ) of the black string solution of einstein - gauss - bonnet theory , which is not know analytically . here",
    "@xmath1 is the gauss - bonnet coupling .",
    "this is what occurs for example with the `` healthy branch '' of the spherically symmetric black hole in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity , which is defined by the following action:@xmath5   = \\frac{1}{16\\pi g}\\int d^{d}x\\sqrt{-g}\\left [ r+\\alpha\\left (   r^{2}-4r_{\\mu\\nu}r^{\\mu\\nu}+r_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta } r^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\\right )   \\right ]   \\ .\\ ] ]    this theory admits a the following black hole solution @xcite:@xmath6 where@xmath7   \\ .\\ ] ] where the integration constant @xmath8 , is the mass . here",
    "@xmath1 has dimensions of length square and we can analyze the behavior of this metric function for @xmath9 and @xmath10 which respectively read:@xmath11 in the former case the solution reduces to the schwarzschild - tangherlini black hole , while in the latter it reduces to the solution found in @xcite . therefore , we have that for large distances , the effects of the quadratic curvature term are sub - leading , whereas for short distance ( as compared with @xmath12 ) the quadratic terms dominate and one recovers a solutions of gauss - bonnet theory .    as shown in @xcite , the asymptotically flat black holes constructed in @xcite can be oxidated to construct homogenous black string and black p - brane solutions .",
    "these spacetimes are solutions of the theory that contains only the @xmath13 order term in the lovelock theory , being the case @xmath14 the one of general relativity .",
    "for simplicity let s consider only the quadratic gauss - bonnet term in seven dimension:@xmath5   = \\frac{\\alpha}{16\\pi g}\\int d^{7}x\\sqrt{-g}\\left [ r^{2}-4r_{\\mu\\nu}r^{\\mu\\nu}+r_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}r^{\\alpha\\beta \\gamma\\delta}\\right ]   \\ .\\ ] ] this theory has the following two solution@xmath15 and @xmath16 which correspond to an spherically symmetric black hole and a black string , respectively .",
    "the constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 determine the masses of the configurations while @xmath19 stands for the line element of the @xmath20sphere , @xmath21 .",
    "from the experience gained from the spherically symmetric black hole , one can expect that these black strings should be obtained as the short distance limit of the , not known analytically , black string of einstein - gauss - bonnet theory in seven dimensions .",
    "the black strings and black p - branes constructed in this way where proved to be thermally unstable @xcite exactly in the same manner than the black strings in general relativity , since the entropies , as a function of the mass for ( [ bh2 ] ) and ( [ bs2 ] ) read @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively and they do cross at a critical mass @xmath24 .",
    "the heat capacities of the black hole ( [ bh2 ] ) and the black hole in the transverse section of ( [ bs2 ] ) are negative ( see @xcite ) , therefore , both black objects ( [ bh2 ] ) and ( [ bs2 ] ) are locally thermally unstable ) is the same as that of the black hole on its transverse section and the mass of such black string corresponds to the mass of the black hole times the extension of the extended direction .",
    "therefore the sign of the heat capacity remains the same after the oxidation . ] .",
    "a natural question is whether such thermal instability has a perturbative counterpart . in this paper",
    "we show this is indeed the case . in the next section",
    "we show that the black strings of gauss - bonnet theory ( [ bs2 ] ) are unstable under the s - wave mode and that such instability disappears for compactified black strings that are short enough .",
    "here we will be concerned with gravitational perturbations in the context of gauss - bonnet theory .",
    "the field equations are therefore given by@xmath25 for simplicity we will focus in the seven dimensional case . as mentioned above , this theory admits the homogenous black string solution ( [ bs2 ] ) .",
    "the radius of the horizon reads @xmath26 . in order to work with a finite range of parameters ,",
    "let s consider the change in the radial coordinate given by@xmath27 that maps the region outside the event horizon @xmath28 to @xmath29",
    ". in this new coordinates the metric ( [ bs2 ] ) reads@xmath30 the s - wave perturbation on the background , black string metric ( [ bsx ] ) reads@xmath31{cc|c|c}$h_{tt}\\left (   x\\right )   $ & $ h_{tx}\\left (   x\\right )   $ & $ 0 $ & $ 0$\\\\ $ h_{tx}\\left (   x\\right )   $ & $ h_{xx}\\left (   x\\right )   $ & $ 0 $ & $ 0$\\\\\\hline $ 0 $ & $ 0 $ & $ h\\left (   x\\right )   \\sigma_{s^{4}}$ & $ 0$\\\\\\hline $ 0 $ & $ 0 $ & $ 0 $ & $ 0$\\end{tabular } \\",
    "\\right )   \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the metric of the four sphere and @xmath33 is the wave number along the @xmath34 direction .",
    "an unstable mode is defined as a bounded solution of the linearized gauss - bonnet equations ( [ feq ] ) with positive @xmath35 .",
    "it easy to show that the linearized field equations imply that the components of the perturbation can be written in terms of @xmath36 in the following manner@xmath37 where the prime ( @xmath38 ) denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "the component @xmath40 fulfils the following linear , second order , master equation @xmath41 with@xmath42 then , one can see that all the linearized field equations are solved provided ( [ ttdetx])-([hdetx ] ) and ( [ mastereq ] ) , hold .",
    "note that the master equation is invariant under@xmath43 for an arbitrary constant @xmath44 .",
    "therefore it is enough to study the existence of unstable modes for a fixed value of the horizon radius @xmath26 , since the other can be obtained by applying the scaling symmetry ( [ scalingsymmetry ] ) .",
    "we are then left with finding a well - behaved solution of the master equation ( [ mastereq ] ) .",
    "this equation implies that the solution @xmath36 admits the following asymptotic behaviors at the horizon @xmath45 and at infinity @xmath46 , respectively:@xmath47 with@xmath48 since we are looking for unstable modes , we need to find a numerical solution that interpolates between the plus sign in ( [ asymphor ] ) and the minus sign in ( [ asympinf ] ) .",
    "it s natural to think that in order to have a well posed behavior at the horizon we need to impose @xmath49 , as it was originally considered in @xcite where it was proved that in the five dimensional black string in general relativity there is no non - singular , single , unstable mode in this family ( in g.r . in five dimensions @xmath50 )",
    "nevertheless in general relativity , in the range @xmath51 one can construct a perturbation that is a composition of single divergent modes at the horizon in such a manner that the divergences cancel , as it occurs for the instabilities in some colored black holes @xcite and originally observed by vishveshwara in @xcite .",
    "this can be seen also considering the fact that a @xmath52 surface intersects the bifurcation surface rather than the future horizon .",
    "it it therefore necessary consider kruskal - like coordinates , where the @xmath53 surfaces do indeed intersect the future horizon .",
    "then , by going to kruskal coordinates , it is easy to see that the unstable modes we find below are regular at the future horizon provided we choose the branch with the plus sign in ( [ asymphor ] ) , even if @xmath54 .    in order to find whether the master equation ( [ mastereq ] ) admits a bounded solution for some positive values of @xmath35",
    ", we will follow the approach developed in @xcite for quasinormal modes .",
    "briefly , the method consists in proposing a power series solution around the horizon , then selecting the well behaved branch and finally truncate the power series to some order @xmath55 .",
    "then use the fact that , due to the pole structure of the equation such a power series has a convergence radius that at least includes @xmath56 and therefore we can request for the truncated series to vanish at infinity ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "such an equation provides for the spectrum of unstable modes .",
    "for details we refer to the original work @xcite .",
    "the results of the previous analysis are depicted in figure 1 :     vs @xmath33 for the homogeneous black string in gauss - bonnet in @xmath57 .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 in the solution has been fixed to 1 , and any value for the mass can be obtained by applying the scaling transformation in ( [ scalingsymmetry ] ) .",
    "the numerical precision is such that four digits in @xmath35s are stable ( the continuous curve has been included to facilitate the visualization ) . _",
    "_ ]    from these results we see that there is minimum wavelength @xmath58 above which instability occurs .",
    "this also implies the existence of a critical length for the string , above which the instability takes place .    as it occurs for the black string in general relativity @xcite , as far as @xmath59",
    ", one can show that the perturbation can not be gauged away . another straighforward method to check that these perturbations are physical and",
    "can not be gauged away is to consider the following scalar invariant@xmath60 which vanishes identically on the unperturbed metric , but it is non - vanishing for the perturbed black string .",
    "we have then found a set of physical s - wave modes on the black string in gauss - bonnet theory ( [ bs2 ] ) , which drive the instability of the background , and therefore black strings in gauss - bonnet theory are unstable .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the black strings in gauss - bonnet theory are unstable under gravitational perturbations . following the arguments in @xcite",
    ", one can prove that the instability we have found can not be gauged away , and therefore it represents a truly physical instability .",
    "since the field equations are quadratic in the curvature , the linearization around the maximally symmetric minkowski vacua does not provide any equation at all , therefore in order to study the perturbative properties of the solutions of gauss - bonnet gravity one needs to perturb around solutions that have a non - trivial riemann tensor as it is the case of the black string . as mentioned above the linearized equations around such a background are non - degenerate since all the perturbed metric components appear in the linearized equations . in order the black strings to be unstable",
    ", the wavelength of the perturbation along the extended direction has to be above some minimum critical value @xmath61 .",
    "this critical value tends to zero in the large @xmath62 limit in general relativity @xcite-@xcite , and since the large @xmath62 behavior of g.r .",
    "is qualitatively similar to the one in gravity theories with a single lovelock term @xcite , one may also expect @xmath63 as @xmath62 grows for the black strings and black p - branes constructed in @xcite .",
    "given the results presented in this work it is natural to expect that the black string solution of the full einstein - gauss - bonnet theory will suffer from the gregory - laflamme instability , which will induce an instability for large angular momentum in the rotating version of the static black string constructed numerically in @xcite .    for einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity different stability analysis of black holes have been performed in @xcite-@xcite and it would be interesting to extend such analysis to the whole family of black holes of @xcite , which are the black holes in the transverse section of the black strings we have considered here .",
    "it s worth also to explore whether the results presented here can be extended to all the black strings and black p - branes obtained in @xcite , and even to the compactifications with einstein manifold in four dimensions that were obtained in @xcite for lovelock theories .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
