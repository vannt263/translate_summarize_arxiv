    "passive tracers play an important role in the study of fluid motion . on the one hand ,",
    "experimental and observational studies of fluid flows rely heavily on passive tracers to deduce the advecting velocity field . on the other hand , knowledge of the underlying fluid flows",
    "is essential to predict the future dispersion of tracers ( particularly , but not exclusively , harmful ones ) .",
    "it is natural to believe that if the advecting fluid flow is turbulent ( however this is defined ) , the evolution of the tracer will be turbulent as well .",
    "following the pioneering work by kolmogorov , obukhov @xcite and corrsin @xcite argued that if the energy spectrum of the fluid is @xmath5 , a passive tracer whose dissipation rate is @xmath6 should have the spectrum @xmath7 between the injection and dissipation scales .",
    "thus , in the inertial range in 3d , both the energy and tracer spectra scale as @xmath8 .",
    "following kraichnan @xcite , in the direct enstrophy cascade range in 2d , the energy spectrum should scale as @xmath9 , giving a @xmath10 tracer spectrum .",
    "although these scaling arguments were derived with little reference to the governing equations , they have been supported to a surprising extent by experimental and numerical works ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , primarily in 3d , slightly less so for 2d and still less so for tracers .    in 3d and 2d ,",
    "respectively , dissipative effects are expected to dominate beyond the kolmogorov and kraichnan wavenumbers @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding scales for our tracer depend in addition on the schmidt number @xmath13 , i.e.  the ratio of the viscosity to the tracer dissipativity .",
    "another lengthscale of great importance is the taylor microscale . initially ( and to this day among experimentalists ) defined using the velocity correlation , mathematicians prefer to use an alternate definition for @xmath14 in terms of the energy and its dissipation rate ; the two definitions can be shown to be ( nearly ) equivalent under some assumptions . assuming that @xmath14 is much greater than the forcing scale , it has been proved rigorously that a direct energy cascade exists for solutions of 3d nse @xcite .",
    "similarly , in 2d one defines in terms of the enstrophy and its dissipation rate a wavenumber @xmath15 , which if sufficiently larger than the forcing scale rigorously implies the existence of direct enstrophy cascade @xcite . in section",
    "[ s : i - tht ] , we derive an analogous result for tracers in terms of a corresponding wavenumber @xmath16 .    while it is plausible that @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are large for turbulent solutions of the nse and the advected tracers , these remain unproved ( directly from the ns and the tracer equations ) to this day . if one were to assume the expected spectra , namely @xmath17 and @xmath18 , however , it has been shown that @xmath19 in 3d @xcite and @xmath20 up to a logarithm in 2d @xcite . following this approach , we prove the tracer analogues in sections [ 2dtracer ] and  [ 3dtracer ] .",
    "there are a number of qualitatively distinct cases here , depending on the viscosity @xmath21 and tracer dissipativity @xmath22 , as well as on the injection scales of energy @xmath23 and of the tracer @xmath24 . when @xmath25 , it is possible for @xmath16 to asymptotically approach ( up to constants and logarithms ) its largest possible value , in that @xmath26 for any @xmath27 , both for @xmath28 (  [ 2dtracer ] ) and @xmath29 (  [ 3dtracer ] ) in a periodic domain of volume @xmath30 . when @xmath31 , the situation is more complicated as discussed in detail below .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . after some mathematical setups in section  [ prelim ] , we recall the heuristic argument for the tracer spectra in section  [ connect ] .",
    "earlier nse estimates for the enstrophy and energy transfer rates in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath14 in 2d and 3d are gathered in section [ s : gen ] , along with the implications that the expected energy spectra have on these wavenumbers , vis -  - vis @xmath12 , @xmath11 , respectively .",

    "we associate to each term in a _ wavenumber _ @xmath68 .",
    "s identity reads as @xmath69 two important dimensionless parameters are the grashof and schmidt numbers , @xmath70 the former indicates the complexity of the ( velocity ) flow , and the latter the importance of ( momentum ) viscosity relative to tracer dissipativity .",
    "we define the average _ energy _ , _ enstrophy _ and _ tracer variance _",
    "@xmath71 as well as their dissipation ( diffusion ) rates @xmath72 by the classical dimensional arguments , the dissipation range is expected to start at @xmath73 in 3d and 2d respectively ; these are sometimes known as the kolmogorov and kraichnan wavenumbers .",
    "their analogues for the tracer cascade are more complicated and depend on the advecting velocity ; see @xmath74 and @xmath75 in  [ 2dtracer][3dtracer ] below .",
    "another set of important wavenumbers are @xmath76 in 3d turbulence , @xmath14 is closely related to the taylor wavenumber , the scale at which the velocity correlation is lost ; it has been shown that direct energy cascade takes place within the range @xmath77 .",
    "its analogues in 2d and tracer turbulence are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with corresponding results on enstrophy @xcite and tracer [ below ] cascades .",

    "the value of @xmath92 shall remain unspecified , and may vary from one statement involving @xmath93 to the next .",
    "since the infinite time limit is not known to exist , for each solution @xmath94 of the 2d nse ( leray  hopf weak solution in the 3d case ) we work with the average @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a hahn  banach extension of the classical time limit .",
    "the average @xmath97 is the mathematical equivalent of the ensemble average in the statistical theory of turbulence . see @xcite for more details .",

    "obukhov theory for 3d turbulence in a form suitable for its extension to passive tracers .",

    "yet a similar dimensional argument in the enstrophy inertial range leads to the kraichnan spectrum @xmath107    an analogous cascade mechanism for the tracer suggests a connection between its spectrum @xmath108 and the energy spectrum . taking the amount of tracer ( variance ) at wavenumber @xmath104 to be @xmath109 , assuming that it is transferred to wavenumber @xmath110 by the advecting velocity over a time @xmath100 given by , and setting the transfer rate to a constant @xmath6 , we find @xmath111 if we take @xmath112 in and solve for @xmath113 in , we have @xmath114      these spectral relations can be reformulated in terms of partial sums @xmath115 as @xmath116 increases ( so @xmath117 decreases ) , each quantity in can be viewed as a riemann sum approximation of the integral of the corresponding spectrum ( this assumes smoothness of the summands , but below we will use this approximation only for explicit functions of @xmath104 ) .",
