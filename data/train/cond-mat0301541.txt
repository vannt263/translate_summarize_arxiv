    "the electron - phonon interaction as an origin of high @xmath0 continues to gather support through isotope effect measurements , infrared , tunnelling , neutron and photoemission spectroscopies @xcite . to account for high values of t@xmath1 in the cuprates",
    ", it is necessary to have a strong electron - phonon interaction , when a many - electron - phonon system collapses into the small ( bi)polaron regime@xcite . at first sight",
    "these carriers have a mass too large to be mobile , however it has been shown that the inclusion of the on - site coulomb repulsion leads to the favoured binding of intersite oxygen holes@xcite .",
    "the intersite bipolarons can then tunnel with an effective mass of only 10 electron masses@xcite    mott and the author proposed a simple model@xcite of the cuprates based on bipolarons , fig.1 . in this model",
    "all the holes ( polarons ) are bound into small intersite singlet and triplet bipolarons at any temperature . above @xmath2",
    "this bose gas is non - degenerate and below @xmath2 phase coherence ( odlro ) of the preformed bosons sets in , followed by superfluidity of the charged carriers .",
    "the model accounts for the crossover regime at @xmath3 and normal state pseudogaps in cuprates@xcite . here",
    "i show that real - space pairing takes place in many cuprates .",
    "the possibility of real - space pairing , as opposed to bcs - like pairing , has been the subject of much discussion .",
    "experimental and theoretical evidence for an exceptionally strong electron - phonon interaction in high temperature superconductors is now so overwhelming , that even advocates of nonphononic mechanisms @xcite accept this fact .",
    "nevertheless the same authors @xcite dismiss any real - space pairing claiming that pairing is collective in cuprates .",
    "they believe in a large fermi surface with the number of holes @xmath4 rather than @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the doping level like in @xmath7 as an alternative to a three - dimensional bec of bipolarons these authors suggest a collective pairing ( i.e the _  cooper _ pairs in the momentum space ) at some temperature @xmath8 but without phase ordering . in this concept @xmath2 is determined by the superfluid density , which is proportional to doping @xmath5 , rather then to the total density of carriers ( @xmath9 . on the experimental side a large fermi surface is clearly incompatible with a great number of thermodynamic , magnetic , and kinetic measurements , which show that only holes _ doped _ into a parent insulator are carriers in the _ normal _ state . on the theoretical ground",
    "this preformed _",
    "cooper_-pair ( or phase - fluctuation ) scenario contradicts a theorem @xcite , which proves that the number of supercarriers ( at @xmath10 ) and normal - state carriers is the same in any _ clean _ superfluid .    here i show that objections against real - space pairing also contradict a parameter - free estimate of the fermi energy @xcite . in cuprates",
    "the band structure is quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) with a few degenerate hole pockets . applying the parabolic approximation for the band dispersion we obtain the _ renormalized _ fermi energy as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the interplane distance , and @xmath13 are the density of holes and their effective mass in each of the hole subbands @xmath14 renormalized by the electron - phonon ( and by any other ) interaction .",
    "one can express the renormalized band - structure parameters through the in - plane magnetic - field penetration depth at @xmath15 , measured experimentally : @xmath16 .",
    "in the framework of the bcs theory this expression is applied to any @xmath17 superfluid , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the @xmath20 state mass and density of carriers , respectively . as a result",
    ", we obtain a _ parameter - free _",
    "expression for the `` true '' fermi energy as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the degeneracy of the spectrum which might depend on doping in cuprates . because eq.(1 ) does not contain any other band - structure parameters ,",
    "the estimate of @xmath23 using this equation does not depend very much on the parabolic approximation for the band dispersion .",
    "parameter - free estimates of the fermi energy using eq.(1)@xcite show that the renormalised fermi energy in many cuprates is certainly well below @xmath24 @xmath25 and the pairing is individual .",
    "indeed such pairing will occur when the size of a pair , @xmath26 is smaller than the inter - pair separation , @xmath27 .",
    "the size of a pair is estimated as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the binding energy .",
    "separation of pairs is directly related to the fermi energy in 2d @xmath30 .",
    "we see that the true condition for real - space pairing is @xmath31    the bipolaron binding energy is thought to be twice the pseudogap .",
    "experimentally measured pseudogap of many cuprates @xcite is as large as @xmath32 so that eq.(2 ) is well satisfied in underdoped and even in a few optimally and overdoped cuprates .",
    "one should notice that the coherence length in the charged bose gas has nothing to do with the size of the boson as erroneously assumed by some athors @xcite .",
    "it depends on the interparticle distance and the mean - free path , and might be as large as in the bcs superconductor .",
    "hence , it is incorrect to apply the ratio of the coherence length to the inter - carrier distance as a criterion of the bcs - bose liquid crossover .",
    "the correct criterion is given by eq.(2 ) .",
