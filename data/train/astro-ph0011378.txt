    "* experiments and bandpowers : * anisotropies at the @xmath11 level at low multipoles revealed by cobe in 1992 were augmented at higher @xmath12 in some 19 other experiments , some with a comparable number of resolution elements to the 600 or so for cobe , most with many fewer .",
    "a list of these experiments to april 1999 with associated bandpowers is given in bond , jaffe and knox ( 2000 [ bjk00 ] ) .",
    "the anisotropy picture dramatically improved this past year , as results were announced first in summer 99 from the ground - based toco experiment in chile ( miller 2000 ) , then in november 99 from boomerang - na , the north american test flight ( mauskopf et 1999 ) .",
    "these two additions improved peak localization and gave evidence for @xmath13 .",
    "then in april 2000 , results from the first cmb long duration balloon ( ldb ) flight , were announced ( de bernardis 2000 ) , followed in may 2000 by results from the night flight of maxima ( hanany 2000 ) .",
    "boomerang s best resolution was @xmath14 , about 40 times better than that of cobe , with tens of thousands of resolution elements .",
    "maxima had a similar resolution but covered an order of magnitude less sky .",
    "1 shows the 150a ghz boomerang - ldb map and the wiener - filtered maxima-1 , to scale .",
    "the de bernardis ( 2000 ) maps at 90 and 220 ghz show the same spatial features as this 150 ghz one , with the overall intensities falling precisely on the cmb blackbody curve .",
    "the toco , boomerang and maxima experiments are described elsewhere in these proceedings .",
    "they were designed to reveal the _ primary _ anisotropies of the cmb , those which can be calculated using linear perturbation theory .",
    "1 shows the temperature power spectra for boomerang , maxima and prior - cmb data ( boomerang - na+toco+april 99 ) are in good agreement . sketching the impact of these new results on cosmic parameter estimation ( lange 2000 [ let00 ] , jaffe 2000 [ jet00 ] ) is the goal of this paper .",
    "space constraints preclude adequate referencing here , but these are given in the boomerang ( let00 ) and maxima+boomerang ( jet00 ) parameter estimation papers ( see also bond 1996 , [ b96 ] , for other references ) .",
    "we are only at the beginning of the high precision cmb era for primary anisotropies heralded by the arrival of boomerang and maxima , with interferometers taking data ( vsa , cbi , dasi ) , the single dish acbar about to , and new ldbs to fly in the next few years ( arkeops , tophat , beast / boost ) , as well as boomerang-2001 and the neo - maxima maxipol , both concentrating on polarization . in april 2001 ,",
    "nasa s hemt - based map satellite will launch , with @xmath15 resolution , and in 2007 , esa s bolometer+hemt - based planck satellite is scheduled for launch , with @xmath16 resolution .    *",
    "the cmb analysis pipeline : * analyzing boomerang and other experiments involves a pipeline that takes ( 1 ) the timestream in each of the bolometer channels coming from the balloon plus information on where it is pointing and turns it into ( 2 ) spatial maps for each frequency characterized by average temperature fluctuation values in each pixel ( fig",
    ".  1 ) and a pixel - pixel correlation matrix characterizing the noise , from which various statistical quantities are derived , in particular ( 3 ) the temperature power spectrum as a function of multipole ( fig .  1 ) , grouped into bands , and two band - band error matrices which together determine the full likelihood distribution of the bandpowers ( bond , jaffe & knox 1998 [ bjk98 ] , bjk00 ) .",
    "fundamental to the first step is the extraction of the sky signal from the noise , using the only information we have , the pointing matrix mapping a bit in time onto a pixel position on the sky . to compare the data with millions of cosmological models , as we wish to do here",
    ", the radical compression step from 2 to 3 is essential , and hinges upon an accurate representation of the likelihood surface .",
    "there is generally another step in between ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , namely separating the multifrequency spatial maps into the physical components on the sky : the primary cmb , the thermal and kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effects , the dust , synchrotron and bremsstrahlung galactic signals , the extragalactic radio and submillimetre sources .",
    "the strong agreement among the boomerang maps indicates that to first order we can ignore this step , but it has to be taken into account as the precision increases .",
    "the fig .",
    "1 map is consistent with a gaussian distribution , thus fully characterized by just the power spectrum .",
    "higher order ( concentration ) statistics ( 3,4-point functions , ) tell us of non - gaussian aspects , necessarily expected from the galactic foreground and extragalactic source signals , but possible even in the early universe fluctuations .",
    "for example , though non - gaussianity occurs only in the more baroque inflation models of quantum noise , it is a necessary outcome of defect - driven models of structure formation .",
    "( peaks compatible with fig",
    ".  1 do not appear in non - baroque defect models , which now appear unlikely . )",
    "though great strides have been made in the analysis of boomerang and maxima , there is intense needed effort worldwide now to develop new fast algorithms to deal with the looming megapixel datasets of ldbs and the satellites ( bond 1999 , szapudi 2000 ) .",
    "* parameters of structure formation : * we usually adopt the restricted set of 7 cosmological parameters used in let00 and jet00 , @xmath17 .",
    "the curvature energy is @xmath18 . the dark energy parameterized here by @xmath19 could have complex dynamics associated with it , if it is the energy density of a scalar field which dominates at late times ( now often termed a quintessence field , @xmath20 , with energy @xmath21 , steinhardt 2000 ) .",
    "one popular phenomenology is to add one more parameter , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the pressure and density of the @xmath20-field .",
    "thus @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the cosmological constant .",
    "we have also allowed @xmath9 to float .",
    "we use 2 parameters to characterize the early universe primordial power spectrum of gravitational potential fluctuations @xmath27 , one giving the overall power spectrum amplitude @xmath28 , and one defining the shape , a spectral tilt @xmath29 , both at some ( comoving ) normalization wavenumber @xmath30 .",
    "we really need another 2 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , associated with the gravitational wave component . in inflation , the amplitude ratio is related to @xmath33 to lowest order , with @xmath34 corrections at higher order , b96 .",
    "there are also useful limiting cases for the @xmath35 relation .",
    "however , as one allows the baroqueness of the inflation models to increase , one can entertain a plethora of power spectra ( with fully @xmath36-dependent @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) if one is artful enough in designing inflaton potential surfaces . as well",
    ", one can have more types of modes present , scalar isocurvature modes ( @xmath39 ) in addition to , or in place of , the scalar curvature modes ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "however , our philosophy is consider minimal models first , then see how progressive relaxation of the constraints on the inflation models , at the expense of increasing baroqueness , causes the parameter errors to open up . for example , with cobe - dmr and boomerang , we can probe the gw contribution , but the data are not powerful enough to determine much .",
    "planck can in principle probe the gravity wave contribution reasonably well .",
    "we use another 2 parameters to characterize the transport of the radiation through the era of photon decoupling , which is sensitive to the physical density of the various species of particles present then , @xmath41 .",
    "we really need 4 : @xmath42 for the baryons , @xmath43 for the cold dark matter , @xmath44 for the hot dark matter ( massive but light neutrinos ) , and @xmath45 for the relativistic particles present at that time ( photons , very light neutrinos , and possibly weakly interacting products of late time particle decays ) .",
    "for simplicity , though , we restrict ourselves to the conventional 3 species of relativistic neutrinos plus photons , with @xmath45 therefore fixed by the cmb temperature and the relationship between the neutrino and photon temperatures determined by the extra photon entropy accompanying @xmath46 annihilation . of particular importance for the pattern of the radiation",
    "is the ( comoving ) distance sound can have influenced by recombination ( at redshift @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the photon density , @xmath50 for 3 species of massless neutrinos and @xmath51 .",
    "the angular diameter distance is @xmath52 the 3 cases are for negative , zero and positive mean curvature , @xmath53 is the curvature scale and @xmath54 is the comoving distance to recombination .",
    "the location of the first acoustic peak , @xmath55 ( efstathiou and bond 1999 , hereafter eb99 ) , depends upon @xmath42 through the sound speed as well as on @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "thus @xmath59 defines a functional relationship among these parameters , a _ degeneracy _ ( eb99 ) that would be exact except for the integrated sachs - wolfe effect , associated with the change of @xmath27 with time if @xmath19 or @xmath60 is nonzero .",
    "our 7th parameter is an astrophysical one , the compton `` optical depth '' @xmath61 from a reionization redshift @xmath62 to the present .",
    "it lowers @xmath63 by @xmath64 at the high @xmath12 s probed by boomerang . for typical models of hierarchical structure formation",
    ", we expect @xmath65",
    ". it is partly degenerate with @xmath66 and can not be determined at this precision by cmb data now .",
    "the lss also depends upon our parameter set . here",
    "we use a set of ( relatively weak ) constraints on @xmath67 from cluster abundance data and on @xmath68 from galaxy clustering data ( b96 , let00 ) .",
    "@xmath69 is a bandpower for density fluctuations on a scale associated with rare clusters of galaxies , @xmath70 , which we often use in place of @xmath71 or @xmath72 for the amplitude parameter .",
    "the mass - density - power - spectrum - shape - parameter @xmath73 depends upon @xmath74 and is related to the horizon scale when the energy density in relativistic particles equals that in nonrelativistic ones .",
    "when we allow for freedom in @xmath45 , the abundance of primordial helium , tilts of tilts ( @xmath75 ) for 3 types of perturbations , the parameter count would be 17 , and many more if we open up full theoretical freedom in spectral shapes .",
    "however , as we shall see , as of now only 3 or 4 combinations can be determined with 10% accuracy with the cmb .",
    "thus choosing 7 is adequate for the present , 6 of which are discretely sampled , with generous boundaries .- database in this analysis were : ( @xmath76 0,.1,.2,.3,.4,.5,.6,.7,.8,.9,1.0,1.1 ) , ( @xmath77 .9,.7,.5,.3,.2,.15,.1,.05,0,-.05,-.1,-.15,-.2,-.3,-.5 ) , ( @xmath780 , .025 , .05 , .075 , .1 , .15 , .2 , .3 , .5 ) when @xmath79 1 , with slightly different ranges ( and @xmath3=1 ) when we allow @xmath9 to float ; ( @xmath80 .03 , .06 , .12 , .17 , .22 , .27 , .33 , .40 , .55 , .8 ) , ( @xmath81 .003125 , .00625 , .0125 , .0175 , .020 , .025 , .030 , .035 , .04 , .05 , .075 , .10 , .15 , .2 ) , ( @xmath821.5 , 1.45 , 1.4 , 1.35 , 1.3 , 1.25 , 1.2 , 1.175 , 1.15 , 1.125 , 1.1 , 1.075 , 1.05 , 1.025 , 1.0 , .975 , .95 , .925 , .9 , .875 , .85 , .825 , .8 , .775 , .75 , .725 , .7 , .65 , .6 , .55 , .5 ) , @xmath69 was continuous , and there were 4 experimental parameters for boomerang and maxima ( calibration and beam uncertainties ) , as well as other calibration parameters for some of the prior - cmb experiments .",
    "] for drawing cosmological conclusions we adopt a weak prior probability on the hubble parameter and age : we restrict @xmath83 to lie in the 0.45 to 0.9 range , and the age to be above 10 gyr .    * the first peak , @xmath3 and @xmath19 : * @xmath59 and its errors are found from the average and variance of @xmath84 , taken _ wrt _",
    "the full probability function over our database described above ( restricted for this exercise to the @xmath85 part and with the weak prior ) . as more cmb data were added , @xmath59 evolved and the errors shrunk considerably : @xmath86 for april 99 data , @xmath87 for toco+4.99 data , @xmath88 when boomerang - na was added , and @xmath89 when boomerang - ldb and maxima-1 were added to prior - cmb . the latter contrasts with @xmath90 for boomerang - ldb alone , @xmath91 for maxima-1 alone , and @xmath92 for the combination .",
    "the numbers change a bit depending upon exactly what prior one chooses or what functional forms one averages over .",
    "for the choice here , although there is a large difference in the mean between the maxima and boomerang numbers , it is not unreasonable within the errors .",
    "other ways of doing this make the discrepancy seem more statistically significant ( page 2000 , these proceedings ) .    in fig .  2",
    ", we show the lines of constant @xmath93 in the @xmath3@xmath19 plane , for given @xmath58 and @xmath42 , using the formulas given above and discussed in more detail in eb99 .",
    "the @xmath94 band around 210 corresponds to our best @xmath59 estimate of @xmath95 using all current cmb data .",
    "note that the constant @xmath59 lines look rather similar to the contours shown in the right panel , showing that the @xmath96 degeneracy plays a large role in determining the contours .",
    "the contours hug the @xmath97 line more closely than the allowed @xmath59 band does for the maximum probability values of @xmath58 and @xmath42 , because of the shift in the allowed @xmath59 band as @xmath58 and @xmath42 vary in this plane .",
    "see also bond ( 2001b , [ capp2k ] ) for @xmath59 plots in the quintessence plane , @xmath9-@xmath21 , which demonstrate why @xmath9 is poorly determined by cmb alone .",
    ".cosmological parameter values and their 1-sigma errors are shown , determined after marginalizing over the other @xmath98 cosmological and @xmath99 experimental parameters , for b98+maxima - i+prior - cmb and the weak prior , @xmath100 , age @xmath101 gyr .",
    "the lss prior was also designed to be weak . in the first set @xmath3 varies , in the second set",
    "it is fixed to unity .",
    "similar tables for b98+dmr are given in let00 and for b98+maxima - i+dmr in jet00 .",
    "we have set the quintessence @xmath102 parameter to @xmath10 , the cosmological constant case , but the last line shows the limit on @xmath9 if we allow it to vary ( the other parameters do not move much ) .",
    "sn1 results on @xmath9 with earlier cmb data were given in perlmutter ( 1999 ) .",
    "the detections in the table are clearly very stable if extra `` prior '' probabilities for lss and sn1 are included , and are also stable with much stronger priors on @xmath103 , but do move if the bbn - derived @xmath104 prior is imposed . if @xmath3 is varied , parameters derived from our basic 7 come out to be : age=@xmath105 gyr , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",

    "table  1 shows there are strong detections with only the cmb data for @xmath3 , @xmath42 and @xmath113 in the minimal inflation - based 7 parameter set , and a reasonable detection of @xmath43 .",
    "the ranges quoted are bayesian 50% values and the errors are 1-sigma , obtained after projecting ( marginalizing ) over all other parameters . that @xmath19 is not well determined is a manifestation of the @xmath3@xmath19 near - degeneracy discussed above , which is broken when",

    "@xmath42 really focussed in with boomerang - ldb and maxima-1 , as did @xmath19 .",

    "the cmb data by itself will not be able to strongly discriminate this ratio .",
    "adding hdm does have a strong impact on the cmb - normalized @xmath66 and the shape of the density power spectrum ( effective @xmath73 parameter ) , both of which mean that when lss is included , adding some hdm to cdm is strongly preferred in the absence of @xmath19 .",
    "however , though higher @xmath120 is preferred at the expense of less dark energy , significant @xmath19 is still required ( see @xmath1192k for the evolution of the cmb+lss 2-sigma contours in the @xmath121@xmath19 plane as @xmath118 is varied ) .",

    "the future , forecasts for parameter eigenmodes : * we can also forecast dramatically improved precision with further analysis of boomerang and maxima , future ldbs , map and planck . because there are correlations among the physical variables we wish to determine , including a number of near - degeneracies beyond that for @xmath3@xmath19 ( eb99 ) , it is useful to disentangle them , by making combinations which diagonalize the error correlation matrix , `` parameter eigenmodes '' ( b96 , eb99 ) . for this exercise , we will add @xmath44 and @xmath33 to our parameter mix , but set @xmath9=@xmath10 , making 9 .",
    "( the ratio @xmath122 is treated as fixed by @xmath33 , a reasonably accurate inflation theory result . )",
    "the forecast for boomerang+dmr based on the 440 square degree patch with a single 150 ghz bolometer used in the published data is 3 out of 9 linear combinations should be determined to @xmath123 accuracy .",
    "this is indeed what we get in the full analysis of let00 for cmb only .",
    "if 4 of the 6 150 ghz channels are used and the region is doubled in size , we predict 4/9 could be determined to @xmath123 accuracy .",
    "the boomerang team is still working on the data to realize this promise . and if the optimistic case for all the proposed ldbs is assumed , 6/9 parameter combinations could be determined to @xmath123 accuracy , 2/9 to @xmath124 accuracy .",
    "the situation improves for the satellite experiments : for map , we forecast 6/9 combos to @xmath123 accuracy , 3/9 to @xmath124 accuracy ; for planck , 7/9 to @xmath125 accuracy , 5/9 to @xmath124 accuracy . while we can expect systematic errors to loom as the real arbiter of accuracy , the clear forecast is for a very rosy decade of high precision cmb cosmology that we are now fully into .",
