    "the determination of an accurate value for the internal extinction in galaxies is of relevance both in the understanding of their structure and in applications such as the determination of redshift independent distances .",
    "edge - on spirals are used preferentially in studies that apply the luminosity - linewidth relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) and these are , of course , the galaxies in which extinction effects will be the largest .",
    "inadequate corrections for extinction will produce systematic distance errors in our catalogs .",
    "recent discussions of this issue can be found in @xcite and @xcite , while a comprehensive history of the study of internal extinction in galaxies can be found in the introduction of @xcite .",
    "analyses similar to the ones carried out in this paper can be found in giovanelli _",
    "et al . _  ( 1994 ; hereafter g94 , and 1995 ) and @xcite .",
    "since there is intrinsic variability in the properties of galaxies , the determination of the amount of extinction is most readily obtained in a statistical way , in which case large samples are desirable . however , sample selection effects need to be well understood in order to avoid interpreting spurious effects as astrophysically significant . there will be further discussion of the effects of such biases on the results of this paper in sections 5.3 and 6.2",
    ".    in this paper we report on statistical tests which search for the effects of extinction in spiral galaxies in the near infra - red ( nir ) bands , i ( 0.81 @xmath0 m ) , j ( 1.25 @xmath0 m ) , h ( 1.65 @xmath0 m ) and k@xmath3 ( 2.17 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "nir bands are often used in cases where accurate total magnitudes of galaxies are needed , as they clearly minimize , if not eliminate , the need for extinction corrections . for this reason it is particularly interesting to search for the effects of extinction in these bands .",
    "samples and available data are described in sections 2 and 3 . in section 4",
    "we apply simple tests for reddening with inclination and in sections 5 and 6 we discuss in more detail the effects of extinction on the isophotal radius and total magnitudes respectively .",
    "a simple photometric model for the extinction is discussed in section 7 and in section 8 luminosity dependences are discussed .",
    "a summary of the conclusions is given in section 9 .",
    "the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) completed its coverage of the near infra - red sky in february 2001 .",
    "data were taken in three nir bands , j , h and k@xmath3 using two identical 1.3 m telescopes , one in arizona , the other in chile . with an extended source sensitivity of 14.8 , 14.0 and 13.4 mag at j , h and k@xmath3  @xcite and an angular resolution of about 2 - 3 arcseconds ,",
    "2mass has detected more than 1.65 million galaxies @xcite ; the resultant data are available in the extended source catalog ( xsc ) .",
    "two samples were extracted from the 2mass all - sky release xsc . for statistical studies",
    "the samples should be as large as possible , but it is also important for them to have well defined selection criteria .",
    "the first sample ( and by far the largest ) consists of all galaxies with well defined spiral morphology and known redshift taken from the arecibo general catalog ( a private compilation by the authors known as the agc ) .",
    "nearby , peculiar motions contribute significantly to observed recessional velocities so we further limit the agc to @xmath4 km  s@xmath5  in order to use the redshift as a reliable distance indicator .",
    "this large sample is referred to as the agc@xmath6 .",
    "the agc is an all - sky compilation , but has varying completeness functions in different areas of the sky . a second ,",
    "smaller sample consists of galaxies in the agc@xmath6 for which i - band photometry is also available ( as will be described below ) .",
    "this sample we call the sfi2 as it contains all of the sfi data @xcite plus similar but newer and as yet unpublished additions to that .",
    "this sample is a homogeneous all - sky sample of mostly sc galaxies . in summary :    agc@xmath6 : :    spiral galaxies of known redshift from the arecibo general catalog .",
    "the redshift was further confined to @xmath7 3000    km  s@xmath5 .",
    "this sample includes a total of 15244    galaxies .",
    "sfi2 : :    galaxies from agc@xmath6 which also have i - band photometry    available .",
    "this sample has a total of 3035 galaxies , which are mostly    of types sc and sbc .",
    "the detection fractions of these galaxies in the 2mass xsc ( within 12  of the previously cataloged position ) are 80% for the agc@xmath6 and 85% for the sfi2 sample .",
    "we expect that this is due in part to the detection limits of the 2mass survey and in part to the accuracy of the currently tabulated positions of the galaxies in the agc . in support of this assumption",
    "the detection fraction increases for the sfi2 galaxies that are expected to have more accurate positions in the agc . for the second incremental release of 2mass data ,",
    "a discussion of completeness is included in the on - line explanatory supplement . when the search for a match is extended to a radius of 0.5  of known galaxies from the zwicky catalog ,",
    "the detection rate is 95% . in the nir , surface brightness decreases towards later type galaxies @xcite making late type , gas rich galaxies ( like the sc galaxies which make up the bulk of the sfi2 sample ) harder to detect than e / s0/sa galaxies",
    "for all of the galaxies in our samples various data are available .",
    "these included redshifts , coarse blue magnitudes and angular sizes from the agc , photometry from 2mass and i - band photometry for the sfi2 sample . in the computation of absolute magnitudes a value of h@xmath8 km",
    "s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 is adopted .",
    "the i - band photometry available for the sfi2 sample is described in @xcite .",
    "quantities of particular interest are :    @xmath9 : :    - i - band axial ratio derived from a fit of elliptical surface    brightness contours to the i - band images .",
    "the average error in    @xmath10 is 0.03 .",
    "@xmath11 : :    - radius measured at the i - band isophote of 23.5    magarcsec@xmath1 .",
    "@xmath12 : :    - total i - band magnitude . calculated from an extrapolation of a fit to    the disk to 8 scale lengths of the disk .",
    "typical total errors are in    the range 0.03 - 0.06 mag . @xmath13 : :    - scale length of the disk derived from a fit to the one - dimensional    i - band photometric profile .",
    "the photometric quantities in the xsc are derived by inspecting the 2mass images with the extended source processor ( galworks ) , which was developed for this purpose ( see jarrett _ et al . _  2000 ) . by the time the 2mass images get to galworks a point source spread function",
    "has already been derived for each image .",
    "galworks identifies extended sources ( galaxies as well as other more nearby resolved sources ) and measures a variety of parameters for each one as described in @xcite and in the 2mass explanatory supplement @xcite .",
    "very large galaxies ( greater than 5  in size at @xmath14th magarcsec@xmath1  in j - band ) are first identified in in a separate large galaxy atlas and then added to the xsc .",
    "the quantities from the xsc that we use are :    @xmath15 : :    - j - band axial ratio fit to the 3@xmath16 isophote ( which    is close to the 20th magarcsec@xmath1 isophote ) .",
    "the    center of this ellipse fit is fixed to the peak intensity pixel and    since only one isophote is fitted , it is an approximation to the    ellipticity of the galaxy .",
    "if the 3@xmath16 isophote is    too close to the center of the galaxy the bulge might interfere with    the derived ellipticity , making the galaxy appear more face - on than it    really is . of the three 2mass bands , the j axial ratio should suffer    the least from this effect ; we note that no systematic offset is seen    between the j - band and i - band axial ratios , as can be seen figure    [ avcol]d .",
    "an estimate of the average error of 0.1 in    @xmath10 is derived from the scatter in this plot ; this    is more than three times as large as the average error estimated for    the equivalent i - band quantity .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 : :    - semi - major axis of the isophotal elliptical aperture set to the 21st    magarcsec@xmath1 isophote individually in each band .",
    "an    alternative to this would have been the semi - major axis of the ellipse    fit to the 20th magarcsec@xmath1  isophote , which is the    preferred aperture in the xsc @xcite . in section 5.1",
    "it is shown that    @xmath20  in j - band is at @xmath21 scale    lengths of the disk ( @xmath13 ) , while in h and    k@xmath3  it is @xmath22 . a similar    analysis for @xmath23 shows that    @xmath24 , and    r@xmath25 .",
    "we choose to use    @xmath20  in order to trace the disks as far out as    possible ( which still is not far compared to    @xmath26 ) .",
    "since the typical 1    @xmath16 background noise is 21.4 , 20.6 and 20.0 mag in j ,    h and k@xmath3  respectively @xcite , we must be careful    in using the radii set to the 21st magarcsec@xmath1  level ,    especially in h and k@xmath3 . in j - band    @xmath20",
    "should be reasonably well defined , and does    indeed show good correlation with @xmath23 with a scatter    of about 3 .",
    "the same analysis for h and k@xmath3  shows    a similar correlation with a slightly larger scatter ( 3.5  and 4     respectively ) .",
    "when @xmath27 is smaller than 7  or greater than    120  ( for either isophote and in all bands ) it does not follow the    correlation well . these radii are not used .",
    "j@xmath28 , h@xmath28 , k@xmath28 : :    - magnitudes within the 21st magarcsec@xmath1  elliptical    isophote set in j - band ( referred to as `` j fiducial '' are used to    construct colors because of the necessity of having a consistent    aperture .",
    "the uncertainty on these magnitudes listed in the xsc is    that associated with poisson noise and background subtraction and does    not include other errors such as the zero point calibration and the    uncertainty in the elliptical isophotal aperture ( see jarrett et al .",
    "2000 for more details ) .",
    "this formal uncertainty is small ( with the    largest quoted at only 0.2 mag ) and the real uncertainty is likely to    be larger .",
    "the `` level one science requirements '' of 2mass ( which can    be found in the on - line explanatory supplement ) require that the    extended source photometry be accurate and uniform to within 10% , and    we assume this is a closer estimate of the error in the magnitudes .",
    "j@xmath28 , h@xmath28 , k@xmath28 : :    - magnitudes measured within the 21st    magarcsec@xmath1  level set in j - band are used to construct    colors .",
    "j@xmath29 , h@xmath29 , k@xmath29 : :    - xsc `` extrapolated '' magnitudes designed to represent the total    magnitude of the galaxy .",
    "these magnitudes are derived from an    extrapolation of the radial surface brightness profile from the 20th    magarcsec@xmath1  elliptical isophote down to    @xmath30 which is set to 5 times the scale length    from the j - band fit .",
    "see @xcite for more details .      in order to use the photometry from the 2mass xsc to its best potential for our purposes , various corrections for seeing ,",
    "galactic extinction and cosmological redshift need to be applied .",
    "these corrections have already been applied to the i - band quantities in a similar manner as that described below ( for details , see haynes _",
    "_  1999a ) .",
    "figure [ seeing]a shows a plot of @xmath31 vs. the 20th magarcsec@xmath1  isophotal radius ( the approximate isophotal radius at which @xmath32 is reported ) .",
    "we see that there is a lack of galaxies with both high axial ratio and small size .",
    "this is due mainly to the resolution of the images set by the seeing and the pixel size .    in the xsc , seeing is characterized using a modified exponential of the form @xmath33\\ ] ] fit to many stars in each frame , where @xmath34 is the central surface brightness , @xmath27 is the radius in arcseconds and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are free parameters .",
    "the `` radial shape '' ( @xmath37 ) is reported , and an approximate relation is given in the 2mass seeing and image statistics to recover the full width at half maximum of the point spread function ; @xmath38 the mean value of this fwhm is about 2.5  for the galaxies in our samples ( the 2mass raw images have a pixel size of 2  which sets the lower limit on the resolution ) , and the spread is small .",
    "we derive a correction by numerically convolving exponential disks of varying inclination and angular sizes with a gaussian of fwhm = 2.5 .",
    "axial ratios are measured at a radial distance from the galaxy center of @xmath39 ( where @xmath13 refers to the scale length of the exponential disk ) , corresponding to @xmath23 in j - band ( the ratio @xmath40 is obtained in the same way as @xmath41 in section 5.1 ) .",
    "the derived correction is parameterized as @xmath42 with @xmath43 ( where fwhm = 2.5  is used in all cases and @xmath23 is measured in arcseconds in the j - band image ) .",
    "hereafter , when we refer to the j - band axial ratio , we refer to the quantity corrected by the above equation .",
    "the result of the correction can be seen in figure [ seeing]b . in a few cases where the galaxy is very small and highly inclined",
    "the correction is large so to avoid over - correcting a maximum value of @xmath44 is imposed and these galaxies are assumed to have an inclination of 90 . from figure 1b",
    "it appears that the correction removes much but perhaps not all of the bias , so very small galaxies may appear less inclined than they really are .",
    "it should also be noted that the derived correction assumes light profiles are exponential , which may not be an ideal approximation within the @xmath45 radius in j - band where the contribution from a bulge may be significant .",
    "magnitudes are corrected for galactic ( _ i.e. _  originating within the milky way ) extinction using the dirbe galactic extinction maps ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) .",
    "the column densities listed in the map are converted to extinction in the relevant bands by @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "a small cosmological k - correction is also included using a simple linear fit to the low redshift end of the models of @xcite which is @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the magnitude in band x corrected for galactic extinction and cosmological k - correction is then @xmath52    the isophotal radii also need to be corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "if we assume the disk photometric profiles are exponential with scale length @xmath13 in band x , then @xmath53 ( since the surface brightness at radius @xmath27 in an exponential disk is given by @xmath54 ) .",
    "we also correct sizes for a cosmological stretch factor @xmath55 .",
    "in this section we use the samples defined above in section 2 to investigate the effects of internal extinction in the disks by investigating color gradients with inclination .",
    "this test has the advantage of suffering little from selection effects . for the sfi2 sample , we use the i - band axial ratios as the measure of inclination since these have errors almost three times smaller than the equivalent j - band measure from the xsc .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ colour - inc ] in which colors ( measured within an elliptical aperture with a semi - major axis of @xmath20  in j - band ) are plotted vs. axial ratio .",
    "it is clear that reddening is present in all colors , which sets a lower limit to the extinction in the j and h bands by assuming that the extinction in k@xmath3 is negligible .",
    "following g94 and others , we parameterize the internal extinction as @xmath56 the lower limit on @xmath57 is then 0.3 mag in j and 0.1 mag in h. the formal error in fitting this slope to the data is 0.01 mag in both cases , while the scatter in the relationship is 0.1 mag .",
    "if there is extinction present in k@xmath3-band ( _ i.e. _  @xmath58 ) , the actual values of @xmath57 in j and h will be @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "an indication that the linear law of eqn 7 may not be appropriate for the highest inclinations is apparent in panels ( a ) and ( c ) of figure 2 , an issue we ll revisit below and in section 6 .    for the sfi2 sample , i - band magnitudes are also available .",
    "these magnitudes can be used to construct i - j , i - h and i - k@xmath3 colors , with the understanding that the apertures are not consistent between i and the other bands .",
    "this mismatch should not , in the first order , affect the slope of the reddening , just the absolute color .",
    "the results of this are shown in figure [ icol ] . under the assumption that the extinction in k@xmath3 is negligible",
    ", we derive a lower limit on the extinction in i - band of @xmath61 mag ( where the error is the formal error in determining the slope ) .",
    "g94 find an extinction law of @xmath62 , while @xcite derive @xmath63 , suggesting that if the extinction in k@xmath3 is not equal to zero , it is likely to be small .    for the much larger agc@xmath6 sample of galaxies ( which does not have i - band photometry for all the galaxies ) , we can plot the j - h , j - k@xmath3 and h - k@xmath3 colors against the j - band axial ratios ( figure [ avcol ] ) .",
    "since the sample is large , we combine the points into averages in @xmath10 bins which makes the inadequacy of a simple linear law for the relationship ( as noted in figure [ colour - inc ] ) stand out .",
    "we fit two separate lines respectively for @xmath10 less than and greater than 0.5 , and also include a quadratic fit for comparison .",
    "the parameterization of @xmath64 with a linear law in eqn 7 is an expedient form , and internal extinction can well depart from such a linear law , depending on the details of the relative distribution of stars and dust ( see , e.g. evans 1992 and g94 ) . in most simulations , in fact ,",
    "@xmath64 steepens with increasing @xmath10 as will be shown for a simple photometric model in section [ model ] .",
    "our adoption of bi - linear and quadratic fits reflects a least departure from simple expediency .",
    "the location of the break in the bi - linear law at @xmath65 for all color trends is also practical but arbitrary .",
    "the slopes of the bi - linear relation are 0.10 @xmath66 0.02 and 0.31 @xmath66 0.05 for j - h , 0.05 @xmath66 0.02 and 0.15 @xmath66 0.05 for h - k@xmath3 , and 0.15 @xmath66 0.02 and 0.46 @xmath66 0.05 for j - k@xmath3 .",

    "if a galaxy is completely opaque within a given isophotal radius in the face - on perspective then no change in the measured radius is expected with inclination . if it is assumed that the face - on disk is transparent at that radius , then the isophotal radius should increase as the disk is tilted and we look through a longer path length . the expected change derived for the simple case of a pure exponential disk is @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are respectively the isophotal radius and the disk scale length in the face - on case .",
    "if we assume that the scale length changes with inclination like @xmath71 ( which is justified by the observation that the ratio @xmath41 does not change with inclination , as seen below ) then we derive @xmath72    we have the scale lengths in i - band measured for the sfi2 sample and make the assumption that scale lengths do not change significantly between i , j , h and k@xmath3-band , as found by @xcite from a sample of 86 face - on spiral galaxies . in their sample , scale length is seen to decrease as the wavelength increases , but not significantly between i and k. a measure of the scale length is provided in the xsc for all of the galaxies in our sample , but given the notorious difficulties with fitting scale lengths , we choose not to use that automated measure here , and only use scale lengths from the sfi2 sample fit `` by hand '' ( see @xcite for more details on the sfi2 scale lengths ) . using these scale lengths we estimate @xmath73 and @xmath74 in j , h and k@xmath3 for the sfi2 galaxies ( where the error here is the scatter in the sample ) , and we assume that these ratios hold for all the galaxies in the agc@xmath6 sample .",
    "the ratio @xmath41 in k@xmath3 may be slightly smaller than in h , but this is within the errors .",
    "no significant dependence of the ratio on inclination is observed in any band .",
    "we note that the @xmath41 ratios imply that @xmath75 is at only @xmath76 scale lengths out in the disk , while in h and k@xmath3 , @xmath20 is still at only @xmath77 scale lengths .",
    "the commonly reported isophotal radius at i - band is @xmath11 at 3.5 - 4 scale lengths which is further out than @xmath17 .",
    "if the face - on disks were transparent at @xmath78 we can rewrite eqn [ delta ] as @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 in j , h and k@xmath3 respectively , when we use the @xmath41 values given above .",
    "the isophotal radius does not change ( @xmath82 ) if the disk is opaque at @xmath20 so @xmath83 must decrease as the disk becomes less transparent .",
    "the main limitation on eqn [ delta ] is that it assumes that the photometric profile is exponential , while it is expected that the importance of the bulge light increases in these nir bands .",
    "here we test the often made assumption that the outer disks of galaxies are transparent , especially in the nir .",
    "suppose that stars and dust are exponentially distributed with scale lengths @xmath84 .",
    "the disk opacity at radius @xmath27 and inclination @xmath85 is then @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the opacity at @xmath88 in the face - on perspective .",
    "there have been many attempts to derive @xmath87 for spiral galaxies . g94",
    "derive an upper limit in i - band of @xmath89 using statistical arguments with a sample of about 2000 sc galaxies .",
    "a lower estimate of @xmath87 was obtained by @xcite : they claim that @xmath90 in 7 edge - on spiral galaxies they model in k , j , i , v and b - bands .",
    "@xcite derive values of @xmath87 using bvrijhk photometry and radiative transfer models for 15 spiral galaxies .",
    "they adopt values in the ranges of 0.15 - 0.6 , 0.1 - 0.4 , and 0.05 - 0.2 for j , h and k respectively .",
    "@xcite find @xmath910.3 - 0.5 in h - band from a sample of 154 galaxies .",
    "even if @xmath92 were as high as @xmath93 it is easy to see that at @xmath94 the disk is close to transparent out to quite high inclinations .",
    "however it has been shown above that @xmath20 in j , h and k@xmath3 is closer to the center of the disk than @xmath95 so ( in the above model ) even for relatively low values of @xmath87 the opacity could become significant in a highly inclined disk .",
    "figure [ tau ] shows the inclination at which the galaxy becomes optically thick ( @xmath96 ) plotted as a function of the radial distance for @xmath87 varying between 0.25 and 10 .",
    "at @xmath20 in j - band , which is @xmath76 @xmath13 , the disk can become opaque before it is fully inclined for even the smaller @xmath87 .",
    "if we interpret the change of slope for high inclinations shown in figures [ avcol ] and [ holmjh]a as the onset of @xmath97 at @xmath20 , a `` break '' for j - band ( @xmath98 ) and h and k@xmath3  ( @xmath99 ) near @xmath100 would suggest that the disk opacity in the j , h and k@xmath3  bands , while low , is non - negligible and that even at @xmath20  an important fraction of the light is extincted when disks are edge - on .",
    "recent studies suggest that the dust scale length is larger than that of the stars , see for example @xcite who use @xmath101 with @xmath102 . in the above model this simply changes the position of @xmath20with respect to the dust scale length so that for example @xmath103 . in that case a lower central face - on opacity is required to explain the behavior .",
    "it is possible to test the mean change in isophotal radius with inclination in a statistical way using large samples of galaxies . for",
    "the test described below , the biases introduced by the selection function of the sample can be quite severe . in order to keep track of these effects , we use only galaxies north of declination @xmath104  from the agc@xmath6 , since that region is known to be more homogeneously and completely sampled in the catalog .",
    "most of the galaxies in the agc were originally identified by eye from photographic plates on which small , dim galaxies are easier to pick out if they are edge - on . in an attempt to remove this bias",
    "we also restrict the sample to b @xmath105 15.5 .",
    "the samples are then further reduced to be flux limited ( using @xmath106 from the xsc ) or angular size limited ( using @xmath20 ) within each band .",
    "the final 6 subsamples are taken to represent complete flux or angular size limited samples , and are summarized in table [ subsamples ] .",

    "the mean of @xmath20 is then computed in bins of @xmath114 .",
    "these bins all have an equal number of galaxies in them ( @xmath11530 - 60 depending on the size of the subgroup ) .",
    "since there are few galaxies at high inclinations this restricts analysis of subgroups to @xmath116 0.7 - 0.8 in most cases . in each of the bins the values of @xmath117 are scaled by the mean of the value for the whole distance group ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "a relation @xmath119 is fit to the points and the value of @xmath83 ( see eqn 10 ) is calculated as @xmath120 .",
    "the results in k@xmath3-band for both the size and flux - limited sub - samples are shown in figure [ avtest_r ] , and are summarized for each band in table [ radiusaverage ] along with the values of @xmath83 derived in section 5.1 for the case of an exponential disk which is transparent at @xmath20 .",
    "a comparison of panels 6a and 6b , constructed from flux and angular size - limited samples respectively , well illustrates the amplitude of the bias introduced by the character of the sample .",

    "as a result , this sample will exhibit a shallow @xmath122 v. @xmath10 slope as shown by figure 6b .",
    "alternatively , in a magnitude limited sample , intrinsically larger galaxies fall below the threshold magnitude if they are edge - on due to the dimming caused by extinction .",
