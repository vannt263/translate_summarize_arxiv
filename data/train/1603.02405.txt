    "from the end of their lifetime on the main sequence to their death as white dwarfs , most stars evolve from a perfectly spherically symmetric morphology to the often very irregular shapes of planetary nebulae dissolving into the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the transition , with red giant and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) as main intermediate states , is the object of intense study .",
    "the first departure from spherical symmetry is often observed to be the appearance of a bipolar outflow , axisymmetry  meaning invariance by rotation ( rather than symmetry ) about an axis  replacing spherical symmetry .",
    "many observations , whether of the dust from infrared , mid - infrared and far - infrared or of the gas from atomic radio or molecular millimetre / sub - millimetre emission , in particular from carbon monoxide , are interpreted in terms of such symmetry",
    ". namely they aim at giving a model of the circumstellar envelope ( cse ) displaying invariance with respect to rotation about a well - defined star axis , averaging over deviations from it , assumed to be small .",
    "the physics mechanisms at play in such symmetry breaking are not well understood and many observations aim at their clarification .",
    "the presence of a companion accreting gas from the dying star is very often invoked , but the roles of rotation and of magnetic field  how the angular momentum and magnetic flux of the original star are distributed between the degenerate core and the cse  are still unclear .    the study of protostars displays striking similarities with the study of evolved stars .",
    "the cse is now in - falling rather than expanding but axisymmetry is again found to be a good working approximation in many cases and the mechanisms that govern the transition from gravitational in - fall to formation of a rotating disk , accretion by the protostar and emission of a bipolar outflow are still partly unclear .    in the present article , we focus on the millimetre / sub - millimetre observation of the expanding cse of agb stars , typically from carbon monoxide emission , but many developments apply as well to the in - falling cses of protostars .",
    "the data are in the form of flux densities @xmath0 , measured in jansky / beam in bins ( pixels ) of sky coordinates ( @xmath1 to the east and @xmath2 to the north ) and of frequency , the latter being expressed in terms of the doppler velocity @xmath3 measured along the line of sight taken as @xmath4 axis . making a model of the cse from such observations can be conceptually separated in two steps , even if , in practice , they are generally mixed : the reconstruction in space of the gas properties , a purely mathematical problem , and the conception of a physical model accounting for the distribution in space of the gas density , temperature and velocity .",
    "the former , the mathematical problem , is what is addressed here .",
    "it aims at measuring , at each point of space coordinates @xmath5 , the temperature @xmath6 , density @xmath7 and velocity vector @xmath8 of the gas .",
    "this means , for each @xmath9 pixel , to calculate the values taken by @xmath6 , @xmath7 and the three velocity components as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "while the assumption of rotational invariance about the star axis brings a helpful constraint , the problem is obviously unsolvable without making additional hypotheses ( six unknowns in each pixel , @xmath4 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and the components of the velocity vector , for only two input data : the measured flux density @xmath10 and the doppler velocity @xmath3 ) . from the beginning ,",
    "we simplify the density and temperature side of the problem by introducing an effective emissivity @xmath11 ( in earlier publications we called it effective density , which is improper ) , defined as @xmath12 implying @xmath13    the effective emissivity is therefore a function of the gas density , the abundance of the emitting gas , the population of the emitting quantum state and the probabilities of emission and absorption of the detected radiation .",
    "it is equal to the volume emissivity in the optically thin limit .",
    "in general , we measure all distances as angular distances , including along the line of sight : an angular distance of 1@xmath14 means a distance of 1 au times the distance of the star from the earth measured in parsec , the effective emissivity being measured in jykms@xmath15arcsec@xmath16 . also from the beginning",
    ", we often restrict our considerations to centrally symmetric star morphologies and kinematics , implying @xmath17 .",
    "the problem of reconstructing cse properties in space from radio observations is not new and has been addressed for decades by radio astronomers .",
    "what is new , however , is the availability of observations of unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution in the millimetre and sub - millimetre ranges , with the recent operation of the alma interferometer .",
    "it opens a new era in millimetre and sub - millimetre radio astronomy and requires analysis methods that make the best of the excellent quality of the data that it provides , namely allowing for more quantitative conclusions to be reliably drawn from observations than was previously possible .",
    "indeed , the sensitivity and spatial resolution that could be reached before alma were such that one had often to be satisfied with qualitative statements obtained from the visual inspection of channel maps , spectral maps and position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams .",
    "in particular , the reliability and uniqueness of the proposed models could rarely be quantitatively discussed .",
    "the general problem of reconstructing ( one says `` deprojecting '' ) a 3-d image from its 2-d projection is a topic of broad interest and the subject of abundant literature ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "it has been addressed with particular attention in the domain of optical astronomy , often with emphasis on providing tools that can be used , interactively if possible , by a broad community of people having little expertise in programming , not only for research applications but also for educational purposes , planetarium simulations , etc ... an archetype of such 3-d modelling tool is the shape software of @xcite which makes optimal use of state of the art knowledge in computer visualisation and obtains excellent results in terms of accuracy and computer time .    as the problem is obviously underdetermined ( it boils down to solving integral equation 2 ) additional hypotheses need to be made .",
    "axisymmetry is the most common ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* @xcite @xcite & @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", deprojection is relatively straightforward once the orientation of the symmetry axis in space is known .",
    "but , while the projection of the symmetry axis on the sky plane is directly revealed , its inclination with respect to the line of sight is more hidden and its evaluation requires algorithms such as chi square minimization and/or iterative approximations and may result in significant uncertainties .",
    "an interesting approach has been explored by @xcite in the case of the circumstellar dust of planetary nebulae illuminated by the central star .",
    "they do not assume any symmetry but make use of the properties of the scattered light to obtain a plausible approximation of the dust distribution .",
    "most of the literature , however , concentrates on the morphology deprojection without considering the kinematic deprojection .",
    "morphology deprojection is from 2-d on the sky plane to 3-d in space .",
    "kinematic deprojection implies , in addition , going from the 1-d doppler velocity to the 3-d space velocity , or , equivalently , from the 3-d datacube ( 2-d on the sky plane + 1-d for the doppler velocity ) to the 6-d phase space ( 3-d for space coordinates and 3-d for velocity coordinates ) .",
    "kinematic deprojection is therefore even more underdetermined than morphology deprojection .",
    "a notable exception is from @xcite and @xcite who evaluate the velocity field under the assumption of radial expansion .",
    "the shape software also allows for including kinematic considerations but the accent is on morphology more than on kinematics : it inherits from optical observations , where the measurement of velocities is difficult , requiring methods such as long - slit spectroscopy , while in radio astronomy the full velocity spectrum is directly available in each pixel . yet",
    ", the flexibility of the code makes it possible to produce simulations including arbitrary velocity fields , such as was done recently by @xcite using alma data .    in comparison with the existing literature , the present paper displays both similarities and differences .",
    "the similarities are very general and include the type of problems one is facing , the considerations that they inspire and the analysis of how they should be approached .",
    "the differences result in part from the restriction of our work to the case of evolved stars and protostars observed in millimetre and sub - millimetre astronomy . in this domain ,",
    "the information carried by kinematics is usually richer than that carried by morphology .",
    "this is due both to the power of the instrument in providing simply accurate velocity spectra and in the physics of evolved stars , with a morphology departing rather late from spherical while important winds can be already revealed in an early phase of their evolution .",
    "much of the existing literature on optical deprojection addresses the case of planetary nebulae , with morphologies of often extreme complexity .",
    "this is not the case for evolved stars ; even in the case of mira , on which we briefly comment , one can describe the sources in terms of simpler objects that can be studied separately .",
    "moreover , while lumpiness is frequently observed in agb cses , it is less of a problem than in the case of planetary nebulae and axisymmetry usually remains a good approximation ( we address this issue in section  [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "much of the existing literature on optical deprojection devotes particular attention to producing user - friendly algorithms with emphasis on computer time and interactivity .",
    "we do not have such ambition .",
    "our motivation is simply to address issues of data analysis in general , and deprojection in particular , in the context of radio astronomy of evolved stars , where much of the current literature is limited to displaying channel and spectral maps .",
    "we also mean to show that much information can be obtained by constructing simple variables and simple histograms that do not require complex analysis tools .",
    "more generally , the paper is written in the spirit of encouraging more quantitative analyses than commonly found in analyses of radio observations of evolved stars using instruments that do not have as good sensitivity and resolution as alma is now offering .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] , we explore the more important features of the problem of deprojection using simulated observations ; in section  [ sec3 ] , we apply the information obtained in the first part to a few actual stars ; section  [ sec4 ] summarizes the two preceding sections and makes some statements aimed at helping and guiding future analyses of millimetre / sub - millimetre observations of the cses of axisymmetric radio sources .    for an easier reading ,",
    "we have collected in an appendix many developments , which , although important for an in - depth understanding , are not essential for grasping the main message .",
    "we define ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) two orthonormal coordinate systems , @xmath5 and @xmath18 ; @xmath5 with @xmath4 along the line of sight ( positive away from the observer ) , @xmath1 pointing east and @xmath2 pointing north ; @xmath18 with @xmath19 along the star axis obtained from @xmath5 by a first rotation of angle @xmath20 about @xmath4 and a second rotation of angle @xmath21 about @xmath22 , the transformed of @xmath1 in the first rotation .",
    "transformation relations between the two systems are spelled out in appendix  [ seca1 ] .",
    "we also use polar coordinates @xmath23 in the plane of the sky : @xmath24 and we define @xmath25      the flux densities , @xmath10 or @xmath26 , available to analysis are three - dimensional objects , which makes their visualization difficult .",
    "traditionally , one uses channel - maps ( @xmath2 vs @xmath1 distributions in each @xmath3 bin or group of neighbour bins ) or spectral maps ( @xmath3 distributions in each pixel or group of neighbour pixels ) . however , when the number of velocity bins and of pixels is large , it becomes increasingly difficult to obtain useful information by direct inspection of an increasingly large number of maps .",
    "it is therefore convenient to reduce the problem to two dimensions by introducing moments of order @xmath27 obtained by integrating the measured flux densities over one of the variables after having multiplied them by that variable raised to power @xmath27 . in practice ,",
    "only a few of these moments are commonly used , usually under other names . integrating over @xmath3 maps the flux @xmath28 as @xmath29 decreases usually rapidly with @xmath30 , typically as @xmath31 , mapping the quantity @xmath32 is better suited for revealing finer details of the flux map . the first order moment divided by the integrated flux @xmath33",
    "gives the mean doppler velocity in each pixel , which is a useful indicator of a possible asymmetry of the wind velocities .",
    "similarly , @xmath34 and @xmath35 provide useful information .    fixing a sky coordinate , @xmath1 or @xmath2 , or integrating over it corresponds to the p - v diagrams commonly used in astronomy . as the dependence on @xmath36 of the flux densities is often only weakly coupled to its dependence on @xmath37 ( to the extent that the dependence on stellar latitude of the star properties is only weakly coupled to its dependence on @xmath30 ) polar coordinates",
    "are better suited to such analyses , displaying quantities such as @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it is convenient to express the components of the wind velocities in the star frame ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "their symmetry properties are detailed in appendix  [ seca2 ] .",
    "precisely , we define a radial component @xmath40 , an axial component @xmath41 along the star axis and a rotation component about the star axis , @xmath42 . in terms of the stellar latitude @xmath43 and stellar longitude @xmath44 , the @xmath18 components of the wind velocity are therefore @xmath45 ; @xmath46 ; and @xmath47 respectively and the doppler velocity reads :    @xmath48      for stars that have lived long enough on the agb for the morphology of their gas envelope to be significantly altered , the sky map of the measured flux , @xmath49 , directly reveals the projection of the star axis on the sky plane . however , this is often not the case for agb stars having mass loss rate at the scale of @xmath50 m@xmath51yr@xmath15 or smaller : they display spherical morphology and axial symmetry , if present , can only be revealed from the velocity distribution of the wind .    however , mapping the mean value @xmath52 of the gas velocity on the sky plane is not sufficient to find the projection of the star axis .",
    "expansion and rotation combine with different symmetry properties , resulting in an apparent tilt of the projection of the star axis on the sky plane , by an unknown amount .",
    "it is only in the cases of pure rotation and pure expansion that the axis of the star is an axis of symmetry of the sky map .",
    "however , in such cases , this axis of symmetry is the projection of the star axis in the case of pure expansion , but is perpendicular to it in the case of pure rotation .",
    "it is therefore necessary , in order to evaluate the value of @xmath20 , the position angle of the projection of the star axis on the sky plane , to exploit the information contained in the velocity spectra rather than integrating over velocities .",
    "we illustrate this point with a series of simulations , the results of which are displayed in figure  [ fig3 ] . in this figure , the angle @xmath36 is the position angle of the pixel on the sky map .",
    "the positive @xmath1 axis has @xmath53 , the positive @xmath2 axis has @xmath54 , etc .",
    "the doppler velocity @xmath3 is measured positive when red shifted .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] includes six different sets , each associated with a particular orientation @xmath21 of the star axis .",
    "the position angle of the projection of the star axis on the sky plane is always @xmath55 , meaning pointing north . changing its value results simply in a rotation of the sky map about the origin , meaning a simple translation of the @xmath36 vs @xmath3 p - v diagrams along the @xmath36 axis .",
    "the inclination of the star axis with respect to the line of sight ( @xmath4 axis ) is measured by the angle @xmath21 indicated on the figure , between @xmath56 and @xmath57 in steps of @xmath56 . for @xmath58",
    "the star is seen pole on ; for @xmath59 the observer is in the equatorial plane of the star .",
    "simulations are made for three cases , each corresponding to a column : pure expansion on the left , a combination of expansion and rotation in the middle and pure rotation on the right .",
    "the star properties are supposed to be invariant under rotation about the star axis .",
    "the effective emissivity is taken isotropic with dependence in @xmath31 on the distance @xmath30 from the star .",
    "two different forms , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , are used to define the dependence of the gas velocity on the star latitude , each corresponding to a row in the figure .",
    "the velocities are otherwise supposed to be independent of the star longitude ( imposed by rotational invariance ) and of the distance @xmath30 to the star ( the absence of velocity gradients is a simplification expected not to have important consequences on the qualitative comments made here ) .",
    "moreover , they are supposed to be symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane , implying central symmetry when combined with rotational invariance , meaning that changing @xmath5 in @xmath62 leaves the effective emissivity invariant and changes the sign of the gas velocity .",
    "this corresponds to adding @xmath63 to @xmath36 and its effect is immediately visible in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the expansion velocity @xmath40 is taken purely radial and the rotation velocity @xmath42 is taken perpendicular to the star axis . in both cases @xmath60 and @xmath61 , rotation is enhanced near the equator and expansion is enhanced near the poles . for each value of @xmath21 the upper row is for case @xmath60 , @xmath64 in the lower row , case @xmath61 , @xmath40 is set to 0 and @xmath42 to @xmath65 for @xmath66 while @xmath42 is set to zero and @xmath40 to @xmath65 for @xmath67 ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "each simulation is illustrated by two panels .",
    "the upper panel is the p - v diagram , @xmath36 vs @xmath3 , with the abscissa running from @xmath68 kms@xmath15 to 10 kms@xmath15 and the ordinate from 0 to @xmath69 ; the lower panel is the projection of the diagram on the velocity axis .    in order to construct an axially symmetric model of the cse of the star",
    ", one needs to find the position of the star axis in space , namely the values of @xmath21 and @xmath20 , before evaluating the values of the effective emissivity and gas velocity as a function of the star latitude @xmath43 and the distance @xmath30 to the star .",
    "once @xmath20 is known , one can rotate the data on the sky map in order to have @xmath55 , namely the projection of the star axis pointing north .",
    "then the star properties display simple symmetries with respect to transformation @xmath70 , changing @xmath5 in @xmath71 and transformation @xmath72 , changing @xmath5 in @xmath73 ; the doppler velocity is even under @xmath70 and odd under @xmath72 for pure rotation and even under @xmath72 and odd under @xmath70 for pure expansion .",
    "these symmetries are clearly seen in figure  [ fig3 ] in the cases of pure expansion ( left columns ) or pure rotation ( right columns ) . however",
    ", if one does not know the value of @xmath20 ( and one has no reason to know it a priori ) , the symmetry obeyed by the doppler velocity as a function of @xmath36 does not tell the value of @xmath20 : the values associated with pure expansion and pure rotation differ by @xmath57 .",
    "it is then essential to make a distinction between the effects of expansion and rotation on the doppler velocity and the p - v diagrams before having a chance to measure @xmath20 . assuming that we know @xmath21 and @xmath20 , and given the dependence on @xmath30 and @xmath43 of the effective emissivity and of the gas velocity , one can calculate , for each panel of figure  [ fig3 ] , the flux density @xmath74 for each pixel @xmath9 , or equivalently @xmath23 .",
    "further details are given in appendix  [ seca3 ] .      in this case , the flux density is independent of @xmath36 : the whole information is contained in the projections on the @xmath3 axis of the p - v diagrams .",
    "moreover , the rotation velocity being perpendicular to the line of sight does not contribute to the doppler velocity : for pure rotation , @xmath3 identically cancels .",
    "a consequence is that the mixed case is identical to the pure expansion case .",
    "when attempting to construct a model , there exists no constraint imposed on the forms chosen for the radial and axial components of the velocity vector ( see sub - section  [ sec2.2 ] ) , respectively @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( not to mention @xmath42 , which can take any value ! ) .",
    "in particular , the hypothesis of rotational invariance is of no use in this case : all it says is that the measured flux density @xmath26 must be independent of @xmath36 .",
    "either it is , in which case the data are consistent with the hypothesis , or it is not , in which case they are not .    in summary , when @xmath75 , there is nothing to be learned about rotation and about the dependence of the expansion velocity on the star latitude and the distance from the star .",
    "but when making assumptions , on the basis of physics arguments , about the form they take , one can reconstruct the values of the effective emissivity and expansion velocity at any point in space .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath11 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 depend only on @xmath30 the integral equation is easily solved to give @xmath78 for any @xmath30 value .",
    "then , assuming particular forms for the @xmath30 dependence of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , one can also calculate them for any @xmath30 value .",
    "in such a case , one obtains a spherical model of the cse .",
    "in this case , as @xmath82 , the angle @xmath36 measures the maximal value taken by the stellar latitude @xmath43 in a given pixel ( for @xmath83 ) : @xmath84    in the case of pure expansion , as @xmath85 , the doppler velocity tends to @xmath40 when @xmath4 is large . near the @xmath1 axis , @xmath86 , one is probing low latitudes where @xmath40 cancels . on the contrary , near the @xmath2 axis , @xmath87",
    ", one is probing large latitudes where @xmath40 takes its maximal values .",
    "the maximal values of @xmath3 are therefore reached around @xmath87 and the minimal values around @xmath88 .",
    "the precise value taken by @xmath3 at maximum depends on the dependence of @xmath40 over @xmath43 , the larger the more concentrated near the poles are high @xmath40 values .    in the case of pure rotation , as @xmath89 the @xmath90 term modulates the maximal value of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath36 : it oscillates between @xmath91 and @xmath92 when @xmath36 goes from 0 to @xmath63 , cancelling at @xmath87 .",
    "when @xmath81 , contrary to the previous case ( @xmath75 ) , rotational invariance can not be verified but , if it is assumed to be obeyed , it strongly constrains the data .",
    "it implies that for a given value of @xmath2 , the effective emissivity is a function of only @xmath30 and @xmath93 , namely of @xmath30 alone .",
    "therefore , for each value of @xmath2 , one can write @xmath94 an integral equation easily solvable by iteration .",
    "this property has been known for a long time and is being applied extensively in deprojection algorithms used in optical astronomy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "rotational invariance constrains the dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath1 for each value of @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , for each value of @xmath2 , @xmath40 and @xmath42 depend only on @xmath30 , so does therefore @xmath95 . assuming particular forms for the @xmath30-dependence of @xmath40 and @xmath42",
    ", one can then evaluate their values at each point in space .",
    "more precisely , for each value of @xmath2 , as long as the forms chosen for @xmath40 and @xmath42 depend on a small enough number of parameters compared with the number of pixels , one can calculate the values taken by these parameters and obtain @xmath40 and @xmath42 as functions of @xmath30 and @xmath96 , namely as functions of @xmath30 and @xmath43 .    in summary ,",
    "when @xmath59 , one can not verify the validity of the hypothesis of rotational invariance ( even if one can infer its absence when @xmath49 and @xmath97 are not equal ) .",
    "but , assuming it , one can evaluate the effective emissivity at any point in space .",
    "one can also evaluate the values taken by @xmath40 and @xmath42 at any point in space once arbitrary forms , chosen according to physics arguments , have been adopted for their @xmath30-dependence , but @xmath41 can take any arbitrary value .      in a given pixel ,",
    "both pure rotation and pure expansion typically generate double - horned spectral distributions .",
    "indeed , if @xmath98 is the maximal value taken by @xmath99 in this pixel , @xmath100 is infinite at @xmath101 where .",
    "a simple illustration is obtained using and .",
    "the corresponding spectral distributions are respectively proportional to @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the limits of the spectrum are @xmath104 , with @xmath105 for pure rotation and @xmath106 for pure expansion . in both cases",
    ", the spectrum grows from its value at @xmath107 to infinity at the limits .",
    "details are given in appendix  [ seca4 ] .",
    "the simplest case is case @xmath61 : @xmath4 probes either inside the cone where it sees only expansion or outside where it sees only rotation .",
    "hence , for case b , the middle columns of figure  [ fig3 ] are simply the superposition of the left and right columns .",
    "this remains qualitatively true when the regions probed by @xmath4 are dominated by a single regime , rotation or expansion , respectively near the equator or near the poles .",
    "however , in general , for a given pixel , @xmath3 receives significant contributions from both rotation and expansion . as a result , when mapping @xmath52 , one sees a symmetry that reflects both the value of @xmath20 and the relative importance of rotation and expansion : figure  [ fig5 ] illustrates the difficulty of finding the axis of the star when nothing is known a priori about their relative contributions .",
    "the next sections ( [ sec2.3.5 ] , [ sec2.4 ] and [ sec2.5 ] ) address issues related to this problem , the nature of which deserves some preliminary comments .",
    "a first remark is that we are concerned here with the kinematics of the cse , not its morphology , motivated by the fact that many low mass - loss rate agb stars display an essentially spherical morphology .",
    "if such is not the case , namely if axisymmetry is already revealed by the morphology , so much the better : the projection of the star axis on the sky plane will be immediately identified .",
    "but the general problems of measuring the inclination @xmath21 of the star axis with respect to the line of sight and of telling expansion from rotation will remain .",
    "for this reason , we assume in what follows that the effective emissivity is spherically symmetric .",
    "a second remark is related with understanding what is causing the apparent tilt of the star axis in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "for such a tilt to take place , as already mentioned , two conditions must be obeyed : both rotation and expansion must be present and @xmath21 must differ from both @xmath108 and @xmath57 . but a third condition is also mandatory : expansion must deviate from isotropic , namely be bipolar ( isotropic expansion contributes equally to positive and negative values of @xmath3 , causing the mean to cancel ) .",
    "all three conditions make sense from a physics point of view and detecting the possible simultaneous presence of rotation and expansion is a difficult but important task in agb astrophysics . taking the @xmath2 axis as star axis ,",
    "the velocity fields of expansion and rotation have different symmetries : rotation is symmetric about the @xmath1 axis and antisymmetric about the @xmath2 axis , expansion is symmetric about the @xmath2 axis and antisymmetric about the @xmath1 axis .",
    "namely , in the case of pure rotation , the projection of the star axis on the sky plane is perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the map , while in the case of pure expansion it is the symmetry axis of the map . in general , in a given pixel , @xmath52 receives contributions from both expansion and rotation , respectively @xmath109 and @xmath110 . assuming that both @xmath40 and @xmath42 are independent of @xmath30 and even functions of @xmath111 , the problem is scale invariant and @xmath112 , @xmath113 and their sum",
    "do not depend on @xmath37 , but only on @xmath36 .",
    "this is immediately apparent on figure  [ fig5 ] . while @xmath112 is symmetric about @xmath54 , @xmath113 is symmetric about @xmath108 .",
    "but their sum , in general , has no reason to display any symmetry .",
    "indeed the apparent symmetry of the map displayed in figure  [ fig5 ] is only approximate and the symmetry is in fact destroyed rather than the symmetry axis being simply tilted .",
    "a third remark is that while pure rotation splits the sky map in two regions , one blue - shifted on one side of the projection of the star axis on the sky plane , the other red - shifted on the other side , pure expansion can generate both blue - shifted and red - shifted velocities in a same pixel if the polar outflows are broad enough .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure  [ fig3 ] , particularly for large values of @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath55 , in the vicinity of the @xmath1 axis , changing @xmath2 in @xmath114 leaves the velocity spectrum unchanged in the case of pure rotation but reflects it about the origin in the case of pure expansion .",
    "similarly , in the vicinity of the @xmath2 axis , changing @xmath1 in @xmath115 leaves the velocity spectrum unchanged in the case of pure expansion but reflects it about the origin in the case of pure rotation .",
    "appendix  [ seca5 ] introduces a function @xmath116 of the position angle constructed on this remark , which is meant to reach its minimum at @xmath20 .",
    "however , in case a , when @xmath21 is sufficiently different from 0 and 90@xmath117 , and when both expansion and rotation contribute significantly to @xmath3 , @xmath116 is found to be less dependent on @xmath20 and the identification of the minimum is difficult .",
    "it is interesting to remark that a clear minimum is always found in case @xmath61 . in this case , one is probing either the interior of the cone and sees only expansion , or the exterior of the cone , and sees only rotation : rotation and expansion never compete at a same point in space .    in practice ,",
    "when there are reasons to suspect the co - existence of significant rotation and expansion velocity components , the best will be to use a model making optimal use of the known physical properties of the system and including @xmath20 among the parameters to be adjusted by chi square minimization .",
    "an example is given in section 3.1 .",
    "having found the value of @xmath20 is not sufficient to tell expansion from rotation . even in a pure case , rotation around the y axis and expansion along the @xmath2 axis will both produce p - v diagrams odd under @xmath70 and even under @xmath72 .",
    "a discriminator between rotation and expansion would therefore be a useful tool .",
    "after rotation of the data on the sky plane making @xmath20 to cancel , in the case of pure radial expansion @xmath118 is positive and in the case of pure rotation @xmath119 has the sign of @xmath120 .",
    "appendix  [ seca6 ] makes use of this property to construct a function of @xmath36 , @xmath121 , as a possible discriminator between rotation and expansion .",
    "the values of @xmath121 at @xmath122 and @xmath123 or its integral over @xmath36 are generally good indicators of the relative importance of rotation over expansion . however , when dealing with a small perturbation to a global isotropic expansion , it is difficult to assert its precise nature , rotation or bipolar expansion . here again , as in the preceding sub - section , the use of a model adjusted to best fit the data will often be the most efficient method",
    ". it will include what is known of the physical properties of the system , in particular the likely form taken by the radial dependence of the rotation and expansion velocities .",
    "the radial dependences of the rotation velocity ( typically keplerian or decreasing faster at large distances ) and of the expansion velocity are indeed important quantities to evaluate .",
    "we address briefly the issue in section 3 , in the context of rs cnc and l1527 but a general treatment is beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "our choice in the present section ( constant rotation and expansion velocities ) is motivated by simplicity and by the fact that it has little impact on the general qualitative ideas developed in the article because of the rapid radial decrease of the effective emissivity . in practice ,",
    "preconceived ideas about the radial dependences of the rotation and expansion velocities , based on physics arguments , will help with the solution of the problem .",
    "having evaluated the value of @xmath20 and assuming for simplicity that @xmath55 , one needs to evaluate the value of the inclination @xmath21 of the star axis with respect to the line of sight . for the star axis to be well defined",
    ", there must be a large enough asymmetry of the effective emissivity and/or the wind velocity : spherical distributions prevent the definition of such an axis . as a result ,",
    "what can be generally measured is the product of a measure of the inclination , typically @xmath124 , by a measure of the elongation of the effective emissivity and/or velocities along the star axis .",
    "this result , which is well known for morphology ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * @xcite @xcite & @xcite ) is also valid for kinematics .",
    "as detailed in appendix  [ seca7 ] , this implies strong correlations relating the inclination angle to the elongation of the outflow on the star axis , namely the ratio of polar to equatorial wind velocities .",
    "one expects the @xmath37-dependence of the integrated flux to carry much information about the @xmath30-dependence of the effective emissivity . indeed , from pure dimensional considerations , one would expect a @xmath125 dependence of the effective emissivity to produce a @xmath126 dependence of its integral on the sky map . as detailed in appendix",
    "[ seca8 ] , this is generally the case .",
    "similarly , the sky map of the mean of the absolute value of the doppler velocity is found to reveal directly the presence of velocity gradients .",
    "these results illustrate further the advantage of displaying the measured flux densities in terms of polar rather than cartesian coordinates on the sky plane . their dependence on @xmath37",
    "is related simply to the dependence on @xmath30 of the effective emissivity and wind velocity , while their dependence on @xmath36 is related to the dependence of the effective emissivity and wind velocity on the orientation of the star axis and on star latitude . without having recourse to a model",
    ", much information about the morphology and kinematics of the cse can be obtained from simple quantities constructed directly from the expression of the flux densities in polar coordinates .",
    "as a first application of the results of the preceding sections , we consider a typical agb star , rs cnc that has been studied in some detail , in particular from observations of emission using the plateau de bure interferometer @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] displays the dependence on @xmath37 and @xmath36 of the measured flux multiplied by @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath37-dependence is well described by a power law of the form @xmath127 implying a of the effective emissivity of the approximate form @xmath128 .",
    "the @xmath36-dependence is very uniform , with excursions from the mean not exceeding @xmath129 ; figure  [ fig6 ] displays also the dependence on @xmath37 and @xmath36 of the mean doppler velocity , which reveals a very clear north - south asymmetry .",
    "the @xmath37-dependence suggests the presence of a significant negative velocity gradient , at variance with the results of the best fits published earlier @xcite , which imply a positive velocity gradient both at the equator and near the poles . this is a good illustration of a general situation and deserves therefore a detailed analysis .",
    "the model of @xcite assumes a stationary regime : a radial wind velocity decreasing with @xmath30 implies a product @xmath130 ( @xmath7 is the gas density ) increasing with @xmath30 at the same rate .",
    "however , the dependence on @xmath30 of the effective emissivity includes in addition a temperature factor ( that accounts for the population of the emitting quantum state and the probability of emission ) and a uv dissociation factor . in the model of @xcite , the radial dependence of the temperature",
    "is discussed in detail , using in particular the ratio of and emission , and the uv dissociation factor is taken from the literature . both decrease strongly with @xmath30 . as a result , the product @xmath131 ( @xmath11 is the effective emissivity ) decreases with @xmath30 because the contributions of the temperature and of uv dissociation win over the contribution of stationarity . the hypothesis of stationarity links the radial dependence of @xmath131 to that of @xmath34 , which receives therefore three contributions : a 1.9%/arcsecond decrease from temperature , a 3.4%/arcsec decrease from uv dissociation and 1.8%/arcsec increase from the velocity gradient , adjusted to best fit the observed 3.5%/arcsec negative velocity gradient observed in the data .",
    "the result of @xcite is therefore perfectly consistent with the observation of a negative velocity gradient made here , the reason being that the two velocity gradients measure in fact different quantities , the result of @xcite resting heavily on the hypothesis of a stationary flow .",
    "the question then arises of the validity of the assumption of stationarity used in the model : the radial scale spanned by figure  [ fig6 ] means some 10@xmath132 years , the wind velocity might have increased somewhat over such a long period , implying higher gas densities at large distances from the star and violating the stationarity hypothesis . to answer the question",
    "we compare the quality of two fits : one assuming stationarity and allowing for gradients on the velocities , the other assuming instead @xmath30-independent velocities but allowing for gradients on the fluxes of matter .",
    "the best fit is obtained for the scenario that assumes stationarity , but the other fit gives a value of @xmath133 that is only 12% larger .",
    "this result illustrates the difficulty to ascertain the validity of the stationarity hypothesis with confidence from the presently available observations : a dependence on age of the mass - loss rate reproduces the data nearly as well without requiring the presence of a positive velocity gradient .",
    "rs cnc is also a good test case to illustrate the problems associated with the measurement of the orientation of the star axis and the relative importance of expansion and rotation .",
    "the p - v diagram displayed in figure  [ fig7 ] , @xmath36 vs @xmath3 , shows arcs near @xmath107 and at @xmath134 kms@xmath15 in phase opposition at a same value of @xmath36 , namely populating both positive and negative doppler velocity intervals , showing , at least qualitatively , that one is dealing with expansion rather than with rotation .",
    "moreover , the absence of significant features in quadrature , i.e. shifted in phase by @xmath135 with respect to these arcs , indicate that a possible contribution of rotation , if present , must be quite small ( again qualitatively ) . the asymmetry parameter @xmath121 , defined in a6 , reaches minimal values at the 10% level around @xmath136 and @xmath137 where the contribution of pure expansion cancels . to better quantify a possible contribution of rotation",
    ", we use the model described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we allow for a rotation velocity having a gaussian dependence on @xmath111 , the sine of stellar latitude , and decreasing with distance as a power of @xmath30 . calling @xmath42 the equatorial rotation velocity at @xmath138 , @xmath139 the @xmath140 of the gaussian and @xmath141 the power index , we obtain a best fit for @xmath142 kms@xmath15 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the only other parameters allowed to vary in the fit are the values of the radial expansion velocities .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] displays the dependences on @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the best fit @xmath133 , both angles being measured with an uncertainty of @xmath145 and the values of the parameters describing the elongation along the star axis are strongly correlated with @xmath21 .",
    "then , fixing @xmath139 and @xmath141 at their best fit values , we obtain the dependence of the best fit @xmath133 on @xmath42 displayed in figure  [ fig7 ] , suggesting that a rotation velocity of up to @xmath1461 kms@xmath15 at @xmath138 could be accommodated by the data . observations , of better sensitivity than presently available would be necessary to conclude reliably on the possible presence of rotation .",
    "ep aqr is a textbook case of an agb star having its axis nearly parallel to the line of sight .",
    "its and emissions have been previously analysed both in terms of spherical winds and of bipolar outflows @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the respective analyses and , as in the case of rs cnc , we limit the present discussion to issues that are of direct relevance to the considerations developed in the previous sections , in particular aiming at a unified picture of the former very different analyses .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows the p - v diagram in the @xmath36 vs @xmath3 plane and its projection on the doppler velocity axis . as expected , it is typical of a star having its axis parallel to the line of sight .",
    "the dependence on both @xmath37 and @xmath36 of the measured flux multiplied by @xmath37 is dominated by important inhomogeneities that extend up to large radii .",
    "the @xmath37-dependence is steeper for than for as expected , with respective power indices @xmath147 and @xmath148 . the sky maps of the mean doppler velocity display a small north - west / south - east asymmetry , interpreted by @xcite as resulting from the small inclination of the star axis on the line of sight .    in the @xmath58 approximation",
    "the stellar longitude @xmath44 is equal to the sky position angle @xmath36 of the pixel and the stellar latitude @xmath43 is related to @xmath4 by the relation @xmath149 .",
    "the relation @xmath150 can then be dealt with in each @xmath151 interval separately . as rotation",
    "can not be detected , we assume a radial wind of velocity @xmath40 . using the relations @xmath152 one can associate in each pixel a value of @xmath4 to each value of @xmath3 if we know @xmath40 : @xmath4 is solution of the equation",
    "@xmath153 namely @xmath154 knowing @xmath4 one also knows and @xmath155 .",
    "an estimate of the effective emissivity averaged over stellar latitude ( corresponding to spherical symmetry of the effective emissivity ) , @xmath156 , can be obtained from the flux measured in each pixel , @xmath157 . in each @xmath151 interval",

    "the relation @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the @xmath4 interval spanned by a velocity bin @xmath164 can then be used in each @xmath23 bin to evaluate the radial expansion velocity , @xmath40 , as a function of @xmath4 in the approximation where the effective emissivity is taken in each @xmath36 bin equal to @xmath165 as evaluated in the previous paragraph . for the purpose of illustration , we do so over the whole @xmath36 range but it can as well be done in each @xmath36 bin separately when the data are of sufficient quality . in order to exclude the equatorial region , where the evaluation of @xmath40 is less reliable , we limit the stellar latitude to the range @xmath166 , with the effect of excluding low values of @xmath30 ( typically smaller than 0.8@xmath14 ) . figure  [ fig9 ] shows the resulting distribution of @xmath40 , averaged over @xmath36 , in the stellar meridian plane .",
    "it gives evidence for a strong polar enhancement , at variance with a weak radial dependence up to @xmath167 .",
    "it provides a unified picture of the two models that have been proposed earlier , the model of @xcite corresponding to @xmath40 dependent on @xmath30 but independent on @xmath43 , that of @xcite corresponding to @xmath40 dependent on @xmath43 but independent on @xmath30 .",
    "the projections of the @xmath40 distributions on the @xmath111 and @xmath30 axes illustrate the preference for the latter over the former .      the analysis presented in the preceding section",
    "can be applied to any observation : it is always possible to calculate , given a value of @xmath40 , for each pixel and each doppler velocity , the quantity @xmath168 and obtain this way a representation of the observation , with each point @xmath5 given an effective emissivity @xmath169    such a representation will have something to do with reality if the kinematics is indeed dominated by a radial expansion with constant velocity @xmath40 .",
    "in practical cases , this may often be approximately the case , at least locally in some domain of the @xmath170 space .",
    "in such cases , it is usually possible to have an estimate of the range in which @xmath40 may reasonably fall ( clearly , @xmath40 must exceed @xmath99 ) .",
    "it is then useful to have some idea of the distortion implied by the adopted representation . in particular when @xmath3 approaches @xmath171 .",
    "in such a case , @xmath4 goes to infinity and @xmath172 , and a fortiori @xmath173 , cancel .",
    "the representation becomes meaningless in this case : obviously , if there is no expansion to start with , there is no chance to learn about the morphology .",
    "however , when @xmath40 exceeds @xmath99 significantly , the representation is well behaved and the topology is conserved : a detached shell remains a detached shell , an isolated clump remains an isolated clump , a cavity remains a cavity .",
    "while such a representation must be interpreted with care , remembering that it is ill - behaved when @xmath99 approaches @xmath40 , and keeping in mind the possible presence of important distortions , it provides a convenient 3-d visualization of the morphology , particularly useful in complex cases .",
    "such an example is illustrated in figure  [ fig10 ] , displaying maps of the effective emissivity of mira ceti in @xmath174 planes , with @xmath175 , for various values of the angle @xmath44 between the plane and the @xmath1 axis .",
    "it shows clearly the presence of arcs of detached shells .      the red rectangle is a post - agb star that has been extensively studied at optical , infrared and far infrared wavelengths .",
    "its co emission has been recently analysed along the lines presented in the present paper using alma data @xcite .",
    "it has its axis nearly parallel to the sky plane and displays density and velocity configurations similar to case b considered in the preceding sections : two distinct regions with a rather sharp separation between them , a conical bipolar outflow and a rotating equatorial volume .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details and limit our comments to a brief summary of the main results . in the @xmath81 approximation ,",
    "the stellar latitude @xmath43 is related to @xmath2 by the relation @xmath96 and the stellar longitude @xmath44 is related to @xmath1 by the relation @xmath176 . rather than dealing with independent @xmath151 intervals as in the preceding section ,",
    "we deal instead with independent @xmath2 intervals .",
    "namely , in each pixel , once we know @xmath4 we know @xmath177 the measured flux is : the effective emissivity expressed as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath111 can be obtained from this integral equation if we assume that it is invariant under rotation about the star axis .",
    "then , one can write @xmath178 and solve the integral equation . deprojections of optical images have been presented earlier using this same feature ( see for example * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . as two different co lines",
    "have been observed , co(6 - 5 ) and co(3 - 2 ) , it is possible to disentangle the effects of temperature and density and evaluate them in space as shown in figure 11 . using the result of such deprojection , and the structure that it suggests , as guidance to define flux lines ,",
    "it is then possible to construct a simple model of the wind kinematics inspired from the observed morphology .",
    "it gives evidence for two well distinct volumes that host very different kinematical regimes and describes simply the radial dependence of both the expansion and rotation velocities .",
    "many considerations developed in the present article may in fact have applications in a much broader context .",
    "we illustrate this point in the present sub - section with the example of a young protostar , l1527 irs .",
    "it is in its earliest stages of star formation , with a cse of about one solar mass , and has been recently observed by @xcite in the continuum ( 1.3 and 3.4 mm wavelength ) and on the @xmath179 line at the submillimeter array ( sma ) and the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy ( carma ) .",
    "observations of the line made at alma have been reported by @xcite .",
    "all above observations have established the presence of in - falling gas onto a rotating disk surrounding the protostar and having its axis close to the @xmath1 axis .",
    "here , we use alma observations ( 2012.1.00647.s ) of the line having a slightly better spatial resolution than those used by @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to a detailed analysis by @xcite .",
    "as the axis of the rotating disk is very close to the @xmath1 axis , we redefine @xmath10 as east - west symmetrized flux densities , @xmath180 $ ] . figure  [ fig12 ] displays maps of the integrated flux @xmath181 , redefined this way , and of the mean doppler velocity @xmath52 .",
    "they are dominated by rotation , red - shifted north and blue - shifted south . in the case of pure rotation about the @xmath1 axis",
    ", we expect to cancel for @xmath182 ( one side of the @xmath1 axis to be blue - shifted and the other side red - shifted ) . as a result , @xmath183 is equal to @xmath10 everywhere .    on the contrary , in the case of",
    "pure in - fall , .",
    "we may then define @xmath184 as a measure of the amount of flux density associated with in - fall .",
    "maps of @xmath185 and @xmath186 are displayed in figure  [ fig12 ] .",
    "the map of @xmath185 reveals the shape of the rotating cse in the northern and southern hemispheres and @xmath186 , much smaller than @xmath185 , displays a clear enhancement of the in - falling flux along the diagonals of the map , in conformity with what is expected from accretion onto a flared disk . when swapping the @xmath1 and @xmath2 axes , the present situation is reminiscent of the red rectangle , the difference being that here rotation and in - fall combine everywhere while in the red rectangle case rotation and expansion are confined to different stellar latitudes . as in the red rectangle case ,",
    "the effective emissivity can be calculated in space by solving the relevant integral equation and the kinematics can be estimated assuming power law dependences of the rotation and in - fall velocities on @xmath30 .",
    "a significant difference between protostars and evolved stars is that the former are embedded from the beginning into dense clouds from which they build their cse , while the latter build their cse from their own atmosphere ; as a result the observation of protostar cses is subject to absorption complications that are absent from the observations of the cses of evolved stars .",
    "this is the case here where the doppler velocities nearing the star systemic velocity are completely obscured .",
    "a detailed analysis of the consequences @xcite is beyond the scope of the present sub - section , the only purpose of which is to illustrate the very strong similarities between the studies of expanding cses of evolved stars and in - falling cses of protostars .",
    "many observations are not limited to a single molecular line , but often include flux densities associated with two or more different lines of a same molecule , for example two rotation lines of carbon dioxide . in such cases ,",
    "very precious information is carried by the ratio of the measured flux densities . in making such a ratio",
    ", the gas density drops out and the emission probabilities are well known : if absorption can be neglected , the ratio of the flux densities is a direct measure of the relative population of the emitting quantum states , namely a direct measure of temperature . in many cases ,",
    "the distance from the star is large enough for absorption to be small , but in any case the study of the line ratio provides very important information : it measures the temperature when absorption can be neglected and when the gas is in thermal equilibrium and has been in such a state for a long time , but if such hypotheses are not valid , it carries information about the importance and nature of their violation . making good use of multi - line observations should not be limited to mapping the flux ratio measured in each pixel : in principle , the comparison between the observed lines can  and should  be extended to any other quantity that has been used in the analysis .      in practice ,",
    "real stars are often very far from obeying the axial symmetry assumed in the present article .",
    "a much more lumpy landscape is often to be expected . as a result ,",
    "two different issues need to be considered : one is to which extent does this impact on the value and interest of a description that assumes axisymmetry , or even central symmetry ; the other is to which extent deviations from the model can be simply described . while the answer to such questions is bound to carry some subjectivity , an essential preliminary consideration is to evaluate quantitatively the importance of the observed deviations .",
    "independently from any model , deviations from central symmetry can directly be evaluated from the asymmetry parameter @xmath187    sky maps and p - v diagrams of this quantity tell both the importance and the nature of the observed deviations : they may be distributed more or less randomly in @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 or be concentrated in well - defined lumps .",
    "a systematic study of this asymmetry is an important complement to the studies described in the previous sections .",
    "revealing deviations from rotation invariance about the star axis can not be done so directly .",
    "partial information is contained in the symmetry  or lack of  about the @xmath2 axis ( or @xmath188 axis if @xmath20 differs from 0 ) but extracting the full information requires a detailed analysis of the dependence of @xmath133 on the star longitude ( which is known in the model but unknown in the data ) .",
    "the outstanding quality of alma data allows for evaluating such a @xmath133 much more reliably than was previously possible . ideally , if the quality of the data would allow for a reliable evaluation of measurement uncertainties one could work in the @xmath189 plane and evaluate the degree of confidence attached to the fits and the uncertainties and correlation coefficients attached to each of the model parameters in units of standard deviations . in general , however , one is far from such a situation . even under ideal conditions , a significant lumpiness of",
    "the observed fluxes usually prevents a very faithful description , the model being at best a crude approximation of reality . as a result",
    ", the best fit values of @xmath133 significantly exceed the number of degrees of freedom and one must rely on subjective arguments to obtain a sensible evaluation of the uncertainties attached to each of the model parameters .",
    "the aim of the present work is to help constructing 3-d models of the cse of axisymmetric radio sources , essentially evolved stars or protostars .",
    "the accent is on the kinematics , central to the astrophysics of agb stars , more than on the morphology , for which exists an abundant literature , in particular in the domain of the deprojection of optical images of planetary nebulae ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". it does not have the pretension to give recipes , not even strict guidelines , but simply to illustrate possibly more quantitative approaches to data analysis than often used in the current literature .",
    "each star is a particular case : before starting modelling its cse , one must first take into account the information available , optical , infrared or radio , and the physics considerations that are of relevance . in the present section ,",
    "we summarize the results obtained in the preceding sections .",
    "a number of preliminary points should be systematically examined before undertaking any modelling : they imply having a first close look at the data without requiring the help of a model .",
    "in particular the sky maps of @xmath190 , of @xmath52 and of @xmath34 and their projections on the @xmath37 and @xmath36 axes provide essential information .",
    "in addition to obtaining a global evaluation of the steepness of the decrease with @xmath30 of the effective emissivity , one learns from them to which extent central symmetry is obeyed ; whether there is any evidence for the effective emissivity to depart from spherical symmetry ; whether axial symmetry is revealed on the @xmath52 map ; whether there is evidence for significant velocity gradients .    in a spirit of minimizing qualitative arguments and quantifying as much as possible the results of the analysis",
    ", use should be made of simple quantities that carry important information .",
    "examples have been given , such as @xmath191 and @xmath121 , which may help the evaluations of the orientation of the star axis in space and of the relative contributions of expansion along the star axis and rotation about it .",
    "they are not unique , other indicators and discriminators may be found better adapted to such and such a particular case .",
    "particular attention must be given to correlations between model parameters , such as between the inclination of the star axis on the line of sight , @xmath21 , and the elongation of the effective emissivity and/or wind velocity distribution along the star axis .",
    "if a @xmath133 minimization method is used to adjust the model parameters , one should look at the dependence of @xmath133 on @xmath21 , leaving all other parameters free to vary .",
    "as well known from the practice of such studies , p - v diagrams carry very precious information .",
    "however , we have argued that using polar rather than cartesian coordinates in the sky plane is often better suited to making the best of them .",
    "in particular , the @xmath36 vs @xmath3 diagrams have the advantage of being simply translated along the @xmath36 axis when @xmath20 is varied , a useful feature when @xmath20 is not known with precision , and their symmetry properties tell about the relative purity  or lack of  of expansion vs rotation .",
    "one must keep in mind that when expansion and rotation contribute significantly to the wind velocity in a same region of space , causing spiralling , the determination of the star axis is difficult .",
    "however , when expansion and rotation contribute significantly in different regions of space , this comment does not apply and their contributions to the p - v diagrams are simply superimposed",
    ".    the above arguments , as important as they may be , are not sufficient to construct a model .",
    "physics considerations must also be taken in due account .",
    "while a precise hydrodynamic description is well beyond the scope of the present considerations , some of its most obvious features must be kept in mind when deciding on the form given to the effective emissivity and velocities .",
    "in particular the validity of the stationarity hypothesis needs to be critically discussed .",
    "the concrete examples that have been given as illustrations of the above arguments have contributed new results to earlier analyses of the co emission of the cse of agb stars .",
    "the study of rs cnc has given an opportunity to comment on the hypothesis of stationarity of the wind regime and on a possible rotation of the equatorial volume about the star axis .",
    "in both cases , limits have been given to their possible contributions .",
    "in the case of ep aqr , a picture has been drawn that unifies the presentation of the two models that had been proposed earlier , one with isotropic but @xmath30-dependent winds , the other with a bipolar outflow .",
    "evidence has been given in favour of the latter .",
    "results obtained in the case of the post - agb red rectangle have been briefly recalled .",
    "using mira ceti as an example , we have commented about the value of constructing , at least locally , a 3-d representation under the hypothesis of radial expansion at constant velocity .",
    "such a representation is particularly useful to visualise the topology of the effective emissivity and reveal the presence of possible detached arcs , cavities , or isolated lumps .",

    ", the subtraction of the flux density measured on the axis , rotation on the @xmath1 axis and expansion on the @xmath2 axis , leaves us with the contribution that changes sign under reflection about the axis , expansion about the @xmath1 axis and rotation about the @xmath2 axis .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath2 axis is the projection on the sky plane of the star axis , @xmath116 nearly cancels when subtracting the two square brackets from each other . the value of @xmath20 associated with the star axis is therefore expected to be that for which the quantity @xmath116 , calculated for flux densities rotated by @xmath20 about the origin on the sky map , reaches a minimum .",
    "the quantities @xmath270 stand for the uncertainties attached to the measured flux densities . here",
    ", we use for @xmath270 the square root of the sum of the four flux densities appearing in the two square brackets of the relevant sum ( which would be proper for purely statistical uncertainties ) . figure  [ figa4 ]",

    "it is drawn for @xmath271 and for @xmath272 and @xmath273 for different values of @xmath274 , namely of the relative importance of rotation vs expansion .",
    "the minimum is generally very shallow and in one case , @xmath275 , it is off by @xmath276 .",
    "better indicators than @xmath116 may possibly be conceived , but they will always reveal the difficulty of measuring @xmath20 when rotation and expansion compete for inclinations around @xmath271 .        hence , writing @xmath282 , for pure rotation while for pure radial expansion @xmath283 .",

    "@xmath284 independently from both @xmath36 and @xmath21 .",
    "the value of @xmath121 at @xmath86 , @xmath87 or its integral over @xmath36 should therefore be good indicators of the relative importance of rotation over expansion .",
    "however , as soon as rotation is mixed with some expansion , even when the latter is isotropic , @xmath121 starts departing from unity .",
    "indeed , in the present article , for example in figure  [ fig3 ] , we usually considered expansion cancelling on the star equator . in reality , even in the presence of a clear bipolar outflow , some expansion may take place in the equatorial region .",
    "moreover , the cse may start its evolution with a small bipolar outflow and no global expansion or , on the contrary , with a small isotropic expansion . in the latter case ,",
    "when the bipolar outflow starts to emerge , it is but a small perturbation to the isotropic expansion .",
    "we take this in consideration by writing @xmath285 and @xmath286 ( @xmath42 must cancel at the poles ) and use an isotropic effective emissivity @xmath287 .",
    "the parameters @xmath288 and @xmath289 measure the amount of respectively polar expansion and equatorial rotation that add to the isotropic expansion .",
    "we find that , to a good approximation , @xmath290 and @xmath291 with @xmath292 independent of @xmath289 ( the @xmath90 factor in the contribution of rotation to @xmath3 is the cause ) and @xmath293 independent of @xmath288 . both @xmath292 and @xmath293 increase with respectively @xmath288 and @xmath289 as shown in figure  [ figa5 ] .",
    "the above considerations suggest comparing the p - v diagrams of a @xmath294 case with a @xmath295 case for a same value of @xmath21 .",
    "we choose @xmath271 in order to maximize the effect of expansion and adjust @xmath289 and @xmath288 to have similar values of @xmath121 .",
    "the associated p - v diagrams , shown in figure  [ figa6 ] , display small but significant differences . if , on the contrary , we adjust @xmath289 and @xmath288 to have similar effects on the p - v diagrams , we obtain much larger values of @xmath121 in the @xmath294 case ( rotation ) than in the @xmath295 case ( expansion ) .",
    "figure  [ figa7 ] displays the doppler velocity distributions obtained in this case on the positive @xmath1 and @xmath2 axes .",
    "the small differences illustrate the difficulty of telling expansion from rotation when they are small perturbations to a global isotropic expansion .",
    "we first consider the dependence on @xmath21 of the integrated flux @xmath181 .",
    "its partial derivative with respect to @xmath36 , @xmath296 , is expected to be an indicator of @xmath21 . indeed ,",
    "writing @xmath297 the effective emissivity and using @xmath298 , we obtain @xmath299 namely @xmath300^{-1}\\ ] ]    the dependence of @xmath181 on @xmath36 is indeed an indicator of @xmath301 , however it requires the preliminary knowledge of the dependence of the effective emissivity on the star latitude , measured by @xmath302 .",
    "it is not possible to evaluate @xmath21 independently from the elongation of the effective emissivity along the star axis . indeed , modelling the effective emissivity as @xmath303 ( @xmath30 measures in arcseconds ) , gives :          namely the dependence of the integrated flux on @xmath36 measures the product @xmath307 : the inclination angle @xmath21 of the star axis on the line of sight can not be measured from the map of integrated fluxes independently from the elongation @xmath308 of the effective emissivity along the star axis .",
    "qualitatively , this result is expected to be always true . in the case of a spherically symmetric effective emissivity but axially symmetric wind velocity",
    ", a similar result applies .",
    "it is best seen in the case @xmath61 of section  [ sec2.3 ] , which is particularly simple in this context .",
    "as seen in figure  [ figa3 ] , changing @xmath21 does not change the limits on the sky plane of the expansion cone as long as the ratio @xmath309 is kept constant . using this prescription , one may then readjust the values taken by the expansion and rotation velocities in order to minimize the changes experienced by the measured flux densities . on the axis of the cone , projected on the sky plane as the @xmath2 axis , @xmath310 :",
    "keeping this product constant will limit the effect of changing @xmath21 to small variations of the limits of the velocity spectrum .",
    "similarly , outside the cone , the doppler velocity varies between 0 on the @xmath2 axis ( @xmath311 ) to @xmath312 : again , keeping this product constant will limit the effect of changing @xmath21 to small variations of the limits of the velocity spectrum .    in summary , when modelling the star with case @xmath61 using five parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath313 , @xmath314 and @xmath42 ( @xmath314 inside the cone and @xmath42 outside ) , very strong correlations affect the last four parameters leaving much arbitrariness in the value of @xmath21 .",
    "what we effectively measure are the ratio @xmath309 and the products @xmath315 and @xmath316 .",
    "qualitatively , as for the effective emissivity , we measure the product of the inclination of the star axis on the line of sight by the elongation of the expansion cone .",
    "another evidence for this ambiguity between inclination and elongation was obtained in appendix  [ seca6 ] where @xmath121 was found to include a factor @xmath317 .        hence @xmath324 the @xmath37-dependence of the integrated flux",
    "is simply related to the @xmath30-dependence of the effective emissivity . in particular , in case of a pure power law , @xmath325 @xmath326 is a constant over the sky plane .",
    "if central symmetry is obeyed , the mean value of @xmath3 cancels .",
    "however , velocity gradients can be expected to show up on the expression of the square or absolute value of @xmath3 . in the case of radial expansion and assuming a pure power law dependence of the effective emissivity on @xmath30 ,      in the absence of gradient , @xmath328 is independent of @xmath37 . in general",
    ", developing @xmath40 in powers of @xmath30 , the @xmath37-dependence of @xmath34 depends simply on the @xmath30-dependence of the expansion velocity ."
