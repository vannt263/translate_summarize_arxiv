    "quark confinement is one of the most intriguing problems in qcd .",
    "there are several appealing analogies to sqcd and supergravity which are helpful to guide our intuition . nevertheless , a final explanation of the mechanism in terms of structures of ( non - supersymmetric ) qcd or pure yang - mills theory itself is still missing . more precisely , it is confinement at weak coupling , when the lattice spacing is well below the presumably relevant structures accomplishing this mechanism , that we need to explain .",
    "therefore a closer investigation of various semi - classical configurations in the context of lattice simulations in different phases seems to be necessary .",
    "the first example of an extended excitation which is looked for , nowadays massively , in monte carlo generated gauge field configurations is the instanton @xcite .",
    "it is not completely clear at present to what extent their size ( actually their distribution of sizes ) is influenced by the detection algorithm itself @xcite , but there is no doubt that this scale can be and perhaps has been already decoupled from the lattice spacing .    in a recent publication lattice measurements of the field strength correlator at zero temperature",
    "have been confronted with semi - analytic results of the semi - classically motivated instanton liquid approximation @xcite . the correlation length and strength of the correlation at intermediate distances can be explained within the standard parameters characterizing the instanton liquid .",
    "however , the change of the field strength correlators at the deconfining transition can not be explained in an model based exclusively on self - dual or anti - self - dual configurations @xcite .    according to current folklore",
    ", instantons are not related to confinement at all .",
    "if they are related , we have still to identify the interactions and correlations in the instanton liquid which would make the corresponding sample fields confining .",
    "traditionally , in continuum models , instantons are the relevant configurations to explain spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and are needed to solve the @xmath3 problem @xcite . without the inclusion of ( short range ) instanton correlations one is not able to unterstand the temperature dependence of the chiral condensates and the restoration of chiral symmetry at @xmath4 ( for a schematic model , see ref .",
    "an indirect role for confinement is attributed to instantons because of local correlations between monopoles and instantons @xcite .",
    "monopoles are the agents of another model that has been first formulated in the continuum in order to explain confinement : the dual superconductor scenario invented by thooft and mandelstam @xcite .",
    "it assumes condensation of abelian monopoles and views confinement as a dual meissner effect . that this scenario really takes place has been demonstrated for abelian compact and non - abelian lattice gauge theories by numerical simulations @xcite . in the latter case",
    "abelian monopoles appear as singularities of the gauge fixing procedure and are identified as point - like conserved currents ( degrand - toussaint monopoles @xcite ) in various gauges after abelian projection .",
    "these monopoles have a quantized magnetic charge but no natural size which would be analogous to the instanton size and could point to some confinement scale and corresponding qcd coupling . in the very first attempt it was tried to prove that their _ density _ possesses a continuum limit @xcite .",
    "but the density is strongly affected by short - range lattice artefacts .",
    "there have been methods developed to remove these artefacts ( monopole blocking to obtain an infrared effective action for thick monopoles @xcite , renormalization group motivated smoothing of configurations which reduces point - like abelian monopole currents @xcite ) .",
    "there is one model for an extended , particle - like monopole which could be confronted with first - principle lattice monte carlo configurations .",
    "this is the thooft - polyakov ( hp ) @xcite or  as the limiting case ",
    "the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) monopole @xcite .",
    "it is taken from the georgi - glashow model and re - interpreted as a static configuration in pure gauge theory identifying the adjoint higgs field with the @xmath5 component of the vector potential . as a solution of the classical non - abelian field equations",
    "the bps monopole satisfies the self - duality condition and carries electric charge .",
    "this is the reason why in pure gauge theory we want to call the bps monopole solution also _",
    "dyon_.    the present paper represents an attempt to examine isolated configurations of this kind under the influence of quantum fluctuations . a first investigation in this spirit",
    "was reported by smit and van der sijs @xcite .",
    "a particular feature in our present work ( similar as in @xcite ) is the possibility to select the semi - classical background field by applying specific boundary conditions fixing the tangential vector potential at the surface of a spatial box .",
    "the main emphasis in the work of our precedessors was to select the coupling ( or length scale ) at which these monopoles would condense at zero physical temperature ( and to determine the mass of the quantum monopole ) in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite . here ,",
    "in contrast , we want first to elaborate on the question which solutions of the lattice equations of motion are compatible with the boundary conditions . only if they are invariably recovered from heating and cooling cycles we can speak of unique background configurations .",
    "we will discover that , although the boundary conditions are originally taken from a self - dual bps configuration , depending on discrete values of the size parameter @xmath6 , these solutions can have either pure magnetic monopole or dyonic ( self - dual ) character . for simplicity , let us call them in the first case _ hp monopole _ ( because of the suppressed electric components ) , in the second one _ bps monopole _ or simply _",
    "dyon_. our main interest is to investigate for the finite temperature case how usual indicators of the deconfinement phase transition ( average polyakov line , distribution of polyakov lines ) are modified by the presence of the different kinds of background fields . for this purpose",
    "we have to consider these observables locally , sufficiently far from the ` cold walls ' of the box .",
    "our main result will be that the self - dual bps - like ( dyon ) background fields  in contrast to the pure magnetic hp monopole ones  strongly support confinement .",
    "we shall show that a dyon invironment keeps the yang - mills theory in the confinement state even for temperatures @xmath7 .    from the investigation of the field strength correlator",
    "@xcite it is known that self - dual semi - classical configurations seem to be essential in the confinement phase _ but only there_. investigations of wilson loops in the classical dyon background have shown that dyons give rise , at short distances , to a weak but confining quark - antiquark force of harmonic oscillator type ( super - confinement ) @xcite . notice that this is not the confining force at long distances described by the string tension or the magnetic confinement @xcite for space - like wilson loops at high temperature .",
    "with respect to the latter , a dense gas of magnetic monopoles at high temperatures could explain it .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in chapter 2",
    "we show how to discretize a continuum bps monopole ( dyon ) solution and how the classical lattice configurations compatible with dyonic boundary conditions can be classified interpolating between lattice hp monopoles and dyons . in chapter 3 we report on monte carlo simulations performed with fixed open spatial boundary conditions corresponding to hp monopole or dyon background fields at finite temperature .",
    "we measure the profile of the action density and polyakov line inside the box and establish the existence or absence of confinement .",
    "chapter 4 contains the conclusions .",
    "first let us discuss classical field configurations in a finite volume with fixed spatial boundary conditions .",
    "we consider a hypercubic lattice of size @xmath8 with periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction ( finite temperature @xmath9 ) and open boundary conditions in the three - space .",
    "the latter will be specified such that links being normal to the boundary and pointing outwards are inactive , i. e. can not contribute to the action .",
    "link variables tangential to the boundaries will be fixed to classical values given by a bps dyon configuration as defined in the following .",
    "we discretize a single bps dyon field being a static solution of the euclidean yang - mills equations of motion .",
    "its center be fixed at @xmath10 . for the lattice spacing @xmath11",
    "is assumed . on each time slice @xmath12 all active link variables @xmath13 , @xmath14 , are represented as follows : @xmath15 with @xmath16 for the bps dyon solution we have explicitely @xmath17 @xmath18 denotes the inverse core size of the dyon to be fixed lateron .",
    "the replacement @xmath19 transforms the dyon into an anti - dyon .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath20 @xmath21 for comparison , the asymptotic behaviour of an hp pure monopole solution ( which classically would be related to a sufficiently strong non - vanishing higgs potential and in the quantum case of pure @xmath0 gauge theory could be due to a dynamical screening of the electric field components ) is determined by @xmath22 it is immediately clear that at semi - asymptotic distances one can not distinguish between a classical bps dyon and a hp monopole if one replaces @xmath23 as has been shown by smit and van der sijs @xcite the dyon or monopole fields at the boundary have some further interesting properties .",
    "additionally to the abelian gauge symmetry with respect to transformations @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) the boundary fields periodic in @xmath26 exhibit a combined symmetry with respect to the gauge transformation @xmath27 and the shift @xmath28    both the shifts ( [ dyon_vs_mon ] ) and ( [ mu_period ] ) can be combined and let us expect a periodic behaviour in @xmath18 which allows to create boundary conditions compatible with a bps dyon as well as with a hp monopole .",
    "as far as on the hypercubic lattice we have no cylindric symmetry at the boundary we have to replace @xmath29 by an effective @xmath30 , for which we adopt the value @xmath31 as given in @xcite . in what follows we shall parametrize the boundary values by @xmath32 instead of @xmath18 .    in general , one can not expect the lattice discretized dyon to be a solution of the _ lattice equations of motion_. in order to find such a solution corresponding to the dyon boundary conditions we keep the tangential boundary links fixed at the classical values given by ( [ dyon1 ] , [ dyon2 ] ) . for varying @xmath33 or @xmath34 , respectively",
    ", the other links inside the box ( for all time slices ) are exposed to repeated cycles of monte carlo heating followed by cooling .",
    "these links possess the form ( [ dyon1 ] , [ dyon2 ] ) only as start values .",
    "we wanted to find out , what lattice fields , respecting the boundary conditions augmented by periodicity in time , have minimal action .",
    "it turned out that there exist _ several local _ minima of action for @xmath34 sufficiently big .",
    "the configurations with lowest action show the interesting @xmath35-dependence anticipated above .    in order to characterize the lattice field configurations obtained by cooling after heating the discretized bps dyon",
    "we will use the full plaquette action @xmath36 with its magnetic part @xmath37 coming from the sum of space - space plaquette contributions and its electric part @xmath38 obtained as the sum of time - like plaquettes .",
    "1 shows the full action per timeslice of the classical continuum bps dyon , lattice discretized according to ( [ dyon1 ] , [ dyon2 ] ) , in dependence on the parameter @xmath39 ( solid line ) .",
    "the action values are given in units of @xmath40 .",
    "the lattice size is @xmath41 .",
    "obviously , for @xmath42 the dyon core parameter becomes sufficiently large such that this dyon completely fits into the lattice box .",
    "the data points in fig . 1 show the global or local minima , respectively , found for the full action ( asterisks ) after cooling down the monte carlo heated configurations . only in the range @xmath43 ( i.e. for a sufficiently smooth discretized original dyon field ( [ dyon1 ] , [ dyon2 ] ) )",
    "the action is practically reproduced . for larger @xmath35-values ( less than 1.5 )",
    "the solutions of the lattice equations of motion deviate from the original discretized dyon but are still unique in the sense that they are restored after repeated heating and cooling .",
    "these solutions exhibit the periodicity in @xmath44 as discussed before .",
    "for @xmath45 we have seen also other branches of solutions with higher action than the lowest possible one which are metastable under cooling .",
    "in addition to the full action , the magnetic ( open squares ) and electric contributions ( full dots ) to the action are shown separately .",
    "the most interesting for us are the states reached at half - integer and integer @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath46 we reproduce a bps dyon state identical to the original one at @xmath47 with equal electric and magnetic contributions to the action . for @xmath48",
    "only the magnetic part of the action survives .",
    "that means that we have obtained purely magnetic , hp - like monopoles .",
    "we convinced ourselves that we have obtained static solutions with localized action and topological charge ( the latter for the bps dyon only ) .",
    "as an example we show the action density profile for the case @xmath49 being a pure hp - monopole ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    in order to see what seems to be important of the boundary fields for the classes of lattice solutions we have found and for the classification below of the quantum fields on these background fields we compute the polyakov line .",
    "3 shows the polyakov line averaged over spatial points @xmath50 on the boundary , where the fields are kept at classical ( discretized ) bps dyon values , as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "we see the periodicity in @xmath34 again . for integer values @xmath39 , where inside the box hp monopoles are supported as classical solutions",
    ", we have @xmath51 . on the contrary for half - integer @xmath34 providing bps dyon solutions @xmath52 .",
    "( small deviations of the positions of the minima from @xmath53 and @xmath54 are due to an uncomplete optimization of the @xmath55-value on @xmath56 in the definition of @xmath39 . )",
    "in the following we want to investigate quantum fields with fixed spatial boundary conditions as given by the ansatz ( [ dyon1 ] , [ dyon2 ] ) .",
    "we call the latter simply _ dyon boundary conditions_. but we should keep in mind that these boundary conditions for appropriate values of @xmath34 are compatible to classical bps dyon or hp monopole solutions of the lattice equations of motion .",
    "we emphasize that these solutions are stable .",
    "this provides the opportunity to study a real semi - classical situation with a unique background field parametrized by @xmath35 .",
    "all our present work refers to @xmath0 pure gauge theory on a thermal ( non - symmetric ) lattice as a function of @xmath57 and @xmath34 .",
    "the simulations have been done with a standard monte carlo metropolis algorithm . for comparison",
    ", we have also done simulations at the same @xmath57 values on the same lattices with periodic boundary conditions . for the simulations ,",
    "the lattice size has been @xmath58 .",
    "remember that for @xmath59 the deconfinement phase transition occurs at @xmath60 @xcite . in the following",
    "we will mainly consider two typical cases : @xmath61 , characteristic for the confinement phase , and @xmath62 , for the deconfinement phase .    in order to estimate the range of influence of the dyon boundary condition on the quantum fields we computed different local observables for various @xmath35 as a function of the ( minimal ) distance @xmath63 from the lattice site to the boundary .",
    "4 and 5 show the plaquette contributions to the magnetic and electric part of the action averaged over all plaquettes with a given distance @xmath63 .",
    "the situation for both typical @xmath57-values looks quite similar . inside the box",
    "we obtain plateau values .",
    "the range of the plateau seems to define a core size of normal quantum fluctuations .",
    "we shall investigate the properties of the quantum fields inside the core in detail .",
    "there at least no difference is seen between magnetic and electric contributions to the action .",
    "we have computed the average polyakov line as a function of @xmath63 , too .",
    "this quantity is able to tell more about the influence of the type of boundary condition on the quantum fields in the interior of the box .",
    "the results are plotted in figs . 6 and 7 , respectively . even inside the core",
    "established before ( roughly at @xmath64 ) the behaviour of the polyakov line strongly depends on the boundary conditions compatible either with bps dyon or with hp monopole background fields .",
    "for integer @xmath39 ( hp monopole ) in both the confinement and the deconfinement phase the results are compatible with the one obtained for periodic boundary conditions at the same @xmath57 .",
    "that means that the interior of the lattice is in the phase corresponding to the @xmath57 value . for @xmath65 , in the presence of monopole boundary conditions , the small deviation ( in the center of the lattice ) from the expected zero is only due to the maximal violation of the @xmath66 invariance right on the spatial boundary ( compare with fig .",
    "3 ) .    for @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "7 ) we show the average polyakov line for periodic boundary conditions in a symmetrized way .",
    "in fact , during our relatively short simulation runs of typically @xmath68 configurations with @xmath69 empty sweeps we did not observe any tunneling between the @xmath66-symmetric states . in the presence of monopole boundary conditions , going deeper into the lattice the locally averaged polyakov line approaches the two @xmath66-symmetric values . on the contrary , for half - integer @xmath39 ( bps dyon )",
    "the average polyakov line remains zero throughout the whole lattice when passing the deconfinement transition . at @xmath67 inside the core",
    "we clearly get @xmath70 .",
    "these observations are supported by the corresponding histograms of local polyakov line values measured at distance @xmath71 from the boundary which are shown in figs . 8 and 9 for @xmath65 and @xmath72 , respectively .    in the confinement phase , the histograms corresponding to the monopole b.c .",
    "are displaced representing entirely the effect of the finite correlation length of the polyakov line , while the histogram for the dyonic boundary conditions coincides with the normal one ( for periodic boundary conditions ) . in the deconfinement",
    "phase the normal histogram ( without tunneling as in our case ) is reproduced with monopole boundary conditions at distance @xmath71 , while the histogram for dyonic boundary conditions is almost symmetric , similar to the lower @xmath57-value .",
    "we conclude that , while the hp monopole b.c .",
    "are compatible also with the confinement phase , a bps dyon background inside the finite box keeps the system in the confinement state even for temperatures above @xmath73 .",
    "but as we have seen for smaller @xmath74 or larger @xmath57 , this does not persist at arbitrarily high temperature .",
    "we checked this for @xmath75 ( compare fig .",
    "10 ) and @xmath76 .",
    "in both cases of boundary conditions we have obtained polyakov averages inside the corresponding core regions , being compatible with the case of periodic boundaries , i.e. deconfinement states .",
    "therefore , at larger temperatures deconfinement is restored inside the box in spite of the dyon boundary condition .",
    "we have investigated pure @xmath0 lattice gauge theory at finite temperatures .",
    "we have imposed fixed spatial boundary conditions defined by a discretized static bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield monopole or dyon solution of the continuum yang - mills field equations . by minimizing the lattice action we have found stable field configurations which solve the lattice equations of motion . as already reported by smit and van der sijs @xcite these configurations",
    "can be self - dual bps - like dyon or pure magnetic hp - like monopole solutions .",
    "they occur periodically in terms of the core size of the original dyon as fixed at the spatial boundary .",
    "as far as these configurations are really stable , i.e. repeated cycles of monte carlo heating and subsequent cooling provide always the same result , we are in a position to simulate the quantum theory in well - defined classical background fields .",
    "we have used this environment to find out , how dyon - like or purely magnetic , monopole - like background fields influence the finite temperature quantum fields .",
    "our main observation was that in the dyon - case the fields inside the box are kept in the confinement state even for higher temperatures , which in the standard case of periodic boundary conditions cause deconfinement .",
    "the polyakov line as the main order parameter for the deconfinement transition turned out to be zero remarkably stable inside the whole @xmath1 volume considered .",
    "however , a further increase of the temperature finally restored the deconfinement inside the @xmath1 box . the phenomenon reported here might be called _ delay of confinement evaporation _ due to dyon boundary conditions .",
    "we would like to interprete our findings such that the confinement phenomenon is stronger related to self - dual semi - classical objects like bps dyons than to a pure magnetic hp monopole background . on the other hand , deconfinement , when described semi - classically , requires background fields which are not ( anti- ) self - dual .",
    "the final loss of confinement above @xmath77 means breakdown of semi - classical approximation .",
    "this supports the view developed in recent papers , where the correlation between instantons and monopoles has been investigated in detail on the lattice ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the idea that dyons might provide confinement within a semi - classical framework has been put forward also within the continuum approach @xcite .",
    "our results were obtained for quite small lattice sizes .",
    "we are going to check them deeper in the continuum limit and for physically larger box volumes .",
