    "the degree of a graph generally corresponds to the amount of branching that does not occur at the basepoint .",

    "an _ extended branch _ is a downward path from @xmath111 that ends at a critical point .",
    "the primary difference between branches and extended branches is that branches only intersect at critical points while two or more extended branches can intersect on edges .",

    "canonical splitting_. this process is canonical ; we can start at the top of the graph , working downward , contracting each such edge .",
    "these contractions have the effect of splitting extended branches down to the next critical point , or perhaps all of the way down to the basepoint .",
    "canonical splitting can not increase the degree of a graph and decreases degree each time an edge collapse causes an extended branch to reach the basepoint .",
