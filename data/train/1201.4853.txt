    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite has recently emerged as a strong candidate for a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "one of the main motivations for such a theory is to provide a solution to the big - bang singularity .",
    "even when the full theory has still little to say about the initial singularity , a symmetry reduced theory , namely loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite , has been extremely successful at providing precise answers to that question .",
    "the theory is constructed by applying the methods of lqg to a symmetry reduced sector of general relativity . as examples of these reduced configurations",
    ", several authors have studied cosmological models with a massless scalar field and geometrically isotropic @xcite , homogeneous and anisotropic @xcite , and some inhomogeneous cosmologies @xcite .",
    "the common theme among these models is that they resolve the big bang singularity .",
    "the way singularity resolution occurs is by means of physical observables ( in the sense of dirac ) whose expectation values ( or spectrum ) have been shown to be bounded @xcite .",
    "these results benefit from uniqueness results that guaranty the consistency of the so called  improved dynamics \" @xcite .    in a sense ,",
    "isotropic lqc can be seen as a realization of one of the main objective of lqg , namely , to solve the big - bang singularity . in this case",
    "the singularity is replaced by a bounce that occurs precisely when the matter density enters the planck regime . at this energy density ,",
    "the quantum effects create a repulsive force , the would - be singularity is avoided and the resulting ` quantum ' spacetime is larger than one might be led to believe . as has been shown in detail , when the density decreases , the state very quickly leaves this quantum regime , and the universe returns to being well described by general relativity @xcite . with the final goal in mind of investigating the most general issue of singularity resolution within lqg ,",
    "one expects to gain useful insights from results obtained for less symmetric models .",
    "the simplest such model is given by bianchi i cosmologies @xcite where no spatial curvature exists . even for this case we do not possess yet a full exact evolution of the quantum equations of motion .    for both isotropic and anisotropic models ,",
    "a very useful tool has been the use of the so - called effective description , a ` classical theory ' ( in the sense that it does not contain @xmath0 ) that has information about the geometric discreetness contained in loop quantum gravity . in isotropic models , the solutions to the effective equations have been shown to approximate the dynamics of semiclassical states in the full quantum theory with very good accuracy @xcite . in the case of anisotropic models",
    "we also expect that the effective solutions play an important role for describing the evolution of semiclassical states .",
    "thus , we shall adopt the viewpoint that it is justified to study the effective dynamics for those cosmological models , as a way to learn about the full ` loopy ' quantum dynamics .",
    "so far , the only anisotropic model that has been explored in detail , through the so called _ effective equations _ , is the lqc bianchi i model @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to explore this issue for more complicated anisotropic models . in this paper",
    "we will study the effective equations obtained from the `` improved '' lqc dynamics of the bianchi ii model @xcite .",
    "the bianchi ii cosmological model represents the simplest case that posses spatial curvature , from which the bianchi i model can be recovered when a parameter measuring the spatial curvature contribution is ` switched off ' .",
    "the bianchi ii model possesses another interesting feature , namely , it lies at the heart of the belinskii , khalatnikov , lifshitz ( bkl ) conjecture @xcite , which suggest that , as one approaches space - like singularities , the behavior of the system undergoes bianchi i phases with bianchi ii transitions .",
    "one question that remains open though is whether this bkl behavior will survive in the effective theory .",
    "that is , will the oscillations between bianchi i phases occur far from the planck scale ? or will the loop - geometric effects prevent this ` mixmaster ' behavior to manifest itself ? from this point of view , it is important to study in detail the bianchi ii solutions .",
    "the most natural strategy to gain this intuition is to perform a systematic study of the solutions to the effective equations , under the assumption that they describe correctly the quantum dynamics .",
    "but even if the effective solutions do not describe correctly the quantum dynamics of the semiclassical states in some regime , we need to study them in detail in order to compare them to the full quantum dynamics when available and prove their validity .",
    "one can also expect that this study will shed some light on the larger issue of understanding generic space - like singularities in lqg .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study in a systematic way the space of solutions of the effective equations . the matter source that we shall consider is a massless scalar field that plays the role of internal time .",
    "the objective is to understand the singularity resolution , the asymptotic behavior and the relation between the bianchi ii and bianchi i models .",
    "the strategy will be to take limiting cases and compare them with known solutions .",
    "this will allow us to understand the new insights of the bianchi ii model .",
    "all the information will come from the set of observables that we define , namely , directional scale factors , hubble parameters , expansion , matter density , density parameter , shear , shear parameter , ricci scalar , curvature parameter and kasner exponents . with these tools in hand",
    "we shall compare the classical and the effective solutions .",
    "later on , the isotropic limit will offer interesting new insights into the bianchi ii dynamics , while the bianchi i limit will allow us to confirm that our solutions agree with the previous results of @xcite .",
    "the symmetry reduction to the locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) bianchi ii model will give us a way to find generic solutions with maximal density , at the bounce , larger than the critical density derived in the isotropic case @xcite .",
    "further , the vacuum limit will allows us to study the extreme solutions where all the dynamical contributions come from the anisotropies . finally , due to the fact that our work is numerical",
    "we will show that our solutions converge and evolve on the constraint surface .",
    "the convergence is an important issue that needs to be shown , because one needs to ensure that the numerical methods are well implemented , and that the numerical solutions converge to the analytical solutions .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we recall the classical theory in metric and connection variables , together with the basic observables to be studied . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce the effective theory and compute its equations of motion .",
    "numerical solutions are explored in sec .",
    "iv , where they are systematically studied taking the classical , isotropic , bianchi i , maximal density and vacuum limits .",
    "we end with a discussion in sec .",
    "v. there is one appendix where we study the convergence and evolution of the conserved quantities . throughout the manuscript",
    "we assume units where @xmath1 , the other constants are written explicitly .",
    "the metric for a bianchi ii model can be written as [ metric ] s^2= -n()^2 ^2 + a_1()^2(x - zy)^2+a_2()^2y^2+a_3()^2z^2 , where the parameter @xmath2 allows us to distinguish between bianchi i ( @xmath3 ) and bianchi ii ( @xmath4 ) cases .",
    "bianchi i cosmological solutions are also interesting , since they give information about the asymptotic behavior of bianchi ii .",
    "classically , the bianchi i case with a massless scalar field has solutions given by @xcite , [ metric_bi ] s^2= - t^2 + t^2k_1x^2 + t^2k_2y^2 + t^2k_3z^2 the so - called _ jacobs stiff perfect fluid solutions_. here , the parameters @xmath5 are known as the _ kasner exponents _ satisfying @xmath6 ( the minus sign is inserted , for future reference , as we want to take into account the change of direction of the expansion at the bounce ) and @xmath7 . in the literature , a massless scalar field is also known as `` stiff matter , '' and satisfies the equation of state @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is pressure and @xmath10 is the energy density .",

    "_ pancake _ type singularity . in this case",
    ", @xmath21 and @xmath22 approaches a finite value as @xmath13 ( cyclic on 1,2,3 ) .",
    "this kind of singularity is _ not _ realized in the jacobs solutions ( nor the bianchi ii with a massless scalar field , or `` stiff '' matter ) @xcite .",
    "this can be understood easily .",
    "this singularity happens when @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( cyclic on 1,2,3 ) in the bianchi i case , satisfying the constraint equations : @xmath25 that gives @xmath26 .",
    "now , the condition @xmath7 implies that @xmath27 , which means that there is no matter .",
    "thus , this type of singularity is not possible if there is stiff matter present .    these names for",
    "the different types of singularities , introduced by thorne in @xcite , refer to the change of the shape of a spherical element as the singularity is approached .",
    "the jacobs solutions will be useful in our analysis , since bianchi ii is past and future asymptotic to bianchi i ( see , for instance @xcite and section 9.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , bianchi ii is a limiting case for the effective equations of bianchi ii that come from its quantization @xcite in the loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) framework .",
    "then , in the classical region , bianchi i ( jacobs ) solutions are limiting cases for the effective bianchi ii that arises from lqc . + we will now rewrite the classical theory in terms of triads and connections in order to connect with the effective theory that comes from the quantum theory .",
    "to do this we use the fiducial triads and co - triads and introduce a convenient parametrization of the phase space variables , @xmath28 given by e^a_i = p_i l_i v_0 ^ -1 ^a_i a_a^i = c_i l_i^-1_a^i , without sum over @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the fiducial volume and @xmath31 the fiducial lengths with respect to the fiducial metric @xmath32 with co - triads _ a^1 = ( x)_a -z(y)_a , _",

    "the derivative respect to the cosmic time will be denoted by @xmath48 , then @xmath49 . from the equations of motion",

    "<S> we numerically investigate the solutions to the effective equations of the bianchi ii model within the  improved \" loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the matter source is a massless scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a systematic study of the space of solutions , and focus on the behavior of several geometrical observables . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the big - bang singularity is replaced by a bounce and the point - like singularities do not saturate the energy density bound . </S>",
    "<S> there are up to three directional bounces in the scale factors , one global bounce in the expansion , the shear presents up to four local maxima and can be zero at the bounce . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for solutions with density larger than the maximal density for the isotropic and bianchi i cases . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic behavior is shown to behave like that of a bianchi i model , and the effective solutions connect anisotropic solutions even when the shear is zero at the bounce . </S>",
    "<S> all known facts of bianchi i are reproduced . in the  vacuum limit \" , solutions are such that almost all the dynamics is due to the anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> since bianchi ii plays an important role in the bianchi ix model and the belinskii , khalatnikov , lifshitz ( bkl ) conjecture , our results can provide an intuitive understanding of the behavior in the vicinity of general space - like singularities , when loop - geometric corrections are present . </S>"
