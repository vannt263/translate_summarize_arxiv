    "the study of heavy quarkonium production is particularly interesting because it may provide decisive information in understanding hadronization of heavy quarks and gluons in qcd .",
    "the most widely accepted theory to describe heavy quarkonium production at present is nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization @xcite , in which the production is factorized into perturbative calculable short - distance coefficients and nonperturbative ( and universal ) long - distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) . as short - distance coefficients can be expanded in strong - coupling @xmath7 and each ldme has a definite power in @xmath8 ( the velocity of heavy quarks in the rest frame of heavy quarkonium ) , nrqcd factorization gives predictions by double expansion in @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "nrqcd factorization is efficient such that in principle only a finite number of universal parameters , which can be determined by using some known experimental data , are involved with required precision in predicting other production processes .",
    "although a complete proof of factorization is still lacking , at least it holds up to next - to - next - to - leading order in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "based on nrqcd factorization , charmonium production in hadron colliders has been studied extensively in recent years@xcite . specifically , for @xmath10 hadroproduction , it is found that all data at large @xmath11 , including both yield and polarization , can be well described by nrqcd factorization if one chooses a large @xmath12 and a small @xmath13 @xcite ( see also refs.@xcite ) .",
    "here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are linear combinations of related ldmes which are defined in refs.@xcite and will also be mentioned below , and roughly speaking , their values represent the importance of @xmath14 behavior and @xmath15 behavior in @xmath10 production cross sections , respectively .",
    "there are reasons that studying bottomonium may be a more suitable choice than charmonium to test the nrqcd factorization formalism .",
    "first , the value of @xmath9 is smaller in bottomonium ( @xmath16 ) than that in charmonium ( @xmath17 ) , thus the expansion in @xmath9 should converge faster in bottomonium .",
    "second , the mass of bottomonium is about 3 times of that of charmonium , then asymptotic freedom implies the convergence of @xmath18 expansion is also better in bottomonium .",
    "however , on the experiment side , the situation is not so satisfactory as the production rates of bottomonium are much smaller than charmonium , e.g. , the cross section of @xmath0 is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , there are more excited bottomonium states which are below the open bottom ( say @xmath19 ) threshold and can decay into lower bottomonium states such as @xmath0 with large branching ratios and consequently contribute a substantial fraction to the lower bottomonium inclusive production by the so - called feed - down contributions , thus it is hard to measure the direct production from the prompt inclusive production . in the lhc era , we expect these disadvantages may be overcome by the higher luminosity , thus testing nrqcd factorization by bottomonium production seems to be hopeful .",
    "the inclusive differential cross section and polarization of @xmath20 are measured at the tevatron @xcite , but the @xmath0 polarizations observed by d0 @xcite and cdf @xcite disagree with each other .",
    "furthermore , both the d0 and cdf measurements contradict the lo nrqcd prediction @xcite .",
    "as argued in refs.@xcite , the next - to - next - to - leading order and even higher - order contributions @xcite may not be important , as compared with the full next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd contributions including both color - singlet ( cs ) and color - octet ( co ) channels , which are essential in understanding the @xmath20 ( and similarly the @xmath10 ) hadroproduction . partial nlo qcd contributions to @xmath20 hadroproduction have been calculated recently @xcite , and it is found that the nlo qcd corrections of s - wave co channels only slightly change the transverse momentum distribution and the polarization , while the correction of cs channel may bring on significant enhancement to the momentum distribution and change the polarization from transverse at lo into longitudinal at nlo .",
    "but the nlo contributions of p - wave channels for @xmath20 hadroproduction are still missing .    at the lhc",
    ", cms has published the first run data for @xmath20 production @xcite , and lhcb has also reported the measured result @xcite .",
    "thus it is timely to present a complete nlo theoretical prediction for @xmath20 production , and compare theory with experiment . in this work ,",
    "we study the @xmath0 hadroproduction in the framework of nrqcd , including all nlo contributions and feed - down contributions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly introduce our calculation in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] .",
    "then in sec .",
    "[ sec : feeddown ] , we describe our method for taking into account the feed - down contributions .",
    "( note that the feed - down contributions for @xmath0 have not been treated seriously in all previous theoretical works . ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] , we fit data to determine ldmes and then give predictions for the lhc experiment . finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the method of nlo calculation used in this work is similar to that used in @xmath10 and @xmath21 production @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we will sketch it in this section .    according to the nrqcd factorization formalism",
    ", the inclusive cross section for direct bottomonium @xmath22 production in hadron - hadron collisions is expressed as @xmath23&=\\sum\\limits_{n}d\\hat{\\s}[(b\\bar{b})_n]\\dfrac{\\moh}{m_b^{2l_n}}\\\\ & = \\sum\\limits_{i , j , n}\\int dx_1 dx_2 g_{i / p}g_{j / p } \\times d\\hat{\\s}[i+j\\rightarrow ( b\\bar{b})_n + x]\\moh , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is either a proton or an antiproton , the indices @xmath25 run over all the partonic species , and @xmath26 denote the color , spin and angular momentum ( @xmath27 ) of the intermediate @xmath28 states . in this work ,",
    "we calculate the cross sections up to @xmath29 corrections , so that the intermediate states include @xmath30}_1 $ ] , @xmath31}_j$ ] , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "note that our definition of cs ldmes @xmath35})\\rangle}$ ] and @xmath36})\\rangle}$ ] are different from that in ref .",
    "@xcite by a factor of @xmath37 .",
    "the calculation proceeds with three steps : calculating the parton level differential cross section @xmath38 $ ] , integrating over the phase space , and fitting the ldmes .",
    "nlo corrections for the parton level differential cross section include virtual corrections and real corrections . for virtual corrections , we use feynarts @xcite to generate feynman diagrams and amplitudes .",
    "we then calculate these thousands feynman diagrams analytically using our self - written mathematica code .",
    "finally , we output the simplified expression into c++ code . because the infrared divergence will appear when doing phase space integration for the real correction , we use the two cutoff phase space slicing method @xcite to isolate the divergence .",
    "the contributions from the singular phase space part are calculated analytically , while finite parts are calculated by using the berends - giele off - shell recursive relations @xcite .",
    "in the analytical calculation we have checked that all the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) singularities are canceled exactly .",
    "the uv divergences are removed by renormalization .",
    "the ir singularities arising from loop integration and phase space integration of the real correction partially cancel each other .",
    "the remaining ir singularities are absorbed into the proton parton - distribution functions and the nrqcd ldmes .",
    "the numerical integration over the phase space is handled by our self - written c++ codes , where we also use both qcdloop @xcite and looptools @xcite to calculate the scalar functions in the virtual corrections numerically .",
    "we verified that our results are independent of the two cuts introduced by the phase space slicing method .",
    "the method of fitting ldmes will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] .",
    "one difficulty in predicting @xmath20 production cross section is the treatment of feed - down contribution .",
    "there are several higher excited states that can decay into @xmath39 and they include : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . unfortunately , there are not enough data to determine ldmes of these higher excited states , therefore , it is hard to predict their feed - down contributions to @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , all previous predictions that were based on nrqcd factorization did not have a serious treatment of the feed - down contributions .    the key point to deal with feed - down contribution",
    "is to determine the relation between momentum of higher excited states and momentum of @xmath39 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find a very good approximation that the ratio of two momenta is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses .",
    "notice that the mass differences between these excited states and @xmath39 are of the order of @xmath46 and @xmath9 is very small in bottomonium , as a result , unlike the @xmath10 case , the momentum shift can be ignored when these excited states decay into @xmath39 . hence the production ldmes can be approximately combined into 6 independent ones : @xmath47})\\rangle}=&{\\langle\\mathcal{o}^{{\\upsilon(1s)}}(\\bigl.^3\\hspace{-1mm}s_1^{[1]})\\rangle }    + \\sum_{n=2,3}{\\langle\\mathcal{o}^{{\\upsilon(ns)}}(\\bigl.^3\\hspace{-1mm}s_1^{[1]})\\rangle}\\br({\\upsilon(ns)}\\rightarrow{\\upsilon(1s)}),\\\\    { \\langle\\mathcal{o}^{}(\\bigl.^3\\hspace{-1mm}p_1^{[1]})\\rangle}= &    \\sum_{n=1,2}{\\langle\\mathcal{o}^{{\\chi_{b1}(np)}}(\\bigl.^3\\hspace{-1mm}p_1^{[1]})\\rangle}\\br({\\chi_{b1}(np)}\\rightarrow{\\upsilon(1s)}),\\\\    { \\langle\\mathcal{o}^{}(\\bigl.^3\\hspace{-1mm}p_2^{[1]})\\rangle}= &    \\sum_{n=1,2}{\\langle\\mathcal{o}^{{\\chi_{b2}(np)}}(\\bigl.^3\\hspace{-1mm}p_2^{[1]})\\rangle}\\br({\\chi_{b2}(np)}\\rightarrow{\\upsilon(1s)}),\\\\    { \\langle\\mathcal{o}^{}(\\bigl.^3\\hspace{-1mm}s_1^{[8]})\\rangle}=&{\\langle\\mathcal{o}^{{\\upsilon(1s)}}(\\bigl.^3\\hspace{-1mm}s_1^{[8]})\\rangle }    + \\sum_{n=2,3}{\\langle\\mathcal{o}^{{\\upsilon(ns)}}(\\bigl.^3\\hspace{-1mm}s_1^{[8]})\\rangle}\\br({\\upsilon(ns)}\\rightarrow{\\upsilon(1s)})\\\\    & + \\sum_{n=1,2}\\sum_{j=1,2}{\\langle\\mathcal{o}^{{\\chi_{bj}(np)}}(\\bigl.^3\\hspace{-1mm}s_1^{[8]})\\rangle}\\br({\\chi_{bj}(np)}\\rightarrow{\\upsilon(1s)}),\\\\    { \\langle\\mathcal{o}^{}(\\bigl.^1\\hspace{-1mm}s_0^{[8]})\\rangle}=&{\\langle\\mathcal{o}^{{\\upsilon(1s)}}(\\bigl.^1\\hspace{-1mm}s_0^{[8]})\\rangle }    + \\sum_{n=2,3}{\\langle\\mathcal{o}^{{\\upsilon(ns)}}(\\bigl.^1\\hspace{-1mm}s_0^{[8]})\\rangle}\\br({\\upsilon(ns)}\\rightarrow{\\upsilon(1s)}),\\\\    { \\langle\\mathcal{o}^{}(\\bigl.^3\\hspace{-1mm}p_0^{[8]})\\rangle}=&{\\langle\\mathcal{o}^{{\\upsilon(1s)}}(\\bigl.^3\\hspace{-1mm}p_0^{[8]})\\rangle }    + \\sum_{n=2,3}{\\langle\\mathcal{o}^{{\\upsilon(ns)}}(\\bigl.^3\\hspace{-1mm}p_0^{[8]})\\rangle}\\br({\\upsilon(ns)}\\rightarrow{\\upsilon(1s ) } ) .",

    "in summary , we calculate the complete nlo corrections for the @xmath0 production at hadron colliders up to @xmath57 . ignoring corrections of higher - orders in @xmath9 , we combine the production ldmes of @xmath0 and other excited states into 3 color - singlet ldmes and 3 color - octet ldmes .",
    "these 6 ldmes are approximately universal and they include almost all feed - down contributions to @xmath0 production .",
    "the cs ldmes are estimated by using potential model results , while the co ldmes are determined by fitting the tevatron data .",
    "then we find our predictions well coincide with the new experimental data at the lhc .",
    "our work may provide a new test for the universality of ldmes in @xmath0 hadroproduction .    to have a comprehensive understanding of @xmath0 hadroproduction , it is certainly important to also compare the theoretical result with the polarization data for @xmath0 ,",
    "we leave it as a further study . encouraged by the result of @xmath10 polarization @xcite , where we find the @xmath10 polarization and yield",
    "can be consistently explained by two well constrained co ldmes ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , a good description for the @xmath0 data including yield and polarization seems to be promising .",
    "however , note that the values of two well constrained co ldmes in @xmath10 production are significantly different @xcite , while for @xmath0 production we find from eq . that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are of the same order .",
    "another complexity concerns the influence of big feed - down contributions on @xmath0 polarization .",
    "therefore , a full understanding of @xmath0 production including both yield and polarization may provide important information in addition to the study of @xmath10 production . on the experiment side , because the bottom quark is heavy : @xmath60 5 gev , to test the large @xmath11 ( @xmath61 ) behavior one needs to measure the cross sections and polarizations at @xmath11 as large as , say 30 gev and even larger , with higher statistics , and to separate the higher excited @xmath3 production from the @xmath0 production .",
    "this is a hard task for experiment , and we hope it can be fulfilled at the lhc in the near future",
    ". then we can make more thorough comparison between theory and experiment , and provide a further test of nrqcd factorization .",
