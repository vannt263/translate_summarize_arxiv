    "recent work on the clustering properties of galaxies has focussed on the connection between galaxies and dark matter halos , using theoretical models of galaxy formation @xcite or observational data @xcite to determine the number of galaxies that reside within halos of given mass .",
    "models of this type have been successful in explaining the near power - law nature of the galaxy - galaxy correlation function @xcite , and the strong clustering of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath4 @xcite .    in this context , calculated the quantity @xmath0 , the probability of finding @xmath1 galaxies brighter than a specified luminosity , @xmath5 , in a dark matter halo of mass @xmath2 , from the galaxy - formation model of .",
    "this quantity is particularly powerful since , once a model for the distribution of dark - matter halos is chosen , @xmath0 fully determines all clustering properties of galaxies on scales larger than the size of dark matter halos ( on smaller scales the spatial distribution of galaxies within individual halos becomes important ) . as such ,",
    "@xmath0 may be thought of as a complete description of the galaxy  dark - matter bias including any non - linearity and stochasticity .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath0 can be measured from the observed clustering pattern of galaxies it provides a direct and powerful constraint for models of galaxy formation since it is sensitive to the merger history of dark - matter halos , and to the rate of galaxy - galaxy mergers within halos .    in this paper",
    "we describe how @xmath0 may be measured directly from a volume - limited galaxy - redshift survey by using a counts - in - cells analysis to determine the probability of finding @xmath1 galaxies in a cell , @xmath6 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is laid out as follows . in  [ sec : method ] we describe our method and give the formulae relating @xmath0 and @xmath6 for all @xmath1 . in  [ sec : mocks ] we investigate how well @xmath0 can be measured from a combination of the two micron all sky survey (; 2mass ) and two - degree field galaxy redshift survey (; 2dfgrs ) or sloan digital sky survey (; sdss ) datasets using the mock galaxy catalogues of , and finally in  [ sec : discuss ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we will assume that the galaxy population of a dark matter halo is determined only by the mass of that halo . whilst it is the distribution of halo masses which varies most significantly as a function of environment @xcite other quantities are also known to correlate with environment , for example the concentration of the halo @xcite .",
    "in practice the properties of galaxies may depend upon such variables thereby altering the clustering properties of the galaxies . in principle",
    ", other variables could be included in our analysis by defining a function @xmath7 , where @xmath8 represents other variables upon which the properties of galaxies may depend .",
    "however , current datasets are insufficient to allow meaningful measurements of such a function to be made and so we will restrict ourselves to considering @xmath0 only at present .",
    "we must also assume that @xmath9 for all @xmath10 ; i.e. halos below mass @xmath11 never contain any galaxies brighter than @xmath5 .",
    "this is a reasonable and necessary assumption  if halos of arbitrarily low mass could host bright galaxies then , since there are an infinite number of halos per unit volume ( at least according to the press - schechter theory ) there would be an infinite number of galaxies per unit volume . having made this assumption we can ignore halos of mass less than @xmath11 as they make no contribution to the galaxy population that we are considering .",
    "how may we determine @xmath11 for a given galaxy population ?",
    "one approach would be to make use of dynamical mass estimates ( e.g. ) . however , these are not available for all types of galaxy .",
    "an alternative method is to use galaxy samples selected at near - infrared wavelengths from which we can infer a stellar mass from the sample magnitude limit @xcite .",
    "then @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the stellar mass .",
    "this lower limit on @xmath11 corresponds to the case where the entire gaseous mass of a halo is turned into stars .",
    "the halo must have at least this mass to make the observed galaxy .",
    "the conversion from k - band light to stellar mass is uncertain by a factor of approximately two @xcite , so @xmath11 should realistically be taken to be two to three times lower than the value inferred from eqn .",
    "( [ eq : mzero ] ) .",
    "while any clustering statistic can be written in terms of @xmath0 and the clustering properties of dark matter halos ( for example , the two - point correlation function expressed in terms of @xmath0 is given in appendix  [ ap : xi ] ) a particularly simple relation can be found for @xmath6 , the probability of finding @xmath1 galaxies brighter than @xmath5 in a cell of given size and shape .",
    "while these statistics can in principle reveal @xmath0 for any @xmath1 and for a range of @xmath2 , in practice measurement is severely limited by unavoidable noise in the data as will be shown in ",
    "[ sec : mocks ] .",
    "nevertheless , useful constraints can still be obtained from this analysis . in the remainder of this section",
    "we develop the relations necessary to determine @xmath0 for all @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but will only make use of the simplest forms of these relations in  [ sec : mocks ] .",
    "the probability of finding @xmath1 galaxies in a cell of given size and geometry can be expressed in terms of the probability of finding a certain combination of halos in that cell and the probabilities of finding different numbers of galaxies in each of those halos . in order to measure @xmath0",
    "it is necessary to divide halos into a number of mass ranges , or bins .",
    "we will then refer to the mean value of @xmath0 averaged over all halos in mass bin @xmath14 as @xmath15 , such that @xmath15 is the probability of finding @xmath1 galaxies in a halo selected at random from mass bin @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the lower bound of the @xmath18 mass bin .",
    "let @xmath6 be the probability of finding @xmath1 galaxies in a cell ( of given size and geometry ) .",
    "for a particular choice of cosmology and dark matter let @xmath19 be the probability of finding the centres of @xmath20 halos in mass bin 1 , @xmath21 in bin 2 etc .",
    "in a cell , where we have used a total of @xmath22 mass bins .",
    "( we take the centre of mass to define the halo centre . )",
    "note that in general @xmath23 since the distribution of halos is typically correlated .",
    "note that @xmath6 is an observationally measurable quantity , and @xmath19 can be obtained from a structure formation model . as we show below",
    ", these two quantities are related , and that relation depends upon @xmath0 .",
    "measurement of @xmath6 therefore allows us to measure @xmath0 .",
    "we can write @xmath6 as the sum over all possible combinations of @xmath24 of @xmath19 multiplied by the probability of finding @xmath25 galaxies in the first halo , @xmath26 in the second etc .",
    "summed over all combinations of @xmath27 which satisfy the constraint @xmath28 ( i.e. only those combinations which produce the correct number of galaxies in the cell contribute to the total probability ) .    for example , @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 while @xmath31 and @xmath32 are given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of times a halo in mass bin @xmath14 is populated by @xmath36 galaxies and @xmath37 is the number of distinct permutations of each term which contribute to the probability .",
    "the weighting factor @xmath37 is the number of ways to populate the available halos with the galaxies divided by the number of times such terms appear in the summation . in general , @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "for example , @xmath40    as expected , @xmath6 depends only upon those @xmath41 for which @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , we may begin by finding the @xmath43 s using the expression for @xmath29 , then proceed to find the @xmath44 s using the expression for @xmath31 and the previously calculated @xmath43 and so on .",
    "each expression therefore involves @xmath22 unknowns ( for @xmath6 these are the @xmath15 ) , and so we must have a measure of @xmath6 for at least @xmath22 different cell sizes to solve the equations .",
    "while the above equations can not be solved analytically for the @xmath15 , solutions can be found relatively simply using powell s method @xcite to minimize the quantity @xmath45/\\delta s_i^{\\rm obs}(n))^2 $ ] for example , where the sum is taken over all cell sizes considered",
    ".    in general , the expression for @xmath6 will be of the form @xmath46 \\nonumber \\\\   & &   + \\hbox{3 halo terms } + \\hbox{4 halo terms } + \\ldots + n\\hbox { halo terms } \\big ) \\prod_{j=1}^n p_j^{n_j}(0 ) , \\label{eq : maineq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the expression `` @xmath1 halo terms '' refers to all terms corresponding to galaxies shared between @xmath1 different halos ( i.e. the first two sums in the above expression are therefore `` 1 halo terms '' and `` 2 halo terms '' ) .    at this point",
    "it is instructive to briefly consider the assumptions made in obtaining the above relations .",
    "firstly we have assumed that all galaxies lie at the centre of the halo they occupy .",
    "then , a halo being in a cell guarantees that any galaxies it contains are also in the cell . in reality",
    "galaxies are likely to be spread throughout the halo with some unknown spatial distribution , and so some galaxies may lie outside of the cell even though their halo centre is inside ( and conversely some galaxies may lie inside even though their halo centre is outside ) .",
    "while our analysis could be extended to account for such `` edge effects '' this would require us to assume a distribution for galaxies within individual halos .",
    "we prefer to concentrate on scales where these effects are negligible . in  [",
    "sec : mocks ] we demonstrate that edge effects are an insignificant source of error .",
    "secondly we assume that the galaxy occupancy of all halos in a mass bin is well described by a single set of @xmath15 .",
    "providing @xmath0 varies little across the mass bin this is a reasonable assumption .",
    "however , as we will see in  [ sec : mocks ] noisy data may limit us to considering a single mass bin , extending from @xmath11 to infinity , for which the above assumption is unlikely to hold true .",
    "while we implicitly assume that the @xmath15 are independent of the number of halos found in a cell the press - schechter @xcite formalism tells us that high density regions of the universe will contain preferentially higher mass halos than low density regions . consequently cells which contain many halos will preferentially contain high mass halos , while in cells containing few halos the halos are likely to be of low mass .",
    "if , for example , @xmath47 is a decreasing function of @xmath2 then cells with few halos ( which are typically the most abundant ) will contain zero galaxies more often than our model assumes .",
    "the resulting increase in @xmath29 can be seen in the synthetic datasets used in  [ sec : mocks ] .",
    "while this has a non - negligible effect on @xmath29 , particularly for large cell sizes , the value of @xmath48 recovered is quite insensitive to this since most of the signal comes from small cell sizes .",
    "perhaps the most suitable dataset to apply this technique to will be a combination of the 2mass survey with a large redshift survey ( e.g. the 2dfgrs or the sdss ) .",
    "the 2mass survey provides near - infrared photometry which allows @xmath11 to be estimated , but must be complemented by a redshift survey in order to provide a 3d map of the galaxy distribution .",
    "could be measured from a 2d dataset , the 3d information will provide a much stronger constraint . ] a volume limited 2mass sample of galaxies brighter than @xmath49 would have a volume of order @xmath50mpc@xmath51 in the 2dfgrs survey area ( or around four times this volume in the sdss survey area ) .",
    "as this is very similar to the volume of the gif @xmath52cdm n - body simulation used by we will use their synthetic galaxy catalogues to estimate how well @xmath0 could be recovered from such a dataset .",
    "we do not attempt here to reproduce the full details of the survey geometry or selection function , but merely consider a synthetic dataset with comparable volume and number density of galaxies in order to estimate the accuracy with which @xmath0 may be recovered from such a survey .",
    "we consider only galaxies brighter than @xmath49 to ensure that we need only consider halos which are well resolved by the gif simulation .",
    "these galaxies live in halos with masses greater than @xmath53 in this model ( the particle mass in the gif @xmath52cdm simulation is @xmath54 ) . inferring @xmath11 from the k - band magnitude of the galaxies we find @xmath55 .",
    "we therefore conservatively set @xmath56 .",
    "we consider only one bin of halo mass , i.e. all halos more massive than @xmath57 . while this technique can in principle be applied to several halo mass bins we find that in practice this is very difficult .",
    "typically the values of @xmath15 for the more massive bins are poorly constrained since there are very few halos in the mass range , or else the solutions of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : maineq ] ) for different cell sizes are degenerate in the @xmath15 s and so only allow certain combinations of @xmath15 s to be accurately measured .",
    "very large datasets , with correspondingly small errors may allow a measurement of @xmath15 in more than one mass bin , although this will probably require a treatment of edge effects which must eventually become the dominant source of error .",
    "we measure @xmath6 in cubic cells of side @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64mpc , and measure @xmath65 for the same cell sizes .",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath65 are calculated for galaxy / halo positions in redshift space .",
    "for smaller cubes edge effects begin to become a significant source of error , while for larger cubes the gif simulation contains very few independent volumes .",
    "the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sn ] shows @xmath65 for @xmath66 , 10 and @xmath67mpc , while the right - hand panel shows @xmath29 ( squares ) and @xmath68 ( crosses ) as functions of @xmath69 .",
    "errors are estimated assuming poisson statistics and that there are @xmath70 independent volumes in the simulation , where @xmath71mpc is the size of the gif @xmath52cdm simulation volume .",
    "this is known to underestimate the true errors ( e.g. ) , but is sufficient for our present purposes .",
    "note that placing all galaxies at the halo centre ( solid squares ) , or placing one galaxy at the centre and making satellite galaxies trace the dark matter of their halo ( open squares ) has little effect on the measured @xmath29 , i.e. edge effects are unimportant for this sample .",
    "for the smallest cells we consider @xmath68 accounts for around 65% of the value of @xmath29 , and makes a smaller contribution for the larger cells .",
    "also shown is the value of @xmath29 predicted by eqn .",
    "( [ eq : maineq ] ) with the recovered value of @xmath72 ( dashed line ) and the true value of @xmath72 ( solid line ) . for the larger cell sizes",
    "neither gives a good fit to the mock data points .",
    "this is due to the failure of our assumption that @xmath73 is roughly constant throughout the mass bin ( as discussed in  [ sec : method ] ) .",
    "however , as we discuss below this does not drastically alter the recovered values of @xmath74 .    we determine @xmath74 from the measured @xmath6 and @xmath65 by solving eqn .",
    "( [ eq : maineq ] ) for @xmath74 by minimizing @xmath75 ( as described in ",
    "[ sec : method ] ) . figure  [ fig : mockres ] shows the true @xmath74 as measured directly from the full model and from the gif synthetic galaxy catalogue ( solid squares and solid triangles respectively ) , with errorbars computed assuming poisson statistics , and the @xmath74 recovered from the synthetic galaxy catalogue via the @xmath6 s with all galaxies at their halo centre ( open triangles ) and with satellite galaxies tracing the dark matter of their halo ( open squares ) , with errorbars estimated from @xmath76 .",
    "the first three @xmath74 are recovered with reasonably accuracy from the synthetic galaxy catalogues .",
    "( for @xmath3 , 1 and 2 the recovered @xmath74 differ from the true values by 3% , 17% and 46% respectively , although we caution that these values are from a single realization of the synthetic galaxy catalogue and so may not be representative . )    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     a weakness of this approach is that the equation for @xmath15 depends upon all @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "hence , any errors in the determination of @xmath43 affect the estimate of @xmath44 etc . in the case of the synthetic galaxy catalogues used here we can recover @xmath74 accurately for @xmath79 .",
    "when we consider @xmath80 , however , we find that the contribution to @xmath81 from terms involving only @xmath72 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 already exceeds the measured value .",
    "thus the solution to the equation requires that @xmath80 be negative , which is of course impossible .",
    "thus with a dataset of this size only the first few @xmath74 can be measured .",
    "we have described how the distribution of galaxies amongst halos , as described by the function @xmath0 ( the probability of finding @xmath1 galaxies brighter than a specified luminosity @xmath5 in a halo of mass @xmath2 ) , can be measured directly from a galaxy redshift survey once a model for the spatial distribution of dark matter halos is assumed .",
    "specifically we derive relations between the observationally measurable quantity @xmath6 ( the probability of finding @xmath1 galaxies in a cell ) and the theoretically determinable quantity @xmath84 ( the probability of finding different numbers of dark - matter halos in a cell ) .",
    "these relations depend upon @xmath0 , thereby allowing @xmath0 to be determined from observational determinations of @xmath6 and a model of structure formation .",
    "the distribution function @xmath0 provides a complete description of galaxy bias ( at least on scales larger than the size of halos ) in terms of physically meaningful quantities and will also be sensitive to the merging history of dark matter halos and the rate of galaxy - galaxy mergers within dark matter halos .",
    "we have presented the technique in its simplest form .",
    "we defer a more detailed study of errors ( including edge effects ) and the limitations imposed by the simplifying assumptions made to a future paper .",
    "our approach assumes a model for the underlying distribution of dark matter halos , and the results obtained will therefore be dependent on that model . measurements of key cosmological parameters , perhaps from measurements of the cosmic microwave background @xcite , and the dark matter power spectrum , from weak lensing ( e.g. ) or lyman-@xmath85 forest studies @xcite , in the near future should allow the halo distribution to be fully determined .    using the mock galaxy catalogues produced by we have shown that @xmath0 averaged over all halos more massive than @xmath57 is measurable for the first few values of @xmath1 from a combination of the 2mass dataset with a redshift survey such as the sdss or 2dfgrs . to measure @xmath0 for higher @xmath1 or as a function of @xmath2 would require larger datasets and a detailed consideration of edge effects .",
    "measurement of this quantity from forthcoming galaxy redshift surveys will therefore provide strong constraints for models of galaxy formation and clustering and reveal a great deal about the connection between galaxies and dark matter .",
    "we would like to thank marc kamionkowski for a careful reading of this work , carlton baugh , shaun cole , carlos frenk and cedric lacey for making available results from their galaxy formation model , simon white for useful discussions and the virgo consortium for making available the gif simulations used in this work .",
    "the two - point correlation function is a familiar clustering statistics easily expressed in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "suppose there is a halo of mass @xmath86 to @xmath87 in a small volume element @xmath88 .",
    "let @xmath89 be the probability of finding a halo of mass @xmath90 to @xmath91 in a small volume element @xmath92 a distance @xmath93 away from the first halo .",
    "we can write @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the cross correlation function of these halos . a single halo pair may contribute many galaxy pairs .",
    "on average the above halo pair will contribute @xmath96 galaxy pairs , where @xmath97 is the mean number of galaxies in a halo of mass @xmath2 .",
    "for a random distribution of galaxies we would expect @xmath98 integrating eqns .",
    "( [ eq : n12clus ] ) and ( [ eq : n12ran ] ) over all halo masses we find the total number of galaxy pairs in the clustered and random cases to be @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the mean number density of the galaxies .",
