    "the cluster variation method ( cvm ) is a powerful approximate technique for the statistical mechanics of lattice systems , which can improve the simple mean field and bethe theories , by taking into account correlations on larger and larger distances .",
    "it was first proposed by kikuchi in 1951  @xcite as an approximate evaluation of the thermodynamic weight of the system , and since then it has been reformulated several times  @xcite , mainly to clarify the nature of the approximation and to simplify the way to work it out .",
    "quite a recent formulation  @xcite shows that the cvm consists in a truncation of the cumulant entropy expansion .",
    "each cumulant is associated to a cluster of sites and the truncation is justified by the expected rapid vanishing of the cumulants upon increasing the cluster size . in this way the cvm can be viewed as a hierarchy of approximations ,",
    "each one defined by the set of maximal clusters retained in the cumulant expansion , usually denoted as basic clusters .",
    "if pairs of nearest neighbor sites are chosen as basic clusters , the cvm coincides with the bethe approximation .",
    "generally , using larger basic clusters improves the approximation , even if the convergence of the cumulant expansion to the exact entropy has been rigorously proved just in a few cases  @xcite .",
    "due to its relative simplicity and accuracy , the cvm is widely used in every kind of statistical mechanical applications , to determine both thermodynamic properties  @xcite and phase diagrams  @xcite .",
    "the cvm results generally compare well with those of monte carlo simulations  @xcite as well as experimental ones  @xcite . making use of suitable series of cvm approximations ,",
    "it is also possible to extrapolate quite accurate estimates of critical exponents  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the belief propagation algorithm , an approximate method for statistical inference , employed for a lot of technologically relevant problems ( image  @xcite and signal processing  @xcite , decoding of error - correcting codes  @xcite , machine learning  @xcite ) , is actually equivalent to the minimization of a bethe free energy for statistical mechanical models defined on graphs  @xcite .",
    "this fact has opened new research areas both to the application of the cvm as an improvement of the approximation  @xcite , and to the analysis of efficient minimization algorithms  @xcite , mainly due to the fact that belief propagation sometimes fails to converge .",
    "let us introduce the problem from the cvm point of view .",
    "once the approximate entropy ( and hence free energy ) for the chosen set of basic clusters has been obtained , one has to face the problem of minimizing a complicated non - convex functional in the basic cluster probability distributions .",
    "an algorithm for minimizing such a functional has been proposed by kikuchi himself  @xcite , and is known as natural iteration method ( nim ) .",
    "a proof of convergence of this algorithm has been given in the original paper , essentially for the bethe approximation , which can be easily extended to the husimi tree  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the range of convergent cases seems to be much wider , so that the natural iteration method might be interesting also for the non conventional applications mentioned above .    in this article",
    "we analyze a sufficient condition for the convergence of the nim .",
    "such a condition is a requirement on the coefficients of the cluster entropy expansion ( obtained from the cumulant expansion through a mbius inversion  @xcite ) and is shown to hold for quite a large variety of approximations that are generally used to treat thermodynamic systems .",
    "namely , we consider : a set of `` plaquette '' approximations on different lattices  @xcite , kikuchi s b  and c  hierarchies for the square  @xcite and triangular  @xcite lattices , the cube approximation for the simple cubic lattice . as far as the latter case is concerned , we actually analyze a generic hypercube approximation on the hypercubic lattice in @xmath0  dimensions , showing that the sufficient condition holds for @xmath1 .",
    "finally we take into account a recently proposed algorithm for the minimization of the cvm free energy  @xcite , which allows several alternatives , depending on the possibility of upperbounding the free energy with convex ( easy to be minimized ) functions .",
    "we show that one of the best choices is actually equivalent to the natural iteration method .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the approximate cvm entropy can be written as a linear combination of cluster entropies  @xcite @xmath2 where the sum index  @xmath3 runs over all basic clusters and their subclusters .",
    "we shall always consider clusters in this set only .",
    "the cluster entropies are defined as usual @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the probability of the configuration  @xmath6 for the cluster  @xmath3 , the sum runs over all possible configurations , and the boltzmann constant  @xmath7 is set to  @xmath8 ( entropy is measured in natural units ) .",
    "the coefficients can be determined recursively , starting from basic clusters down to subclusters , making use of the following property  @xcite @xmath9 due to the fact that a basic cluster  @xmath10 never contains ( by definition ) another basic cluster , from the above formula we immediately get @xmath11 . here and in the following",
    ", @xmath10 denotes basic clusters .",
    "as far as the hamiltonian is concerned , we assume that it can be written as a sum of contributions @xmath12 from all basic clusters as @xmath13 where of course @xmath14 denote basic cluster configurations .",
    "let us decide to write the whole cvm free energy as a sum over basic clusters , splitting entropy contributions from each subcluster among all basic clusters that contain it ( in equal parts ) .",
    "assuming energies normalized to @xmath15 , we obtain @xmath16 =    \\sum_{\\gamma }    \\sum_{x_\\gamma } p_\\gamma(x_\\gamma )    \\left [    h_\\gamma(x_\\gamma )    + \\log p_\\gamma(x_\\gamma )    + \\sum_{\\alpha \\subset \\gamma } b_\\alpha \\log p_\\gamma(x_\\alpha )    \\right ]    ,    \\label{eq : f1}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 let us notice that we have defined new coefficients @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the number of basic clusters that contain  @xmath3 , and we have expressed subcluster probability distributions as marginals of basic cluster distributions , according to eq .",
    "( the sum runs over configurations @xmath20 of the basic cluster @xmath10 minus the subcluster @xmath3 ) .",
    "in the above formulation , basic cluster distributions @xmath21 are the variational parameters of the free energy ( which is denoted in short by @xmath22 $ ] ) , and the thermodynamic equilibrium state can be determined by minimization with respect to these parameters with suitable normalization and compatibility constraints . by compatibility",
    "we mean of course that marginal distributions @xmath23 must be the same for all basic clusters @xmath24",
    ". let us notice that , for most thermodynamic applications , one usually makes some homogeneity assumption on the system , and this generally reduces the problem to only one or few different basic cluster distributions .",
    "compatibility constraints may be still necessary to impose the required symmetry .",
    "we go on with the complete formulation , without loss of generality .",
    "the important thing is that in any case we deal with constraints that are linear in the probability distributions ( compatibility ) , possibly with an additive constant ( unit ) term ( normalization ) .",
    "according to the lagrange method , we transform the constrained minimum problem with respect to @xmath21 to a free minimum problem for an extended functional which depends on additional parameters ( lagrange multipliers ) . due to linearity , the extended functional",
    "can be written in the form @xmath25 = f[p ]    - \\sum_{\\gamma } \\sum_{x_\\gamma } p_\\gamma(x_\\gamma ) \\lambda_\\gamma(x_\\gamma )    ,    \\label{eq : f2}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 are the lagrange multipliers .",
    "of course , @xmath26 are not all independent variables , but internal relationships are system dependent , and we do not analyze them .",
    "let us only notice , for future use , that the difference between the new functional and the original one ( the last term in eq .  ) is actually independent of the @xmath21 distributions , provided they satisfy the required constraints .",
    "the derivatives of  @xmath27 with respect to  @xmath28 turn out to be @xmath29}{\\partial p_\\gamma(x_\\gamma ) }    =    h_\\gamma(x_\\gamma )    + \\log p_\\gamma(x_\\gamma )    + \\sum_{\\alpha \\subset \\gamma } b_\\alpha \\log p_\\gamma(x_\\alpha )    - \\lambda_\\gamma(x_\\gamma )    + \\text{const . }    , \\ ] ] where the additive constant is irrelevant and we can absorb it into the lagrange multipliers . setting the above derivatives to zero resolves stationarization with respect to probability distributions .",
    "the natural iteration method consists in rewriting such equations in a fixed point form , that is @xmath30^{-b_\\alpha }    ,    \\label{eq : nim}\\ ] ] and then solving them by simple iteration . a new estimate of the basic cluster probability distribution @xmath31 is obtained from the previous one @xmath28 trough its marginals @xmath23 .",
    "the lagrange multipliers must be determined at each iteration , so that also @xmath31 satisfies the required constraints .",
    "this job can be done in different ways by a nested procedure ( inner loop ) , for instance a newton - raphson method or a suitable fixed point method  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we do not deal with the determination of lagrange multipliers , but we only focus on the convergence of the main loop .",
    "as usual for iterative algorithms designed to minimize functionals that are bounded from below , a proof of convergence can be given by the decreasing of the functional value at each iteration .",
    "this is actually the case for the natural iteration method .",
    "let us consider the free energy difference @xmath32-f[p]$ ] for two subsequent iterations @xmath33 , where @xmath22 $ ] is defined by eqs .   and  .",
    "taking the logarithm of both sides of eq .  , we can rewrite the nim equations in two different ways , that are @xmath34 @xmath35 let us replace the former into @xmath32 $ ] and the latter into @xmath22 $ ] . remembering that probability distributions satisfy the constraints , whence latter term on the right hand side of eq .",

    "if all subcluster coefficients @xmath40 were negative , we could apply the same argument to all terms , and the upperbound would be zero .",
    "such a situation occurs for instance in the bethe  @xcite and husimi tree  @xcite approximations , and the proof of convergence would be complete . in a general case",
    "we have to require a condition on the @xmath40  coefficients .",
    "the basic idea is to `` couple '' smaller cluster terms with a positive coefficient to larger cluster terms with a negative coefficient , yielding a sum of `` negative '' kullbach - liebler distances ( some between conditional probability distributions ) , which can then be upperbounded by zero .",
    "the details are given in the following .",

    "is proved by the fact that the logarithm inequality holds if and only if @xmath56 , i.e. , the kullbach - liebler distance between two probability distributions is zero if and only if the two distributions are equal .",
    "in this section we consider some particular choices of basic clusters , that is , some particular cvm approximations for regular lattices on which several model systems are defined .      by `` plaquette '' approximations we mean a class of approximations in which basic clusters are of a unique type ( which we denote as plaquette , for example a square on a square lattice ) , while subclusters with non zero coefficients are only single sites and nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "let us denote such clusters by @xmath8 and @xmath58 respectively , and , according to the notation introduced in sec .",
    "ii , let us denote by @xmath59 and @xmath60 the coefficients of the cluster entropy expansion , by @xmath61 and @xmath62 the numbers of plaquettes sharing a given subcluster , and by @xmath63 the normalized coefficients . in this class of approximations ,",
    "it is possible to show that all the coefficients can be obtained as a function of @xmath64 and of the lattice coordination number  @xmath65 . making use of eq .  , and",
    "remembering that basic clusters ( plaquettes ) have unit @xmath66-coefficient , we can write @xmath67 from which @xmath63 are easily obtained : @xmath68 then , we have to impose the sufficient conditions on the coefficients , eqs .   and  . from eq",
    "we easily see that  @xmath69 , which is ok for upperbounding , but usually  @xmath70 .",
    "we then have to couple each site to pairs that contain it and are contained in a given plaquette .",
    "let us adopt the strategy of splitting the site coefficient among such pairs in equal parts , so that , being @xmath71 the only allocation coefficient and @xmath72 the number of pairs , eqs .   and   read @xmath73 the allocation coefficient may be easily eliminated , yielding the single condition @xmath74 it is possible to show that also the @xmath72  parameter depends on @xmath75 only .",
    "let us imagine to multiply the number  @xmath65 of nearest neighbor pairs sharing a site times the number @xmath62 of plaquettes sharing a pair .",
    "it is easy to realize that in this way we have _ overcounted _",
    "@xmath72  times the number @xmath61 of plaquettes sharing the given site , i.e. , @xmath76 with the above manipulation , the condition   can be rewritten as @xmath77 in this form we can easily verify its validity , which is done in tab .",
    "[ tab : coefficients ] for a set of typical plaquette approximations .",
    "we have considered : the 2d square , triangular , and honeycomb lattices with a 4-site square  @xcite , a 3-site triangle  @xcite , and an elementary hexagon as basic cluster respectively , the simple cubic ( sc ) lattice with a 4-site square  @xcite as basic cluster , and the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice with a 3-site triangle  @xcite or a 4-site tetrahedron  @xcite as basic cluster .",
    "the b and c  hierarchies , originally proposed by kikuchi and brush  @xcite , are series of approximations with increasing cluster size , suitable for 2d square  @xcite and triangular  @xcite lattices .",
    "they are interesting mainly because they converge towards the exact free energy , in spite of the fact that the cluster size increases only in one direction .",
    "this result has been proved rigorously only for the c  hierarchy  @xcite , but there are numerical evidences for both  @xcite .",
    "such results  @xcite are related to the transfer matrix concept : as the bethe approximation solves exactly an ising - like chain , the cvm , with infinitely long 1d stripes as basic clusters ( to which the b and c  hierarchies tend ) , solves exactly a 2d lattice .",
    "here we are interested in showing that these approximations verify the sufficient condition for the convergence discussed above .",
    "let us consider for instance the b  hierarchy on the triangular lattice ( a completely analogous treatment holds for the c  hierarchy and/or for the square lattice ) .",
    "the basic clusters , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gerb ] ( top row , left column ) , are made up of a sequence of @xmath78  up- and @xmath79  down - pointing triangles , where @xmath79 is an adjustable parameter .",
    "of course , also corresponding clusters with @xmath79  up- and @xmath78  down - pointing triangles are allowed , but all basic clusters always extends only in one direction .",
    "this choice can be viewed as a generalization of the triangle plaquette approximation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gerb ] , top row , right column ) , where of course also up - pointing triangles are included in the set of basic clusters . in the following rows of fig .",
    "[ fig : gerb ] also the subclusters of the given basic cluster , having nonzero coefficients in the cluster entropy expansion ( @xmath66-coefficients ) , are displayed .",
    "they are divided in pair - like and site - like subclusters , in that they can be put in one - to - one correspondence with pair and site subclusters for the triangle plaquette approximations .",
    "such analogy is not only a pictorial one .",
    "in fact , it is possible to show ( for instance making use of eq .  , but see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the @xmath66-coefficients are @xmath80 for pair - like clusters and",
    "@xmath81 for site - like clusters , like for the triangle plaquette approximation .",
    "the same holds for @xmath82-coefficients , i.e. , the numbers of basic clusters sharing a given subclusters , which turn out to be @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively , whence @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "finally , from fig .",
    "[ fig : gerb ] one easily sees that also the same `` allocation '' technique as for the plaquette approximation can be used . inside a given basic cluster , each site - like subcluster",
    "is shared by @xmath87 pair - like clusters , and each pair - like cluster contains 2 site - like subclusters , whence inequality   is satisfied .      finally , let us consider the case of a hypercubic lattice in @xmath0  dimensions , and let us choose a @xmath0-dimensional hypercube ( @xmath0-cube ) as basic cluster .",
    "of course , the relevant cases are @xmath88 , the former of which coincides with the square plaquette approximation , mentioned above , but the interest of a general treatment will be clearer later .",
    "it is possible to show , by repeated use of eq .",
    ", that clusters with non zero coefficients are only @xmath89-cubes , for @xmath90 , and the @xmath89-cube coefficient in @xmath0 dimensions is @xmath91",
    ". moreover , the number of @xmath0-cubes sharing a given @xmath89-cube ( in @xmath0 dimensions ) is @xmath92 . as a consequence ,",
    "the normalized coefficients turn out to be @xmath93 let us now impose the sufficient conditions , eqs .   and  .",
    "let us notice that the positive coefficients , those who give problems for upperbounding , have the @xmath89  index with the same parity as  @xmath0 , that is @xmath94 .",
    "then we can couple each @xmath89-cube with @xmath95-cubes that contain it and are contained in a given @xmath0-cube . as for plaquette approximations , let us split the @xmath89-cube coefficient in equal parts , so that we have a single @xmath96 allocation coefficient .",
    "we still have to observe that each @xmath89-cube is shared by @xmath97 @xmath95-cubes contained in the same @xmath0-cube ( the equivalent of the @xmath72  parameter for plaquette approximations ) , and that each @xmath95-cube contains @xmath98 different @xmath89-cubes ( the equivalent of @xmath58  sites in a pair ) .",
    "we can then rewrite eqs .   and   as @xmath99 by eliminating the allocation coefficient",
    ", we obtain @xmath100 which , replacing eq .   and",
    "taking into account that @xmath97 is always even ( as previously mentioned ) , becomes @xmath101 such inequality becomes more and more difficult to be satisfied as the subcluster index  @xmath89 increases .",
    "therefore we have to consider the worst case , that is @xmath102 , leading to @xmath103 this results essentially proves the convergence for @xmath104 , because the @xmath105 case coincides with the square plaquette approximation . nevertheless , it is mainly interesting in that it gives us the opportunity to experiment the natural iteration method in a case in which the sufficient condition is not verified .",
    "we have actually implemented the procedure for the simple ising model on the @xmath106 hypercubic lattice , easily finding cases in which the behavior is non convergent ( oscillating ) .",
    "this fact lead us to conjecture that actually the sufficient condition might be also a necessary one .",
    "in a recent paper  @xcite , a general method for the minimization of non convex functionals , related to the existence of suitable upperbounds to the functional to be minimized , is proposed and applied to the case of the cvm free energy .",
    "different possible choices for the upperbounding functional are investigated .",
    "hereafter , we show that one choice proposed there , which by the way turns out to be quite convenient in terms of computation time , is equivalent to the natural iteration method .",
    "first , let us briefly recall the general method , which is based on the following .",
    "* theorem : *  let @xmath22 $ ] be a continuous functional in the set of variables @xmath107 , defined in some compact domain  @xmath108 , and @xmath109 $ ] an auxiliary continuous functional in a pair of variable sets @xmath110 , defined in the domain  @xmath111 , having a unique minimum with respect to  @xmath112 for each fixed  @xmath107 . let the auxiliary functional satisfy the following requirements : @xmath113 \\leq \\bar{f}[p , p ' ]    \\label{eq : flefbar } \\\\ & &    f[p ' ] = \\bar{f}[p , p ' ] \\ \\ \\longleftrightarrow \\ \\ p ' = p    ,    \\label{eq : feqfbariff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is , the auxiliary functional is an upperbound to the original functional , and equality holds if and only if the two arguments of the former are equal .",

    "* proof : *  it is easy to obtain the following inequality chain @xmath36 \\leq \\bar{f}[p,\\hat{p } ] \\leq \\bar{f}[p , p ] = f[p ]    ,    \\label{eq : ineqchain}\\ ] ] proving immediately eq .  .",
    "the first inequality is the first hypothesis on the auxiliary functional  @xmath116 , eq .  ; the second inequality is a consequence of the definition of  @xmath117 , eq .  ; the equality descends from the second hypothesis on  @xmath116 , eq .  .",
    "in order to prove also eq .  , we have to show that both inequalities hold as equalities if and only if  @xmath118 .",

    "we have investigated on the convergence of the natural iteration method , proposed by kikuchi as a minimization procedure for cluster variational free energies and widely employed in a lot of applications of the cvm .",
    "we have discussed a condition on the coefficients of the cluster entropy expansion , which is sufficient to prove that the free energy decreases at each iteration , ensuring the convergence of the method .",
    "such a condition is based on the idea of pairing subcluster entropies with a positive coefficient to larger subcluster terms with a negative coefficient , yielding a set of conditional entropy terms with negative coefficients .",
    "it had already been proved by kikuchi in the original paper  @xcite that negative coefficient terms give decreasing contributions to the free energy .",
