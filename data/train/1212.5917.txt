    "molecular clouds , recent photometric results from _ herschel _ suggest that large - scale turbulence might be responsible for the formation of filaments @xcite , while spectroscopic studies , sensitive to smaller scales , show that filaments present subsonic non - thermal motions @xcite , indicative of a dissipation of turbulence at smaller scales .",
    "while this is consistent with observations in more distant and massive star - forming regions , such as g28.34 + 0.06 @xcite , a number of studies reveal supersonic non - thermal motions and suggest the formation of filaments by the convergence of flows or by filament - filament collisions on large scales @xcite .",
    "in addition , theoretical studies propose that magnetic fields could play a role in the formation of filaments ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "in the previous section we presented the main properties of the two hub - filament systems in g14.2250.506 . hubs are more compact ( aspect ratio 5 vs 15 ) , warmer ( @xmath1@xmath5215  k vs 11  k ) , and show larger velocity dispersion and larger masses per unit length than filaments .",
    "interestingly , hubs are associated with h@xmath12o  maser emission ( wang et al .",
    "2006 ) and mid - infrared sources ( see figs .  [ fg14spitzer ] , [ fg14nh3moms ] ) , and they are the main sites of stellar activity within the cloud .    the stability of the filaments can be studied by estimating the virial parameter @xmath54=@xmath55 @xcite , which is @xmath562 for all the filaments and hubs except for f10-e , and five out of eight filaments are near virial equilibrium ( @xmath54@xmath521 ) .",
    "this indicates that most of the filaments are unstable ( collapsing ) and probably undergoing fragmentation , compatible with the clumpy structure of g14.2 .",
    "it is worth noting that filament f10-e has @xmath1  and velocity dispersion values similar to the hub properties .",
    "filament f10-e presents some striations converging toward it .",
    "however , while hub - n and hub - s seem to be places where two different velocity structures converge , f10-e shows only one velocity component .",
    "we speculate that i18153 , an uc  hii  region with @xmath57@xmath210@xmath58  @xmath10  ( snchez - monge , private communication ) , may compress the gas , heating and injecting turbulence to this filament ( @xmath595 ) .",
    "the interaction of this uc  hii  region with the dense gas is also seen in hub - n , where the nh@xmath0(2,2)/nh@xmath0(1,1 ) map shows a local heating ( fig .",
    "[ fg14pvplots ] ) .",
    "the position - velocity ( pv ) plot along this hub ( see fig .  [ fg14pvplots ] ) reveals an inverted c - like structure , consistent with an expanding shell @xcite .",
    "we investigated the fragmentation of filaments in the magnetohydrodynamic ` sausage'-type instability scenario ( chandrasekhar & fermi 1953 , see also jackson et al .",
    "2010 ) , which predicts periodic separation between fragments ( or cores ) for a given density and isothermal sound speed .",

    "this is the case of g14.2 , since @xmath60 and @xmath61 are 0.12  pc and 0.04  pc , respectively . adopting a density of @xmath46  @xmath47",
    ", we estimated the predicted core separation using first the isothermal sound speed , yielding @xmath40@xmath20.160.21  pc , and then replacing @xmath43 by the total velocity dispersion @xmath48 , which gives @xmath40@xmath20.40.8  pc ( see table  [ g14filaments ] ) .",
    "the observed separation , @xmath20.33  pc , is in agreement with these two extreme cases .",
    "it is noteworthy that most of the cores appear to be elongated along the direction of the filament , which could imply the possibility of further fragmentation at smaller scales as observed in the irdcg28.34 + 0.06-p1 @xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing features of g14.2 is the network of filaments that are aligned in parallel .",
    "the filaments appear to take two preferred directions , one group at a pa of 10@xmath6 , and the others at a pa of 60@xmath6 .",
    "this network of filaments may arise from a layer of self - gravitating gas .",
    "instability analysis has been performed for a layer of an isothermal infinite sheet under dynamical perturbation @xcite .",
    "the gas is unstable to perturbations , which leads to high density columns in the plane as a result of gravitational instability .",
    "the spacings between the high density columns of gas correspond to the wavelength of the fastest growth mode . in the absence of magnetic fields",
    ", the growth of instability does not have a preferred direction in the plane . as a result",
    ", a grid of connected filaments appears in the gas layer .",
    "if the gas layer is threaded by magnetic fields , the growth of the instability develops unrestricted in one direction and is suppressed along the orthogonal direction .",
    "@xcite analyzed a pressure confined isothermal gas layer threaded by uniform magnetic fields .",
    "they found that in the regime of smaller external pressure ( i.e.,the scale height @xmath61@xmath63@xmath64 , where @xmath64 is the thickness of the gas layer ) the instability grows faster along the field lines . as a consequence , high density columns , or filaments develop with their longitudinal axis perpendicular to the field lines . in the high pressure regime ( i.e. ,  @xmath61@xmath65@xmath64 )",
    ", the fastest growth of instability is perpendicular to the field lines and gives rise to filaments parallel to the magnetic fields .",
    "recent numerical simulations ( van loo , private communication ) confirm the linear analysis in @xcite .",
    "the simulations show that an array of high density columns develop in the gas layer with magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , lower density filamentary structures are also present , inter - connecting the main filaments .",
    "the highest density structures are found at the intersections of major and minor filaments , as in this work .",
    "furthermore , the simulations show that gravitational instability develops within a filament during the filament formation .",
    "this means that fragmentation of a filament into cores occurs simultaneously with the fragmentation of the sheet , but according to @xcite with different free - fall times .",
    "the array of filamentary structures in g14.2250.506 may arise from gravitational instability of a thin gas layer with magnetic fields .",
    "in fact , preliminary near - infrared polarimetric observations around hub - n ( busquet et al .  in prep .",
    ") reveal that the magnetic field is perpendicular to filaments at pa@xmath260@xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fg14nh3moms ] ) . therefore , according to @xcite g14.2 would be in the regime of small external pressure ( @xmath66 ) . using the total surface density",
    "( see sect .",
    "3 ) , the scale height @xmath61 of the initial gas layer is @xmath670.09  pc .",
    "this value should be regarded with caution , and to definitively assess its validity one would need observations of a low - density gas tracer to be sensitive to the gas layer . the wavelength of the fastest mode can be expressed as @xmath68 ( eq .  60 in @xcite ) . using our estimation of @xmath61 ,",
    "the predicted separation is @xmath21.1  pc , in agreement with the observed filament separation ( between 0.5 and 1  pc ) .",
    "it is not clear how such a large gas layer ( 4.7@xmath298.7  pc ) may form initially .",
    "the convergence of dynamic flows could be responsible for the formation of such a large gas layer that subsequently could fragment into parallel filaments as a result of magnetic modulation .",
    "our nh@xmath0  data , although showing two velocity components , do not reveal evidence of converging / interacting flows and further observations of low - velocity shock tracers , like sio or ch@xmath0cn @xcite , and a tracer of low density material are required to definitely identify signatures of converging flows .",
