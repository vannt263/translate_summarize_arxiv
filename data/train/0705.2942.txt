    "the one - dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite is a stochastic process of many particles which perform asymmetric random walks with hardcore exclusion interaction . the asep is a simple model of statistical mechanical systems driven away from equilibrium @xcite . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", it shows a rich variety of phenomena and has attracted much attention .",
    "the stationary properties at a single time are already of great physical interest .",
    "a lot of insights have been obtained about the boundary induced phase transitions , the long range correlations and so on using the powerful matrix product method @xcite .    as for time dependent properties of the asep ,",
    "the average behaviors are rather well described by the mean - field approximation .",
    "we can also understand some part of fluctuations from the fact that the asep belongs to the kardar - parisi - zhang(kpz ) universality class of surface growth models @xcite .",
    "in particular the critical exponents are understood by the dynamical renormalization method and can be confirmed by some exact solutions @xcite .    in the past decade",
    "we have seen a substantial progress of understanding of this scaling behaviors of the 1d kpz systems . in the language of the asep ,",
    "a different approach based on a connection to the random matrix theory has been developed for the infinite system .",
    "it has allowed us to compute several time dependent quantities quite explicitly .",
    "several important results and insights which have been obtained so far are ( 1)the fluctuations of the integrated current for several initial conditions have been computed and are shown to be equivalent to those of the largest eigenvalue of gaussian ensembles .",
    "( 2 ) the stationary two point correlation function has been computed explicitly .",
    "( 3 ) the effects of boundary and initial conditions have been made quite explicit for certain special cases .",
    "a problem is that these results are rather involved and often described in the language of random matrix theory .",
    "moreover some results are stated from the point of view of other related models and the connection to the asep is not obvious .",
    "hence for those who are not very familiar with random matrix theory and these models , the developments might look not easily accessible . the purpose of this article is to explain the basics of random matrix techniques and the relationship to a few of the related models .",
    "some part of this paper will overlap with the paper by prhofer and spohn @xcite which contains a lot of information on the same topic .",
    "the present article aims at giving some background knowledge for @xcite and at the same time a collection of new results obtained after @xcite .",
    "see also recent review papers on related topics @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we define the model .",
    "we mainly study the discrete time tasep with parallel update scheme . the continuous time version is also considered . in section 3 ,",
    "we map the problem of current to a combinatorial one and get an expression in the form of multiple integrals . in section 4 , the basics of the random matrix techniques are explained .",
    "the multi - point fluctuations are studied in section 5 by introducing the discrete polynuclear growth model and its multi - layer version . some generalizations and variants",
    "are explained in section 6 . in section 7 , we explain another approach based on the green s function .",
    "the final section is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "in this article we mainly consider a discrete time tasep ( dtasep ) on the infinite lattice , @xmath0 .",
    "there are several versions of the update schemes . here",
    "we employ the parallel update for which the model is defined as follows .",
    "each site of the lattice can be occupied by a particle or is empty ( fig .",
    "suppose that at each time step each particle tosses its own coin which shows heads with probability @xmath1 .",
    "if it turns out a head the particle tries to hop to the right neighboring site . if the target site is occupied , the hopping does not occur due to the exclusion interaction among particles .",
    "if it turns out a tail , on the other hand , the particle remains at the same site .",
    "this is the tasep with parallel update .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 here should not be confused with the asymmetry parameter in the partially asep which is often referred to as @xmath2 in the study of asep .",
    "the above definition describes how the configuration of the lattice changes as time goes on .",
    "it is also possible to define the same process by focusing on when each particle makes jumps to the right .",
    "notice that the distribution of the waiting time of each hopping after it becomes possible is geometrically distributed with parameter @xmath2 .",
    "suppose that each particle has its own clock instead of the coin .",
    "it rings after geometrically distributed time at which the particle tries to hop to the right neighboring site .",
    "if the target site is occupied , the hopping does not occur .",
    "this description of the process defines the same tasep with parallel update as above .",
    "the stationary measure with constant density @xmath3 is rather simple .",
    "it is determined by the condition that the probability @xmath4 that arbitrary consecutive two sites @xmath5 are occupied ( @xmath6 ) or empty ( @xmath7 ) is given by @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the average current , @xmath10 we remark that in the stationary state the waiting time of each particle before making a hop is geometrically distributed with parameter @xmath11 .    in the study of nonequilibrium systems ,",
    "one of the most fundamental quantity is the current .",
    "let @xmath12 be the number of particles which crossed the bond between sites 0 and 1 from time 0 through @xmath13 . the average behavior is easily seen to be @xmath14 , or more precisely , @xmath15 hence the next step is to understand the fluctuation of this quantity . from the kpz theory the exponent of the fluctuation",
    "is expected to scale as @xmath16 .",
    "the random matrix techniques allow us to compute even the scaling function .",
    "note that the stationary measure is not enough to get such information .",
    "there is an important limiting case ; @xmath17 .",
    "since the hopping probability @xmath1 goes to zero , one has to rescale the time at the same time to take a meaningful limit .",
    "let us consider the limit @xmath18 with @xmath19 fixed . in this limit",
    "the process reduces to the continuous time tasep ( ctasep ) which is the most well studied in the study of asep @xcite . in ctasep during infinitesimal time duration @xmath20 , each particle tries to hop to the right neighboring site with probability @xmath20 under the same exclusion principle as for the discrete case .",
    "it is again possible to define the model using the waiting time for hoppings .",
    "the only difference as compared to the dtasep is that each clock now rings after an exponential time with parameter one .",
    "a remark is in order . in the following , when the ctasep is discussed , the time @xmath13 should be understood as the rescaled time @xmath21 .",
    "the stationary measure of the ctasep with density @xmath3 is bernoulli with parameter @xmath3 , i.e. , each site is independent and is occupied with probability @xmath3 or is empty with probability @xmath22 .",
    "the average current is known to be @xmath23 .",
    "in this section we explain a result for the fluctuation of @xmath12 following @xcite .",
    "the initial condition is taken to be the step one , in which all sites @xmath24 are occupied and all sites @xmath25 are empty at time 0 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . in this case one can label the particles from the right so that the particle @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) starts from site @xmath28 .",
    "several results for other initial and boundary conditions will be explained in sections 6 and 7 .",
    "we denote the measure corresponding to the asep dynamics by @xmath29 .",
    "the first step in this approach is to introduce the `` waiting time '' table , or the matrix @xmath30 , in which the @xmath31 element @xmath32 is the waiting time of the @xmath26th particle before making the @xmath33th hop after the target site becomes empty .",
    "let us see the example in fig .",
    "3 . the configuration does not change until the first particle moves to the site one .",
    "it took 1 step before the first move and hence @xmath34 .",
    "now two particles can move to the right .",
    "it took 1 step ( resp . 2 steps ) before the second ( resp .",
    "first ) particle makes the first ( resp .",
    "second ) jump and hence @xmath35 ( resp .",
    "@xmath36 ) . after the second jump of the first particle",
    "the second particle waits 2 steps before the next move and hence @xmath37 .",
    "one continues this process to get all @xmath32 s for a given sample of the dynamics of dtasep . for this example",
    "the matrix looks like @xmath38 it is clear that the time evolution of the dtasep is equivalent to the infinite matrix @xmath32 .",
    "if we call a matrix whose elements are nonnegative integers an @xmath39 matrix , @xmath40 is an @xmath39 matrix .",
    "when considering various realizations of dynamics , each @xmath32 is a random variable and geometrically distributed with parameter @xmath2 ; @xmath41 .",
    "next let us define @xmath42 by @xmath43 here @xmath44 is a path from @xmath45 to @xmath46 which consists of elementary path connecting points @xmath47 or @xmath48 . in the matrix representation as in ( [ wex ] )",
    ", @xmath44 is a down / right path , i.e. , it starts from @xmath45 and goes either down or right until it reaches @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath49 is the collection of all such paths . if we regard @xmath32 as representing a value of a potential energy at a position @xmath31 , ( [ gdef ] )",
    "can be considered as the problem of the zero temperature directed polymer in random medium .",
    "one can confirm oneself that @xmath50 is equal to the time at which the @xmath51th particle has just made the @xmath52th step .",
    "considering the dynamics of the @xmath51th particle , one notices that @xmath53 is equivalent to saying that the @xmath51th particle makes the @xmath51th jump before @xmath13 .",
    "hence we have @xmath54 = \\mathbb{p}[g(n , n)+2n-1 \\leq t].\\ ] ] though @xmath40 is in principle an infinite matrix , to study @xmath12 , we can restrict our attention to the @xmath55 submatrix @xmath56 of @xmath40 .",
    "this is related to the markov property and the fact that in the tasep each particle can not affect the dynamics of the particles on its right .",
    "for instance , from the @xmath57 submatrix of @xmath40 , @xmath58 one sees that @xmath59 with the maximizing path , @xmath60 .",
    "this gives @xmath61 which agrees with the time at which the third particle has made the third hop in fig .",
    "3 .    to proceed we use a bijection known as the robinson - schensted - knuth(rsk ) algorithm between an @xmath39 matrix and a pair @xmath62 of semistandard young tableaux(ssyt ) .",
    "a short explanation about the ssyt and the schur function is given in the appendix .",
    "for more details and the rsk algorithm , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the pair of ssyts corresponding to ( [ w3 ] ) is @xmath63 in the language of ssyt , the @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the length of the first row of @xmath67 .",
    "this is easily seen as a property of the rsk algorithm . for our example",
    ", @xmath68 is the same as @xmath69 .",
    "therefore the problem of @xmath12 is reduced to a combinatorial problem of ssyts .",

    "in this section , we explain the basics of the techniques from random matrix theory which would be helpful to understand the results for the asep . in physics",
    "the random matrices were first introduced to model a complex hamiltonian of nuclei .",

    "the basic reference of random matrix theory is @xcite .",
    "the book by forrester @xcite is also very useful .",
    "a random matrix is a matrix with random elements .",
    "there are infinitely many variety of random matrix ensembles but there are some random matrix ensembles with especially good properties . among them",
    "are the gaussian ensembles which are defined by the probability distribution of @xmath55 matrices , @xmath87 here @xmath88 takes three different values @xmath89 .",
    "when @xmath90 , @xmath91 is taken to be a real symmetric matrix and @xmath92 .",
    "writing down the @xmath93 in ( [ rm ] ) explicitly , one sees that this definition is equivalent to saying that each independent element obeys a gaussian distribution with variance 1 for the diagonal and 1/2 for the off - diagonal elements .",
    "this ensemble is called the gaussian orthogonal ensemble(goe ) . for @xmath94 , @xmath91",

    "is called the gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) . for this case , @xmath91 is taken to be a self - dual quaternion matrix , whose definition is not given here .",
    "in many applications we are interested in the statistics of eigenvalues . for the gaussian ensembles , we can derive the joint density function for eigenvalues explicitly .",
    "basically we change the coordinate from the original matrix elements to the eigenvalues and the diagonalizing matrix and then integrate out the latter degrees of freedom .",
