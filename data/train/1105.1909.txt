    "stars form due to the local collapse of material in molecular clouds .",
    "the conditions prior to the collapse result from a complex interplay between self - gravity , turbulence , magnetic fields and thermodynamics . understanding the effects of each of these influences leads to a better knowledge of how stars form . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the role played by interstellar turbulence and it s effect on the structure of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "the subject of astrophysical turbulence is complex and not fully understood , though there are many useful reviews on the topic ( e.g. elmegreen & scalo , scalo & elmegreen , brandenburg & nordlund @xcite ) .",
    "here we are interested in comparing the structure of nearby gmcs to investigate whether it has an influence on the observed star formation properties . ultimately this might also be used to determine the nature of the turbulent field , i.e. driven by a compressive forcing or solenoidal driving ( e.g. federrath et al . ) .",
    "we will probe the column density structure in nearby gmcs by means of extinction maps derived from near - infrared observations .",
    "this is the least biased way to estimate column density ( goodman et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in the first paper in this series ( rowles & froebrich @xcite , hereafter paperi )",
    ", we presented new all - sky extinction maps derived using data from the 2micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , skrutskie et al .",
    "we used the _",
    "median _ near - infrared colour excess technique ( nice ) to calculate the extinction ( see lada et al .",
    "the nearest 25 , 49 and 100 stars to the centre of each pixel were used , hence the noise can be considered constant throughout the map .",
    "these extinction maps are therefore referred to as _ con - noise _ maps .    in our second paper ( froebrich & rowles @xcite , hereafter paperii ) , we analysed the column density and mass distributions of a selection of 16 nearby gmcs . to facilitate this we determined new extinction maps using only the stars within each pixel ( i.e. no oversampling ) , which therefore have a constant spatial resolution and",
    "are referred to as _ con - res _ maps . as a result of the analysis we found a universal star formation threshold of about 6.0@xmath21.5mag @xmath3 .",
    "this threshold separates two different regions in the clouds . below the threshold , at low column densities , turbulence dominates the structure , while at higher column densities gravity is the dominant force . the low @xmath3 part of the clouds could be fitted by a log - normal distribution .",
    "there were significant differences in the slopes of the column density and mass distributions when considering only the low @xmath3 regions .",
    "this shows that the properties of the turbulence differ depending on the environment of the cloud .",
    "regarding the high @xmath3 regions , we found no such differences , implying that gravity solely dominates these parts .    using our extinction maps we can derive column density structure functions similar to velocity structure functions ( e.g. padoan et al .",
    "@xcite ) for each molecular cloud . this will allow us to perform a comparison with models of interstellar turbulence .",
    "predictions of structure functions resulting from a turbulent medium have been presented e.g. by schmidt et al .",
    "@xcite , kolmogorov @xcite , she & leveque @xcite and boldyrev @xcite ( hereafter s08 , k41 , sl94 and b02 , respectively ) .    in this paper",
    "we test for correlations between structure function parameters and the properties of the clouds .",
    "we also examine the cloud structures using the @xmath1-variance technique ( see stutzki et al . and ossenkopf et al . ) and in particular the mass spectral index scaling coefficient . in sec.[sfmeth ] we describe the methods used for our analysis . in sec.[results ] we give the results for the clouds selected .",
    "we discuss these results and give conclusions in secs.[discuss ] and [ conclusions ] , respectively .",
    "the general definition of the structure function is given in eq.[struct1 ] , ( e.g. lombardi et al . ;",
    "padoan et al . @xcite and padoan et al .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "the equation is expressed in terms of our observable  the column density or optical extinction @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4    @xmath5 is the distance between points , @xmath6 represents a position in the map , @xmath3 is the optical extinction at @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 is the order of the structure function . for @xmath9",
    "the equation is the two - point correlation function of the extinction map .",
    "the brackets @xmath10 denote that the average over all pixel positions @xmath6 and all possible directions for the separation @xmath5 of points is applied . for each order",
    "@xmath8 we find the scaling exponent @xmath11 by fitting a power - law to values of @xmath12 against @xmath5 .",
    "this assumes that the scaling exponents are related to the structure functions by eq.[struct2 ] ( e.g. padoan et al .",
    "@xcite ) :    @xmath13    equation[struct2 ] allows us to determine the scaling exponents @xmath11 which are then normalised to the third order @xmath14 , as a universal behaviour should be exhibited at low reynolds numbers ( determined by benzi et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    for each gmc investigated we used the range of spatial scales @xmath5 from 0.1pc to 1.0pc to fit the power law exponent , in order to be able to compare the results for all clouds .",
    "we then follow padoan et al .",
    "@xcite and assume the column density scaling exponents @xmath15 are equivalent to the velocity scaling exponents @xmath16 ( dubrulle @xcite ) .",
    "they can then be expressed by a relation of the form as shown in eq.[dubeq ] .",
    "@xmath17    here @xmath18 is the intermittency and @xmath1 is related to the co - dimension @xmath19 and intermittency by : @xmath20 .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath21 of the cloud is related to the co - dimension by @xmath22 . using this equation ,",
    "the k41 relation can be expressed by setting @xmath23=0 .",
    "as mentioned previously we use the projected column density scaling parameter @xmath24 instead of the velocity scaling parameter @xmath25 to keep the same description of the structure function as in padoan et al .",
    "@xcite , though it is not known _ a priori _ whether the parameters correspond to each other .",
    "however , padoan et al .",
    "@xcite found that the scaling exponents derived from integrated intensity images follow the velocity scaling using the b02 relation .",
    "we may then derive the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath19 , @xmath18 and @xmath21 for each cloud and compare with the velocity field structure functions obtained from the aforementioned theoretical works by k41 , sl94 , b02 and s08 .",
    "when fitting our data to eq.[dubeq ] , we varied @xmath1 in the range 0.02 to 1.20 with increments of 0.01 , and @xmath19 ranged from 0.02 to 3.00 with increments of 0.01 to find the best match . only fits with an @xmath26 better than 0.1 ( in units of @xmath15 ) were considered a good fit .",
    "this is justified given that @xmath26 is not an absolute measure of the goodness of fit .",
    "regarding the previously published models , the simplest to consider is that of k41 .",
    "the energy over a wide range of lengths ( known as the ` inertial range ' ) in turbulent flows is redistributed from larger scales into ever smaller scales until the effects of viscosity become important . in k41 , kolmogorov considered the structure velocity functions s@xmath27 and s@xmath28 , showing that both are power laws of the form of eq.[struct2 ] , with the exponents being 2/3 and 1 , respectively . due to the self - similarity of turbulence at different scales ,",
    "this law can be extended to all powers of @xmath8 such that @xmath29 .",
    "however , experimental measurements for the scaling exponents show a deviation from the k41 relation for turbulence , for higher orders of @xmath8 - known as _ intermittency_. this is exhibited in the non - gaussian tails when plotting the probability density functions ( pdfs ) of e.g. the column density , and anomalous scaling of higher order structure functions ( e.g. anselmet et al .",
    "therefore , we need a relation for the scaling that considers the effects of intermittency .",
    "sl94 derived a scaling relation that accounts for intermittency .",
    "their relation shows good agreement when compared to simulations of structures that are not influenced by magnetic fields . for incompressible turbulence",
    "sl94 derived that @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the sl94 model assumes that @xmath32 , i.e. that the most intermittent structures are filaments .",
    "b02 extended the sl94 relation to model highly supersonic turbulence and also take account of magnetic fields .",
    "they found that @xmath33 with @xmath31 as with the sl94 model . under the b02 model",
    "it follows that @xmath34 , i.e. that the structures are sheet - like in form .    in s08 , the scaling exponents were found to be well described by log - poisson models . in these models",
    "@xmath35 , rather than @xmath36 .",
    "the modelling applied two types of forcing to drive the turbulence , solenoidal ( divergence - free ) and compressive ( rotation - free ) .",
    "values for the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath19 differ depending on the type of forcing applied .",
    "perhaps the nature of forcing in real clouds can be found by comparing the observational data with the s08 model .      to ascertain the effect of noise in the data when calculating structure functions from an image we undertook a number of tests . in particular",
    "we desired to know whether ( increased ) random noise leads to a significant and/or systematic deviation of @xmath15 compared to a test image without noise , or a low noise @xmath3 map .",
    "in the first instance we made an artificial @xmath3 map of 400@xmath37400 pixels containing a circle of radius 124 pixels , where the pixel values in the circle are varied linearly from 0.81mag ( edge ) to 10.0mag ( centre ) . this may be considered analogous to a perfectly spherical cloud with a smooth density variation from the core to the edge ( admittedly , an unlikely scenario in practice ) .",
    "all other pixels in the map were set to zero .",
    "the structure function of this map happened to correspond to kolmogorov type turbulence .",
    "we then added 0.28mag gaussian noise ( corresponding to the 1@xmath38 noise in our 49@xmath39 nearest neighbour map  see paperi ) to this map and fit the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath19 , @xmath18 and @xmath21 .",
    "this process was continued by adding further amounts of noise to the basic map with 0.28mag ( 1@xmath38 ) noise .",
    "the quantities added were a further 0.0625@xmath38 , 0.125@xmath38 , 0.1875@xmath38 and 0.25@xmath38 , generating five images in total .",
    "the results of this exercise are discussed in sec.[noires ] .",
    "in addition to investigating the effect of noise on artificial clouds , we added random noise to a selection of real clouds .",
    "the clouds chosen were chameleon , circinus , corona australis , oriona and orionb .",
    "we used the nearest 49@xmath39 nearest neighbour @xmath3 maps and added 0.0625@xmath38 , 0.125@xmath38 , 0.1875@xmath38 and 0.25@xmath38 noise .",
    "we performed the structure function analysis as with the artificial clouds .",
    "these results are also discussed in sec.[noires ] .      the @xmath1-variance method for analysing molecular cloud structures in astronomical images ( i.e. in two dimensions )",
    "was introduced by stutzki et al . and improved by ossenkopf et al . .",
    "the method works by measuring the quantity of structure on a particular length scale ( e.g. @xmath5 ) and filtering the data @xmath40 with a spherically symmetric ` down - up - down ' type function .",
    "the function ( denoted @xmath41 ) , which treats different regimes of @xmath5 separately , is given by eq.[frehat1 ] below .",
    "@xmath42    the rhs of eq.[frehat1 ] is defined using eqs.[mexhat1 ] and [ mexhat2 ] .",
    "@xmath43    @xmath44\\ ] ]    the @xmath1-variance , @xmath45 is then defined in eq.[delva1 ] .",
    "@xmath46    the filter function @xmath41 denotes the fourier transform of the filter function with size @xmath47 and diameter ratio @xmath48 .",
    "two particular filter types were found to best probe the structure in molecular clouds , a ` mexican hat ' filter and a ` french hat ' filter ( ossenkopf et al . ) .",
    "both filters treat the core and the annulus separately ( eq.[frehat1 ] ) .",
    "the optimal filter function for molecular clouds was found to be either a mexican hat filter with a diameter ratio of 1.5 , ( or a french hat filter with a diameter ratio of 2.3 - ossenkopf et al . ) .",
    "we used a mexican hat filter with a diameter ratio of 1.5 for our analysis .",
    "we applied this method to our _ con - noise maps_. to further investigate the dimensions of structures in the clouds ( i.e. filaments etc . )",
    "we also applied this method to the corresponding star density maps .",
    "the structure shown in the star density maps is enhanced since the extinction in the @xmath3 maps is roughly proportional to the @xmath49 of the star density .",
    "therefore , both the @xmath3 and star density maps were used for this analysis .",
    "the results are shown in sec.[delvrs ] .",
    "using the @xmath1-variance technique allows us to also calculate the mass spectral index scaling exponent ( denoted @xmath50 ) of each cloud .",
    "this is found by fitting a power - law to @xmath51 against scale .",
    "the power law is fitted over the range of size of the cloud , i.e. between the smallest and largest scales of the cloud .",
    "the smallest scale is determined by eliminating the pixels affected by oversampling . for the largest scale we chose the point where the increase in @xmath51 begins to tail off before the peak .",
    "these results are also shown in sec.[delvrs ] .      as with the structure functions it is also necessary to consider the effects of noise on the @xmath1-variance results .",
    "this was investigated in a similar way as for the structure functions ( see sec.[noistr ] ) .",
    "the same set of test images of 400@xmath37400 pixels containing a circle , as well as real clouds were used .",
    "the @xmath1-variance of these image was calculated .",
    "increments of gaussian noise were added to each of the images in exactly the same way as for the structure function analysis .",
    "the results are presented in sect.[noiresdvar ] .",
    "we estimate the average physical density of the cloud material in order to relate it to the cloud properties obtained from our analysis of the column density and the star formation properties . the average density of material can be estimated from the mass of the cloud @xmath52 above a certain @xmath3 threshold ,",
    "the number of pixels @xmath53 the cloud is covering in our @xmath3 map with values above this threshold , and the distance @xmath54 to the cloud in the following way :    @xmath55 = \\frac{8.78 \\cdot 10^{15 } \\cdot m [ m_{\\odot } ] } { n^{\\frac{3}{2 } } \\cdot ( x [ '' ] d [ pc ] ) ^3},\\ ] ]    here the average density is expressed in solar masses per cubic parsec , the mass in solar masses , the pixel size @xmath56 in arcsec and the distance @xmath54 in parsec .",
    "the power of @xmath57 at the number of pixels of the cloud assumes that the two visible dimensions in the plane of the sky are a good representation of the dimension along the line of sight .",
    "note that if one wants to express the density in units of particles per cubic centimeter , then the constant 8.78@xmath5810@xmath59 needs to be multiplied by a factor of 40 .",
    "we determine two average densities for the purpose of this paper .",
    "i ) the average density of the entire cloud .",
    "this includes all material which is above the self shielding column density threshold of 1mag @xmath3 .",
    "ii ) the average density of the material above the cloud s star formation threshold .",
    "this corresponds to the density of the material which is potentially involved in star formation .",
    "the results are shown in sect.[denres ] .",
    "for the analysis of the structure functions we used the three available _ con - noise _ maps ( see paperi ) for the following reasons :    \\i ) the noise has a less predictable effect on the results when using the _ con - res _ maps .",
    "this is caused by the fact that each pixel has a different number of stars contributing to the @xmath3 value , and hence variable noise . in some cases",
    "only very few stars are used .",
    "one drawback of using the _ con - noise _ maps for this analysis is the variable spatial resolution between pixels .",
    "this is most notable in regions of high extinction .",
    "however , we only include pixel separations above 0.1pc ( see above ) , which are generally above the spatial resolution .",
    "furthermore , we determine the structure functions only for the parts of the cloud where turbulence dominates , i.e. where @xmath3 is greater than 1mag and less than the cloud s individual star formation threshold ( generally below 8mag , see paperii ) .",
    "\\ii ) the obtained values for @xmath60 and @xmath14 are very low when using the _ con - res _ maps .",
    "this could be a result of the generally higher and , more importantly , variable noise in these maps . with the _ con - noise _ maps we found much more reasonable values for @xmath60 and @xmath14 .",
    "we calculate a mean value for @xmath60 of 0.8@xmath20.4 and @xmath14 of 1.1@xmath20.6 . for individual clouds , using taurus as an example , we find @xmath60=0.98 and @xmath14=1.41 , compared to @xmath60=0.77 and @xmath14=1.10 ( padoan et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for perseus",
    "we find @xmath60=1.24 and @xmath14=1.75 , compared to @xmath60=0.83 and @xmath14=1.18 .",
    "thus , we determine the structure function of every gmc for each of the three available @xmath3 maps , utilising only extinction values above the self - shielding limit ( 1mag ) and below the star formation threshold of the particular cloud .",
    "note that every individual extinction value used for these calculations has a signal - to - noise ratio of at least three ( paperi ) .",
    "hence , the obtained structure functions are highly reliable , as indicated by the small uncertainties for @xmath15 ( e.g. fig.[sfeg1 ] ) .    for each of the three structure functions we determine the best fitting set of parameters @xmath1 , @xmath19 , @xmath18 and @xmath21 , and a scatter for each parameter by considering only the fits with an @xmath26 of less than 0.1 ( in units of @xmath15 ) .",
    "the final structure function parameters for each cloud are then determined as weighted averages of the three obtained values . an example plot showing @xmath15 against @xmath8 for the auriga1 cloud together with the best fit",
    "is shown in fig.[sfeg1 ] , where we used the 49@xmath39 nearest neighbour map .",
    "similar plots for all clouds are shown in the appendix[indplt ] .     a plot showing the variation of @xmath15 against @xmath8 for the auriga1 cloud and the 49@xmath39 nearest neighbour map . our data ( + signs )",
    "is compared against the models of k41 ( solid line ) , sl94 ( dotted line ) and b02 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the best fit values of @xmath1 , @xmath19 , @xmath18 , @xmath21 and the @xmath26 value are shown in the upper left corner .",
    "a plot of the difference of the fit from the data against @xmath8 is shown as a red solid line in the lower panel.,width=302 ]    the determined parameters of the structure function ( @xmath1 , @xmath19 , @xmath18 and @xmath21 ) for all the clouds and their uncertainties are listed in table[strrestab ] .",
    "the @xmath26 of the fit is also shown .",
    "the values for @xmath1 lie in the range 0.45 to 1.08 with a mean of 0.85@xmath20.16 .",
    "therefore , even after allowing for uncertainties , the values are more or less in the middle of those quoted in the literature ( @xmath1=2/3 in e.g. padoan et al .",
    "@xcite , sl94 , b02 ; @xmath1=1 in e.g. schmidt et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    the co - dimension values @xmath19 lie between 1.18 and 2.51 with a mean of 1.92@xmath20.37 . in turn",
    "the fractal dimension of our sample of clouds has a value of 1.08@xmath20.37 , rendering them filament like rather than sheet like .",
    "the values of @xmath18 ( the degree of non - intermittency ) in our sample range from 0.38 to 0.65 with a mean of 0.53@xmath20.08 .",
    "the literature usually quotes a values for @xmath18 of either 2/3 ( sl94 ) or 1/3 ( b02 ) .",
    "therefore , the value for our gmc sample lies about halfway between these values .    [",

    "the identified peaks appear over a range of scales from 1.5pc ( lupus1 and 2 and ophiuchus ) to 16pc ( cepheus ) .    using the star density instead of the column density maps",
    ", we find peaks in the @xmath1-variance for the clouds auriga1 , circinus , corona australis , @xmath70-ori , ophiuchus , oriona , perseus , serpens and taurus .",
    "in general , the peaks occur at smaller scales ( from 0.5pc in taurus to 10pc in auriga1 ) .",
    "however , only for four clouds ( @xmath70-ori , ophiuchus , oriona , taurus ) do we detect a clear peak in both maps . in each case",
    "we find that the peak determined when using the column density map is larger , indicating that the star density maps trace smaller scales when the @xmath1-variance technique is applied to them .    by means of the _ con - noise _ maps we also measure the mass spectral index scaling exponents @xmath50 for each cloud .",
    "these values and uncertainties are listed in the last two columns of table[strrestab ] .",
    "the listed values are the mean of the results for the three available column density maps .",
    "the values for @xmath50 range from 0.17 ( @xmath70-ori ) to 1.08 ( corona australis ) with a mean for all clouds of 0.54@xmath20.27 .",
    "similar to the investigations of the structure function , we determined the influence of noise on our analysis of the cloud structure with the @xmath1-variance method .",
    "the same noise increments as for the structure function analysis were added to the extinction maps and the change to the peak position of the @xmath1-variance and the mass spectral index scaling exponent were determined .",
    "neither the peak position nor the mass spectral index seem to be significantly and/or systematically influenced , if an additional noise of the level discussed in sect.[noistr ] is added to the extinction maps .",
    "this applies to both , the use of our artificially generated image as well as the real cloud .",
    "hence the obtained values can be considered robust .",
    "the determined average densities of the entire gmcs , as well as the densities of the material above the star formation threshold can be found in table[strrestab ] .",
    "the average densities for the entire cloud range from 1.3@xmath71 ( for monoceros ) to 100@xmath71 ( for serpens ) .",
    "the low value for monoceros might be due to small scale structures not being detected because of the distance to the cloud . for the serpens cloud the apparently high density is due to a general offset in the extinction values ( either foreground or background to the cloud ) . when not considering the very low and very high values , we find a mean value for our sample of about 15@xmath71 , which corresponds to 600@xmath72 .",
    "the densities of material above the star formation threshold are naturally higher .",
    "we find a range from 23@xmath71 ( monoceros ) to 6500@xmath71 ( taurus ) .",
    "the median value is about 750@xmath71 or 3@xmath5810@xmath73@xmath72 . here",
    "the values for the individual clouds should be considered with great care , as we find larger values for clouds with smaller distances , indicating the non - detection of higher column density material in more distant clouds ( due to limited spatial resolution ) and thus an underestimate of the density .",
    "to investigate possible influences of cloud structure on the star formation properties we evaluate the current and potential future amount of star formation of our sample .",
    "\\i ) in paperii ( e.g. bottom left panel of fig.4 ) we found that our sample of clouds can be divided into two groups when considering their column density and mass distribution in the low extinction regions ( a@xmath0 above 1mag and below the star formation threshold ) . we indicate which cloud belongs to which group in table[strrestab ] .",
    "clouds in group1 have a shallow column density and mass distribution while clouds in group2 have a steeper distribution .",
    "hence , group1 members have a larger amount of material at high column densities , and thus more mass potentially available for star formation .",
    "one finds that the average fraction of mass potentially involved in star formation is about two to three times higher for clouds in group1 ( see table4 in paperii ) .",
    "\\ii ) we use literature data to estimate the current number of young stars and mode of star formation for each cloud .",
    "in particular the work by kainulainen et al . and reipurth @xcite have been used .",
    "it turns out that clouds in group1 contain typically more than 100 young stellar objects and the majority of these clouds form at least one cluster of stars .",
    "clouds in group2 on the other hand , typically only form a few tens of stars and no clusters .    thus",
    ", group1 contains clouds which intensely form stars , preferably in a clustered mode , while clouds in group2 show weaker star formation activity mostly in a distributed mode .",
    "taurus , without a known cluster of young stars , seems to be an exception as it belongs to group1 .      for our structure function analysis we selected only pixel values between the self shielding column density threshold of 1mag @xmath3 and the individual star formation threshold for each cloud ( see paperii ) , as this range represents the part of the clouds where turbulence is expected to dominate the structure .",
    "we calculated the structure functions for each cloud using the three _ con - noise _ maps and a spatial scale range from 0.1pc to 1.0pc ( traceable for all clouds ) .    using the data shown in table[strrestab ] we investigated possible correlations between the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath19 against the molecular cloud densities ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) as well as a range of other parameters from table4 of paperii .",
    "no correlations could be found .",
    "the analysis was also performed by considering two separate groups of clouds .",
    "there are no significant differences for any of the structure function parameters between the two groups .",
    "hence , our determined structure functions are not able to distinguish between clouds that form stars in clusters or in a distributed mode",
    ".    one might expect that the values of the co - dimension @xmath19 increase with distance ( i.e. the fractal dimension @xmath21 is decreasing ) , due to the change in appearance of the cloud .",
    "more distant clouds will appear to have a more simplistic structure due to details not being resolved .",
    "however , in our analysis no such trend could be found .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that we determine the structure functions in the scale range 0.1pc to 1.0pc , which is resolved for all investigated clouds .",
    "our mean value for all clouds of @xmath1=0.85@xmath20.16 is much higher than the values of @xmath1=0 expected by k41 .",
    "furthermore , it is inbetween the predictions of @xmath1=2/3 ( sl94 , b02 ) and @xmath1=1.0 ( s08 ) .",
    "however , the scatter in our results means the value could be as low as @xmath1=0.69 or as high as @xmath1=1.01 .",
    "for the parameter @xmath19 our average of 1.92@xmath20.37 is close to the sl94 value of @xmath19=2.0 , while b02 theorised a value of @xmath19=1.0 . in s08 @xmath19",
    "is found to be @xmath761.1 for compressive forcing and @xmath761.5 for solenoidal forcing , both below our average value for the co - dimension .",
    "our average is closer to the predicted value for solenoidal forcing ( in particular considering the uncertainties ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that the average cloud of our sample has a structure function hinting to solenoidal forcing of the turbulent field , rather than compressive driving .      using the @xmath1-variance technique , we identified peaks in plots of @xmath51 against @xmath5 to quantify the scale of structure in our investigated gmcs .",
    "we were only able to find peaks in @xmath51 for about half the clouds . in the remainder",
    "no peaks could be identified .",
    "this could be caused by the fact that there are no dominant scales in those clouds , or that the size of the map around each cloud was too small ( due to neighbouring clouds ) .",
    "note that the @xmath1-variance will only detect dominant scales if they are significantly smaller than the map size .",
    "scales identified average at about 5pc .",
    "these generally correspond to the width of a filament or sheets in the cloud rather than the length or size of the entire cloud . in the region lupus3 , 4 , 5",
    ", 6 the peaks correspond to the length of the different filaments .",
    "when we perform the @xmath1-variance analysis with the star density maps , dominant scales are found as well for about half the clouds .",
    "these scales are smaller and average at about 2pc .",
    "this indicates that the star density maps trace more compact , higher extinction regions , generally the width of dense filaments .    for the mass spectral index scaling exponent @xmath50 , federrath et al .",
    "found values of @xmath50=0.55 for solenoidal forcing of turbulence and @xmath50=1.34 for compressive driving . we find a considerable variation in the measured values for @xmath50 amongst our clouds .",
    "all values are below the predicted amount for pure compressive driving . however , the mean for all clouds is @xmath50=0.54@xmath20.27 , hence very close to the predictions for pure solenoidal driving of turbulence .",
    "when considering the average values of @xmath50 for our two groups of clouds , significant differences can be found . while the cluster forming clouds have an average of @xmath50=0.73@xmath20.18 , the clouds with a more distributed star formation mode have a mean of @xmath50=0.29@xmath20.13 ( or , when excluding the clouds with low correlation coefficient , @xmath50=0.32@xmath20.14 ) .",
    "based on the predictions from federrath et al . , the larger value of @xmath50 for the cluster forming clouds indicates an enhanced component of compressive driving compared to the clouds with a more distributed mode of star formation .",
    "we refrain from trying to estimate a more quantitative statement about the amount of contribution from compressive driving in the cluster forming clouds , since the uncertainties and scatter in our data are clearly large .",
    "we present the homogeneous investigation of a selection of 16 nearby giant molecular clouds .",
    "utilising near infrared extinction maps made from 2mass data with the near infrared colour excess technique , we determine structure functions and perform a @xmath1-variance analysis .",
    "the same clouds as in froebrich & rowles @xcite were investigated .",
    "they are all reasonably nearby , away from the galactic plane , and to the best of our knowledge there is only one cloud along each line of sight .    using our extinction maps",
    "we identify two groups of clouds based on the slope of their column density and mass distributions of the turbulence dominated ( low a@xmath0 ) part of the cloud .",
    "we find that clouds with shallower mass distributions form stars preferably in a clustered mode , while clouds with steep mass distributions form fewer stars and show a more distributed mode of star formation .    structure functions determined for all clouds homogeneously within a range from 0.1pc to 1.0pc can not be used to distinguish clouds with different star formation modes .",
    "comparing the structure function parameters to model calculations suggests that the turbulence in the investigated clouds is governed preferably by solenoidal forcing .",
    "our results of the @xmath1-variance analysis also indicate that the average cloud in our sample is governed by solenoidal forcing .",
    "however , clouds which form a large number of stars in clusters have an enhanced component of compressive driving of the turbulent field , in comparison to clouds with isolated star formation .",
    "hence , compressive driving seems to lead to a more clustered mode of star formation .    to quantify these qualitative findings",
    ", i.e. to determine the fraction of solenoidal and compressive driving in each cloud , a more detailed comparison of the numerical simulations with the observational data needs to be performed .",
    "in particular viewing angle and resolution / distance effects in the model data need to be investigated .",
