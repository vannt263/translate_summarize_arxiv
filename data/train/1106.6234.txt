    "the highly distorted regime of extension @xmath77 is analogous to the fracture process zone observed in various types of systems .",
    "a similar exponential form of the damage profile was recently found for heterogeneous materials where thermal activation does not play a role @xcite .",
    "the authors investigated quasi - brittle fracture processes in the framework of the fuse model gradually increasing the load on notched samples up to failure .",

    "the damage profile proved to have an exponential form similar to our one .",
    "it was argued that micro - cracks concentrate at the crack tip due to the high stress concentration , however , as a counter effect they screen the stress field which then leads to the exponential decay instead of the inverse square root form @xcite .",

    "the deviation from the linear behavior in fig .",
