    "the discussion of optimal control protocols for evolving quantum systems and the relevance of transition speeds and their limits can be traced back to the dawn of quantum theory as can be seen in the example of fermi s golden rule for the mean transition rate into an orthogonal energy eigenstate . while touching fundamental problems about computation _ per se _",
    "@xcite , it is also of technological interest , since minimization of computing time amounts to minimizing the interaction time with detrimental environmental noise sources .",
    "the speed optimization can refer to the transformation of a given initial to a target state , in particular the evolution into an ( arbitrary ) orthogonal state , or it can refer to the implementation of a desired target unitary , which is supposed to act on an arbitrary ( unknown ) quantum state .",
    "the existence of a physical solution to the optimization problem and the formulation of finite speed limits generally require a set of preset constraints which represent practical limitations encountered .",
    "they can be of energetic nature restricting the size of the hamiltonians in some way or refer to the type ( subspace ) of hamiltonians that one can implement .",
    "the latter kind of constraints can be added by lagrange multipliers @xcite giving rise to quantum brachistochrone curves as optimal trajectories of states or unitaries .    besides of this , a fundamental constraint addresses external background fields that can not be manipulated and give rise to a free ( natural ) hamiltonian @xmath0 , which must be taken as given . even in the absence of restrictions on the implementable control hamiltonians @xmath1 ( which would suggest to simply substitute @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 ) ,",
    "the mentioned energetic constraints limit the size of implementable control fields , hence the generic @xmath0 can not be ignored .",
    "this is the motivation for the quantum zermelo navigation problem which , inspired by a result in @xcite , was formulated in @xcite and recently solved in @xcite .    roughly speaking ,",
    "external forces as caused by a background field are incorporated into the problem description as a geometric property by defining an appropriate measure of distance with respect to which one then freely takes a shortest path . in the example of the zermelo navigation problem ,",
    "the solution consists in following the geodesics of a randers metric , which is a special type of finsler metric and can be derived from riemann metrics by adding a linear term .",
    "we refer to @xcite and references therein for a description of the mathematical background .",
    "we here consider the navigation of unitary operators",
    ". starting from a given initial unitary @xmath7 , the task is to find a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath8 that implements a desired final unitary @xmath9 in shortest possible time .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath10 is assumed to consist of a constant part @xmath0 that can not be altered and a time - dependent part @xmath1 which can be controlled by the experimenter without limits except that the size of the control is bounded , so that we set a fixed @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the reference to zermelo originates in the classical problem of finding a time - dependent heading of a ship or aircraft that , starting from some initial location , navigates it to a destination in shortest possible time @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 here corresponds to a wind or current , while a constant @xmath11 $ ] corresponds to the assumption of `` full speed ahead '' at any time . in the classical problem ,",
    "the optimal route under constant wind or current is a straight line from start to finish , which is achieved by keeping a constant correction angle of the vessel s heading with respect to its destination to compensate the drift off .",
    "more general versions of the classical zermelo navigation problem that include obstacles and a wind depending on location and time have also been of recent interest in animal behavior research @xcite and computer science @xcite .",
    "contrary to intuition , the solution of the corresponding quantum problem is _ not _ a constant @xmath1 @xmath12 @xmath4 which would give rise to a ( single - exponential ) one - parameter subgroup of unitaries @xmath13",
    "@xmath3 @xmath14 @xmath3 @xmath15 , but instead an explicit time - dependence such that @xmath16 becomes time - independent in the interaction picture @xcite , @xmath17 and for which the time - optimal curve of unitaries disentangles according to @xmath13 @xmath3 @xmath18 @xmath3 @xmath19 @xmath3 @xmath20 into two exponentials .",

    "time - independence as in the classical case is thus only recovered for @xmath23 $ ] @xmath3 @xmath24 .",
    "zermelo navigation of quantum _ states _ has been solved in @xcite also deriving a limit on the passage time , by tracing it back to the navigation of unitaries .",
    "the energetic constraint here takes the form of a fixed variance @xmath25 .",
    "the special case of time - independent @xmath26 has been discussed in @xcite , placing focus on two - level systems and demonstrating that the treatment is astonishingly nontrivial even with these restrictions .",
    "interestingly , eq.(5 ) in @xcite transforms the state navigation problem @xmath27 @xmath3 @xmath28 ( in its general form ) into that of hitting a ( counter)moving target , @xmath29",
    "@xmath3 @xmath30 , which suggests a close connection to pursuit problems : it advises to move `` straightly '' to where the target will be at the time of arrival .",
    "this is analogous to the classical case of a dog who should straightly move towards the extrapolated target ( her walking master s ) location , rather than intuitively following her snout s direction heading towards the instantaneous location of the target resulting in a longer so - called `` hundekurve '' .    referring to time - independent systems with hamiltonian @xmath16",
    ", @xcite relates speed limits for the implementation of unitaries to a family of bounds on orthogonality times , which are all of the canonical form @xmath31",

    ", we show how the zermelo navigation ( [ zermelo ] ) can be applied to a case of non - markovian evolution of open quantum systems @xcite such that it allows an exact treatment of a set of quantum systems coupled to a common environment .",
    "in contrast to the original motivation for realizing a time - optimal evolution , namely to minimize the temporal accumulation of environment - induced decoherence effects , we demonstrate that zermelo time - optimality can enable a _ deliberate _ environmental coupling , which here serves to mediate a desired system coupling .",
    "this intended utilization of non - markovian ( memory ) properties of the environment thus contrasts the case , where environmental interactions are accompanied with irreversible decoherence .",
    "bath - induced system interactions have been discussed for several years , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "the main focus of these markovian approaches has been on the preparation of entangled many - body steady states @xcite for dissipative quantum computation @xcite and continuous quantum repeaters @xcite .",
    "in contrast , here we consider a navigation of unitaries acting on a set of systems and a shared bath .",
    "starting from the identity ,",
    "@xmath7 @xmath3 @xmath39 , the navigation periodically passes unitaries @xmath40 in which system and bath parts are refactorized .",
    "although the systems never interact directly , the system part of the target unitary contains an environment - induced pairwise system - coupling which is decoherence - free .",
    "all results are independent of the system and bath states and apply exact analytical expressions which do not rely on assumptions such as the weak coupling perturbative approach , rotating wave or markovian approximations .",
    "the present work builds on @xcite , who demonstrate the preparation of nonclassical states such as the ghz - state , cf .",
    "also @xcite .",
    "however , the scheme presented there requires setting @xmath0 @xmath3 @xmath24 to allow for an analytic solution . below we will show that ( a ) it is remarkably the zermelo navigation ( [ zermelo ] ) that enables us to overcome this limitation , allowing for arbitrary @xmath0 . as a consequence , the described protocol of generating bath - mediated system - coupling is time - optimal , a result thus also holding for the schemes in @xcite as a special case of vanishing @xmath0 . based on this , we construct ( b ) a _ state - independent _ speed limit for the refactorization time .",
    "finally , we address the question of reaching an arbitrarily given target @xmath9 . while a single zermelo navigation @xmath13 allows in our case merely the creation of bath - induced pairwise unitary system interactions",
    ", the fact that @xmath13 is a product of two non - commuting exponentials suggests the reachability of a given @xmath9 by concatenation as realized by hamiltonian resets .",
    "the two - exponential form of @xmath13 thus halves the number of required resets .",
    "we will ( c ) provide a numerical proof of principle demonstration , where the systems are three two - level systems ( `` qubits '' ) , and @xmath9 is a toffoli gate . apart from being optimal for quantum error correction , the toffoli gate alone is universal for reversible computing and , together with the hadamard gate , forms a universal set of gates for quantum computing @xcite . while the three qubit - setup here serves as simplest case going beyond pairwise system interactions , it is hence already sufficient as building block for universal quantum computation .",
