    "the structure of exotic nuclei , i.e. , nuclei with extreme isospin values , is one of the most exciting challenges in low - energy nuclear physics today .",
    "detailed theoretical studies of exotic nuclei , when confronted with experiments , will yield important information about the interaction between nucleons in the nucleus and the validity of our models for the structure of nuclei .",
    "in addition , the study of exotic nuclei is essential to many fundamental issues in physics today ; in particular , the weak interaction and nuclear astrophysics . for example , it is believed that many of the heavy elements in the universe are produced by the radiative capture of neutrons ( _ r_-process )  @xcite or protons ( _ rp_-process )  @xcite on unstable nuclei .",
    "the competition between beta decay and particle capture traces out a path that synthesizes the known elements .",
    "the details of this path , and , hence , the abundance of the elements produced , depends on the temperature of the site , as well as explicit nuclear properties such as binding energies , level densities , spectroscopic factors , and beta - decay lifetimes .",
    "an additional new feature of proton - rich nuclei that will be explored in the next few years is the possibility of a new decay mode known as diproton emission . because of the pairing interaction , a nucleus with an even number of protons",
    "@xmath4 is generally more tightly bound than a @xmath5 nucleus , but , because of the symmetry energy and coulomb repulsion , it may be unbound relative to the @xmath6 system . the number of candidates for the observation of this decay mode , however , is sharply limited by the two - proton separation energy .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that @xmath7 emission is a competing decay mechanism , and , because of the large coulomb energy difference between the parent and daughter nuclei , the beta - decay lifetimes are of the order 1 - 100  ms .",
    "in addition , a further constraint on the observation of diproton emission can be imposed by the experimental apparatus , since , in many experiments , the parent nucleus must live long enough to be identified . generally speaking ,",
    "these two practical constraints limit the observable lifetime for diproton decay to @xmath8  s. on the other hand , the decay rate for diproton emission is determined by the probability to penetrate through the coulomb barrier , which , in turn , is exponentially dependent on the two - proton separation energy .",
    "as will be shown here , the number of candidates for which the observation of diproton decay is practical , is limited to nuclei with two - proton separation energies between 0.9 and 1.4  mev .",
    "one of the principal motivations for the construction of radioactive beam facilities is to study the properties of nuclei near the limits of stability .",
    "very few nuclei near the proton drip - line have been identified , and the heaviest and most proton - rich nucleus observed to date is @xmath9ni  @xcite .",
    "even more difficult than the identification of an exotic nucleus is the measurement of its mass , and , at present , predictions regarding the _ r_- and _ rp_-process , must rely on theoretical estimates for nuclear binding energies .",
    "several methods have been used to obtain theoretical estimates for absolute binding energies .",
    "one is the liquid - drop formula and associated variants , such as the microscopic - macroscopic approach  @xcite . in general ,",
    "these models are determined by fitting a set of liquid - drop parameters while including effects due to pairing and shell corrections to experimental data over a wide range of nuclei , and have been found to reproduce known nuclear masses at the level of approximately 800  kev ( see for example ref .",
    "although the microscopic - macroscopic approach gives a good global description of nuclear binding energies and is the method of choice for heavy nuclei where detailed microscopic calculations are not feasible , there are notable discrepancies between experimental and calculated binding energies with neutron number between 20 and 40 , as is illustrated in fig . 1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite .    for lighter nuclei",
    ", however , more accurate binding energies can be achieved using the nuclear shell model , since , in many cases , it is necessary only to compute the coulomb energy difference between mirror nuclei  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "coulomb energy differences are computed for mirror nuclei in the _ fp _ shell for @xmath10 . by then making use of experimental data for the neutron - rich members tabulated in ref .",
    "@xcite , absolute binding energies are predicted with an estimated accuracy at the level of @xmath11  kev . with these binding energies ,",
    "two - proton separation energies are computed and rough estimates for the lifetimes for diproton decay are made .",
    "given the practical constraints on the decay halflives mentioned above , it is found that the best candidates for the experimental observation of correlated two - proton emission are @xmath1fe , @xmath2ni , and @xmath3se .",
    "this paper is organized into five sections . in section",
    "[ sec : coul ] , the systematics of coulomb energy differences between analog nuclei are discussed , while in section  [ sec : shell ] a shell - model description of these energy shifts is presented .",
    "candidates for the exotic decay mode known as di - proton emission are presented and analyzed in section  [ sec : diproton ] , and concluding remarks are collected in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "if the nuclear hamiltonian is composed of only one- and two - body parts , quite generally , it may be separated into three components . the dominant part , which is also responsible for most of the nuclear binding energy , is due to the strong interaction and is isoscalar in nature .",
    "the other two components are due to both the coulomb interaction and charge non - symmetric parts of the nucleon - nucleon interaction , and are isovector and isotensor in character .",
    "if the isovector and isotensor components are weak relative to the isoscalar component , then the binding energies for the members of an isospin multiplet may be obtained within the context of the isobaric mass multiplet equation ( imme )  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the isospin and its third component for the members of the isospin multiplet , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the number of protons , neutrons , and nucleons , respectively .",
    "the label @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ e : imme ] ) represents all other quantum numbers needed to denote the state , such as angular momentum , state number , etc .",
    "the coefficients @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 separately depend on the isoscalar  @xcite , isovector , and isotensor components of the nuclear hamiltonian , respectively .    in shell - model calculations ,",
    "the isoscalar part of the nuclear hamiltonian is usually determined empirically by fitting to experimental binding energies and levels that have had the coulomb energy subtracted off in an average way  ( c.f .",
    "the predictive power of these effective hamiltonians is indicated by the rms deviation between experimental data and calculated binding energies , and , to date , the best empirically determined hamiltonian is that due to wildenthal  @xcite for use in the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 orbitals , where the rms deviation between theory and experiment is of the order 200  kev . for the most part , this interaction",
    "may be thought of as indicative of the best accuracy that may be achieved within the framework of the nuclear shell model . for other model spaces , such as the _ fp_-shell ( defined by the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 orbitals ) , the effective shell - model hamiltonian is less well determined and the deviation between theory and experiment is somewhat larger and is of the order 300  kev  @xcite . with this in mind , we must conclude that any attempt to compute absolute binding energies from first principles in the shell model would include an uncertainty of at least 200 - 300  kev in the @xmath19 coefficient of eq .",
    "( [ e : imme ] ) .    from eq .",
    "( [ e : imme ] ) , the binding energy difference between iosbaric analogs with @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 therefore , the most accurate way to predict absolute binding energies for proton - rich nuclei whose analog has an experimentally measured mass is to compute the @xmath20-coefficient for the multiplet ( or the coulomb energy difference ) and add @xmath31 to the experimental binding energy , @xmath32 , of the neutron - rich analog .",
    "the overall uncertainty in the predicted binding energy is then of the order @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the uncertainty in the @xmath20-coefficient and @xmath35 is the uncertainty in the experimental binding energy . in many cases ,",
    "it is possible to estimate the @xmath20-coefficient with an uncertainty of the order 30 - 40  kev  @xcite , and , therefore , it may be possible to predict the binding energies of extreme proton - rich nuclei at the level of 100 - 200  kev .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the procedure outlined above was used to predict the absolute binding energies of nuclei with @xmath36 .",

    "( [ e : diff ] ) was evaluated using a method based on a parameterization of the coulomb displacement energies  @xcite .",
    "the overall success of these works , and agreement between them , is essentially due to their empirical foundations . in each ,",
    "a set of parameters was fit to experimental data , and the models were then extrapolated to predict the masses of unknown nuclei .",
    "this work is an extension of ref .",
    "@xcite in which absolute binding energies of proton - rich nuclei with @xmath10 are predicted by computing the coulomb displacements within the framework of the nuclear shell model .    before continuing with the details and the results of the shell - model calculations , it is instructive to examine the systematic behavior of the coulomb displacement energies . indeed , one of the reasons for the success of the three different methods is the smooth behavior as a function of nucleon number @xmath37 exhibited by experimental @xmath20-coefficients .",
    "in addition , for a given mass number , the @xmath20-coefficients are essentially constant to within 100  kev or so , as can be seen from tables 3 - 7 in ref .",
    "this behavior is easily understood from the liquid - drop model , where the coulomb energy of a sphere of radius @xmath38 with charge @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 the coulomb energy difference between analog nuclei is then @xmath41 = \\frac{3}{5 } \\frac{e^2}{r}a(z - n)\\\\ & = & \\frac{3}{5 } \\frac{e^2}{r}2at = \\frac{3}{5 } \\frac{e^2}{r_0}a^{2/3}(2 t ) , \\label{e : de_ld}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and the isospin is defined by @xmath42 .",

    ", deviations from constancy can be expected for two reasons .",
    "first , in some cases single - particle orbits from different major oscillator shells come into play , as in @xmath60 , and second , near the limits of stability , the single - particle orbits are nearly unbound , and the thomas - erhman shift  @xcite needs to be accounted for ( see section  [ sec : shell ] ) .    from fig .

    "it is necessary to account for local nuclear structure via a microscopic model , which is the topic of the next section .",
    "in this section , the procedure for computing the coulomb energy difference between analog nuclei within the framework of the shell model is outlined . in ref .",
    "@xcite , empirical isovector and isotensor , or isospin - nonconserving ( inc ) , hamiltonians were determined for several shell - model spaces by constraining them to reproduce experimental @xmath20- and @xmath21-coefficients .",
    "the primary components of the empirical interactions were the coulomb interaction and two - body isovector and isotensor interactions .",
    "in general , the empirical two - body isovector interaction was rather weak , while the isotensor interaction was found to to be consistent with the differences observed in the proton - proton and proton - neutron scattering lengths .",
    "the deviations between theoretical and experimental @xmath20 and @xmath21 coefficients were of the order of 30  kev and 15  kev , respectively .    in this work , proton - rich nuclei in the mass range @xmath64",
    "are investigated . for all but two cases ( the @xmath65 , @xmath66 isodoublet and the @xmath67 , @xmath68 isotriplet ) ,",
    "the binding energy of the neutron - rich analog has been measured and is tabulated in ref .",
    "the shell - model calculations were performed using the shell - model code oxbash  @xcite in proton - neutron formalism using the configuration space defined by the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 orbitals ( the _ fp _ shell ) and the fpd6 hamiltonian given in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , instead of computing the @xmath20-coefficients ,",
    "the `` coulomb '' energy differences between analogs were computed directly by adding the inc interaction to the fpd6 hamiltonian . due to the large dimensions present ,",
    "some truncations on the model space were found to be necessary . for @xmath69 ,",
    "all configurations contained within the @xmath25 and @xmath27 orbits were included , and the truncations were based on the number of particles permitted to be excited out of the @xmath25 and @xmath27 orbits into the @xmath26 and @xmath28 orbits . generally , this ranged from two to four particles so that the total dimensions ( with good angular momentum ) were less than 14,000 . for @xmath70 ,",
    "the @xmath25 orbit was taken to be a closed core , and the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 single - particle energies of the fpd6 interaction were modified so as to reproduce the levels of @xmath71ni under this assumption . for the most part , it was found that the coulomb energy shifts were not particularly sensitive to the applied truncations , and in a few cases where the effects of the truncations were tested , differences of only a few kev were found .",
    "therefore , the applied model - space truncations are not expected to provide a significant contribution to the uncertainty in the computed binding energies .",
    "the inc interaction used here consists of a coulomb plus charge - dependent ( isotensor ) interaction , and is described in detail in ref .",
    "an important parameter for this interaction is the oscillator frequency , @xmath72 , since the coulomb components are scaled as a function of @xmath37 by the factor  @xcite @xmath73^{1/2},\\ ] ] generally , @xmath72 is chosen to reproduce experimental rms charge radii , and for many nuclei it can be accurately parameterized by @xmath74 it is important to note , however , that for @xmath75 , eq .  ( [ e : hbw ] ) underestimates @xmath72 as compared to values derived from experimental charge radii . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite the value of 10.222  mev was used for @xmath76 as opposed to the value of 10.208  mev implied by eq .",
    "( [ e : hbw ] ) .",
    "in addition , the _",
    "fp_-shell inc interaction was refit in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that better overall agreement between theoretical and experimental coulomb energy shifts was obtained using oscillator frequencies derived from the rms charge radii of hartree - fock calculations using the skyrme m@xmath77 interaction .",
    "these values of @xmath72 are tabulated in table  [ tab:1 ] , and are used in the present work .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the fitted inc interactions were able to reproduce the experimental @xmath20-coefficients for _ fp_-shell nuclei with an rms deviation of approximately 33  kev .",
    "however , the most difficult parameters to determine for the inc interaction are the coulomb single - particle energies for the @xmath26 and @xmath28 orbits , as there is very little experimental data available that is sensitive to these quantities . in ref .",
    "@xcite , these single - particle energies were fit upon by making assumptions regarding spin assignments for excited levels in @xmath71cu and @xmath78zn .",
    "in retrospect , these levels are probably not appropriate for determining parameters for heavier nuclei because of uncertainties in spin assignments and the fact that the levels comprising the assumed doublet at 1.040  mev in @xmath71cu  @xcite are unbound , and strong thomas - ehrman shifts  @xcite may apply ( see below ) . also , shell - model calculations for the @xmath79 and @xmath80 states in @xmath78zn indicate that these levels are predominantly @xmath81 configurations . on the other hand ,",
    "the the beta - endpoint energies for both @xmath82ga  @xcite and @xmath83as  @xcite are sensitive to the @xmath26 coulomb single - particle energy and were used to help fix this parameter . in regards to the @xmath28 single - particle energy , however , no data exists that will definitively set this parameter .",
    "for this reason , the value obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , which also happens to reproduce the @xmath20-coefficients for the assumed @xmath84 states in @xmath85 and 59 , is used .",
    "two additional concerns that affect this work are : ( 1 ) whether the _ fp_-shell alone is sufficient to describe the nuclei in question , and ( 2 ) the effect of the thomas - ehrman shift on the coulomb displacement energies near the drip line . as a measure of the appropriateness of just the _ fp_-shell for the calculations , we examine the the excitation energies of the first @xmath86 states in @xmath87 , even - even nuclei in the region @xmath88 . shown in table  [ tab:2 ] ,",
    "are the experimental  @xcite excitation energies of the these states in comparison with the values obtained with the fpd6@xmath77 interaction ( fpd6 modified as indicated above after closing the @xmath25 orbit ) .",
    "overall , there is good agreement between the calculated and experimental values until @xmath89 , where there is a sudden drop in the excitation energy , which is an indication of the onset of collective behavior that would necessitate the inclusion of orbits from the next major shell , such as the @xmath90 orbit .",
    "given the results in table  [ tab:2 ] , the _",
    "fp_-shell is sufficient to describe the nuclei studied in this work .",
    "in general , coulomb energies are computed using harmonic oscillator , or sometimes bound woods - saxon , single - particle wave functions for the protons , with the length scale chosen to reproduce experimental rms charge radii .",
    "near the drip line , however , this approximation can be inadequate .",
    "because they are loosely bound , the proton single - particle wavefunctions are pushed out of the nuclear interior , and , as a consequence , the coulomb energy is reduced .",
    "this shift in the coulomb energy was first noted by thomas  @xcite and ehrman  @xcite in the @xmath91 system , and is most important for light nuclei where the coulomb barrier , which acts to confine the wave function in the nuclear interior , is smaller , and for orbits with little or no centrifugal barrier , eg . ,",
    "the @xmath92 orbitals .",
    "this effect is well illustrated by the single - particle states in @xmath93 , where the coulomb displacement energy of the @xmath94 ( the @xmath22 orbit ) ground state is 3.543  mev , while the shift for the @xmath95 state , which is a @xmath24 single - particle state that is bound by only 107  kev , is 3.168  mev .",
    "the influence of the centrifugal barrier is also apparent in these nuclei , as the coulomb shift for the @xmath96 state ( the @xmath23 spin - orbit partner of the ground state ) , which is unbound by 4.5  mev , is 3.561  mev .",
    "on theoretical grounds , there are also self - consistent calculations  @xcite that suggest that thomas - ehrman shifts for nuclei near the drip line may be as large a few hundred kev . because of the empirical nature of the inc interaction , however , it is not clear how much of the thomas - ehrman effect has been absorbed into the interaction by fit .",
    "in addition , for nuclei near the drip - line , the estimate of the theoretical uncertainty is of the order of a 100 - 250  kev , and the effects of the thomas - ehrman shift are likely to lie within the quoted uncertainties for the absolute binding energy .",
    "the parameters for the inc interaction used in this work are : @xmath97  mev , @xmath98  mev , @xmath99  mev , @xmath100  mev , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .",
    "lastly , because of the difficulties associated with determining the @xmath26 and @xmath27 single - particle energies , the uncertainties in the theoretical estimates of the @xmath20-coefficients for nuclei with @xmath70 are increased from 33  kev to 45  kev .    shown in table  [ tab:3 ]",

    "while the results of refs .",
    "@xcite are in agreement with those reported here , those of mller and nix are in severe disagreement for some nuclei .",
    "the origin of these differences is two fold .",
    "first , in the mller - nix study , the coulomb - energy difference between analog nuclei is considerably smaller than in this work .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , where the @xmath20-coefficients for the nuclei listed in table  [ tab:3 ] ( open triangles ) are plotted as a function of @xmath37 in comparison with those derived from the mller - nix masses ( solid squares ) . in the mass region @xmath111",
    "the mller - nix @xmath20-coefficients are generally 100 - 200 kev smaller than those determined here .",
    "in addition , the mller - nix @xmath20-coefficients are also in disagreement experimental trends , as is evidenced by the @xmath78zn-@xmath78cu binding energy differences , where the mller - nix @xmath20-coefficient is 9.683  mev , which is 200  kev smaller than the experimental value of 9.881(40 )  mev  @xcite .",
    "the second reason for the large disagreement in fig .",

    "this section is concluded with a discussion on @xmath126as , which is important from an astrophysical point of view .",
    "because of the long beta - decay halflife for @xmath127ge , if @xmath126as were significantly proton unbound , @xmath127ge would then become a `` waiting point '' in the _ rp_-process and would inhibit the production of heavier elements . if , however , the halflife of @xmath126as is dominated by beta decay , the",

    "@xcite , the initial nucleus must live long enough to be identified . in this case , the limiting time is determined by the time - of - flight in the experimental apparatus . in general , these two conditions impose a practical limit on the observable halflife for di - proton emission to be in the range @xmath8  s.    in refs .",

    "@xcite that an uncertainty of @xmath159  kev in a separation energy of the order 500  kev can lead to a range of nearly six orders of magnitude in the di - proton decay halflife .",
    "in contrast , the spectroscopic factors are expected to be of the order 0.5 - 0.75  @xcite , and should nt lead to any more than an order of magnitude decrease in the decay rate ( increase in the halflife ) .",
    "given that the theoretical uncertainties in the separation energy for each of the di - proton emitters considered in this work are all greater than 175  kev , an accurate estimate of the spectroscopic factor is not needed in order to obtain an order - of - magnitude estimate of the di - proton halflife for the purpose of identifying the best candidates for experimental observation .",
    "hence , the lifetimes reported here are evaluated assuming @xmath160 with the understanding that they are probably too short by a factor of two to four .",

    "the shell - model binding energies predicted here were also compared with three previous works . while the results of ormand  @xcite ( only for @xmath109 ) and cole  @xcite ( only for @xmath110 ) are in good agreement with those reported here , those of mller and nix  @xcite are not .",
    "it was found that the disagreement with the mller - nix masses is due to differences in both the coulomb energy shifts and the binding energy of the neutron - rich analog .",
