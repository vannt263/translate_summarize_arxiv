    "the statistical features of coupled systems have attracted considerable interest in many branches of physics . random matrix theory ( rmt )",
    "has been successfully used in many of those investigations .",
    "rmt was founded by wigner  @xcite .",
    "it is a schematic model  @xcite in which the hamiltonian , or , more generally , the wave operator of the system , is replaced by a random matrix .",
    "the necessary prerequisite is that the system be sufficiently `` complex , '' implying that the matrix elements of the hamiltonian , or wave operator , calculated in an arbitrary basis , behave like random numbers .",
    "it has been shown that the spectral fluctuations in numerous different systems , if measured on the scale of the local mean - level spacing , are very well modeled by rmt ; see the reviews in refs .",
    "@xcite . due to the connection with chaos",
    ", one frequently refers to those systems as quantum chaotic which show correlations of rmt type .",
    "similarly , systems are often referred to as regular if they lack spectral correlations .",
    "we consider two coupled systems .",
    "we assume that either the two systems are chaotic before they are coupled or that the coupling itself introduces chaoticity if the separate systems are regular .",
    "this scenario is equivalent to the breaking of symmetries , if only two values of the quantum number belonging to that symmetry are taken into account .",
    "the statistical features crucially depend on the strength of the coupling measured on the scale of the local mean - level spacing .",
    "many studies have been devoted to this issue of chaotically coupled systems or , equivalently , to symmetry breaking .",
    "we mention isospin breaking in nuclear physics  @xcite , symmetry breaking in molecular physics  @xcite , symmetry breaking in resonating quartz crystals  @xcite and coupled microwave billiards  @xcite . while these studies addressed the spectral correlation , several investigations in nuclear physics  @xcite focused on the statistics of the wave functions and related observables in the presence of symmetry breaking or similar effects . in all these cases , rmt approaches in the spirit of the rosenzweig - porter model",
    "@xcite were successful .",
    "sometimes observables in the time domain such as spectral form factors are more appropriate than the eigenenergy correlations functions  @xcite .",
    "this is so , for example , in the case of the presently much discussed fidelity ; see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "another example is the study of the energy spread in chaotic systems  @xcite . in the context of coupled systems ,",
    "the time evolution of wave packets was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present contribution",
    ", we study energy localization in two coupled systems in the time domain .",
    "this problem was addressed in a recent work by weaver and lobkis  @xcite who measured the time dependence of the wave intensity distribution in two coupled reverberation rooms . to this end , these authors recorded the time response to an elastic excitation of two coupled aluminum cubes .",
    "moreover , they investigated the same problem theoretically and they numerically calculated the response in coupled two - dimensional membranes . in our study , we se tup and analyze an rmt model , based on the approaches in refs .",
    "its general character makes our model useful for similar problems in different physics contexts .",
    "in particular , we expect that our rmt approach also applies to coupled quantum dots .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp_and_model ] we sketch the work of weaver and lobkis  @xcite . in sec .",

    "[ sec : dic_concl ] .",
    "as we aim at a comparison with their findings , we present the work of weaver and lobkis  @xcite in some detail .",
    "thereby , we also introduce the notation and conventions .",
    "the system studied experimentally consists of two aluminum cubes coupled by a solid connection , manufactured out of a solid aluminum block .",
    "the corners of the cubes were removed to desymmetrize the structure .",
    "this was done to ensure `` chaotic '' motion .",
    "elastomechanical wave modes were excited in one room , and the response was measured in the other room . in this way , 16 different curves of energy intensity versus time were recorded , each in a small region around a different frequency .",
    "the results show that the energy does not always spread equally over the two rooms . if the coupling is weak , then the wave intensity is higher in the room where the initial excitation was performed than in the other room , regardless of how long one waits .",
    "hence , the energy ratio never approaches unity .",
    "this deviation from the equipartition of the energy in the two rooms is referred to as energy localization .",
    "the resulting data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wl_exp ] , and as expected there is localization in the bins of larger mean - level spacing , but not in the bins of small mean - level spacing .",
    "we will discuss these results further in sec .",
    "[ sec : rmt_result ] .",
    "two numerical studies were performed on membranes with rough boundaries  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the system was in both cases governed by discretized wave equations in each of the rooms , and the coupling was realized in different ways in the two numerical calculations , to which we refer as n1 and n2 in the sequel .",
    "in the first one , n1 , the connection had the form of a window between the two membranes similar to the situation in the experimental setup . in the second numerical calculation , n2 , the rooms were separated , but springs were attached to a few different sites in rooms 1 and 2 , thereby coupling those sites . in n1 and n2 ,",
    "a nonvanishing initial condition was given to one site in one of the rooms , and the response was calculated at different sites in the other room .",
    "the resulting time series were cosine - bell time windowed to focus on a specific instant in time .",
    "then , the time series were fourier transformed and integrated over a small region in frequency to accumulate data around a certain frequency . as in the experiment",
    ", 16 different curves of intensity versus time were obtained around different frequencies . at different frequencies ,",
    "the systems have different effective couplings . therefore",
    ", one expects  @xcite the time behavior of the different curves to differ in the degree of localization , as well as in the way in which this asymptotic saturation value is reached . due to the differences in the coupling mechanism , there will also be differences between the results of n1 and n2 .",
    "moreover , weaver and lobkis performed an analytical model study .",
    "the elastic wave equation for the state of the system @xmath0 , say , is of second order in time . to focus on the response in a narrow interval around a certain frequency @xmath1 , the ansatz @xmath2 is made with the assumption that @xmath3 varies slowly with time",
    "this leads to a first - order differential equation in time for @xmath3 which has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the wave operator of the original second - order equation .",
    "the energies @xmath6 and @xmath7 in rooms 1 and 2 at time @xmath8 are defined as the total probability density of finding the system state @xmath3 in one of the states @xmath9 , which are good eigenstates in room @xmath10 : @xmath11 strictly speaking , @xmath12 is no energy .",
    "nevertheless , we find this terminology introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite appropriate and use it as well , because @xmath12 measures the degree of motion in room @xmath10 .",
    "if no energy dissipates into the surrounding environment , the total energy @xmath13 is conserved ",
    "i.e. , independent of time . in the sequel",
    ", it is always assumed that the system is excited in room 1 , and the energy is measured in room 2 .",
    "analytical solutions for two coupled states are presented in ref .",

    "thus , rmt is also likely to be capable of modeling the time behavior of elastomechanical systems .",

    ", we gave an estimate of the strong coupling behavior which involved the two - level goe form factor .",
    "moreover , we studied the @xmath14 version of our rmt model analytically for arbitrary coupling strength and performed numerical simulations for the @xmath25 version .    from the comparison with the work of weaver and lobkis , we conclude that the rmt model yields a good qualitative description .",
    "moreover , we find an interpretation of the localization effect by relating it to the universal features of rmt models for crossover transitions .    formally similar rmt models have been studied in connection with symmetry breaking .",
    "then , the parameter @xmath23 measures the degree of symmetry breaking .",
    "this is so for isospin breaking in nuclear physics  @xcite , symmetry breaking in molecular physics  @xcite , and symmetry breaking in resonating quartz crystals  @xcite .",
    "the experiment that comes closest to the present situation is the study of spectral correlations in coupled microwave billiards  @xcite . in this work and in the experiment of weaver and lobkis  @xcite , an excitation initially in system one would stay there for all times if the coupling is zero",
    "this is formally analogous to a conserved quantum number .    in the rmt model",
    "the parameter measuring the size of the connection has a most natural counterpart : the root - mean - square matrix element due to the coupling measured on the scale of the local mean - level spacing .",
    "thus , there are two ways of making the effective , dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath81 small and to thereby introduce localization : either the original coupling parameter @xmath23 which always has a dimension is small or the mean - level spacing @xmath54 is made large .",
    "it might be surprising that no equipartition of the energy is seen for all coupling strengths even if one waits very long",
    ". this would be the expectation if one compares the system with two water basins coupled by a channel .",
    "suppose that initially the two basins are empty and the channel is closed by a gate .",
    "now one of the basins is filled with water and the gate is opened at @xmath40 . obviously , the water levels in the two basins will be equal after sufficiently long time .",
    "the speed with which this equipartition is reached simply depends on the cross section of the channel .    in the present case of the two coupled acoustic rooms",
    "the situation is different , because the wave character of the excitations has to be taken into account .",
    "thus , the crucial parameter entering is the size of the coupling connection ",
    "i.e. , its geometrical width  compared to a typical wavelength .",
    "the first waves after the excitation which come from system 1 into system 2 enter a silent territory and cause the first excitations there .",
    "the next waves coming from system 1 , however , encounter these first excitations in system 2 and interfere with them constructively or destructively .",
    "this process continues and , of course , after being excited in system 2 , waves also travel back into system 1 . for smaller times , this complicated dynamics certainly depends strongly on the realization of the coupling .",
    "this is clearly so in the numerical calculation of ref .",
    "nevertheless , the loneg - time behavior , in particular the saturation limit , shows universal characteristics , consistent with general features of quantum chaotic systems ; see ref .",
    "@xcite . in the energy domain , this is borne out in the fact that the correlations on smaller energy scales are described by universal rmt features , while system - specific properties show up on larger scales , leading to deviations from the rmt prediction . to avoid confusion ,",
    "we emphasize that these universal rmt features include those in the presence of symmetry breaking . by system - specific properties we mean , most importantly , the scales set by the shortest periodic orbits .",
    "it is worthwhile to realize that the chaoticity of the individual subsystems before the coupling is not crucial , if the coupling itself introduces enough chaos .",
    "we tested numerically that the behavior of the corresponding model for two regular subsystems coupled chaotically shows the same qualitative behavior .",
    "the saturation value is reached slightly faster , which simply means that time is rescaled . finally , we mention that our model is not restricted to elastomechanics",
    ". it would also apply to coupled quantum dots and other coupled systems .",
    "this project was prompted by a conversation between r.l .",
    "weaver and one of the present authors ( t.g . ) during a workshop at the centro internacional de ciencias ( cic / unam ) , cuernavaca , mexico .",
