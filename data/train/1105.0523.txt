    "the modelling of social behaviour is of increasing concern to statistical physicists @xcite .",
    "studies of social and biological systems often reveal that even when the interactions of a given individual are very localised in time and space , collective , regular behaviour can emerge : this is analogous to the cooperative behaviour manifested by emergent systems in the natural world .",
    "such social regularities may well take the form of _ learning _",
    ", when individuals adopt the behaviour of other individuals .",
    "from the perspective of game theory @xcite , this can be seen as an adoption of a particular _ strategy _ , whose result may or may not be associated with a favourable outcome .",
    "it is then quite reasonable to expect that the effectiveness of a strategy in yielding favourable outcomes should influence how likely it is to persist , and spread through the population ; the resulting ideas of _ strategic learning _ @xcite have found wide application , starting from economics @xcite to cognitive science @xcite .    against the backdrop of the above ideas , a model of strategic learning",
    "was introduced in @xcite , with one of two possible strategies ( denoted as @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the remainder of this paper ) being available to each agent on a lattice : the agents were referred to as ` myopic ' ( aware only of their immediate neighbours ) and ` memoryless ' ( unaware of their own and others past outcomes ) in the paper on technology diffusion @xcite that inspired the above model @xcite .",
    "the question on which this body of work has centred is : despite these handicaps , can agents overall learn to use the superior one of two available technologies ?",
    "briefly , each agent changes ( or does not change ) strategy based on two elementary rules at every time step : a _ majority - based _ rule , reflecting its tendency to align with its local neighbourhood , followed by a _ performance - based _ rule , where the agent adopts the strategy that ` wins ' in its neighbourhood .",
    "this ( relative ) success is measured in terms of _ outcomes _ , where the probability of a successful outcome for strategy @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) is @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "also , the model of @xcite added to the description of  @xcite by endowing the agents with memory : those agents who make their choices on the basis of the last payoff alone , are adjudged to be memoryless ( with a corresponding parameter @xmath4 near @xmath5 ) , while those who allow for memories of earlier outcomes may make decisions that run counter to immediate evidence ( @xmath4 small ) .",
    "some related ideas have been examined in recent work .",
    "for example , the issue of consensus formation in a model of threshold learning @xcite shows close analogies : in this model , the competition between the ` noisy ' signals from the immediate neighbours of an agent ( cf .",
    "the majority rule in @xcite ) and the acceptance threshold that agents require to change their state ( cf .",
    "the memory threshold in the performance - based rule of @xcite ) , determine the phase diagrams obtained .",
    "recent studies of coevolving glauber dynamics on networks @xcite are also relevant , since the model of @xcite can be viewed as a competition between the glauber dynamics of two sets of ising spins , corresponding to strategy and outcome respectively .    in the current paper , we take all these ideas further .",
    "first , we explore the effect of different updates .",
    "if new information propagates _ sequentially _ through the network , and the arrow of time is discernible in the decisions of individual agents , are the global phase diagrams any different from what they would be if information was transmitted and all decisions were taken _",
    "simultaneously _ ?",
    "common sense tells us that sequential or parallel updates _ should _ make a difference to the nature of the phase diagram , and the results of the present paper confirm this . also ( unlike the work of @xcite which examined the situation at coexistence ) we look in this paper at the effects of disparate strategies ( @xmath6 )",
    ". the final , and possibly most important issue , is that of memory , which acts as a threshold governing change @xcite : what is the effect of the threshold @xmath4 , which tells the agent that longer - term inputs are significant , and need to be considered when making a decision ?",
    "we will find that , indeed , a longer memory of earlier outcomes can sometimes make up for the choice of a globally inferior strategy .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ defsection ] , we review the model of @xcite . in section",
    "[ updates ] , we discuss the behaviour of the model for a range of updating schemes , in the presence of memory . in section  [ away ] , we examine the behaviour of the model away from coexistence , as a function of _ distinct _ parameter values for the two strategies ; in particular we discuss here the role of memory . in the concluding section",
    ", we discuss our results and put them in the context of other recent work in the field .",
    "the model of @xcite involves two types of strategies , @xmath1 and @xmath0 , where the @xmath0 strategy is globally superior @xcite to the @xmath1 strategy . as mentioned above ,",
    "agents tend to follow the strategy adopted by the majority of their neighbours , modifying this choice in a second step ( if necessary ) according to which of these have proved to be the most successful .    assuming that the agents sit at the nodes of a _",
    "d_-dimensional regular lattice with coordination number @xmath7 , the efficiency of an agent at site _",
    "i _ is represented by an ising spin variable : @xmath8 the evolution dynamics of the lattice is governed by two rules .",
    "the first is a _ majority _ rule , which consists of the alignment of an agent with the local field ( created by its nearest neighbours ) acting upon it , according to : @xmath9{w.p}\\frac{1}{2 } & \\mbox{if}\\ & h_{i}(t)=0,\\\\-1 &     &   \\mbox{if}\\ & h_{i}(t)<0 .",
    "\\end{array } \\right .\\ ] ] here , the local field @xmath10 is the sum of the efficiencies of the @xmath11 neighbouring agents @xmath12 of site @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the associated time step .",
    "next , a _ performance _ rule is applied .",
    "this starts with the assignment of an outcome @xmath15 ( another ising - like variable , with values of @xmath16 corresponding to success and failure respectively ) to each site @xmath13 , according to the following rules : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the associated time step and @xmath19 are the probabilities of having a successful outcome for the corresponding strategy . with @xmath20 and @xmath21 denoting the total number of neighbours of a site _",
    "i _ who have adopted strategies @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) denoting the number of successful outcomes within the set @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , the dynamical rules for site _",
    "i _ are : @xmath24    here , the ratios @xmath25 are nothing but the average payoff assigned by an agent to each of the two strategies in its neighbourhood at time @xmath26 ( assuming that success yields a payoff of unity and failure , zero ) .",
    "also , @xmath27 is the associated time step and the parameters @xmath28 are indicators of the memory associated with each strategy . in their full generality , @xmath4 and @xmath29 are independent variables : the choice of a particular strategy can be associated with either a short or a long memory . however , we would like in this paper to answer a question which was posed , but not answered in @xcite : can the presence of a good memory compensate for the choice of an inferior strategy ? we therefore examine the extreme situation when a globally superior strategy ( @xmath30 ) , combined with a shorter memory ( @xmath31 ) is in competition with its inverse : this is the situation that will be studied in section  [ away ] .    setting the timescales @xmath32 the above steps of the performance rule are recast as effective dynamical rules involving the efficiencies @xmath33 and the associated local fields alone : @xmath34}\\\\-1\\   & \\mbox{w.p.}\\   & \\mbox{1-$w_+$[$h_{i}(t)$]},\\end{array}\\right .\\nonumber\\\\ \\mbox{if}\\   \\eta_{i}(t)= -1,\\nonumber\\\\ \\mbox{then}\\   \\eta_{i}(t+1 ) & = \\left\\lbrace\\begin{array}{ccc}+1\\   & \\mbox{w.p . } & \\mbox{$w_-$[$h_{i}(t)$]}\\\\-1\\   & \\mbox{w.p.}\\   & \\mbox{1-$w_-$[$h_{i}(t)$]}.\\end{array}\\right .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the effective transition probabilities @xmath35 are evaluated by enumerating the @xmath36 possible realizations of the outcomes @xmath37 of the sites neighbouring site _",
    "i _ , and weighing them appropriately . for a 2-@xmath38 square lattice ,",
    "the possible local field values at the interfacial sites are 0 and @xmath392 .",
    "the corresponding transition probabilities for these field values are @xcite : @xmath40,\\nonumber\\\\ w_{+ } ( 0 ) = 1 - \\varepsilon_{+}p_{-}(1 - p_{+})(2 - p_{- } - 2p_{+ } + 3p_{-}p_{+}),\\nonumber\\\\ w_{- } ( 0 ) = \\varepsilon_{-}p_{+}(1 - p_{-})(2 - p_{+ } - 2p_{- } + 3p_{-}p_{+}),\\nonumber\\\\ w_{+}(-2 ) = 1 - \\varepsilon_{+}(1 - p_{+})[1 -(1-p_{-})^3],\\nonumber\\\\ w_{-}(-2 ) = \\varepsilon_{-}p_{+}(1-p_{-}^3)\\nonumber.\\\\ \\label{teqns}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in @xcite , the model was explored at coexistence with an ordered sequential update applied to memoryless agents @xcite : @xmath41 in the present paper , we go beyond this in two different ways .",
    "first , still at coexistence , we explore the effect of different updates on the @xmath42 phase diagram of the model : next , we examine the model away from coexistence , for distinct values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the basic quantities considered hereafter are the magnetization @xmath45 , staggered magnetization @xmath46 and the energy @xmath47 .",
    "these quantities are defined for a finite sample of @xmath48 agents ( or sites ) and @xmath48__z__/2 bonds ( or links ) , as + @xmath49 in the following we shall usually consider mean values @xmath50 , @xmath51e@xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we begin this section with a review of the physical significance of updating schemes .",
    "most generally , updates can be random or ordered as follows :    * _ random _ : here , sites are chosen at random for the consecutive application of rules . * _ ordered _ : here , sites are chosen in an ordered fashion , i.e. , after choosing every @xmath54 site , the @xmath55 site is selected .    since the sociological basis for this work was the propagation of innovation through connected societies @xcite , we choose to deal only with ordered updates here . however , even ordered updates have two subclasses : parallel and sequential .",
    "assume a condition _ a _ such that when an agent satisfies _ a _ , it changes strategy :    * _ sequential update _ : in this type of update , we check the condition _ a _ on the @xmath54 site , then update the efficiency of the site and proceed to the @xmath55 site using the updated value of the @xmath54 site .",
    "* _ parallel update _ : in this type of update , we check the condition a on the @xmath54 site , do _ not _ update the site but instead save the update - decision in memory , and proceed to the next site .",
    "once the whole lattice is swept , all the saved update - decisions are implemented ` simultaneously ' .",
    "the choice of different updates generally corresponds to different physical situations : it has been shown that it also leads to a disparity in the convergence time of the systems concerned @xcite .",
    "we therefore examine all possible combinations for our two update rules :    1 .",
    "parallel updates for both majority rule and performance rules ( _ pp _ ) .",
    "parallel update for majority rule and sequential update for performance rules ( _ ps _ ) .",
    "3 .   sequential updates for both majority rule and performance rules ( _ ss _ ) .",
    "sequential update for majority rule and parallel update for performance rules ( _ sp _ ) .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we explore the phase dynamics at coexistence for each of these update rules in turn , for both parameters @xmath29 and @xmath4 .",
    "we state at the outset that all the updates ( except for the _ sp _ update ) which we consider , result in models which are in the general university class of the voter model @xcite : the inverse energy 1/_e(t ) _ is thus always proportional to the logarithm of time , ln @xmath26 .",
    "when , as in the case of the @xmath56 update , the value of the slope is exactly @xmath57 @xcite , the _ exact _ universality class of the voter model is retrieved .",
    "this is the update that was used throughout @xcite ; however the phase behaviour of the model was there only explored for the parameter @xmath29 , whereas here we extend it to the parameter @xmath4 . in figure",
    "[ fig : sspd ] , we plot the inverse energy 1/@xmath58 in the @xmath42 plane at time @xmath59 for a square lattice of size @xmath60 .",
    "this phase diagram shows clearly the existence of a disordered paramagnetic phase embedded in a largely frozen phase elsewhere .",
    "the disordered phase exists for @xmath61 when @xmath62 .",
    "our results agree with those of @xcite for @xmath63 , and extend them all across the rest of the @xmath42 plane .",
    "we mention here that the average time required to reach consensus increases exponentially as _",
    "_ decreases in the frozen phase , leading to the presence of striped states @xcite at limiting values of @xmath29 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sspd ] also makes it clear that the effect of increasing memory wipes out the disordered phase : this is as it should be , since the disordered phase is generated by the competition between the majority and performance - based rules , which is dulled by increasing memory .",
    "figure  [ fig : sssnap ] shows snapshots of the dynamics of the model using a lattice of size @xmath64 at times @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath59 with random initial configurations and parameter values @xmath67 ( very close to the critical point @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 .",
    "the plots reveal characteristically voter - like @xcite coarsening behaviour .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ssv ] , we have plotted the inverse energy 1/_e(t ) _ against the natural logarithm of time ln @xmath26 for values of _ p _ around the critical point @xmath70 .",
    "each of the curves is obtained by averaging over 200 independent samples of size @xmath71 . at the critical point",
    ", we obtain a straight line with a slope close to @xmath57 @xcite , a behaviour characteristic of the exact voter model  @xcite that corresponds to @xmath72 similar behaviour is obtained at the other critical point @xmath73 , in agreement with @xcite .      in this case ,",
    "both environmental majority and performance - based rules are applied using parallel updates . as we will see , although the universality class of the model is qualitatively unchanged , this update results in the appearance of novel ordered phases compared to the _ ss _ update . as before , we first plot the phase diagram for all values of @xmath29 and @xmath4 , then show snapshots of the dynamics , and finally get a more quantitative feel for the behaviour of key quantities as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "accordingly , figure  [ fig : pppd ] ( top and bottom ) , are plots of the absolute values of magnetization @xmath74 and staggered magnetization @xmath75 , at time @xmath59 for a lattice size @xmath76 , in the @xmath29-@xmath4 plane using _ pp _ updates . in these phase diagrams , we see clear evidence of the existence of two distinct frozen phases separated by a disordered phase .",
    "looking along the line @xmath4 = 1 , disorder prevails for @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "notice the symmetry of the two critical points about @xmath80 : we shall have more to say about this later on .    for _ p _ below @xmath73",
    ", there is a frozen phase characterised by overall alignment of spins : we call this the parallel frozen phase ( pfp ) . for _ p _ above @xmath68 , the frozen phase that appears is characterised by an anti - parallel ordering of spins : we call this the anti - parallel frozen phase ( afp ) .",
    "we mention also that in the afp , the lattice may have more than one anti - parallel domain , with thin frustrated chains running in between them .",
    "this frustration can be attributed to the inability of the different domains to align with each other under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the disturbances caused by these chains ( in quantities such as @xmath74 or @xmath47 ) due to misalignment decrease as @xmath81 and also appear to vanish for large times .",
    "again , we notice that the phase transition disappears for low @xmath4 ; in fact , at very low values of @xmath4 the evolving lattice may get trapped into striped states @xcite at long times .",
    "this can be understood as follows : the effect of a long memory ( @xmath4 small ) strongly reduces the relative impact of the performance - based rule . depending on the value of @xmath4",
    ", the performance rule may not be effective for several timesteps whereas the majority rule is implemented at every timestep . in the limit of vanishing @xmath4 , then",
    ", only the ( zero - temperature ) majority rule will be effective , leading to stripe formation as predicted by  @xcite for this situation .",
    "figure  [ fig : ppmat ] comprises snapshots of the dynamics of the model for a @xmath82 square lattice of size @xmath64 and at time @xmath83 , with random initial configurations .",
    "the plots show a portion of size @xmath84 of the square lattice for three values of @xmath29 : @xmath85 ( near the critical point @xmath73 between the pfp and the paramagnetic phase ) , @xmath86 ( within the paramagnetic phase ) and @xmath87 ( near the critical point @xmath68 separating the paramagnetic phase from the afp ) , with @xmath63 .",
    "the snapshot at @xmath85 shows the lattice evolving towards consensus ( parallel alignment ) with the formation of domains of one type only .",
    "the snapshot at @xmath86 shows the lattice in its disordered phase , while the one at @xmath87 shows that the nature of the lattice ordering is anti - parallel .    to investigate this more quantitatively , we plot the absolute value of magnetization @xmath74 , the absolute value of staggered magnetization @xmath75 and energy @xmath58 against",
    ", with @xmath69 , in figure  [ fig : ppmag ] .",
    "these measurements were recorded using a square lattice of size @xmath88 at time @xmath89 .",
    "all the curves are averaged over 100 independent samples for each value of _ p_. in the region @xmath90 , the values of magnetization @xmath74 and staggered magnetization @xmath75 are both equal to unity at saturation , implying a parallel alignment of the sites ; whereas for _ p _ above @xmath68 , the magnetization @xmath74 is zero and the staggered magnetization @xmath75 equals unity at saturation , indicating an anti - parallel alignment of the sites .",
    "the energy graph is consistent with this interpretation , given the definition of the energy in equation  [ defs ] : zero in the pfp , middling in the paramagnetic phase and unity in the afp .    in order to confirm the voter - like nature of the critical points , we plot the inverse energy @xmath91 against the natural logarithm of time ln @xmath26 , choosing @xmath29 values near both critical points ( see figure  [ fig : ppv1 ] and figure  [ fig : ppv2 ] ) .",
    "each curve is an average over 200 independent samples .",
    "exactly at the critical points @xmath92 and @xmath93 , a linear behaviour of inverse energy with respect to ln @xmath26 is found , with slopes of @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively .",
    "while the critical exponents are those of the voter model @xcite , the values of the slope are different from @xmath57 : we find therefore that the _ pp _ update of the model belongs to the universality class of the generalised , rather than the exact , voter model @xcite .",
    "to conclude this subsection : the main effect of the _ pp _ update is to change the nature of the ordering in one of the two frozen phases , so that anti - parallel ordering is found in the high-@xmath29 frozen phase .",
    "as before , the effect of increasing memory ( going to low @xmath4 ) is to smear out the phase transitions to the disordered phase , by undermining the effect of the outcome - based rule whose competition with the majority rule causes the appearance of disorder .",
    "such instances of mixed domains have been found in recent work on coevolving ( parallel ) dynamics @xcite ; some features of these results also appear in studies of threshold dynamics of societal systems @xcite . for a real - life example of the afp in the case of technology diffusion , we cite the results of @xcite where the authors conclude that  in technology clusters where direct competitors are right next door , leading firms generate innovations that are technologically very distant from their neighbours \" @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the _ ps_-updated model is qualitatively similar to that of the _ pp_-updated model above .",
    "again , there are two frozen phases pfp and afp , separated by a disordered phase : the values of the critical points @xmath73 and @xmath68 are however shifted , such that the disordered region extends between @xmath96 and @xmath97 at @xmath69 .",
    "we find once again that the two critical points are symmetrically placed with respect to @xmath98 , as in the @xmath99 update : we will give an argument for why this is so , in the following subsection .    to avoid repetition ,",
    "we present only the phase diagram for the staggered magnetisation as a function of @xmath29 and @xmath4 : figure  [ fig : pspd ] shows the absolute value of the staggered magnetization @xmath75 of the system at time @xmath59 for a square lattice of size @xmath76 .",
    "the paramagnetic region , with low values of @xmath75 is coloured black in the figure , whereas the frozen regions ( containing either parallel or anti - parallel ordering ) with high values of @xmath75 , are coloured yellow ( light grey ) .",
    "these phases are investigated more quantitatively in figure  [ fig : psmag ] , where we plot the absolute value of magnetization @xmath74 , energy @xmath47 and the absolute value of staggered magnetization @xmath75 against _",

    "the region where both the magnetization @xmath74 and staggered magnetization @xmath75 curves saturate to 1 , corresponds to parallel alignment , whereas @xmath100 with @xmath101 implies an anti - parallel alignment of the spin types .",

    "the straight line corresponding to @xmath102 ( shown in red ) has a slope of approximately @xmath104 . ]",

    "again , small values of @xmath4 indicating longer memories of outcomes , lead to a smearing out of the phase transition , because of the decreasing effectiveness of the outcome - based rule .",

    "the straight line corresponding to @xmath108 ( shown in red ) has slope @xmath105 approximately . ]      in this subsection , we give arguments for the three most important features of the phase diagrams presented above :    a.   the appearance of anti - parallel ordering in both @xmath99 and @xmath109 updates b.   the symmetry of the pfp and the afp phases in both @xmath99 and @xmath109 updates c.   the positioning of the disordered phase in @xmath56 , @xmath99 and @xmath109 updates    the clue which explains all of the above , is the formation of ` active ' or disparate bonds by the rules of the model under different updates : these are clearly the units of anti - parallel ordering .",
    "consider thus configurations where a site is surrounded by a majority of its own kind : this would correspond to a local field of @xmath110 for a @xmath0 , and @xmath111 for a @xmath1 . here",
    "the majority of the bonds are ` like ' or ` inactive ' .",
    "the transition probability for the increase of active bonds from such configurations is @xmath112 ( or @xmath113 ) [ see equation  [ teqns ] ] .",
    "the transition probabilities for the _ decrease _ of active bonds are given by an opposite scenario , yielding @xmath114 ( or @xmath115 ) [ see equation  [ teqns ] ] .",
    "we plot two of these transition probabilities in figure  [ fig : tp1 ] , corresponding respectively to an increase and a decrease of active bonds : the former peaks at @xmath116 while the latter peaks at @xmath117 .    )",
    "( drawn as solid line ( in green ( grey ) ) ) and @xmath114 ( drawn as dashed line ( in black ) ) against @xmath29 [ from equation  [ teqns ] ] . ]",
    "the net probability of having active bonds is the difference between these two transition probabilities , and is plotted in figure  [ fig : tp2 ] .",
    "we see from this that the probability of having active bonds is greatest at @xmath118 , and least at @xmath119 .",
    "the last ingredient that we need to explain the afp phase in the @xmath99 and @xmath109 updates is the fact that once clusters with many active bonds , i.e. anti - parallel ordering , are formed , the majority rule applied via the _ parallel _ update _ preserves _ such ordering . with all this in place",
    "we see that as expected , the afp phase in both @xmath99 and @xmath109 updates shows up in qualitatively the same regions as predicted by figure  [ fig : tp2 ] , with a peak , in both cases at around @xmath120 .",
    "correspondingly , the pfp in both @xmath99 and @xmath109 updates shows up in the region predicted in this figure , with a peak in both cases at around @xmath121 .",
    "notice ( figure  [ fig : tp2 ] ) that the peak and the dip in the probability of active bonds are symmetric about @xmath80 , thus explaining the symmetry that we have observed in figure  [ fig : pppd ] and figure  [ fig : pspd ] ; @xmath80 is thus the natural point for the appearance of the disordered phase in both @xmath99 and @xmath109 updates , as will be confirmed by an inspection of figure  [ fig : pppd ] , figure  [ fig : pspd ] and figure  [ fig : tp2 ] .    ) and @xmath114 is plotted against @xmath29 [ see equation  [ teqns ] ] . ]",
    "the only remaining point to be explained is the appearance of the disordered phase in the @xmath56 update . in this case too , the analysis leading to figure  [ fig : tp2 ] for the probabilities of having active bonds remains valid .",
    "however , the sequential update of the majority rule always favours strictly parallel ordering , so that typically clusters of active bonds are destroyed once formed .",
    "when the probability of their formation is strongest , i.e. at @xmath116 ( see figure  [ fig : tp1 ] ) , the competition between the majority and outcome - based rules is at its most intense , and a disordered phase may be expected to appear .",
    "indeed , the mid - point of the disordered phase for the @xmath56 update is shown in figure  [ fig : sspd ] to be in exact agreement with this predicted peak , given as it is by @xmath122 .      in the case of this update , the phase diagram , figure  [ fig : sppd ] , shows nothing but a frozen phase .",
    "as is evident from the plot of inverse energy 1/@xmath58 versus ln @xmath26 ( figure  [ fig : spevt ] ) , there is a continuous increase in 1/@xmath58 for all values of @xmath29 at @xmath123 ( where the phase transition is expected to be the most visible ) .",
    "this suggests that the two rules , majority and performance - based , do not compete with each other at all ( this is what had led to the appearance of the disordered phase in all the other updates ) .",
    "we suggest that this might be because the sequential update ( with its more immediate conversions ) in the case of the majority rule completely dominates the slower parallel update for the outcome - based rule : this in turn leads to an increasing tendency for consensus , independent of the value of @xmath29 , with which our results are consistent .",
    "evidently , the real use of a competitive learning model such as this one is when the agents have a choice of distinct strategies .",
    "the full exploration of the behaviour of the model at coexistence as carried out in this paper as well as in earlier work @xcite was aimed at an understanding of its phase diagram . however , in the exploration of the behaviour of the model away from coexistence , we hope to gain an understanding of the relative importance of parameters such as superiority of strategy ( modelled by @xmath29 ) and memory ( modelled by @xmath4 ) , when these are in competition .",
    "the behaviour in asymmetric conditions ( using @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) is formulated in terms of the application of two biasing ` fields ' @xcite @xmath126 such that one strategy is favoured over the other .    in the following subsection , we look at a linear response formulation of our question in terms of unequal @xmath29 s , viewed as a biasing field , keeping @xmath4 the same for both strategies . in the final subsection , we look at unequal strategies _ as well as _ unequal memories , to find out whether inferior strategies applied with a good memory of past outcomes , can win overall .",
    "linear response theory is premised on the basis that an order parameter such as the magnetisation undergoes a sharp change in the neighbourhood of a critical point . in both the @xmath56 and @xmath99 updates of this model , there are two critical points @xmath73 and @xmath68 separating a paramagnetic phase from two frozen phases . in this subsection , we look at the linear response behaviour of the model in the vicinity of both critical points , starting from the disordered phase : clearly the response will depend both on the value of @xmath29 as well as on the value of the biasing field @xmath127 ( defined in terms of the difference of the @xmath29 s in equation  [ hbdef ] ) . in the following ,",

    "figure  [ fig : ppmvh ] is a plot showing the variation in magnetization @xmath45 along the field @xmath127 for different @xmath29 values at @xmath69 . for the lower values of @xmath29 , in the vicinity of @xmath73",

    "the principal competition in this model is that between two strategies with different global success rates @xmath29 , which determines the relative dominance of each one in phase space .",
    "the memory parameter @xmath4 plays a more subtle role in this competition : although it can not be a determinant of phase behaviour in the way that the success rates are ( as a consequence of the rules elucidated in equation  [ teqns ] ) , it _ can _ , as we will show , cause a surprising change in the dominance of an ostensibly superior strategy . in @xcite",
    ", it had been suggested that agents with inferior strategies and good memories might indeed win against agents who had better strategies but worse memories .",

    "green ( grey ) denotes the dominance of the @xmath0 s , while blue ( black ) denotes that of the @xmath1 s .",
    "the other colours represent cases of intermediate ordering . ]",
    "* the leftmost face of the cube corresponds to the plane @xmath156 ; this implies that the agents using @xmath0 strategies will never convert , no matter what the outcome - based rule says .",
    "the minimum occupancy of @xmath0 strategies for random configurations should thus be of the order of @xmath157 , which can only increase depending on the conversions of agents using @xmath1 strategies into the camp of the @xmath0 s .",
    "the bottom line corresponds to @xmath158 , which is when such conversions are maximal ( so that all @xmath48 sites are @xmath0 ) : the green ( grey ) colour is at its most pronounced here , changing gradually over to other colours only as @xmath159 to the right of the line , when agents using @xmath1 strategies too begin to refuse to convert , irrespective of the outcome rules . as the values of @xmath138 increase beyond 0.5 ( the fixed value for @xmath160 , we note that the dominance of the @xmath0 strategy gradually gives way to states with a mixture of strategies ; when @xmath159 , this tendency is at its most pronounced , while when @xmath161 , this is at its least pronounced , since local conversions can sometimes go against global success rates .",
    "* the front face of the cube corresponds to @xmath162 ; this implies that agents using @xmath1 strategies will never convert , no matter what the outcome - based rule says .",
    "this is a reflection of the previous case , where the minimum number of @xmath1 sites is once again @xmath157 , which can only be increased as the conversions from the @xmath0 s add to it . *",
    "the top face of the cube corresponds to @xmath163 , where globally a predominance of the @xmath1 strategy is expected .",
    "this is found over almost all the range of @xmath151 except at low values of @xmath149 , where agents using the @xmath0 strategy refuse to convert , despite their globally poorer performance .     a @xmath148 plot of magnetization @xmath45 for the parameters @xmath149 ( lying between @xmath164 and @xmath165 ) , @xmath151 and @xmath138 , with @xmath166 , for a lattice of size @xmath60 at time @xmath155 .",
    "the red ( lower black ) region represents the dominance of the @xmath0 strategy and the blue ( upper black ) region represents the dominance of the @xmath1 strategy .",
    "the green ( grey ) region represents afp .",
    "]    the interior of the cube can show markedly different behaviour , which we illustrate via a sample slice shown in figure  [ fig : pp3d2 ] . in this figure ,",
    "red ( lower black ) and blue ( upper black ) regions correspond to the dominance of @xmath0 and @xmath1 strategies respectively . here",
    "we set the value of @xmath137 to 0.7 , and look at a slice of its phase space cube , as before : choosing @xmath149 to be between 0.7 and 0.8 , we look at the dominating strategy as a function of the variables @xmath151 and @xmath138 . if the memory parameters had not existed , we would have expected the @xmath1 strategy ( blue ( upper black ) region in the figure ) to predominate only for @xmath167 ; the red ( lower black ) region would have been covering the entire slice below this , corresponding to the dominance of the @xmath0 strategy .",
    "however , the reality is rather different . the @xmath0 strategy does indeed predominate for @xmath168 , provided that agents using the @xmath1 strategy have imperfect memory ; but there is a striking predominance of the @xmath1 strategy ( even for very low values of @xmath138 ) provided that the memory of the agents employing this strategy , is much better than those of the other kind ( @xmath169 ) .     a @xmath148 plot of absolute staggered magnetization @xmath75 with parameters @xmath149(along @xmath150 ) , @xmath151(along @xmath152 ) and @xmath138(along @xmath153 ) for @xmath154 and lattice size @xmath60 , at time @xmath155 .",
    "the graph delineates the region of afp for these parameter values . ]",
    "a last feature to mention is the green ( grey ) region in figure  [ fig : pp3d2 ] : here , there is a region of alternating @xmath0 and @xmath1 ordering ( afp ) , corresponding to ongoing competition between the two strategies .",
    "this phenomenon is most pronounced when the two strategies are equally successful , and are _ both _ accompanied by weak memories of earlier outcomes . in figure  [ fig : pp3d3 ] , the structure of the full afp is shown ( by selecting phase points with low values of absolute magnetisation @xmath74 and high absolute staggered magnetization @xmath75 ) as a function of @xmath138 and @xmath28 , fixing @xmath170 .",
    "the work of this paper extends work done on a problem of strategic learning @xcite which , although originally suggested by a problem on technology diffusion @xcite , has much wider ramifications ( e.g. , in relation to threshold learning dynamics @xcite ) .    in any agent - based modelling scheme , it is important to know whether agents react sequentially or collectively to the spread of information .",
    "our results show that these issues make a quantitative as well as a qualitative difference to the results , changing not just exponents but also the entire nature of the phase diagram in most cases .",
    "given that , typically , the propagation of technologies through well - connected societies is of interest  @xcite , we choose ordered rather than random updates , and examine the response of the model of  @xcite to all possible combinations of sequential and parallel updating . from the viewpoint of theoretical physics , a major result is that this model is robustly in the universality class of the voter model  @xcite , for all but one of the updates .",
    "this strong relationship with the voter model results from the model of  @xcite being driven by interfacial noise alone , i.e. the absence of surface tension  @xcite .",
    "another major result , still to do with updates , is the appearance of a phase of anti - parallel ordering ( afp ) in the high - performing limits of @xmath29 , for both the @xmath99 and the @xmath109 updates .",
    "while the technicalities behind this are explained in the text , we give here a more intuitive reason for this , from the perspective of strategic learning .",
    "the parallel scheme can be viewed as a more ` equilibrated ' update than the sequential one , since it gives a chance for the entire lattice to be updated ` simultaneously ' .",
    "it is then natural that in the regime that both agents are high - performing , they should be equally preferred : this lies behind the ` alternating ' order inherent in the afp regime .",
    "by contrast , since the sequential paradigm corresponds to a ` non - equilibrium ' update , where every agent responds to the updated value of its neighbours , the above logic leads to a disordered phase where every prescription of the outcome - based rule is countermanded by the following majority rule .",
    "using once again the illustration of propagating technologies @xcite : when all the populace have equal and _ simultaneous _ access to information about two high - performing technologies , we will see the coexistence of both @xcite ( as predicted by the afp phase ) , whereas when information about each one is passed on _ sequentially _ , the conflicting information so obtained can result in sheer disorder .",
    "finally , we mention here that our investigation of different updates on this game - theoretic model has been applied to related game - theoretic models of cognitive learning and synaptic plasticity @xcite , where updates relate to the directionality of synapses in a network .    moving away from the domain of critical behaviour at coexistence",
    ", we have looked at the behaviour of the competitive learning model when the two strategies have distinct attributes ( this , after all , is truer to the title of competitive learning ! ) . to begin with ,",
    "we have examined the response of the model to unequal strategies @xmath43 , and have found in general that the smarter strategy wins ( for equal values of the memory parameter @xmath4 ) , as might be expected .",
    "an interesting feature is that the region of anti - parallel ordering ( afp ) found earlier still persists in the presence of bias , provided that the difference in @xmath29 is below a well - defined bound : in other words , when two distinct strategies are _ almost _ equally successful , one will typically find that they can coexist in society .",
    "finally , we have looked at the effect of memory : we have found that while memory has a secondary role in determining the phase behaviour of the model , it has a particularly striking effect in turning around the results of any bias in @xmath29 .",
    "a major result of our paper is thus that decisions based on a good memory of earlier outcomes can , within limits , compensate for the choice of inferior strategies .",
