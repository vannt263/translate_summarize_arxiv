    "a subfield of computer vision and pattern recognition , image saliency detection is an interesting and challenging problem which touches upon the knowledge from multiple subjects like mathematics , biology , neurology , computer science and so on .",
    "many previous works have demonstrated that saliency detection is significant in many fields including image segmentation @xcite , objection detection and recognition @xcite , image quality assessment @xcite , image editing and manipulating @xcite , visual tracking @xcite , etc .",
    "the models of saliency detection can be roughly categorized into bottom - up and top - down approaches @xcite,@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on bottom - up saliency models . in recent years",
    ", color contrast cue @xcite,@xcite and color spatial distribution cue @xcite are widely used in saliency detection .",
    "it is considered that salient objects always show large contrast over their surroundings and are generally more compact in the image domain .",
    "saliency algorithms based on these two cues usually work well when the salient object can be distinctive in terms of contrast and diversity , but they usually fail in processing images containing complicated background which involves various patterns . on the other hand ,",
    "pattern distinctness is described in @xcite by studying the inner statistics ( actually corresponds to the distribution for the feature ) of the patches in pca space .",
    "this method achieves favorable results but there still exists some background patterns which are misjudged to be salient .",
    "in addition , by assuming most of the narrow border of the image be the background region , backgroundness prior plays an important role in calculating the saliency maps in many approaches @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , if the patches on the border are treated as background patches directly , these algorithms often perform inadequately when the potential salient objects touch the image border .    based on the above analysis",
    ", we propose a saliency detection method considering the following aspects which also go to our contributions : 1 ) we combine the backgroundness prior into constructing the spaces of background - based distribution implicitly ( not directly ) to investigate the background , where we will find euclidean and @xmath0 metrics may not be suitable in exploring the distribution ( inner statistics ) for the patches and we should quote some other metric to describe the patch difference appropriately .",
    "2 ) in the step of refinement , we also design a new up - sampling scheme based on geodesic distance .",
    "here we describe the proposed approach in three main steps .",
    "firstly , the patches from image border are used to generate a group of spaces of background - based distribution ( sbd ) to compute the coarse saliency map . secondly ,",
    "in the bayesian perspective , the coarse saliency map is enhanced .",
    "then the final saliency map is obtained by using a novel up - sampling method based on geodesic distance . and the main framework is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "the work @xcite suggests that a pixel be salient if the patch containing this pixel has less contribution to the distribution of the whole image treated in pca system .",
    "however , problem may occur when the area of the salient object is overwhelming in size . in this case , if all the image patches are utilized to do pca , the patches in the salient object may have high contribution to distribution of the whole image patches , then naturally the difference between the salient patches and the whole image will not be discriminative . in order to increase this difference and make the salient object be much discriminative from the background , in this paper we aim to re - establish the background distribution in some new spaces , called spaces of background - based distribution ( sbd ) . for this purpose",
    ", we have the following considerations :    * 1 ) feature representation * for the patches , color information is used to represent their features .",
    "particularly , two color spaces are used here , including cie - lab and i - rg - by .",
    "cie - lab is most widely used in previous works , while i - rg - by that is transformed from rgb color space is also proved to be effective in saliency detection algorithm @xcite , where @xmath1 denotes the intensity channel , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are two color channels .",
    "thus , if we take a @xmath4 patch as an example , the feature of this patch will be represented by a @xmath5 column vector @xmath6 . and here we denote this vectorized feature for image patch @xmath7 to be @xmath8 .    *",
    "2 ) background patches selection * we define the pseudo - background region as the border region of the image like the work in @xcite . to improve the performance , some approaches @xcite,@xcite divide the patches on image border into four groups including top , bottom , left and right , and deal with them respectively . in our method , we do not simply consider some certain border in a single direction , but consider the correlations between every two neighboring connective borders .",
    "this is considered to be more reasonable since the neighboring connective borders tend to present similar background information . as a result",
    ", we get four groups of patches that are located around the image border .",
    "particularly , these groups are denoted as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the sets of vectorized patches on the top , bottom , left and right borders of the image respectively .    to clearly present the proposed idea in the view of metric space",
    ", we choose to start with eigendecomposition .",
    "particularly , with eigendecomposition we have @xmath12 and @xmath13 to denote the matrices of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrices @xmath14 for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , respectively . with @xmath12 , for each patch @xmath7 , we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 will be the * element * ( new coordinates ) of patch @xmath7 in the @xmath19-th sba .    then",
    ", we turn to introduce some appropriate * metric * for these elements .",
    "considering the fact that the construction of these elements is carried out on the suspicious background patches , it is speculated that a patch which is similar to the background should be highly probable in the distribution while a patch belongs to the salient region should be highly probable away from the distribution .",
    "so , the metric needs to be carefully designed .",
    "@xmath0 metric is utilized in @xcite to calculate the patch distinctness in its pca coordinate systems and is proved to be more effective than euclidean metric .",
    "however , it may become invalid in our spaces if one ignores the distribution of the data . in this case , mahalanobis distance @xcite , @xcite is used here instead exactly for the elements obtained above , and its effectiveness is explained in detail in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] . therefore , for each patch",
    "@xmath7 we compute a distance @xmath20 as its _ mahalanobis distance _ via @xmath21 where @xmath13 is the matrix of eigenvalues and @xmath22 is in the transformed space projected from the average patch @xmath23 for @xmath15 .",
    "it is reasonable to understand that @xmath13 used here is to denote the influence of different scales in different components of the eigenvectors from @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] ) and it is better to describe the distribution of the patches with this metric . in fact , though the distance can be directly computed by @xmath25 , the two ways of definition of mahalanobis distance are equivalent , and it is more convenient to elaborate the proposed idea by the above context of eigendecomposition .    to suppress the value of @xmath26 from the background as much as possible",
    "while retaining the one in the salient regions , we set a threshold h to update @xmath27 , i.e. , if @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is set to be the average value of @xmath26 computed by eq.([3 ] ) .",
    "the reason we do this thresholding is originated from the fact that more than 95 percent of images have larger background area than the salient area when investigating a widely used datasets msra5000 @xcite .    .",
    "so for each group @xmath15 , after repeating the calculations from eq.([1 ] ) to eq.([3 ] ) , we get four _ adjusted mahalanobis distance maps _ that labeled as @xmath31 .",
    "each map is normalized to [ 0,1 ] .",
    "next , we create the _ single - scale coarse saliency map _ @xmath32 by taking a weighted average of the above four maps as @xmath33 where ` @xmath34 ' denotes the element - wise multiplication from here on in , and @xmath35 . unlike the use of entropy in @xcite ,",
    "we employ it to measure the value of @xmath36 .",
    "firstly , the entropy values of @xmath31 are calculated to be @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "then the average entropy value @xmath38 is computed and compared with each @xmath39 , that is , if @xmath40 , @xmath41 ; otherwise , @xmath42 .",
    "it means that , for the four maps @xmath31 , the more chaotic the map is , the less its contribution to @xmath32 will be . in this way , even if some parts of the potential salient object touch part of some border , they will not contribute significantly to the background distribution since only a few @xmath43 are influenced , and the sbd in all the @xmath9 may still explore the common features of the true background .    in practice",
    ", we calculate @xmath32 on three scales of input , such as 100% , 50% , 25% of the original size of the observed image like the works @xcite,@xcite , and average them to form the multi - scale _ coarse saliency map _ @xmath44 .    )",

    "however , unlike these two works where either a convex hull or refined convex hull is used to locate the extracted foreground in determining the * likelihood * , we extract the foreground region by directly thresholding the _ coarse saliency map _ @xmath44 with its mean value .",
    "then , the likelihood of each pixel @xmath7 is defined by @xcite @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the observable vector feature of pixel @xmath7 from three color channels , i.e. , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in cie - lab color space ; @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) denotes the extracted foreground ( or background ) ; @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) denotes the total pixel numbers in @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) ; for channel @xmath48 , @xmath55 ( or @xmath56 ) is the bin in pixel - wise color histogram within @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) which contains the value @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 ) is the number of pixels in the bin @xmath55 ( or @xmath56 ) ; and it is the same case for channels @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , we treat the _",
    "coarse saliency map _",
    "@xmath44 from section a as the * prior probability * map , and calculate the * posterior probability * map for pixel @xmath7 by @xmath60    as shown in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] ( c ) , @xmath44 are strongly enhanced .",
    "besides , we compare the @xmath61 generated by eq.([9 ] ) with other posterior probability maps in @xcite,@xcite , and present the results in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] to show that the proposed way performs better to both suppress the background noises and highlight the salient regions .",

    "for example in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] ( b ) , either some of the pixels from background or from the salient object are wrongly judged . for refinement , like @xcite , we adopt an up - sampling method where we suppose that one pixel s saliency value is determined by a weighted linear combination of the saliency of its surrounding parts . however , unlike @xcite which suggests that the weights be influenced by the color and the position information of the surround pixels , we consider that these weights should be sensitive to a _",
    "geodesic distance_. the * input image * is firstly segmented into a number of superpixels based on linear spectral clustering ( lsc ) method @xcite,@xcite and the posterior probability of each superpixel is calculated by averaging the posterior probability values @xmath61 of all its pixels inside .",
    "then for @xmath62th superpixel , if its posterior probability is labeled as @xmath63 , thus the saliency value of the @xmath19-th superpixel is measured by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total number of superpixels , and @xmath66 will be a weight based on the _ _ geodesic distance__@xcite ( to be quoted ) between superpixel @xmath19 and @xmath62 . similar to @xcite , we firstly construct an undirected weighted graph by connecting all adjacent superpixels @xmath67 and assigning their weight @xmath68 as the euclidean distance between their average colors in the cie - lab color space .",
    "then the _ geodesic distance _ between any two superpixels @xmath69 is defined as the accumulated edge weights along their shortest path on the graph via @xmath70    next we define the weight @xmath66 between two superpixels @xmath71 as @xmath72 .",
    "we can see that , when @xmath19 and @xmath62 are in a flat region , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , ensuring that saliency of @xmath62 has high contribution to the saliency of @xmath19 ; when @xmath19 and @xmath62 are in different regions , there exists at least one strong edge ( @xmath75 ) on their shortest path and @xmath76 , ensuring that the saliency of @xmath62 should not contribute to the saliency of @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath77 is the deviation for all @xmath78 and computed in practice .",
    "[ fig.4 ] ( c ) and ( d ) show the comparisons based on our refinement methods and the up - sampling proposed in @xcite and our method performs better .",
    "we evaluate and compare with other methods the performance of the proposed algorithm on two widely used datasets : msra5000 @xcite and pascal1500 @xcite .",
    "the msra5000 contains 5000 images with pixel - level ground - truths , while the pascal1500 which contains 1500 images with pixel - level ground - truths is more challenging for testing because they have more complicated patterns in both foreground and background .",
    "then , we compare our results with eight state - of - the art methods , including hc @xcite , rc @xcite , sf @xcite , pca @xcite , fpisa @xcite , hs @xcite , mss @xcite , rbd @xcite , among which are discussed and evaluated in the benchmark paper @xcite .    in the study",
    ", we use 4 standard criteria for quantitative evaluation , i.e. , precision - recall ( pr ) curve @xcite , f - measure @xcite , mean absolute error ( mae ) @xcite,@xcite and auc score @xcite,@xcite . for the pr curve , it is given in fig .",

    "specially , similar to @xcite , @xcite , in table [ tab : results ] we show the precision , recall and f - measure values for adaptive threshold ( at ) , which is defined as twice the mean saliency of the image .",
    "it still shows that the proposed method achieves the best on these data .",
    "in addition , mae is used to evaluate the averaged degree of the dissimilarity and comparability between the saliency image and the ground - truth at every pixel , and auc score is calculated based on the true positive and false positive rates .",
