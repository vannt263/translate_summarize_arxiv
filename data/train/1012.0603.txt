    "many fields of contemporary astrophysics require a highly - precise determination of basic stellar parameters .",
    "a prime example is the investigation of stellar structure and evolution , where asteroseismology has opened up a window to study the governing physical processes in detail ( e.g.  aerts et al .",
    "other examples are observational constraints on planet - formation theories by analyses of planet host stars ( e.g.  neves et al .",
    "predictions of super-/hyper  nova models may be tested via analyses of secondary stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( e.g.  gonzlez hernndez et al .",
    "@xcite ) and ( hyper-)runaway stars ( przybilla et al .",
    "tight constraints on galactochemical evolution theories may be derived using stars as tracers of the variation of chemical composition with time and location in the galactic disk ( e.g.  fuhrmann  @xcite ; przybilla  @xcite ) .",
    "precise stellar parameter determinations are decisive in describing the stellar atmospheric structure correctly , i.e.  the temperature gradient and density stratification .",
    "this is crucial for the regions where the continuum and spectral lines of interest are formed .",
    "a fundamental problem is that a direct determination of stellar parameters is usually not possible .",
    "quantitative spectral analysis has to rely on the comparison of synthetic spectra with observation , which in turn guides computations of improved models . in principle",
    ", this requires an iterative approach . in practice , however , approximate methods for the parameter determination are favoured on most occasions to shorten the process , by e.g.  use of photometric indicators or comparison with prescribed ( and thus necessarily limited ) grids of models . unfortunately",
    ", the gain in efficiency is often accompanied by a loss in accuracy .",
    "quantitative spectroscopy is highly prone to systematic errors .",
    "the analysis methodology , the quality of the observed spectra and the details of the assumptions made in the modelling , when taken together , determine the accuracy of a work . in particular , relaxing the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) for the spectrum synthesis is crucial for improving the accuracy of stellar analyses .    in what follows",
    "we describe the basic requirements for a highly accurate determination of stellar atmospheric parameters by utilising all available lines of hydrogen and helium , plus multiple metal ionization equilibria , in non - lte .",
    "we concentrate on ob - type stars near the main sequence and on their evolved progeny , ba - type supergiants .",
    "the stellar mass range between @xmath18 and 25m@xmath2 is covered for effective temperatures from @xmath18000 to 35000k .",
    "the models and analysis technique have been developed and thoroughly tested during the past years ( przybilla et al .",
    "@xcite , pbbk06 henceforth ; nieva & przybilla  @xcite , np07/np08 ; przybilla , nieva & butler  @xcite , pnb08 ) .",
    "one should keep in mind that the same philosophy can , in principle , be applied to any type of star once the underlying stellar atmospheric physics is reproduced consistently .",
    "we start with an overview of requirements on atmospheric models , the spectrum synthesis and the quality of observed spectra for a reliable quantitative analysis ( sects .",
    "[ modelrequirements ] & [ observations ] ) .",
    "then , a self - consistent spectrum analysis technique is described ( sect .",
    "[ analysis ] ) .",
    "concrete examples of stellar parameter determinations via non - lte spectral analyses are discussed ( sect .",
    "[ examples ] ) .",
    "finally , common sources of systematic error are briefly addressed ( sect .",
    "[ errors ] ) .",
    "an implicit requirement for high - precision quantitative spectrum analysis is the availability of model atmosphere and line - formation codes that account for all physics relevant to the objects of interest .",
    "all assumptions / approximations made to simplify the modelling need to be tested thoroughly to avoid fundamental sources of systematic effects in the analysis .",
    "familiarity with the codes and the physics behind them are essential for successful work .    on the microscopic scale ,",
    "the thermodynamic state of the plasma in a stellar atmosphere is determined by two competitive processes .",
    "collisions act to establish detailed equilibrium _ locally _ , while radiative processes are _ non - local _ in character , thus driving the plasma out of detailed equilibrium .",
    "local thermodynamic equilibrium is established only when either collisions dominate or the radiation field is isotropic and planckian .",
    "such conditions prevail to a good approximation deep in stellar atmospheres , but the strict validity of lte can not be assumed for the observable layers . instead , statistical equilibrium is established .",
    "the non - linear interdependency of radiation field and level populations is the essence of the non - lte problem that in principle needs to be solved .",
    "nevertheless , stellar atmospheres are described well by the condition of lte for many practical applications .",
    "in such a case non - lte line formation assuming a lte model atmosphere is sufficient to produce the synthetic spectra required for the comparison with observation .",
    "the calculation of reliable occupation numbers for the energy levels involved in the transitions to be investigated is a prerequisite for an accurate analysis of spectra .",
    "good agreement between model spectra and observation can be achieved when the following conditions are simultaneously fulfilled in the non - lte computations : 1 )  the local temperatures and particle densities , i.e.  the atmospheric structure , are accurately known , 2 )  the radiation field is realistic , 3 ) all relevant radiative and collisional processes are taken into account , and 4 )  high - quality atomic data are available .    items 1 ) and 2 ) require a realistic physical model of the stellar atmosphere and thus an _ accurate atmospheric parameter determination_. this will be the central topic here . items 3 ) and 4 ) are related to the model atoms for the non - lte calculations , hence a careful construction of comprehensive and robust model atoms is also required ( see przybilla , this volume ) .",
    "shortcomings in any of the four conditions result in increased uncertainties of the analysis .      here",
    "we briefly recall the models and codes that provide the basis for the examples discussed in sect .",
    "[ examples ] .",
    "we use a hybrid approach for the non - lte line - formation computations .",
    "these are based on line - blanketed plane - parallel , homogeneous and hydrostatic lte model atmospheres calculated with atlas9 ( kurucz  @xcite ) .",
    "line blanketing is realised via consideration of opacity distribution functions ( odfs , kurucz  @xcite ) , where the too high iron abundance originally used by kurucz is compensated by odfs with an appropriately reduced metallicity .",
    "this allows to approach modern values for the solar abundance ( e.g.  asplund et al .",
    "@xcite ) , as iron contributes @xmath150% of the line opacity . alternatively ,",
    "atlas12 ( kurucz  @xcite ) is used for models with abundance peculiarities , allowing for opacity sampling .",
    "the model atmospheres are held fixed in the following non - lte calculations .",
    "non - lte level populations and synthetic spectra are computed with recent versions of detail and surface ( giddings  @xcite ; butler & giddings  @xcite ; both updated by k. butler ) .",
    "detail solves the coupled radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium equations employing the accelerated lambda iteration scheme of rybicki & hummer  ( @xcite ) .",
    "this allows even complex ions to be treated in a realistic way .",
    "synthetic spectra based on the resulting non - lte populations are computed with surface , using refined line - broadening data .",
    "detailed tests have shown that this hybrid non - lte approach is consistent with full non - lte calculations , but faster , for our cases of interest , ba - type supergiants ( pbbk06 ) and ob - type dwarfs and giants ( np07 ) .",
    "it also allows comprehensive model atoms to be employed .",
    "this can provide crucial improvements over full non - lte calculations , which are necessarily based on simplified model atoms .",
    "an overview of model atoms adopted for our purposes is given in pbbk06 and pnb08 .",
    "the advent of high - resolution spectrographs with large wavelength coverage , large telescopes and automated data reduction pipelines facilitates relatively easy access to high - quality spectra .",
    "however , some issues remain that introduce systematic errors into the quantitative analysis .",
    "continuum normalisation is one of the important issues , typically not achieved in a satisfactory way for echelle spectra with available data reduction pipelines alone .",
    "cross - checks with lower - resolution long - slit spectra are recommended .",
    "a customised data reduction for order merging and rectification ( see e.g.  hensberge  @xcite ) becomes often necessary when broad spectral features , like the hydrogen balmer lines , are to be analysed .",
    "uncertainties in the normalisation can lead to erroneous parameters from balmer line analysis , such as for effective temperature for the later - type stars or surface gravity for early - type stars .",
    "the modelling and analysis techniques should be tested on slowly - rotating stars of similar spectral type as the objects of interest .",
    "high - resolution and high - s / n spectra of such ` standard stars ' are required to identify line blends .",
    "these may go unnoticed at lower spectral resolution or at higher rotational velocities , affecting analyses with incomplete linelists .",
    "spectra of rapidly rotating stars are challenging , since rotational smearing can merge closely - spaced lines into a ` pseudo - continuum ' below the true continuum .",
    "line strengths may therefore be systematically underestimated .",
    "full spectrum synthesis can facilitate an analysis , if continuum windows are found . the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio can become one of the main sources of systematics , making continuum - definition difficult and weak lines inaccessible .",
    "severe limitations to the quality of line fits may be imposed  by  low  s / n .",
    "some contribution of the observational material to the total uncertainty budget for stellar parameters and elemental abundances can be expected .",
    "however , well - selected targets and careful data acquisition and reduction can help to avoid unnecessary systematics ( see sect .",
    "[ errors ] for more examples ) .",
    "here we discuss our recommended spectrum analysis technique .",
    "well - known concepts are assembled into a procedure that allows multiple stellar parameter indicators to be brought into agreement simultaneously . in combination with a determination of element abundances this facilitates the observation to be reproduced with a high degree of realism .",
    "the method works best when all lines of the balmer series , the helium lines and many transitions of the metals are utilised .",
    "spectral coverage at near - ir wavelengths is an asset .",
    "the method is organised as an iterative procedure , as sketched in fig .",

    "sco ( b0.2v ) . every line fit adopts a slightly different abundance value , resulting in a 1@xmath0 statistical uncertainty of 0.12dex from the line - to - line scatter .",
    "the cii / iii / iv ionization equilibrium is reproduced within these constraints . from np08 . ]",
    "good initial estimates for effective temperature , @xmath4 , surface gravity , @xmath5 , he abundance , @xmath6 , microturbulent velocity , @xmath7 , and metallicity , [ m / h ] ( elemental abundances , @xmath8(x ) ) are crucial to avoid many iteration cycles .",
    "standard methods like photometric calibrations ( see e.g.  smalley  @xcite ) plus estimates for the remaining quantities can be employed to gain initial approximations to start individualised calculations . also , `",
    "secondary ' parameters like @xmath7 or @xmath6 have to be treated consistently in all steps of the computations to avoid the introduction of systematic errors .",
    "the comparison of the resulting synthetic spectrum with the observed spectrum gives indications as to how the input parameters should be changed to improve the next iteration .",
    "alternatively , and more efficiently , pre - computed model grids may be utilised to perform line fits with a least - square algorithm ( e.g.  fitprof , napiwotzki  @xcite ) .",
    "parameter estimates are obtained from a @xmath9-minimisation .",
    "the first aim is to reproduce the observed hydrogen and helium spectra ( see e.g.  fig .",
    "[ hheob ] ) , the two elements constituting the bulk of the stellar material .",
    "usually , reasonable values for @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 may be obtained for early - type stars .",
    "an advantage for the practical work is that the stark - broadened hydrogen and helium lines are not highly sensitive to microturbulence and metallicity , except close to the eddington limit ( see sect .",
    "[ errors ] ) .    , while lines of the other two ions are less - sensitive to the choice of @xmath7 because of their weakness .",
    "different @xmath4 is derived from siii / iii and siiii / iv for ill - chosen @xmath7 , e.g. an overestimation of @xmath7 by 7kms@xmath10 gives @xmath11@xmath122000k .",
    "the siii / iii / iv ionization equilibrium is established only for the correct @xmath7 . from nieva  ( 2007 ) . ]    when a good fit to the h and he lines is achieved ",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 should be accurate to better than about 5% and 0.10.2dex , respectively  the procedure commences to consider metal lines .",
    "ionization equilibria , i.e.  the requirement that lines from different ions of an element have to indicate the same elemental abundance , facilitate a fine - tuning of the previously derived parameters .",
    "elements that show lines of three ionization stages in the spectrum are most valuable as they provide simultaneous constraints on both @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "examples are cii / iii / iv ( figs .",
    "[ cob ] and [ abund ] ) or siii / iii / iv in early b - type stars ( fig .  [ si - ie ] ) .",
    "typically , however , lines from only two ionization stages of an element are present in the spectrum , allowing only to constrain combinations of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "another indicator is then required for the parameter determination , e.g.  the previously analysed h / he lines , or a second ionization equilibrium .",
    "we recommend the use of multiple ionization equilibria for the parameter determination as the redundancy of information helps to minimise  systematics .",
    "iron ionization equilibria are in particular useful as they put good constraints also on metallicity , [ m / h]@xmath13[fe / h ] .",
    "simultaneously , the microturbulent velocity needs to be constrained to values more accurate than the initial estimates at this stage .",
    "this is done by plotting abundances from the line analysis versus equivalent width @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "[ abund ] for final results ) .",
    "a slope in the results indicates that the microturbulent velocity has to be adjusted .",
    "but there is much more to gain from such a plot : an offset of abundances from two ions indicates that the @xmath4/@xmath5 combination requires some fine - tuning .",
    "an excessive scatter in abundances points to remaining inconsistencies , e.g.  with basic model assumptions ( lte in fig .",
    "[ abund ] ) or with the model atom .",
    "the importance of a simultaneous determination of microturbulent velocity with other parameters  which is facilitated only iteratively  is shown in fig .  [ si - ie ] .",
    "this visualises the dependency of the resulting @xmath4 to the adopted value of @xmath7 when only one ionization equilibrium of silicon is considered , i.e.  siii / iii or siiii / iv .",
    "different values are indicated for an ill - chosen microturbulent velocity .",
    "the problem can be solved via use of multiple ionization equilibria , e.g.  by bringing siii / iii / iv simultaneously into agreement , and by considering also other elements as explained above .",
    "the goal is to derive the same value of @xmath4 , @xmath15 and @xmath7 from all hydrogen , helium and the metal lines ( @xmath6 may need to be adjusted only slightly at this stage ) .",
    "abundance analyses for elements not considered so far finalise the metallicity derivation .",
    "usually , this brings no surprises for the stellar parameter determination .",
    "exceptions can be chemically - peculiar stars , where our procedure is also useful ( przybilla et al .",
    "@xcite ) but more iteration steps can be required .",
    "the final set of parameters has high precision and high accuracy .",
    "absolute values of @xmath4 and @xmath15 show residual uncertainties as low as @xmath11% and 0.050.10dex , respectively , and for absolute elemental abundances an rms scatter of @xmath11020% .",
    "remaining major sources of systematic error can essentially be excluded after bringing so many observational constraints into agreement .",
    "a self - consistent treatment of ` secondary ' parameters such as @xmath6 , [ m / h ] and @xmath7 throughout the entire process , from the atmospheric structure to the line - profile calculation is decisive for achieving this .",
    "non - lte ionization equilibria are sensitive to even small details of the calculations , so turning this sensitivity into a high - precision tool requires avoidance of any inconsistencies .",
    "we will resume the discussion on systematics in sect .",
    "[ errors ] .",
    "a limitation for the practical work is imposed by the iterative approach , the method is time - consuming .",
    "it is not feasible at the present time to analyse large samples of spectra efficiently .",
    "there are several ideas as to how to speed up the process , e.g.  by analysis of a restricted but well - selected sample of spectral lines , which has to cover a variety of weak to strong lines of multiplets from the different spin systems of an ion .",
    "the full line sample is then analysed only in the final step .",
    "extensive use of grids of non - lte model spectra for metals with automatised line - fitting algorithms will play a crucial rle in speeding - up the method , but require considerable computational resources to sample the multi - dimensional parameter space ( @xmath4 , @xmath15 , @xmath7 , @xmath6 , [ m / h ] and abundances ) properly .",
    "nevertheless , we are confident that the analysis methodology will be applicable to high - precision studies of larger samples of stars in the near future .",
    "o and b - type main - sequence and giant stars , and their evolved progeny , the b and a - type supergiants , constitute the objects with the simplest photospheric physics among the massive stars .",
    "they are unaffected by strong stellar winds like the hotter and more luminous stars or by convection and chromospheres like the cool stars . in order to use their full potential as tracers of stellar and galactochemical evolution ( przybilla  @xcite ) improvements in the quantitative analysis had to be implemented with respect to previous work .",
    "comprehensive and robust model atoms for non - lte line - formation calculations were constructed . in parallel , the self - consistent analysis technique described in sect .",
    "[ analysis ] was implemented . here",
    "we discuss some practical aspects from the use of the recommended analysis technique , giving special emphasis on the impact of non - lte effects on both the analysis procedure and the results .",
