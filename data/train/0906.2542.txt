    "otherwise , the study of a chaotic mapping is performed along various phenomenological and/or probabilistic approaches . in this dominant approach of dynamical systems",
    "the focus is on the system seen as a transformation of _ real _ variables , the analysis being dominated besides computer experiments , by functional analysis and differential geometry .",
    "the study consists of orbits generated on computers , phase portraits , bifurcations analysis and computation of lyapunov exponents . had the system an attracting set which is not a manifold ,",
    "the fractal dimension is introduced . this phenomenological and/or _ probabilistic viewpoint",
    "_ corresponds to the mainstream approach of dynamical systems .",
    "most of the examples studied in the literature correspond to iteration of polynomial or rational mappings .",
    "another drastically different approach can be introduced and corresponds to an _ algebraic and topological approach _ of dynamical system .",
    "the mapping is seen as a dynamical system of _ complex variables _ ( complex projective space ) and studied in the framework  @xcite of a cohomology of curves in complex projective spaces . in this _ topological _ viewpoint , one counts integers ( fixed points , degrees ) , one deals with singularities and with _ blow up of points _ and _ blow down of curves _  @xcite .",
    "the matching of these two drastically different descriptions of discrete dynamical systems is far from being a simple question .",
    "consider a two - dimensional _ reversible _ mapping @xmath0 : @xmath1 the components @xmath2 , @xmath3 may be polynomials , or they may be rational .",
    "both components may be polynomials but the inverse transformation @xmath4 has rational components .    in studying the dynamics of a mapping having rational components ,",
    "one encounters quickly that the mapping is ill - defined as a continuous one because of the existence of a finite set of indeterminacy points .",
    "the _ indeterminacy _ set @xmath5 of mapping @xmath0 is the finite set of points for which a component of @xmath6 has the form @xmath7 .",
    "polynomial mappings have , of course , no indeterminacy set .",
    "the _ critical set _",
    "consists of those algebraic varieties that cancel the jacobian @xmath8(u , v)$ ] of the mapping @xmath0 . including also the algebraic varieties such that @xmath8(u , v)=\\ , \\infty$ ] introduces the _",

    "_ mappings _ generally _ , the iterates of @xmath9 are _ not curves but blow - down into points _ : @xmath10 these points @xmath11 form the _ post critical set _  @xcite ( that we denote pc ) .",
    "knowing the full orbit ( [ pcgen ] ) may not be easy .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite the orbits @xmath12 have simple closed expressions .",
    "the orbits @xmath12 may have algebraic expressions with exponentially growing degrees _ in the parameters _  @xcite . for these examples and",
    "generically for a birational mapping , the post - critical set  @xcite ( pc ) is `` long '' meaning that , as the iteration proceeds , an infinite set of new points @xmath13 are obtained .",
    "the pc orbit _ may also be `` short '' _ by which it is meant that , after a finite number of iterations , the point @xmath13 settles in a fixed finite point , or in @xmath14 , and does not leave it .    in the framework  @xcite of a cohomology of curves in complex projective spaces , diller and favre have presented a method  @xcite , that gives the conditions on the parameters for which the mapping gets a complexity  @xcite lower than that of the generic case .",
    "this method amounts to matching the iterates of @xmath9 to the points of @xmath5 .",
    "the conditions @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) give the value of the parameter for which the mapping gets a lower complexity than that of the generic case  @xcite .",
    "in other words the _ complexity reduction _ , which breaks the analytically stable  @xcite character of the mapping , will correspond to situations where some points of the orbit of the exceptional locus ( @xmath17 ) encounter the indeterminacy set @xmath5 .    by `` complexity '' , it is meant many quantities . when one considers the degree @xmath18 of the numerators ( or denominators ) of the successive @xmath19-th iterate by mapping @xmath0 of a rational expression , the growth of this degree is ( generically ) exponential with @xmath20 : @xmath21 .",
    "the constant @xmath22 has been called the  growth - complexity ",
    "@xcite and for @xmath23 , is closely related to the _ arnold complexity _",
    "let us also recall that two universal ( or  topological  ) measures of the complexities were found to identify for many examples of birational transformations  @xcite , namely the previous ( degree ) growth - complexity  @xcite , arnold complexity  @xcite , and the ( exponential of the ) topological entropy  @xcite .",
    "the topological entropy is related to the growth rate , for increasing @xmath19 , of the number of fixed points of @xmath24  @xcite . for birational mappings",
    "it is given by the ( roots of the ) denominator of a _ rational _ generating function through the dynamical zeta function  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the number of fixed points at order @xmath20 .",
    "all the examples we have studied are _ birational mappings _",
    "@xcite , and we encountered the seemingly discrepancy for a mapping to have non - zero ( degree - growth  @xcite or arnold growth rate  @xcite ) complexity , or topological entropy  @xcite , while the orbits ( almost ) always _ look like _ curves having non - positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "the regions where the chaos  @xcite ( smale s horseshoe , homoclinic tangles , ... ) is `` hidden '' , should be concentrated in _ extremely narrow regions_. note that bedford and diller  @xcite showed , for the mapping of  @xcite , how to build the invariant measure corresponding to non - zero _ positive _ lyapunov exponents , which corresponds to a _ very slim cantor set_. note that this invariant _ real - measure _ is drastically different from the _ complex measure meromorphic two - form _ of the mapping .",
    "furthermore , we reported in a previous paper  @xcite on two birational mappings presenting very similar characteristics as far as topological concepts are concerned .",
    "they share the same identification between arnold complexity growth rate and the ( exponential of the ) topological entropy  @xcite .",
    "the complexity reduction corresponds to the same algebraic numbers given by the same family of polynomials with integer coefficients . otherwise ,",
    "leaving the algebraic - topologic description , these two mappings show different behaviors on other aspects .",
    "one mapping  @xcite preserves a meromorphic two - form   in the whole parameter space , while the other  @xcite does not have a preserved meromorphic two - form for generic values of the parameters .",
    "however , on some selected algebraic subvarieties of the parameter space , the second mapping has a meromorphic two - form .",
    "we showed in this case that , the fixed points of the birational mapping @xmath27 are such that @xmath28=\\ , 1 $ ] , where @xmath29 $ ] is the jacobian of @xmath24 evaluated at the fixed point of @xmath24 . for those cases , where a meromorphic two - form has not been found , the values of @xmath29",
    "$ ] for the fixed points of @xmath24 are different from 1 .",
    "we concluded that _ this mapping has no meromorphic two - form , since if it had one , this two - form would have to accomodate all these `` non standard '' fixed points whose number is infinite_.    in addition , we have considered  @xcite the vizualization of the iterates of arbitrary initial points showing structures which , though similar , are not converging towards the _ post - critical set _ that is the iterates of the critical set .",
    "no conclusion was drawn on the nature of these structures . in this respect ,",
    "one recalls the paper by bedford and diller  @xcite which discusses a criterion related to close approaches of the _ post - critical set _ to the indeterminacy locus .",
    "in this paper we focus on _ birational mappings _ , seizing the opportunity to use , for this specific class of transformations , the concept of _ post - critical sets _",
    "@xcite ( pc ) , that we show to be straightforwardly related to algebraic covariant curves and preserved meromorphic two - forms when they exist .",
    "we first recall some previously analyzed mappings ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) and one mapping @xmath32 taken from the literature , and show how to obtain , from the _ post critical set _",
    "@xcite , the ( algebraic ) covariant curves and the preserved meromorphic two - form .",
    "this analysis can be performed on either the forward mapping or the backward mapping . in both directions",
    "the post - critical set is long .",
    "a natural question arises then on whether the post - critical set of a birational mapping can be `` short '' in one direction and `` long '' in the other direction . what kind of structures do we expect ?",
    "a birational mapping of this kind would be a good example to study the matching between the two viewpoints ( topological and probabilistic ) of description of discrete dynamical systems .",
    "our aim is an attempt to link the short / long aspect of the post - critical set to the _ forward invariant _ set occurring in a polynomial mapping with _ strange attractor _",
    "@xcite .    unfortunately and to the best of our knowledge , most  @xcite of the _ strange attractors _ in two - dimensional _ invertible",
    "_ mappings found in the literature are _ polynomial _ transformations .",
    "this stems from the fact that it is common to consider an attracting set as bounded ( compact set ) .",
    "in typical situation ( neither necessary nor sufficient condition  @xcite ) , these structures arise when a mapping stretches and folds an open set , and maps its closure inside it . the unbounded chaotic trajectories that occur naturally in birational mappings are thought to be divergent orbits .",
    "we want , here , to build a birational ( one - parameter ) deformation of polynomial mappings .",
    "the first mapping @xmath33 we introduce is a birational deformation of the celebrated hnon map  @xcite .",
    "the deformed birational mapping depends on a further parameter @xmath34 which when fixed to zero gives back the original hnon map .",
    "this continuous deformation will show how the hnon _ strange attractor _ is modified .",
    "in the topological point of view , the deformed hnon map has the same degree - complexity for generic values of @xmath34 , while the strange attractor _ deforms continuously _ and the _ fractal dimension of the attractor varies _ continuously as a function of the deformation parameter @xmath35 . for this mapping , the post critical set is `` short '' in the forward direction ( and `` long '' in the backward direction ) .",
    "it has no covariant curve and no preserved meromorphic two - form .",
    "we introduce a second birational mapping @xmath0 , which will show that the boundedness is not required for the occurrence of an attracting chaotic set .",
    "first , we will compute its degree - growth complexity  @xcite and topological entropy  @xcite to show that the mapping is actually chaotic .",
    "the phase portraits of the mapping show an invariant structure",
    ". we will show that these structures _ pass the usual tests _",
    "commonly used to characterize the _ strange attractor _ ( positive lyapunov exponent and fractal dimension ) .",
    "these calculations are carried out even if the mapping has unbounded orbits .",
    "thanks to the simplicity of the mapping , the fixed points ( computed up to @xmath36 ) are real .",
    "these fixed points are all lying on the structure .",
    "the post critical set of @xmath0 is also `` short '' ( in the forward direction ) .",
    "this last mapping @xmath0 falls in a family of maps of two - steps recurrences of linear fractional transformation studied by bedford and kim  @xcite in terms of periodicities and degree growth rate  @xcite .",
    "periodicities in this type of recurrences have been studied in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ pc ] deals with the computation of the _ post critical sets _  @xcite ( pc ) for some birational mappings .",
    "these mappings being previously published , the aim is to show quickly the deep relation between the post critical set and the covariant curves of these known mappings . in section [ henondef ] ,",
    "we introduce a birationaly deformed hnon map . here",
    "also , we want to benefit from the much studied bipolynomial hnon map to establish the effect of the short post critical set .",
    "section [ secondmap ] presents the second two - dimensional birational mapping that has also a short post critical set and for which the arnold complexity growth rate and the ( exponential of the ) topological entropy identify . in section [ mappi ] , from the analytical expressions of the jacobian at the fixed points of the mapping up to @xmath37 , and the proliferation of what we call `` non - standard fixed points '' ( @xmath29 \\ , \\ne 1 $ ] ) , we conclude , on the non existence of a preserved meromorphic two - form . the phase portraits of the mapping show an attracting set , section ( [ ergo ] ) deals with an ergodic analysis .",
    "the lyapunov exponents are computed and the dimension of the attracting set is given by both kaplan - york conjecture and box - counting method .",

    "the cofactors associated with these algebraic covariants are such that a relation like ( [ prepreserv ] ) occurs allowing a preserved meromorphic two - form to exist .",

    ". had these iterates a closed form , and if the elimination of the index @xmath20 from @xmath104 and @xmath105 were possible , this would have given a _ non algebraic _ covariant curve .",
    "for this case , this _",
    "curve should simply shrink to @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "for the previous examples of birational mappings , we have straightforwardly obtained , from the post - critical set , the algebraic covariant curves , enabling in a second step to build the meromorphic two - forms preserved by the mappings .",
    "this has been possible for all cases where the orbits of the critical set are obtained in closed forms .",
    "we have found that this happens whenever the degree growth _ in the parameters for the iterates of the critical set _ is polynomial .",
    "this concept of `` degree growth in the parameters of the pc '' has been already introduced in  @xcite , giving a strong relation between the post critical set and meromorphic two - forms ( when they exist ) .",
    "one may define the post - critical set ( pc ) as `` integrable '' when the degree growth _ in the parameters _ of the orbits ( _ of the critical set _ ) is polynomial and `` non integrable '' otherwise . for the mappings @xmath38 , @xmath58 @xmath32 and @xmath31 ( for @xmath77 ) ,",

    "if any ) should be valid in both directions , the pc should be `` long '' in both directions .",
    "furthermore , when the `` long '' pc is integrable in one direction , it should be integrable in the other direction .",
