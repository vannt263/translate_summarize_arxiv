    "mechanical driving like shear can favour ordering since interfaces generally prefer to be aligned with the flow ( larson 1999 ) . in lamellar systems under shear , however , different stable orientations are possible ( fredrickson 1994 ) and in the ordering process ( cates & milner 1989 , corberi _ et al .",

    "the initial temperature is above @xmath10 with the walls at @xmath72 .",
    "we first show in figure 1 typical configurations of systems with very high viscosity .",
    "in this case we neglected the coupling with the velocity field by solving equation ( [ massdiff ] ) without the convective term .",
    "lamellar domains start to form close to the walls , where the temperature has become lower than the critical value , with interfaces perpendicular to the walls in agreement with the imposed neutral wetting conditions .",
    "then , following the temperature fronts , the regions with phase separated domains will extend towards the middle of the system .",
    "the pattern morphology , however , depends on the value of the thermal conductivity or , equivalently , on the speed of the temperature fronts . at very large @xmath0 ,",
    "the system remains frozen in intertwined noodle - like configurations without long range order , like that on the right of figure 1 , as observed in other simulations ( see , e.g. , gonnella _ et al .",
    "however , by decreasing the value of @xmath0 , in the interval @xmath73 $ ] , in spite of the adopted boundary conditions , the interfaces tend to follow the temperature fronts , parallel to the walls , and exhibit only few defects .",
    "the two fronts separating the regions with ordered lamellae from the central disordered region will approach each other joining at the later times of the simulation . by further decreasing @xmath0 , interfaces show the tendency to keep the perpendicular orientation with respect to the walls .",
    "this phenomenology has to be compared with that observed in simple binary mixtures where at large @xmath0 usual isotropic phase separation occurs ( of course , in binary mixtures , there is no frustration and the average size of domains grows by power law , see , e.g. , bray 1994 ) , while by lowering the values of the thermal conductivity one observes domains first parallel and then perpendicular to the cold walls ( tiribocchi _ et al .",
    "_ 2010 ) .    going to a lower viscosity ( @xmath74 ,",
    "see figure 2 ) , at very large @xmath0 , one finds that hydrodynamics favours the disentanglement of the network pattern ( gonnella _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) but one still observes extended defects between grains of different oriented lamellae ( see e.g. the grain with vertical orientation on the top - left region of the system opposed to the large horizontal underlying domain ) .",
    "one could see in systems larger than those here considered that these extended defects would slow down the ordering process at very late times ( xu _ et al . _ 2005 ) . at lower thermal conductivities , in the range @xmath75 $ ] , one again finds that lamellae are well aligned with the thermal fronts .",
    "the velocity helps this ordering and , indeed , very ordered defect - free lamellae can be observed ( compare the central snapshots of figure 1 and figure 2 ) in the regions close to the walls . in the central part ,",
    "even if structures can be observed , the local values of the field @xmath4 are nor in equilibrium , and further evolution will show a completely ordered lamellar state .",
    "finally , by further decreasing the value of @xmath0 , one sees in the left snapshot of figure 2 that hydrodynamics clearly helps the tendency of the system to prefer the perpendicular orientation .",
    "we also studied three - dimensional lamellar systems without coupling to the velocity field . at large values of @xmath0",
    "the system evolves towards metastable configurations ordered only on short scales , similarly to what occurs in two - dimensional systems , as it can be seen in the bottom snapshot of figure 3 . at lower values of @xmath0 ( @xmath76 )",
    "one can see stacks of lamellae parallel to the thermal fronts with very few defects ( central snapshot of figure 3 ) , while , again similarly to the two - dimensional case of figure 1 , perpendicular order is lost far from the walls at very low values of @xmath0 .",
    "in this work we have studied the ordering of a lamellar phase where the temperature cold fronts diffusively move from external walls .",
    "phase separation therefore starts close to the walls but develops in the middle of the systems with a phenomenology depending on the speed of the thermal fronts . in an intermediate range of values of thermal conductivity @xmath0 ,",
    "lamellae appear ordered and parallel to the thermal fronts while a perpendicular orientation is preferred at very low values of @xmath0 .",
    "hydrodynamics favours these preferred ordering and one can conclude that quenching with moving temperature fronts are effective in producing lamellar states with very few defects .",
