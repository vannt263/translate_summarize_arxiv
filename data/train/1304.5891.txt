    "the particular morphology and dimensions of nanowires ( nws ) have opened in the last years many perspectives in applications ranging from electronics , optoelectronics to energy harvesting and storage@xcite .",
    "the successful incorporation of dopants in the nanowires is key for the implementation of such devices .",
    "doping of nanowires has been a challenging task , due to the particular growth mechanisms@xcite . in this work",
    "we report on the electrical properties of c - doped gaas nanowires obtained by the ga - assisted method@xcite .",
    "as c is not soluble in ga , its incorporation in the nanowire core through the droplet remains difficult .",
    "our strategy is then to grow an intrinsic nw core and to grow a doped shell around it .",
    "we study the doping and surface effects in nws resistivity , field effect mobility as well as the minority carrier diffusion length .",
    "the nanowires consisted of an undoped gaas core of about 70 nm in diameter and a c - doped shell .",
    "the gaas nanowires were grown on a ( 111 ) si substrate under conditions that maximize the yield of vertical nanowires , as described elsewhere@xcite : a rotation of 7 rpm , a flux of ga equivalent to a planar growth rate of @xmath6 @xmath7 , a substrate temperature of @xmath8 @xmath9 and a v / iii beam equivalent pressure ( bep ) ratio of 50 .",
    "subsequently to the gaas nanowire synthesis , growth conditions were radically changed for the obtaining of a @xmath10 nm gaas shell .",
    "the ga flux was stopped for about 10 min while the substrate temperature was lowered to @xmath11 @xmath9 and the v / iii bep ratio was increased to @xmath12@xcite .",
    "a p - type doping was achieved by adding a flux of carbon during the growth of the shell . to test the effect of c doping",
    ", we grew a series of samples with different c flux given by the current applied to the cell , as reported in table 1 .",
    "equivalent samples have been fabricated with the addition of a capping layer consisting of 15 nm al@xmath13ga@xmath14as and 6 nm of intrinsic gaas .",
    "+ to give an accurate estimation the resistivity of the nanowires , multiple contacts were fabricated@xcite .",
    "multiple four point measurements have been performed on around 100 samples .",
    "the realization of a large number of devices has been automatized thanks to our auto - contacting software @xcite .",
    "the electrical contacts consisted of pd / ti / au ( @xmath15 nm ) metal layer directly in contact with the doped shell . for the capped nanowires ,",

    "bottom gate transistors , with 200 nm thick sio@xmath18 layer used as a gate dielectric , were realized in order to extract the nanowire majority carrier mobility .",
    "surface states play an extremely important role in the opto - electronic properties of gaas nanowires . in ambient conditions",
    "there is a formation of a thin oxide layer on the nw surface resulting in a pinning of the fermi level . in gaas",
    "the pinning occurs near the middle of the band gap , producing a depletion region .",
    "the existence of this region reduces the electrically active part of the nws@xcite .",
    "we can avoid this problem by passivating the gaas with a wider band gap semiconductor , such as algaas@xcite . in this study",

    ", we can consider that the electrically active part corresponds to the entire doped shell .",
    "we can therefore introduce the conductivity of the doped shell @xmath32 calculated on the doped cross section area and directly extract the doping density @xmath33    when nws are not passivated , one needs to consider the fermi level pinning at the nw surface and the existence of a depletion layer . solving the poisson equation and using the boundary conditions of a vanishing electric field at the surface we can calculate the depletion region width . for the doping concentration analyzed , the surface potential @xmath34 at the gaas surface is found to be around @xmath35 ev@xcite .",

    "this behavior is commonly observed in semiconductors and is related to the scattering of carriers by the doping impurities .",
    "interestingly , we observe a reduction of mobility with the increase in carrier concentration , which results in the saturation of the resistivity for doping concentrations higher than @xmath43 @xmath4 .",

    "the numerical analysis has been performed with @xmath50 . ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] holes are mainly distributed in the doped shell , but a small portion is also found in the core . in the case of unpassivated wires , the surface depletion leads to a decrease in the amount of carriers in the shell .",
    "this is especially notable for the low doping concentration . from this",
    "we conclude that two mechanisms may contribute to the observation that the highest mobility is for low doped unpassivated nws .",
    "first , the depletion region in unpassivated and low doped nws ensures that transport of carriers occurs at a certain distance from the surface and reduces the surface - related scattering .",
    "second , a higher proportion of the transport occurs through the undoped core , which exhibits highest mobility due to the absence of dopants .",
    "+ finally , we used electron beam induced current ( ebic ) to study the mean free path of minority carriers .",
    "the semiconductor - metal interface at the contacts produces a schottky barrier .",
    "when exciting electron - hole pairs with light or an electron beam , the potential gradient produced by the schottky barrier attracts minority carriers ( electrons ) into the contacts , which is measured by an electrical current .",
    "the current exponentially decays with the distance from the contact @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the electron mean free path . in order to understand what region of the nanowire",
    "is excited with the electron beam , we simulate the trajectory of electrons from the beam with casino @xcite , shown in ( fig . [ fig3]a ) .",
    "we simulate the trajectories of 200 incident electrons with an energy of @xmath53 kev and a probe current of @xmath54 pa , corresponding to the experimental conditions used . as it can be seen in fig .",

    "b ) experimental current decay as a function of distance to the contact for 3 nws samples ( 2u , 2p and 4p ) .",
    "the minority carrier mean free path extracted increase up to @xmath5 nm for passivated nws with a doping concentration of @xmath56 @xmath4 . ]",
    "figure [ fig3]b shows the exponential decay of the current for an unpassivated and two passivated nws with hole concentrations respectively of @xmath57 and @xmath49 @xmath58 .",
    "the lowest mean free path is @xmath59 nm for the unpassivated nanowire .",
    "the passivated nanowires exhibit longer mean free paths for minority carriers , up to @xmath5 nm .",
    "despite the majority carrier ( holes ) mobility is lower for passivated nws , a longer diffusion path is found for the minority carriers ( electrons ) .",
    "this is explained again by the fermi level pinning at the surface and its respective electric field , which attracts the beam - induced electrons towards the surface .",
    "consequently , the electron main free path in unpassivated nws is reduced by the larger defect and trap densities at the surface .",
    "in conclusion , we have measured the carrier concentration , mobility and minority diffusion length for core - shell gaas nanowires were the shell is c - doped at different concentrations .",
    "the effect of the surface states is evaluated by comparing the values for passivated and unpassivated nws . at low doping concentrations",
    "the highest mobility is observed for unpassivated nanowries , while at higher doping concentrations the passivated nanowires offer the best characteristics . the highest mobility ( 30 @xmath60/(v@xmath1s ) )",
    "was obtained for unpassivated nws with a doping concentration of @xmath61 @xmath60/(v@xmath1s ) .",
