    "theoretical dynamical models continue to play a key role in stellar dynamics , as understanding their underlying structure helps shed light on the properties of numerical and observational stellar systems and dark matter haloes . in this paper , we focus our attention on the relation between the density slope @xmath2 and the velocity anisotropy profile @xmath3 , which has attracted renewed interest lately .",
    "as is well known , @xcite proved that the central inequality @xmath4 is a necessary condition for the positivity of the distribution function ( df ) of a spherical system .",
    "more recently however @xcite showed that @xmath5 at all radii ( hereafter called the global density slope  anisotropy relation , gdsai ) is a necessary condition for positivity of the df , if @xmath6 , in the families of multi - component osipkov - merritt @xcite , cuddeford @xcite , and cuddeford - louis models @xcite , as well as for the plummer models of @xcite , the hernquist models of , and the models we introduced in ( hereafter ) .",
    "their proof is based on the fact that all these models are characterized by having a separable augmented density ( see section  [ augdens.sec ] ) .",
    "they also note that currently , no counter - examples of the gdsai are known , but remark that in the case of cuddeford models with a central anisotropy @xmath1 the gdsai is only a sufficient condition , so that possible counter - examples could be found in this range of values .",
    "these results pose the question under which conditions the gdsai holds for all spherical systems . in this paper",
    ", we make important advancements by providing a complete analysis of the gdsai for all well - behaved systems with a separable augmented density .",
    "this group includes all aforementioned models , as well as the hypervirial models of @xcite , the @xmath7-models of @xcite and the dehnen - mclaughlin systems discussed in @xcite ( hereafter ) , among others .",
    "first , we show that the gdsai holds for all separable systems , if @xmath6 , by proving an equivalent criterion formulated by @xcite . in this manner",
    ", we extend their previous results .",
    "our analysis also reveals some very peculiar properties of separable systems .",
    "furthermore , we show that counter - examples of the gdsai do exist for separable systems with @xmath1 , in other words , we demonstrate that the gdsai is not a universal property . however , the velocity distributions of these models are extreme , and all counter - examples are very likely dynamically unstable .",
    "first , we outline in section  [ models.sec ] the general concepts of spherical dynamical models . in section  [ augdens.sec ] , we describe the augmented density framework . in section  [ analysis.sec ] ,",
    "we give our analysis of the gdsai for separable systems : we prove the inequality for models with @xmath6 , and we present three counter - examples with @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in section  [ conclusions.sec ] .",
    "the dynamical structure of a spherical gravitational equilibrium system , governed by a positive potential @xmath8 , is completely determined by the non - negative phase - space distribution function ( df ) @xmath9 . for spherical systems , this df is a function @xmath10 of the isolating integrals , the binding energy @xmath11 and the angular momentum @xmath12 : @xmath13 with @xmath14 the transverse velocity . from the df ,",
    "the velocity moments @xmath15 can be obtained , with @xmath16 the total mass of the system . in particular , the density and the second - order moments are @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the density slope and the velocity anisotropy profile are defined as @xmath19 spherical dynamical models satisfy the jeans equation @xmath20 which can be written as @xmath21 with @xmath22 evidently , it follows that @xmath23 @xcite showed that several systems ( see introduction ) satisfy a stronger condition , the gdsai @xmath24 and they pose the question whether this condition holds for all spherical systems . naturally , the inequality is valid outside the radius @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "it is also valid at @xmath27 , as was proven by @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the gdsai for a particular class of systems , namely those with a separable augmented density .",
    "a spherical dynamical system can also described by an augmented velocity moment ( @xcite ; ) , which extends the moment to an explicit function @xmath28 of both the radius and the gravitational potential .",
    "an augmented moment is equivalent to the df : the knowledge of one augmented moment determines the entire system . in particular , we will consider the augmented density @xmath29 , and its relationship with the df is given by @xmath30 this integral equation can in principle be inverted to obtain the df by using laplace - mellin transforms , although in practice the inversion is only numerically stable for sufficiently smooth systems .",
    "the strength of the augmented density framework lies in its direct connection to observable quantities like the velocity moments .",
    "for instance , the augmented velocity dispersion profiles are given by @xmath31      { { \\text{d}}}\\psi ' , \\label{gensigt : def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath33 .",
    "the observed density and dispersions are then simply recovered from @xmath34 and the density slope is @xmath35 as remarked in the introduction , ciotti & morganti have examined the gdsai in several systems with a separable augmented density , i.e.  systems of the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 . for such models ,",
    "the dispersion profiles read @xmath38 note that the radial velocity dispersion is now only a function of @xmath39 .",
    "the velocity anisotropy profile of these systems has the simple form @xmath40 as we demonstrated in and , this property provides a very elegant way to construct dynamical models with a given potential , density and velocity anisotropy .",
    "indeed , separable systems are completely determined by @xmath8 , @xmath41 and @xmath3 , since @xmath42 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ betadv ] ) and , by inverting @xmath8 , the function @xmath43 follows from @xmath44 however , one still needs to verify whether the corresponding df is non - negative everywhere .",
    "( [ slopegen ] ) now reduces to @xmath45 so that we obtain @xmath46 in other words , as remarked by ciotti & morganti , the gdsai @xmath47 is for separable systems equivalent to the statement @xmath48 the question thus becomes whether this inequality is valid for all separable systems . in the following section ,",
    "we will prove that this is indeed the case , if @xmath6 .",
    "following the reasoning of @xcite , we assume that any well - behaved df can be written in the form @xmath49 with @xmath50 the function @xmath51 in this ansatz can be understood as the leading term of a laurent series expansion in @xmath12 at @xmath52 . towards the center @xmath53 ,",
    "the df is dominated by this term , which has the form of a system with constant anisotropy .",
    "consequently , the central anisotropy of the entire model indeed corresponds with @xmath54 .",
    "since the df has to be non - negative everywhere , it follows immediately that @xmath55 is a necessary condition to obtain a physically meaningful df .",
    "if we consider separable systems , the corresponding augmented density then has the form @xmath56 using @xmath57 , the relation between the augmented density and the df  ( [ rhodf ] ) can be written as @xmath58 in separable systems , it follows that @xmath59 since the left - hand side of this equation is independent of the radius @xmath60 , the right - hand side does not depend on @xmath60 either .",
    "the equality is therefore valid for all values @xmath60 ; in particular , we can take the limit of @xmath60 towards the center , @xmath61 this property is the key element to prove the gdsai when @xmath62 : using ( [ dfcond ] ) and ( [ fpsilim ] ) , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ rhodfappend ] ) that @xmath63 remarkably , the function @xmath43 thus only depends on @xmath64 and @xmath54 . in other words , for separable systems",
    "the function @xmath65 has no influence on the gdsai .",
    "concrete examples of this behavior are furnished in the systems considered by ciotti & morganti .",
    "for instance , the equivalent function @xmath66 in @xcite for generalized cuddeford systems does not depend on the anisotropy radius @xmath67 ( see their eq .",
    "( 13 ) ) .",
    "the value of @xmath54 splits our further analysis into three cases : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath1 .      if @xmath68 , the derivative of @xmath43 becomes @xmath70 .",
    "\\label{dfpsi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us examine the first term inside the brackets : if @xmath71 then @xmath72 so that @xmath73 in other words , if the limit is nonzero , then the integral in the second term becomes infinite .",
    "the limit can therefore be omitted , so that the equation is simplified to @xmath74 and recalling eq .",
    "( [ gdsai ] ) , the gdsai is proven .",
    "the above relation can be generalized further : if @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the integer floor and fractional part of @xmath77 , then @xmath78 so the inequalities @xmath79 are necessary conditions to obtain a separable system with a non - negative df .",
    "this extends the results obtained by @xcite for multi - component cuddeford models .      when @xmath69 , eq .",
    "( [ fpsi ] ) reduces to @xmath80 the derivative is then simply @xmath81 so evidently , the gdsai is again a necessary condition for a physical dynamical model .",
    "the proof is not applicable to systems with @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the derivative has the same form as eq .",
    "( [ dfpsi ] ) , but now the two terms inside the brackets are respectively @xmath82 and @xmath83 when @xmath84 , so their sum is undetermined .",
    "however , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ fpsi ] ) using integration by parts as @xmath85,\\ ] ] where @xmath86 denotes the derivative of @xmath64 .",
    "after differentiation , we then obtain @xmath87 . \\label{betagt1/2}\\ ] ] thus , separable systems with a monotonically increasing @xmath64 ( i.e.  @xmath88 ) , satisfy the gdsai . again",
    ", this is an extension of the results for generalized cuddeford systems found by @xcite .",
    "yet , the gdsai is no longer a necessary condition for a physical model , which raises the question whether systems can be found for which the global inequality does not hold . to this aim , we consider the potential - density pair @xmath89 with corresponding density slope @xmath90 which is part of the family of veltmann models or @xmath91-models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and was discussed by @xcite . if @xmath92 , then the system is also self - consistent . for this pair ,",
    "we construct physical dfs that generate four - parameter anisotropy profiles of the form @xmath93 with @xmath94 , so that @xmath95 with @xmath96 again , our systems have separable augmented densities . for every anisotropy profile",
    ", the function @xmath43 follows from @xmath97 , and the df can be found by inverting eq .",
    "( [ rhodf ] ) . instead of performing these calculations directly ,",
    "we adopt the technique used in : we first generate a family of components of the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are three parameters , and @xmath102 are normalization constants .",
    "the corresponding dfs are ( see ; ) @xmath103 for @xmath104 , and @xmath105 for @xmath106 . with different values of the parameters , a library of base functions",
    "is thus created , from which a linear combination is built that fits the given density @xmath41 at various radii .",
    "this is achieved by minimizing the quantity @xmath107 using a quadratic programming algorithm @xcite .",
    "the details of this procedure can be found in . in particular , we created models with @xmath108 components , fitting 25 density data points extracted from eq .",
    "( [ rhomoore ] ) .    with this technique ,",
    "we obtain several dynamical models with non - negative dfs that violate the gdsai ; three of them are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1.sec ] .",
    "all three share the anisotropy parameters @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , but have different values for @xmath112 : 0.3 , 0.6 and 1.0 respectively ; note that the latter is a cuddeford - type model .",
    "for the model with @xmath113 , we find that @xmath114 for radii in the interval @xmath1150,0.021]$ ] , with a minimum around @xmath116 ( note that the center is a local maximum , for which @xmath117 ) . in the model with @xmath118 ,",
    "the @xmath119 relation reaches a local maximum around @xmath120 , and the gdsai does not hold in the interval @xmath121 $ ] , with a minimum around @xmath122 .",
    "finally the largest @xmath119 fluctuations occur in the cuddeford model ( @xmath123 ) , with a local maximum around @xmath124 , and a gdsai violation within @xmath125 $ ] , with a minimum for @xmath126 .",
    "evidently , we require rather extreme parameter values to obtain these ( modest ) violations , while maintaining non - negative dfs .",
    "the central anisotropy @xmath54 has to be high , and the profile @xmath3 has to increase very rapidly .",
    "it is therefore safe to assume that the self - consistent variants of these models are dynamically unstable .",
    "this can be seen from the standard criterion for radial - orbit instability : @xmath127 8.26 and 10.42 for the three models , which is much higher than the @xmath128 threshold for similar models ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "further evidence of dynamical instability is given by the radial velocity distributions @xmath129 as shown in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ figure1.sec ] , these profiles have two or three peaks at small radii .",
    "these are indications of hnon instabilities ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) . in theory ,",
    "if the systems are instead not self - consistent but embedded in a massive dark matter halo , they might withstand these instabilities ; however , one can safely argue that such equilibrium systems are too extreme to arise in structure formation .",
    "finally , we remark that the function @xmath64 can be derived from @xmath43 by means of an abel - related inversion @xcite , which holds for all values of @xmath130 , @xmath131 where again @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the integer floor and fractional part of @xmath77 . thus the additional condition @xmath132 is sufficient to obtain a non - negative @xmath64 .",
    "as @xcite showed , this also implies that the entire df @xmath10 is non - negative in the case of generalized cuddeford systems .",
    "however , it is not a priori clear whether this property is true for all separable systems , since the behavior of @xmath65 might still lead to negative values of the df .",
    "further study is therefore needed to determine if eq .",
    "( [ sufcond ] ) is a sufficient condition for the existence of a physical separable model .",
    "in the previous section , we presented a full analysis of the gdsai for spherical dynamical systems with a separable augmented density .",
    "as our proof shows , the gdsai hold if the central velocity anisotropy @xmath0 .",
    "we further demonstrated that systems with @xmath133 , the gdsai can be broken , as shown by three counter - examples , although these systems are not physically realistic .",
    "( [ betalt1/2 ] ) and ( [ betaeq1/2 ] ) , combined with eq .",
    "( [ gdsai ] ) , also reveal a remarkable property of separable systems : the gdsai is purely determined by @xmath54 and @xmath64 .",
    "the function @xmath64 can be interpreted in various ways : it can be thought of as the phase - space distribution of particles at purely radial orbits , as the phase - space distribution of particles at the center , or as the energy distribution of the constant - anisotropy component of the df . as a surprising consequence ,",
    "if a separable system has a given potential @xmath8 and density @xmath41 , then knowledge of @xmath64 alone is sufficient to construct the complete df of the system .",
    "indeed , we showed that @xmath64 is equivalent with @xmath43 , and in combination with @xmath41 , the function @xmath134 can also be derived , determining the augmented density @xmath135 and thus @xmath10 .",
    "the next logical step will be to investigate the gdsai for general , non - separable spherical models .",
    "one possible approach would be to consider a spherical systems as a linear combination of separable systems .",
    "in fact , an analytic @xmath29 or @xmath10 can be written as a double sum of power - law functions , by means of a two - dimensional laurent series expansion .",
    "an alternative approach would be to ask the following question : given a spherical dynamical system with a given @xmath8 and a df that generates @xmath41 and @xmath3 , does there always exist a separable model with a non - negative df that generates the same density and anisotropy ? as we mentioned in section  [ augdens.sec ]",
    ", the function @xmath42 follows directly from @xmath3 , and in turn this determines @xmath43 from @xmath42 and @xmath41 .",
    "however , there is no a priori reason that the corresponding df is also non - negative .",
    "if it is , the same gdsai analysis applies as presented in this paper .",
    "we currently do not know of any @xmath136 pair that can only be generated by non - separable models , but more study is required to resolve these questions .",
    "we think our analysis of separable systems can be a useful stepping stone for further investigations of the gdsai for spherical dynamical systems ."
