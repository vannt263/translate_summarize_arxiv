    "neutrinos have provided our first glimpse into physics beyond the standard model of elementary particles ( sm ) .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments have given us unambiguous evidence that the three active neutrinos have mass and mix ( see @xcite for recent reviews of neutrino theory and phenomenology ) .",
    "as most important discoveries , the results of these experiments have raised more questions than they answered . even from our limited knowledge of the neutrinos , it is clear that their properties , including sub - ev masses and large mixing , are quite different from their charged fermion counterparts .",
    "the true explanation of this puzzling behavior likely rests on the fact that neutrinos are the only known fundamental neutral fermions , but the exact reason behind this is still open to speculation .",
    "neutrino masses , as deduced from oscillation experiments , hint at the existence of right - handed neutrino states , lepton number violation , new sources of cp violation , as well as a new energy scale .",
    "the seesaw mechanism @xcite is an appealing way to generate the observed neutrino masses and lepton mixing matrix .",
    "the idea is simple .",
    "add an arbitrary number of singlet fermion states to the sm matter content .",
    "the triviality of their quantum numbers allows them to have majorana masses of magnitude @xmath0 , as well as couple to the @xmath3 lepton and higgs doublets .",
    "the latter vertices become dirac mass terms of magnitude @xmath4 after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the standard theoretical prejudice is that the dirac masses are of order the charged fermion masses , while the majorana masses are at some very high energy scale , @xmath5  gev . if this is indeed the case , the resulting propagating neutrino degrees of freedom separate into two quasi - decoupled groups : mostly active states with very small masses @xmath6 suppressed by the new physics scale , and mostly sterile states with very large masses @xmath0 . in this scenario ,",
    "the mostly right - handed states are not directly observable .",
    "indeed , it is possible that if such a high - energy seesaw is realized in nature , its only observable consequence is that the mostly active neutrinos have mass and mix .    of course , there is no direct evidence that @xmath0  which we refer to as the seesaw scale  is large .",
    "large @xmath0 values are attractive for several reasons , including the fact that one may relate @xmath0 to the grand unified scale . on the other hand , all @xmath0 values are technically natural , given that when @xmath0 vanishes the global symmetry structure of the lagrangian is enhanced : @xmath7 is a symmetry of the lagrangian if @xmath8 , so that @xmath0 is often referred to as the lepton number breaking scale . this point was recently emphasized in @xcite .",
    "recent analyses have also revealed that there are several low - energy choices for the seesaw energy scale that allow one to address outstanding problems in particle physics and astrophysics .",
    "the main reason for this is that , unlike in the high - energy seesaw , in a low - energy seesaw the mostly right - handed states do not decouple but remain as kinematically accessible sterile neutrinos .",
    "the data reported by the lsnd short baseline neutrino oscillation experiment @xcite can be explained by postulating the existence of light ( @xmath9  ev ) sterile neutrino states .",
    "this result is currently being tested by the fermilab miniboone experiment @xcite and , if confirmed , will lead the community to seriously contemplate the existence of light , sm singlet fermions .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that if @xmath10  ev , the right - handed seesaw neutrinos can easily play the role of the lsnd sterile neutrinos .",
    "there is also evidence for mixed sterile neutrinos at other energy scales : ev sterile neutrinos aid in heavy element nucleosynthesis in supernovae , kev sterile neutrinos can help explain the peculiar velocity of pulsars , and remain viable warm dark matter candidates . in the past several months",
    ", it has been shown that the seesaw right - handed neutrinos may play the role of all these astrophysically / cosmologically inspired sterile neutrinos @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the phenomenology of low - energy ( @xmath2  kev ) seesaw scenarios , extending the analysis performed in @xcite in several ways . in sec .",
    "[ sec : seesawmass ] , we review the generation of neutrino mass via the seesaw mechanism and apply it to relatively light right - handed neutrino states .",

    "[ sec : pheno ] , we review the several different `` evidences '' for sterile neutrinos , and discuss whether these can be `` fit '' by the low - energy seesaw .",
    "we concentrate on exploring solutions that can accommodate at the same time the lsnd anomaly and the astrophysical processes outlined above , but also discuss different combinations of the seesaw parameters capable of explaining only the astrophysics - related observables . in sec .",
    "[ sec : future ] , we examine other experimental probes that can be used to explore low - energy seesaws  regardless of their relationship to the lsnd anomaly , pulsar kicks , and warm dark matter .",
    "we concentrate on the prospects of current / future tritium beta - decay and neutrinoless double - beta decay experiments .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] by summarizing our results , commenting on the plausibility of this scenario , and offering a general outlook for the future .",
    "in order to account for nonzero neutrino masses , we add to the sm particle content three @xmath11 gauge singlet fermion states @xmath12 , conventionally referred to as right - handed neutrinos . while sterile under sm gauge interactions , right - handed neutrinos may still be charged under new , currently unknown gauge transformations .",
    "such interactions , if at all present , are neglected in our analysis .",
    "the most general renormalizable lagrangian consistent with sm gauge invariance is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the traditional sm lagrangian , @xmath15 is the higgs weak doublet , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , are lepton weak doublets , @xmath18 are neutrino yukawa couplings , and @xmath19 are majorana masses for the @xmath12 .",
    "we choose , without loss of generality , the majorana mass matrix @xmath20 to be diagonal and its eigenvalues @xmath19 to be real and positive .",
    "we also choose the charged lepton yukawa interactions and the charged weak current interactions diagonal so that all physical mixing elements are contained in the neutrino sector .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking ( when @xmath15 develops a vacuum expectation value @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 will describe , aside from all other sm degrees of freedom , six neutral massive weyl fermions  six neutrinos . the resulting mass terms can be expressed as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are vectors of the three active neutrinos @xmath27 and the three right - handed , sterile states , respectively .",
    "each entry in the symmetric mass matrix of eq  ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) is itself a @xmath28 matrix of mass parameters .",
    "diagonalization of the mass matrix yields eigenstates with majorana masses that mix the active  active states , related via the standard lepton mixing matrix @xmath29 , and the active  sterile states .",

    "an illustrative example is found by considering the mass ordering of @xmath20 in its diagonal form .",

    "the corresponding neutrino mass values and the sm couplings we can calculate all observable quantities and compare them with data .    it is natural to wonder how well the seesaw approximation holds once one starts to deal with @xmath20 values around 1  ev . from eq .",

    "therefore , first order corrections are @xmath54 of the leading order terms , while second order corrections are near @xmath55 .",
    "corrections to most observables of interest are much smaller than this because they are suppressed by larger right - handed neutrino masses . the first non - trivial correction to eq .",
    "( [ eq : thetam_constraint ] ) occurs at second order and we find that , for the ambitions of this paper , all approximations are under control .",
    "this simple argument has been verified numerically for the most worrisome cases .    before concluding this section , we wish to add that operators that lead , after electroweak symmetry breaking , to majorana masses for the left",
    " handed neutrino states ( @xmath56 ) are also allowed if one introduces @xmath3 higgs boson triplets or nonrenormalizable operators to the sm lagrangian .",
    "while we neglect these `` active '' majorana masses , we caution the reader that the existence of such terms would alter our results significantly .",

    "[ subsec : kicks ] ) , which both require at least one kev neutrino , while the other two mostly sterile states help `` explain '' the existing oscillation data where , for all practical purposes , the heaviest neutrino decouples and we are left with an effective @xmath62 or @xmath63 picture .",
    "we remind readers that a third possibility ( 2 + 2 ) is currently ruled out by solar and atmospheric data @xcite and will be ignored .",
    "@xmath62 schemes that address the lsnd anomaly are also disfavored by global analysis of short baseline oscillation experiments @xcite , and for this reason , we mostly concentrate on @xmath63 fits to the lsnd anomaly @xcite .",

    "the quotation marks around `` fit '' and `` data '' are meant to indicate that our methods are crude , in the sense that we are fitting to previously processed experimental data , assuming a diagonal correlation matrix with gaussian uncertainties . in order to avoid the subtleties involved in such a `` fit to a fit '' , we hesitate to mention actual confidence intervals , but are compelled to do so for lack of a better measure of an allowed region .",
    "we sometimes present our best fit parameter points along with confidence intervals , but warn the reader to avoid strict interpretations of these numbers . while crude , our methodology of error analysis and fitting provides a very useful instrument for identifying whether ( and how ) the low - energy seesaw can accommodate a particular combination of data sets .    before proceeding , it is useful to cement our notation .",
    "the neutrino masses will be ordered in ascending order of magnitude from @xmath70 to @xmath71 in the case of a normal active neutrino mass hierarchy ( @xmath72 ) , while in the case of an inverted mass hierarchy they are ordered @xmath73 ( in this case @xmath74 ) .",

    "we will assume that all solar , reactor , long - baseline and atmospheric data are properly fit with active  active oscillations , and that constraints on the other seesaw parameters will be provided mostly by short - baseline accelerator experiments .",
    "it is interesting to note that the inclusion of the angles @xmath49 introduces enormous freedom into the system .",
    "any one active  sterile mixing angle contained in @xmath33 can always be set to zero by an appropriate choice of @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , all but three elements may be set to zero simultaneously , with only a single non - zero element in each row and column . in this case , these are constrained to be around @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the column of the non - zero element .",
    "this is especially true when the mostly active neutrino masses are quasi - degenerate .",
    "an important `` sum rule of thumb '' is the following .",

    "<S> the standard model augmented by the presence of gauge - singlet right - handed neutrinos proves to be an ideal scenario for accommodating nonzero neutrino masses . among the new parameters of this `` new standard model '' are right - handed neutrino majorana masses @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical prejudice points to @xmath0 much larger than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , but it has recently been emphasized that all @xmath0 values are technically natural and should be explored . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , @xmath0 around @xmath1  ev can accommodate an elegant oscillation solution to the lsnd anomaly , while other @xmath0 values lead to several observable consequences . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the phenomenology of low energy ( @xmath2  kev ) seesaw scenarios . by exploring such a framework with three right - handed neutrinos </S>",
    "<S> , we can consistently fit all oscillation data  including those from lsnd  while partially addressing several astrophysical puzzles , including anomalous pulsar kicks , heavy element nucleosynthesis in supernovae , and the existence of warm dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , low - energy seesaws  regardless of their relation to the lsnd anomaly  can also be tested by future tritium beta - decay experiments , neutrinoless double - beta decay searches , and other observables . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the sensitivity of such probes to @xmath0 . </S>"
