    "in recent years , a lot of works has been devoted to the study of the phase structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "qcd is an asymptotically free theory and the interactions between quarks and gluons become weak at high energy@xcite .",
    "then , at high temperature and/or density , the quarks and gluons constitute rather weakly interacting system , which is called the quark - gluon plasma . on the other hand , at low temperature and density ,",
    "quarks and gluons are confined into hadrons and can not be observed as free particles . furthermore , the existence of the color superconducting phases at low temperature and moderate baryon density has been widely accepted .",
    "the color superconductivity is the state where the quark - quark ( diquark ) cooper pairs@xcite are induced by the attractive interaction in the color antitriplet channel@xcite .",
    "one of the simple theories to study the above mentioned subject is the nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , which is a low energy effective field theory of qcd@xcite .",
    "the njl model successfully describes the qcd phase structure , and a variety of works has been devoted to the study on the basis of the njl model .",
    "( for nice reviews , see , e.g. @xcite . ) in particular , through analysis on the competition between quark - antiquark ( @xmath1 ) and diquark ( @xmath2 ) condensates in the njl model , it has been found that there appears the coexisting phase of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 condensed phases ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the study of the phase structure of the njl model in lower dimensions ( d ) is also an interesting issue since the models usually become simpler in lower dimensions@xcite .",
    "indeed , the gross neveu ( gn ) model@xcite , which is the counterpart of the njl model in 2d and 3d , becomes renormalizable .",
    "recently , the phase structure of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 condensates was studied within the 3d gn model@xcite . there",
    "the quarks are assigned to the lowest nontrivial ( 2-dimensional ) representation of the @xmath3 group which we refer to as the 2-component ( 2c ) quarks .",
    "the resultant phase diagrams show that there does not appear the region where the @xmath1 and @xmath2 condensates coexist , which is in sharp contrast to the 4d njl case .",
    "this difference may stem from the difference in form of the @xmath2 condensate term in the lagrangian density between both cases . in the 2c quark case in 3d , the @xmath2 condensate term in the lagrangian does not include the @xmath4 matrix , which leads to the above - mentioned difference .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , the @xmath4 enters in the case of the 4c quarks in 3d . in this sense , the 3d gn model with the 4c quarks",
    "is expected to bear closer resemblance to the 4d njl model .",
    "actually , in vacuum ( zero temperature and chemical potential ) theory , the coexisting phase of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 condensates has been found in the 3d gn model with the 4c quarks@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the @xmath1 and @xmath2 condensates at finite temperature and density in the 3d 2 flavor massless gn model with the 4c quarks .",
    "we construct the phase diagrams , and discuss the similarities and differences among the models , the 3d gn model with the 4c quarks , the 3d gn model with the 2c quarks and the 4d njl model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii we introduce the lagrangian density in the 3d gn model with the 4c quarks and employ the mean - field approximation . in sec.iii",
    "the derivation of the thermodynamic potential is given .",
    "then , in sec.iv , we show the numerical results for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 condensates at zero and finite temperature . in sec.v ,",
    "the phase diagrams of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 condensates are obtained .",
    "sec.vi is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "following the same reasoning as described in @xcite , we employ the lagrangian density : @xmath5 the notations used in eq.([gn4c ] ) are the same as in the 3d 2 flavor massless gn model with the 2c quarks given in @xcite , except that the @xmath6 matrices are @xmath7 matrices here . for the @xmath6 matrices ,",
    "we use the same form as in @xcite , @xmath8 the charge conjugated fields are given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .    employing the mean - field approximation ,",
    "we have @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the order parameters for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 condensates , which are defined by @xmath14",

    "it should be noted that the thermodynamic potential has two free parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "as in @xcite , we take @xmath39 to be the scale of the theory ( @xmath43 ) . then , after fixing @xmath39 , there remains one free parameter @xmath40 and we study the various values for the ratio @xmath44 .",
    "in this section , we show the numerical result of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 condensates through analyzing the thermodynamic potential , eq.([rethermo ] ) .",

    ", the @xmath1 condensate falls and the @xmath2 condensate arises . the transition chemical potentials are @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively . thus the transition chemical potential becomes smaller with increasing the ratio @xmath44 , and the value of the @xmath2 condensate @xmath13 enlarges . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the @xmath2 condensate at @xmath54 has the close value with the @xmath1 condensate , and it eventually exceeds the @xmath1 condensate for @xmath55 . note that the @xmath1 condensate does not exist for @xmath55 and there appears only the @xmath2 condensate .",
    "thus we see that the behaviors of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 condensates are sensitive to the value of the ratio @xmath44 .",

    "we refer this phase to as the ",
    "double broken \" ( db ) phase .",
    "thus , the system is characterized by the following phases :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ q : @xmath1 condensate phase ( @xmath63,@xmath64 ) + d : @xmath2 condensate phase ( @xmath65,@xmath66 ) + db : double broken phase ( @xmath63,@xmath66 ) + n : normal phase ( @xmath65,@xmath64 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    all of these phases appear in the case of @xmath67 ( panel ( c ) ) .",
    "however the q phase does not appear for @xmath53 and only d phase and db phase appear .",
    "thus , as the ratio @xmath44 increases , the q condensate phase shrinks toward @xmath16 axis and the region of d phase and db phase become larger .",
    "the points ( @xmath68 ) in the panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) indicate the critical points from the first order phase transition to the second order one .",
    "the phase transition below the critical temperature @xmath69 is of the first order and above @xmath69 is of the second order .",
    "we notice that the value of @xmath69 increases when @xmath44 becomes larger , while @xmath70 decreases with increasing @xmath44 .",
    "then the critical point moves upward along the transition line , and the region of the first order phase transition expands .",
    "the other phase transitions , namely the transitions q @xmath71 db , q @xmath71 n and d @xmath71 n , are of the second order .",
    "through studying the @xmath1 and @xmath2 condensates at finite temperature and chemical potential , we have obtained the phase diagrams in the 3d gn model with the 4c quarks .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath1 condensate ( q ) phase is realized at low @xmath29 and @xmath16 , the double broken ( db ) phase at low @xmath29 and intermediate @xmath16 , and the @xmath2 condensate ( d ) phase at low @xmath29 and high @xmath16 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phase](b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "this feature bears resemblance to the case of the 4d njl model .",
    "it is difficult to make a direct comparison between the present model and the 4d njl model , because the free parameter in the njl model is the  direct ratio \" of the coupling constants @xmath72 , while the free parameter of the present model is the ratio @xmath44 which is not @xmath72 .",
    "however the parameter @xmath40 is related to @xmath73 through eq.([delta0 ] ) , and @xmath40 becomes larger as @xmath73 increases .",
    "then the ratio @xmath44 increases as the @xmath2 coupling constant @xmath73 increases .",
    "this means that , as @xmath72 increases , the region of the q phase shrinks , and the regions of the d phase and the db phase expand .",
    "then , the behavior of the phase diagrams shows the close similarity to the case of the 4d njl model .",
    "we are now in the position to make the comparison with the 3d gn model with the 2c quarks .",
    "comparing with the phase diagrams in the 2c quark case obtained in @xcite , we see rather similar structure : the q phase at low @xmath29 and @xmath16 , and the d phase at low @xmath29 and high @xmath16 .",
    "however , there is one crucial difference . there does not appear the db phase in the 2c quark case , while in the present 4c quark case",
    ", the db phase does appear .",
    "the latter fact is in accord with the expectation mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the critical points between the first - order and second - order transition , are located on the q @xmath71 d phase transition line in fig .",

    "it is also worth comparing the present model with the model with the 2c quarks , where the coexisting phase is absent .",
    "the phase transition q @xmath71 d is always of the first order and the critical points are seen on the line q @xmath71 n@xcite .",
    "this may come from the fact that the existence of the @xmath2 condensate expels the @xmath1 condensate . on the other hand , in the present 4c quark case",
