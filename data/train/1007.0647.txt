    "the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) exo 0748676 was discovered as a transient source with the european x - ray observatory satellite ( _ exosat _ ) in 1985 @xcite .",
    "the source exhibits simultaneous x - ray and optical eclipses from which the orbital period of p = 3.82 hr was deduced @xcite . also exhibited irregular x - ray dipping activity @xcite , and type - i x - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "burst oscillations in were first reported by @xcite at 45 hz in the average fourier power spectrum of 38 type - i x - ray bursts ; the 45-hz signal was then interpreted as the spin frequency of the neutron star .",
    "recently , @xcite detected millisecond oscillations in the rising phase of two type - i x - ray bursts in exo 0748 - 676 at a frequency of 552 hz .",
    "they concluded that the spin frequency of exo 0748 - 676 is close to 522 hz , rather than 45 hz as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the 45 hz oscillation may arise in the boundary layer between the disk and the neutron star @xcite or it could be a statistical fluctuation @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a measurement of the gravitational redshift from iron and oxygen x - ray absorption lines arising from the atmosphere of the neutron star in during type - i x - ray bursts , but subsequent observations failed to confirm these features @xcite . based on the gravitational redshift , @xcite suggested that the mass , radius and distance of are @xmath0 @xmath1 , @xmath2 km and @xmath3 kpc , respectively , which would rule out many neutron - star equations of state .    measuring the distance to lmxbs is difficult , except for the case of sources in globular clusters . a way to get",
    "the distance is using type - i x - ray bursts . the peak flux for some very bright bursts can reach the eddington luminosity at the surface of the neutron star . from a strong x - ray burst , @xcite derived a distance to of 7.7 kpc for a helium - dominated burst photosphere , and 5.9 kpc for a hydrogen - dominated burst photosphere .",
    "@xcite analyzed several type - i x - ray bursts from and estimated a distance of 7.4 kpc , different from the value of 9.2 kpc reported by @xcite .",
    "taking into account the touchdown flux and high - inclination in , recently @xcite gave a distance of 7.1 @xmath4 1.2 kpc .    another way to get the distance to an lmxb is through observations of quiescent x - ray emission from the neutron - star surface . during the quiescent state , x - ray emission originates from the atmosphere of the neutron star . by fitting the x - ray spectrum of the neutron - star system with hydrogen atmosphere models , one can estimate the mass , radius and distance of the neutron star .",
    "recently , the neutron - star x - ray transient underwent a transition into quiescence @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the distance to that we constrained from xmm - newton data .",
    "we use two different neutron - star atmophere models to fit the x - ray spectrum , and compare the results of the spectral fitting with different neutron - star equation of state ( eos ) . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the observation and data analysis .",
    "we show the fitting results in  [ results ] , and we discuss our findings in  [ discussion ] .",
    "was observed with the european photon imaging camera ( epic pn and mos ) on board the xmm - newton on 2008 november 6 at 08:30:03 utc ( obsid 0560180701 ) .",
    "the pn and the two mos cameras were operated in full - window mode .",
    "we reduced the xmm - newton observation data files ( odf ) using version 8.0.0 of the science analysis software ( sas ) .",
    "we used the epproc and emproc tasks to extract the event files for the pn and the two mos cameras , respectively .",
    "source light curves and spectra were extracted in the 0.2 @xmath5 12.0 kev band using a circular extraction region with a radius of 30 arcsec centered on the position of the source .",
    "background light curves and spectra were extracted from a circular source - free region of 35 arcsec source - free on the same ccd .",
    "we applied standard filtering and examined the light curves for background flares .",
    "no flares were present and we used the whole exposure for our analysis .",
    "the exposure time for the pn camera was 24.2 ks , and for each mos camera was 29.03 ks .",
    "the source count rate was @xmath6 cts / s for pn , and @xmath7 cts / s and @xmath8 cts / s for mos1 and mos2 , respectively .",
    "we checked the filtered event files for photon pile - up by running the task epatplot .",
    "no pile - up was apparent in the pn , mos1 and mos2 data .",
    "the photon redistribution matrices and ancillary files for the source spectra were created using the sas tools rmfgen and arfgen , respectively .",
    "we rebinned the source spectra using the tool pharbn , such that the number of bins per resolution element of the pn and mos spectra was 3 and the minimum number of counts per channel was 20 .",
    "we fitted the pn and mos spectra simultaneously in the 0.5@xmath510.0 kev range with xspec 12.50 @xcite , using either of two neutron - star hydrogen - atmosphere models : nsagrav @xcite and nsatmos @xcite .",
    "the nsagrav model provides the spectra emitted from a nonmagnetic hydrogen atmosphere of a neutron star with surface gravitational acceleration , @xmath9 , ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11 cm s@xmath12 .",
    "this model uses the mass ( @xmath13 ) and radius ( @xmath14 ) of the neutron star and the unredshifted effective temperature of the surface of the star ( @xmath15 ) as parameters .",
    "the normalization of the model is defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the distance to the source in pc .",
    "the second model that we used , nsatmos , includes a range of surface gravities and effective temperatures , and incorporates thermal electron conduction and self - irradiation by photons from the compact object .",
    "this model assumes negligible magnetic fields ( less than @xmath18 g ) and a pure hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "nsatmos parameters are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , log@xmath19 ( the same as for nsagrav ) , distance in kpc , and a separate normalization @xmath20 , which corresponds to the fraction of the neutron - star surface that is emitting .",
    "we fixed @xmath20 to be 1 in all our fits with nsatmos .     10.0 kev energy band .",
    "the spectrum was fitted with a neutron - star hydrogen atmosphere model ( nsatmos ) and a power - law model with @xmath21 fixed to 1 .",
    "the lower panel shows the residuals to the best - fit model .",
    ", width=245 ]    we included the effect of interstellar absorption using phabs assuming cross - sections of @xcite and solar abundances from @xcite , and we let @xmath22 , column density along the line of sight free to vary during the fitting . in order to account for differences in effective area between the different cameras",
    ", we introduced a multiplicative factor in our model .",
    "first , this factor was fixed to unity for pn and free for mos1 and mos2 .",
    "then , we set the scaling factor to unity for mos1 and mos2 , respectively , and set the factor free for the other cameras .",
    "we found that , fixing the scaling factor for different cameras gives similar best - fit results .",
    "therefore in the rest of the paper we fixed the factor to be 1 for pn and free to vary for the other cameras .",
    "none of the atmosphere models alone fitted the spectrum above @xmath23 kev properly . adding",
    "a power - law component improved the fits significantly , however , all parameters were less constrained than when fitting the data with the neutron - star atmosphere model only .",
    "we first fixed the power - law index to 0.5 , 1.0 and 1.5 to get better constraints on the parameters of the neutron - star atmosphere model ( degenaar et al .",
    "further , we initially fixed the distance to the ns at 7.1 kpc , which is the value inferred from the touchdown flux of @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note .",
    "the 90% and 99% confidence levels upper limit for the two ns atmosphere models nsagrav and nsatmos for the eos models : ` ap3 ' , ` ms1 ' and sqm1. the distance is in kpc .",
    "we analyzed an xmm - newton observation of the neutron star in the quiescent state .",
    "the unabsorbed x - ray flux in the 0.5@xmath510.0 kev energy band was @xmath24 10@xmath25 ergs cm@xmath12 s@xmath27 .",
    "we found that the non - thermal ( power - law ) component only contributes @xmath28 of the 0.5@xmath510 kev x - ray flux , which is lower than what @xcite found from _",
    "chandra _ data ( @xmath29 was @xmath30 16@xmath517@xmath31 of the 0.5@xmath510 kev x - ray flux from the fit with @xmath32 ) about a month earlier than our observation . the total unabsorbed flux ( 0.5@xmath510.0 kev )",
    "decreased from @xmath33 ergs cm@xmath12 s@xmath27 in the _ chandra _ observation to @xmath34 ergs cm@xmath12 s@xmath27 in our observation , whereas @xmath22 changed from @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 to @xmath38 @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "the effective temperature , however , did not show large variations in one month time . according to the above comparisons , the reduction of the total flux is due to a lower contribution of the power - law component .    because the x - ray spectrum in the quiescent state is dominated by thermal emission originating from the ns surface ,",
    "our data allow us to constrain the mass and radius of the neutron star .",
    "from the two different ns atmosphere models ( nsagrav and nsatmos ) that we used to fit the x - ray spectrum , we found that both models show similar results and set good constraints on the neutron - star radius . even taking into account the @xmath13 lower limit ( from * ? ? ? * ) , upper limit ( from * ? ? ? * ) and our best fit @xmath39 contour , we still have a large area on the mass - radius diagram , and many eoss are still possible ( see figure [ fig : contour_sum ] ) . in order to constrain the allowed space of mass and radius at a specified distance",
    ", we choose three typical neutron - star eos , ` ap3 ' , ` ms1 ' and sqm1. we found that the smaller the distance to the ns the more eoss are consistent with the data .    for any specific eos , as the upper limit of the distance we took the value of the distance where the 99% confidence contour just intersects the curve of that eos .",
    "we found that the upper limits on the distance as derived from the nsagrav model are slightly higher than those for the nsatmos model . the eos model ` ms1 ' can be just satisfied at a distance of 7.1 kpc .",
    "if we assume that the neutron star in is a normal neutron star , following the eos ` ap3 ' , the source should be closer than 8.9 kpc for the nsagrav model , or 8.5 kpc for the nsatmos model .",
    "both the ms1 and ap3 eos are fully consistent with the measured distance of 7.1 kpc @xcite . for larger distances more",
    "eos are ruled out .",
    "the eos sqm1 is rejected by the atmosphere model fits for a distance of 7.1 kpc measured from the x - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "we note , however , the neutron - star atmosphere models may not appropriate for bare quark matter stars , but only for those normal quark star where a crust is present .",
