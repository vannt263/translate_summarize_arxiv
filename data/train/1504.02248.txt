    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , as the fundamental theory of strong interactions , gains an increasing number of applications in particle physics .",
    "perturbative qcd calculations ( lattice qcd ) methods work well for small distances or high energies",
    ". however , the analytical as well as the numerical methods have not been developed enough on the scale of large distances or low energies due to its essential non - perturbative features of hidden ( spontaneously broken ) chiral symmetry and confinement , especially if the baryons are involved @xcite .",
    "therefore , effective quark models which have the certain essential features of qcd are other important choices @xcite .",
    "the chiral soliton model which is also called the linear sigma model ( l@xmath0 m ) @xcite , as one of effective models , incorporates the chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking @xcite .",
    "the model which has been proposed as a model for strong nuclear interactions provides a good description of the nuclear properties .",
    "the chiral soliton model could be solved in the mean - field approximation .",
    "a semiclassical soliton solution is referred to a baryon , and the baryon properties can be derived easily from the soliton solution @xcite .    in recent years ,",
    "studies on the behavior of strongly interacting mater under extreme conditions which is created by relativistic heavy ion collision are more and more interesting .",
    "the hadron properties ( masses , radius , magnetic moments , etc . ) in a hot and dense medium have drawn a lot of attentions @xcite .",
    "the hadron properties reflect the non - perturbative features of qcd . at zero temperature , there are sufficient studies on the hadron properties , especially the hadron mass , within effective models . at finite temperature , the quarks ( and thus hadrons )",
    "are expected to become lighter with chiral symmetry getting restored in the famous brown - rho paper @xcite .",
    "this meets quite many papers , such as references @xcite . however , there are also many papers which obtain that the hadron mass increase with the temperature increasing @xcite .",
    "the chiral soliton model successfully predicts the static nucleon properties at zero temperature and density @xcite .",
    "the nucleon properties has also been studied through the same model at finite temperatures and densities @xcite .",
    "the effective masses have been obtained by these solitons . in these studies , however , the thermal medium contribution to the soliton energy is not properly treated . in reference",
    "@xcite , the energy of the thermal medium is completely neglected , but under this treatment the baryon mass could not go back to the right result of the baryon mass at zero temperature and density . in references",
    "@xcite , the thermal medium contribution is not well subtracted which results in unphysical rising of a baryon mass at high temperatures .",
    "our goal in this paper is to give a well defined baryon mass calculation in a thermal medium within the soliton model .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , the chiral soliton model is introduced at zero as well as finite temperature and density . in section [ sec : mass ] , the baryon mass calculation in medium through chiral soliton model is discussed . in section [ sec : results ] , we present the thermal effective potential density , and show the soliton solutions of the chiral soliton equations at different temperatures and densities . then the numerical results are discussed before the summary section .",

    "first , we derive the thermal effective potential of the spatially uniform system at finite temperature and density using the finite temperature field theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 is used to guarantee that the absolute minimum value of the thermal effective potential is zero , and it is the key of strictly calculating the baryon mass , which will be discussed later . the thermodynamical potential which is distributed by the homogeneous medium is @xmath27 + \\ln [ 1 + e^{-(e_q + \\mu)/t } ] \\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the degeneracy factor @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the valence quark and antiquark energy for @xmath31,@xmath32 quarks .",
