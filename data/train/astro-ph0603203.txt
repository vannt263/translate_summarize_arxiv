    "the earliest stages of low - mass ( 0.22m@xmath3 ) star formation are becoming reasonably well understood ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) . the prestellar core stage @xcite is the phase in which a molecular cloud core has become gravitationally bound .",
    "thereafter gravitational collapse sets in and a central hydrostatic protostar forms , which is known as a class 0 protostar @xcite .",
    "once half of the final mass has accreted onto the central object it is known as a class i protostar @xcite , and it subsequently evolves through the class ii & iii young stellar object ( yso ) phases @xcite .",
    "debate continues over the details of this evolutionary process , and different molecular clouds appear to be evolving according to a different interplay of physical mechanisms .",
    "these include magnetic fields , turbulence and feedback from previous episodes of star formation .",
    "submillimetre studies of different star - forming regions are required to help clarify the evolutionary process and determine the effect of these mechanisms .",
    "the l1689 molecular cloud is part of the @xmath0  ophiuchi molecular cloud complex , which is located at a distance of 128 @xmath4 12 pc from the sun .",
    "it was first detected by @xcite in a large study of the dark nebulae detected in the palomar observatory sky survey plates .",
    "the @xmath0  ophiuchi complex was extensively mapped by @xcite using @xmath1co at a resolution of 2.4 arcmin .",
    "the resulting map of the cloud is shown in fig .",
    "[ loren ] .",
    "the data show that the molecular cloud is composed of a number of sub - clouds , the most massive of which is l1688 .            [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      @xcite mapped the densest parts of the l1688 cloud using the scuba camera on the jcmt . together with the data presented here , these make an ideal dataset to compare the current star - formation activity of the two clouds .",
    "@xcite smoothed their map of l1688 by twice the largest chop throw ( 130 arcsec ) , and subtracted this from the map .",
    "this was done in order to remove all large scale structure , some of which could result from residual atmospheric noise or incorrectly fitted baselines in the data reduction process .    for the purposes of directly comparing the two datasets , we carried out the same step , and subtracted the large scale structure .",
    "in the following analysis , all the core masses are calculated assuming a distance to the region of 130  pc , and a dust temperature of 20  k. again , this is to allow a direct comparison of the two data - sets .",
    "the sensitivities of the two surveys are not significantly different .",
    "the scuba map of l1688 has a @xmath5 sensitivity of approximately 10 mjy / beam @xcite , compared to our map of l1689 , which has a @xmath5 sensitivity of 15  30 mjy / beam ( see table  [ noise_levels ] ) .",
    "the scuba map of l1689 presented here covers most of the @xmath1co regions named by @xcite between r53 and r65 ( see table [ table_comparisons ] and figure [ l1689_regions ] ) .",
    "the area covered by the scuba map of l1688 is approximately coincident with r22 .",
    "the scuba map also covers the portion of r25 that is coincident with @xmath0-oph  f ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "though this region was not completely mapped by @xcite , a wider area survey of @xmath0 ophiuchus @xcite has indicated that there is very little star - formation activity in r25 except that contained in @xmath0-oph  f.    the scuba map of l1688 does not include the @xmath0-oph  d core in r26 , therefore data obtained using the iram 30 m telescope were used to extend the following analysis to this region . separated the iram data into large and small scale structure using a wavelet analysis .",
    "we use the core masses for their small scale ` clumps ' ( see their table 2 ) , which , like the @xcite data , have effectively had the larger scale structure removed . for consistency with the other data - sets",
    ", we also scale the r26 core masses to a temperature of 20  k and a distance of 130  pc .",
    "table  [ table_comparisons ] gives the mass of each cloud region , measured from the @xmath1co emission @xcite .",
    "the total mass of prestellar and starless cores within each region ( @xmath6 ) is given in column  4 .",
    "this is calculated from the submillimetre dust emission from the cores in l1688 and l1689 .",
    "the cores that contain protostellar sources have not been included in these values .",
    "this is so we can evaluate and compare the potential yield of the next generation of star formation in the two clouds .",
    "table  [ table_comparisons ] shows that the current star - formation activity is highly variable across both clouds .",
    "r22 has the largest mass of dense cores , with 16 m@xmath3 compared to @xmath7 m@xmath3 in each of the regions of l1689 .",
    "this may be reasonably expected , as the r22 region is significantly more massive than the other regions . in order to compare the fraction of the mass in dense cores in the different regions directly ,",
    "we divide the mass in cores by the mass of the region , measured from @xmath1co maps @xcite .",
    "this is given for each region in column  5 of table  [ table_comparisons ] .",
    "when the two clouds ( l1688 and l1689 ) are considered as a whole , l1688 has a much higher fraction ( by a factor of 2 ) of its mass contained in dense cores , with a value of @xmath8 of 0.018 , compared to 0.010 for l1689 .",
    "even if we ignore the regions of l1689 that contain no submillimetre cores , and only consider r53 , r55 , r57 & r65 , the total prestellar core mass ratio for l1689 only rises to 0.012 .",
    "this is still only two - thirds of the value seen in l1688 .",
    "this indicates that l1688 will probably have a higher star formation efficiency in the next generation of star formation",
    ".    however , the values of @xmath8 for the most active regions of the two clouds ( i.e. r22 in l1688 and r53 & r55 , which make up filament 1 in l1689 ) are in fact similar ( although the absolute masses are much smaller in r53 and r55 ) .",
    "this could be indicating that parts of l1689 may not be as infertile as was previously thought .",
    "we note that these three regions are located at the western edges of l1688 and l1689 .",
    "we consider the significance of this in the following section .",
    "we finally note that the fraction of prestellar material in @xmath0-oph  a ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is an order of magnitude higher than in the rest of r22 . to calculate this",
    ", we compared the mass of compact submillimetre condensations in @xmath0-oph  a @xcite with the mass measured using c@xmath9o ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* their table 2 and fig .  4 ) .",
    "to summarise this section , we have found that on average , the l1688 cloud has a much higher fraction of its mass in dense cores than l1689 .",
    "the western edges of both l1688 ( r22 ) and l1689 ( filament 1 ) have comparable fractions .",
    "@xmath0-oph  a is significantly more efficient at converting its mass into dense cores than any other component of the molecular cloud , and it appears likely that the existing young star cluster will continue to grow in richness .",
    "the regions to the east of both clouds have a much lower mass fraction in dense cores .",
    "one possible explanation for the picture painted in the previous section is that the star formation in both of the clouds is being affected by an external influence , such as the by - products of nearby young massive stars .",
    "this scenario is known as sequential or triggered star formation , and was first suggested by @xcite .    in this picture , the stars which have already formed , interact with the molecular cloud , triggering further star formation , which propagates through the cloud .",
    "this scenario has previously been used to explain the star formation in @xmath0  oph ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", we believe that the star formation in both l1688 and l1689 is being influenced by members of the upper scorpius ob association .    the most massive and luminous nearby component of the upper scorpius ob association is @xmath2  sco .",
    "this is a hierarchical multiple containing an o9v star and a b2iii star and at least two other b stars .",
    "sco lies at a distance of 100 arcmin from l1688 ( projected distance 4  pc ) , and 150 arcmin from l1689 ( projected distance 6  pc ) .",
    "it appears to be a prime candidate for the triggering mechanism in both of these clouds .",
    "this hypothesis is consistent with the observation that the majority of the star formation in both clouds is occurring primarily in regions r22 , r53 & r55 , which make up parallel filaments at the edge of each cloud closest to @xmath2  sco .",
    "these filaments are perpendicular to the line of sight joining each cloud and @xmath2  sco . in addition",
    ", the extensions of both l1688 and l1689 to the north - east lie on a line directly away from @xmath2  sco @xcite . in this hypothesis ,",
    "the eastern regions of the two clouds are shielded from the triggering source by the two filaments .",
    "we note that r57 is unusual in that it is located on the western edge of l1689 , yet has a very small value of @xmath8 .",
    "however , r57 has recently formed the protostellar sources smm 19 & 20 , and if the mass associated with these sources is included , then the fertility of r57 becomes comparable with the regions of filament 1 .",
    "the influence of @xmath2  sco has clearly had a different effect on the two clouds , as is evidenced by the young proto - cluster that has formed in l1688 , and the lack of such a cluster in l1689 .",
    "we hypothesise that this difference in star - formation activity in the two clouds is simply due to the fact that l1688 is closer to @xmath2  sco .",
    "hence it suffers a greater effect according to the square of the distance difference .",
    "the sequential star formation in this region can be traced back a number of generations . the upper scorpius ob association is adjacent to an older ob association called upper centaurus - lupus .",
    "@xcite suggest that the massive stars in upper centaurus - lupus triggered the star formation in upper scorpius , just as upper scorpius is triggering star formation in @xmath0  oph .",
    "it appears though that this is the end of the line for sequential star formation , as the only massive star to have formed in l1688 or l1689 is the young b3 star s1 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that this star will have the energy required to propagate the star formation as effectively through the remainder of the @xmath0  ophiuchi cloud in the same way .",
    "we have mapped the l1689 cloud at submillimetre wavelengths , and detected a number of cores and protostellar envelopes , some of which are reported here for the first time .",
    "we have detected filaments in the submillimetre continuum that are also seen in the @xmath1co observations of the cloud .",
    "all of the detected star - formation activity in l1689 is contained within these filaments , the majority being in filament  1 .",
    "we have compared the potential future rate of star formation of l1689 with that of l1688 by looking at the fraction of mass of each cloud that is currently in starless and prestellar cores .",
    "we find that when normalised to the total mass of each cloud , the l1688 cloud has on average a much higher percentage of mass in cores .",
    "this is consistent with the higher star - formation activity observed in l1688 .",
    "we deduce that l1688 and l1689 are both examples of triggered star formation caused by @xmath2  sco and the reason that the l1689 dog has not barked is that it is less massive than l1688 and is further away from @xmath2  sco .",
