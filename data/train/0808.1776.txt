    "the study of spectroscopy and the decay properties of the heavy flavour mesonic states provides us useful information about the dynamics of quarks and gluons at the hadronic scale . the remarkable progress at the experimental side , with various high energy machines such as lhc , b - factories , tevatron , argus collaborations , cleo etc for the study of hadrons has opened up new challenges in the theoretical understanding of heavy flavour hadrons . in order to understand the structure of the newly observed zoo of open flavour meson resonances@xcite in the energy range of 2 - 5 @xmath3 , it is necessary to analyze their spectroscopic properties and decay modes based on theoretical models . many of these states could be the excited charmed mesonic states while for many other states the possibility of multi - quark or molecular like structures are being proposed .",
