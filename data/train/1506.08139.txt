    "fast transverse instability of proton beam in the fermilab recycler has been observed and reported recently @xcite .",
    "convincing arguments are adduced that the instability is caused by electron clouds .",
    "however , a detailed theoretical analysis is not performed in the quoted work .",
    "development of theoretical model which is capable to explain these data in a consistent way is the aim of this note .",
    "transverse cross sections of e - cloud in the recycler are represented in fig .",
    "a1 of the appendix .",
    "the figures are copied from ref .",
    "@xcite where they have been obtained by computer simulation with posinst code @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion follows from these pictures that the e - cloud density almost does not depend on vertical coordinate @xmath0 , especially inside the proton beam which is sketched as the red circle .",
    "this feature of e - cloud in strong magnetic field is confirmed in other papers ( see e.g. @xcite ) and is in a consent with following simple explanation",
    ".    transverse motion of electrons inside a proton bunch in the presence of vertical magnetic field @xmath1 is described by the equations @xmath2 with the coefficients @xmath3 the simplest model of proton beam as a rod of constant density @xmath4 centered in the point @xmath5 is used here .",
    "however , it will be shown soon that it is an assumption of a little importance .",
    "the proton beam in the recycler can oscillate with betatron frequency @xmath6 .",
    "therefore relations of amplitudes following from eq .",
    "( 1 ) are @xmath7 the parameters taken for the following numerical estimations are : @xmath8 .",
    "angular velocity of protons in the recycler can be used as a convenient unit : @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "because the proton beam tune is @xmath12 , the amplitude ratios are : @xmath13 it means that the movement of electrons is awfully obstructed in horizontal direction due to magnetic field . as for vertical direction , each electron follows the protons bunch when it is located inside it , and moves `` free '' between the bunches .",
    "in such a manner it can reach the pipe walls where it can drive out secondary electrons which can be trapped by next bunch , etc . as a result , each primary electron creates a vertical e - stream composed of secondary electrons .",
    "the stream density depends on time but it keeps a fixed position in @xmath14-@xmath15 plane coinciding with position of the proton which was begetting the primary electron .",
    "a host of the streams forms a stationary e - cloud which transverse cross - section is presented in fig .",
    "the cloud top view is sketched in fig .  1 where several proton bunches are shown , each oscillating horizontally due to injection errors .",
    "the bunches create snake - like immovable e - traces as they are drafted in the picture .",
    "the traces of several bunches coincide if they have been injected with the same errors , or differ from each other if the errors differ ( bunch # 2 in fig .  1 ) .",
    "according to the model , electron density at distance @xmath16 from the cloud beginning can be represented in the form        @xmath17    where @xmath18 is steady state ( w / o coherent oscillations ) projection of proton beam on axis @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the beam coherent displacement , and @xmath21 is its linear density .",
    "the coefficient @xmath22 describes evolution of each snake local density which appears , increases in a time due to secondary electrons , and decays eventually because the e - oscillations are typically unstable as they are focused by field of bunched proton beam .",
    "calculation of this function is not a subject of this paper , and it will be treated further as some phenomenological parameters .",
    "horizontal electric field of the cloud looks like eq .  ( 5 ) @xmath23 if the beam consists of short identical bunches , the integral turns into the sum @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the time separation of the bunches which are enumerated from the beam head ( index 0 ) to the current bunch ( index @xmath26 ) .",
    "therefore equation of horizontal oscillations of a proton in @xmath27 bunch is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is betatron frequency without e - cloud .",
    "it gives for small oscillations : @xmath30\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is averaged over @xmath33 e - cloud density in @xmath34 bunch .",
    "therefore average incoherent betatron frequency is in @xmath35 bunch : @xmath36 thus the coefficient @xmath37 has to be treated as the betatron frequency shift created by a bunch # @xmath38 in the bunch # @xmath26 .",
    "it is clear that this single - bunch wake has a restricted length which effectively can be taken as @xmath39 .",
    "then @xmath40 is the saturated tune shift which could be created by rather long batch and measured experimentally ( @xmath41 is the average value ) .",
    "small betatron oscillations are considered in this section .",
    "averaging eq .",
    "( 9 ) over each bunch , one can obtain equations of motion of the bunch centers : @xmath42 ,   \\qquad n=0,\\,1,\\,\\dots\\ ] ] looking general solution in the form @xmath43\\big)+{\\rm c.c . }",

    "it means that all bunches are injected at the same conditions and move on the same trajectory , as it is shown in fig .  1 by solid lines",
    ". field on axis of this e - cloud is zero so it does not affect motion of the bunch centers .",
    "it follows from this that some spread of the injection conditions is one of the prerequisites of the e - cloud instability .",
    "it should be emphasized in this connection that coherent eigentunes of the bunches coincide with their incoherent tunes ( if the bunch coherent interaction is excluded ) .",
    "it is apparent that the mutual influence of bunches is stronger when their eigentunes are closer .",
    "therefore an approach of the eigentunes is another prerequisite of the instability .",
    "2 is represented for an explanation of these statements .",
    "a possible wake function of a single bunch is sketched separately in upper part of the picture .",
    "it arises inside the bunch , remains constant for a time , and quickly decays after this .",
    "the figure itself represents corresponding e - cloud of a long batch .",
    "the density ( and the tune shifts ) increase in the beginning of the batch ( 5 bunches in the example ) , and remains constant hereafter .",
    "the red line is added to sketch expected behavior of coherent amplitudes . rather disorderly moving in the beginning of the batch changes into a systematic growth later .",
    "it is taken into account also that the growth can not be unrestricted , in particular because of nonlinear effects which are beyond of presented approximation and will be considered in following section .",
    "this pattern has to be compared with results of e - cloud simulation presented in fig .",
    "a2 . even though the simulated shape of the e - cloud is more complicated , the model reflects its important properties : fast growth in the beginning and saturation at the end ( partial decay and oscillations between the bunches seem to be less important for the bunch centers ) .",
    "( both real and imaginary parts).,width=377 ]    the case @xmath46 is considered in this subsection as a preliminary step .",
    "it means that the wake of any bunch does not decay , at least in the range of considered part of the batch .",

    "this result affirms both of foregoing statements : ( i ) e - cloud does not affect coherent oscillation at stable injection conditions , ( ii ) systematic growth of the coherent amplitudes does not happen at different eigentunes of the bunches .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "3 where random distribution of initial amplitudes has been applied .",
    "an opposite case is considered in this subsection : very short wake which can reach only the nearest following bunch : @xmath52 .",
    "then eq .",

    "4 for the conditions @xmath57 that is the injection error is 0 at leading bunch , and 1 at others .",
    "another example is given by fig .  5 with random initial distribution .",
    "it looks very similarly in average though a random spread appears .    .",
    "the leading bunch @xmath58 does not oscillate having zero error of injection , but it creates a path for following bunches providing them the same eigentune .",

    "however , the amplitude growth rate is now about 3 times faster at the same @xmath83 .",
    "the main conclusions from this model are : + 1 .",
    "the `` instability '' appears because of injection errors which are amplified from bunch to bunch along the batch .",
    "however , it can not appear at absolutely stable injection conditions .",
    "some spread of the errors is necessary to turn on the bunch coherent interaction .",
    "expected bunch coupling is not very strong in the batch beginning because of essential difference of their eigentunes .",
    "non - growing bunch oscillations are possible in this part . the amplitudes coincide with injection errors in order of value , having an interference if the errors are varied .",
    "duration of this part is about saturation time of the cloud .",
    "systematic growth of the amplitudes can happen in more remote parts of the batch where the e - cloud is saturated .",
    "the amplitude growth rate increases from the batch beginning to its tail being almost exponential at the end .",
    "these statements are partially confirmed by experimental data presented in fig .",
    "a3 . very small and about constant amplitudes",
    "are observed in the front part of the batch including about 20 bunches .",
    "then the amplitudes demonstrate a growth by factor 2 - 3 in following 20 - 30 bunches .",
    "these data do not conflict to the model with @xmath84 .",
    "however , the bunches with @xmath85 have about equal amplitudes whereas the model predicts their unrestricted growth . similar contradiction ( saturation against unrestricted growth ) concerns the long term effects that is the dependence of the amplitudes on revolution number .",
