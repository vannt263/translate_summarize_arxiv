    "[ structure ] .",
    "the finding that h vibrations provide the mechanism seems to confirm the suggestion of ashcroft that dense hydrogen should superconduct at high temperature,@xcite however evidence is increasing that h - rich materials@xcite are substantially different and more promising than pure hydrogen until tpa pressures can be reached .",
    "early quantitative estimates@xcite of t@xmath0 for metallic h were in the 250k range ; more recent values@xcite in the range of several tpa lie in the 500 - 750k range .",
    "the phase diagram of this system is uncertain , however , due to the quantum nature of the proton .",
    "nearest neighbor s - h bonds are shown . at this nearest neighbor level ,",
    "the structure consists of two interleaved reo@xmath2 sublattices , displaced relative to one another by the body - centering vector ( 1,1,1)@xmath3/2 . ]",

    "other basic questions have yet to be addressed .",
    "first , why are the electron - phonon matrix elements as large as they are ?",
    "it is true that the main causative property behind the high t@xmath0 is the ( understandably ) high phonon frequencies that set the energy scale for t@xmath0 , but substantial electron - ion matrix elements are also required .",

    "this question posed by intricacies in the density of states ( dos ) and the role of zero point vibrations has stimulated work by bianconi and jarlborg.@xcite    more fundamentally there is the question",
    " why h@xmath2s ? why sulfur ? \"",
    "several h - rich materials have been studied at high pressure ( see references in refs . [ ] and bernstein _",

    "papaconstantopoulos and collaborators@xcite calculated the pressure dependence of matrix elements , finding increasing h scattering with increasing pressure .",
    "more basically one can ask , is there something special about sulfur , and the underlying electronic structure , that provides the platform for such high t@xmath0 ?    it is the last of these questions we address initially in this paper .",
    "an obvious feature for study is the strikingly sharp peak in the density of states @xmath7 due to two van hove singularities ( vhs ) separated by 300 mev very near the fermi level @xmath8 .",
    "there is a large literature on the connection between peaks in @xmath7 and high t@xmath0 in the a15 class of materials@xcite and later in the high temperature superconducting cuprates,@xcite but their importance for h@xmath2s is unclear .",
    "van hove singularities near the fermi level can enhance n(@xmath8 ) and thus the epc strength @xmath5 due to increased number of available states to participate , but there are additional questions to address .",

    "et al._@xcite have discussed the various challenges in reaching convergence , before even confronting the energy variation question .",
    "the ( unsmeared ) prediction of t@xmath0@xmath107 200 k indicates that improved theory , by taking into account phonon broadening , would give a substantially reduced critical temperature .",

    "their methods also involve calculation of @xmath91 that is not treated in the eliashberg form as well as other methodological differences , and these differences make direct comparison with other reports difficult . still , the relative effects of energy variation of n(e ) are clear .",

    "the phonon self - energy involves electron - phonon scattering in which a phonon is absorbed , scattering an electron from e@xmath108 e@xmath17 to e@xmath109 e@xmath17 .",
    "most methods of calculating phonon frequencies do not include effects of the density of available initial or final states in this energy region being variable .",
    "thus calculation of phonon spectra will need to be re - evaluated for situations such as that imposed by h@xmath2s , and the associated non - adiabatic corrections considered .",
    "the foregoing section indicates that 200 k superconductivity has been achieved with an effective dos around @xmath110 0.44/ev - f.u .",
    "compared to a peak value between the two vhs around 0.7/ev - f.u .",
    "this means as mentioned above that the theory needs refining , as already noted by flores - livas _ et al .",
    "_ , to determine just how much is understood quantitatively and what features may require more attention .",
    "this difference in n(e ) versus @xmath111(e ) has larger and much more positive implications .",
    "the fact that a reduced effective value of @xmath112 should be used for h@xmath2s also provides the glass - half - full viewpoint : a much larger value of @xmath112 and therefore t@xmath0 may be achievable in this or similar systems .",
    "suppose that the two vhs can be moved apart , each by ( say ) 0.5 ev , leaving a value n(e@xmath113 @xmath1070.7/ev - f.u . between .",
    "then the lorentzian smearing will have much less effect .",
    "there is also the question of increasing the _ magnitude _ of n(e ) at the peak , _",
    "i.e. _ n(e@xmath114 .",
    "this value depends on the effective masses at the vhs , but also on the volume of the region in which the quadratic effective mass representation holds .",

    "the value n(e@xmath114 at the vhs is proportional to the thermal mass and to the radius @xmath119 of the region of quadratic dispersion , and the decrease away from the vhs ( the second term ) is inversely proportional to @xmath119",
    ". there will be additional smooth contributions from outside this region , of course .",
    "however , increasing @xmath54 and the region of quadratic dispersion is favorable for increasing @xmath84 in the vhs region , and hence increasing t@xmath0 .",
    "these observations seems to implicate the _ topology _ of the fermi surfaces , rather than more conventional electronic structure characteristics such as relative site energies and hybridization strengths .",
    "numerical examples are illuminating .",
    "suppose that the dos peak can be widened so that @xmath110 n(e@xmath17 ) = 0.70/ev - f.u . as outlined just above , rather than the reduced effective value of 0.45ev / f.u .",
    "that gives , experimentally , t@xmath0=200k . with @xmath120 1300 k and @xmath91=0.15 as above",
    ", @xmath121=2.17 is required to account for t@xmath0 = 200k . for a 0.70/0.44 = 1.55 larger value of n(e@xmath17 ) , @xmath5=3.38 and we find t@xmath0=277k  room temperature in a cool room .",
    "the increase in effective @xmath112 we have assumed is ambitious but not outlandish , given the calculated spectrum of @xmath1 h@xmath2s .",
    "it is clearly worthwhile to explore other h - rich compounds for higher critical temperatures .",
    "of course , the increase in @xmath112 will give additional renormalization ( softening ) of the phonons .",
    "however , the modes are very stiff even with @xmath5=2.1 , so this may not be a major effect .",
    "note that decreasing @xmath58 increases @xmath5 but decreases the energy scale prefactor in t@xmath0 , one reason why increasing @xmath5 by decreasing frequencies is rarely a profitable means of increasing t@xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath58 , the prefactor in the allen - dynes t@xmath0 equation , is softened by 10% without change in matrix elements , @xmath5 increases by 20% while t@xmath0 increases by only 4% .",
    "evidently softening of hard phonons is a minor issue when looking for higher t@xmath0 in this range of @xmath5 .",
    "this behavior was formalized by allen and dynes,@xcite who obtained the rigorous strong coupling limit @xmath122 where @xmath70 is expressed in kelvins .",
    "the last expression is strictly true only for an elemental superconductor , think of the electron - ion matrix element @xmath123 and mass @xmath64 as those of h for h@xmath2s .",
    "in this paper we first addressed the electronic structure and especially the delicate van hove singularity induced spectrum , bonding characteristics and effect of s , and the charge density of states near the fermi level , more directly than has been done before .",
    "the occurrence of two closely spaced van hove singularities is definitely a central issue for the properties of h@xmath2s .",
    "we list some of the main points .",
    "@xmath124 at the most basic level , why is h@xmath2s superconducting at 200 k ? it is because both @xmath5 is large but , more importantly , the characteristic phonon frequency @xmath58 is very high .",
    "this reminds one of the allen - dynes limit for strong coupling , @xmath125 though not yet in this limit , this provides the right picture ",
    "one can check that keeping all fixed except for @xmath58 and then varying it , the change in t@xmath0 is minor because the change in prefactor @xmath126 is compensated by @xmath127    @xmath124 sulfur @xmath16 states hybridizing with hydrogen @xmath15 is crucial in producing the strong large scale structure in n(e ) within @xmath465 ev of the fermi level , and in leaving e@xmath17 at the top of a peculiarly sharp peak between two vhs .",
    "the van hove points on the constant energy surfaces that define the peak in n(e ) were identified , finding they lie on opposite ends of a line of fermi surface `` ripping apart '' with energy varying between the two van hove singularities .",
    "this region of very low velocity electrons affects a significant fraction of the zone .",
    "it is unclear how replacing s with other elements will affect the electronic structure near e@xmath17 , but small changes may have large effects .",
    "et al . _ have noted that alloying 7 - 10% of p with s moves @xmath8 to the peak in n(e ) , within the virtual crystal approximation which does not account for alloy disorder broadening . in any case , strong coupling smearing as discussed here will nullify this apparent gain .",
    "@xmath124 the fine structure and energy variation of @xmath7 near the fermi level must be taken into account to obtain quantitative results for @xmath128 , @xmath5 , and t@xmath0 .",
    "the energy dependence of n(e ) may even affect calculation of phonon frequencies , though this is untested so far .",
    "@xmath124 the closely spaced van hove singularities very near the fermi level have been shown to have significance , both on the detailed theory of h@xmath2s but , as importantly , on the question of whether t@xmath0 can be increased in related materials .",
    "sulfur and the specific @xmath1 structure are important for high @xmath129 though other elements will need to be studied to learn more about precisely why .",
    "@xmath124 the prospect for increased t@xmath0 is affirmative  it will require only evolutionary changes of the electronic structure to achieve room temperature superconductivity , though the road to this goal requires study , and additional insight into the origins of van hove singularities may be important .",
    "increasing the vhs effective masses , or increasing the volume within which quadratic dispersion holds , will increase n(e ) at the vhs energy .",
    "structural or chemical changes that affect the electronic structure rather modestly may lead to significant increase in the effective ( broadened ) density of states at e@xmath17 .",
    "other studies have suggested that substitution of some sulfur with chemically related elements may increase t@xmath0 .",
    "altogether , the prospects of achieving increased critical temperatures are encouraging .",
