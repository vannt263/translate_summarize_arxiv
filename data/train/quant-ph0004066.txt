    "in order to gain information about a physical quantity one should , in principle , measure the corresponding quantum observable . in cases",
    "when the measurement can be directly implemented the statistics of the outcomes is governed ( in ideal conditions , i.e. neglecting thermal , mechanical or other sources of classical noise ) only by the intrinsic fluctuations of the observable , namely by the quantum nature of the system under investigation . in practice , however , it is most likely that the desired observable does not correspond to a feasible measurement scheme , or the physical quantity does not correspond to any observable at all . in such case",
    "one has to _ infer _ the value of the quantity of interest from the measurement of a different observable , or generally of a set of observables .",
    "in this situation , even in ideal conditions , the indirect parameter estimation gives an additional uncertainty for the estimated value , and the quantum estimation theory @xcite provides a general framework to optimize the inference procedure .    in the recent years , the indirect reconstruction of observables and quantum states has received much attention . among the many reconstruction techniques ,",
    "the most successful is quantum homodyne tomography @xcite , which , indeed , is the only method which has been experimentally implemented @xcite .",
    "quantum tomography provides the complete characterization of the state , i.e. the reconstruction of any quantity of interest by simple averages over experimental data . in many cases , however , one may be interested not in the complete characterization of the state , but only in some specific feature , like the phase or the amplitude of the field . moreover",
    ", one can address the problem of characterizing an optical device , rather than a quantum state , like measuring the coupling constant of an active medium or the quantum efficiency of a photodetector .",
    "in all these cases , the desired parameter does not correspond to a measurable observable , and contains only a partial information about the quantum state of light involved in the process .",
    "our goal is to link the estimation of such parameters with the results from feasible measurement schemes , as homodyne , heterodyne or direct detection , and to make the estimation procedure the most efficient .    among all possible procedures for parameter estimation , the maximum - likelihood ( ml )",
    "method is , in the sense discussed below , the most general , and widely usable in practice .",
    "the ml procedure answers to the following question : which values of the parameters are most likely to produce the results which we actually observe in the measurement  ?",
    "this statement can be quantified , and the resulting procedure is the ml estimation of the parameters .",
    "recently , the ml principle has been applied to the reconstruction of the whole state of a generic quantum system @xcite . in that case",
    "the parameters of interest are the matrix elements of the density operator in a suitable representation .",
    "bayesian and ml approaches have been also applied in neutron interferometry @xcite .    in this paper , we focus our attention on the determination of specific parameters which are relevant in quantum optics , and analyze their ml estimation procedure in some details .    in the next section",
    "we briefly review the ml estimation procedure as well as the method to evaluate its precision . in section [ s : gauss ]",
    "we consider the estimation of the parameters of a gaussian state and of the coupling constants of a generic quadratic single - mode hamiltonian .",
    "as we will show , the two estimation problems are closely related , and ml principle leads to a fully general solution . in section [ s : phase ] we study different schemes of phase estimation , whereas in section [ s : eta ] the ml principle is applied to the estimation of the quantum efficiency of both linear and avalanche photodetectors .",
    "section [ s : outro ] closes the paper by summarizing our results .",
    "here we briefly review the theory of the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) estimation of a single parameter .",
    "the generalization to several parameters is straightforward .",
    "let @xmath0 the probability density of a random variable @xmath1 , conditioned to the value of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the form of @xmath3 is known , but the true value of the parameter @xmath2 is unknown , and will be estimated from the result of a measurement of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a random sample of size @xmath5 .",
    "the joint probability density of the independent random variable @xmath4 ( the global probability of the sample ) is given by @xmath6 and is called the likelihood function of the given data sample ( hereafter we will suppress the dependence of @xmath7 on the data ) .",
    "the maximum - likelihood estimator @xmath8 ( mle ) of the parameter @xmath2 maximizes @xmath9 for variations of @xmath2 , namely it is given by the solution of the equations @xmath10 since the likelihood function is positive the first equation is equivalent to @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the so - called log - likelihood function .",
    "the form of the ml principle in eq .",
    "( [ loglikdef ] ) is the most often used in practice .",
    "the importance of mle stems from the following theorems @xcite    1 .",
    "maximum - likelihood estimators are consistent , i.e. they converge in probability to the true value of the parameter for increasing size of the data sample .",
    "2 .   the distribution of mles tends to the normal distribution in the limit of large samples , and mles have minimum variance . for finite samples",
    "the variance is governed by the cramr - rao bound ( see below ) .",
    "there are also situations in which the mle gives a poor estimation for a parameter .",
    "however , for the distributions considered here the ml procedure is statistically efficient .    in order to obtain a measure for the confidence interval in the determination of @xmath13 we consider the variance @xmath14   \\left[\\lambda_{\\sc ml }   ( \\{x_k\\})- \\lambda \\right]^2 \\ : \\label{varmledef}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] upon defining the fisher information @xmath15 ^ 2 \\frac1{p(x | \\lambda ) } \\label{fisherdef}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to prove @xcite that @xmath16 where @xmath5 is the number of measurements . the inequality in eq .

    "is known as the cramr - rao bound @xcite on the precision of ml estimation .",
    "notice that this bound holds for any functional form of the probability distribution @xmath17 , provided that the fisher information exists @xmath18 and @xmath19 exists @xmath20 . when an experiment has `` good statistics '' ( i.e. a data sample large enough ) the cramr - rao bound is saturated .",
    "as we will show in the following , the application of the ml principle in quantum optics generally corresponds to estimators for which the cramr - rao bound is attained with a relatively small number of measurements , i.e. the ml procedure provides an efficient estimation of the parameters . in sections [ s : gauss ] and [ s : phase ] examples will be examined where the probability @xmath17 is gaussian versus @xmath1 and not gaussian versus the parameter @xmath2 , whereas in section [ s : eta ] an example with discrete measurement outcomes ( @xmath21 ) will be also analyzed .",

    "such a detrimental effect of quantum efficiency is similar to the effect of losses in squeezed - state homodyne communication channels @xcite .",
    "however , it can be partially stemmed by adopting a feedback - assisted homodyne detection @xcite .",
    "in principle , in a photodetector each photon ionizes a single atom , and the resulting charge is amplified to produce a measurable pulse . in practice , however , available photodetectors are usually characterized by a quantum efficiency lower than unity , which means that only a fraction of the incoming photons lead to an electric pulse , and ultimately to a `` count '' .",
    "if the resulting current is proportional to the incoming photon flux we have a linear photodetector .",
    "this is , for example , the case of the high flux photodetectors used in homodyne detection .",
    "on the other hand , photodetectors operating at very low intensities resort to avalanche process in order to transform a single ionization event into a recordable pulse .",
    "this implies that one can not discriminate between a single photon or many photons as the outcomes from such detectors are either a `` click '' , corresponding to any number of photons , or `` nothing '' which means that no photons have been revealed . in this section",

    "the performances of the ml estimation can be compared to the `` naive '' estimation based only on the measurement of the mean value , i.e. @xmath117 .",
    "we expect this method to be less efficient , since the quantum efficiency not only rescales the mean value , but also spreads the variance of the homodyne distribution in eq .",

    "on the other hand , for small values of the squeezing fraction the two methods have similar performances , except for very low signals , whereas the ml estimation performs better .",

    "the maximum of @xmath126 , i.e. the mle for the quantum efficiency , satisfies the equation @xmath127 whose solution , of course , depends on the choice of the reference state .",
    "the optimal choice would be using single - photon states as a reference . in this case",

    "in quantum optics , there are several parameters of great interest corresponding to quantities that are not directly observable . among these",
    ", we studied the parameters of a gaussian state , the phase of a squeezed - coherent state , and the quantum efficiency of either linear or single - photon resolving photodetector . in this paper , we have applied the maximum - likelihood method to the determination of these parameters using feasible detection schemes . in particular , we have considered homodyne detection and on / off photodetection . in all cases here",
    "analyzed , the resulting estimators are efficient , unbiased and consistent , thus providing a statistically reliable determination of the parameters of interest . moreover , by using the ml method only few thousand data are required for the precise determination of parameters .",
    "we stress that the ml procedure used in this paper can be applied to a broad class of estimation process , since it applies to any probability distribution @xmath17 , as long as its functional form is known and the maximum of the likelihood function is unique . in conclusion , for the measurement of parameters pertaining to quantum states or optical devices , the ml procedure should be taken into account , in order to optimize data analysis and thus reducing the experimental efforts .",
