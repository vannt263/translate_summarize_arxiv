    "the fundamental quantum properties of atomic systems are under intense investigation in recent cold - atom experiments , in which long - time predicted universal aspects of few - body physics can be probed . in this regard , the increasing number of three - body bound states ( trimers ) , emerging when the absolute value of the two - body scattering length is moved to infinity , known as efimov effect  @xcite , was confirmed in different cold - atom laboratories  @xcite .",
    "actually , by extending to more than three particles the search for fundamental quantum behavior , in the realm of four - body physics it is of interest to test the positions of four - atom resonant recombination peaks  @xcite , which appear as the two - body scattering length is tuned close to an @xmath3wave feshbach resonance ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the model independence of tetramer properties , when few physical scales are fixed , was recently numerically established by our group  @xcite , through the analysis of observed correlations between tetramer observables , by considering a renormalized zero - range ( rzr ) approach .",
    "these correlations were realized through appropriate scaling functions , from where one can verify that the rzr results are consistent with several other model calculations  @xcite .    despite the success of the model independence of the tetramer scaling functions , the experimental data for cesium atoms  @xcite",
    "are shifted with respect to the correlation function relating the peaks of successive tetramer resonances for a zero - range force  @xcite . among the possible effects to explain such a deviation from the results obtained with zero - range two - body interaction , it is natural to think in a way to introduce the correction due to a finite effective range in the model , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the experimental data for three - body cold - atom reactions show that efimov resonances and recombination minima survive in the intermediate regime when the scattering length @xmath4 exceeds the characteristic interaction range by a relatively small factor  @xcite .",
    "but the positions are shifted away from the naive predictions based on the universal theory  @xcite and finite range potentials have been used @xcite to address such issues . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantitative reproduction of the experimental findings for the positions of the peaks of the tetramers resonances has been not yet addressed in detail .    within our aim in clarifying the shift in the experimental data with respect to the zero - range predictions for the positions of the tetramer resonances at the dissociation point , we present an approach on how to introduce the effective range correction in lowest order in the zero - range four - body theory .",
    "we obtain the correction to the correlation of the positions of two successive resonant four - boson recombination peaks .",
    "the associated scaling function is not fully determined by the trimer properties and requires a four - boson scale  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we are showing by our calculations that the effective range correction is not completely parameterized by the trimer and tetramer short - range scales , as one could naively expect .",
    "the contribution of a non - zero effective range affects the observed scaling plots , by moving the corresponding positions in relation to the zero - ranged ones ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite in the case of trimers ) . here",
    ", it will be shown quantitatively how the effective range affects the scaling between negative scattering length ratios , corresponding to the dissociation positions of a trimer and related tetramers ( for two nearby tetramer states , associated with a given trimer state ) .",
    "relevant to the understanding of the effective range contribution to the resonance positions , we should recall the nice and clear discussion by chin et al .",
    "@xcite on the role of broad ( entrance - channel dominated ) and narrow ( closed - channel dominated ) feshbach resonances .",
    "as discussed , a feshbach resonance strongly dominated by the entrance channel allows a description of a two - atom system in terms of a single - channel short - ranged model with a van der waals tail .",
    "the broad @xmath3wave feshbach resonance of cesium  @xcite , where tetramer dissociations at the four - body continuum threshold were observed , is dominated by an entrance - channel . in this case , when the strength parameter is very large ( @xmath5 ) , the single - channel description is applicable  @xcite and consequently , the effective range should be found around the values obtained for van der waals like potentials , tuned to the scattering length of the resonance .",
    "indeed , as we are going to detail in the present work , the estimated values we have obtained for the effective ranges , from the positions of tetramer resonances , are somewhat close to the corresponding effective range of that class of potentials . within our approach to extract the effective range , we have considered broad feshbach resonances appearing in ultracold gas of cesium atoms , leading to positive effective ranges .",
    "in contrast , narrow resonances , as discussed by petrov  @xcite , should lead to negative effective ranges . in the case of systems with narrow resonances and denser spectrum",
    ", we should also mention the recent work by srensen et al .",
    "@xcite .",

    "this method ensures that the three - body subtraction scale fixes the three - body properties consistently with the subtracted stm equation , whereas the regularization parameter @xmath32 fixes the four - body observables  @xcite .",

    "the resonance is reached by tuning the negative scattering length close to a feshbach resonance ( see e.g. @xcite ) . the theoretical description of the scaling function , which correlates the values of the negative scattering lengths where successive tetramers reach the continuum , introduced in @xcite , is now extended to include the effective range , as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the position of the peak of the three - atom resonant recombination for @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the scattering length for which the excited @xmath37-th tetramer dissociates and meets the four - body continuum . the solutions of the subtracted stm ( [ fe1 ] ) and fy equations ( [ fye1],[fye2 ] ) depend only on @xmath4 , @xmath9 , and on the three- and four - body scale parameters .",

    "the solutions of the subtracted fy equations depend only on @xmath4 , @xmath9 , and on the three- and four - body scale parameters .",

    "calculations are performed in a leading order expansion of the solutions of the fy equations with the two - body amplitude ( [ texp ] ) , see text for further explanation . , width=336 ]    in our calculations we have only obtained results for tetramers below the ground state trimer , which should be enough for our study , as the values of the scattering length are much larger than the short - range length scales , corresponding to the three- and four - body subtraction points .",
    "the scaling function @xmath46 , which provides the correction to the position of the four - atom resonance is shown in the 3d plot of fig .",

    "@xmath49 , and for the validity of the expansion in the effective range one should have @xmath50 , and the expansion of the scattering length ( [ a ] ) is questionable .",
    "fortunately , we found that the coefficients for the effective range correction are fairly small , allowing to extend the validity of the expansion to the region where data are found .    within the region of the plot given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the surface can be parameterized by @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . the coefficients are given in the following table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".coefficients for the parametrization ( [ parameter ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is noticeable that the dissociation point of cesium ground state efimov trimers for negative scattering lengths are found in a narrow band@xcite , independently on which feshbach resonance the system is tuned ( see table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "theoretical works  @xcite addressed the interesting issue of the physical mechanism for the dominance of the two - body properties on the position of the first efimov resonance for @xmath35 , when the trimer meets the continuum .",
    "the results in table [ table2 ] show a range of values for @xmath9 extracted from the tetramer and trimer resonances , which within errors ( excepting one data set ) are consistent with the effective range values from the van der waals type potential .",
    "the numerical analysis of wang et al .",
    "@xcite has shown that two - body interactions , which suppress efficiently the wave function for separation distances less than @xmath9 , have @xmath55 , determined by two - body properties , with this class of systems closely related to entrance - channel dominated feshbach resonances .",
    "the dominance of the single channel potential with the van der waals tail in the three - cesium reactions , with suppression of the short distance wave function , putted forward the narrow band where the trimer dissociation position is found .",
    "it also suggests that the effective range seen through the shift of the position of the four - atom recombination peak with respect to the zero - range results , should be given by the van der waals tail of the potential , as well .",
    "it is worthwhile to address the validity of the correction due the effective range , considering the main results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and table [ table2 ] . in view of the expansion given in eq.([texp ] ) , which at a first glance would be doubtful , when @xmath56 , we found consistence between the present calculations with the results obtained with short - range separable@xcite and local@xcite interactions .",
    "the leading coefficient for the expansion in @xmath57 is one fifth of the corresponding coefficient for the dependence of the scaling function in @xmath58 ( see table [ table1 ] ) , which shows that the extracted values of @xmath9 using the scaling plot comes from small corrections to the zero - range scaling function .",
    "therefore , as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the agreement of the expansion we have considered can be extended also to cases near @xmath59 .",
    "in this work , we present an approach to extract the effective range of a given atomic system from the shifts in the four - body recombination peaks , at the tetramer dissociation threshold , with respect to the zero - range results .",
    "we solved the trimer and tetramer subtracted zero - range integral equations with two - body amplitudes carrying the effective range in lowest order . besides",
    ", the trimer and tetramer subtracting scales , no further parameters are introduced in the calculations .",
    "the correlation between the negative scattering lengths where successive tetramers dissociates at the four - body continuum is extended to include the correction due to the effective range , which is model independent checked against different short - range potential model calculations .",
    "we found that the effective range correction of the on - shell two - body amplitude in the calculation of the trimer and tetramer dissociation points , when presented as a correlation plot of the successive positions of the tetramer resonances is not completely parameterized by the trimer and tetramer short - range scales , as one could naively expect .",
    "this unexpected property turned to be essential to single out the effective range from the shift in the positions of the four - atom recombination peaks with respect to the zero - range theory .",
    "we applied our proposal to the cesium data measured at broad @xmath3wave feshbach resonances  @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we considered the shifts of the observed recombination peaks at the tetramer dissociation positions with respect to the zero - range results .",
    "the effective ranges were found within the interval @xmath60 , with a reference value of 3.9@xmath61 , obtained by the error weighted average of the @xmath9 s extracted from the data of refs .",
    "these values are consistent with the van der waals potential tail for the broad @xmath3wave feshbach resonances of the @xmath2 system , providing @xmath9 within the interval of @xmath62 for the scattering lengths where the resonances were found .",
    "our results put a strong evidence on the prevalence of the entrance - channel dominance in the physics of the universal tetramers formed with broad feshbach resonances .",
    "the question on how the effective range is sensible to feshbach resonance manipulations in the scattering length as suggested by ( [ eq : bogaoformula-1 ] ) has to be considered .",
    "once improved experimental data are available , it will be possible to verify in more detail how feshbach resonances from different setups affect the @xmath9 values extracted from the trimer and tetramer dissociation points .",
    "the present analysis , based on the universality of effective range correction to the position of tetramer resonances , can be generally applied to any other cold - atom bosonic system close to feshbach resonances .",
