    "although it seems plausible that such rotating and collapsing configurations will eventually form a disk , the involved observations usually lack the spatial resolution to firmly verify such a claim .",

    "must be questioned : @xcite report a bipolar structure , similar to what we present in this letter .",
    "however , @xcite recently revised its mass to a value that lies just below what is commonly accepted as `` high mass '' .",
    "furthermore , @xcite explained their detection of radio continuum emission as shocked gas caused by a protostellar jet , although they also discussed free - free emission from ionised gas as a possible source .        in the present study , we investigated the hyper - compact region ( hchii ) m17-uc1 ( see sect .",

    "apart from the br@xmath40 line emission , which most likely originates from scattered photons emitted by the gas inside the hchii , the spectrum appears featureless .    in the @xmath24 band",
    ", m17-uc1 displays a deep silicate feature ( fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) ; its existence was already suggested by earlier photometric data @xcite .",
    "this absorption indicates the presence of cool dust along the line of sight towards m17-uc1 . using the standard relation for converting optical depths of @xmath41 @xcite",
    ", we infer a visual extinction of about 40mag .",
    "the luminosity between 1.6 and 20@xmath4 m corrected for extinction is @xmath42 being consistent with an early b - type star .",
    "all our broad - band photometric data from previous epochs that were obtained with different filters trace the shape of the silicate absorption feature fairly well .",
    "this rules out possible mir flux variations that were suggested by @xcite .",
    "although our broad @xmath24 band imaging filter also includes the silicate feature , we only see the extended warm emitting dust in fig .",
    "[ kln - rgb ] .",
    "the symmetric absorption pattern of m17-uc1 in the @xmath5 band along with the perpendicularly scattered light nebulosities on both sides very much resembles the appearance of young low - mass stars with circumstellar disks ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this view is supported by the morphology of theoretically derived synthetic images of protostellar disks presented by @xcite .",
    "these images are based on varying disk radius and accretion rate , among which one can find suiting representations of the @xmath43 image of m17-uc1 .",
    "in addition , the class ii methanol masers that are located in the general direction of the supposed disk support our conjecture .    apart from the almost uniformly extended @xmath14 and @xmath24 band emission one would expect to see the supposed disk to be emitting strongly in the mir , too . nevertheless , there must be cool dust inside the disk as witnessed by the silicate absorption feature .",
    "we interpret the elongated shape of the central mir emission perpendicular to the disk orientation as scattered light from the central source .",
    "due to the lower optical depth , however , the mir disk emission is veiled by the silicate absorption and scattered mir photons . at larger distances from the hchii",
    ", we see a warmer and less dense envelope strongly emitting in the mir .",
    "interestingly , stellar mir emission is not necessarily attributed to disks , but can also originate from the walls of outflow cavities where the ambient interstellar medium interacts with the gas stream @xcite .",
    "in fact , the @xmath5 band nebulae could also be dominated by emission from an outflow with a wide opening angle . in this case",
    ", the narrow waist would indicate a small disk that restricts the outflow in these directions .",
    "however , our @xmath5 band spectrum does not show any hints for shocks or outflows , so we discard this interpretation .",
    "we have modelled the @xmath44 m radiation with a star - disk system using a 3d radiative transfer code described by @xcite .",
    "the star was assumed to have @xmath45k .",
    "the disk has a radial power - law density profile with an exponential atmosphere above and below the disk midplane like    @xmath46\\ ] ]    with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the number density normalisation , @xmath49 the scale height , @xmath50 the inner radius , and @xmath51 the outer radius where the disk vanishes . the @xmath5 band image with the triangular absorption is well represented by parameters @xmath52m@xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56au , @xmath57au ( fig .  [ model ] ) and standard @xmath58m - sized silicate dust particles with opacities taken from @xcite .",
    "the inclination of the disk is about @xmath59 ( edge - on @xmath60 ) .",
    "we obtain a lower mass limit of @xmath61 from the scattered light that only probes the surface of the disk . a similar mass limit",
    "is derived from the extinction that blocks the stellar light at @xmath44 m .",
    "of course , more mass can be hidden in the interior of the disk without affecting the appearance of the object .",
    "likewise , for a mildly edge - on disk , additional dust could reside outside the scattered light pattern .    we have also carried out radiative transfer calculations for the alternative scenario of a dusty filament that is unrelated to m17-uc1 .",
    "we modelled dust configurations of differing sizes and masses located at various distances in front of the star .",
    "in contrast to the observed morphology , the scattered light generally extends farther out along the filament , and the intensity ratio between the strong south - western peak and the faint north - eastern peak can not be reproduced satisfactorily ( fig .",
    "[ model ] ) .",
    "therefore , the radiative transfer calculations also favour the disk model over the filament model .",
    "we have presented new nir and mir observations of the hyper - compact hii region m17-uc1 . as a prominent feature , the @xmath43 band image shows a dark lane in scattered light producing a substantial silicate absorption feature observed in the mir . analysing the image with radiative transfer models , we find the best agreement by assuming a disk - like structure around the central source instead of a foreground filament .",
    "for this reason and because of the `` high mass '' nature of the embedded star as determined by many independent measurements , we suggest that m17-uc1 might be the first doubtless candidate of a hchii where at least parts of a circumstellar disk are still present .",
