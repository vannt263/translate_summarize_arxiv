    "the dmft captures most of the relevant local quantum dynamical effects of electron correlations .",
    "recent progress in the development of various impurity solvers for the dmft has opened a way for combining advanced many - body techniques with ab initio methods to build realistic computational schemes for materials with strongly correlated electrons .",
    "the standard way of combining ab initio calculations with the dmft is via multiorbital hubbard models .",
    "the input parameters for multiorbital hubbard models to be solved within the dmft are determined from ab initio calculations , for example using the linearized muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method  @xcite .",
    "no universal scheme to solve the dmft equations exactly does exist .",
    "hence , one has to resort to approximate impurity solvers to reach quantitative results from the dmft .",
    "we distinguish essentially two types of dmft solvers : numerical schemes and analytical methods based on many - body perturbation theory .",
    "the former schemes aim at numerically exact quantitative solutions while the latter at analytically controllable schemes .",
    "although analytic methods are not quantitatively as accurate as the numerical solutions , they have an appealing feature in that they offer an analytically controllable approach with a direct access to spectral functions on the real frequency axis .",
    "analytic approaches are needed in most situations to complement the numerical solutions so that we can assess the peak structure of spectral functions when performing analytic continuation of numerical results from the imaginary axis of matsubara frequencies . to gain confidence in approaches based on many - body perturbation theory",
    "we should test them in simpler situations and compare their results with available more precise numerical simulations .    in the context of the one - band model ,",
    "extensive comparisons between perturbative approaches such as the the iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) and the qmc method have been carried out ( see , for example , refs .",
    "it appeared that the non - self - consistent ipt is a rather accurate approximation .",
    "analytic extension of the ipt and second - order perturbation theory via multiple two - particle scatterings , the flex , has already been applied to iron and nickel in self - consistent and non - self - consistent forms.@xcite however , a critical discussion of accuracy of this method in multi - band situation and comparison with e.g. qmc have not yet been carried out .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to fill this void , and compare diagrammatic schemes with dynamical fluctuations based on two - particle scatterings with finite - temperature quantum monte carlo solution of the dmft . to this end",
    "we use a multiorbital hubbard model with a simplified kinetic energy so that we can focus our attention on the fundamental features of the transition between weak and strong electron couplings in multiorbital hubbard models .",
    "a typical form of the hamiltonian used in dynamical extensions of dft schemes is @xmath1 where @xmath2 are lattice site coordinates and @xmath3 are spin - orbital indices .",
    "the hopping term @xmath4 is determined from _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations and will be replaced in this comparison study with a model dispersion relation diagonal in the spin - orbital indices .",
    "the electron interaction is usually considered only between the @xmath5-electrons , since the effect of the lower orbitals is assumed to be described quite well within the standard dft .",
    "we assume that the local interaction consists only of direct and exchange terms .",
    "we approximate the interaction operator with two parameters only : the hubbard @xmath6 and the exchange constant @xmath7 .",

    "( [ eq : sde ] ) is the static hartree term expressing the self - energy in terms of densities .",
    "this term in realistic calculations is normally part of the static local density approximation fixing the static particle densities .",
    "we hence suppress the hartree term and use only the vertex contribution to the self - energy as a generator of dynamical fluctuations missing in the dft .    the simplest approximation on the vertex function",
    "@xmath11 is the bare interaction @xmath15 .",
    "such an approximation corresponds to second - order perturbation theory ( sopt ) .",
    "the vertex is momentum independent . even in more advanced approximations",
    "we will not use the full momentum dependence of the vertex function . in our treatment",

    "the idea of the dmft is to neglect the momentum dependence of the one - electron propagators in the contributions to the self - energy .",
    "we hence use only the local parts of the one - electron propagators , i.  e. , @xmath30 .",
    "then , all the above formulas hold with the replacements @xmath31 , @xmath32 for fermionic and bosonic momenta , respectively .",
    "the advantage of analytic approaches with multiple two - particle scatterings is the knowledge of the explicit analytic structure of the self - energy .",

    "this propagator goes over into the bare propagator in the atomic limit and does not contain long energy tails due to frequency convolutions in the definition of the self - energy .",
    "this partially non - self - consistent scheme resembles ipt .",
    "hence a better description of the transition from weak to strong coupling regimes at the one - particle level , including the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) , is expected from the ipt than from the conserving scheme with fully renormalized propagators , where the metal - insulator transition at half filling is known to be missing .      among many methods used to solve the impurity problem we choose the quantum monte carlo method  @xcite to benchmark",
    "flex as a potential candidate for impurity solver .",
    "there are well known advantages and disadvantages of the qmc method and our choice is spurred by the fact that despite being slower than other methods , the qmc is well controlled , numerically exact method . as an input the qmc procedure gets weiss function @xmath36 and as an output it produces green s function @xmath37 .",
    "we remind the reader major steps taken in the qmc procedure .",
    "usually one starts with an impurity effective action @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are fermionic annihilation and creation operators of the lattice problem , @xmath41 .",
    "the first what we should do with the action ( [ eq : simp ] ) is to discretize it in imaginary time with time step @xmath42 so that @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the number of time intervals : @xmath45 the next step is to get rid of the interaction term @xmath6 by substituting it by summation over ising - like auxiliary fields .",
    "the decoupling procedure is called the hubbard - stratonovich transformation  @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are auxiliary ising fields at each time slice .    in the one - band anderson impurity model",
    "we have only one auxiliary ising field @xmath49 at _ each time slice _ , whereas in the multiorbital case number of auxiliary fields is equal to the number of @xmath50 pairs .",
    "applying the hubbard - stratonovich transformation at each time slice we bring the action to a quadratic form with the partition function : @xmath51 where the green function in terms of auxiliary fields @xmath52 reads @xmath53 with the interaction matrix @xmath54 where + @xmath55 for @xmath56 + @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "+ once the quadratic form is obtained one can apply wick s theorem at each time slice and perform the gaussian integration in grassmann variables to get the full interacting green function : @xmath59    to evaluate summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gfull ] ) one uses monte carlo stochastic sampling .",
    "the product of determinants is interpreted as the stochastic weight and auxiliary spin configurations are generated by a markov process with probability proportional to their statistical weight .",
    "more rigorous derivation can be find elsewhere  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since the qmc method produces results in imaginary time axis ( @xmath60 with @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) and the dmft self - consistency equations make use of the frequency dependent green s functions and self - energies we must have an accurate method to compute fourier transforms from the time to the frequency domain .",
    "this is done by representing the functions in the time domain by a cubic splined functions which should go through original points with condition of continuous second derivatives imposed .",
    "once we know cubic spline coefficients we can compute the fourier transformation of the splined functions analytically .",
    "to compare analytic solutions with numerical ones we employed a simple model with two degenerate bands , i.e. , four spin - orbitals per site and assumed a semi - elliptic density of states ( dos ) , @xmath63 .",
    "for simplicity we resorted to the case @xmath64 and non - magnetic solutions .",
    "we tested second - order perturbation theory together with multiple scatterings from the electron - hole and electron - electron interaction channels .",
    "both types of self - consistency were considered , i.  e. , the full conserving and the partial one with the bath function @xmath65 , defined in the ipt eq .",
    "( [ eq : bath - gf ] ) .",
    "all approximations were analytically continued to real frequencies before being evaluated numerically .",
    "maximum entropy method was used for analytical continuation to real axis .",
    "we tested maximum entropy method against other high - frequency more reliable methods like non - crossing approximation and one - crossing approximation and found satisfactory agreement understandable within limitations of all used methods .",
    "a simple iteration procedure with a suitably chosen mixing of the old and new self - energy led to well converged results for moderate values of the pair interaction @xmath6 .",
    "the details of the numerical implementation of multiorbital flex - type approximations were described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "first , we compared the analytical approximations among themselves for an intermediate value of the interaction strength , @xmath66 .",
    "all energies are given in units of the half - bandwidth of the non - interacting dos , @xmath67 .",
    "we also wrote two different flex programs on real and imaginary axes and used 9000 and 4096 points on corresponding frequency domain with large enough frequency cut - off ( @xmath68 ) for temperature @xmath69 .",
    "using the conserving full self - consistence we found that results of sopt and the electron - electron @xmath0-matrix approximation tma are quite close to each other .",
    "the addition of the electron - hole tma channel changes the result significantly .",
    "the quasiparticle width gets substantially reduced as shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "this strong band narrowing is unphysical .",
    "we did not include the third channel , screening by the electron - hole polarization bubbles , explicitly to this figure , since it contributes quantitatively and qualitatively similarly to the electron - hole ladder .",
    "the reason why the electron - hole scatterings do not improve upon second order is quite clear . at the mean - field level",
    "an instability towards the local moment state with non - zero @xmath70 appears at some critical interaction .",
    "this instability is totally artificial because the conduction electrons screen the local moment ( kondo effect ) . in the non - self - consistent flex approach including both electron - electron and electron - hole tma , this instability also occurs when the denominator in the above equation contains a pole at zero frequency , for example for two - band hubbard model with half bandwidth equal to one the instability happens at @xmath71 , for temperature @xmath72 .",
    "so the presence of this artificial instability will push the results obtained by non - self - consistent flex approach including electron - hole tma away from the right answer . for the self - consistent flex approach including electron - hole tma",
    ", the instability happens for @xmath6 slightly larger than two for the same model , indicating tendency to a phase transition from the paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic solution in the lattice case what is unphysical for the impurity problem .",
    "thus , this unphysical divergence overestimates the contribution of the electron - hole scatterings and the result worsens with increasing the interaction strength . to improve",
    "this one can use kanamori s  @xcite observation that the particle - hole bubbles should interact not with the bare interaction but with an effective one screened by the particle - particle ladder i.e. replace @xmath6 by @xmath73 equal to electron - electron @xmath0-matrix taken at zero frequency .",
    "densities of states for @xmath66 , @xmath74 ( half - filled case ) calculated within the second - order perturbation theory ( dot - dashed line ) , electron - electron tma ( solid line ) , and electron - hole tma ( dashed line ) .",
    "the one - particle propagators are fully renormalized in the self - consistent calculations ( @xmath75 $ ] ) . ]    as it is known from the single - band situation , neither of the flex - type approximations is able to trace the emergence of satellite hubbard bands and the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the high - energy spectrum is shapeless and broadened due to energy convolutions .",
    "this situation changes dramatically if we keep only the topological self - consistence of the one - particle propagators obtained from the ipt , see figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "we can see that second order and the electron - electron tma produces the hubbard satellite bands in their correct positions .",
    "the sopt scatterings add an additional internal structure to the satellite bands . while the satellite bands gain more weight than they actually have at this interaction strength , the central quasiparticle peak weight is strongly reduced in non - self - consistent or partly self - consistent approximations .",
    "too much quasiparticle weight is transferred to the hubbard bands . in the electron - hole scattering channel",
    "we get slight changes in the positions of the hubbard bands , and slight decrease of the quasiparticle width . even for rather weak interactions",
    "@xmath76 one observes nearly total disappearance of the quasiparticle peak when including the electron - hole scattering channel .",
    "due to this unphysical behavior at moderate electron coupling and the instability towards the local state formation we leave the electron - hole scattering channel out from further considerations .",
    "there is no way at the flex level to improve upon the results from the electron - electron scattering channel .",
    "the best we could do is to add contributions from all three distinct channels .",
    "but we had to subtract second order contribution to the self - energy which dominates at moderate and intermediate couplings so that we obtain negative density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "the only real improvements can be reached by a new self - consistent coupling of the electron - electron and electron - hole channels of the parquet type .",
    "since we are not yet able to implement parquet - type self - consistence in multiorbital models and have to stay within flex , we compare only results of analytical approximations based on second order perturbation theory and electron - electron @xmath0-matrix against qmc data .",
    "densities of states for @xmath66 , @xmath74 ( half - filled case ) calculated within the second - order perturbation theory ( solid line ) , electron - electron tma ( dashed line ) , and electron - hole tma ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the one - particle propagators are partially renormalized by using the iterated perturbation method ( @xmath77 $ ] ) . ]    to compare the analytic flex results with quantum monte carlo simulations , we use both versions of the self - consistency . in figure",
    "[ fig6 ] the density of states at @xmath78 calculated within the electron - electron @xmath0-matrix approximation is shown along with the one deduced from the qmc . as one can see from the plot , the conserving tma fits better the quasiparticle peak than the tma with the ipt bath green function @xmath65 .",
    "in addition , the ipt tma seems to overemphasize the role of the satellite peaks at weak coupling as there are no satellites in the qmc solution for this coupling strength .",
    "if we increase the interaction to @xmath66 ( see figure  [ fig7 ] ) and compare the same curves as in the previous plot , we notice that the conserving tma still very well reproduces the quasiparticle peak , whereas the ipt tma keeps the tendency to reducing the central peak in favor of the satellites . at this coupling the satellites",
    "are formed also in the qmc solution but not as strongly as the ipt tma predicts .",
    "notice that positions of the satellites reproduced by the ipt solution are rather close to the ones coming from qmc .",

    "it is clear that the closer @xmath82 curve for a particular approximation to the qmc data the better the approximation works in reproducing the quasiparticle properties of the system , including the central peak weight and width . in figure  [ fig8 ]",
    "we presented the following curves : qmc data are plotted by solid curve with open circle symbols , results of the second order perturbation theory in the cases of fully renormalized one - particle propagators in the self - consistent calculations ( @xmath75 $ ] ) and partially renormalized by using the iterated perturbation method ( @xmath77 $ ] ) are given by dashed and dot - dashed lines correspondingly .",
    "concentrating on small and intermediate values of interaction , we can see that in the first case of the full renormalization of the propagators the situation is significantly better as the dashed curve goes much closer to the qmc one than the dot - dashed curve .",

    "this result differs from the findings in the case of the one - band hubbard model , where partially renormalized propagators gave better agreement with monte carlo results .",

    "<S> we study the two band degenerate hubbard model using the fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex ) and compare the results with quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations . </S>",
    "<S> both the self - consistent and the non - self - consistent versions of the flex scheme are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , contrary to the one - band case , in the multiband case , good agreement with the quantum monte carlo results is obtained within the electron - electron @xmath0-matrix approximation using the full renormalization of the one - particle propagators . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover to strong coupling and the formation of satellites is more clearly visible in the non - self - consistent scheme . </S>",
    "<S> finally we discuss the behavior of the flex for higher orbital degeneracy . </S>"
