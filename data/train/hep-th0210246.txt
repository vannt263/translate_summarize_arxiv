    "following earlier work on maximally supersymmetric solutions of eleven - dimensional supergravity  @xcite , a new maximally supersymmetric solution of type iib supergravity  @xcite was found .",
    "this paved the way for quantisation in light - cone gauge of superstring theory in a constant flux  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum consists of a unique massless groundstate on which a tower of massive states is constructed  @xcite using creation operators whose masses are of order @xmath2 where @xmath3 @xmath4 is momentum along the @xmath5 light - cone direction and @xmath6 is the flux .",
    "this new string background merits further investigation .",
    "since the string spectrum in the pp - wave background is now known , string interactions are the next step in the study of the pp - wave background . in this background ten - dimensional lorentz invariance",
    "is broken by the non - zero flux , and hence it is no longer possible to set @xmath4 to zero in general scattering amplitudes .",
    "this obstruction significantly hinders the vertex operator approach to string interactions .",
    "there is only one other known way of studying string interactions in light - cone gauge pioneered by mandelstam  @xcite for the bosonic string . in this approach an interaction vertex for the scattering of three strings can be constructed by requiring continuity of string fields on the worldsheet depicted in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "this continuity is enforced by a delta functional on string fields @xmath7        for computational purposes it is essential to express the delta functional in fourier modes  @xcite .",
    "the interaction vertex may then be written as an exponential of creation operators which enforce the delta functional conditions mode by mode .",
    "the functional approach  @xcite can be extended to the superstring  @xcite .",
    "the cubic interaction vertex is a first order in string coupling @xmath8 correction to the free hamiltonian . in order to satisfy the superalgebra with this new hamiltonian",
    ", dynamical supercharges also receive corrections . this essential difference from the bosonic string modifies the form of the vertex  @xcite . in particular  @xcite , in the oscillator basis , the superstring interaction vertex as well as the dynamical supercharges not only have a part exponential in creation operators , but also have a prefactor which is polynomial in creation operators",
    ". the exact form of the prefactors is determined by two requirements .",
    "firstly , they should not destroy worldsheet continuity enforced by the exponential part of the vertex .",
    "secondly , the superalgebra should be satisfied order by order in string coupling . in  @xcite an oscillator expression for the flat spacetime superstring",
    "vertex and dynamical supercharges was constructed and shown to satisfy all said consistency conditions .    in this paper",
    "we apply the formalism of  @xcite to the pp - wave background in order to construct an interaction vertex and dynamical supercharges in the oscillator basis .",
    "we prove explicitly that our expressions satisfy all the aforementioned consistency conditions .",
    "we use this vertex to compute various three - point functions in string theory .",
    "the pp - wave interaction vertex has also been recently investigated in  @xcite .",
    "our results differ from the expressions presented in  @xcite in several ways .",
    "firstly , our bosonic prefactor contains a piece , not present in  @xcite , proportional to @xmath9 ( _ cf_. equation  ) .",
    "this piece is crucial in proving ( see section  [ sec4 ] ) that the dynamically generated supercharges and interaction hamiltonian satisfy the pp - wave superalgebra at first order in string coupling .",
    "further , without it , three - point functions of states containing only fermionic creation operators would vanish ( see section  [ sec52 ] ) .",
    "secondly , we also present the oscillator - basis expression for the fermionic prefactor ; in particular , the @xmath10-dependent normalisation ( _ cf_. equation  ) is essential in proving that the dynamical superalgebra is satisfied .",
    "the exponential part of our vertex also contains a piece linear in fermionic zero - modes  @xcite ( _ cf_. equation  ) and our expression for the coefficients of the negatively moded bosonic creation operators in the prefactor ( _ cf_. equation  ) differs by a factor of @xmath11  @xcite from the original one in  @xcite . discrepancy . ]",
    "since we prove that our expressions for the dynamical supercharges and hamiltonian satisfy the superalgebra , we believe that the vertex constructed here is the correct one .    the pp - wave background can be obtained as a penrose limit  @xcite of @xmath12  @xcite . through the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence  @xcite , this has led to a conjectured duality between string theory in the pp - wave background and a double scaling limit of su(@xmath13 ) , @xmath14 super yang - mills theory  @xcite .",
    "explicitly one considers a sector of ( bmn ) operators with @xmath15 r - charge @xmath16 and conformal dimension @xmath17 such that the difference @xmath18 remains fixed in the limit @xmath16 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 fixed  @xcite .",
    "the bmn operators are field theory duals of perturbative string states in the pp - wave background .",
    "the sym theory is believed to be expandable in a double series in the effective genus counting parameter @xmath22 and effective coupling @xmath23  @xcite @xmath24 moreover , the finite quantity @xmath18 is a function of @xmath23  @xcite and @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the expansion parameters @xmath25 and @xmath23 are related to string theory parameters by  @xcite @xmath26 one of the most appealing aspects of this duality is that both string theory and the bmn sector of gauge theory are simultaneously perturbatively accessible .",
    "while some further investigation seems necessary to clarify the exact form of this correspondence , at the planar ( interacting ) field theory two - point function / free string level , there is increasing evidence  @xcite that the bmn operators do correspond to the free string theory .",
    "the extension of the duality beyond this limit , by considering string interactions and the non - planar sector of ( interacting ) gauge theory respectively , needs further clarification .",
    "indeed , the exact notion of the penrose limit in a cft needs to be better understood  @xcite . by focusing on a certain subclass of the bmn operators , several proposals for such an extension of the bmn correspondence have been made and were studied in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use our interaction vertex to compute three - point functions for various string states .",
    "in particular , for the class of amplitudes studied so far in the literature the term in the cubic vertex proportional to @xmath27 does not contribute and we recover the results of  @xcite .",
    "we show that so - called impurity preserving three - point functions of states dual to a class of protected operators vanish in string theory , as would be expected by the extension of the duality recently proposed in  @xcite .",
    "further , we compute three - point functions for string states having only fermionic creation operators . here",
    "only the @xmath27 term contributes and these amplitudes may provide a check of any extension of the string - bit dynamical supercharges to terms bilinear in fermions , which are not known at present  @xcite .",
    "we hope our results can shed some light on the bmn correspondence and that the three - string vertex can be used to investigate the duality further .",
