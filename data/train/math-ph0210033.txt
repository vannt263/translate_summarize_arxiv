    "interest in volumes of compact manifolds appearing in physics arises for several reasons .",
    "for example , in instanton calculations it is necessary to integrate over the gauge group @xcite ; in quantum field theories over curved spaces , the volumes of the compact spaces enter very often @xcite . for entangled qubit states the geometry of the corresponding groups @xmath0 and quotient spaces @xmath1 are important ; etc .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to compute the volumes of several types of compact manifolds in a systematic way .",
    "we proceed from the most symmetric cases ( spheres ) to the less symmetric ( flag manifolds ) .",
    "essential ingredients are the scale ( `` radius '' ) of the manifold , the setting of coordinates and their ranges .",
    "all these spaces will be riemannian , so we compute the volume with respect to that metric ; all our manifolds will also be _ homogeneous _ manifolds @xmath2 .",
    "we define the manifold @xmath3 in terms of some parameters @xmath4 in some local charts , so as to cover the whole manifold .",
    "the metric will look locally as @xmath5 the associated volume element is @xmath6 and the volume is ( for one chart only ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the range of the @xmath9 parameter ; much of our discussion will be about these ranges .    in all cases",
    "the scale of the object to be measured will be stated in a `` natural '' manner ; we shall make comparison with other choices made in the literature when convenient : it is not always easy to recognize the different conventions used .",
    "in fact , it is only for spheres that the universal criterion is the unit radius , but we shall see that even in this case when we have a manifold described as a _ product _ of spheres , the volume will _ not _ always be the product of the natural sphere volumes !    this volume problem has been dealt with in the published literature , both physical and mathematical .",
    "a fairly complete treatment for group manifolds is presented by marinov @xcite , corrected in @xcite ; the volume of the group is extracted from the propagator by an indirect ( and complicated ) method , in fact as a by - product of the author s study of curved path integrals @xcite . in macdonald @xcite",
    "there is a general synthetic formula for any compact lie group , with arbitrary scale , in terms of the root lattice ; we feel that most physicists will find these formulas hard to apply . for the unitary unimodular group @xmath10",
    "there is the very clear paper by c.  bernard @xcite .",
    "there are many other partial results in the physics literature , some of them contradictory .",
    "it was in an effort to overcome these difficulties that we undertook this investigation .",
    "a direct antecedent of our paper is the work of m.  byrd @xcite , who studied the @xmath11 case thoroughly . in a further paper",
    "we intend to look at the geometry of entangled states more closely @xcite ; see also the papers @xcite .",
    "we start by collecting some formulas for _ spheres _ , as the most symmetric spaces : the isometry group ( in physics , this is called the little group ) acts transitively in the bundle of bi - planes , and therefore the _ sectional _ curvature is constant .",
    "next is the case of _ projective _ spaces , in which the isometry group still acts transitively in the bundle of lines , and therefore the geodesics are all equal .",
    "compact _ group manifolds _ are symmetric spaces and therefore the curvature is covariantly constant . there is a natural metric ( induced from the killing form in the lie algebra ) which generates an invariant measure ( haar , or more appropriately hurwitz ) , but also there is a structure close to the product of odd spheres : the two criteria clash .",
    "the action of the group in the adjoint representation produces interesting orbits , the so - called _ generalized flag manifolds _ , which appear very often in geometric quantization , density matrices , entangled states , etc .",
    "we compute also the volumes of these quotient manifolds ; there are still symmetric , or at least homogeneous manifolds , and therefore the _ scalar _ curvature is still constant @xcite .",
    "the sphere @xmath12 is a maximally symmetric space ; in fact , the isometry group @xmath13 is transitive ( so spheres are homogeneous spaces ) and the isotropy group @xmath14 acts also _ trans _ ( from here on , we shall use _ trans _ for `` transitive '' ) in the unit tangent vectors ( hence permutes the geodesics , and all are equivalent , in particular closed with same length ) and also _ trans _ in the grassmannian of bi - planes ( hence the sectional curvature is constant , in particular the scalar curvature ) .",
    "we have @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the space of lines and @xmath17 that of bi - planes , in the tangent space to a point .",
    "the volume of the sphere of * unit radius * embedded in @xmath18 , @xmath19 , is calculated from the auxiliary formula @xmath20^n = \\pi^{\\frac{n}{2 } } = \\int_{0}^{\\infty } r^{n-1 } e^{-r^2 } dr \\times \\text{vol}(s^{n-1})\\ ] ] or @xmath21 for completeness we include a proof by induction . if @xmath12 is embedded in @xmath22 as the equator , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the latitude angle , with @xmath25 , we have for the metric @xmath26 we start by setting @xmath27 therefore as @xmath28 we find @xmath29 in particular @xmath30 explicit useful formulas for the even / odd cases are @xmath31 notice the volume is maximal for @xmath32 , and @xmath33 these `` volumes '' are numbers , they have no dimensions ( in hypersolid angles ) .",
    "our convention for the radius @xmath34 is _ extrinsic _ , that is , depends on the embedding @xmath35 ; an equivalent _ intrinsic _ criterion is the length of the geodesic : @xmath36 applicable because all geodesics in the sphere are equivalent ( see remarks above ) .",
    "notice also that the scalar curvature is @xmath37 = \\text{tr}[\\text{tr}[riemann ] ] = \\frac{n(n-1)}{r^2}\\ ] ] ( see @xcite ) , so @xmath38 is not a good scale as it depends on @xmath39 .",
    "finally the volume of the unit ball is @xmath40",
    "the projective spaces , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 share with the spheres the property of being two - point homogeneous spaces , or symmetric rank - one spaces @xcite : the isometry ( little ) groups act _ trans _ on directions , and hence permute the geodesics , which ( in the compact case ) would all have to be closed and of the same length .",
    "these spaces are of constant _ covariant _ curvature , as they are symmetric , but not of constant _ sectional _ curvature , except @xmath41 of course .",
    "one can see how the sectional curvature changes along the real bi - planes e.  g.  in @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "so we have a natural characterization for the scale of projective spaces : namely , the length of a fiducial geodesic .",
    "we shall define projective spaces as _ quotient of spheres _ , and we shall see that the natural scale for the geodesics is to have length @xmath46 , _ not _ @xmath47 as in the spheres .",
    "@xmath41 is defined as the set of rays or lines or one - dimensional sub - spaces in @xmath48 : @xmath49 there are many equivalent characterizations : @xmath50 any line touches the unit sphere in @xmath48 in the two anti - podal points , hence the first characterizations .",
    "the orthogonal group @xmath51 acts _ trans _ in the lines , with little group : stabilizer of a vector in @xmath52 times the two directions in @xmath53 , hence the last forms in equation .",
    "now we _ define _ the volume of @xmath41 as a quotient : @xmath54 but this implies that the geodesic length of _ our _ @xmath41 is @xmath46 and not @xmath47 because the half - meridian from the the north pole to the south pole is already _ closed _ in @xmath41 ! notice the halving of the volume for @xmath41 is really neglecting a set of measure zero , because @xmath41 as a half - sphere , still has the anti - podal points in the equator identified ; but this is a set of measure zero .",
    "thus we get @xmath55 , even though @xmath56 and @xmath57 : the radius has shrunk to 1/2 . the case @xmath58 is also interesting , because @xmath59 , and we shall discuss it later .",
    "notice also @xmath60 is not orientable , hence the volume has to be properly defined with the modulus of the measure .    for @xmath61 spaces ( the notation , due to besse @xcite",
    ", means @xmath62ompact , @xmath63ank-@xmath64ne , @xmath65ymmetric , @xmath65paces , precisely the sphere and the projective spaces ) a.  weinstein has established the following result @xcite , which we shall not prove but verify in many examples . if @xmath3 is a @xmath61 , dim @xmath66 , geodesic length=@xmath67 , then @xmath68 with equal normalization . for our case of real projective spaces",
    "we indeed get @xmath69 in agreement with besse @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 has the following definition : @xmath70 here the complex lines in @xmath71 intersect the unit sphere @xmath72 in @xmath73 along a maximal circle @xmath74 .",
    "we again _ define _ the volume of @xmath42 as a quotient @xmath75 using equation .",
    "again for @xmath76 we have @xmath77 , whereas @xmath78 , and @xmath79 : obviously the geodesic length of _ our _ @xmath80 is only @xmath46 , whereas the volume of the equivalent @xmath81 space is @xmath82 times as big : the quotient circle includes the anti - pode ( @xmath83 lies inside @xmath74 ) , hence the geodesics are halved .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath84    the weinstein integer for @xmath42 is also easy to compute : @xmath85 in full agreement with besse @xcite . for a thorough mathematical study of @xmath45 as an instanton see @xcite .",
    "@xmath43 has the following definition : let @xmath86 be the space of quaternions and @xmath87 the set of unit quaternions and @xmath88 , the symplectic group @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90 with the same definition as for @xmath91 or @xmath92 , we obtain @xmath93 with _ geodesic length _",
    "equal to @xmath46 .",
    "again @xmath87 contains the anti - podal point .",
    "we obtain @xmath94 , whereas @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in this case @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "the weinstein number is @xmath99 in full agreement with besse @xcite .      over the division algebra of the octonions @xmath100 ( or cayley numbers )",
    "there are only @xmath101 , which is equal to @xmath102 and @xmath44 ( the moufang plane ) , due to the non - associativity of the octonions ; and in fact , the definition is different . for example , @xmath44 is best defined as the hermitian , idempotent , trace - one elements of the exceptional 3x3 jordan algebra over the octonions @xcite .",
    "but the formulas work just as well and one can formally define : @xmath103 in fact , the only two cases are @xmath104 and @xmath105 @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the fourth hopf bundle @xcite , which is not principal ; for @xmath44 see @xcite .",
    "@xmath108 is the fifty - two dimensional second exceptional lie group .",
    "thus @xmath109 and @xmath110 we have weinstein integer @xmath111=1 obviously , and @xmath112 as it should @xcite .",
    "we have grouped the main results from sections [ sec : two ] and [ sec : three ] in table [ tbl : a ] :     @xmath34 & @xmath113 & maximally symmetric + & & geodesic length = @xmath47 & & + real projective & @xmath41 & geodesic length = @xmath46 & @xmath114 & compact , rank one , + & & & & symmetric space + & & & & [ @xmath61 ] + complex projective & @xmath42 & geodesic length = @xmath46 & @xmath116 & [ @xmath61 ] + quaternionic projective & @xmath43 & geodesic length = @xmath46 & @xmath117 & [ @xmath61 ] + moufang plane & @xmath44 & geodesic length = @xmath46 & @xmath118 & [ @xmath61 ] +",
    "group manifolds are still symmetric spaces ( i.  e.  with covariant constant curvature ) of rank @xmath121 1 .",
    "we start with the @xmath122 case which includes @xmath119 and @xmath123 which will reveal already some complications .    for @xmath124 : @xmath125 which implies @xmath126 and @xmath127 ;",
    "that is latexmath:[\\[\\label{fourtwo } u= \\begin{pmatrix } z_{1 } & z_{2 } \\\\ -z_{2}^ * & z_{1}^ * \\end{pmatrix } \\quad \\text{with } \\quad     is identical with @xmath87 _",
    "( this statement becomes tautological through the equivalence @xmath129 or @xmath130 in lie algebra notation ) .",
    "it is instructive to compute now the volume ; write @xmath131 and @xmath132 where the ranges are @xmath133 and @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 .",
    "so @xmath137 to calculate the volume , write @xmath138 thus the line element is @xmath139 with @xmath140 giving of course @xmath141 for the ranges given in equations and .",
    "we carried out this elementary calculation because the parameterization was different than the one used in equations and ( [ eq : twofive ] ) .",
    "a compact group manifold @xmath142 has a natural measure , namely the bi - invariant haar measure ( any locally compact space has a natural left - invariant haar measure , unique up to a constant ; for compact groups , in which the volume is finite , the name hurwitz measure is more appropriate ) .    the simplest way to measure _ invariantly _",
    "the volume of @xmath119 is to start from the cartan - killing metric in the lie algebra @xmath143 of @xmath142 @xmath144 ; \\quad \\text{for } x , y \\in l(\\euscript{g})\\ ] ] and to induce , by the exponential map @xmath145 , a riemannian metric on @xmath142 , and hence a finite volume element as @xmath142 is always orientable as a manifold ( in particular it is parallelizable ) and compact .",
    "one can use any representation @xmath146 instead of the adjoint ( ad ) .    let us work with the @xmath142-invariant metric for @xmath147 and see if it coincides with the embedding metric as @xmath148 .",
    "we start now from the `` euler '' form in the _ defining representation _ @xmath149 we need to fix the ranges of the angles @xmath150 and @xmath151 ; the safest way is to convert equation to the form given in equation , namely expanding equation with @xmath152 @xmath153 and comparing with equation we obtain @xmath154 the range of @xmath155 is _ half _ of the range @xmath156 and the jacobian is @xmath157 this is seen also directly from equation ( [ eq : fourtwelve ] ) : @xmath158 we therefore can choose to write equation as @xmath159    to compute now the volume we proceed as in @xcite :    1 .",
    "compute @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) in terms of the @xmath162 s and @xmath163 from equation ; that is , express the holonomic vector fields @xmath164 ( @xmath161 ) in terms of the _ invariant _ anholonomic vector fields @xmath165 .",
    "invert , to express the invariant frame in terms of the coordinate frame .",
    "dualize , to express the invariant co - frame in terms of the one - forms @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "4 .   express the volume element as the determinant ( jacobian ) of the change of frames .",
    "this is a standard procedure , it is carried out in detail e.  g.  in @xcite , and the net result is @xmath169 integration with respect to the ranges given in equation , yields @xmath170 notice the @xmath171 missing in equation as compared with equation ( [ eq : foureight ] ) is compensated with the halving of parameter ranges for @xmath172 .",
    "so the _ invariant _ volume coincides with the _ embedding _ volume .",
    "now @xmath119 has a center @xmath173 , and in fact @xmath174 also @xmath175 , as it is obvious from @xmath176 .",
    "so let us work the @xmath120 case .",
    "for @xmath177 we write the `` euler '' formula , namely @xmath178 where we are in the _ adjoint representation _ , e.  g.@xmath179 etc .",
    "it is well known ( e.  g. @xcite p.  24 ) that the ranges are @xmath180 we compute the volume as before , starting with @xmath181 , etc .",
    "the final result is @xmath182 ( see e.  g.  @xcite p.  58 ) , and the volume is @xmath183 this is the correct volume for @xmath184 with geodesic length @xmath47 , which is our case . from equation , we had obtained @xmath185 with geodesic length equal to @xmath46 .",
    "one might wonder the factor of 2 difference in the angles from equation , namely @xmath186 and here from equation , namely @xmath187 ; it is due to the change of generators : with the @xmath162 s we have @xmath188=2 i \\sigma_z$ ] , but with the @xmath189 s implicit in equation the relation is the usual one @xmath190 = i j_z$ ] .",
    "notice also the weinstein number @xmath191 : for equal length geodesics which is our case , we have @xmath192 .",
    "a lie group @xmath142 is a symmetric space , @xmath193 , and hence of constant scalar curvature ; for rank @xmath194 the geodesics depend on directions , in fact they can be dense , as _ it is already the case _ for the torus @xmath195 .",
    "another normalization is necessary though . let us start with @xmath11 .",
    "in the vector , or defining representation , @xmath11 acts in @xmath196 , the action being _ trans _ in the invariant unit sphere @xmath197 with the isotropy subgroup @xmath119 @xmath198 the latter is a principal fibre bundle , in fact , _ locally _ one certainly has @xmath199 but the _ invariant _ volume is not quite the product of the volumes of the spheres . for many purposes ,",
    "any compact lie group can be expressed as a ( finitely twisted ) topological product of odd - dimensional spheres . for a discussion of this point see @xcite .",
    "consider the vector * * v**=@xmath200 ; it describes the whole of @xmath201 by actions of @xmath11 ; the infinitesimal transformation is @xmath202 where @xmath203 ( @xmath204 ) are the gell - mann matrices for su(3 ) which satisfy @xmath205=2\\delta_{ij}.\\ ] ]    on the other hand , if we describe a point in @xmath201 with locally flat infinitesimal coordinates , we would then have a jacobian between the _ invariant _ coordinates @xmath206 and the _ sphere _ coordinates @xmath207 ; in fact @xmath208 the detailed calculation is in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath209 is just the `` stretching '' ( actually , contracting ) of the @xmath210 due to :    1 .   commuting with @xmath211 and 2 .",
    "satisfying equation .",
    "the matrix representation of @xmath210 is necessarily then @xmath212 in other words : for calculating the _ invariant volume _ it is better to think of the second sphere @xmath201 as being `` stretched '' along a _",
    "axis by the factor @xmath209 .",
    "therefore , _ with our trace normalization _ ( equation ) the volume of @xmath11 is @xmath213 which is in agreement with _",
    "most _ of the physics literature , e.  g. @xcite .",
    "if we parameterize a generic element of @xmath11 as @xcite @xmath214 one set of ranges of the @xmath215 s that reproduce equation is @xcite @xmath216    @xmath11 embodies all the complications for the @xmath10 series , the calculation of @xmath217 in terms of @xmath218 by induction is now a straightforward matter .    for @xmath10 write @xmath219",
    "the `` stretching '' relative to @xmath218 occurs again _ only _ in the `` last '' @xmath203 @xmath220 where @xmath221 = 2 $ ] implies @xmath222 and therefore @xmath223 an `` invariant '' way of calculating the `` stretching '' is this : write density matrices for @xmath10 as @xmath224 where @xmath225 and the @xmath226 s satisfy equation .",
    "we have @xmath227=1 $ ] ; for pure states @xmath228 and imposing @xmath229=1 $ ] we obtain @xmath230 so the final formula for @xmath10 turns out to be @xmath231 where we have used @xmath232 in the last step .",
    "equation ( [ eq : fiveeleven ] ) agrees with the corrected volume in @xcite and with @xcite interpreting his scale @xmath226 ( the lebesgue measure in @xmath233 ) as our `` stretching '' factors ; it agrees also with @xcite . on the contrary , a classical textbook @xcite , and a recent paper @xcite",
    "omit these `` stretching '' factors .    for the full unitary group @xmath234",
    "there is a _ topological _ direct product decomposition @xmath235 which can be seen , for example , by factorizing a phase in the first vector component : @xmath236 the volume of @xmath234 thus _ depends on the radius _ of the @xmath237 factor ; if it is @xmath122 , i.  e.  not stretched , then @xmath238 finally , for the projective unitary group @xmath239 we obtain , as @xmath240 @xmath241",
    "for the _ orthogonal groups _ @xmath52 and @xmath242 we shall proceed in a similar manner ; the rotation group @xmath242 acting on the vector representation leaves the unit sphere , @xmath243 , invariant with the isometry group @xmath244 : @xmath245 in fact equation is the principal bundle of the tangent to the sphere @xcite .",
    "there is no `` stretching '' factor with the lie algebra convention in the _ vector _ representation @xmath246 = 2\\delta_{ij}\\ ] ] because the lie algebra of @xmath242 is comprised of antisymmetric matrices , always of the type @xmath247 = 2.\\ ] ] therefore the volume calculation is elementary , because the spheres act like those with radius one .",
    "induction starts at @xmath248 .",
    "of course @xmath249 and we have @xmath250 which , e.  g. gives @xmath251 which is the same value as in equation . for n",
    "even / odd we get @xmath252 and @xmath253 in agreement with @xcite , and also with @xcite once a trivial factor of 2 is corrected in the even case",
    ". however we disagree with @xcite .",
    "the orthogonal group is neither connected nor simply connected ; so we have @xmath254 where @xmath255 is the universal double covering of the rotation group ( @xmath256 ) .",
    "so we obviously obtain the result @xmath257 notice the first equation implies a topological direct product @xmath258 .",
    "in fact , for odd @xmath39 , this is a direct product of groups .",
    "notice also that @xmath259 has center @xmath173 , therefore the number of central elements in @xmath260 is @xmath261 , with two classes : @xmath262 there are no irreducible _ faithful _ representations of @xmath263 , so the spin group is represented through @xmath264 , which corresponds to @xmath265 and @xmath266 , the two chiral _ irreps _ , and @xmath267 which is the vector representation . in particular , there are _ three _ subgroups in the center of @xmath263 of type @xmath173 .",
    "this explains triality for @xmath268 , because then @xmath269 .    for the case",
    "@xmath270 we have something interesting .",
    "we compute @xmath271 whereas @xmath272 even though @xmath273 ! the `` stretching '' factor is the culprit , of course .    for the _ symplectic groups _ @xmath88",
    "the story is pretty much the same , but now the spheres jump by four : first of all @xmath274 with volume @xmath275 ( see equation ) .",
    "now the induction is based in the fact that @xmath88 acts in @xmath276 unitarily , and therefore @xmath277 and it is easily seen that the action on the sphere is _ trans _ with isotropy group @xmath278 . therefore @xmath279 and therefore @xmath280 it can also been seen that there is no `` stretching '' in the lie algebra matrices of @xmath88 ( @xcite , p.  188 ) ; the reason is the same as for the orthogonal group .    from equations and we obtain @xmath281 in full agreement with @xcite and @xcite . in this case , the product of spheres @xmath282 is both topological and metric , with radius one spheres .",
    "in particular we obtain @xmath283 whereas before we obtained @xmath284 but @xmath285 , corresponding to cartan s @xmath286 .",
    "it is remarkable that the _ same _ normalization , i.  e.  @xmath287 = 2 $ ] produces such different volumes in similar groups .",
    "the reason is , of course , that the normalization is performed in _",
    "different _ representations .    as for the _ exceptional groups _ we just want to add formulas for the two first cases only , namely @xmath288 and @xmath108 .",
    "the groups in the @xmath289-series , @xmath290 , although fundamental in @xmath291-theory , are yet to be fully understood .",
    "now @xmath288 can be _ defined _ as the automorphism group of the octonions , or cayley numbers , @xmath100 .",
    "the reals @xmath292 are of course invariant and so is the norm : @xmath293 therefore @xmath288 leaves the set of unit , imaginary , octonions @xmath32 invariant .",
    "one can see also that the action is _ trans _ with isotropy equal to @xmath11 ( e.  g.  @xcite ) : @xmath294 so we obtain @xmath295 leaving aside a scale factor @xmath296 .    as for @xmath108",
    ", it can be _ defined _ as the isometry group of the cayley - moufang plane @xmath44 ; the dimension of @xmath108 is 52 and the little group is @xmath297 @xmath298 as shown in @xcite .",
    "so the volume is @xmath299 where we have used equations , and have left a free normalization constant @xmath296 .",
    "we have collected some of more important volumes in the following table :     equation ( [ eq : fiveeleven ] ) + @xmath234 & @xmath287=2 $ ] & equation + @xmath259 & & equation + @xmath300 & & equation + @xmath88 & & equation ( [ eq : sixfifteen ] ) +",
    "states of quantum systems are generally elements of some homogeneous manifold , @xmath301 . for example , pure states lie in @xmath302 , the infinite projective space ; if attention is directed to a finite number of independent states , as it is the case in quantum computing , encryption , entanglement considerations , etc .",
    "the appropriate frame is a _",
    "finite _ dimensional hilbert space , let us say @xmath71 .",

    "the following is to be noticed in the general case @xmath333 :    1 .",
    "all these manifolds are homogeneous manifolds , hence they have constant scalar curvature ( except @xmath334 , of course , which is just a point ) .",
    "spaces of the type @xmath335 are called `` grassmannian . ''",
    "explicitly , @xmath17 is the complex grassmannian of @xmath336-planes in @xmath337 , to wit @xmath338 ( other labels , such as @xmath339 are also used ) .",
    "in particular @xmath340    we already used the grassmannian notation , @xmath341 in section [ sec : two ] .",
    "we shall define these orbits of the unitary group in the adjoint representation as _ generalized flag manifolds _ following an extended mathematical usage .",
    "the genuine flag manifold corresponds to the @xmath342 $ ] partition : @xmath343 they enjoy interesting mathematical properties ; for example , they are spin and khler manifolds , in particular symplectic ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the simplest space @xmath344 appears as a space of exceptional holonomy @xcite .",
    "we come now to the question of the _ volumes of the generalized flag manifolds _ ; because they are always _ homogeneous _ manifolds , @xmath301 , the volume is , of course , @xmath345 but , appearances to the contrary , this does not `` cut too much ice '' because the volume of @xmath346 depends on which subgroup it is identified with !",
    "we illustrate the case @xmath58 ( @xmath248 is trivial ) , before attacking the more general case .",
    "we have @xmath347 now @xmath348 also , removing the same @xmath237 factor , and @xmath349 ; this @xmath237 factor is `` the long one '' in @xmath45 , if one remembers that @xmath350 , so @xmath351 and the `` last '' lambda , @xmath210 is of the form diag@xmath352 .",
    "the @xmath237 group , in this case , has the `` stretching '' factor @xmath209 ( see section [ sec : five ] ) ; hence @xmath353 which coincides with the canonical volume for @xmath45 from equation .",
    "for the flag manifold we have @xmath354 thus @xmath355 which coincides , as in the @xmath45 case with the `` naive '' calculation without `` stretching '' @xmath356 now the same the result holds in _ all _ generality for the generalized flag manifolds ! the `` naive '' calculation ( i.  e.  neglecting the `` stretching '' factors ) _ gives the correct results_. that is @xmath357 the reason is as follows : both the numerator and the denominator in equation have the same rank ! therefore , the dimension of the cartan subgroups , in fact the cartan subgroups @xmath358 , @xmath359 , up to @xmath360 are _ exactly _ the same in the numerator and the denominator , so the `` stretching '' factors themselves cancel completely , and the calculation is thus reduced to the one with the other odd spheres only ( starting from @xmath87 ) .",
    "so there is nothing else to calculate : for the generic flag manifold the computation is @xmath361 where @xmath362 that the generalized flag manifolds have homology of the product of projective spaces times spheres can be proved easily @xcite from equation .    with not too much extra effort we can extend our results to generalized _ real _",
    "flag manifolds : there are no `` stretching '' factors at all ! we refrain to give explicit formulas , other than to remark that in @xmath363 the volumes are computed from the volumes of the corresponding orthogonal groups from section [ sec : six ] with no corrections .",
    "we hope our normalization conventions are plausible and our volume computations useful ; as we said in the introduction , there are many different results written in the literature .",
    "we have not tried to state the conventions ( and , in some cases , the mistakes ) of all the authors ; rather we have attempted to produce a self - consistent , and uniform way of looking at the volumes of compact groups and some quotient spaces .    except for spheres",
    ", we do nt worry much about parameterizations of manifolds ; for @xmath364 see the explicit calculations in @xcite    there are a few points that have been left out , that we want to recall .",
    "we have not attempted to calculate the canonical volume for the @xmath365 groups , as the defining realizations are rather obscure .",
    "we share the belief @xcite that these groups have to be better understood before attempting such a calculation .",
    "also , the exact _ algebraic _ characterization of density matrices ( e.  g.  equation ) is not done , except in the simplest case of @xmath248 , for then @xmath366 for @xmath256 , the generic class is the flag manifold with the matrices congruent to @xmath367 and the positivity condition is @xmath368 or , in terms of the minors , @xmath369 which give rise to complicated algebraic restrictions that we shall not try to pursue further in this paper .",
    "finally , see the recent paper @xcite which attempts to calculate the volumes of some compact einstein manifolds which appear in @xmath291-theory .",
