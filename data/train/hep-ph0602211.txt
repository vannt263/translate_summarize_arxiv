    "in spite of the success of the standard model ( sm ) in describing all the existing experimental data , the higgs boson , which is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism in the sm , is yet - to - be found at the current fermilab tevatron run ii and cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments .",
    "the elementary higgs boson in the sm has a difficulty dubbed as `` naturalness problem '' , i.e. , its mass parameter can receive huge radiative corrections so that it is difficult to understand why its mass is at the electroweak scale , in contrast to the more fundamental scale , say , planck scale . solving the naturalness problem",
    "has been one of the driving forces to consider physics models beyond the sm .",
    "supersymmetry  @xcite is one of the attractive solutions to this problem .",
    "all the quadratic divergences in the higgs mass parameter induced by the sm particles in loops are canceled by those induced by the loops of superpartners of sm particles , and hence the electroweak scale higgs boson mass parameter is protected from large radiative corrections .",
    "little higgs mechanism  @xcite provides another interesting solution .",
    "especially , the large correction induced by top - quark is canceled by that from the heavy fermionic partner of the top - quark , which is originated from the structure of the approximate global symmetry in the top - sector .",
    "similarly , the quadratic divergence in the gauge - boson loops is canceled by that from the extra heavy gauge - bosons which are the partners of sm gauge bosons .    in order to cancel",
    "the large quadratic divergence of the higgs mass parameter , one in general has to introduce new interactions with the higgs boson .",
    "therefore , studying the consequence of these new higgs boson interactions would be very important for understanding if such a cancellation is really happening .",
    "the new higgs boson interaction most likely affects @xmath6 production process where the top - higgs interaction at one - loop level plays a crucial role .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the heavy fermionic partner of top - quark could modify the higgs boson production rate via gluon - gluon ( @xmath0 ) fusion process in little higgs models .",
    "although many little higgs models suffer from strong constraints from precision electroweak measurements  @xcite , recent studies in refs .",
    "@xcite have shown that littlest higgs models  @xcite with t - parity have weaker constraints , and therefore the new particle scale can be significantly smaller than 1 tev .    in this letter , we point out that there are other sets of new higgs boson interactions in a certain class of little higgs models with t - parity . they are needed to generate mass terms for fermionic t - parity partners of the sm fermions , and they can significantly modify the production and decay of higgs boson at high energy colliders such as the tevatron and the lhc . the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2 , we briefly review the model we study here ; a littlest higgs model with t - parity . in sec .  3",

    "the sm gauge fields are defined as the t - even combination of these gauge fields and the heavy extra gauge bosons are odd under t - parity .",
    "since t - parity is an exact symmetry in this model , the sm gauge bosons do not mix with the t - odd heavy gauge bosons , and consequently , the electroweak precision observables are not modified at tree level . beyond tree level , small radiative corrections induced by the model to precision data still allow the scale @xmath12 to be significantly lower than 1 tev  @xcite .",

    ", the @xmath229 decay mode of higgs boson produced via @xmath0 fusion is one of the important discovery channels for a light higgs boson with mass around 100 gev .",
    "however , in the lh model that we study here , this mode would be strongly suppressed .",
    "for example , @xmath230 for @xmath225 gev and @xmath198 gev in case a ( case b ) , as shown in table 1 . note that since the @xmath231 decay branching ratio is enhanced in case b , @xmath232 is not suppressed as largely as in case a. the similar conclusion also holds for the @xmath233 mode . on the other hand , @xmath212 and @xmath213 decay modes of higgs boson produced via weak boson fusion will be quite different from that via @xmath0 fusion since the weak boson fusion process is not largely suppressed . in case a , @xmath234 is very close to the sm prediction . in case b , however , it could be significantly enhanced because of the enhancement of the @xmath212 decay branching ratio .",
    "the decay branching ratio to @xmath202 decay mode and the higgs boson production rate via weak boson fusion do not change in either case a or case b. thus , @xmath235 is close to the sm prediction .",
    "when higgs mass is relatively heavy ( @xmath236 gev ) , the decay mode to gauge bosons ( @xmath233 ( @xmath140 ) ) becomes important .",
    "since in both case a and case b the branching ratio for @xmath233 ( @xmath140 ) is almost the same as the sm prediction , the @xmath213 decay mode via gluon fusion production is significantly suppressed , but that via weak boson fusion is not .",
    "therefore , typically the discovery modes of higgs boson produced via weak boson fusion processes will become more important in the lh model than in the sm . since these effects could be larger than the experimental uncertainties",
    "@xmath237  @xcite on the measurement of the higgs boson production cross sections times the branching ratios , they could be observable at the lhc .",
    "we note that when the scale @xmath12 is around 1 tev , the t - odd heavy gauge boson masses can be of @xmath238 gev .",
    "for example , for @xmath198 gev , the t - odd @xmath239 ( @xmath240 ) and @xmath21 ( @xmath241 and @xmath242 ) gauge boson masses are @xmath243 gev and @xmath244 gev , respectively . when the higgs mass is larger than twice of these masses , higgs boson can decay into the heavy gauge boson pair .",
    "we have checked that in that case the decay branching ratios of the heavy gauge boson pair are less than @xmath245 for @xmath246 gev .",
    "therefore , the extra higgs decay modes does not significantly change the branching ratios of the sm higgs boson decay modes .    as discussed in previous sections ,",
    "the higgs boson production rate via @xmath6 process in the littlest higgs model with t - parity strongly depends on the mechanism to give t - odd particles ( and other additional extra - particles ) heavy masses .",
    "thus the prediction may be sensitive to new physics above the cutoff scale , and our result shows that the effect could be quite large and become observable at the lhc . therefore",
    ", searching for higgs boson in various detection modes at the lhc is very important , and the measurement of the relative event rates in multi - channels could reveal the mechanism which provides the cancellation of the quadratic divergence of the higgs mass parameter and the origin of mass terms for the extra heavy fermions in the lh model .",
