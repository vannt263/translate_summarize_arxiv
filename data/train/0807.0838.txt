    "ion transport through the channels in cellular membranes underlies the electrical signal transduction and processing by living organisms . accordingly ion channels , being natural nanotubes , control a vast range of biological functions in health and disease .",
    "the understanding of their structure - properties relationship is the subject of intensive , ever - growing , fundamental and applied research in biology , physics , and nanotechnology  @xcite .",
    "a central problem in studies of ion permeation through biological membrane channels is to understand how channels can be both highly selective between alike ions and yet still conduct millions of ions per second  @xcite .",
    "indeed , selectivity between ions of the same charge implies that there exists a deep potential well for conducting type ions at the selectivity site of the channel . on the other hand",
    "such channels can pass up to 10@xmath0 ions per second  @xcite corresponding to almost free diffusion .",
    "significant progress has been made towards an understanding of this problem over the last few decades .",
    "in particular , the molecular structure of the kcsa potassium channel  @xcite that discriminates between na@xmath1 and k@xmath1 was determined by crystallographic analysis .",
    "furthermore , by detecting the size of the structural fluctuations  @xcite and conformational changes  @xcite , it has become possible to provide the experimental information needed for molecular modelling of the dynamical features of the observed selectivity and gating  @xcite . in particular , the minimum radius of the selectivity filter in kcsa is @xmath20.85 , which is to be compared with 1.33 for the ionic radius of k@xmath1 , suggesting that flexibility of the filter is coupled to ionic translocation  @xcite .",
    "it has therefore become apparent that fluctuations in the channel walls plays a fundamental role in maintaining high conductivity in highly selective channels ( see also elber  @xcite ) .",
    "another important source of modulation of the electrostatic potential identified in earlier research  @xcite relates to the interaction of the ion in the channel with charge fluctuations in the bath solutions .",
    "the effect of current fluctuations and noise on the channel entrance rates and on the channel conductivity was also considered in  @xcite .",
    "it becomes clear that fluctuations of the electrostatic potential within ion channels induced by various sources may provide a key to the solution of the central problems of permeation and selectivity .",
    "models of such fluctuations have thus become one of the central topics of research on the permeability of ion channels .",
    "it is important to note that dynamical models of ion motion in the channel can also provide a link between studies of the permeability of open channels and channels gating . notwithstanding recent advances ,",
    "theoretical modeling of the dynamical features of ion channels is still in its infancy . in particular ,",
    "little is yet known about the relative importance of the different dynamical mechanisms and sources of fluctuations in the ion channels .    in our earlier work",
    "we have started to develop a dynamical model  @xcite of ionic conductivity through open channels .",
    "it takes into account the coupling of ion motion to vibrations of the wall  @xcite and to charge fluctuations at the channel mouth  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to derive a self - consistent model that allows for analytical estimation of the potential barrier at the selectivity site and for the effects of fluctuations on the conductivity of the channels .",
    "the starting point of our approach is a self - consistent quasi - analytical solution of the poisson and nernst - planck equations in the channel , and in the bulk  @xcite , allowing for accurate estimation of the current - voltage characteristics of ion channels  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the electrostatic channel potentials resulting from these estimates can be further used to estimate relative contribution to the channel conductivity from the different sources of fluctuations .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a model of ion permeation that takes into account dynamical effect of the charge fluctuations through the resultant shot noise , and we demonstrate that the latter has a leading - order effect on the transition probabilities . we show that the charge fluctuations at the channel mouth can be modeled as a flipping of the electrostatic potential at the selectivity site , which fluctuates between two maximum values at a rate corresponding to the random arrivals of ions at the channel mouth",

    "these findings have allowed us to model the mean ion transition time through the channel as an ionic escape from the potential wall at the selectivity site induced by thermal fluctuations and by modulation of the height of the barrier by stochastic poisson processes .",

    "such an escape process , assisted by the periodic modulation of the potential barrier by the wall oscillations , can result on its own in selectivity between alike ions due to the difference in their diffusion coefficients  @xcite .",
    "however , ultimately the selectivity of the channel has to be incorporated into the model by taking into account the effects of hydration  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a discussion of how hydration effect can be incorporated in our model ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the model that takes into account fluctuations of the wall may account for the dissipation of energy in the channel , for self - induced acceleration of the transition rate of the ion through the channel , and for coupling of the ion motion to the channel gating mechanics . indeed , in this model ,",
    "part of the energy induced by a very strong coulomb interaction between the charged site at the channel wall and the moving ion is stored as the energy of vibrational modes .",
    "the later energy is only partially dissipated by the protein phonon modes .",
    "the remaining energy can now be used to modulate the potential barrier for the moving ion in a self - consistent manner to accelerate its transition through the channel .",
    "it can also be used to assist the conformational changes leading to the channel gating .",
    "the work in progress contains a plethora of unsolved problems .",
    "the immediate extension of the proposed model will be to include more then two levels for the potential at the selectivity site , taking into account positive , neutral , and negative charge at the channel mouths at both ends of the channel . the model can be further refined by including the estimates of the return times corresponding to a return of the ion in the channel to the initial bulk solution .",
    "following the discussion above we can also formulate the following general unsolved problems in ion channels .",
    "we believe that they can be tackled by extending the model introduced in this paper :    * the role of the membrane fluctuations . * the role of the hydration potential . *",
    "the role of additional binding sites outside the selectivity filter . * the energetics of the ion transition including energy relaxation due to the coupling to the protein phonon modes ( wall oscillations ) . * the coupling of the ion - wall interaction to the gating mechanism .    in all of these ,",
    "noise and dynamical effects seem to play a crucial role that is only starting to be elucidated .",
