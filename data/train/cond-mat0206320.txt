    "athermal mixtures are remarkable because the only energy they possess is thermal energy ; their behaviour including their phase behaviour is determined solely by entropy . but this does not mean that this phase behaviour is uninteresting , entropy alone can drive phase transitions such as freezing and , in mixtures , demixing into coexisting fluid phases .",
    "this demixing is found almost whenever the two components of the mixture are very different , such as the athermal polymer and hard spheres considered here .",
    "we look at mixtures of hard spheres and athermal polymer where the polymer is as large or larger than the spheres : the mean - square end - to - end separation of the polymer greater than or equal to the diameter of the spheres .",
    "this complements earlier work on mixtures where the polymer is smaller .",
    "as might be expected we find extensive immiscibility between the polymer and the spheres .",
    "we calculate phase boundaries and determine their scaling with the sizes of the components , for example , the density of monomers at the critical point is found to scale as one over the square root of the number of monomers in a polymer , just as does the critical point for demixing of a polymer and a poor solvent .",
    "we are most interested in the limit where the size of the polymer , @xmath0 , is much greater than that of the colloid , @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath0 is the root - mean - square end - to - end distance of the polymer , and @xmath1 is the hard - sphere diameter .",
    "our theory is motivated by the idea that for @xmath2 the effect of the colloids is a small length - scale effect in the sense that if the colloid degrees of freedom of the mixture are integrated out we are left with polymers which at length - scales large in comparison to @xmath1 behave qualitatively just like a polymer in structureless solvent . the colloids effect the quality of this effective structureless solvent but do not introduce any new physics on length - scales large with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "if this is correct then the long length - scale behaviour and the phase behaviour , of colloid - polymer mixtures may be mapped onto the well - understood long length - scale and phase behaviour of a polymer plus solvent system .",
    "the phase separation of polymer and much smaller colloidal spheres will be qualitatively identical to that of a long polymer and a poor solvent . this phase separation has been extensively studied and is quite well understood @xcite .",
    "the approximate theory we will develop is essentially a flory - huggins polymer - plus - solvent free energy with an effective solvent quality which depends on the concentration of the colloid .",
    "it is known that a flory - huggins free energy describes rather well the qualitative features of the phase separation of a long polymer and a poor solvent ; see the comparison with computer simulation data in refs .",
    "it is also known that purely entropic effects can result in the polymer effectively being in a poor solvent @xcite .",
    "the literature on mixtures of colloidal particles and non - adsorbing polymers is extensive because colloid - polymer mixtures are common , and the limit we consider where all interactions are purely repulsive is a rather fundamental limit of these mixtures .",
    "mixtures in which the polymer molecules are both larger than the particles and flexible ( as opposed to semiflexible ) are formed when the particles are small , a few nms across .",
    "nanoparticles are colloidal particles of this size as are proteins .",
    "protein - polymer mixtures are common , for example polymers are mixed with proteins in order to induce the proteins to crystallise @xcite .",
    "although in practice it is unlikely that the monomer - protein interaction is ever purely repulsive over all the surface of a protein , however the limit we study here provides a basis for incorporating the effects of weak adsorption of the polymer onto a protein molecule .",
    "the limit in which all three interactions , sphere - sphere , monomer - monomer and sphere - monomer , are purely repulsive is an important and fundamental limit .",
    "it is fundamental in the sense that as we are assuming the monomers to be much smaller than the spheres , then the details of the monomer - sphere interaction are irrelevant as long as it is purely repulsive ; the details of the monomer - monomer interaction only effect the behaviour by altering a single parameter , the monomer - monomer second virial coefficient , and any sharply repulsive sphere - sphere interaction will behave almost like hard spheres .",
    "thus many of the details of the mixture are irrelevant .",
    "the interactions between colloidal spheres and polymer molecules have been studied theoretically via a number of techniques : scaling approaches @xcite , field theory @xcite , computer simulation @xcite , integral equations @xcite , and other approaches @xcite .",
    "the phase behaviour has been studied via computer simulation @xcite , scaling theory @xcite , and perturbation theory @xcite , where refs .",
    "@xcite are for ideal polymers .",
    "reference @xcite is a review of recent work on colloid - polymer mixtures , focusing mainly on the structure and on the results of integral equations , but also discussing other approaches and the phase behaviour .",
    "earlier work by the author @xcite assumed that the phase separation would occur when the polymer was semidilute .",
    "the more careful and better founded work here finds that this is not correct , the phase separation occurs at the boundary between the dilute and semidilute regimes where the free energy expression assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite is not valid .",
    "therefore , in particular the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite for the polymer density where phase separation occurs are incorrect and should be discounted .",
    "the opposite limit to that of interest here , i.e. , where the polymer molecules are smaller than the colloidal spheres , has been considered extensively , see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein . in this limit",
    "the polymer ( with or without monomer - monomer excluded volume interactions ) induces crystallisation of the spheres , there is no equilibrium separation into coexisting fluids .",
    "our colloidal particles are modeled by hard spheres of diameter @xmath1 and our polymers are modeled by flexible chains of @xmath3 monomers , each of length @xmath4 .",
    "we characterise the interaction between a pair of monomers of the polymer with a second virial coefficient for this interaction , @xmath5 .",
    "we start with a polymer in a good solvent far from the theta temperature where @xmath6 and the polymer behaves as a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) . the interaction between a pair of hard spheres is similarly characterised by its second virial coefficient @xmath7 .",
    "the interaction between a sphere and a monomer is taken to be purely repulsive and short range , a monomer can not overlap with a sphere but otherwise does not interact with it .",
    "the polymers do not adsorb onto the surface of the spheres .",
    "the monomer size @xmath4 is much smaller than the diameter of the spheres , and here we are considering particles which are smaller than the polymers so our three length - scales satisfy @xmath8 .",
    "a mixture of spheres and polymer is difficult to deal with because of the sphere - polymer interaction .",
    "pure hard spheres and pure polymers have both been studied extensively and the equilibrium behaviour of both is well understood .",
    "the sphere - polymer interaction is hard to deal with because of the large difference between the size of a sphere and that of a monomer and because of the connectivity of the polymer  if the interaction of a sphere and a monomer was independent of the interaction of the sphere with the next monomer along the polymer , then the sphere - polymer interaction could be estimated easily . however ,",
    "when the monomers are much smaller than the sphere this is very far from being true .",
    "the problem of the disparity in sizes can be solved by rescaling the monomer size from @xmath4 to @xmath1 , i.e. , by viewing the polymer not as being composed of @xmath3 monomers of size @xmath4 but of @xmath9 monomers of size @xmath1 .",
    "this rescaling is quite common , see the book of de gennes @xcite .",
    "it has already been applied to mixtures of ideal large polymers and spheres @xcite , where it was referred to as the extended asakura - oosawa model .",
    "we call the rescaled monomers of size @xmath1 , blobs . in principle",
    "this rescaling can be done exactly , i.e. , it can be done leaving the free energy etc .",
    "exact , but here we view it as part of a physically motivated approximation scheme .",
    "see fig .  [ model ] for a schematic of our sphere - polymer mixture showing the polymer composed of a chain of blobs of size @xmath1 .",
    "if there are @xmath10 monomers of size @xmath4 in one blob of size @xmath1 then @xmath9 is related to @xmath3 by @xmath11 .",
    "so , relating the number of blobs to the number of monomers requires estimating @xmath10 , we defer this to section [ secsq ] .",
    "until then we specify the polymer size by specifying @xmath9 and do not concern ourselves with how @xmath9 is found for a given polymer .",
    "the approximate free energy we will obtain depends on the polymer length only through @xmath9 .",
    "having performed the rescaling we approximate the interaction between a sphere and a polymer as being @xmath9 independent sphere - blob interactions .",
    "this is quite a reasonable approximation as the blobs and spheres are of the same size .",
    "applying this approximation before rescaling , i.e. , approximating the sphere - polymer interaction by @xmath3 sphere - monomer interaction is qualitatively wrong because the monomers are so much smaller than the sphere so the sphere interacts with many monomers at a time .",
    "we rescaled the monomers just so we could apply this simplifying approximation .",
    "the blob - blob and sphere - blob interactions are characterised by their second virial coefficients , @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the second virial coefficient for the interaction between a sphere and a blob is of order that for the interaction between two hard spheres of diameter @xmath1 but is a little smaller .",
    "we defer its estimation to section [ secsq ] . returning to our assumption that the interaction between a polymer and a sphere consists of @xmath9 independent blob - sphere interactions",
    ", this implies that the second virial coefficient for the sphere - polymer interactions is @xmath14 . finally , we remark that after rescaling , our mixture of polymers of blobs and spheres resembles the athermal polymer + solvent mixture considered by frenkel and louis @xcite . the phase separation in both cases",
    "is driven by unfavourable excluded volume interactions .",
    "we start with the basic flory - huggins theory for a polymer of monomers which interact only via excluded volume interactions , see for example the book of de gennes , pages 113 - 115 .",
    "this is often referred to as an athermal polymer solution . for",
    "our ` monomers ' we take the blobs not the original monomers of length @xmath4 .",
    "thus the ` monomer ' density in the theory is actually the density of blobs which is equal to @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is the number density of polymer molecules . as usual",
    "we use a reduced ` monomer ' density , @xmath17 , which we obtain by multiplying the blob number density by the volume one blob excludes to another , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the flory - huggins helmholtz free energy @xmath20 then has the usual form @xmath21 which defines the reduced helmholtz free energy per unit volume @xmath22 . throughout",
    ", we use units such that the thermal energy @xmath23 .",
    "this is for a polymer solution , no colloidal spheres present .",
    "we add on the contribution of the colloidal spheres using a virial expansion , @xmath24 + \\rho_c^2b_s+\\rho_c\\rho_pn_bb_{sb } \\right\\},\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{flory_mix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have truncated the expansion after the second virial coefficient terms .",
    "we have dropped cubic and higher order terms , which is only valid at low colloid densities .",
    "the last term within the braces is the second virial coefficient term for the polymer - sphere interaction : within our approximation it is just @xmath9 independent sphere - blob excluded volume interactions , each with an excluded volume @xmath13 . in order to obtain a simple analytic theory we will neglect not only all terms for the sphere - polymer interaction beyond the leading order , second virial coefficient term , but all the terms from sphere - sphere interactions , including the leading order @xmath25 term shown in eq .",
    "( [ flory_mix ] ) .",
    "this latter approximation is quite severe but we do this in the expectation that the sphere - sphere interactions will not be very large when the colloidal spheres and polymer demix and that the sphere - sphere interactions , unlike the blob - blob interactions , are not essential to understanding the basic physics of this demixing .    making these two approximations and defining a reduced density of spheres @xmath26 , eq .",

    "the quantity @xmath31 is the ratio between the excluded volumes of the sphere - blob and blob - blob interactions , @xmath32 .",
    "apart from a somewhat more complex dependence on @xmath17 , eq .  ( [ flory_mix ] ) is of the same form as the free energy of eq .",

    ". the free energy eq .",
    "( [ flory_mix2 ] ) is linear in the density of spheres , @xmath33 .",
    "this makes it easy to analytically transform from fixed @xmath16 and @xmath34 to fixed @xmath16 and @xmath35 , where @xmath35 is the chemical potential of the colloidal spheres .",
    "this transform is useful as then we have a thermodynamic potential , called the semigrand potential , which depends on one density variable , @xmath16 or @xmath17 , and one field variable , @xmath35 .",
    "this is completely analogous to the helmholtz free energy of a single component system in which temperature is important ; that free energy also depends on a density variable ( the number density ) and a field variable ( the temperature ) . as such",
    "once we have the semigrand potential calculating phase equilibria is just as easy as for a single component system .",
    "so , at fixed @xmath17 and @xmath35 the relevant thermodynamic function is the semigrand potential @xmath36 .",
    "in fact it is slightly more convenient to work with the activity of the colloid @xmath37 not the chemical potential .",

    "they studied colloidal particles + saws with @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 . in the simulations the size of colloidal particle not that of the polymer was varied but for the moment we will assume that in each case @xmath82 so that in the simulations the blob - blob and blob - sphere interactions are both in the good solvent scaling regime and our parameter @xmath66 .",
    "this leaves us with the problem of estimating the values of our parameter @xmath9 for the simulated systems . for large polymers we must have that @xmath122 as @xmath9 is extensive in the contour length of the polymer . in order to obtain an estimate for @xmath9 we set the unknown numerical prefactor in this scaling relation to 1 , and @xmath123 , and so obtain @xmath124 , 26 and 46 for the three simulated systems .    for these three systems",
    "we predict critical points at polymer blob volume fractions @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "preliminary simulation results for the critical densities are @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , where @xmath131 $ ] . using the theoretical result @xmath89 in the good solvent regime and converting from @xmath132 to @xmath9 as above we have that @xmath133 .",
    "converting our theoretical predictions to values of the ratio @xmath134 , we have @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the theoretical predictions are about an order of magnitude too small , although the trend with increasing @xmath132 is correct .",
    "part of the discrepancy may come from our crude estimation of the relationship between the size of the polymer , @xmath132 , and the number of blobs , @xmath9 , but it seems very likely that the theory is also underpredicting the density of polymer when it demixes from the spheres .",
    "preliminary results for the volume fraction of spheres at the critical demixing point , @xmath64 , are around @xmath138-@xmath136 whereas we find @xmath61-@xmath139 for this range of values of @xmath132 .",
    "again the theory overestimates the extent of the immiscibility .",
    "it should be noted that , in simulation , for the largest value of @xmath132 , the colloidal spheres have a diameter only about ten times that of the monomer .",
    "if the blobs are too small to be in the good solvent regime , the requirement @xmath140 will be violated , and our parameter @xmath31 will be @xmath141 . then the weaker blob - blob interactions in simulation will increase the polymer density at demixing with respect to that given by the theoretical prediction for the good - solvent scaling regime .",
    "the simple theory derived here is clearly not quantitative but this is perhaps no surprise , it is really only capable of giving rough estimates and the qualitative nature of trends .",
    "the precise nature of the trends for @xmath142 will be those for a long polymer in a poor solvent ; see the simulation results of refs .",
    "mixtures of hard spheres and larger , flexible polymers which do not absorb onto the surface of the spheres exhibit extensive immiscibility .",
    "the cross excluded volume interactions in these mixtures , i.e. , the excluded volume interaction between the sphere and the polymer , are large .",
    "so , the spheres and polymers ` get in each others way ' so reducing each others entropy and driving them apart into separate phases @xcite .",
    "the tendency to demix increases as the polymers become larger and larger , because the excluded volume interactions scale linearly with the length of the polymer while the translational entropy gained by mixing solutions of spheres and polymers does not vary with polymer length . here",
    "we derived a simple analytic theory for these mixtures and found that when the excluded volume interactions were so strong that even blobs of size equal to that of the spheres were swollen , a mixture of polymer and much smaller spheres behaves much as a polymer in a poor solvent does .",
    "by contrast , as we showed in earlier work , a mixture of spheres and ideal polymers behaves rather differently .",
    "there the effective third virial coefficient of the polymer is very small , which pushes up the polymer density at the critical point for demixing .",
    "our results are of relevance to mixtures of globular proteins and polymers , as in these mixtures it is easily possible to have polymers large than the protein .",
    "however , our assumption of a purely repulsive interaction between the polymer and the spheres is rather unrealistic for proteins which have rather complex surfaces .",
    "some part of this complex surface may well attract the monomers .",
    "a clean comparison with experiment could be done with experiments on either small synthetic colloidal particles or nanoparticles .",
    "another possibility is to instead of making the colloidal particles smaller , make the polymer bigger by employing dna @xcite .",
    "there however , the colloidal particles would have to be reasonably large as the effective monomer length of dna is about @xmath143 nm and our theory assumes that @xmath144 . an objective for future work could be to relax this restriction to account more accurately for mixtures of spheres with semiflexible polymers such as dna .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank p. bolhuis , a. louis and e. j. meijer for inspiring conversations , and for sending me results of their computer simulations , and a. hanke for providing me with his calculated value for @xmath13 .",
    "i would also like to thank d. frenkel , also for inspiring conversations , and for the invitation to visit amolf , where this work was started ,",
    "here we explore how the critical density varies with the size of the third virial coefficient .",
    "consider the simplest possible virial expansion that has a critical point , an expansion truncated after the third virial coefficient .",
    "for the chemical potential @xmath45 as a function of density @xmath145 this is @xmath146 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the second and third virial coefficients , respectively . assuming that @xmath72 is fixed and that @xmath71 varies linearly with some temperature - like variable @xmath147 , we have @xmath148 , and @xmath149 the critical point occurs when the first and second derivatives of the chemical potential are zero , giving two equations for the critical value of @xmath147 , @xmath150 , and the critical density @xmath151 @xmath152",
    "the second equation gives the density at the critical point straightaway , @xmath153 : the critical density does not depend on the value of the second virial coefficient but on that of the third virial coefficient . for our mixtures of ideal polymers and spheres ,",
    "as the polymers are ideal their blobs do not repel each other , they only interact with each other via the spheres .",
    "thus the third virial coefficient of the polymer blobs ( at constant sphere chemical potential ) is very small and the density at the critical point of demixing correspondingly high .",
    "note that our semigrand potential is a function of the density of polymer and the chemical potential of spheres , whereas the semigrand potential of mixtures of spheres with small polymer molecules of ref .",
    "@xcite and the body of work which has followed this reference , is a function of the chemical potential of the polymer and the density of spheres . in principle of course",
    "it is possible to develop exact theories for both semigrand potentials .",
    "however , in practice the component whose density is specified is the one whose interactions can not be neglected . when the spheres are larger than the polymer molecules , the sphere - sphere interactions are important as demixing tends to occur at high sphere volume fractions . when the polymer molecules are larger the blob - blob interactions are important as we show in section [ secsq ] .",
    "hanke _ et al . _",
    "@xcite calculate a function which they call @xmath154 ( it is plotted in their fig .  4 ) .",
    "they obtain @xmath155 for spheres and saws with @xmath94 .",
    "the second virial coefficient , here called @xmath13 , is related to @xmath154 by @xmath156 . using this expression",
    "we obtain the value quoted in the main text for @xmath13 in the scaling limit of strong excluded volume interactions ."
