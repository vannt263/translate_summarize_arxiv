    "at the lhc , the single top associated production , @xmath11 , offers a unique possibility of the direct measurement of the entry @xmath12 of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark - mixing matrix ( ckm ) , allowing nontrivial tests of the properties of this matrix in the standard model ( sm)@xcite . by this channel",
    "we can also study the @xmath13 vertex , and test precisely the v - a structure of the charged current weak interaction of the top quark by looking at the polarization of this quark@xcite .",
    "furthermore , such a production channel could be interesting in hunting for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the new physics may manifest itself via either loop effects , or inducing non - sm weak interactions to introduce new single top production channels@xcite .",
    "the produced top quark of the @xmath14 process subsequently decays mainly into a @xmath0 boson and a bottom quark , therefore , the observed final states of the single top - quark production in association with a @xmath0 boson are mostly @xmath15 where the two @xmath0 bosons can be reconstructed from their leptonic decay products .",
    "the similar analysis also applies for the @xmath16 process .    besides",
    ", the higgs boson can be produced in association with a high @xmath17 jet .",
    "if the sm higgs boson is in the intermediate mass range , the @xmath18+jet @xmath19+jet process is expected to be a discovery channel for the higgs boson , particularly if the higgs - boson mass is very close to the threshold for the @xmath0-pair production .",
    "b. mellado , _ et al .",
    ", _ conclude in their paper@xcite that the higgs signal significance can be improved by considering also the final states which consist of the leptonic decays of the w pair , and at least one additional jet .",
    "they suggest that the higgs boson associated with only a single jet at large rapidity is requested as a signal .",
    "they find that the backgrounds can be reduced substantially and the sensitivity of experiments can be enhanced in the search for the higgs boson via the @xmath20 production channel .",
    "the qcd next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the process @xmath21 were studied in refs.@xcite . in these papers",
    "the initial quark @xmath22 was assumed , and the subprocesses with @xmath23 in final states are excluded for the reason that such processes can be excluded by anti-@xmath24 tagging or should be seen as continuations of @xmath25 or @xmath26 production .",

    "we use the five - flavor scheme ( 5fs ) in the leading - order ( lo ) and qcd nlo calculations .",
    "the difference between adopting the five - flavor scheme and four - flavor scheme is the ordering of the perturbative series for the production cross section . in the four - flavor scheme",
    "the perturbative series is ordered strictly by powers of the strong coupling @xmath32 , while in the 5fs the introduction of the b quark parton distribution function ( pdf ) allows to resum terms of the form @xmath33 at all orders in @xmath32 .",

    "therefore , the production rates for both the @xmath36 and the @xmath37 productions at the lhc are identical . in the following sections we present only the analytical calculations of the related partonic process @xmath34 and the parent process @xmath38 unless otherwise indicated .",

    "that means the second @xmath65 jet is undetectable or there is no second separable jet being observed for the @xmath239 production events .",
    "the cross sections for the @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 processes combined with the corresponding additional contributions of the pdfs and the ffs shown in eqs.([additional ct])and ( [ ffseq ] ) , are free of the quasicollinear mass singularity induced by the @xmath243 term .",
    "part of these contributions are regarded as the qcd nlo corrections to the @xmath27 process in the qcd nlo contribution collection scheme - ii , where the two @xmath8 protojets are merged as one jet . in table",
    "[ tab2 ] , we present the numerical results of the integrated cross sections for the @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 processes over three different regions of final state phase space with @xmath247 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 , respectively .      in fig.[fig3 ] we present the integrated lo and the qcd nlo corrected cross sections for the @xmath27 processes at the lhc , as the functions of the renormalization / factorization scale .",
    "the full curve is for the lo cross section .",
    "the dashed and dotted curves are for the qcd nlo corrected cross sections by taking the qcd nlo contribution collection scheme - i , and adopting the inclusive and exclusive two - jet event selection schemes , separately .",
    "the dash - dot - dotted and dash - dotted curves are for the results by taking the qcd nlo contribution collection scheme - ii , and adopting the inclusive and exclusive two - jet event selection schemes , respectively .",
    "we can see from fig.[fig3 ] that the curve for the lo cross section is relatively smooth , while the qcd nlo corrections in the qcd nlo contribution collection scheme - i make the uncertainty on @xmath248 rather large .",
    "the qcd nlo corrections in the qcd nlo contribution collection scheme - i by using the inclusive ( `` exclusive '' ) two - jet event selection scheme change the lo cross section by a factor of between @xmath249 ( @xmath250 ) and @xmath251 ( @xmath252 ) when @xmath248 varies from @xmath253 to @xmath254 .",
    "in other words , the scale uncertainties of the qcd nlo corrected cross sections in the qcd nlo contribution collection scheme - i are even worse than that of the lo cross section .",
    "this enhancement of the uncertainty of the qcd",
    "nlo theoretical predictions is partially due to using the 5fs in calculations , and in this scheme the perturbative series is not ordered strictly by powers of the @xmath32 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows also that the qcd nlo corrections in the qcd nlo contribution collection scheme - ii by adopting the inclusive ( `` exclusive '' ) two - jet event selection scheme increase the lo cross section by a factor varying from @xmath255 ( @xmath256 ) to @xmath257 ( @xmath258 ) in the plotted range of @xmath248 .",
    "that shows the qcd corrections in the qcd nlo contribution collection scheme - ii violate the convergence of the perturbative series in some ranges of @xmath248 , particularly the range of @xmath259 .",
    "but we find that the total cross section for the @xmath233 production up to the qcd nlo in the qcd nlo contribution collection scheme - ii demonstrates a weaker scale uncertainty compared with the lo one . that means the energy scale uncertainty of the lo cross section",
    "can be improved by taking the qcd nlo contribution collection scheme - ii and adopting either the inclusive or the exclusive two - jet event selection schemes .",
    "it just reflects that a stable prediction of the integrated cross section for the @xmath27 process requires not only a veto on a second isolated hard jet , but also the inclusion of the qcd nlo corrections contributed by the @xmath10 production events with the two final @xmath8 quarks being merged as one jet . in the further numerical calculations , we take @xmath260 in default of other statements .",

    "as indicated in the introduction , the @xmath233 production may serve as one of the important backgrounds of higgs - boson production associated with a @xmath8 jet , if the higgs - boson mass is larger than @xmath262 . in this subsection",
    "we study the behavior of the qcd nlo corrected cross section for the @xmath38 process as a function of the higgs mass . according to the recent fermilab report@xcite",
    ", the sm higgs - boson mass has been narrowed down to @xmath263 and @xmath264 . in our numerical calculations",
    "we choose higgs mass values and their corresponding widths being @xmath265 , @xmath266 and @xmath267 separately , as provided in sec.[parameters ] . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we present the numerical results of the lo and qcd nlo corrected cross sections , and the corresponding k factors by taking the qcd nlo contribution collection scheme - i with the higgs - boson mass being @xmath268 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 , respectively .",
    "the notations of ( inc . ) and ( exc . ) refer to the results by adopting the inclusive and exclusive two - jet event selection schemes , separately . from this table",
    "we find that the lo and qcd nlo corrected cross sections with both the two two - jet event selection schemes are insensitive to the higgs - boson mass when @xmath269 varies from @xmath268 to @xmath220 .",
    "that is because the contributions of the feynman diagrams , which correspond to the @xmath270 production with @xmath271 subsequently decaying into @xmath0 pair , are very small .",

    "in this paper we calculate the full qcd nlo corrections to the @xmath0-pair production in association with a massive ( anti)bottom jet in the sm at the lhc , which is an important background of the single top production and can be used to search for new physics beyond the sm by using the five - flavor scheme .",
    "the dependence of the integrated cross sections on the factorization / renormalization scale and the higgs mass is studied .",

    "our numerical results show that by taking the qcd nlo contribution collection scheme - i and adopting the inclusive ( exclusive ) two - jet event selection scheme , the k factor of the total cross section for the @xmath27 process at the lhc can reach @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) with @xmath260 .",
    "we find that the lo integrated and differential cross sections are modified by the qcd nlo radiative corrections obviously , and the qcd nlo corrections to the @xmath233 production process with the qcd nlo contribution collection scheme - i can not reduce the scale uncertainty of the lo cross section for the @xmath27 process at the lhc by adopting either the inclusive or exclusive two - jet event selection schemes .",
