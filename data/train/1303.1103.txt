    "veritas is an array of four 12-meter imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes based near tucson , arizona .",
    "this instrument is sensitive to very - high - energy ( vhe ) gamma - ray photons of energy greater than 100 gev and has a 3.5 degree field of view .",
    "each telescope has 350 mirrors which reflect light onto a pixelated camera comprised of 499 photomultiplier tubes .",
    "the instrument has been operating in full array mode since 2007 , and has so far detected 23 vhe blazars , having discovered vhe emission from 10 of them .",
    "see @xcite for further details regarding the operation of veritas .",
    "detection of vhe emitting blazars is made difficult by the pair production between vhe photons and lower energy extragalactic background light ( ebl ) photons @xcite .",
    "the ebl represents the entirety of starlight that has been emitted and reprocessed by dust throughout the history of the universe .",
    "this interaction reduces the observed flux from extragalactic objects in a distant dependent manner , making the detection of higher redshift sources a challenge .",
    "measurements of the ebl offer integrated constraints on all of the processes that contribute , e.g. structure formation and galactic evolution @xcite",
    ". however , due to bright foregrounds in our solar system and galaxy , direct measurements of the ebl are difficult .",
    "moreover , a direct measurement would only reflect the current integrated state , which leaves the challenging task of unraveling the time history of the ebl .",
    "this challenge can be overcome when vhe gamma rays are used to probe the ebl through gamma - ray absorption .",
    "the absorption process deforms the intrinsic vhe gamma - ray spectra emitted by extragalactic objects such as blazars .",
    "this deformation can be used to estimate the spectral properties of the ebl out to the redshift of the source @xcite .",
    "the flat - spectrum - radio - quasar ( fsrq ) 4c + 55.17 has been a steady , bright _ fermi _ lat source , as illustrated by the high energy gamma - ray light curve spanning four years ( figure 1 ) as well as by the various _ fermi _ lat catalog values reported in table i. data from the first eleven months of operation yielded acceptable fits to a power law , with a relatively bright 1 - 100 gev integral flux and a hard index of @xmath2 .",
    "as additional statistics were collected , a log parabola was seen to provide an improved fit to the data .",
    "additionally , this target continues to show a lack of gamma - ray flux variability , unlike other _",
    "lat detected fsrqs .",
    "the steady , bright high - energy gamma - ray flux and hard index made this fsrq a prime candidate for vhe emission .",
    "the relatively regular detections of associated photons with energy above 50 gev ( table ii ) supports the vhe candidacy and the target was added to the veritas observing plan in the spring of 2010 .",
    "the log - parabolic fit can be extrapolated into the vhe band to estimate expected flux values above 100 gev , according to different ebl models as done in figure 2 for the log - parabolic fit found using the first four years of _ fermi _ lat data .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "veritas observed the fsrq 4c+55.17 for 45 hours of livetime between may 2010 and march 2012 at an average zenith angle of 27 degrees , with observations optimized for a low energy threshold of 150 gev .",
    "these observations result in no vhe gamma - ray signal ( 0.0@xmath3 ) .",
    "a 95% confidence upper limit is derived using the rolke method @xcite for an assumed spectral photon index .",
    "although the veritas limit is dependent on the assumed index of five , the limit changes by less than 10% if derived for an index of @xmath4=5@xmath50.5 .",
    "we show the vhe flux from 4c+55.17 to be less than 2.3@xmath6 ergs @xmath7 s@xmath8 at the decorrelation energy of 200 gev during the veritas exposures , which is consistent with the _ fermi _ lat extrapolations with no additional intrinsic turnover above 1 gev . such intrinsic turnover might expected from gamma - ray absorption by the fsrq broad line region , as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it can be seen in figure 2 that the veritas exposure is not yet deep enough to significantly constrain the vhe spectrum of the fsrq .",
    "this research was supported in part by nasa grant nnx10ap71 g from the fermi guest investigator program .",
    "the veritas collaboration is supported by grants from the us department of energy office of science , the us national science foundation , and the smithsonian institution , by nserc in canada , by science foundation ireland , and by stfc in the uk .",
    "we acknowledge the excellent work of the technical support staff at the flwo and at the collaborating institutions for the construction and operation of the instrument .",
    "the fermi collaboration acknowledges generous support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported the development and the operation and scientific data analysis .",
