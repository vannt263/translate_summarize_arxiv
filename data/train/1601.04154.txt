    "there is much ongoing interest in the precision determination of the nucleon s polarizabilities ; see  @xcite for a recent review . the electric polarizability @xmath0 and magnetic polarizability @xmath1 tell us how the nucleon responds to an external electromagnetic field , with current pdg values @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath3 for the proton  @xcite .",
    "the polarizabilities are proportional to the volume and their smallness indicates that the proton is a rigid object due to the strong binding of its constituents . whereas @xmath5 is constrained by a sum rule , the small value for @xmath1 is commonly believed to be due to a cancellation between the nucleon ` quark core ' and the interaction with its pion cloud .    the polarizabilities are encoded in the nucleon compton scattering ( cs ) amplitude @xmath6 which has many applications also beyond polarizabilities . the integrated cs amplitude is relevant for two - photon corrections to nucleon form factors  @xcite and perhaps also for the proton radius puzzle  @xcite . so far , our knowledge of the cs amplitude is restricted to a few kinematic limits including the ( generalized ) polarizabilities in real and virtual cs  @xcite , the nucleon structure functions in the forward limit , and deeply virtual cs ( dvcs ) from where generalized parton distributions are extracted  @xcite . in addition , the crossed process @xmath7 will be measured by panda .",
    "while lattice calculations for polarizabilities are underway ( see  @xcite for references ) , the main theoretical tools to address cs are ` hadronic ' descriptions such as chiral perturbation theory , which provides a systematic expansion of the cs amplitude at low energies  @xcite , and dispersion relations with a direct link to experimental data  @xcite . on the other hand , handbag dominance in dvcs",
    "is well established and a key ingredient to factorization theorems .",
    "is it then possible to connect these two facets by a common , underlying approach at the level of quarks and gluons that reproduces all established features , from hadronic poles to the handbag picture ? in the following",
    "we will briefly outline such an approach and present first calculated results for the proton polarizabilities @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "our tool of choice is the covariant three - body faddeev approach established in  @xcite .",
    "its basic equations are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : faddeev ] .",
    "the faddeev equation determines the nucleon mass and bound - state amplitude ( its ` wave function ' ) by summing up all possible two- and three - body interactions between dressed quarks .",
    "the electromagnetic current matrix element couples the photon to all microscopic ingredients and thereby satisfies electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "r0.35        to solve the faddeev equation one needs to specify its input .",
    "three - body interactions have been neglected so far , and most studies have employed a rainbow - ladder truncation where the two - body kernel is given by a dressed gluon exchange .",
    "the dressed quark propagator is solved from its dyson - schwinger equation and the resulting quark mass function becomes momentum - dependent ; it describes the transition from the input current - quark mass at large momenta to a nonperturbative , dressed ` constituent quark ' mass of a few hundred mev in the infrared . in general",
    ", any truncation must preserve chiral symmetry to ensure a massless pion in the chiral limit via the analogous bethe - salpeter equation ; see e.g.  @xcite for recent advances in this area .",
    "whereas the applicability of rainbow - ladder in the light - meson sector is mainly limited to pseudoscalar and vector mesons , baryons fare much better : the approach reproduces the octet and decuplet ground state masses within @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : masses ] shows results for the @xmath9meson , nucleon and @xmath10 masses as functions of @xmath11 ( which is also calculated ) compared to lattice data and experiment .",
    "the only input is the quark - gluon interaction for the two - body kernel whose model dependence is given by the bands .",
    "in particular , once the model scale is set to reproduce the pion decay constant , there are no further parameters or approximations and all subsequent results are predictions .    apart from mass spectra , a range of form factors have been calculated as well within this setup . among them",
    "are nucleon , @xmath10 and hyperon electromagnetic form factors , the @xmath12 transition , and nucleon axial form factors  @xcite .",
    "all these cases exhibit good overall agreement with experimental data ( where available ) and also lattice results at larger pion masses , with discrepancies at low @xmath13 where pion - cloud effects become important . while the three - body faddeev approach does not depend on explicit diquark degrees of freedom",
    ", it is conceptually close to the quark - diquark framework which typically yields similar results and thereby establishes the presence of strong diquark correlations inside baryons  @xcite .",
    "an advantage is that the approach is not limited to two- and three - body systems : using the very same building blocks , it has been recently also applied to tetraquarks and the muon g-2 problem  @xcite .",
    "given the body of results so far it is desirable to go a step further and ask : what can we learn about compton scattering from such a microscopic perspective ?",
    "the nucleon cs amplitude depends on three independent momenta ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phasespace ] ) : the average nucleon momentum @xmath14 , the average photon momentum @xmath15 , and the momentum transfer @xmath16 .",
    "the process is described by four lorentz - invariant kinematic variables which we define as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the kinematic phase space in the variables @xmath19 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasespace ] . the spacelike region that is integrated over in nucleon - lepton scattering forms the interior of a cone around the @xmath20 axis .",
    "its apex is where the static polarizabilities are defined , with momentum - dependent extensions to real cs ( @xmath21 ) , the doubly - virtual forward limit ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , and virtual cs ( @xmath24 ) including the generalized polarizabilities at @xmath25 .      at the hadronic level",
    "the cs amplitude is given by the sum of born terms , which are determined by the nucleon form factors , and a one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) structure part that carries the dynamics and encodes the polarizabilities , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cs - decomposition ] .",
    "the latter contains @xmath26channel nucleon resonances beyond the nucleon born terms ( including the @xmath10 , roper , etc . ) , @xmath27channel meson exchanges ( pion , scalar , axialvector , @xmath28 ) , and pion loops , with well - established low - energy expansions in chiral effective field theory .",
    "this is usually viewed as the ` correct ' description at low energies , whereas the handbag picture is interpreted as the ` correct ' one at large photon virtualities . hence again",
    "the question : is there a common underlying description at the quark level that is valid in _ all _ kinematic regions and encompasses both approaches ?    in analogy to the form factor diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : faddeev ] one can derive a closed expression for the cs  amplitude at the quark level  @xcite . the topologies that survive in a rainbow - ladder truncation ( apart from permutations and symmetrizations ) are collected in the second row of fig .  [ fig : cs - decomposition ] . ambiguities stemming from intermediate offshell hadrons never arise here because hadronic degrees of freedom do not appear explicitly . instead , the diagrams reproduce the onshell hadron pole contributions :    * diagram ( a ) depends on the three - quark scattering matrix which contains all possible baryon poles , so it reproduces the nucleon born terms as well as all @xmath26channel resonances .",
    "+ * diagram ( b ) contains the quark two - photon ( quark compton ) vertex , which has an analogous decomposition into quark born terms and a 1pi part .",
    "the born terms provide the handbag contributions .",
    "the 1pi part features a quark - antiquark scattering matrix that contains all possible @xmath27channel meson poles and thereby reproduces the meson exchanges in the first row .    neither the handbag nor the cats - ears contributions from diagram ( c ) have a direct analogue in the hadronic expansion where they are rather absorbed into counterterms .",
    "vice versa , the diagrams in the bottom do not contain the microscopic representation of pion loops because those only enter beyond rainbow - ladder . in any case",
    ", the sum of all graphs in the box satisfies electromagnetic gauge invariance so that the resulting cs amplitude is purely transverse ; it is @xmath26channel crossing symmetric ; it reproduces all known hadronic poles ; and it contains the handbag contributions which are perturbatively ( and presumably also nonperturbatively ) important .",
    "is it feasible to calculate all these microscopic diagrams in analogy to what has been achieved for form factors ?",
    "the main obstacle is diagram ( a ) : while there has been progress in the calculation of three- and four - point functions  @xcite , the treatment of six - point functions is so far beyond reach .",
    "we therefore approximate this graph by summing up the leading hadronic diagrams in the form of nucleon resonances . neglecting also diagram ( c ) ,",
    "we calculate graph ( b ) in rainbow - ladder but without further approximations : the quark propagator is obtained from its dyson - schwinger equation , the nucleon amplitude from the covariant faddeev equation , and the quark compton vertex including all ( 128 ) tensor structures from its inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equation  @xcite .",
    "channel nucleon resonances , @xmath27channel meson exchanges and pion loops .",
    "the second row shows the microscopic decomposition ( in rainbow - ladder ) featuring faddeev amplitudes , quark propagators , quark - photon and quark compton vertices , and the three - quark scattering matrix  @xcite.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]      the problem with this strategy is that only the sum of diagrams ( a - c ) is gauge invariant but not the individual graphs alone .",
    "since transversality is connected with analyticity , a simple transverse projection does not suffice because an approximation that breaks electromagnetic gauge invariance can induce kinematic singularities that render its results meaningless .",
    "the problem can be illustrated with a textbook example , namely the photon vacuum polarization whose general form is @xmath29 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 are functions of @xmath13 and must be analytic at @xmath32 ; poles would correspond to intermediate massless particles but since the vacuum polarization is 1pi intermediate propagators are excluded by definition .",
    "gauge invariance entails transversality , @xmath33 , which fixes @xmath34 .",
    "the vacuum polarization can then be written as the sum of a transverse part and a ` gauge part ' ( which is _ not _ longitudinal ) : @xmath35 the transverse dressing function @xmath36 is free of kinematic singularities and zeros .",
    "the gauge part @xmath37 is the tensor that we eliminated in the first place , so @xmath38 must vanish due to gauge invariance .",
    "this is what happens in dimensional regularization , whereas a cutoff breaks gauge invariance and induces a quadratic divergence ( only ) in the gauge part .",
    "if we did not know about the decomposition   and performed a transverse projection , @xmath36 would pick up a @xmath39 pole from the gauge part which invalidates the extraction of @xmath40 .",
    "the transverse / gauge separation is also convenient if gauge invariance is broken by more than a cutoff , for instance by an incomplete calculation : ultimately the sum of all gauge parts must vanish , but the partial result for @xmath36 is still free of kinematic problems and  ideally  not strongly affected by gauge artifacts .",
    "this simple example also provides the template for the cs amplitude , where a complete decomposition into transverse and gauge parts free of kinematic singularities and zeros is necessary as well : @xmath41 \\,u(p_i)\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath42 defined in eq .  .",
    "we employ the transverse tensor basis of refs .",
    "@xcite but insert factors of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath18 where necessary , so that all compton form factors ( cffs ) @xmath45 are dimensionless and invariant under photon crossing and charge conjugation .",
    "the gauge part must be zero and vanish if all diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs - decomposition ] are included .",
    "however , even if one breaks gauge invariance by retaining only a subset of diagrams , the transverse cffs still yield a well - defined prediction .",
    "this can be understood already at the hadronic level .",
    "the definition of polarizabilities entails that both the born and 1pi parts must be individually gauge invariant , so the expansion   must hold for both contributions alone .",
    "the born terms are specified by the nucleon s electromagnetic current , but since the intermediate nucleon is offshell the half - offshell nucleon - photon vertex can have more tensor structures .",
    "it is well known that only an onshell dirac current with @xmath13-dependent pauli and dirac form factors ensures gauge invariance of the born term .",
    "the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasespace ] shows the leading cffs for this case after removing the common nucleon pole factor .",
    "note that all cffs are well - behaved and approach constant values for @xmath46 .",
    "as required , the gauge part is exactly zero .",
    "the implementation of offshell form factors destroys this property : the gauge part then no longer vanishes but within a reasonable range of model parametrizations the transverse cffs remain almost unchanged .",
    "another remarkable feature is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasespace ] : the bands contain the _ full _ kinematic dependence on all four variables @xmath20 , @xmath47 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 inside the cone , but effectively they only depend on @xmath20 .",
    "the residues of the nucleon born terms therefore scale with @xmath20 , which reflects the symmetric makeup of the phase space .",
    "the hadronic poles form planes in the phase space that will generally counteract this symmetry property : the nucleon born poles appear at @xmath48 ; the nucleon resonance poles form vertical planes at fixed @xmath49 , where the value of @xmath44 depends on the width of the resonance ; and @xmath27channel meson poles appear at fixed @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 .        the nucleon polarizabilities @xmath0 and @xmath1 are related to the cffs @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the limit where all kinematic variables are zero : @xmath55 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarizabilities ] we show preliminary results from the quark - level calculation extracted from the basis in eq .",
    "[ cs - basis ] .",
    "so far they are only ballpark estimates : the quark compton vertex that enters in the calculation depends on 6 lorentz invariants and 128 tensor structures and its transverse / gauge separation is extremely sensitive to the numerics .",
    "we extracted the momentum dependence of @xmath5 from @xmath53 only whereas the standard definition  @xcite contains admixtures from higher cffs at @xmath56 , but for those our results are still too noisy .    the hatched bands in fig .  [",
    "fig : polarizabilities ] are the outcome of diagram ( b ) inside the cone . for the total result we added the @xmath10 resonance , the dominant hadronic contribution to diagram ( a ) , using a parametrization for the experimental @xmath12 form factors .",
    "for comparison we plot the dispersion relation results for the generalized polarizabilities from refs .",
    "the figure makes clear that the sum @xmath5 is dominated by diagram ( b ) and , as it turns out , especially by the handbag contributions .",
    "the magnetic polarizability @xmath1 is dominated by the @xmath10 pole from diagram ( a ) whereas ( b ) contributes little due to cancellations .",
    "the discrepancy at low @xmath20 is presumably due to missing pion loops  @xmath1 is subject to cancellations between the quark core ( which then mainly comes from the @xmath10 pole ) and pion cloud effects .",
    "to summarize , we demonstrated how to extract microscopic information on nucleon polarizabilities from the decomposition in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs - decomposition ] .",
    "it will be further interesting to investigate spin polarizabilities and gather knowledge on the spacelike momentum dependence of the cs amplitude , which will improve our understanding of two - photon corrections to form factors as well as the proton radius puzzle .",
    "finally , the same framework can be adapted to other processes such as pion electroproduction , which has contributed much to our knowledge of nucleon resonances and transition form factors . for their clean extraction",
    "one needs to know the non - resonant ` qcd background ' beyond hadronic exchanges , which is information that a microscopic approach can provide .",
