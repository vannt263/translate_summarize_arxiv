    "the gravitational microlensing optical depth and the event rate toward the galactic bulge ( gb ) are known to be useful observables for the study of the stellar mass function and the structure and kinematics of the galaxy , as these quantities , in addition to the microlensing timescale distribution are related to the masses and velocities of lens objects ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . currently , the microlensing survey groups : moa - ii , ogle - iv , wise @xcite and kmtnet @xcite are detecting a couple of thousand of microlensing events every year toward the gb .",
    "the magnification of a microlensing event is described by the minimum impact parameter ( @xmath17 ) in units of einstein radius @xmath18 , the time of maximum magnification ( @xmath19 ) , the einstein radius crossing time ( or timescale ) ( @xmath20 ) , where @xmath21 is the transverse velocity of the lens relative to the line of sight , @xmath22 is the lens mass , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the distance to the source and the lens , respectively ( @xcite ) .    the microlensing optical depth , @xmath0 is the probability that any given source star is magnified by more than 1.34 ( corresponding to the source being inside the einstein ring disk of the lens ) at any given time .",
    "this is directly related to the mass density of compact objects along the line of sight ( @xcite ) . theoretically , it is simpler than the microlensing event rate , because it does nt depend on the lens mass and lens - source relative velocity distribution .",
    "@xmath0 can be determined observationally from the following expression , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the total number of source stars monitored for microlensing , @xmath27 is the duration of the survey in days , @xmath28 is the einstein radius crossing time for the @xmath29-th event , and @xmath30 is the detection efficiency at that time - scale . because long @xmath31 events give a large contribution to @xmath0 , we present the observed optical depth with a subscript , which indicates the maximum @xmath31 value allowed by each analysis .    the previous galactic bulge microlensing optical depth results have been somewhat controversial ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "the first measurements of the optical depth , @xmath32 by ogle ( @xcite ) and @xmath33 by macho ( @xcite ) , were well above the predictions of @xmath34 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the later studies based on difference image analysis ( dia ) , which is less sensitive to the systematics of blending in crowded fields , also found relatively high values of @xmath36 ( at @xmath37 by macho ( @xcite ) and moa ( @xcite ) .    to explain high optical depths , the presence of a bar oriented along our line of sight to the gb have been suggested ( @xcite ; @xcite;@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "but their predictions range over @xmath38 and had difficulty explaining the observed high optical depths .",
    "@xcite raised the possibility of a systematic bias in the optical depth measurement due to the degeneracy between @xmath31 and @xmath17 in relatively low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) events when the source base - line flux is unknown due to blending ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that optical depth may be estimated without any bias due to blending by using only events with bright source stars , such as red clump giants ( rcg ) , in which the blending might be negligible , rather than using all sources including the faint sources as in previous studies . except for one high value measured by @xcite ,",
    "the other measurements based on events with bright sources resulted in lower optical depths when measured by eros ( @xcite ) , macho ( @xcite ) , and eros @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite realized that lensing of a fainter star that is unresolved from the bright star are common .",
    "but they also noted that this would increase the apparent number of bright star events , while it also make @xmath31 shorter and these two effects would nearly cancel , so that it does not cause large bias in the optical depth . @xcite and",
    "@xcite confirmed this cancelation by image level simulations .",
    "they also measured the bulge optical depth from ogle - ii for rcg sources with high s / n light curves , which allowed them to determine the source brightness and exclude events with faint sources .",
    "thus , they do not rely on the lucky cancelation of the biases .",
    "their result was consistent with the macho and eros values .",
    "these values are consistent with predictions based on the revised cobe bar model by @xcite , which has a mass of @xmath39 and the viewing angle @xmath40 , and the latest cobe elongated bar model by @xcite with @xmath40 .",
    "although the optical depth difference between the rcg sources and the all sources by dia are not very significant due their large errors , the dia optical depth values are systematically larger than the rcg values .",
    "the reason for this is not well understood .",
    "@xcite made optical depth measurements using samples of 83 rcg events and 474 all source events with well measured parameters from the dia analysis of moa - ii data .",
    "this is the largest sample ever used for an optical depth measurement .",
    "their optical depth measurement for all sources was in - between those of previous measurements , i.e. , lower than all source samples and higher than rcg samples and concluded that previous discrepancy between all source sample and rcg sample were just a statistical fluctuation .",
    "@xcite pointed a possible problem on using the same luminosity function in all fields as the one in baade s window for estimating the number of sources at small level .",
    "but they did not consider the completeness of stellar number counts used to normalize that luminosity function .",
    "a systematic bias in the number counts of source stars will affect the measured optical depth .",
    "we investigate this point in this paper .",
    "the event rate per star per year @xmath1 is also affected by the same bias .",
    "this is important for the future space - based microlensing surveys @xcite , like the exoplanet microlensing survey planned for wfirst @xcite or euclid @xcite    in this paper we estimate the completeness of the number count of the source stars and revise the measurement of the microlensing event rate and optical depth toward the gb based on the first two years of the moa - ii survey .",

    "we use the same dataset as @xcite which used the data taken in the 2006 and 2007 seasons by the moa - ii survey , with the 1.8-m moa - ii telescope located at the mt .",
    "john university observatory , new zealand .",
    "the telescope is equipped with the mosaic ccd camera , moa - cam3 @xcite , which has a 2.18 deg@xmath41 field of view ( fov ) with a pixel scale of 0.58 arcsec / pixel .",
    "the median seeing for this dataset was @xmath42 .",
    "the centers of the 22 gb fields of the moa - ii survey are listed in table  [ tbl : fld ] .",
    "the images were taken using the custom moa - red wide - band filter , which is equivalent to the sum of the standard kron / cousins @xmath43 and @xmath44-bands .",
    "the average instrumental magnitudes of the moa reference images were roughly calibrated to the kron / cousins @xmath44-band using ogle - ii photometry map of the galactic bulge @xcite within @xmath450.2 mag .",
    "@xmath46-band images were taken occasionally in order to make instrumental color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) .",
    "the images were reduced with moa s implementation @xcite of the difference image analysis ( dia ) method @xcite . in the dia method , a high - quality , good - seeing reference image is subtracted from each observed image after matching the seeing and photometric scaling .",
    "this method provides precise relative photometry in very crowded stellar fields .",
    "a stellar catalog was constructed from these reference images by applying dophot @xcite , the point spread function ( psf)-fitting routine .    each field",
    "is divided into 80 subfields and each subfield is individually calibrated using the rcg feature in each subfield cmd more precisely . about 12% of the area , in which a clear rcg population could not be identified in the cmd , was excluded from the analysis .",
    "the number of subfields used in the final analysis is 1536 in total and also given in table  [ tbl : fld ] for each field .",
    "the coordinates and other properties of the subfields are listed in table  [ tbl : opt_2d ] .    for the microlensing rate and optical depth estimates ,",
    "we use two subsamples of events and star counts :    \\(1 ) the all - source sample uses stars brighter than @xmath47 mag .",
    "this sample contains 474 events .",
    "@xcite did not require that the events be associated with an apparently resolved reference image star , but did require that the source magnitude is determined from the light curve fit and it is brighter than @xmath48 mag .",
    "analysis of these samples is less affected by blending , in the same way as previous all source dia analyses @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis requires that the number of sources be counted independently from the event selection .",
    "the gb fields are so crowded that virtually all the main sequence stars are not individually resolved . to count the number of stars with @xmath49",
    ", @xcite first estimated the center of rcg @xmath44-band magnitude , @xmath50 , and the number of rcg , @xmath51 , by fitting the magnitude distribution of the reference images in each subfield with equation ( 4 ) of @xcite .",
    "rcg stars are abundant and serve as a good standard candle ( @xcite ) that trace out the density structure of the gb , and hence their numbers should be proportional to the number of all sources .",
    "@xcite then constructed a combined luminosity function ( lf ) by using the star catalogs measured in baade s window using the moa - ii reference image for bright stars , and",
    "_ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) imaging @xcite for faint stars down to @xmath52 mag .",
    "this combined lf is calibrated to the extinction and gb distance , and normalized for each subfield so that its @xmath50 and @xmath51 are same as the values in each subfield . then the number of stars @xmath26 are counted down to @xmath53 mag by integrating this scaled - combined lf as shown in table  [ tbl : fld ] .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is that it assumes that the lf in all fields is the same as that of baade s window @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it was believed that faint sources can be counted without any problem with blending , because @xmath51 is less affected by blending because rcgs are bright .",
    "however , below , we show that @xmath51 does suffer from incompleteness and that this method is not tolerant against this bias for the measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 because the number of events is not affected by this incompleteness .",
    "\\(2 ) the red clump giant ( rcg ) sample selects only events with @xmath54 , as measured from the lightcurve . to estimate the number of sources , stars in the `` extended rcg region ''",
    "are counted in the cmd of the reference images as shown in figure 1 of @xcite with @xmath54 mag and the source colors of @xmath55 mag , where @xmath56 is the @xmath57 color of rcg centroid .",
    "there is no color cut on the event selection , but it is assumed that the blue disk sources in front of the bulge have negligible event rate .",
    "this process is similar to the ogle - ii optical depth analysis @xcite that makes use of the ogle - ii extinction map @xcite , which is based on the rcg position in the cmd .",
    "this contains not only rcgs but also bulge red giants , which is a similar definition to previous works @xcite .",
    "this sample contains 83 events .",
    "contrary to previous rcg analyses @xcite , @xcite did not require the event to be associated with an apparently resolved star .",
    "so this method is closer to the all source sample analysis above than the previous rcg analyses .",
    "thus their moa - ii rcg analysis is less affected by blending , but affected by the same incompleteness bias as the all - source analysis . on the other hand , incompleteness of the source star count",
    "did not affect the previous rcg analyses because the incompleteness in event selection and source count cancel each other out ( see more details in  [ sec : summary ] ) .      the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ; @xcite ) also conducts a microlensing survey toward the galactic bulge with the 1.3 m warsaw telescope at the las campanas observatory in chile .",
    "the median seeing is about 1.3 arcsec . the third phase of ogle , ogle - iii carried out survey observations with a 0.36 deg@xmath41 fov mosaic ccd camera .",
    "most observations are taken in the standard kron - cousin @xmath44-band with occasional observations in the johnson @xmath46-band .",
    "@xcite identified rcgs in the cmds by using ogle - iii photometry maps towards the galactic bulge fields @xcite which cover @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "each of the 2104 ogle - iii subfields ( eight detectors over 263 fields ) used in the work was split into 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 15 , or 21 rectangles depending on the surface density of stars .",
    "the average rectangle size is @xmath60 . in each rectangle",
    ", they estimated the center of the rcg @xmath44-band magnitude , @xmath50 , and the number of rcg , @xmath51 by fitting the luminosity function with equation ( 4 ) of @xcite .",
    "thanks to their better seeing and longer exposure than moa - ii , the completeness of the ogle - iii rcg number count is much higher than that of the moa - ii catalog and likely to be almost complete .",
    "we investigate the completeness of the number count of rcgs in the moa - ii gb fields used in @xcite , @xmath61 , by comparing it to that of ogle - iii @xcite , @xmath62 .",
    "figure [ fig : nrc_nataf_moa ] shows comparison of the number of rcg per subfield ( 98 arcmin@xmath41 ) in moa ( @xmath61 ) at @xmath6 and that in ogle ( @xmath63 ) which are an average over points within 0.085 degrees of the moa subfield center .",
    "one can see that they are consistent at low number density @xmath64 , but as the stellar density increases , @xmath61 becomes systematically lower by up to 30% .",
    "this trend is as expected because the completeness depends on the stellar number density , but the magnitude of the difference is significantly larger than anticipated by previous studies , and this could bias the measured @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig : nrc_b ] shows the counts as a function of galactic latitude @xmath3 .",
    "one can see that they are consistent at higher galactic latitude around @xmath65 , but @xmath61 is systematically fewer than @xmath62 at lower @xmath3 as the number density is higher near the galactic center .",
    "the completeness of rcg counts is expected to depend not only on the number density , but also the rcg magnitude , which depends on the interstellar extinction and the distance to the galactic bar structure .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : frc_color_map ] shows the ratio , @xmath66 i.e. , the completeness if we assume that @xmath62 is complete , as a function of the @xmath44-band rcg magnitude measured by @xcite , @xmath67 and of @xmath63 .",
    "one can see that @xmath2 is basically higher for brighter @xmath67 and smaller @xmath63 as expected , but the trend is somewhat complicated .",
    "the middle and bottom panels of figure [ fig : frc_color_map ] show @xmath2 in ( @xmath3 , @xmath63 ) and ( @xmath3 , @xmath68 ) space , respectively . both @xmath63 and @xmath68 have a clear relation with @xmath3 , which explains the clear trend of @xmath51s with @xmath3 in figure [ fig : nrc_b ] . in the top and middle panels of figure [ fig : frc_color_map ]",
    ", one can see that the @xmath2 are systematically higher at smaller @xmath63 at given @xmath68 and @xmath3 .",
    "some fraction of this trend can be attributed to the bias due to the statistical uncertainty of @xmath63 itself . because @xmath2 is inversely proportional to @xmath63 , @xmath2 correlates with @xmath63 .    in order to correct the number counts for incompleteness",
    ", we fit for relations between @xmath2 as a function of @xmath63 , @xmath68 and @xmath3 , which are shown in figure [ fig : frc_nrc ] , figure [ fig : frc_irc ] and the top - left panel of figure [ fig : frc_b ] , respectively . the scatter in these figures , as well as figure [ fig : nrc_nataf_moa ] , are about 10% . in principle , if both data sets were equally complete , there should be no scatter between the two . the poisson uncertainty on the number of stars that are missed in the moa data is expected to be a few percent .",
    "the variation of incompleteness in different subfields can generate additional scatter .",
    "we also expect that some scatter is caused by the averaging of nataf et al.s subfields in order to match a moa subfield , together with the fact that the sky covered by the averaged nataf et al . subfields is not exactly the same as the sky covered by the moa subfield . here",
    "we perform the linear fits with recursive 3@xmath12 clipping . in all figures",
    ", we can see clear trends .",
    "the standard deviations of the residuals for @xmath63 , @xmath68 and @xmath3 , after ( before ) 3@xmath12 clipping , are 0.10 ( 0.13 ) , 0.11 ( 0.14 ) and 0.10 ( 0.13 ) , respectively .",
    "thus the relation with @xmath63 and @xmath3 are better than that of @xmath68 . as",
    "the aim of the this comparison is to correct the number counts for the completeness , it could bias the result if we use @xmath63 itself to correct for it , as they have their own uncertainty as mentioned above .",
    "thus we decided to use the relation , @xmath69    in figure [ fig : frc_b ] , we also show @xmath2 as a function of @xmath3 with the galactic longitude of @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "one can see that this relation does not depend on the galactic longitude .",
    "so , we apply the relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : frc_b ] ) to all subfields .",
    "if there is a significant systematic trend in @xmath73 , then it could also cause a bias in the number count of sources for the all source sample .",
    "it is possible that the incompleteness of the rcg mentioned above might bias @xmath73 .",
    "we show the differences between @xmath73 and @xmath68 as a function of @xmath3 in figure [ fig : dirc_b ] .",
    "one can see that there is a weak trend , while the amount of the difference due to this slope over the range @xmath74 is comparable to the uncertainty in calibration between ogle and moa magnitudes which is about @xmath450.2 mag .",
    "this difference may also be due to the difference in the filter of moa and ogle but it is not clear at this stage .",
    "the systematic trend in @xmath50 would affect estimates of the event detection efficiency in a complicated way in addition to affecting estimates of the number of sources . to see the magnitude of the bias due to systematics in @xmath50 , we calculated the optical depth by correcting the correlation of @xmath75 .",
    "we found that the difference from the optical depth results without this correction is a few percent or less than 10% at a maximum .",
    "given the concordance of our updated optical depths with other data sets that would not be affected by this bias , we anticipate that the effect of the bias is smaller than our statistical uncertainties .",
    "because the reason for the trend in @xmath50 is not clear and the effect is relatively small compared to the bias due to the incompleteness on the number count , we correct only for the effect of incompleteness on the number count and not for the effect on @xmath50 in the following analysis .",
    "the @xcite analysis is conservative in order to ensure high completeness . to ensure the completeness in the @xmath46-band",
    ", they only consider fields where @xmath76 , which allows a maximum reddening of @xmath77 with the intrinsic rcg color of @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the rcgs are more complete in @xmath44-band , which are used for the number count , because they are 3.3 magnitude brighter than in @xmath46-band at this reddening .",
    "the ogle luminosity function of any field shows that the number counts drop off at @xmath79 mag , meaning completeness likely begins to fall at @xmath80 mag or fainter .",
    "in contrast , the maximum reddening of @xmath77 implies @xmath81 based on the rcgs at 8kpc with the intrinsic @xmath44-band magnitude of @xmath82 and the average total - to - selective extinction ratio of @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "this is substantially brighter than the estimated completeness cutoff . for the rcg number count , @xcite used stars with @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "they included stars without @xmath46-band photometry assuming that they are fainter in @xmath46-band , i.e. , redder than the limit @xmath86 . thus their number count is not affected by the incompleteness in @xmath46-band .    on the other hand , there some reasons for the incompleteness of rcg number count in moa - ii analysis by @xcite .",
    "the major reason is the incompleteness in @xmath46-band catalog compiled using dophot .",
    "the limiting magnitude in @xmath44-band is @xmath87 mag which is still deeper than the @xmath44-band rcg magnitude of @xmath81 with the reddening of @xmath77 given above , which is roughly equivalent to or slightly lower than the maximum reddening in moa - ii fields .",
    "however , @xmath46-band limiting magnitude is about @xmath88 mag , which is comparable to the @xmath46-band rcg magnitude of @xmath89 with @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath90 by using @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "@xcite computed the rcg number count using stars selected with a similar color and magnitude limit as ogle , @xmath91 mag , @xmath84 as shown in their figure 1 .",
    "however , stars without @xmath46-band photometry were not included .",
    "thus the incompleteness in @xmath46-band catalog affects the number count .",
    "we conclude that the rcg number count in moa - ii was not optimized for this purpose .",
    "there are some ways to avoid this problem in future analysis for moa - ii .",
    "for example , ( 1 ) get deeper @xmath46-band images , ( 2 ) include all stars without a @xmath46-band detection following @xcite , ( 3 ) use the ogle number count instead .",
    "here we have re - calculated the microlensing optical depth and event rate by following @xcite , but using the stellar number count corrected for the completeness by eq.([eq : frc_b ] ) .",
    "the optical depth , @xmath0 , can be calculated by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : opt ] ) . the microlensing event rate per star per year , @xmath1 , can be determined observationally from the following expression , @xmath92 here we use the detection efficiency determined by @xcite . in our event rate and optical depth analyses for this 2006 - 2007 data",
    "set , @xmath93 days and the corrected number of source stars is ( 1 ) @xmath94 for the all - source sample and ( 2 ) @xmath95 for the rcg sample .",
    "individual optical depth estimates for all sources in each field are listed in table  [ tbl : fld ] .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : fieldmaps ] shows a smoothed map of optical depth of each subfield in galactic coordinates .",
    "the plotted values from all subfields are listed in table [ tbl : opt_2d ] of the online version , with a sample of this table listed in the printed version of this paper .",
    "the smoothing is done with a gaussian function with @xmath96 , and cut off at a distance of @xmath97 from the center of each subfield .",
    "the error bars for each subfield are estimated with the bootstrap method of @xcite , using the neighboring subfields with the same weighting as in the calculation of the central values .",
    "we also estimated the average optical depth in all fields combined , and found @xmath98 with 474 events for all source sample and @xmath99 with 83 events for rcg sample at @xmath100 .",
    "these are reductions of @xmath101 and @xmath102  percent , respectively , or @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "the effective line of sight was computed by weighting the number of subfields used .",
    "the errors were estimated using the bootstrap monte - carlo method of @xcite .",
    "the optical depth given by equation  ( [ eq : opt ] ) does not follow poisson statistics because each event is summed with an unequal weight of @xmath105 . therefore , we binned the optical depth values of the subfields in order to model the optical depth distribution .",

    "the optical depth clearly increases with decreasing @xmath108 , and a simple exponential fit gives , @xmath109\\times10^{-6 } \\exp[(0.44\\pm 0.07)(3-|b|)]$ ] for the all - source sample as indicated by the black solid line in figure  [ fig : optball ] .",
    "this is a significantly lower and shallower slope than the original result of @xmath110\\times10^{-6 } \\exp[(0.51\\pm 0.07)(3-|b|)]$ ] estimated by @xcite before correcting the completeness of the rcg number count .",
    "the exponential model still represents the data well .",
    "this result is significantly smaller than the measurements by moa - i @xcite and macho @xcite with all - source samples .",
    "contrary to the original measurements , it is very consistent with the rcg measurements by macho @xcite , eros-2 ( @xcite ) and ogle - ii @xcite .",
    "the best linear fit to the ogle - ii rcg measurements is indicated by the red dashed line in figure  [ fig : optball ] as a comparison .",
    "the macho @xcite and eros @xcite analyses identified microlensing events solely by their proximity to apparent rcg stars identified in the reference images , with no attempt to determine if the source is a rcg star or a blended fainter main sequence star .",
    "these blending effects will shrink apparent @xmath31 values for all events , while increasing the number of apparent rcg events . @xcite and @xcite make arguments to suggest that these two effects approximately cancel .    the only previous rcg sample that distinguished rcg source events from events with main sequence sources that happened to be blended with rcg stars was the ogle - ii analysis of @xcite .",
    "i.e. , they are less affected by blending than the above macho and eros rcg analyses .",
    "the one similarity of their rcg analysis with other rcg analyses is that they require that events to be associated with resolved stars .",
    "their ogle - ii value is consistent with macho and eros rcg analyses .",
    "thus it is likely that this cancellation of shrinking @xmath31 and increasing the number of events , works to within the accuracy presented in their analyses , as confirmed by image level simulation by @xcite .",
    "an exponential fit for the optical depth toward rcg sources gives @xmath111\\times10^{-6 } \\exp[(0.40\\pm 0.17)(3-|b|)]$ ] , which is indicated by the red solid line in the figure  [ fig : optball ] .",
    "this is also significantly lower than the original estimate and previous rcg measurements @xcite and some older bulge models @xcite .",
    "however , in this particular analysis , this @xmath0 estimate for the rcg sample is heavily biased by the low detection efficiency for events with @xmath112days , due to the fact that the analysis was originally designed to focus on short time scale events .",
    "although the events with @xmath113days are selected , most of the events with @xmath112days with bright sources could not satisfy the requirement for a long enough constant baseline .",
    "this is because the tails of the events are longer than @xmath31 and they are still significantly above the baseline for bright source events .",
    "this effect is negligible for the all source sample .",
    "thus we can not directly compare this result with other measurements .",
    "the event rate per square degree per year , @xmath114 , for source stars above a magnitude threshold of @xmath47 , which are given in table [ tbl : fld]-[tbl : opt_2d ] for completeness , does not change from @xcite because this quantity is independent of the stellar number count .",
    "thus , we focus on the event rate per star per year , @xmath1 , in the rest of the paper .",
    "we model the event rate , @xmath1 by using the poisson statistics fitting method , first introduced by @xcite .",
    "this method allows us to fit to the raw , subfield data , even though the average number of events per subfield is @xmath115 , thus free from the problem on the binning of the sample and the improper assumption of the gaussian statistics .",
    "the number of expected events in a subfield is given by @xmath116 where @xmath26 is the number of stars in the subfield , and @xmath117 is the detection efficiency averaged over @xmath31 for the subfield at coordinates @xmath118 .",
    "we adopt the average detection efficiency given in tables 2 and 3 of @xcite , for the all - star and rcg samples , respectively , while @xmath26 need to be corrected by eq .",
    "( [ eq : frc_b ] ) .",
    "the probability of the observed number of events , @xmath119 , in the subfield at @xmath118 is @xmath120= \\frac { e^{-n_{\\rm ev , exp}(l , b ) } n_{\\rm ev , exp}(l , b)^{n_{\\rm ev}(l , b)}}{n_{\\rm ev}(l , b ) ! } \\ , \\ ] ] according to poisson statistics .",
    "we can then define the @xmath121 by , @xmath122 .",
    "$ ]    thus the event rate , @xmath1 , is the preferred quantity to compare to galactic models rather than the optical depth .",
    "we show the event rate per star per year @xmath1 and the exponential fits for the all - source and rcg samples as a function of the galactic latitude , @xmath3 , for @xmath6 in figure [ fig : gamma_vs_b ] and in tables  [ tbl : opt_binb_all_lth5 ] and [ tbl : opt_binb_rcg_lth5 ] , respectively .",
    "the event rate has much less scatter than @xmath106 and @xmath1 for both the all - source and rcg samples , and both are well fit by a simple exponential model . note that these fits are done to the subfield data using the poisson statistics method , while the plots show binned quantities for display in figure [ fig : gamma_vs_b ] and in tables  [ tbl : opt_binb_all_lth5 ] and [ tbl : opt_binb_rcg_lth5 ] .",
    "the exponential model for the all - source and rcg samples are quite similar with @xmath123\\times10^{-6 } \\exp[(0.53\\pm 0.05)(3-|b| ) ] \\,{\\rm star}^{-1}{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ ] for the all - source sample and @xmath124\\times10^{-6 } \\exp[(0.58\\pm 0.12)(3-|b| ) ] \\,{\\rm star}^{-1}{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ ] for the rcg sample .",
    "again , due to the @xmath26 correction , these have a smaller and shallower slope than the original values in @xcite .",
    "the rcg event rate is slightly smaller , but consistent with the all - source event rate .",
    "the rcg slope is @xmath125 steeper and the amplitude is is 8% or @xmath126 smaller . as noted earlier , this is because @xmath1 is much less sensitive to the bias due to the small number of long @xmath31 events .",
    "@xcite noted that although there is a possible problem with assuming the luminosity function in all other fields are same as the _ hst _ luminosity function measured in baade s window @xcite , the uncertainty due to the different luminosity function shape would largely cancel out if the same luminosity function is used in the detection efficiency simulations and the source star counts .",
    "the consistency between the all - source and rcg @xmath1 values indicates that the effect due to the variation of the luminosity function shape in each field relative to the _ hst _ luminosity function are negligible .",
    "however , they were not aware that the effect on the normalization of the luminosity function is more significant than its shape .",
    "we show exponential fits as a function of the galactic latitude @xmath3 for @xmath106 and @xmath1 for different bins in galactic longitude , @xmath127 in figures [ fig : tau_vs_b_l ] and [ fig : gamma_vs_b_l ] , respectively .",
    "the black points and curves are for all the events with @xmath128 . in figure",
    "[ fig : gamma_vs_b_l ] , it provides a reasonable fit to all the longitude bins , except the @xmath129 bin , where there is an enhancement to the rate . on the other hand",
    ", there is some scatter in @xmath106 between different bins in figure [ fig : tau_vs_b_l ] .",
    "the @xmath106 bin with @xmath129 at small @xmath108 is smaller than the average , which is different from @xmath1 .",
    "this is because average @xmath31 is smaller at these galactic central regions due to the galactic kinematics as shown in fig . 3 of @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fieldmaps ] shows smoothed maps of @xmath106 and @xmath1 in galactic coordinates .",
    "the plotted values from all subfields are listed in table [ tbl : opt_2d ] .",
    "the smoothing is done with a gaussian function with @xmath96 , and cut off at a distance of @xmath97 from the center of each subfield .",
    "the error bars for each subfield are estimated using a bootstrap method using the neighboring subfields with the same weighting as in the calculation of the central values .",
    "they are similar to the original maps in fig . 3 of @xcite , but decreased by up to @xmath130% depending on @xmath3 .",
    "the highest optical depth is found at @xmath131 and this is due to the excess of long timescale events at this longitude , and could be due to the statistical fluctuations enhanced by large weight for long events .    the event rate per star , @xmath1 has a peak at @xmath132 . because these event rate measurements obey poisson statistics , the statistical uncertainty in @xmath1 is smaller than the uncertainty in @xmath106 .",
    "so , we expect that this @xmath132 enhancement in the microlensing rate is real and that it is related to the structure and kinematics of the bulge .    as a comparison to @xcite ,",
    "we have fit @xmath1 with a 16-parameter model in @xmath127 and @xmath3 .",
    "the 16 parameters consist of a 10-parameter cubic polynomial and the inverse of a 6-parameter quadratic polynomial .",
    "that is @xmath133 the best fit model is shown in figure [ fig : gamma_2d ] and the model parameters are listed in table  [ tbl : param_2d ] . the model has a maximum at @xmath132 that was also evident in figure [ fig : fieldmaps ] .",
    "[ sec : summary ]    we examined the completeness of the stellar number count in the measurement of the microlensing optical depth @xmath0 and event rate per star per year @xmath1 toward the galactic bulge from the first two years of the moa - ii survey @xcite .",
    "we found a significant incompleteness in moa - ii s rcg counts , which is proportional to the galactic @xmath3 .",
    "the completeness rangs from 1 to 0.7 for @xmath5 .",
    "the counts are less complete at lower @xmath108 because of the higher stellar number density and the higher interstellar extinction .",
    "this incompleteness caused the overestimates in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    by correcting this incompleteness , we estimated @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the all source sample of 474 events and a rcg sample of 83 events .",
    "note that our rcg optical depth is known to be biased low , due to the low efficiency for long duration bright events .",
    "thus we focus on @xmath0 with all source sample in the following discussion . due to this correction of the incompleteness",
    ", both @xmath0 and @xmath1 decreased at lower @xmath108 .",
    "this result may have solved the previously noted difference between the optical depths measured with rcg samples @xcite and that with faint source samples from dia @xcite , for which the faint source analyses have shown systematically higher @xmath0 values .",
    "the original measurement of @xmath0 with all source by moa - ii @xcite were in - between of the other previous measurements with all - source and rcg sample and consistent within 1 or 2-@xmath12 level .",
    "thus they concluded that the previously seen difference between the all - source and rcg samples was due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "however , our revised all - source optical depth measurements are consistent with previous measurements for rcg samples and significantly lower than that of the @xcite all - source sample as shown in figure [ fig : optball ] .",
    "we can use the exponential models shown in figure [ fig : optball ] to interpolate our measurement to the center of previous samples . for the macho",

    "@xcite noted a possible problem with assuming that the luminosity function in all fields are same as the _ hst _ luminosity function in baade s window @xcite .",
    "however , the consistency between the all - source and rcg @xmath1 values indicates that the effect due to the variation of the luminosity function shape in each field from the _ hst _ luminosity function are negligible .",
    "however , @xcite were not aware that the completeness of the number counts of rcgs might be problematic , because they were thought to be bright enough to be complete . in their analyses for both all source sample and rcg sample ,",
    "the stellar number count is based on the stellar catalog in the reference images reduced by dophot @xcite algorithm , where the combined ground+hst luminosity function are normalized by the rcg number counts and the events were selected regardless of whether they are associated with resolved stars .",
    "thus , both samples are biased by the same amount .",
    "this incompleteness is mostly because moa - ii data was taken under relatively poor seeing of @xmath177 arcsec even in the reference images .",
    "the measurements by moa - i @xcite and macho @xcite also used a similar method with similar seeing , and are therefore expected to suffer the same problem .",
    "other measurements using rcg samples by ogle - ii @xcite , macho @xcite and eros @xcite used a different method , which selected only the events at the position of the resolved stars in the reference image by dophot or similar algorithm .",

    "our goal is to measure @xmath1 and @xmath0 precisely around the galactic bulge to constrain the barred galactic bulge model .",
    "currently moa - ii and ogle - iv detect about 700 and 2,000 events a year , respectively . in the near future",

    "another goal of this work is to predict the event rate in the inner galactic bulge for the future space microlensing survey of the wide field infrared space telescope ( wfirst ) @xcite and euclid @xcite .",
    "the expected microlensing event rate for the wfirst mission is uncertain because the region with the highest event rate at low galactic latitudes are not well studied due to the high interstellar extinction .",
    "this work provides the best estimate of the event rate in the inner galactic bulge to date . for @xmath178 of the moa - ii survey area",
    "inside @xmath179 and @xmath180 , centered at @xmath181 , we find @xmath182star@xmath8yr@xmath8 for sources with @xmath183 .",
    "this is consistent with the rate model used for the report of the wfirst science definition team ( sdt ) @xcite evaluated at this position , while the previous value was a factor 1.3 larger than this . by extrapolating to the lower latitude fields ,",
    "@xmath184 , where the wfirst will observe , the model with @xmath185 presented in figure  [ fig : gamma_vs_b_l ] predicts @xmath186star@xmath8yr@xmath8 for sources with @xmath183 . which is consistent with the value in the wfirst sdt report .    in this work ,",
    "we have attempted to correct for incompleteness by assuming that another data set is complete , when that data set itself has not been corrected for completeness  @xcite .",
    "while we expect ogle number counts to be more complete than moa s , it was long assumed that completeness would not be an issue for moa .",
    "this is of course not ideal , but was done so for the sake of expediently correcting a significant systematic error .",
    "instead , in future , it would be better for all studies that fit models to number counts of bulge rcg stars to first correct for incompleteness using artificial star tests . without doing",
    "so it is possible that models fit to the magnitude distribution around the red clump might systematically underestimate the number of stars , as well as the location of the clump if the incompleteness varies as a function of magnitude ( which it almost certainly does ) .",
    "failure to do so could impact studies of galactic structure  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , interstellar extinction  @xcite and as we have shown here , microlensing event rates and optical depths .",
