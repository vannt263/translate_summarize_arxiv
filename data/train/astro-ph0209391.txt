    "the draco ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) and ursa minor ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies are the faintest known members of the local group of galaxies and they are among the lowest surface brightness members of the group @xcite .",
    "they appear to be dominated by very old ( age @xmath16 gyr ) and metal deficient ( @xmath6\\sim -2 $ ] ) stellar populations ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , thus they may represent a very early and elementary stage of the evolution of the building blocks that may have had a primary role in the assembly of the milky way galaxy ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , they are reported to have the highest mass to light ( m / l ) ratio of any other known galaxy .",
    "hence their stellar content may just represent the handful of baryons trapped in a system whose true nature is that of a huge dark halo .",
    "all these exceptional properties have made these galaxies a classical case of study .",
    "nevertheless , serious observational problems ( e.g. , the very low surface brightness that requires very wide field photometry to obtain statistically significant samples of members stars ) have hampered our knowledge of these intriguing stellar systems .",
    "draco and umi are twin galaxies under many aspects : they have a similar distance from the center of the galaxy , similar masses and luminosities , similar metal content and are both devoid of gas ( see table  3 for a summary of their physical parameters ) . in this context , a comparative study performed with strictly homogeneous observational material and with the same data reduction / data analysis techniques may reveal interesting features . here",
    "we present the results of a comparative analysis , performed by obtaining well calibrated ( v , i ) photometry of the evolved stars of umi and draco over a field of view @xmath17 arcmin@xmath2 , under strictly homogeneous conditions ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion of the possible problems associated with the comparison of non - homogeneous photometries ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in  2 we describe the observational material , the data reduction process and the photometric calibration ; in  3 we present the color magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) and the results of artificial stars experiments ;  4 is devoted to the estimate of the distance to draco and umi ; in  5 we study the properties of the red giant branch of the two galaxies . in ",
    "6 we compare the structures of dra and umi and we demonstrate that the inner region of umi is significantly structured and that its stars are clustered according to two different characteristic scale - lenghts .",
    " 7 is dedicated to the discussion of our results .",
    "the data were obtained at the 3.52 @xmath18 italian telescope tng ( telescopio nazionale galileo - roque de los muchachos , la palma , canary islands , spain ) , using dolores , a focal reducer imager / spectrograph equipped with a @xmath19 pixels thinned and back - illuminated loral ccd array ( gain@xmath20 , read - out noise @xmath21 adu rms ) .",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath22 arcsec / px , thus the total field of view of the camera is @xmath23 .",
    "the observations were carried out during three nights ( march 19 , 20 and 21 , 2001 ) , under average seeing conditions ( @xmath24 arcsec ) .",
    "the first and third nights of the run were photometric .",
    "the scientific exposures taken during the second night were calibrated indirectly by using the data acquired in the photometric nights .",
    "each galaxy was sampled with a square mosaic of nine partially overlapping fields , covering a total field of fiew of @xmath25 . for each field two",
    "v and two i exposures ( @xmath26 s in each filter for dra , and @xmath27 s for umi ) were secured .",
    "all the raw images were corrected for bias and flat field , and the overscan region was trimmed using standard iraf procedures .",
    "each pair of images , in each band , has been averaged , so that the final analysis was performed on averaged v and i images .",
    "the psf - fitting procedure was performed independently on each v and i average image , using a version of dophot @xcite modified by p. montegriffo at the bologna observatory to read images in double precision format .",
    "the frames were searched for sources adopting a 5-@xmath28 threshold , and the spatial varations of the psf were modeled with a quadratic polynomial .",
    "a final catalogue listing the instrumental v , i magnitudes for all the stars in each field has been obtained by cross - correlating the v and i catalogues . only the sources classified as stars by the code have been retained .",
    "the spurious sources erroneously fitted by dophot ( as cosmic rays , bright background galaxies etc . ) have been removed by hand from the catalogues .",
    "nine different catalogs ( one for each sub - field of the mosaic ) were obtained for each galaxy .",
    "these catalogue were reported to a homogeneous photometric system using the large sets of stars in common among the various fields .",
    "the magnitudes of the stars in common among adjacent fields were averaged .",
    "a homogeneous total catalogue of instrumental magnitudes and positions was finally obtained obtained for each mosaic field .",
    "the absolute calibration has been obtained from several repeated observations of @xcite standard fields , including all the stars listed in the extended catalogue of calibrators provided by @xcite .",
    "the coefficents of atmospheric extintion ( @xmath29 ) were directly obtained by repeated observations of the same standard field at different airmasses .",
    "accurate estimates of the aperture correction were obtained with a large number of bright and isolated stars . the final calibration equations and @xmath29",
    "are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the accuracy of the photometric calibration was checked by comparison with the independent ( v , i ) photometry of the draco dsph ( kindly provided by prof .",
    "p. stetson , private communication ) , and with the v photometry of umi from @xcite .",
    "the results of this test are shown in fig  2 where the difference between our photometry ( subscript _ t.w .",

    "variable stars were counter - identified in the central @xmath38 field , from the study by @xcite . since an explicit classification is not provided by @xcite we marked all the rr lyrae variables with stars , while the only anomalous cepheid identified is plotted as an open circle , as in the previous case .",
    "however , it has to be recalled that , according to @xcite , the large majority of rr lyrae in draco are of type ab ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as already noted by other authors the morphology of the two hbs is very different .",
    "umi has only an handful of hb stars to the red of the instability strip , a significant number of rr lyrae variables of both bailey s types and a well populated blue tail reaching @xmath39 and @xmath40 . on the other hand",

    "we performed the artificial stars experiment to obtain :    1 .   a realistic estimate of the photometric error as a function of magnitude , by comparing the _ a priori _ known input magnitudes with the measured ( output ) magnitudes .",

    "the hb ridge line of umi has been shifted to match the hb of draco , that has been plotted with the same symbols used above .",
    "the fit is made difficult by the different hb morphology , but the solution obtained here with a shift of @xmath54 mag in v and @xmath55 in v - i appears as the best possible match .",

    "@xcite have recently provided a new robust calibration of the zero - point of the relation between the absolute i magnitude of the tip ( @xmath85 ) and the metallicity that is independent of the distance scale based upon classical standard candles ( rr lyrae , cepheids ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mf95 ) . however , it is of great interest for the final scope of the project to check if the distance of these galaxies is consistent with the new trgb distance scale .    to do this check",
    "we adopt the shift derived in  4.1 to move draco at the distance of umi and we try to detect the trgb from the merged sample , having now a number of stars nearly double with respect to each individual case . in the left panel of fig .",

    "the edge - detector sobel filter shows the trgb as the most pronounced peak at i=@xmath86 .",
    "the considered sample has 100 stars in the upper 1-magnitude bin , however , from the cmd of field stars we estimate that @xmath87 % of them are likely foreground sources .",
    "hence the actual number of stars in the uppermost 1-mag bin is in fact @xmath88 . by means of numerical simulations",
    "mf95 showed that a reasonably safe detection of the trgb can be made only if @xmath89 , thus it is likely that our detection overestimates the actual i magnitude of the tip . to quantify this systematic error we repeat the mf95 numerical experiment .",
    "we adopted the ridge line of m  68 as an rgb template and a model rgb - lf of the same form as the one used by mf95 , imposing a cut - off at @xmath90 .",
    "then we randomly generated 100 synthetic rgbs for each of the following cases : @xmath91 , and we detected the tip of each synthetic rgb with the standard technique .",
    "observational errors extracted from a gaussian distribution with @xmath92 similar to those of the observed stars were added to each synthetic star before the trgb detection .",
    "the average @xmath93 of the 100 simulated rgbs and the corresponding standard deviations are plotted as a function of @xmath94 in fig .  10 . the results by mf95 are confirmed : for @xmath95 the estimate from the standard technique is within @xmath96 mag from the _ true _ trgb and the standard deviation is @xmath97 mag .",
    "the efficiency of the method drops suddenly for @xmath98 and the associated uncertainty becomes @xmath99 or larger .",
    "the difference between the true luminosity of the tip and the observed one can be modeled with a first order polinomial as a function of @xmath94 , for @xmath100 :    @xmath101    in the present case , with @xmath102 , @xmath103 , thus our final estimate for the trgb location is @xmath104 , where we have considered also the uncertainties associated with the correction and with the dra - umi shift we have applied to obtain the considered merged sample .",

    "hence we conclude that the distance moduli derived in  4.2 are fully consistent with the trgb distance scale as calibrated by @xcite .",
    "the rgb - bump is an evolutionary feature occurring along the rgb which flags the point where the h - burning shell crosses the chemical discontinuity left by the maximum penetration of the convective envelope .",
    "theoretical models predict that the position of the rgb - bump is mainly driven by metallicity , with a mild dependence on age ( see f99 and references therein ) .    from the observational point of view",

    "a very similar feature has been revealed also in the sextans dsph by @xcite . at present , these are the only two detections of the rgb - bump ever obtained in stellar systems other than globulars .",
    "the change in the slope of the cumulative luminosity function ( lf ) and the excess of star counts in the differential lf of the rgb are the main tools to identify the rgb - bump . in particular @xcite suggest that the change in the slope of the cumulative lf is the safest indicator of the rgb - bump . in fig .   11 the differential and cumulative lfs of the rgb in the region of the bump",

    "this is the first _ single _ rgb - bump ever detected in a galaxy . on the other hand",
    ", there is no sign of this feature in the lf of draco .",
    "we argue that a larger spread of metallity and/or age in the stellar population of draco , with respect to umi , is responsible for the smearing of the rgb - bump feature in this galaxy ( see  5.2 ) .",
    "this suggests that these dsphs - that are quite similar under many aspects ( see * ? ? ?",

    "thus we confirm the presence of an intrinsic metallicity spread @xcite .",
    "the rgb color of old populations is mainly driven by the metal content of the stars . based on this principle ,",

    "this technique is particularly appropriate in the present case since we know that both galaxies are dominated by very old stellar populations @xcite .",
    "however , the actual metallicity spread derived with this technique ( a ) is the convolution of the intrinsic metallicity spread with the color spread due to observational scatter and , ( b ) the impact of this latter factor _ depends on the mean metallicity _ , since the same observational scatter should produce a larger ( apparent ) metallicity spread in the low metallicity regime , where the rgb ridge lines are steeper , with respect to the high - metallicity regime .",

    "the detailed comparison between our photometric estimates and the study of @xcite is discussed in  5.2.1 , below .",
    "our method is insensitive to very metal poor stars ( @xmath6\\le -2.5 $ ] ) , so they are obviously not represented in our metallicity distribution .",
    "however from fig .",
    "12 it may be evinced that the number of possible rgb stars bluer ( i.e. more metal poor ) than the ngc  6341 template ( at @xmath6=-2.24 $ ] ) should be small in both galaxy ( see  5.2.1 for further details ) .    in fig .",
    "14 the mds of umi and of its synthetic ssp are reported in the same way as in fig .  13 .",
    "it can be appreciated that though the photometric scatter is very similar for draco and umi ( see fig .",

    "also in this case the agreement with results of other studies @xcite and with the constraints obtained in  5.1 is quite good .    from the comparison of the mds of the two galaxies",

    "it is important to remark that the comparison of the observed distributions with chemical evolution models would lead to different conclusions depending on the assumed metallicity scale . in particular , by adopting the cg scale , one should conclude that the first stars in draco and umi formed from an ism already relatively enriched and reached a more advanced stage of chemical evolution than suggested by the zw scale .",
    "this kind of uncertainties in the metallicity scales may have other dangerous drawbacks , hampering our interpretation of astrophysical data in several cases ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".      a detailed comparison with the recent results by @xcite may be useful to check the consistency between high - resolution spectroscopic abundances and photometric metallicity estimates .",
    "the stars observed by @xcite are plotted in fig .",
    "12 as large empty symbols .",

    "first of all we note that all the considered stars have @xmath125 , to within the uncertainties .",
    "this is compatible with the hypothesis that they are first ascent rgb stars , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "second , the metallicity rank derived from spectroscopy is correctly reproduced by our photometry : stars with higher spectroscopic metallicity estimates lie on redder rgb loci . finally , the zero - point of the spectroscopic scale is in good agreement ( within the uncertainties ) with that derived from our photometry , if the cg metallicity scale is adopted .",
    "three out of four of the stars in the more metal poor metallicity bin ( circles ) have @xmath126\\le -2.17 \\pm 0.12 $ ] and lie around the ridge line of ngc  6341 ( @xmath6_{cg}=-2.16 \\pm 0.10 $ ] ) .",

    "the only exception is the star # 119 in draco that is slightly redder than the ridge line of ngc  6341 and that , according to @xcite has @xmath6=-2.97 \\pm 0.15 $ ] .",
    "we have no suggestion to reconcile such a large discrepancy between color and spectroscopic metallicity , except for trying to repeat both measures .    if the zw scale is adopted for the templates shown in fig .",
    "12 the consistency in the metal poor zero - point is preserved ( @xmath6_{zw}=-2.24 \\pm 0.20 $ ] for ngc  6341 ) but a serious problem emerges at the metal rich end , where the two stars with @xmath6 = -1.45 $ ] lie to the blue of the @xmath6=-1.65 $ ] template and the @xmath6=-1.4 $ ] template ( ngc  288 ) is more than 0.1 mag redder than these stars . the problem with star # 119 is not mitigated by the assumption of the zw metallicity scale .",
    "thus it appear that the adoption of the gc metallicity scale provide a much higher degree of consistensy between spectroscopic and photometric metallicity estimates , at least in the present case .",
    "the above comparison may suggest that the metallicities by @xcite are consistent with the cg scale which is also based on high - resolution measures .",
    "finally , another possible source of uncertainty in the photometric metallicity estimates is the small difference in the average abundance of @xmath127-elements between dra and umi and the template clusters ( see * ? ? ? * and discussion therein ) .",

    "the opposite effect is found in draco ( lower panel ) : the bhb fraction drops by a factor 2 in the inner 4 arcmin , i.e. the classical gradient described above , with more metal rich and/or younger stars clustered in the central region .",
    "the significance of the result is just marginal ( @xmath130 ) , thus not in disagreement with the null detection reported by @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of our well defined cmds to select likely members of umi and draco with which reliable density contour maps can be obtained .",
    "the upper panels of fig .",
    "16 show the adopted selections , while in the lower panels of the same figure the isodensity contour maps of the selected members of umi and draco are shown .",
    "our maps cover the inner regions of the galaxies , within 1 - 2 core radii ( @xmath131 ) , and are obtained by computing the stellar density on an uniform grid with points spaced by 100 px . at each point of the grid",
    "the density is computed over a circle of radius @xmath132 arcmin .",
    "this choice provides a suitable degree of smoothing and minimizes the effects of possible small empty regions ( f.i , saturated stars or dead ccd columns ) .",

    "the isodensity contours up to 3.0 @xmath133 appear quite elongated but similar in shape and symmetrical . on the other hand",
    "the peak of density ( @xmath136;@xmath137 ) is clearly _ off - centered _ with respect to the center of symmetry of the outer contours ( @xmath138;@xmath139 ) .",
    "we note that the density contrast between the density peak and the last symmetric contour is larger than 4 @xmath28 , i.e. quite significant .",

    "the dotted contour ( corresponding to a density of 3.2 @xmath133 ) is reported to show that the substructures in the ne region of the galaxy that are clearly visible in the maps by @xcite and @xcite are present also in our sample but have a low density contrast with respect to the last symmetric contour , thus low statistical significance , as concluded also by @xcite .",
    "it is important to remark that the only other spheroidal galaxy of the local group that has a clearly off - centered density peak is the sagittarius dsph , whose structure is greatly strained by the galactic tidal field ( see * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite found significant asymmetry in the distribution of stars along the major axis .",

    "17 the @xmath142 distribution of draco is presented .",
    "the observed distribution is very well reproduced by its template : the characteristic clustering scale is @xmath150 px @xmath151 and no star with clustering scale shorter than the cut - off ( @xmath152 px ) is observed . on the other hand , the @xmath142 distribution of umi ( shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "17 ) is quite different from that of draco and from the smooth / symmetric templates .",
    "the major peak and the cut - off are well reproduced by the corresponding template but _ there is a clear secondary peak at shorter scale lenghts with respect to the main cut - off_. the presence of this secondary peak shows that there are _ two characteristic scales of clustering _ in umi , a longer one ( @xmath153 px @xmath154 ) associated with the general properties of the system and a shorter one ( @xmath155 px @xmath156 ) associated with the more compact structures corresponding , to the off - centered density peak .",
    "can the observed @xmath142 distribution of umi arise by chance ( i.e. small number fluctuations ) from an intrinsically smooth and unstructured system ? to answer this question we extracted 1000 random samples from the model assumed for the umi template shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "17 and for each of them we computed the fraction of stars having @xmath142 lower than the observed cut - off ( @xmath157 , hereafter @xmath158 , for brevity ) , fixed at @xmath159 px .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath158 of the simulated samples is shown in fig .",
    "the observed fraction ( @xmath160 ) is indicated by a dotted line .",
    "18 shows that ( a ) in no case a sample having @xmath158 equal or greater than the observed value has been extracted from the unstructured model , ( b ) the highest @xmath158 value reached by a simulation ( @xmath161 ) is significantly lower than the observed one , and ( c ) 95 % of the simulated samples have @xmath162 . we conclude that _ the observed presence of two characteristic clustering scales is a real and statistically significant property of umi_.    finally , we find that the spread in magnitude of the blue hbs of draco and umi are small and compatible with the observational scatter at that magnitude .",
    "thus we ca nt see any sign of the significant elongation along the line of sight that was required in the model by @xcite to explane the large velocity dispersion observed in dsph galaxies without the need of massive dark matter halos ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the distance estimates to draco and umi derived in  4 are tied to the distance scale introduced by f99 and compatible with the trgb scale introduced by @xcite .",
    "the f99 scale is fully consistent with the scale based on the revised hipparcos parallaxes by @xcite .",
    "f99 showed that their distance moduli of globular clusters are tipically @xmath163 mag larger than those tied to traditional @xmath164 $ ] calibrating relation .",
    "this is probably the main reason why we find distance moduli for umi and draco that are larger by @xmath165 mag than what generally found in literature ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we note also that , independently of the distance scale , our procedure of hb matching leads to results that are in excellent agreement with works based on the rr lyrae ( e.g. , n88 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while a sensible mismatch is noticed with respect to the main sequence fitting technique adopted by @xcite , using hst data .",
    "we argue that the problems with the absolute photometric calibration of hst - wfpc2 data may be at the origin of the observed differences .    the comparison with the recent distance estimates by @xcite ( for draco ) and @xcite ( for umi ) is of particular interest .",
    "@xcite derived a distance modulus to draco by ( 1 ) estimating @xmath166 from the observed hb and ( 2 ) by adopting the classical @xmath167 $ ] relation by @xcite .",
    "they obtain @xmath168 , compatible with our estimate within the uncertainties , but their final distance modulus ( @xmath169 ) is 0.34 mag smaller than ours",
    ". however , if the above quoted systematic difference of @xmath163 mag between the f99 distance scale and the scale by @xcite is taken into account the consistency between the two estimates is clearly recovered . on the other hand , @xcite derived the mean level of rr lyrae in umi by a comparison with template globular cluster of similar metallicity , i.e. the same method adopted here .",
    "moreover , the distance moduli of the template clusters were taken from @xcite who derived them from main sequence fitting to hipparcos subdwarfs . with this approach",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath170 and @xmath171 in _ excellent _ agreement with our results .    independently of the above considerations , it is important to remark that the actual uncertainty on state - of - the - art distance estimates to draco and umi remains @xmath172 % , in spite of all efforts .",
    "it is clear that classical distance indicators are unefficient in this context and valid alternatives are certainly needed .",
    "the search for detached double - lined eclipsing binaries ( dd - eb ) is now possible with new generation instruments and may be very rewarding , given the high binary fraction that has been reported for these two galaxies @xcite .",
    "the metallicity distributions presented here confirm ( with larger samples , with respect to existing spectroscopic surveys ) that the stellar populations of both galaxies have a sizeable spread in metal content . since they are dominated by very old stars",
    ", we shall conclude that significant self - enrichment took place in these systems in a quite short time scale ( i.e. , few gyr ) at very early epochs .",
    "the same conclusions have been previously reached for sculptor @xcite and sextans @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that some of the stars of umi , dra and sex show abundance patterns significantly different from those typical of galactic halo stars .",
    "in particular it has been suggested @xcite that the transition from an @xmath127 -enhanced regime to nearly solar @xmath173 $ ] ratios occurred at a much lower [ fe / h ] value than in our own galaxy .",
    "this evidence led @xcite to conclude that it is unlikely that systems like umi and draco gave a significant contribution to the assembly of the galactic halo .",
    "we remark here that this conclusion is correct only for satellites that would have been accreted by the milky way in an advanced stage of their chemical evolution . a very early accretion ( i.e. , within @xmath174 gyr from the onset of star formation ) or simply a very early stripping of the gaseous component by the galaxy would nt leave any peculiar chemical signature in a galactic halo largely composed by building blocks like draco , umi or sextans ( as they were in their first gyr of `` stellar '' life ) .",
    "our results show also that , while the average metallicity of the two galaxy is similar , the difference in the mds is significant .",
    "the md of umi peaks at @xmath6\\simeq -1.9 $ ] and barely reaches @xmath6\\simeq -1.6 $ ] while that of draco peaks at @xmath6\\simeq -1.6 $ ] and reaches @xmath6\\simeq -1.3 $ ] .",
    "this fact has to be taken into account , in particular in the interpretation of the great difference in hb morphology between the two galaxies .",
    "dra and umi _ are not _ a good `` second parameter pair '' ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) : a sizeable part of the hb morphology difference may be due to the differences in the actual md .",
    "the large population of binaries ( and blue stragglers ) hosted by the galaxies @xcite may also be have some impact on the observed hb morphology , especially in the case of draco ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "draco and umi have similar distance from the center of the galaxy , similar luminous mass and similar star formation histories .",
    "both are thought to have high m / l ratios and probably have also similar orbits , since they have similar radial velocities and ( possibly ) proper motions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in spite of that",
    ", while draco shows a very symmetrical and smooth profile out to a very large distance from the center @xcite , we have demonstrated that _ even the innermost regions _ of umi are strongly structured and asymmetrical .",
    "the presence of a massive and extended cdm halo should have inhibited the formation of any significant substructure in the stellar component of umi .",
    "the star formation activity can not be responsible of the disturbed structure of this galaxy since significant star formation episodes have ceased many gyr ago .",
    "furthermore we accurately checked for possible differences in the stellar populations between the off - centered ( and nearly round ) density peak of umi and its outer regions and we found none .",
    "@xcite showed that a small self - gravitating stellar system is embedded into the main body of the peculiar globular cluster @xmath106 cen .",
    "this stellar system has likely managed to preserve its individuality over many gyr , while orbiting into the stellar halo of the cluster .",
    "a similar possibility could be envisaged also to explain the origin of the peculiar density peak of umi .",
    "the process of hyerarchical merging is expected to be scale - free , thus the records of the formation of a galaxy like umi from smaller fragments may be still detectable today ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , possibly favoured by the fact that the putative fragment we are considering is much denser than the stellar medium it is embedded in .",
    "the main argument against this hypothesis is the already reported observational evidence that the stellar population in the density peak does not differ from the average umi population ( as opposite to the @xmath106 cen case , see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "large high - resolution spectroscopic surveys may possibly provide more stringent indications on the viability of this scenario .",
    "while we are writing , a new preprint was posted @xcite in which our results about the structure of umi are fully confirmed .",
    "furthermore @xcite were able to follow the structure of umi out to a distance of @xmath175 deg from the center and demonstrated that ( 1 ) the galaxy is elongated along the direction of its proper motion vector and ( 2 ) the outer isodensity contours of umi have the typical s - shape of tidally disturbed stellar systems .",
    "if it will be spectroscopically confirmed that the stars in the s - shaped structures are unbound , or the signature of apparent rotation will be found , this would directly disprove a specific prediction of the cdm simulations @xcite . in any case , the strongly disturbed structure of umi provides a severe challenge to standard cdm scenarios , above all if the comparison with draco is considered .",
    "moreover , @xcite showed that previous estimates of the total luminosity of umi had missed a significant amount of light that is found at large distances from the center of the galaxy .",
    "their estimate of total luminosity is 2.7 times larger than previous ones . taking this into account and considering the ( possible ) effects of anisotropic velocity dispersions they were able to reduce the mass to light ratio of umi down to @xmath176 . if we include in this computation the effects of our larger distance modulus ( and assuming @xmath177 , after * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we obtain @xmath178 , just a factor @xmath179 4 larger than the typical m / l of ordinary globular clusters .    from the above discussion",
    "it appear that further observational and theoretical efforts are still needed to fully understand the nature of umi and draco .",

    "<S> we present @xmath0 photometry of two wide ( @xmath1 arcmin@xmath2 ) fields centered on the low surface brightness dwarf spheroidal galaxies draco and ursa minor . </S>",

    "<S> we detect for the first time the rgb - bump in the luminosity function of umi ( @xmath5 ) while the feature is not detected in draco . </S>",
    "<S> photometric metallicity distributions are obtained for the two galaxies and an accurate analysis to determine the intrinsic metallicity spread is performed by means of artificial stars experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the adopted method is insensitive to stars more metal poor than @xmath6\\sim -2.5 $ ] and it rests on the assumpion that the age spread in the considered populations is small ( i.e. the impact of the actual age spread on the colors of the rgb stars is negligible ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , while the average metallicity of the two galaxies is similar ( @xmath7>_{umi } = -1.8 $ ] and @xmath7>_{dra } = -1.7 $ ] ) the metallicity distributions are significantly different , having different peak values ( @xmath6_{umi}^{mod } = -1.9 $ ] and @xmath6_{dra}^{mod } = -1.6 $ ] ) and different maximum metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that such differences may be partly responsible for the difference in hb morphology between the two galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic metallicity @xmath8 spread is @xmath9 in umi and @xmath10 in draco . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the inner region of umi is significantly structured , at odds with what expected for a system in dynamical equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we show that the main density peak of umi is off - centered with respect to the center of symmetry of the whole galaxy and it shows a much lower ellipticity with respect to the rest of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , umi stars are shown to be clustered according to two different characteristic clustering scales , as opposite to draco , which instead has a very symmetric and smooth density profile . </S>",
    "<S> the possible consequences of this striking structural difference on our ideas about galaxy formation are briefly discussed . combining our distance modulus with the more recent estimates of the total luminosity of umi </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the mass to light ( m / l ) ratio of this galaxy may be as low as @xmath11 , a factor 5 - 10 lower than current estimates . </S>"
