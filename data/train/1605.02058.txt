    "an early attempt to unify theories of gravitation and electromagnetism was realized by kaluza  @xcite in five - dimensional theory based on classical general relativity .",
    "that was later extended by klein  @xcite with quantum interpretations .",
    "the idea of extra dimensions played a key role in development of an existing new fundamental theory of physics , superstring theory ( m - theory ) which requires the spacetime to have ten ( eleven ) dimensions .",
    "braneworld models were proposed in order to tackle the hierarchy problem .",
    "the question why there is such a large gap between the electroweak scale at @xmath0 tev and the planck scale at @xmath1 tev has been addressed in  @xcite .",
    "the first string realization of low - scale gravity and braneworld models were given , pointing out the motivation of tev strings from the stabilization of mass hierarchy and the graviton emission in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "randall and sundrum proposed their braneworld models  @xcite where the hierarchy problem can be addressed , as the large size of the extra dimension plays crucial role to fill the gap between the electroweak and planck effective scales . according to the randall - sundrum model ,",
    "our universe is a three - brane ( domain wall ) embedded in five - dimensional bulk spacetime ; one extra dimension is large , and the bulk is a slice of the anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime , i.e. , spacetime with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "later , this model was further extended by shiromizu et al .",
    "reissner - nordstrm - like static , a spherically symmetric black hole solution with a tidal charge parameter ( instead of electric charge ) , localized on a three - brane in five - dimensional gravity in the randall - sundrum model was obtained , without finding the bulk metric , by dadhich et al .",
    "so far , several black hole solutions  @xcite , wormholes  @xcite , and nonuniform stars and gravastars  @xcite in the randall - sundrum model have been obtained ( see reviews  @xcite and references therein . ) .",
    "the discovery of the braneworld model opens up a new window to test modified general relativity .",
    "thus , up to now , many physical effects related to test the particle motion and geodesic structure of braneworld black holes  @xcite and neutron and compact stars  @xcite have been studied .",
    "one of the most important properties of black holes is their characteristic oscillations , which are called _ quasinormal modes _ that carry information about them .",
    "the quasinormal modes determine , e.g. , ringdown of gravitational waves created while a black hole is born .",
    "they are characterized by black hole parameters being dependent on initial perturbations .",
    "they have complex frequencies  real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal frequencies represent frequencies of the real oscillations and their dissipation rate , respectively .",
    "recently , the interferometric ligo detectors have measured the first ever gravitational wave signals from the merging of two black holes  @xcite .",
    "later , it has been shown that current precision of the experiment leaves some possibilities for alternative theories of gravity  @xcite .",
    "cardoso et al .",
    "@xcite stated that ringdown waveforms indicate the existence of the stable light rings regardless of existence of the horizons . according to  @xcite ,",
    "the ringdown part of the gw150914 signal has excluded formation of gravastar by the merger of two rotating compact objects .",
    "so far , characteristic ringdown signals ( quasinormal modes ) of the various black holes have been studied in great detail by a number of authors within perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "since there is still room open for alternative theories of gravity , we aim to study in this paper perturbations of the black holes localized in the randall - sundrum braneworld .",
    "we concentrate on their stabilities , scattering effects and quasinormal modes .",
    "after this work was almost completed , electromagnetic perturbations of current braneworld solution by molina et al .",
    "@xcite appeared in arxiv .",
    "despite the fact that some our results of the quasinormal frequencies of the electromagnetic perturbations are repeating the results of  @xcite , we keep them in order to compare them with profiles of scalar and gravitational perturbations .",
    "moreover , we study scattering and absorption problem in the electromagnetic case as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec - spacetime ] we briefly describe the spacetime geometry and its main properties . in section",
    "[ sec - pert - eqs ] the equations for scalar , electromagnetic , and axial and polar gravitational perturbations are introduced .",
    "we give some numerical results , such as quasinormal frequencies obtained by the sixth order wkb method in low and large multipole number limits , and stability analysis in section  [ results ] . in section  [ scattering ]",
    "classical scattering problem is solved by using the standard @xmath2-matrix . in section  [ absorption ]",
    "we study absorption cross section of massless scalar waves by the braneworld black hole in comparison with the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm black holes",
    ". finally , we present some concluding remarks in section  [ summary ] . throughout the paper we use the geometric system of units @xmath3 and a spacelike signature @xmath4 .",
    "we focus on the static , spherically symmetric black hole geometry localized on a braneworld , described by the line element  @xcite [ metric ] ds^2=-f(r)dt^2++r^2d^2+r^2 ^ 2d^2  , where [ lapse ] f(r)=1-+  , and @xmath5 is a constant parameter .",
    "one can see from  ( [ lapse ] ) that if @xmath6 the spacetime metric ( [ metric ] ) reduces to the schwarzschild one .",
    "moreover , for @xmath7 the spacetime metric ( [ metric ] ) is identical to the reissner - nordstrm black hole one with two horizons which both are smaller than the one of the schwarzschild black hole ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "however , in the braneworld @xmath5 can have negative value ( @xmath9 ) too . in this case ,",
    "black hole has only one horizon which is always bigger than the one of the schwarzschild black hole [ horizon ] r_+=m+ > 2 m  . in this paper we consider the latter case , @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , in order to guarantee its negativity we introduce new notation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is always positive , @xmath12 , and is called _ tidal charge ( brane tension ) parameter _  @xcite .    black hole entropy is determined by horizon area as [ entropy ] s==r_+^2=(m+)^2  . where @xmath13 is horizon area .",
    "the hawking temperature is given by [ temperature ] t=  .",
    "as one see from ( [ temperature ] ) , unlike in the case of the reissner - nordstrm black hole , that the nonvanishing tidal charge parameter leads to an increase of the black hole entropy and decrease of the hawking temperature .",
    "by considering perturbation terms dependent on time as @xmath14 and separating angular and radial perturbations by introducing the tortoise coordinate @xmath15 , we obtain a schrdinger - like wave equation as follows : [ ax-5 ] ( + ^2)z_s = v_s z_s  , where @xmath16 represent scalar and electromagnetic perturbations , respectively . for the massive scalar perturbations with mass @xmath17 of the black hole on the brane we have the potential [ scalar - potential ] v_0&=&f&=&f  , where prime ( `` @xmath18 '' ) denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath19 . here , @xmath20 is the multipole number which represents the spherical harmonic index and takes only nonnegative integers for scalar perturbations .    for the electromagnetic perturbations the potential reads [ em - potential ] v_1=f where the multipole number @xmath20 for electromagnetic perturbations takes only natural numbers .",
    "the potentials for the scalar  ( [ scalar - potential ] ) and electromagnetic  ( [ em - potential ] ) perturbations can be written in a compact form as [ scalar - em ] v_s = f  . where @xmath21 and @xmath22 correspond to the scalar and electromagnetic perturbations , respectively .",
    "of course , in the case of the electromagnetic perturbations in the standard situations we assume massless photons , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "it is well known that the simplest way of studying the gravitational perturbations around black holes is to introduce the first order perturbations .",
    "if the considered black hole is not a vacuum solution of the einstein equations , the perturbation equations are governed by the equation @xmath24 . in the case of a black hole localized on a three - brane in five - dimensional gravity ,",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are the ricci tensor and the projection of the five - dimensional weyl tensor on the brane , respectively .",
    "the gravitational perturbations of the higher dimensional black holes can be easily obtained by using the master equations presented in  @xcite .",
    "however , the black hole solution in the brane  @xcite was found without finding the 5-dimensional bulk metric .",
    "therefore , we adopt the simplifying assumption @xmath27 that can be justified at least in a region where the perturbation energy does not exceed the threshold of the kaluza - klein massive modes  @xcite . moreover , the fact that the gravitational perturbative field can not travel deep into the bulk  @xcite supports the above assumption .    in this subsection we present a general formalism for gravitational perturbations in a static , spherically symmetric background , following chandrasekhar s method  @xcite . with the notation @xmath28 , the spherically symmetric ,",

    "we have calculated the quasinormal frequencies of these perturbations .",
    "results have shown that with increasing tidal charge parameter the frequency of the real oscillations decreases while damping rate increases , unlike the case of the standard reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "the reflection probability of the wave by the scalar potential barrier is larger than for the electromagnetic and gravitational ones ; i.e. , scalar fields are the most favorite in terms of reflection of waves , while the gravitational fields are the most favorite in terms of transmission of waves . with increasing tidal charge parameter reflection abilities of the perturbative fields decrease , as the radii of the horizon and the photon sphere increase with the tidal charge .",
    "however , we should note that because of no upper limit on the value of the tidal charge parameter , black holes on the brane always have event horizons and photon spheres which are located further away from the central object in comparison to the schwarzschild ones .",
    "we have studied also the absorption cross section of the massless scalar waves by the braneworld black hole in the low- and high - frequency regimes .",
    "calculations have shown that the braneworld black holes always have bigger absorption cross sections than the corresponding ones related to the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm black holes .",

    "<S> we study scalar , electromagnetic , axial and polar gravitational perturbations of the four - dimensional reissner - nordstrm - like black holes with a _ tidal charge _ in the randall - sundrum braneworld in the first approximation when the tidal perturbations are not taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the quasinormal modes of these perturbations have been studied in both normal and eikonal regimes . </S>",
    "<S> calculations have shown that the black holes on the randall - sundrum brane are stable against all kinds of perturbations . moreover , we determine the greybody factor , giving transmission and reflection of the scattered waves through the effective potentials . it has been shown that the scalar perturbative fields are the most favorite to reflect the wave as compared to the other fields . with increasing value of the tidal charge , the ability of the all perturbative potentials to reflect the waves decreases . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations in low- and high - frequency regimes have shown that black holes on the braneworld always have a bigger absorption cross section of massless scalar waves than the schwarzschild and standard reissner - nordstrm black holes . </S>"
