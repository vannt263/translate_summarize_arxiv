    "we are interested in the description of the transport of electrons in a single graphene layer .",
    "this material is a two - dimensional flat monolayer of carbon atoms which displays unusual and interesting electronic properties arising from the bi - conically shaped fermi surfaces near the brillouin zone corners ( dirac points ) .",
    "the electrons propagate as massless dirac fermions moving with the fermi velocity @xmath0 , which is @xmath1 times smaller than the speed of light @xmath2 , and their behavior reproduces the physics of quantum electrodynamics but at much smaller energy scale .",
    "although this model has been studied for a long time , see @xcite for a bibliography , it has remained theoretical until the work of @xcite where the graphene was produced for the first time .",
    "after these results , the interest of researchers on this material has shown a remarkable increase including applications in carbon - based electronic devices @xcite and numerical simulations , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider a model of a two - dimensional dirac equation ( @xcite ) of a graphene sheet in the presence of an external potential .",
    "this model consists of a small parameter @xmath3 directly related to the planck constant .",
    "we are interested is the design of an efficient numerical method  the surface hopping method for the graphene dirac equation in the semiclassical regime where @xmath4 . in this regime ,",
    "the solution of the dirac equation is highly oscillatory thus a huge computational cost is required to give accurate wave functions or physical observables for either finite difference methods ( @xcite , @xcite ) or time - splitting spectral method @xcite , since one needs to resolve the high frequency both spatially and temporally .",
    "the development of efficient numerical methods for the related schrdinger equation in the semiclassical regime has motivated many works in the last decade , see the review paper @xcite and references therein .",
    "in the semiclassical regime , one often uses asymptotic analysis , such as the wkb analysis and the wigner transform to help to reduce the computational costs and to develop efficient computational methods based on the asymptotic models . in the framework of wigner transform ,",
    "the idea is to construct a measure on the phase space , called the wigner measure , when @xmath5 , to obtain the physical observables ( such as density , flux , and energy ) with a computational cost far less than a direct quantum simulation .",
    "when the gap between different energy levels is of order one ( the so - called _ adiabatic _ case ) , the wigner measure technique provides a simple description of the motion : it can be well approximated by a fully diagonalized system , one classical liouville equation for each energy level @xcite .",
    "however , in the graphene dirac equation , the energy levels _ cross _ at the dirac points , where _ non - adiabatic _ transfers are observed and the particles can tunnel from one band to the other .",
    "the standard wigner approach then needs to be revised to describe the non - adiabatic phenomena .",
    "one of the widely used approaches to simulate the non - adiabatic dynamics is the surface hopping method initially proposed by tully and preston @xcite as an efficient computational method to go beyond the classical born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "this method is widely used in chemistry and molecular dynamics , see for examples @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to combine the classical transports of the system on individual potential energy surfaces with instantaneous transitions from one energy surface to the other .",
    "the transition rates for this band - to - band hopping are given by the well known landau - zener formula @xcite . from the mathematical point of view , the first rigorous analysis of non - adiabatic transfer using landau - zener formula dates back to hagedorn @xcite .",
    "more recently , the wigner measure techniques for separated energy levels have been extended in @xcite and @xcite to systems presenting band crossing . the proof is based on microlocal analysis to justify the landau - zener formula .",
    "departing from the results in @xcite and @xcite , a rigorous surface hopping algorithm in the wigner picture was proposed in @xcite for time - dependent two - level schrdinger systems with conically intersecting eigenvalues and implemented numerically in the lagrangian formulation in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding eulerian numerical scheme was proposed in @xcite by formulating the hopping mechanism as an interface condition which is then built into the numerical flux for solving the underlying liouville equation for each energy level .    in the present article",
    "we give a lagrangian surface hopping algorithm for the graphene dirac equation similar to the algorithm in @xcite .",
    "first , it is a classical result that the wigner transform leads to two decoupled classical liouville equations for each energy level , under the adiabatic assumption @xcite . at the dirac points where non - adiabatic transition occurs , we first derive the landau - zener formula , and then incorporate it into the surface hopping algorithm .",
    "we also show that a reduced asymptotic model developed in @xcite could give incorrect transition probability .",
    "we then compare through several numerical examples the solutions of the dirac equation ( solved by the time - splitting spectral method ) , the surface hopping algorithm and the asymptotic models of @xcite .",
    "our numerical results show that , when there is no wave interference , the surface hopping algorithm indeed gives the correct non - adiabatic transition at dirac points , with a much greater computational efficiency compared with the simulations based on solving directly the dirac equation .    the article is organized as follows : in section [ sec_pb ] we give the graphene dirac equation and its semiclassical limit via the wigner transform in the adiabatic case .",
    "we give some examples of potentials to show that non - adiabatic transition is indeed possible . in section [ sec_non_ad_tr ]",
    ", we derive the landau - zener transition probability for the graphene dirac equation .",
    "the surface hopping algorithm is given in section [ sec_alg ] . in section [ sec_thmo ]",
    ", we study the asymptotic models introduced in @xcite and show that a reduced model could give the incorrect transition probability .",
    "numerical results are given in section [ sec_numres ] for comparisons of different models .",
    "for reader s convenience we give the time - splitting spectral method of the dirac equation in appendix [ sec_dsol ] .",
    "we consider the description of the transport of electrons in a single graphene layer in the presence of an external potential .",
    "following @xcite , it is modelled by the two dimensional dirac equation : @xmath6\\psi , & t\\in{i\\!\\!r } , \\ , x\\in{i\\!\\!r}^2",

    "we consider the system in the semiclassical regime .",
    "for this purpose , we rewrite the equations such that there remains only one dimensionless parameter @xmath3 . proceeding as in @xcite , we change the variables to dimensionless variables as follows @xmath17 and define @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a reference length and @xmath20 .",
    "we remark that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are chosen such that the change of variable preserves the normalization and . plugging into , and dividing by the reference energy @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the effective mass of the electron ,",

    "the operator @xmath44 is essentially self - adjoint on the hilbert space @xmath48 and the domain of its self - adjoint extension is @xmath49 .",
    "therefore @xmath50 generates a strongly continuous group of unitary operators solution to .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath51 of the symbol @xmath52 satisfy @xmath53 at the crossing set @xmath54 .",
    "the semiclassical limit away from the crossing set was performed in @xcite for systems of the form with more general symbols and initial data @xmath55 subject to additional conditions . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors show that the semiclassical limit for the different bands can be treated separately where , for each band , the related eigenvalue plays the role of a scalar classical hamiltonian .",
    "+      we recall now some basic notions of the wigner analysis involved in the semiclassical limit . for @xmath56 ,",
    "the wigner transform is defined by : @xmath57 and for @xmath58 , the @xmath30 wigner matrix is defined by : @xmath59 = \\left ( w^h(u_i , u_j ) \\right)_{1\\leq i , j \\leq 2}\\,.\\ ] ] we denote by @xmath60=\\textrm{tr}\\,w^h[u]$ ] the scalar wigner transform of @xmath61 . for any bounded sequence @xmath62 in @xmath63 ,",

    "indeed , the decoupled semiclassical limit is valid on a set of the phase space which is stable under the flow @xmath73 and where no band crossing occurs .",

    "then , system becomes : @xmath106 unlike in section [ seq_u0 ] , non - adiabatic transfer may occur .",
