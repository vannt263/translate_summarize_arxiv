    "we take up a model with a non - negative potential having two minima , so all static solutions with finite energy splits into disjoint classes , so called topological sectors , according to their asymptotic behavior at extremely large @xmath8 .",
    "solutions with @xmath9 are called topological , while those with @xmath10  nontopological . both types of the solutions are of growing interest in physics . in particular , they arise in the questions of three- or two - dimensional domain walls . however",
    ", a one - dimensional case also is curious and it was considered in different works for diverse models @xcite . in the @xmath2 model there is a soliton solution called a kink , in @xcite , @xcite a phenomenon of `` wobbling kink '' was studied .",
    "moreover , a three- or two - dimensional domain wall presents a one - dimensional kink interpolating two different vacua of the model . in some cases for considering models the approximate methods",

    "it can be easily found by solving static equation : @xmath14 the antikink @xmath15 is given as minus @xmath16 .",

    "the long - living solutions with high amplitude are of growing interest in classical field theory .",
    "this type of solutions , called bion or breather , was found early in the kink - antikink collisions in the @xmath1 model both in one- @xcite and three- dimensional cases @xcite .    we propose a method `` cut and match '' to find a long - living field configuration with using previously found solutions @xmath13 , and of the equation . in this case a part of initial state is composed of the kink , which is divided for two equal pieces at @xmath47 .",
    "these halves of the kink are fixed at @xmath48 .",
    "then , one of the solutions ( @xmath13 or @xmath49 on the finite interval ) of is placed in the space between these two halves .",
    "an initial state , which is composed in described manner , is shown by figure [ fig : sec3pic1 ] .",
    "note , that if we take @xmath13 , the initial state will become unstable .",

    "in other case we take a solution in terms of elliptic solution for fixed value @xmath25 . for a smooth screed of selected solutions",
    "one defines the value of @xmath51 as a half of the period @xmath52 of the elliptic function @xmath49 .",
    "thus we obtain an initial configuration @xmath53 . in the following text",
    "the definition @xmath54 means : in the area @xmath55 the initial state consists of a half of , in @xmath56  ( there @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) , and in the area @xmath60 the solution consists of a second part of .",
    "there @xmath52 is a period of elliptic function .",
    "the profile of this type of initial state is shown in the figure [ fig : sec3pic1 ] ( for @xmath61 ) .",
    "firstly , we consider a `` static initial state '' ( @xmath62 ) , but later we take into account some configurations with dynamics : @xmath63     for @xmath61 . ]",
    "* numerical solution of the equation of motion*. we solve the partial differential equation with convergent difference scheme with non - fixed boundary conditions , while derivatives are approximated by finite differences .",
    "the steps are taken as follows @xmath64 ( space step ) and @xmath65 ( time step ) , the equation is solved from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "this choice of steps helps to optimize a ratio accuracy of the obtained results and the duration of computing . during the evolution",
    "a check of law of conservation of energy is conducted , taking into account a flow of energy from fixed boundaries .",
    "the initial states are compiled with the use of the computer algebra system mathematica 8 .",
    "first of all , the initial condition consists of two halves of the kink , placed in @xmath48 , and unstable zero solution @xmath13 between them",
    ". the energy increases linearly with growing value of @xmath51 .",
    "two parts in the evolution are observed .",
    "firstly , there is a convergence of both halves of kink with velocity equals the speed of light . when the halves finally meet each other , two processes alternate : a formation of loops and an emission of waves from the kink ( so called , `` wobbling kink '' ) .",
    "the obtained solution @xmath69 is close to linearized solution of equation , where @xmath70 , which lives very long and is characterized by small emission of waves .",
    "these waves carry off some energy from the area of localization .",
    "let s explain this phenomenon .",
    "at small values of @xmath71 the solution changes from @xmath72 to @xmath73 . as the @xmath74 is a periodic function , when @xmath75 the initial condition ( with loops ) comes not as an exciting of excited mode of elliptic function , but as an exciting of highly - amplitude vibration of a kink solution .",
    "so the evolution of the initial state can be described qualitatively by @xmath76 the evolution can be described by as there are two modes in the kinks spectrum .",
    "one of them , which correlates with , is responsible for small vibrations across the solution .",
    "there is an idea , that the observed vibrations stop being small , but still can be described with similar periodic function as @xmath77 ( we take @xmath78  like in ) . in the parameter @xmath79 is taken as constant .",
    "but in the numerical simulations it is nt a constant as there is a small emission from area of localisation of solution .",
    "moreover , there is one precondition to describe qualitatively an obtained solution precisely with .",
    "the function equals zero in @xmath47 one time , if @xmath80 , and three times , if @xmath81 .",
    "note , that a quasi - periodic formation of the loops with period equals @xmath82  it is also one reason for using proposed phenomenological description .",
    "this period correlates with @xmath83 : @xmath84    in @xcite is shown , that considering such substitution as @xmath85 in the equation in the quadratic approximation by @xmath86 gives us asymptotically stable solution .",
    "its large amplitude vibrations are characterized by strong suppression . at figures [ fig : sec3lev1pic3 ] and [ fig : sec3lev1pic5 ]",
    "two parts of evolution and a comparison with analytical solution are shown for two chosen moments of time .    at high values of @xmath51",
    "the observed loops in the evolution are characterized by not small amplitudes . in this case the final states of evolution can be identify with the elliptic solution @xmath49 between two halves of kink .        in previous works",
    "a long - living configuration has been found , so called bion @xcite .",
    "however , an analytical description of the observed process has not been given . in our work",
    "we take an initial condition @xmath89 , composed of one half - kink k and one half - antikink @xmath90 and a half of period of @xmath49 with fixed @xmath30 .",
    "this initial state is dynamical ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "we obtain long - living state with oscillation of an amplitude of @xmath92 at @xmath47 ( figure [ fig : sec3lev2pic1 ] ) .",
    "the observing oscillations in terms of an amplitude @xmath93 are called a regular bion .",
    "also , it can be considered as a new form of description of early found bion @xcite .",
    "we take an initial condition @xmath53 for @xmath95 ( for smoother stitching ) , while the observed evolution does not qualitatively depend on @xmath30 .",
    "further , for example , we show the results for the case @xmath61 .",
    "we find two steps in the evolution : external ( a loop of high amplitude formation ) and internal ( a highly deformed kink ) . after some time the loops continue their forming with smaller amplitude .",
    "after these 4  5 cycles the external step disappears and the solution starts to be presented by long - living excited kink with the wave packet emission from the area of localization . this phenomenon is called a `` wobbling kink '' . this state is a final step of the evolution , which is observed for other variants of initial states .",
    "the profiles of @xmath3 for @xmath61 at some particular time are shown at figures [ fig : sec3lev2bpic1 ] and [ fig : sec3lev2bpic3 ] .",
    "an addition of @xmath88 to the initial state of the configuration @xmath53 leads to a faster reduction of the amplitude . at low values of @xmath96 the loops",
    "for the first time during the evolution the kink - antinkink pairs k@xmath15 turn up .",
    "this phenomenon has a threshold .",
    "the increase of @xmath97 gives us a qualitatively new type of the evolution ( @xmath98 for @xmath99 ) . in the system",
    "the next transition happens : @xmath100 in the center of the configuration a topological number is changing .",
    "a transition is shown at figure [ fig : sec3lev2dpic4 ] for @xmath101 .",
    "the next increasing of @xmath97 ( @xmath102 for @xmath99 ) gives us the next transition @xmath103 now we observe a saving of topological number in the center .",
    "these transitions are observed for different @xmath30 .",
    "the transition is shown at figure [ fig : sec3lev2dpic5 ] for @xmath104 .",
    "we expect that with increasing the value of @xmath97 the similar qualitative changes will be observed in the initial conditions of the evolution of initial state .",
    "we study the new long - living solutions in classical field theory model @xmath2 in @xmath4 dimensions .    in this work we use the special method for forming of initial state for numerical simulations",
    " the method `` cut and match '' .",
    "using this method gives us new long - living solutions both for vacuum solutions and solutions with nontrivial topological number .    in previous work",
    "@xcite a long - living configuration was observed in the kink - antikink scattering .",
    "it was called a bion . in current work",
    "the method `` cut and match '' gives us an opportunity to inject qualitative new way to describe a bion formation .",
    "furthermore , the highly excited states of the kink are observed in a sector with nontrivial topological number .",
    "we find a number of ways to reset this energy from this state . except for emission of wave packet with small amplitude , firstly , an arising of the kink - antikink pairs is observed .",
    "this phenomenon can perceived as a way to energy reset . at the same time",
    "there is a change of the topological number of the kink , located in the central zone in the area . at lower excitation energies",
    "there is a long - living excited vibrational state of the kink .",
    "the phenomenon of a `` wobbling kink '' is final state all considered means of exciting . after some time this excited state of a kink turns to a linearized one , which was formerly known  a discrete mode of exciting kink .    despite the large number of new results , the method `` cut and match ''",
    "has a wide range of outstanding issues in the application of the @xmath2 model .",
    "in particular , more detailed study of the dynamic of the initial conditions for the case of @xmath88 will be interesting , because in the last case there is a phenomenon of the birth of new kink - antikink pairs .    in the conclusion",
    ", we would like to notice that this research , fist of all , can be useful in the field theory .",
    "but , also it can be useful in other area of physics .",
    "the obtained results can be applied in elementary particle physics , cosmology , astrophysics and physics of condensed matter . with a high probability",
    "we expect that the obtained solutions can be implemented in the early stages of the evolution of the universe .",
