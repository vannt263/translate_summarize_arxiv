    "we showed that the effective quantum correction factor decreases rapidly from 1 at @xmath143 to 1/2 at @xmath109 , and its behaviour with @xmath18 closely follows the approximate form @xmath144 obtained from our diagrammatic analysis . in the intermediate - coupling regime , with interaction strength @xmath17 comparable to the bandwidth , the renormalized spin stiffness was evaluated in the whole range of band fillings , and was found to rapidly crossover from negative to positive values with increasing hund s coupling , highlighting the strong role of orbital degeneracy and hund s coupling on the stability of the ferromagnetic state with respect to long wavelength fluctuations .",
    "we also obtained , for both the square and simple cubic lattices , the renormalized spin - wave energy dispersion @xmath127 for momenta along symmetry directions in the brillouin zone . while hund s coupling results in an enhancement of the magnon energy in the entire brillouin zone",
    ", the effect is particularly dramatic for long wavelength modes , which rapidly crossover from negative to positive energy .",
    "generalizing to the @xmath2 orbital case , an effective quantum parameter @xmath145 was obtained which , in analogy with @xmath1 for quantum spin systems and @xmath0 for the generalized hubbard model , plays the role of @xmath4 for quantum corrections in a band ferromagnet . for large @xmath2 , this quantum parameter decreases rapidly with the hund s coupling @xmath18 and saturates to @xmath0 as @xmath85 .",
    "this strong suppression of quantum corrections due to orbital degeneracy and hund s coupling is quite significant for the 3d transition - metal ferromagnets fe , co , ni , where @xmath124 . with @xmath146 , as considered in the recent rpa calculations for iron,@xcite we obtain a value of @xmath147 for the quantum parameter . while the smallness of this quantum correction parameter accounts for why rpa calculations of the spin stiffness for fe with realistic band structure yield values in close agreement with the measured value of 280 mev.@xmath125 , it also highlights the significant magnitude of the correlation - induced quantum corrections involved in the measured spin stiffness values for transition - metal ferromagnets ."
