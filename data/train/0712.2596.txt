    "recent experiments by liu et al .",
    "@xcite have probed the regime in which the diameter of the hollow cylinder is comparable to zero - temperature coherence of the superconductor .",
    "their results confirmed the prediction by de gennes  @xcite of the destruction of superconductivity in small rings for a certain regime of the external flux .",
    "liu et al .  raised the interesting and fundamental issues of what would happen if the circumference of the structure were to be smaller than the superconducting coherence length , as well as whether or not the ginzburg - landau approach would be valid in this regime .",
    "these issues make a microscopic treatment desirable .",
    "on the other hand , the single - electron aharonov - bohm oscillations in the resistance or persistent current in a clean metallic ring have period @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a related fundamental issue : as the radius of the ring becomes smaller , how would the single - particle @xmath1 period manifest itself in a little - parks type of experiment ?",
    "furthermore , does disorder affect the oscillation of critical temperature and the character of the transition between superconducting and normal states ?",
    "and if so , how ?",
    "these questions are not only of theoretical interest , but are also likely to be addressed experimentally , in view of recent progress in fabrication and experiments on small superconducting rings  @xcite .",
    "recent work by czajka et al .",
    "@xcite , involing the exact diagonalization of the hubbard model for small numbers of sites and the numerical solution of the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation , shows that impurities can play an important role if they are located such that pinned density waves are in phase with one another : charge - density - wave ( cdw ) order would then be enhanced and superconducting order reduced .",
    "they also found that the mean - field results obtained via the bdg equations are consistent with the exact diagonalization results , even in the small systems they studied .",

    "ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory is valid near the superconducting transition , as it is an expansion in powers of the superconducting order parameter",
    ". therefore it may not be applicable at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "moreover , the gl approach can not give a complete account of multi - connected geometries of small size , as it is a description of the center - of - mass wavefunction of the cooper pairs .",
    "for small rings , in addition to propagating around the circumference together , electrons in cooper pairs can split apart and rejoin , and this process is not included in the gl description . in this paper , we study the oscillations of the critical temperature of @xmath3-wave superconducting rings theoretically , via consideration of the microscopic bcs theory of superconductivity  @xcite , analyzed using gorkov s approach  @xcite .",
    "our central purpose is to address the issues raised by liu et al .",
    "@xcite and mentioned above .",
    "our focus is on the correction to the oscillations that is due to finiteness of the radius of the superconducting structure .",
    "we consider both the clean and dirty regimes , and in the latter regime we shall ignore any tendency towards cdw ordering by assuming that the significant configurations of the impurities are sufficiently random that any pinned density waves are not in phase with one another .",
    "we shall see the emergence of an @xmath1 oscillation in the critical temperature , as the radius becomes smaller , and we shall also see that the transition to the normal state can be either discontinuous or continuous in the clean limit but is always continuous in the dirty limit .",
    "the origin of the @xmath0 oscillations lies in the fact that a cooper pair carries charge @xmath4 , which when circumnavigating the ring acquires a phase @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the magnetic flux , linking the ring .",
    "the period in flux is thus @xmath0 ( with @xmath7 conveniently set to unity  @xcite ) .",
    "the emergence of @xmath1 oscillations for small rings is due to the additional process in which electrons in a cooper pair can , from time to time ( so to speak ) , separate , propagate separately , and rejoin , the two trajectories having a nonzero winding number relative to one another .",
    "this process , which can only occur for ring sizes comparable to or smaller than the cooper - pair size , induces an oscillation with period @xmath1 .",

    "<S> as a function of the magnetic flux threading the object , the little - parks oscillation in the critical temperature of a large - radius , thin - walled superconducting ring or hollow cylinder has a period given by @xmath0 , due to the binding of electrons into cooper pairs . on the other hand , the single - electron aharonov - bohm oscillation in the resistance or persistent current for a clean ( i.e.  ballistic ) normal - state system having the same topological structure has a period given by @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> a basic question is whether the little - parks oscillation changes its character , as the radius of the superconducting structure becomes smaller , and even comparable to the zero - temperature coherence length . </S>",
    "<S> we supplement a physical argument that the @xmath1 oscillations should also be exhibited with a microscopic analysis of this regime , formulated in terms of the gorkov approach to bcs theory . </S>",
    "<S> we see that , as the radius of the ring is made smaller , an oscillation in the critical temperature of period @xmath1 emerges , in addition to the usual little - parks @xmath0-period oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that in the clean limit there is a superconductor - normal transition at nonzero flux , as the ring radius becomes sufficiently small , and that the transition can be either continuous or discontinuous , depending on the radius and the external flux . in the dirty limit </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that the transition is rendered continuous , which results in continuous quantum phase transitions tuned by flux and radius . </S>"
