    "@xcite proposed a mechanism where massive ( @xmath08 @xmath1 ) ob stars could trigger a new wave of star formation ( sf ) that would not have occurred otherwise .",
    "this ` collect - and - collapse ' ( cc ) model showed that the expansion of an  region into a uniform interstellar medium ( ism ) can sweep up shells dense enough to collapse and form stars . a second proposed",
    "triggering mechanism is through radiation - driven implosion ( rdi ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that ionizing ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation impinging upon a cloud can compress clumps of ism to induce collapse . in their simulation ,",
    "uv photons were directed at a preexisting , gravitationally stable core ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) embedded in neutral ism ( @xmath4 @xmath3 ) . the resulting gas formed pillar - like structures with gravitationally unstable , sf cores at the tips , similar to what is observed in many star forming regions ( sfrs ) @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite investigated the effect of radiation on molecular clouds with turbulent gas . their  radiative round - up \" ( rr ) model produced star forming pillars from the turbulent gas with distinct differences in line - of - sight gas profiles compared to rdi .",
    "the observational signatures of triggered sf should differ depending on the dominant mode , but in general , evidence for triggered sf will show patterns in the distribution of molecular gas , the distribution of ysos , and the ages of ysos relative to the  regions .",
    "cc is a relatively slow process that takes on the order of a few myr , which creates _ massive _ clumps that can collapse to form massive stars or star clusters @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the  region triggers sf , which implies that ysos should be found within , or adjacent to , the clumps that form on the periphery of the bubbles @xcite .",
    "the cc model also predicts that ( in a uniform medium ) the collected shell will fragment at regular intervals and lead to uniformly distributed sf clumps @xcite . as the ionization front pushes outward , new stars should continue to form ( provided there is enough molecular material ) and leave behind older , more evolved ysos .",
    "observationally , this predicts a yso age gradient that can be used to identify cases of triggered sf . on the other hand , rdi can form young stellar objects ( ysos ) in just a few tenths of a myr , and the stars are intermediate mass , 17 @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "rr differs from typical cc models which assume a static , uniform medium , and unlike rdi models , does not require pre - existing cores of molecular material .",
    "the rr model forms sub - solar mass protostars on timescales similar to rdi ( @xmath5few @xmath6 yr ) .",
    "the stars formed in both cc and rr should have near - zero velocities relative to the expanding  shell because they formed out of ism already in motion .",
    "in rdi , the cores are formed before the expansion of the  region , and therefore the resultant ysos may have non - zero velocities with respect to the  shell .",
    "the uniqueness of individual sfrs make it difficult to attribute specific features to a given mode of triggered sf ( cc , rdi , or rr ) , however , the observational signatures mentioned above can be used to identify potential sites of triggered sf .",
    "this paper is the first in a series that will investigate triggered sf over a variety of galactic environments .",
    "our goal is to examine , in detail , the properties of the sfrs themselves to determine the input energy required for triggered sf to be an effective and efficient mechanism .",
    "this requires knowledge of the triggering and triggered populations , as well as the molecular cloud out of which they formed . to answer these questions",
    "we have gathered survey data from numerous sources , from the near - ir to the radio , to investigate the galactic sfr g38.9 - 0.4 .",
    "this region was chosen because it is relatively nearby ( 2.7 kpc ) and lies along an unconfused line of sight .",
    "it also appears to host bubbles at different evolutionary stages and may provide insight into the growth of  regions and the potential for triggered sf .",

    "the green circles and text mark the main features of the region and indicate the apertures used for estimating the total gas mass and radio continuum flux associated with each feature in subsequent sections .",
    "this region contains two prominent ir bubbles ( n  74 and n  75 ; @xcite ) , two cataloged star clusters ( # 15 and # 16 , hereafter mcm  15 and mcm  16 ; @xcite ) , an intermediate - mass sfr ( imsfr , iras 19012 + 0505 ; @xcite ) , an infrared dark cloud ( irdc ) msxdc g038.95 - 0.47 ( @xcite ; hereafter just irdc ) , and an  ultracompact embedded cluster \" ( ucec # 8 ; @xcite ) .",

    "we also discuss the yso mass function in relation to other studies and the possibility of triggered sf .",
    "a summary of conclusions is presented in section  [ concsec ] .",
    "one indicator of active and future sf is the presence of molecular gas . to characterize this component we use data from the boston university five college radio astronomy observatory galactic ring survey ( bu - fcrao grs ; @xcite ) , which targeted the @xmath7co  @xmath8 transition at 110.2 ghz with a beam fwhm of 46and velocity resolution of 0.21 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "@xmath7co  is much less abundant than h@xmath10 or @xmath11co and thus remains optically thin at higher densities .",
    "we extracted spatially averaged velocity spectra from the grs data cubes within n  74 , n  75 , cluster mcm  15 , and the known irdc . figure  [ velspec ] shows the 1d velocity spectrum for each region with mcm  15 as the black short - dashed line , n  75 as the orange solid line , n  74 as the blue dot - dashed line , the irdc as the green dotted line , and mcm  16 as the magenta , long - dashed line . the @xmath7co  brightness temperature peaks between 5.6  k and 10  k over the velocity range @xmath12 = 3942 km  s@xmath9  for all four regions , indicating abundant , probably related , molecular material over a small velocity interval .",
    "the peak velocities for each region increase slightly from north to south with a spread of about 3 km  s@xmath9  between the peaks .",
    "there is also low - level emission detected from 50  ",
    "65 km  s@xmath9  for each region .",
    "there is no morphological similarity between this emission and the ir features so it is likely to be unaffiliated diffuse ism .",
    "figure  [ channel ] is a six - panel @xmath7co  channel map for the sfr from 35 to 45 km  s@xmath9 , averaged every 2 km  s@xmath9 , overlaid on a glimpse 8  image .",
    "there is obvious spatial agreement between the molecular gas and ir emission .",
    "there is a strong peak coincident with mcm  15 at 36  38 km  s@xmath9  and a smooth transition across the image until another strong peak appears over the irdc at 43 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the 43 km  s@xmath9  panel also seems to show a @xmath7co  hole over the center of n  74 .",
    "this feature may be evidence for a massive star sweeping out molecular material .",
    "the smooth variation in @xmath7co  velocity across this region suggests that all of these features are affiliated with the same molecular complex at a common distance .",
    "we adopt an average velocity of 41 km  s@xmath9  for the molecular material and obtain near and far kinematic distances of 2.7 and 10.5 kpc , using the galactic rotation curve of @xcite .",
    "@xcite chose the near distance for the irdc based on the assumption that it must be closer than the bright ir emission in order to appear in silouhette . also , the ukidss images exhibit a noticeable decline in source counts coincident with irdcs relative to the field at large .",
    "near - ir source catalogs from the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; @xcite ) show 80  160 sources per square arcminute coincident with the irdcs , while the field away from the molecular shows typically shows over 400 sources per square arcminute .",
    "this indicates that a large fraction , up to 75% of sources are being obscured at the location of the molecular cloud . if the molecular cloud and associated ir features were at the far distance of 10.5 kpc , then the cloud would be behind a majority of the field stars and any decline in source counts would be much less noticeable .",
    "therefore , we adopt the near distance of 2.7 kpc for the entire region . the difference between the lowest and highest peak emission velocities for the individual regions in figure  [ velspec ]",
    "amounts less than 0.2 kpc in distance , which is less than the assumed error in kinematic distances which we take to be 15% .",
    "the observed velocity spread is consistent with observed internal velocity dispersions of molecular clouds of several km  s@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "we estimate the column density of the g38.9 - 0.4  molecular cloud from the grs @xmath7co  cube using the formula from @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the main beam brightness temperature in k and @xmath15 is the velocity range in km  s@xmath9 , for which we used 3545 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "this equation assumes a @xmath7co  excitation temperature of 10  k , which is consistent with the estimated average value for the cloud of 8.3 k @xcite .",
    "we then compute the total gas mass surface density , @xmath16 , in g  @xmath17  from @xmath7co  using the conversion factors r(@xmath11co/@xmath7co ) = 45 and x(@xmath11co / h@xmath10 ) = @xmath18 @xcite and multiplying by @xmath19 , the mean molecular weight ( 2.72 ; @xcite ) times the mass of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the total mass is the mass surface density summed over the physical size of an individual region , which was estimated using a distance of 2.7 kpc .",
    "the mass errors are from the flux estimation , the assumed distance , and the adopted temperature . table  [ params ] shows the results for the five main subregions and for the entire cloud .",
    "column 1 gives the region name , columns 2 and 3 list the center coordinates , and column 4 is the nominal diameter of each subregion .",
    "the specified areas are used to calculate the total gas mass for each subregion .",
    "column 5 gives the peak velocity for each subregion and column 7 gives the @xmath7co  derived gas mass .",
    "one of the key projects undertaken with the _ herschel space observatory _  was the _ herschel _  infrared galactic plane survey , or hi - gal @xcite .",
    "hi - gal covers the galactic plane at 70 , 160 , 250 , 350 , and 500  from @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the advantage of using hi - gal millimeter wavelength dust continuum over @xmath7co  line emission to trace molecular gas is that carbon - based molecules deplete onto dust grains when densities exceed 10@xmath22 @xmath3 , while mm - continuum remains optically thin at the higher densities expected in irdcs and sf cores @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath7co  observations have the advantage of separating foreground and background emission to achieve a better estimate of total cloud mass , the sub - millimeter continuum should provide more accurate measurements in dense regions , such as irdcs and sf clumps .",
    "the hi - gal wavelength coverage spans the peak of thermal dust emission ( 15 k at @xmath23100 ) , which allows for temperature fitting and more accurate surface density estimates .",
    "we made a dust temperature map by first aligning and resampling the _ herschel _  maps to the 32 pixel scale of the 70 @xmath24 m maps using bi - linear interpolation .",
    "this approach has the advantage of perserving angular resolution and information in the short - wavelength maps but assumes that the emission at longer wavelengths varies smoothly over sub - pixel scales ( 14  pixel@xmath9 at 500 ) .",
    "we then made integrated velocity maps of associated @xmath7co  emission ( 3545 km  s@xmath9 ) and the total line - of - sight emission up to the tangent point velocity ( 079 km  s@xmath9 ) , and used the ratio of the two to determine the fraction of sub - mm emission associated with the sfr .",
    "this method makes the assumption that sub - millimeter emission scales linearly with @xmath7co  emission , which may not be the case over the wide density range observed .",
    "the density where @xmath7co  becomes optically thick and where it depletes onto dust grains will alter the ratio . as a result of these two effects , we may be underestimating the associated sub - mm flux , leading to lower masses and surface densities .",
    "this is only important in higher density regions , such as irdcs , and should not affect typical diffuse ism .    after subtracting possible contaminating foreground / background emission from the total in each band map",
    ", we used the idl fitting routine mpfit @xcite to fit the _ herschel _  5-band data , pixel - by - pixel , to a modified blackbody of the form : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the planck function , and @xmath28 is the optical depth at frequency @xmath29 . for the fitting we chose @xmath29",
    "= ( @xmath30/250  ) , @xmath31 = 1.75 , and left @xmath28 and @xmath32 as free parameters .",
    "we allow the temperature , @xmath32 , to range from 1 to 100 k and @xmath33 from 0 to 1 .",
    "we also required data in at least three bands at any given pixel for be fit .",
    "values for @xmath29 and @xmath31 were adopted from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure  [ temp ] shows a grayscale image of the derived temperature map .",
    "black contours outline 3 k steps from 1545 k , while green and magenta circles outline the different sub - regions as before .",
    "we derive average temperatures for off - cloud regions of 1922 k , which agrees well with typical galactic cirrus @xcite .",
    "fitted irdc temperatures generally range from 1422 k , and the bright rims of the bubbles have temperatures of 2545 k. computed average values for the subregions are listed in column 6 of table  [ params ] , these temperatures fit with the general picture that irdcs contain cold sf cores , while the bright - rimmed clouds are  region shells being heated by the winds and uv photons from massive stars .",
    "our procedures and results are similar to those from @xcite , except they use a variable @xmath31 .",
    "we performed a trial fit with @xmath31 variable from 0.52.5 , and the final temperatures were generally within 20% .",
    "the largest changes were in the irdcs where @xmath31 dropped to 0.61.0 and temperature increased from 15 k to 20 k. the bright rims were also fit to lower @xmath31 in the range of 1.5 , which increased the temperatures by 35 k. however , with at most 5 data photometric points , we deemed it necessary to reduce the number of free parameters and adopt a nominal fixed value for @xmath31 .    from the temperature map , we calculated the pixel - by - pixel total gas mass surface density with @xmath34 where i@xmath35 is the observed brightness at 500 @xmath24 m in mjy  sr@xmath9 , @xmath36 is the frequency - dependent opacity of 5.04 @xmath37  g@xmath9 , @xmath38 is the dust - to - gas ratio of 0.01 , and b@xmath35(t ) is the planck function in mjy  sr@xmath9 .",
    "the opacity was adopted from the tables of @xcite assuming thin ice mantles at a density of @xmath39  @xmath17 after @xmath6 yr .",
    "the surface densities are then multiplied by the area to arrive at a total gas mass , which for the irdc is 1386@xmath40418 @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite , using 1.2 mm continuum data from the iram 30 meter and a dust temperature of 15 k , derived a mass of 1792 @xmath1 , in rough agreement with our estimations from both @xmath7co  and 500  measurements .",
    "full results are listed in column 8 of table  [ params ] .",
    "we calculated the surface density for each of the five bands and found similar results for 170 , 250 , 350 , and 500 , but 70  varied significantly .",
    "we adopted the 500  values as this wavelength has the lowest optical depth and is likely to be the most reliable tracer of dense gas .",

    "white contours outline the 1.4 ghz radio continuum from vla galactic plane survey ( vgps ; @xcite ) .",
    "the minimum level is the mean background temperature plus two times the standard deviation , which is 13.15 k + 2(0.43 ) k = 14.01 k. subsequent contours are 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 and 12@xmath41 above the mean background temperature .",
    "the continuum images from the vgps have 1  resolution .",
    "the figure shows strong sub - mm emission from cold dust coincident with the irdcs and on the peripheries of the bubbles .",
    "the radio emission peaks inside the two bubbles n  74 and n  75 and exhibits a lesser peak near mcm  16 .",
    "fluxes were extracted for n  74 , n  75 , and mcm  16 using imview , but there was no detection for mcm  15 .",
    "considering , the weak emission from mcm  16 , it may be appropriate to treat the flux as an upper limit .",
    "the radio emission within the bubbles is most likely free - free emission from , so we estimate the number of ionizing photons necessary to produce the 1.4 ghz flux by : @xmath42 from @xcite , where f@xmath35 is the flux density in jy , @xmath43 is the frequency in ghz , d is the distance in kpc , and t@xmath44 is the electron temperature in 10@xmath22 k. we adopt 2.7 kpc for the distance , 8800 k for the electron temperature @xcite , and the frequency is of the vgps is 1.42 ghz .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ params ] , where column 9 is the measured flux , column 10 is the computed log@xmath45(n@xmath46 ) ph  s@xmath9 and column 11 is the o9.5v equivalent ( n@xmath46(o9.5v ) = 10@xmath47 ph  s@xmath9 ; @xcite ) . we find a uv flux of n@xmath48 = 10@xmath49 ph  s@xmath9 for n  74 , in agreement with the estimate of n@xmath48 = 10@xmath50 ph  s@xmath9 from @xcite . despite these values for the lyman continuum flux",
    ", it is still likely that the bubbles n  74 and n  75 each contain a late - o star ( see section  [ regionsec ] ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite investigated the o star content of three prominent bubbles ( n10 , n12 , and n49 from @xcite ) and found that the radio flux underestimated the ionizing flux by a factor of two when compared with estimates based on the known spectral type through optical spectroscopy .",
    "this is likely because a significant fraction of uv photons are being absorbed by dust and heating the grains , as evidenced by the bright 24  emission within ir bright bubbles .",
    "additional losses may be incurred if uv photons escape the bubbles without being absorbed ; therefore radio estimations of lyman continuum emission should be treated as lower limits . using a single o9.5v star as the estimated o star content of n  74 and n  75",
    ", we can calculate the mechanical wind luminosity , @xmath51 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mass - loss rate and @xmath54 is the wind velocity .",
    "this yields @xmath55 ergs  s@xmath9 for nominal values of @xmath56m@xmath57yr@xmath9 and 1500 km  s@xmath9  for the mass loss rate and wind velocity of an o9.5v star @xcite .",
    "we then calculate the  region expansion radius as a function of time from @xcite as , @xmath58 where @xmath51 is the wind luminosity in units of @xmath59 erg  s@xmath9 , @xmath60 is the ambient ism number density in 10@xmath61 @xmath3 , and t@xmath62 is the expansion time in myr .",

    "rdi forms stars in a few @xmath6 yr after the ionization front has reached the existing clumps and cc may take a few myr of  region expansion for sf to begin .",
    "the apparent youth of n  75 may rule out sf via cc or rdi , while n  74 may be old enough for either process to have formed stars , depending upon the intial conditions",
    "we identified ysos by fitting their observed near - ir ( nir ) and mid - ir ( mir ) spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to model seds .",
    "the procedure described below is similar to that of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the custom code calculated 24  fluxes and errors for the input source list using the location of glimpse psc detections and standard daophot - type routines .",
    "the relevant photometry parameters we adopted were an aperture of 7 , an annulus of 7  13 , an aperture correction of 2.05 , and a zero - point flux of 7.17 jy . if the extracted flux had a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) less than five , then an upper limit , defined as five times the flux error , was set instead .",
    "ukidss matches to glimpse sources were found by summing the astrometric errors ( 009 and 03 for ukidss and glimpse ) in quadrature , which yields a matching radius of 0313 .",

    "columns 13 and 14 are the average fractional stage ( f@xmath88 ) and dispersion in the acceptable fitted stages ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the stage classification is based off the criteria givein by @xcite .",
    "they assign stage 0/i ( hereafter , i ) for heavily embedded sources with an envelope accretion rate @xmath90  yr@xmath9 .",
    "stage ii ysos have @xmath91yr@xmath9 and @xmath92 .",
    "these objects have accreted most of their mass , but are young enough to still have a thick disk .",
    "thin disk , stage iii , ysos have only a moderate ir excess and are characterized by @xmath93  yr@xmath9 and @xmath94 .",
    "since yso evolution is a continuous process , we have calculated the average fractional stage ( f@xmath88 ) and uncertainty ( @xmath89 ) in addition to the integer stage . f@xmath88 and @xmath89 give a representation of which models fit the object and how well constrained they are . in some cases @xmath95 ; this does not imply a perfect fit .",
    "rather it means that all of the well - fit models for that object give the same stage .",
    "this typically occurs when there are a limited number of acceptable fits .",
    "we calculate the integer stage by requiring that at least two thirds of the total weight ( probability ) be matched with a single stage : @xmath96 so , if the combined weight of all stage i fits for a given object is greater than 0.67 , that object is classified as stage i. if no stage has a combined weight greater than 0.67 , then that object is classified as ambiguous . using this method , we find 54 stage i , 70 stage ii , 6 stage iii , and 32 ambiguous sources .",
    "figure  [ stages ] shows an example sed for each of the yso stages .",
    "the upper - left plot shows the sed for y133 ( stage i ) , the upper - right shows y112 ( stage ii ) , the lower - left shows y157 ( stage iii ) , and the lower - right shows an y30 ( ambiguous ) .",
    "the solid black curve is the full sed best - fit yso model , the grey curves other well - fit model seds with ( @xmath80)/n@xmath81 , and the long - dashed curve is the sed for the underlying star if there were no ir excess .",
    "there are a wide range of well - fit seds for the ambiguous sources , which explains the difficulty in obtaining a stage i or stage ii classification .",
    "the plots clearly show the importance of far - ir photometry in constraining yso stages .",
    "it is important to note that while the model sed fitter can give estimates of various yso physical parameters , the estimates become more uncertain as the number of data points and wavelength coverage decreases .",
    "@xcite showed that the sed fitter may significantly overestimate the mass of heavily embedded ysos with large envelopes , such as the stage i ysos present in the irdcs .",
    "it is also possible that there undetected multiple sources , so luminosities and mass may be overestimated in these cases .",
    "thus , the physical parameters given in table  [ ysoparams ] should be considered carefully .",
    "color - color and color - magnitude diagrams ( ccds and cmds ) are also useful for identifying and classifying ysos , and there are several different schemes employed @xcite .",

    "the arrows show an extinction of @xmath77  = 15 magnitudes @xcite the colors and magnitudes were chosen to provide the greatest separation between ysos and main - sequence ( ms ) stars and between different yso stages .",
    "the @xmath97 - [ 8.0]$ ] color shows excellent separation between ysos and the ms locus in both the cmd and ccd .",
    "the yso stages do not separate well , although the stage i objects are more red in @xmath98 - [ 4.5]$ ] than stage ii or ambiguous ysos .",
    "the @xmath98 - [ 4.5]$ ] versus @xmath99 - [ 24]$ ] ccd is much better at separating stage i ysos from stage ii ysos .",
    "it is interesting to note that in each of the four diagrams the ambiguous objects tend to fill the gaps in between stage i and stage ii ysos .",
    "this may indicate that they are in a transition phase between classical stage i and stage ii .",
    "this is also evident in the average properties in table  [ ysoparams ] .",

    "y36 has a weak [ 5.8 ] detection and y117 has a weak 8  detection , which is the likely cause of the blue color .",
    "y50 shows a broad dip in flux near 9 , which may be a result of self - absorption from viewing an edge - on disk @xcite .",
    "the fits to y130 show a more narrow dip in flux , which may be caused by silicates at 9.8  @xcite .",
    "there are several possible contaminants in any yso sample , the most common of which are asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite .",
    "agb stars represent an advanced stage in the evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars @xcite .",
    "they are also intrinsically cool and are prone to mass loss resulting in significant dust formation @xcite , and so they radiate strongly in the ir with yso - like near- and mid - ir colors @xcite .",

    "agb stars are also likely to outnumber ysos when considering sources with [ 4.5]@xmath100 8 @xcite ; only one yso is brighter than this threshold as the brightest sources typically presented seds that were removed earlier in the yso selection process .    in order to estimate possible contamination of our list by unassociated field ysos we performed the same analysis on a nearby , quiescent field region .",
    "it was a circular region equal in area to the target region with a radius of 123 centered on @xmath101 = 384490 and @xmath102 = -04548 . for g38.9",

    "the g38.9 - 0.4  region contains 176 contaminating sources ( not ms stars or ysos ) and the field region contains a similar number , 138 .",
    "the 28%  difference is most likely due to natural variation in the field star density , but a fraction of the extra sources might be ysos that were removed due to weak ir excess or unreliable photometry .",
    "the ratio of field ysos to sfr ysos is quite small , 5% , so we can assume that most of the ysos in tables  [ ysocolors ] and [ ysoparams ] are associated with the sfr itself .",
    "we also find that there are no agb stars in the field as identified in the @xcite catalog while there was just one in the sfr , so we also conclude that the agb contamination towards g38.9 - 0.4  is small . @xcite estimate @xmath103 contamination in their yso list for m17 , however , our region is covers a much smaller area , is further from the galactic center ( @xmath104 for m17 ) , and likely has a less complicated line of sight .",
    "therefore , we may expect to have a lower contamination fraction .",

    "the ysos tend to cluster near the irdcs , with several stage i sources surrounding mcm  15 .",

    "it is possible that ysos have not yet , or will not be , formed in the bubbles shells , or they are simply hidden amid the high ir background .      the final yso count , 54 stage i , 70 stage ii , 6 stage iii , and 32 ambiguous , is quite different than those in other known sfrs",
    ". the observed ratio of stage i ysos to stage ii of 0.76 is quite high compared with other reported values of 0.55 , 0.4 , 0.38 , and 0.01 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; respectively ) .",
    "each of the regions studied are very different in terms of morphology , sky coverage , and yso identification methods , which may be responsible for some of the differences .",
    "it is also possible that this represents a possible age difference with higher stage i / ii ratios representing younger regions .",
    "@xcite studied m17 and @xcite studied the w5  region , both of which have distances of @xmath106 kpc , while the main clusters have ages of 3 myr ( m17 ) and 5 myr ( w5 ) based on the maximum ages of the most massive stars .",
    "these ages , and the 12 myr ages for n  74 and 75 , are significantly longer than the average lifetime of stage i ysos ( 0.10.2 myr ; @xcite ) . both m17 and w5 show evidence for multiple epochs of sf @xcite , where the initial populations may have evolved beyond the embedded stage i phase lowering the overall stage i / ii ratio . however , the g38.9 - 0.4  sfr may still be in the first generation of sf and thus have a younger yso population .",
    "the large fraction of ysos coincident with irdcs , which are sites of current sf , is also suggestive of young stars .",
    "the lack of stage iii objects , and stage ii to some extent , may be explained by the difficulties in detecting weak ir excesses , especially in regions of high and variable extinction .",
    "a stage iii yso sed may show little - to - no excess and appear stellar shortward of 10 , and these may be removed by the initial stellar sed fitting .",
    "stage ii ysos can show excesses at shorter wavelengths , but extinction may hinder their detection .",
    "the location of g38.9 - 0.4  in the heart of the galactic plane makes it difficult to assess the associated stellar content , in part because of extinction that is high and highly variable .",
    "also , field stars likely outnumber associated ms and pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars and must be removed in order to recover likely cluster stars . in order to look for stellar clusters we follow the prescription of @xcite to evaluate and remove the field star contamination .",
    "the field star estimation tool compares a target region to a field region using a ukidss @xmath107 3-dimensional color - color - magnitude diagrams ( ccmd ) . after investigating different color and magnitude combinations",
    ", we used the @xmath108 and @xmath109 magnitudes , as in @xcite .",
    "ccmds were constructed for both the target regions containing a putative cluster ( about 10  radius for mcm  15 , mcm  16 , n  75 , and n  74 ) and a field annulus around the target center . we made the annulus as large as possible without overlapping a neighboring bubble , 12  for the outer radius . since the target and field areas are , in general , not equal , the number of field stars is normalized by the target - to - field area ratio , a.    to estimate the field star content , the ccmd is divided to 3d bins along the magnitude and color directions .",
    "the cluster membership probability is then determined by the ratio of stars in the target bin stars to those in the field bin , @xmath110 .",
    "so , if there are five stars in the target bin and one star in the field bin , then one star in the target bin is a  field star \" and the membership probability for each target star is 0.8 . in cases",
    "where the number of field stars in a cell is equal or greater than the number of target stars in the same ccmd cell , membership probabilities are zero .",
    "in order to mitigate sensitivity to the choice of bin center and bin size , we used three different cell sizes for each color and magnitude .",
    "bin widths were 0.15 , 0.30 , and 0.45 mag for @xmath111 and @xmath109 , and 0.5 , 0.75 , and 1.0 mag for @xmath73 .",

    "@xcite find a wide range of slopes between 1.4 and 3.8 for eight nearby sf regions , but they did not calculate slopes for distinct evolutionary stages .",
    "they also adopt an average mass for their ysos of 0.5 @xmath1 , while we use the average individual mass from the model yso fits .",
    "we also use the sixth nearest neighbors , while @xcite use up to the 11th .",
    "if the nearest neighbor count was increased from 6 to 11 , then the resulting slopes all drop by about 11% , meaning that our results are relatively insensitive to the choice of n. another difference is that the regions in studied in @xcite have distances less than 1 kpc and thus have a greater ability to detect low - mass ysos",
    ". figure  [ ymf ] shows a clear drop in yso counts below 2 @xmath1 , which may have significant effects on the slope of the yso - gas density relation .",
    "if undetected ysos have a similar spatial distribution to the current yso list , then the slope of the density relation would remain the same but with a larger y - intercept .",
    "however , it is possible that faint ( i.e. , low - mass ) ysos are preferentially detected in areas with lower extinction and lower sky background .",
    "if this is true , then a higher fraction of low - mass ysos may remain undetected in high gas surface density regions .",
    "this type of detection bias could steepen the slope shown in figure  [ surf ] and bring the values more in line with those from @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the schmidt - kennicutt law @xcite , which describes the power - law relation between the areal sf rate density and the mass surface density has a power law index of 1.4 similar to the ysos in this region .      in the introduction , we described the basic mechanism for three theoretically defined triggered sf scenarios : cc , rdi , and rr .",
    "another mode of triggered sf involves the sequential collapse of material along a molecular filament .",
    "simulations by @xcite show that as an  region expands in a filament , it will cause the cloud to  pinch \" and trigger the collapse of new sf cores to either side of the original  region .",
    "if these new cores eventually form their own  regions , the process will repeat .",
    "recent evidence has shown that sf molecular clouds tend to be filamentary in nature @xcite , and observational studies have suggested that  filament pinching \" might trigger sequential waves of sf @xcite and work by @xcite hints at a similar sequential sf scenario . in regions with clear ms populations and known massive stars , they argue that the distribution of ysos mirrors the pre - sf filamentary structure of the parent molecular clouds . they also suggest that massive stars and  regions enhance sf by compressing the filaments .    the glimpse 8  and _ herschel _  500  images ( figure  [ radio ] ) show that the spaces between the bubbles have dark lanes .",
    "this may indicate a swept - up shell , or , it may instead be evidence of a pre - existing filament that extended from north of mcm  15 through the bubbles and further south . in this model one of the bubbles",
    "could have been the initial  region , which triggered the sequential collapse of the cloud . however , the estimated bubble ages are similar and it is not clear whether one would have had sufficient time to trigger the other . it may be that the bubbles formed within the same cloud but do not have a causal relationship .    in a large statistical study , @xcite",
    "cross - matched the location of massive yso ( myso ) candidates @xcite with ir bubbles @xcite and found that 22%  of mysos are coincident with bubble rims .",
    "@xcite used the more complete bubble catalog from the milky way project @xcite and found a similar coincidence within the bubbles .",
    "they also found that 67%  of mysos lie within 2 bubble radii .",
    "these data suggest that triggered sf occurs in the presence of bubbles and  regions . however , many bubbles are likely to reside in or near large sfrs and molecular cloud complexes . as such , bubbles are not unbiased regions distributed at random , but rather they are likely biased toward higher - than - average column density regions where stars are already expected to be forming .",
    "figure  [ ysofig ] shows that most of the ysos may be associated with the irdcs surrounding n  74 and n  75 rather than with the bubbles , even at distances exceeding one bubble radius .",
    "most of the ysos that lie between one and two bubble radii away from n  74 and n  75 are most likely associated with nearby irdcs or other features and the bubbles .",
    "therefore , extending the triggered region beyond one bubble radius increases the likelihood of including spurious ysos that are not causally connected to the bubbles .    one method of demonstrating the occurrence of triggered sf is to establish a radial yso stage gradient as a proxy for age .",
    "the n  74 bubble has two stage i ysos within it compared to six stage ii ysos , while the rim is a mixture of stage i , ii , and ambiguous ysos .",
    "the bubble interior then has a stage i / ii ratio of 0.2 compared to the 0.75 stage i / ii ratio seen over the entirety of g38.9 - 0.4 .",
    "this may be suggestive of an age gradient , but the limited number of ysos around the n  74 and n  75 prohibit a statistically significant determination .",
    "we also see a dip in gas surface density ( figure  [ radio ] ) coincident with the bubble centers and a density enhancement on the periphery , which is suggestive of a swept up shell .",
    "however , the portion of the n  74 rim that shows the largest number of ysos also abuts the irdc , and the ysos may have formed from the irdc prior to the advancement of the  region .",
    "we conclude that there is no definitive evidence for an age gradient in the n  74/n  75 bubbles .",
    "triggered sf via rdi and rr is characterized by a relatively short timescale ( @xmath126 myr ) and the presence of ysos with trailing , wind - blown pillars pointed towards the exciting source(s ) .",
    "there appear to be no such structures within the entire region .",
    "it is possible that the flux of ionizing lyman continuum radiation is not high enough to effectively compress the surrounding ism to form stars or that not enough time has passed for ysos to have formed through rdi .",
    "however , at the estimated bubble age of 1 myr , rdi triggered ysos should have had enough time to form .",
    "we conclude there is no evidence that rdi plays an important role in this sfr .    triggering",
    "via cc predicts that sf will occur in massive , regularly spaced clumps over myr timescales and that the subsequent generation will include massive stars @xcite .",
    "n  74 and n  75 appear to be wind - blown bubbles and the _ herschel _ sub - mm and gas surface density maps indicate that they have been at least partially evacuated , as would be seen in a cc triggered sf scenario .",
    "however , there is no evidence for current sf within the bubble rims , and only a handful of ysos have been detected within the bubbles , none of them massive .",
    "also , while the gas surface density does drop within the bubbles it is not obvious that gas condensations have formed as a result of stellar feedback .",
    "the highest gas surface densities detected near the bubble peripheries ( 0.05 g  @xmath17at the upper left corner of n  75 as seen in figure  [ rgb ] ) occur in the same azimuthal direction as the irdcs that lie just outside the bubbles .",
    "the projection of the irdcs and bubble rims makes it difficult to determine whether the gas is swept - up material from the bubble interior or the ambient molecular gas comprising the irdcs , or both .",
    "we suspect that the majority of the gas is related to the irdcs because surface density contours match the outline of the irdcs visible in the glimpse 8  maps . for n  74 and n  75",
    ", we conclude that there is no compelling evidence to invoke triggered sf through cc on bubble rims as a result of the stellar feedback .",
    "if feedback enhances sf through triggering , one possible observable consequence is a higher star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , i.e. , a higher density of ysos per unit gas mass in triggered sfrs than in non - triggered regions .",
    "that is , triggering may elevate the sfe by precipitating collapse of clouds that are marginally stable and otherwise would not have formed stars .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that stellar feedback may both trigger and suppress sf simultaneously and not have a strong effect on the overall sfe @xcite .",
    "our analysis is consistent with a scenario whereby stellar feedback does not have an appreciable net effect on the total sfe of a molecular cloud .",
    "figure  [ surf ] does not show any significant difference in the density of ysos on the rims or within bubbles ( blue symbols ) compared to those not obviously influenced by massive star feedback ( black symbols ; regions outside the bubbles ) .",
    "_ although the statistical power in this sample is limited , this null result may be taken to mean that triggering either has not occurred , or that feedback does not affect the sfe and is not as significant a factor as the initial molecular cloud density .",
    "_ this conclusion is in agreement with others who have suggested that triggering does not measurably affect the global sf rate @xcite .",
    "stellar feedback - induced triggering may be just one of many mechanisms to form stars among processes such as the isolated spontaneous collapse of molecular cores , sf driven by cloud - cloud collisions , or other dynamical effects .",
    "in essence , sf within a cloud does not depend on how the molecular gas reaches the critical density , only that the density is reached before the sf clumps are disrupted by outside forces @xcite .",
    "our analysis of sfr within g38.9 - 0.4  appears consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "we have performed a multiwavelength analysis on the g38.9 - 0.4  sfr , which lies along a relatively unconfused line of sight at a distance of 2.7 kpc .",
    "the complex hosts a series of ir - bright bubbles , a web of irdcs , and a large molecular cloud .    1 .   the maximum gas mass surface density within the region is 0.2 g  @xmath17 .",
    "this suggests that current sf will is limited to low- and intermediate - mass stars , consistent with observations of the ysos .",
    "2 .   the n  74 and n  75 bubbles are each powered by a single o9.5v star surrounded by a compact cluster .",
    "there is a similar cluster in mcm  16 , but likely anchored by an early - b star .",
    "we detect a total of 162 ysos with 54 stage i , 70 stage ii , 6 stage iii , and 32 ambiguous classifications .",
    "the high ratio of stage i to stage ii ysos ( 0.76 ) is consistent with the idea that sf in this region has only recently begun .",
    "the calculated yso mass function slope @xmath127 is significantly steeper than salpeter but consistent with other ymf studies .",
    "we find only a weak correlation between individual yso mass and the local gas mass surface density .",
    ".   there is , however , a strong correlation between areal yso mass surface density and gas mass surface density with a tight power - law slope of 1.3 .",
    "classical signposts of triggering ( pillars , ysos coincident with bubble rims & shells , yso age gradients within bubbles ) appear to be absent in this region .",
    "we conclude that , at present , traditional mechanisms ( cc , rdi ) proposed as triggers for sf have likely not occurred",
    ". this may be the case because either the single o9.5v stars provide insufficient mechanical / luminous energy to initiate triggering , or because the bubbles are too young for triggering to have begun , but we can not discriminate between these possibilities at present .",
    "we used the bubbles to divide g38.9 - 0.4  into possible causal ( triggered ) and non - causal ( non - triggered ) regions to investigate the sf properties separately .",
    "we find no evidence to suggest that stellar feedback has enhanced or supressed the local sfe within the bubbles relative to other regions of the molecular cloud .",
    "this suggests that the sf rate and sfe are sensitive mainly to the gas density , regardless how the gas is collected .",
    "detailed studies of the molecular gas around a larger sample of  regions should be able to quantify the importance of feedback - triggered sf by determining the fraction of high - density , feedback - compressed gas surrounding  regions relative to that already present in quiescent molecular clouds .",
    "such studies would yield a quantitative measure of the fraction of all sf possibly influenced by stellar feedback .",

    "<S> we present a study of the star formation ( sf ) region g38.9 - 0.4 using publicly available multiwavelength galactic plane surveys from ground- and space - based observatories . </S>",

    "<S> n  74 and n  75 , each host a star cluster anchored by a single o9.5v star . we identified 162 young stellar objects ( ysos ) and classify 54 as stage i , 7 stage ii , 6 stage iii , and 32 ambiguous . we do not detect the classical signposts of triggered sf , i.e. , star - forming pillars or ysos embedded within bubble rims . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that feedback - triggered sf has not occurred in g38.9 - 0.4 . </S>",
    "<S> the ysos are preferentially coincident with infrared dark clouds . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a strong correlation between areal yso mass surface density and gas mass surface density with a power law slope near 1.3 , which closely matches the schmidt - kennicutt law . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation is similar inside and outside the bubbles and may mean that the sf efficiency is neither enhanced nor supressed in regions potentially influenced by stellar feedback . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that gas density , regardless of how it is collected , is a more important driver of sf than stellar feedback . </S>",
    "<S> larger studies should be able to quantify the fraction of all sf that is feedback - triggered by determining the fraction sf , feedback - compressed gas surrounding regions relative to that already present in molecular clouds . </S>"
