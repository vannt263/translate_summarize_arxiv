    "let us discuss some motivations to study ( [ linear_problem ] ) . in this regard , it is perhaps worthwhile to start noticing that , from a pde perspective , problem ( [ linear_problem ] ) is very natural . without the normal derivative @xmath7 on the second term on the left - hand side of ( [ eq_f_bry_estimates ] ) ,",
    "the problem decouples : ( [ eq_f_bry_estimates])-([ic_f_bry_estimates ] ) becomes a wave equation on the boundary , which can be solved by standard techniques , and equation ( [ harmonic_ext_linear ] ) says that this solution on @xmath1 is extended to the interior via the unique harmonic extension of @xmath20 .",
    "a similar procedure is no longer possible when the term @xmath7 is present , as in ( [ linear_problem ] ) .",
    "the introduction of the normal derivative can be viewed as one of the simplest ways of modifying the wave equation on the boundary as to make it dependent on the interior values of @xmath21 .    a more direct motivation to investigate ( [ linear_problem ] ) is that it arises at the linearized level in the study of the ( incompressible ) free boundary euler equations , as we now explain .",
    "consider the motion of an inviscid incompressible fluid within a bounded region of space , and suppose further that the boundary of the region confining the fluid is not rigid , being allowed to move according to the pressure exerted by the fluid ( hence the name  free bounary \" ) .",
    "this is the situation , for example , in a liquid drop , or in newtonian self - gravitating fluid bodies , such as stars @xcite ( the analogue problem for viscous fluids was first and extensively studied by solonnikov @xcite , with some more recent advances found in @xcite and references therein ) . in such situations ,",
    "the domain containing the fluid changes over time .",
    "one thus writes @xmath22 , and @xmath22 becomes one of the unknowns of the problem .",
    "the equations of motion describing the situation of the previous paragraph are the well - known free boundary euler equations : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fluid velocity , @xmath25 is the fluid pressure , @xmath26 is the mean curvature of @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the unit outer normal to @xmath27 , @xmath29 is the velocity of the moving boundary @xmath27 , and @xmath8 a non - negative constant known as coefficient of surface tension .",
    "we refer the reader to the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) for a detailed discussion of these equations .",
    "it is important to point out that , despite its importance and the great deal of work dedicated to ( [ free_euler ] ) @xcite , only recently the problem has been shown to be well - posed @xcite ( other recent results , including the study of the compressible free boundary euler equations , are @xcite ) .",
    "a very natural question is that of the behavior of solutions to ( [ free_euler ] ) in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "physically , large values of @xmath8 correspond to domains with longer relaxation times or , more colloquially , to stiffer domains .",
    "therefore , one would expect that solutions ( [ free_euler ] ) with large @xmath8 should be near solutions of the standard euler equations in the _ fixed _ domain @xmath31 .",
    "the study of the limit @xmath30 , along with a proof of the corresponding convergence , was carried out by the author and david g. ebin in @xcite in the case of two - spatial dimensions ( the reader is also referred to @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the intuition behind this convergence ) .",
    "the core of the analysis consists in studying the problem from the point of view of lagrangian coordinates , in which case all quantities can be written as time - dependent functions on the fixed domain @xmath0 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the flow of the vector field @xmath24 , @xmath33 , is decomposed in a part fixing the boundary and a boundary motion .",
    "such decomposition takes the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a diffeomorphism of the domain @xmath0 ( so in particular @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the identity diffeomorphism .",
    "the term @xmath39 controls the motion of the boundary , and using ( [ free_euler ] ) , it is possible to derive an equation for @xmath21 .",
    "_ at the linearized level and to highest order , this equation is _ ( [ linear_problem ] ) ; the third order operator @xmath40 stems from the mean curvature of the moving boundary .",
    "see @xcite for details .    in @xcite ,",
    "we were interested in studying the limit @xmath30 , and therefore we relied on the aforementioned existence results for ( [ free_euler ] ) ( particularly , @xcite ) . therefore , the existence of solutions for the linearized problem , namely , ( [ linear_problem ] ) , has not been addressed in @xcite . while it will be shown in a future work that the decomposition ( [ decomp ] ) can be employed to derive existence of solutions to ( [ free_euler ] ) @xcite , such an analysis is based on the calculus of pseudo - differential operators and techniques similar to @xcite .",
    "hence , the simpler , more traditional methods that we shall present here do not appear elsewhere .",
    "furthermore , the results in @xcite do not cover the case of _ weak _ solutions to ( [ linear_problem ] ) , which is the main point of this paper ( see definition [ defi_weak ] ) .",
    "we point out that the singular limit @xmath30 investigated in @xcite fits into the larger picture of properties of solutions viewed as curves on infinite dimensional manifolds of mappings , which has been extensively studied in the context of the euler equations .",
    "see the references @xcite , and the discussion in the introduction of @xcite .",
    "while here we shall not study the dependence on the parameter @xmath8 , it is instructive to keep the above ideas in mind . in this regard ,",
    "compare ( [ linear_problem ] ) with the toy - model presented in @xcite .    naturally , dynamic boundary value problems have a long history , leading to variants of ( [ linear_problem ] ) . adding to the aforementioned works , whose focus is mainly on equations of hyperbolic type ,",
    "the reader can consult , for instance , @xcite and references therein , for a point of view that stresses parabolic equations .",
    "equations involving two time derivatives and a third order operator also have been studied before ( see , for instance , @xcite , and references therein , and see also the related @xcite ) . in particular , due to the elliptic operator @xmath5 , the boundary equation ( [ eq_f_bry_estimates ] ) is reminiscent of the so - called wentzell boundary conditions , which have been widely studied by a. favini , g. goldstein , j. goldstein , and s. romanelli ( a sample of such works is @xcite ) .    in order to state our results ,",
    "some notation and definitions are needed .",

    "notice that @xmath48 the intersections forming @xmath49 are of sobolev spaces that differ by @xmath50 derivatives .",
    "this is because equation ( [ eq_f_bry_estimates ] ) is second order in time and third order in space , thus each time derivative corresponds to @xmath50 spatial derivatives .",
    "the spaces @xmath51 are similarly defined , and the norm in @xmath52 is denoted @xmath53 .",
    "as it is implied in the above definitions , we are working with sobolev spaces defined with @xmath54 . in the case",

    ", @xmath64 is simply the @xmath65 space .    as ( [ linear_problem ] )",
    "has not appeared in the literature before , our main interest is to define a natural notion of weak solutions to problem ( [ linear_problem ] ) , and then show that these solutions exist . with this in mind , our treatment will focus on the simple situation where @xmath0 is the unit ball , and we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath66 . in this situation , problem ( [ linear_problem ] ) simplifies considerably , although many of the arguments below can be extended to a more general setting .",
    "furthermore , this covers one of the main cases of interest , namely , that motivated by the linearization of ( [ free_euler ] ) as discussed above and studied in @xcite .",
    "we now proceed to state our results",
    ".    denote @xmath67 \\times \\partial { \\omega})$ ] .",
    "define a map @xmath68 where @xmath69 is computed using the harmonic extension of @xmath21 to @xmath0 , and we write @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath72 be the image of @xmath73 .",
    "we shall prove the following .",
    "let @xmath74 be the ball of radius one centered at the origin , and fix some @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath73 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 be as above . then : + ( i ) @xmath73 is injective , and since @xmath77 , @xmath78 defines a map @xmath79 the map @xmath78 is continuous as a map from @xmath75 to @xmath80 .",

    "[ prop_extension ]    we can now introduce the following .    let @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 be given .",
    "we say that @xmath88 is a weak solution of ( [ linear_problem ] ) , if @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the map given by proposition [ prop_extension ] , and @xmath21 satisfies ( [ harmonic_ext_linear ] ) in @xmath0 .",
    "[ defi_weak ]    to understand why this is a suitable definition of weak solutions for problem ( [ linear_problem ] ) , one should think of the example of the wave equation . in that case ,",
    "given initial data in @xmath91 and an inhomogeneous term in , say , @xmath92 , h^{0}({\\mathbb r}^n))$ ] , the weak solution @xmath24 is in @xmath93,h^1({\\mathbb r}^n ) ) \\cap c^1([0,t ] , h^{0}({\\mathbb r}^n))$ ] .",
    "thus , the weak solution has one less spatial derivative than the order of the equation , with @xmath94 one degree less differentiable in space than @xmath24 itself .",
    "such a regularity is a consequence of the energy estimate , in which an integration by parts is performed . in our case , each time derivative corresponds to @xmath50 spatial ones , and we heuristically think of integrating by parts half of the derivatives of the third order spatial term",
    ".    proposition [ prop_extension ] essentially contains the existence of weak solutions , but we state it separately for convenience .",
    "let @xmath74 be the ball of radius one centered at the origin , and fix some @xmath10 .",
    "given @xmath87 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , there exists a unique weak solution to the problem ( [ linear_problem ] ) .",
    "[ main_theorem ]    it should be stressed that for sufficiently regular data , existence for ( [ linear_problem ] ) can probably be derived by other means .",
    "the novelty of theorem [ main_theorem ] is centered around the notion of weak solutions and their existence . in this regard , it is important to stress that a semi - group approach can also be employed to study ( [ linear_problem ] ) , in which case one is led , via stone s theorem , to investigate the existence of mild - solutions to the problem @xcite .",
    "such mild solutions are , in fact , closely related to our notion of weak solution .",
    "we believe , however , that the energy - method approach here employed is significantly simpler in the sense that it does not rely on heavy functional - analytic techniques , and is also of independent interest to the community more acquainted with such type of estimates .",
    "in this section we carry out the necessary energy estimates for the proofs of proposition [ prop_extension ] and theorem [ main_theorem ] .",
    "we start recalling some useful tools and fixing some of the notation .      here , we collect some well known facts that will be used in the paper .",
    "their proofs can be found in many sources , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "first , recall that restriction to the boundary gives rise to a bounded linear map , @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",

    "we shall reserve @xmath102 for other purposes below , thus we use @xmath99 in ( [ cauchy_epsilon ] ) to avoid confusion ) .      here , we make some remarks about coordinates and notation .    recalling that @xmath0 is the ball of radius one centered at the origin , we write @xmath103 sometimes , we employ spherical coordinates @xmath104 , so that @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the laplacian on the standard round sphere , given in these coordinates by @xmath107 in particular , the laplacian on @xmath108 , which we denote @xmath5 for any @xmath109 , is @xmath110 we shall use @xmath5 as an operator on the whole of @xmath0 . to be precise , this is not defined at zero , but the origin can be removed without changing the value of the integrals @xmath111 containing @xmath5 that will appear below . in particular",
