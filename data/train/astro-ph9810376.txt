    "current thinking considers two major pathways to the formation of spiral bulges .",
    "simplistically , either the bulge formed before the disk ( `` bulge - first , '' e.g. van den bosch 1998 ) , or formed _ from _ the disk ( `` disk - first , '' e.g. , combes & sanders 1981 ) .",
    "previous studies have shown that bulges of big - bulge spirals ( like m31 ) share at least some stellar population properties with mid - sized elliptical galaxies .",
    "they fall along the @xmath0@xmath1 relation ( dressler 1987 ) and the fundamental plane ( bender , burstein & faber 1992 ) . moreover , jablonka et al .  ( 1996 ) and idiart et al .  (",
    "1996 ) find that bulges of spirals ( as late as sc ) fall along the mg@xmath1 relation defined by early - type galaxies , suggesting that bulges share a mass - metallicity relation with elliptical galaxies .",
    "together with kinematical evidence , these observations have led to the idea that mid - sized ellipticals accrete disks from some leftover gas reservoir , forming spiral galaxies ( see , e.g. , kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , the stars in spiral galaxy bulges should be similar to the stars in ellipticals ( i.e.  metal - rich , high [ mg / fe ] ; e.g. , worthey , faber & gonzlez 1992 ; trager et al.1998b ) and unlike the stars in spiral galaxy disks .",
    "kinematical and surface brightness observations of small - bulge spirals indicate that their bulges share many properties with their disks : many bulges in these spirals are better represented by a shallower exponential profile than by the steep de vaucouleurs profile ( e.g. , de jong 1996 ) and many of these bulges exhibit disk - like kinematics ( see kormendy 1993 for an excellent review ) .",
    "moreover , peletier & balcells ( 1996 ) and de jong ( 1996 ) find that the color difference between bulge and disk in an individual galaxy is much smaller than the variation in colors across galaxies of a single hubble type .",
    "these observations have led these authors and others to propose that bulges ( of small - bulge spirals at least ) are formed from the stars already present in their underlying disks .",
    "that is , the stars in spiral galaxy bulges should be similar to the stars in spiral galaxy disks ( e.g. , ages and metallicities of their inner disks , solar [ mg / fe ] ) and unlike stars in ellipticals .",
    "these two scenarios do have testable consequences , and sophisticated techniques now available can provide definitive answers to these questions .",
    "we have embarked on a multi - year survey to probe the stellar content of the bulges and inner disks of spirals using absorption - line strengths .",
    "these measurements can provide the critical tests needed to understand the basic mechanisms driving bulge formation .",
    "we have selected a sample of 91 southern face - on spirals , ranging in type from s0/a to sdm , barred and unbarred , from the eso ( b ) survey .",
    "these spirals are not interacting , have major axes larger than 3 , are within 4000 @xmath2 and are located at @xmath3 .",
    "the observations have been made using the long - slit boller & chivens spectrograph at las campanas observatory in the blue , giving @xmath4   ( @xmath5 ) resolution in the 40005200   region .",
    "this spectral range covers portions of both the lick / ids ( burstein et al .",
    "1984 ; worthey et al .",
    "1994 ; trager et al .",
    "1998a ) and rose ( 1985 , 1994 ) absorption - line strength systems . to date , ten ( primarily unbarred ) spirals have been observed , most along both major and minor axes , and data from four have been processed .",
    "line - strength profiles for these four galaxies have been calibrated onto the lick / ids system using stellar observations in common with jones ( 1996 ) , and velocity dispersion profiles and rotation curves have been derived following the fourier - quotient procedure described by gonzlez ( 1993 ) .      as described above",
    ", bulge - first formation mechanisms find support in the observation that bulges in galaxies as late as sc fall along the same mg@xmath6@xmath7 relation as early - type galaxies ( jablonka et al .",
    "1996 ; idiart et al .",
    "1996 ) , suggesting the existence of a mass - metallicity relation in spirals and a narrow spread in ages at fixed @xmath7 .",
    "we confirm these observational results : our bulges fall on the mg@xmath8@xmath7 relation defined by early - type galaxies ( our observations do not cover the red sideband of the broad mg@xmath6 index ; see data in trager et al .",
    "however , the mg@xmath1 relation is inherently _ degenerate to compensating variations in metallicity and age in old stellar populations_large age spreads can exist if there is a complementary age - metallicity relation ( worthey , trager & faber 1996 ; trager 1997 ) .",
    "this intrinsic age - metallicity degeneracy in mg@xmath8 and mg@xmath6 ( and other metal lines and broadband colors ) prevents the mg@xmath1 relation from being an effective stellar population age discriminator .",
    "more sophisticated techniques are obviously necessary to distinguish between bulge formation mechanisms .",
    "there is a way to break the age - metallicity degeneracy ",
    "balmer lines are more age - sensitive than metal - line indices ( with the possible exception of the g band ; worthey 1994 ) . in the absence of of nebular emission or large numbers of blue horizontal branch stars or",
    "blue stragglers , balmer - line strengths reflect light - weighted mean turnoff temperature of the composite stellar population  i.e . , the mean age of the population .",
    "balmer lines do have some intrinsic metal dependence , however , so a clean separation of age and metallicity effects requires diagnostic diagrams combining balmer line and metal line strengths .",
    "figure  [ bmd ] presents such diagrams for the first four galaxies analyzed in our sample .    the balmer  metal - line diagrams for large bulges ( sab  sbc , @xmath9 ) suggest that the bulges of these early - type spirals are consistent with having old , metal - rich stellar populations , as seen in our own galaxy ( @xmath10 gyr , @xmath11}\\gtrsim0 $ ] ; e.g. , mcwilliam & rich 1994 ; bruzual et al .",
    "these bulges are also older than their inner disks by several gyr , suggesting that these bulges formed early on in the galaxies histories , and that bulge - first formation is a likely scenario for these galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , small bulges ( sc , @xmath12 ) seem to have younger and more metal - poor populations ( @xmath13 gyr , @xmath14}\\lesssim0 $ ] ) , and at least in some galaxies ( ngc 1637 ) , the bulge and inner disk are roughly the same age .",
    "such an observation provides strong support for a common origin of bulge and disk material  that is , for a disk - first formation scenario",
    ". however , contamination from emission is difficult to remove , separation of bulge and disk light has not yet been attempted , and small amounts of young or intermediate - age populations can significantly increase balmer - line strengths ( trager et al .",
    "in these late - type , star - forming , small - bulged galaxies , such effects may obscure truly old bulge populations .",
    "( 100,200)(50,30 ) ( 0,0 )",
    "the initial indications are that large bulges are genuinely old , metal - rich systems , as expected from our own galactic bulge .",
    "the stellar populations of small bulges appear to be younger and more metal - poor than the large bulges , but contamination from emission lines and disk light make these conclusions uncertain for the moment . if these results stand with more data and more extended analysis , we may find that bulges may have more than one formation mechanism  or even more than one mechanism may occur in a single galaxy ( rix , this meeting ) .",
