    "the successful isolation of flakes of the two - dimensional crystal graphene and the measured high thermal and carrier mobility open new possibilities for application in nanoelectronics@xcite and nanophotonics.@xcite it is important to investigate the state of strain in graphene , because strain can effectively modify the electronic structure and phonon dispersion,@xcite and thus change the transport properties of this material .@xcite this can be done easily and in a non - destructive way by means of raman spectroscopy.@xcite    the raman spectrum of perfect graphene is dominated by an intense first - order raman band , the so - called g band , and a few second - order raman bands.@xcite the most intense one among the latter is observed at @xmath7 @xmath8 and is termed the 2d band .",
    "this band is dispersive , i.e. , it depends on the laser photon energy @xmath9 .",
    "it is excited by double - resonant scattering processes,@xcite favored by the specific cone - like electronic structure near the fermi energy .",
    "raman measurements on strained graphene have been performed at different strain magnitude , strain direction , and laser photon energy.@xcite in all these studies , only one or two peaks of the 2d band could be resolved and their shift rates have been derived . in two similar measurements,@xcite the determined strains differ by a factor of @xmath10 , which shows that the calibration of strain can still be an issue .",
    "the dependence of the shift rate on strain can be obtained by calculation of the 2d band under various strain conditions .",
    "the complexity of these calculations at the _ ab - initio _ level hinders the detailed investigation of the dependence of this band on strain and laser photon energy .",
    "the theoretical work has so far been limited to the calculation of the 2d peak position,@xcite while the intensity of the peaks is either treated approximately,@xcite or , in a limited number of cases , is calculated from first principles.@xcite despite the success in modeling the 2d raman band of graphene , a detailed investigation of its behavior under strain is mandatory for monitoring strain in this material by means of raman spectroscopy .",
    "recently , we have reported the predicted 2d band of graphene at strain magnitude @xmath11 and @xmath12 ev within a non - orthogonal tight - binding ( ntb ) model.@xcite the very good agreement of our results with the available experimental data supports the applicability of this model to the 2d band of strained graphene .    here , we use the ntb model for large - scale calculations of the 2d band in graphene under uniaxial strain in the range of the accessible strain magnitudes and distinct strain directions , as well as for the common laser photon energies .",
    "the ntb model is presented in sec .",
    "the obtained results are discussed in comparison with available experimental data in sec .",
    "the paper ends up with conclusions ( sec .",
    "the ntb model@xcite uses hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements obtained from an _ ab - initio _ study.@xcite this model has no adjustable parameters , which is an advantage over the majority of tight - binding models .",
    "it also allows one to determine the total energy and forces on atoms .",
    "this feature is necessary for the relaxation of the atomic structure of graphene and for the calculation of the phonon dispersion .",
    "the latter is performed using a perturbative approach within the ntb model with electron - phonon matrix elements derived within the same model.@xcite the structure relaxation and phonon dispersion calculations require the summation over the brillouin zone of graphene .",
    "the phonon frequencies converge to within 1 @xmath8 on increasing the size of the monkhorst - pack mesh of points up to @xmath13 .",
    "the calculated high - frequency phonon branches are overestimated by the ntb model .",
    "@xcite however , very good agreement with experiment can be reached by scaling the phonon frequencies of these branches by a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite for this reason , _ the phonon frequencies are systematically scaled by a factor of @xmath14 for all calculations of the 2d band in the paper .",
    "_    the raman intensity of the 2d band is calculated using fourth - order terms in quantum - mechanical perturbation theory.@xcite the required electron - photon and electron - phonon matrix elements , and electronic linewidth are obtained within the ntb model .",
    "the expression for the intensity contains summation over all electronic states and over all phonons in the entire brillouin zone .",
    "the convergence of the raman shift of the 2d band within 1 @xmath8 is achieved by increasing the size of the monkhorst - pack mesh of points up to @xmath15 .",

    "is scattered between states of the cone - like conduction ( valence ) bands at the k and k@xmath17 points of the brillouin zone of graphene ( so - called dirac cones ) by two phonons with opposite wavevectors close to the k point ( fig .",
    "the resulting 2d band is centered at roughly twice the frequency of the phonons .",
    "each k point has three neighboring k@xmath17 points and therefore there are three scattering paths kk@xmath17 . due to the hexagonal symmetry of perfect graphene , the scattering along the three paths yields equal contribution to the raman shift and intensity of the 2d band .",
    "it has been debated in the literature about the relative contribution to the 2d band from phonons close to the @xmath29k and km directions in the brillouin zone.@xcite such phonons and the associated processes are often called `` inner '' and  outer \" , respectively .",
    "some authors have concluded that the contributions from these processes are comparable,@xcite while others have found that the contribution from `` outer '' processes is negligible compared to that from `` inner '' ones.@xcite it has also been argued that the phonon wavevector for a seemingly `` outer '' process can be transformed by a reciprocal lattice vector to a phonon wavevector for an equivalent `` inner '' process ,  thereby dismissing the notion of inner and outer processes\".@xcite in a recent study , we have proposed a quantitative criterion for distinction between the two processes .",
    "@xcite we have noted that ( 1 ) the phonons with largest contribution to the 2d band belong exclusively to the to phonon branch and ( 2 ) the to branch is the fifth one close to the @xmath29k direction and the sixth one close to the km direction ( in order of increasing frequency ) . based on these observations , we have defined unambiguously `` inner '' and `` outer '' processes as processes due to phonons from the fifth and sixth phonon branches close to the k point , respectively . using this definition ,",
    "we have shown that in unstrained graphene the ratio of the contributions to the 2d band from `` inner '' and `` outer '' processes is about 10 .",
    "the calculated 2d band of unstrained graphene has a symmetric shape ( fig .  2 , dotted line ) .",
    "this result is a direct consequence of the dominant contribution from `` inner '' processes and is in agreement with the observed symmetric shape of the 2d band.@xcite       ( z - strain ) , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath1 ( a - strain ) , at @xmath30 ev , and for parallel / perpendicular light polarization ( solid / dashed lines ) in comparison with that at zero strain ( dotted line ) . in most cases ,",
    "two raman features are clearly seen .",

    "the spectra at @xmath9 = @xmath4 , @xmath28 , and @xmath5 ev are also calculated but are not provided here . in all cases , two or three 2d subbands are present . in order to explain their origin",
    ", we note that in strained graphene , the electronic and phonon dispersions are modified differently along the three paths kk@xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the 2d band splits into two or three subbands depending on the strain direction . the subbands , coming from paths 1 , 2 , and 3 , are denoted here by 2d@xmath33 , 2d@xmath34 , and 2d@xmath35 , respectively .",
    "these subbands are mainly due to `` inner '' processes , while the contributions from `` outer '' processes give rise to minor peaks and kinks , which deform slightly the shape of the 2d subbands .",

    "figure  2 ( lower right panel ) shows that for @xmath22 @xmath1 only two raman features are present , namely , the 2d@xmath35 subband and the composite 2d@xmath34 + 2d@xmath33 band .",
    "the red ( blue ) shift of the subbands changes with @xmath38 similarly to the cases of the values of @xmath21 considered above .",
    "next , we compare the shape of the obtained 2d band to available experimental raman spectra of strained graphene . as a general feature , two 2d raman peaks are usually observed .",
