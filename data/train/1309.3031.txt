    "the modified geodetic brane gravity ( mgbg ) @xcite is an effective theory consisting of the regge - teitelboim model ( rt ) , also named geodetic brane gravity ( gbg )  @xcite plus a geometric linear @xmath0 term which is , under certain conditions , responsible of mimic some features of the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) theory  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 denotes the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the codimension one worldvolume swept out by a dynamical brane and , this is a measurement of how the brane elements are oriented in the bulk . apart from the cosmological constant , the inclusion of this term into the rt model can be regarded as a minimum geometric extension that also leads to second - order equations of motion . in several frameworks",
    "such extrinsic curvature term has been studied : in the differential geometry of hypersurfaces  @xcite , in the study of the bending and shape of phospholipid membranes  @xcite and , in the relativistic context , such a term has been considered to improve the extensible gravitational dirac model of the electron  @xcite as well as being considered an effective @xmath1 field brane theory with possible applications in cosmology and particle physics  @xcite .",
    "the rt model was originally motivated to describe our universe in a point- or string - like fashion where our universe is a @xmath2-dimensional extended object geodesically floating in a fixed higher - dimensional bulk  @xcite .",
    "the associated brane - like cosmology was studied in  @xcite .",
    "differential geometry aspects discussed in  @xcite show that to locally embed a metric on a surface , propagating in a @xmath3-dimensional flat background spacetime , the isometric embedding theorems dictate that @xmath4 dimensions are required .",
    "in particular , for @xmath5 , a ten - dimensional flat background is necessary .",
    "however , if the @xmath2-metric on the surface admits some killing vector fields , @xmath3 can be reduced significantly  @xcite .",
    "the above arguments can also be applied when we include such @xmath0 term and , in this sense , it is attractive to implement mgbg for cosmology and in particular in quantum cosmology .",
    "geometrically , mgbg is conformed only by the first three lovelock brane invariants associated to the worldvolume  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the hypersurfaces described by such terms are characterized by a single degree of freedom associated only with the geometric configuration of the system  @xcite .",
    "relating to this fact there is a linkage with a peculiar set of second - order scalar field theories , free of ghosts , and considered as local modifications of gravity where the scalar degree of freedom @xmath6 , the so - called _ galileon _ , is a type of brane bending mode @xcite .",
    "there is thus a strong interest in all these classes of second - order lagrangians , mainly for their potential applications at the cosmological level .    within the minisuperspace framework it was shown in  @xcite that the introduction of the linear @xmath0 term provides an alternative mechanism to contrast the cosmological constant effects into the geodetic brane dynamics thus supplying a dynamical equivalence with the dgp model where the self-(non - self)-accelerated expansion of such brane - like universe is mediated by the sign of the constant @xmath7 accompanying to the @xmath0 term .",
    "conventionally this quantity is considered as the gibbons - hawking - york boundary term but , from the fact that we are not considering the bulk gravity to be dynamical , this second - order term is simply another possible geometrical invariant associated with the worldvolume which also leads to second - order equations of motion . a natural extension of the work developed in  @xcite is the one associated with the quantum approach in order to know some interesting features such as the brane nucleation of this type of universes . in this regards , the quantum theory associated with this brane model involves some technical troubles of considerable complexity where most part of the issues come from the linear dependence on the acceleration of the brane in the lagrangian .",
    "commonly this fact leads us to identify a divergence term that can be naively neglected without affecting the dynamics of the theory but , getting rid of such a term sometimes results harmful at hamiltonian level as we can not obtain constraints quadratic in the momenta in a straightforward way  @xcite . to obtain a form which would be appropriate for quantization , a robust prescription consists in maintain the second - order nature of the model and then to use a hamiltonian development supported by a dirac s procedure for second - order constrained systems  @xcite .",
    "this paper provides a companion to @xcite where the classical aspects of the mgbg within the minisuperspace framework are undertaken . after an ostrogradski hamiltonian treatment for constrained systems we find that , to obtain quadratic constraints in the momenta allowing for a canonical quantization , it is necessary to invoke a suitable canonical transformation followed of a gauge fixation .",
    "we thus obtain a wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) type equation where an involved quantum potential emerges .",
    "an exhaustive analysis of this potential is done and it is found that a classically disconnected embryonic epoch ( a characteristic feature of geodetic brane - like quantum cosmology ) is still present .",
    "in fact , this embryo exists whenever the conserved energy @xmath8 , which is conjugate to the external time coordinate , is not zero .",
    "this quantum treatment paves the way to estimate the probability of creation for this brane - like universe . in this",
    "regards we observe that , for negative values of @xmath7 the creation of this type of accelerated universes is more probable , contrary to the case of positive values for @xmath7 .",
    "further , the nucleation rate for the particular case of a vanishing energy @xmath8 is analyzed .",
    "it is shown that such probability resembles the one for general relativity by defining an effective cosmological constant in terms of the @xmath7 parameter .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we present a brief review of the modified geodetic brane gravity in order to set the physical stage .",
    "we specialize to a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric on the brane embedded in a flat background .",
    "this minimal embedding calls for only one extra dimension . then we obtain an effective lagrangian . in secs .",
    "[ sec3 ] and  [ sec4 ] we have succeeded in showing that by using an ostrogradski hamiltonian formulation besides a unique canonical transformation it is possible to obtain quadratic constraints in the physical momenta in order to pave the way to a naive canonical quantization .",
    "further , we find a truncated virasoro structure in the first - class constraint algebra .",
    "we establish a wdw equation in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] where the emerging quantum potential is analyzed .",
    "in addition , the nucleation probability for this brane - like universe is calculated for a special case in sec .",

    "it is possible to consider some matter lagrangians into the action  ( [ eq : action ] ) .",
    "once matter is included , the form of the equations of motion is not affected  @xcite . in this work we will only consider the cosmological constant effects , for simplicity .",
    "the mgbg possesses as a main symmetry the invariance under reparametrizations of @xmath9 .",
    "a variational procedure yields the equation of motion  @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the worldvolume einstein tensor .",
    "this compact geometrically form represents a single second - order differential equation in derivatives of @xmath31 because of the presence of the extrinsic curvature tensor .",

    "fortunately , from a second - order derivative viewpoint , a robust prescription lies in to maintain intact the lagrangian  ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) followed by an ostrogradski hamiltonian approach as we will see shortly .",
    "given the second - order lagrangian  ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) , we must note that due to its linear dependence on the acceleration , this is degenerate but stable , as we will discuss below by using the dirac s framework needed to deal with constrained systems  @xcite .",

    "we find a potential given by @xmath184 where now the @xmath123 function satisfies the algebraic equation @xmath185 .",
    "this potential is depicted in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) for positive values of @xmath7 where , in addition , it is compared with those cases where the cosmological constant is non - zero .        it is expected that the potential function ( [ pot-2 ] ) may arise from a quantum version of the model for an accelerated universe without cosmological constant reported in  @xcite . for this brane - like universe",
    "we see that the creation from _ nothing _ to a region of unbounded expansion is possible and it is privileged whenever we consider a cosmological constant on the brane",
    ". moreover , for small values of the parameter @xmath186 and @xmath187 the potential barrier grows rapidly making harder the analysis of the tunneling effects .",
    "we further observe , as long as @xmath188 , for the range of small values for @xmath163 we still have an embryonic epoch because in such regions the universe can exist classically .",
    "in fact , the embryonic epoch takes place whenever the brane energy @xmath188 which is the main element of the unified brane gravity  @xcite . in this",
    "regard , fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) shows that the embryonic region is bigger for small values of @xmath186 and large values of @xmath8 .",
    "in the quantum cosmology framework the whole universe is described by a wavefunction . the question of the right boundary conditions for the wavefunction is hard to answer because , unlike ordinary quantum mechanics where boundary conditions for the wavefunction are fixed by the physical set - up external to the system , in 4d quantum cosmology there is nothing external giving as a consequence that this question does not have a clear resolution  @xcite . in our case",
    ", the existing embedding spacetime makes the main difference .",
    "this is so because the presence of the bulk space gives , without ambiguity , the following interpretation : the hartle - hawking and linde boundary conditions include parts that correspond to expanding and contracting universe whereas the tunneling boundary condition only includes an expanding component for the universe ( see the discussion , for example , in @xcite ) .",
    "we opt to think that this brane - like universe was a small nearly spherical brane nucleating in a minkowski background spacetime and we choose the tunneling boundary condition as the right boundary condition because it corresponds to the idea that the tunneling mechanism was the process involved in the nucleation of this universe .    for our case , by a wkb approximation it is possible to calculate the nucleation probability considering the tunneling boundary condition driven by the involved potential  ( [ eq : potential2 ] ) as follows  @xcite @xmath189 where , @xmath190 and @xmath191 are the turning points of the potential . clearly , this expression is hard to work out .",
    "a special case focused on the very early universe is contained in the case @xmath192 . from eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) the @xmath123 function reduces to @xmath178 . under this condition the effective quantum potential  ( [ eq : potential2 ] ) takes the form @xmath193 .",

    "the opposite situation occurs whenever @xmath198 .",
    "associated with this case , when @xmath199 and @xmath192 , and by using the potential  ( [ pot-2 ] ) we have that @xmath200 from this expression we may also identify another effective cosmological constant given by @xmath201 .",
    "these results together suggest that in general , at quantum level , the parameter @xmath186 still continues to modify the cosmological constant , as it was elucidated at a classical level in  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have canonically quantized the modified regge - teitelboim brane model within a minisuperspace framework .",
    "the associated brane - like universe also constitutes a controlled deviation from einstein limit provided the bulk energy @xmath8 and the @xmath7 parameter vanish . by means of an ostrogradski hamiltonian procedure besides the introduction of a suitable canonical transformation followed of a gauge fixing procedure , we have succeeded in finding constraints quadratic in the momenta .",
    "the canonical quantization scheme is possible once the dirac brackets enter the game .",
    "the resulting wdw type equation allows to identify a quantum potential .",
    "we calculated then the nucleation probability using the wkb approximation for the simple case @xmath192 .",
    "for this case , the higher probability for the nucleation of the brane universe is obtained by considering the highest value of the resulting effective cosmological constant that is constructed with the cosmological constant @xmath28 and the @xmath7 parameter . for the case of positive @xmath7",
    "there is a relation between @xmath7 and @xmath28 in order to get the maximum probability . for @xmath170",
    "the maximum probability is achieved for the largest absolute values of @xmath7 and @xmath28 . for a non - zero brane cosmological constant ,",
    "the parameter @xmath7 which plays akin role to the crossover scale @xmath171 in the self - accelerated branch of the dgp model , is similar to a cosmological constant at a quantum level . in some manner",
    ", this is consistent with the results reported in  @xcite , where the self - accelerated expansion on this type of universes is due to a negative value of the parameter @xmath7 . based on the previous results ,",
    "it is worth to mention that exist the possibility that the nucleation probability for the dgp model follows a similar pattern .",
    "another way to extend our work resides in the direction of trying to extract some physical observable consequences from the nucleation rate .",
    "for example , we can use an inflaton field on the brane , within a particular inflationary model , with the purpose to calculate some of most probable observable cosmological parameters and to investigate its corresponding physical implications.this will be the subject of future work .",
    "we believe also that this model will serve as precursor to obtain more enriched geometrical theories . in this sense ,",
    "lovelock brane models  @xcite are guesses at alternative physical theories that might underlie the cosmic acceleration that deserve a more detailed exploration .",
    "we will report elsewhere the cosmological implications of consider , for example , a cubic correction term in the extrinsic curvature to the rt model through the so - called gibbons - hawking - york - myers term , @xmath202  @xcite .",
