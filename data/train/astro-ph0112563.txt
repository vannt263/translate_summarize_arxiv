    "scalar - tensor ( st ) theories of gravity provide a natural alternative to general relativity ( gr ) . they describe gravity with not only a metric @xmath1 but also a scalar field @xmath2 .",
    "derivatives of @xmath2 appear as source terms in the field equations and @xmath2 itself satisfies a wave equation . the strength of the gravitational coupling is determined by the function @xmath3 , where gr is recovered in the limits @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "st theories can also be regarded as being equivalent to gr with a varying gravitational `` constant '' @xmath0 .",
    "the most simple example of such a st theory is brans - dicke theory @xcite , where @xmath3 is constant and @xmath6 .",
    "however , weak field experiments have shown that @xmath7 @xcite and so the deviation from gr is small . for more general st theories , where @xmath8 is not constant , it is possible that @xmath8 was much smaller at earlier times .",
    "so observations allow such theories to greatly deviate from gr in the early universe .",
    "there has been a renewed interest in st theories in recent years due to the effective low energy actions of string theory involving one or more scalar fields .",
    "these scalar fields enter the field equations in much the same way as the scalar field in st theories @xcite .",
    "also , the increasing popularity of inflation and quintessence suggests that scalar fields might need to be incorporated into cosmological models .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the effect of an evolving scalar field on the formation and evolution of a primordial black hole . in an asymptotically flat spacetime",
    "it is well known that a black hole radiates away any inhomogeneities in the scalar field until it becomes a stationary solution with constant @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the famous `` no hair '' theorem .",
    "however , in st cosmological models the scalar field is evolving with time and this would modify how the black hole evolves during its lifetime .",
    "barrow @xcite was the first to examine this problem .",
    "he considered the two extreme possibilities : scenario ( a ) , where the scalar field evolves everywhere homogeneously in the same way as the cosmological background ; and scenario ( b ) , where the black hole forces the scalar field to remain constant in some local region around it .",
    "the second scenario barrow called gravitational memory because the black hole would locally preserve the value of the scalar field from when it formed .",
    "barrow & carr @xcite studied the evolution of primordial black holes for these scenarios and found that either case results in a significant deviation from the usual gr analysis .",
    "they considered st theories , where @xmath9 as in the brans - dicke case .",
    "since @xmath2 increases with cosmological time , this implies that @xmath10 decreases , so black holes would take longer to radiate away their mass via hawking evaporation than in the gr case . in both scenarios the black holes",
    "form when gravity is stronger , so the rate of evaporation is less , but in scenario ( b ) the strength never decreases and so the lifetime is even longer .",
    "the above scenarios are the two extremes and the reality is probably somewhere in between .",
    "two more general scenarios have been proposed @xcite . in scenario ( c )",
    "the scalar field evolves faster at the event horizon ( eh ) than at the particle horizon ( ph ) , so @xmath11 .",
    "eventually the black hole must reach a stage where @xmath12 , but this does not necessarily mean the scalar field is homogeneous since there could be some lag between the asymptotic and local increase . in scenario ( d ) , the scalar field is evolving locally but at a slower rate than asymptotically , so @xmath13 .",
    "there is still some gravitational memory but not in the strict sense of scenario ( b ) . in this scenario",
    "the gradient of the scalar field is increasing but one would expect there to be some limit , due to the influx of scalar gravitational waves .",
    "gravitational memory for black holes which are small compared to the cosmological scale ( i.e. the particle horizon ) has already been investigated by jacobson @xcite . in this case , the scalar field evolution can be considered as an asymptotic perturbation to the schwarzschild metric and the end - state of scenario ( c ) applies , with the lag being found to be small .",
    "this suggests that gravitational memory is virtually non - existent .",
    "however , this approximation may not apply for primordial black holes since these can have a size comparable to the particle horizon at formation @xcite .",
    "it is still not clear what would happen in this case . therefore another way of investigating gravitational memory , without assuming that the black hole is small , is needed .",
    "in gr there have been several attempts to study analytic solutions which represent black holes within a cosmological background .",
    "the earliest used the einstein - straus solution @xcite , which matches a schwarzschild interior to a friedmann exterior , and this approach has also been used to study gravitational memory @xcite .",
    "however , in most circumstances it can be shown @xcite that such a matching is only possible if the scalar field is constant , which just gives the gr solution .",
    "another method used the mcvittie metric @xcite , but it has been shown @xcite that this has a scalar curvature singularity at the event horizon .",
    "a more successful method uses the tolman - bondi metric @xcite to represent the collapse of dust to a black hole in an asymptotically friedmann background .",
    "however , this only works for dust and can not in general be applied to st theories due to the derivatives of the scalar field appearing as source terms in the field equations . in this paper",
    "we overcome this problem by assuming that the effect of the scalar field on the spacetime is small compared to that of the matter .",
    "this means that we can use the usual einstein field equations to generate the spacetime and then use the wave equation for the scalar field to determine its evolution .",
    "this approximation was used by harada et al .",
    "@xcite to calculate the scalar gravitational radiation emitted by oppenheimer - snyder collapse in st theory .",
    "jacobson also uses this approximation when calculating the effect of an evolving scalar field in schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we note , however , that self - consistent numerical calculations of spherical gravitational collapse in st theory in asymptotic flat spacetime , in which the effect of the scalar field on the spacetime is fully incorporated , have been considered by previous authors @xcite .",
    "if one makes this approximation to investigate gravitational collapse in a tolman - bondi spacetime , the solution is specified by two arbitrary functions : the energy and mass functions . to represent collapse in a friedmann background ,",
    "the energy function has to be negative within some radius @xmath14 and zero outside it .",
    "this results in the eventual gravitational collapse of all the matter within @xmath14 , while the matter outside @xmath14 expands forever as in a flat friedmann model . in choosing the mass function , or equivalently the density perturbation",
    ", we adopt the  compensated \" model .",
    "this means that the overdense region in the centre is surrounded by an underdense region outside , so that the total mass at infinity is unaffected .",
    "we solve the field equations numerically using the characteristic method .",
    "this method was first applied to an inhomogeneous and dynamical background spacetime by iguchi et al . @xcite .",
    "the characteristic method integrates over null hypersurfaces with the event horizon as a boundary .",
    "this means that one never needs to calculate anything inside the black hole , thereby avoiding any numerical problems associated with singularities .",
    "the output of the code shows the spatial and temporal variation of the scalar field .",
    "the figures produced show that the initial collapse results in a large gradient in the scalar field .",
    "however , as time increases , the scalar field becomes almost homogeneous .",
    "this suggests that , within the approximation used , gravitational memory is not possible .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the back reaction of the scalar field could alter this conclusion .    in section",
    "ii we describe st theories in more detail and derive the field equations for the approximation in which the effect of the scalar field on the metric is neglected . in section iii",
    "we transform the tolman - bondi solution into null coordinates , giving the equations necessary to apply the characteristic method . in section",
    "iv we specify the model giving rise to black hole formation .",
    "we present the numerical results in section v and discuss their implications in section vi .",
    "for scalar - tensor theories of gravity with @xmath9 the field equations are    @xmath15    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the usual energy - momentum tensor , @xmath18 is its trace and we have set @xmath19 . in brans - dicke theory eq.([field1 ] ) remains unchanged but @xmath20 in eq.([field2 ] ) .",
    "these equations are expressed in the jordan frame but st theories can also be expressed in a conformal frame known as the einstein frame .",
    "the einstein frame is related to the jordan frame by the transformation    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the present value of the gravitational `` constant '' as measured in solar system experiments .",
    "it is called the einstein frame because it can be expressed as gr with a scalar field .",
    "however , the jordan frame will be used throughout this paper .    in gr",

    "there are two arbitrary functions in this solution : the mass function @xmath31 and the energy function @xmath39 .",
    "investigating collapse to a black hole just requires the appropriate choice for these functions . in this paper",
    "the energy function is chosen such that    @xmath40    @xmath41    for some @xmath14 .",
    "this means that when a perturbation is applied to the background dust , all the matter interior to @xmath14 will eventually collapse to form a black hole , while the exterior matter will expand forever as in a flat friedman universe @xcite .",
    "the mass function @xmath31 is determined by putting @xmath42 at @xmath43 in eq .",

    "the key to this approximation is that the back reaction of the scalar field is neglected .",
    "it is assumed that the effect of the scalar field on the spacetime is small compared to that of the matter .",
    "the initial configuration used is the general relativistic one with constant @xmath2 and for simplicity brans - dicke theory is used .",
    "then , to the lowest order , the evolution of @xmath2 is determined by the wave equation :    @xmath44_{tb}\\phi = \\frac{8\\pi}{3 + 2\\omega } t_{tb } \\label{eq : scalar}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45_{tb}$ ] and @xmath46 are determined for the tolman - bondi metric and the general relativistic solution . using the tolman - bondi metric ,",

    "coordinates the outgoing null geodesic is given by @xmath49 so we can write @xmath50 the coordinate system is now transformed from @xmath51 to @xmath52 using the relations    @xmath53    where @xmath54 the partial derivatives are then related by @xmath55 in this coordinate system the metric becomes @xmath56.\\ ] ]    to use the characteristic method it is necessary to introduce the derivative along the ingoing radial null geodesic . in the original coordinates the ingoing null geodesic is given by    @xmath57    which in the new coordinate system becomes    @xmath58    therefore the derivative along the ingoing null can be obtained :    @xmath59    the partial derivatives @xmath60 and @xmath61 can now be rewritten in terms of @xmath62 and @xmath63 :    @xmath64    the wave operator then becomes    @xmath65\\phi = -\\frac{2}{\\alpha ar}\\frac{d\\varphi}{du } -\\frac{a^{\\prime}}{a^{3 } r}\\varphi + \\frac{1}{ar}\\left[(a\\dot{r})^{\\cdot}-\\left(\\frac{r^{\\prime}}{a}\\right ) ^{\\prime}\\right]\\phi\\\\\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 here @xmath67 and @xmath68 refer to the operators given in eq.([partialt ] ) and eq.([partialr ] ) respectively .",
    "it is also necessary to obtain an equation for @xmath69 .",
    "this is achieved by using @xmath70 , which gives    @xmath71    applying the full tolman - bondi solution , the basic equations that must be solved in brans - dicke theory are to first order    @xmath72    where the upper and lower signs correspond to an expanding and collapsing phase respectively . for numerical purposes",

    "equation  ( [ eq : f ] ) means that the central region @xmath85 is described by the exact closed friedmann solution , which ensures that there is no shell - focusing naked singularity .",
    "more general situations in which shell - focusing is avoided have been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the code continually monitors for shell - crossing to check that this never happens within the calculated region .",
    "we then determine @xmath86 so that @xmath24 coincides with @xmath25 at the @xmath80 spacelike hypersurface .",
    "the choice of the function @xmath39 requires some justification since it is nowhere exactly zero in the calculated region , so strictly speaking the entire region would eventually collapse to a black hole if one waited long enough . in practice",
    ", this does not matter because our calculated region is so large that the value of @xmath87 is effectively identical to @xmath88 for @xmath89 ( i.e. at the outer boundary ) . since the region is finite",

    "we denote the hubble parameter in the friedmann background ( far from the perturbed region ) as @xmath95 at @xmath80 .",
    "recall that @xmath83 gives the amplitude of the density perturbation , while @xmath84 gives the size of the perturbed region . for super - horizon scale perturbations",
    ", we can not set the density perturbation to be very large else the overdense region closes up on itself and becomes disconnected from the rest of the universe @xcite .",
    "actually , the requirement @xmath81 imposes an even stronger condition since it implies @xmath96 .",
    "we have set the brans - dicke parameter to be @xmath97 .",
    "if @xmath83 is much increased , then the amplitude of the overdensity is much decreased and the resulting black hole becomes very small compared with the horizon scale at the formation time . if @xmath83 is much decreased , the overdense region becomes a separate closed universe .",

    "it is seen that a nearly horizon - scale black hole is formed for model a , while the black hole is smaller than the horizon scale for models b , c and f. this is because the size of the black hole is always roughly @xmath100 , whereas the time at which it forms is about @xmath100 in model a and closer to @xmath101 in the other cases .",
    "the initial data for the scalar field are set on the initial null cauchy surface ( see fig .  [",
    "fg : penrose ] ) .",
    "we prepare three sets of initial data , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fg : initialdata ] .",
    "we have investigated all the models listed in table  [ tb : models ] and the results are seen in figs .",
    "[ fg : tp]-[fg : horizon ] . in fig .",
    "[ fg : tp ] , the profile of the scalar field is plotted for constant @xmath105 . in fig .  [ fg : rp ] , it is plotted for constant @xmath25 .",
    "the reason why some of the curves come to an abrupt end _ below _",
    "some value of @xmath25 is that the event horizon has formed near the center and we did not calculate the evolution of the scalar field inside the event horizon .",
    "the reason why some of them come to an abrupt end _ above _ some value of @xmath25 is due to the finiteness of the region in which the numerical calculation is done .",
    "we note that collapse ensures that the scalar field is initially concentrated in the central regions and this means that it rises above the asymptotic cosmological value everywhere",
    ". however , this central concentration tends to fall due to the underdensity surrounding the black hole .",
    "this effect , coupled with the increase of the cosmological value , means that the scalar field necessarily falls below the cosmological value at sufficiently large values of @xmath25 , at least for the models under consideration .",
    "eventually it may do so at every plotted value of @xmath25 .",
    "strictly speaking , the issue of gravitational memory is concerned with the process whereby the scalar field is _ raised _ to the cosmological value once it has fallen below it rather than with the process whereby it initially _ falls _ to the cosmological value .",
    "generally , the configuration of the scalar field tends to spatially homogeneity with increasing time and the value of the scalar field around the black hole follows the cosmological evolution of the scalar field at each moment . to see this more clearly , we identify the value of the scalar field on the latest null ray within the calculation as the value on the black hole event horizon , @xmath106 , because the null ray is very close to the event horizon for each model ( at least for @xmath107 , see fig .",
    "[ fg : null ] ) . both @xmath102 and @xmath106",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fg : horizon ] .",
    "the end of the curve @xmath106 corresponds to the formation time of the event horizon .",
    "we can see that @xmath106 follows the evolution of @xmath102 .",
    "there is a small deviation of @xmath106 from @xmath102 but this can be explained by the central overdensity and the surrounding underdensity . for @xmath108 ,",
    "the event horizon runs through the overdense region and hence the scalar field is amplified compared with @xmath102 .",
    "thereafter the event horizon runs through the underdense region and so the scalar field is reduced compared with @xmath102 .",
    "the overall evolution of @xmath106 is well described by @xmath102 .",
    "although there are minor differences among the models , we can conclude that the configuration of the scalar field is nearly spatially homogeneous and well described by the cosmological solution @xmath102 , at least for around ten initial hubble times after the formation of the event horizon .",
    "we have calculated the evolution of the brans - dicke scalar field in the presence of a primordial black hole formed in a flat friedmann background .",
    "we have found that the value of the scalar field at the event horizon almost always maintains the cosmological value .",
    "this suggests that primordial black holes `` forget '' the value of the gravitational constant at their formation epoch . in this sense",
    ", we confirm the result of jacobsen @xcite , although he never carried out an explicit evolutionary calculation .",
    "while it is possible that some choices of the function @xmath39 might lead to a different conclusion , we would claim that our conclusion must at least hold in compensated models .",
    "for we have tried many sets of parameters , corresponding to models which describe a wide variety of physical situations , and this always seems to be the case .",
    "however , it is not clear from our analysis what would happen for non - compensated models and we have also avoided models with shell - crossing singularities , so we do not claim that our result is completely general .",
    "it should also be stressed that this result has only been demonstrated for a dust universe in which the scalar field does not appreciably affect the background curvature and it remains to be seen whether the same conclusion applies when this assumption is dropped . as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fg : tp ] and [ fg : rp ] , both the radial gradient and the time derivative of @xmath2 are large at early times and both of these act as source terms in the field equations .",
    "however , as long as @xmath8 is large , this is unlikely to stop the scalar field becoming homogeneous eventually , since it is clear that both the radial gradient and time derivative become small well after the initial collapse .",
    "neglecting the back reaction should therefore be a reasonable assumption in this situation , so gravitational memory seems unlikely .",
    "however , this conclusion might not apply for @xmath109 .",
