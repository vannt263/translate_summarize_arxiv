    "the correlation is not as good .",
    "nevertheless , the position of the light curve minimum at phase 0.5 is approximately reproduced .",
    "the poor correlation of the observed and calculated v - curves can be explained by the poor phase coverage and the small number of spectroscopic phases in the observations .",
    "our tests show that removing the small cool spots at the phases 0.00.3 from the image makes the calculated light curve follow the observations better .",
    "these small spots are most likely artifacts caused by the noise in the observations and by the fact that only one spectrum has been taken during these phases . the noisy data and the poor phase coverage also explain the noisiness of the map and the higher spot temperatures than in the other maps .",
    "due to the reasonable reproduction of the shape and position of the light curve minimum , as shown in our test , the surface position of the main feature in the map is considered reliable .",

    "the temperature range in the map is from 3709  k to 5640  k. the coolest feature in the map consist of two spots : the cooler one near phase 0.75 in the latitude interval of @xmath16 has a temperature @xmath13  k below the unspotted surface and the weaker spot at phase 0.9 in the latitude interval @xmath17 is @xmath18  k cooler than the unspotted surface .",

    "[ cc ] shows the temperature maps for the years 1994 - 1997 and the results from a cross - correlation between consecutive images .",
    "all the temperature maps show an extended active region , which can be resolved into two strong spots .",
    "the latitude range of the spots is quite stable from year to year , @xmath19 . on the other hand",
    ", the longitude of the active region seems to move about 0.2 in phase within a year .",
    "the cross - correlation maps have been obtained by calculating the cross - correlation function for each individual latitude strip and then plotting them together as a map . as can be seen in the fig .",
    "[ cc ] , the maximum of the cross - correlation function is obtained at the latitudes where the main spot features are located . in the cross - correlation procedure , each strip is individually normalized to the average fluctuations of that strip to get the proper value of the cross - correlation function .",
    "due to this normalization in some images very small scale temperature variations are correlated and result in quite high values of cross - correlation function .",
    "this phenomenon is seen in some images as strong features at very low latitudes ( between latitudes @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "the cross - correlation confirms the migration rate to be on average @xmath0 in phase during one year .",
    "when calculating the average shift , the average of the cross - correlation function over all the latitudes with spots ( @xmath22@xmath23 ) was used .",
    "a 2nd order polynomial fit is then applied to determine the phase of the maximum of the cross - correlation function .",
    "the cross - correlation between april 1997 and june 1997 was excluded from the measurements , because it lead to a much larger error in the result , @xmath24 .",
    "this is most likely due to a short - term rapid evolution of the active region during spring 1997 .",
    "our photometry from the end of 1997 shows a very different light - curve shape and behaviour than in early 1997 ( korhonen @xcite ) .",
    "this might be caused by the so - called flip - flop phenomenon , where the longitude of the active region switches by @xmath25 ( cf .",
    "jetsu @xcite ) .",
    "the rapid evolution during spring 1997 might indicate the start of a new flip - flop.    the spot evolution on the shorter time scales can be studied with the four maps obtained in 1996 and 1997 . in the cross - correlation between the june - july 1996 and july - august 1996 maps",
    "it can be seen that these two maps are similar and no significant differences between them is revealed .",
    "the only difference is the small phase shift of the active region .",
    "this phase shift is about 0.016 during the 30 day period .",
    "the shift has been determined from all the latitudes between @xmath22 and @xmath23 using a 2nd order polynomial fit to the values of the cross - correlation function .",
    "the shift obtained is in good agreement with the migration predicted from the shift of the active region during the four year period ( 0.019 in phase in 30 days ) .",
    "similarly , the cross - correlation between april and june 1997 maps shows a phase shift of 0.063 , which is to be compared with the predicted shift of 0.045 within 72 days .",
    "the detected migration of the active region is probably caused by a difference between the adopted rotation period and the real period .",
    "if this is true then the real period is @xmath1 ( using additionally the cross - correlation between april 1997 and june 1997 gives @xmath26 ) . due to the solid body rotation of the stellar surface within the spotted latitudes ( see sect .  [ diff ] ) , this value can be taken to be representative of the stellar rotation .",
    "the stability of the active region during a four year period and the very similar substructures within it indicate that the inversion method used in this work is quite reliable and that the active regions in fk  com are stable between the anticipated flip - flop s .",
    "( 0,92 ) ( 5,0 )    ( 0,0 )    the results from the cross - correlation were also used for checking the possibility of surface differential rotation .",
    "measurements from all the maps and all the latitudes with spots ( @xmath27 ) were used to determine the possible differential rotation described by the parameter @xmath3 as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the equatorial and polar angular velocities , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , there are no spots near the equator .",
    "so , a comparison latitude ( @xmath31 ) other than the equator must be used . with a @xmath32 law",
    "the angular velocity at any latitude can be expressed as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the latitude and @xmath35 the angular velocity at this latitude .",
    "the polar angular velocity can be obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : omega ] and @xmath3 can then be represented as : @xmath36    the value of @xmath37 can be determined from the measurements of the longitudinal shifts at different latitudes .",
    "these are expressed in phases and are plotted in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ difrot ] .",
    "the shifts comprise the annual migration plus a possible differential rotation . to remove the annual migration , we have chosen the lowest latitude which always has spots in our maps as the comparison latitude ( @xmath38 ) and subtracted the average shift at this latitude ( dashed line in the plot ) from the measurements .",
    "then , the residual shift in degrees per day for each latitude can be expressed as : @xmath39 they are plotted in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ difrot ] . in the plot",
    "the standard deviations are shown as error bars .",
    "then @xmath37 can be determined by using a first order polynomial fit with the inverse of the variance of the average in each point as the weight .",
    "the fit resulted in @xmath40 . for the calculation of @xmath3 the angular velocity at the equator is still needed .",
    "that can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) , after the velocity at the comparison latitude is known .",
    "for @xmath38 we get @xmath41 , which gives @xmath42 .",
    "together with @xmath37 this yields @xmath2 .",
    "this result is consistent with solid body rotation of the stellar surface . for further pinpointing differential rotation , more maps extending the time span",
    "would be needed .",

    "a flare had been identified by oliveira & foing ( @xcite ) .",
    "h@xmath3 observations at these phases were not used when comparing with the june 1997 map .    to search for a correlation of the chromospheric activity with the photospheric spots , we use the measurements of residual emission in the blue and red wings of h@xmath3-line ( at radial velocities of @xmath43kms@xmath44 ) .",

    "[ chromo]c shows the average temperature distribution in the june 1997 map calculated from the spotted latitudes , @xmath45@xmath46 , and a 2nd degree harmonic fit . from the comparison",
    "we see that the emission in the blue wing is the strongest at the phase of the photospheric active region , while the maximum of the emission in the red wing is shifted by approximately 0.5 in phase from that .",
    "we also note that the maximum and the amplitude of the h@xmath3 emission has the same value in both wings .",
    "these observations can be interpreted with a simple model of constant emission from the chromosphere , seen during the minimum of the emission , and matter flowing up from the active region and resulting in variable rotationally modulated emission . when the spots are at the centre of the disk the flow is strongest towards the earth , so the largest emission is seen in the blue wing .",
    "half a rotation later the flow is pointed away and the strongest emission is seen in the red wing .",
    "this model suggests hot active plages in the chromosphere in the vicinity of the spots with outflows of about 200kms@xmath44 . the similar amount of emission in the blue and red wings during the minima implies a more - or - less constant emission from the chromosphere .",
    "the limited number of h@xmath3 observations makes these results very preliminary . having obtained observations simultaneously in h@xmath3 and the spectral region used for surface imaging for the years 19981999 , we intend to study this possible correlation in more detail later .",

    "the active region is stable for at least 4 years . 2 .",
    "the active region moves on average @xmath47 in phase within a year .",
    "this migration is probably caused by a difference between the adopted rotation period and the real period ; if this is true then the real rotation period is @xmath48 .",
    "no evidence for surface differential rotation could be found from temperature maps separated by 30 days , 72 days and about a year . assuming a @xmath32 law , measurements from latitudes between @xmath49 and @xmath23 give @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the difference between polar and equatorial angular velocities relative to the equatorial angular velocity .",
    "this result indicates a solid body rotation of the stellar surface .",
    "4 .   comparison between our june 1997 temperature map and the chromospheric activity observed in h@xmath3 suggests the presence of hot plages in the chromosphere in the vicinity of the spots with outflows of about 200kms@xmath44 .",
