    "moreover nonlinear brownian motion with multiplicative gaussian white noise @xcite , as well as linear boltzmann equation with scattering events being distributed in time according to a power law distribution @xcite may display anomalous diffusion .",

    "this in general leads to a non - markovian process of the particle dynamics with _ linear _ memory friction and gaussian fluctuating force .",

    "the variance of the particle s position will grow with time .",
    "the law according to which the variance grows characterizes the nature of the resulting diffusion process as being subdiffusive if the growth of the variance is slower than linear .",
    "this happens if the static friction @xmath19 diverges .",
    "normal diffusion corresponds to a linear growth .",
    "it occurs if @xmath20 is finite .",

    "if this integral is zero , then the motion is anti - persistent and subdiffusive .",
    "if this integral diverges the spread of the position variance is superdiffusive . for free motion in the absence of a potential these criteria are equivalent to those for the memory kernel which in general fail in the presence of a potential . since general analytical results are scarce and most likely nonexistent for nonlinear and time - dependent forcing , the reliability of numerical simulations has become a key issue .",
    "numerically tractable models can be obtained by approximating the given memory kernel by a finite sum of exponential functions .",

    "the dimensionality of the markovian process is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of exponentials in the sum approximating the memory kernel .",
    "the key point is that the corresponding markovian dynamics can be propagated locally in time for very long time intervals by means of very reliable algorithms with a well controlled numerical precision .",

    "the case @xmath27 corresponds to approximating the memory kernel by a difference of two exponentials , @xmath28 such that @xmath29 implying to vanishing static friction @xmath20 and @xmath30 .",
    "the latter condition amounts to the fact that the memory kernel is proportional to the autocorrelation function of the fluctuating force @xmath31 and hence must be non - negative semidefinite .",
    "this bi - exponential model was proposed by bao @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to a super - ohmic spectral density of thermal bath oscillators , @xmath32 at low frequencies and describes the coupling of a particle to three - dimensional lattice phonons .",
    "it therefore models the diffusion of an impurity in a crystal .",

    "we will study one of the simplest embeddings which is different from those used by bao @xcite . in the absence of any force @xmath33",
    "the spreading of the particle s position distribution is ballistic , @xmath34 , and hence super - diffusive .",

    "moreover , our numerics reveals that the ballistic diffusion in tilted periodic potentials does neither depend on the initial velocity distribution , nor on the initially non - equilibrium noise preparation .",

    "the general results are illustrated with two different embeddings of one and the same superdiffusive gle dynamics . in sec .",

    "the idea that we pursue here is to represent the non - markovian stochastic dynamics of a single particle with @xmath44 phase space as a projection of a multi - dimensional markovian dynamics .",
    "it is well known that any gle can be derived from the ( markovian ) hamiltonian dynamics of a particle coupled to a thermal bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "this hamiltonian embedding though requires a large number of auxiliary degrees of freedom representing the thermal bath .",

    "@xmath58 one recovers the original gle ( [ eqn : init ] ) only under special conditions , see appendix a for details of the derivation .",

    "+ furthermore , the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ fdt ] ) imposes restrictions on the matrices @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and the vectors @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "these restrictions are met if the embedding parameters satisfy the following two relations : @xmath63 which defines the constant @xmath54 matrix @xmath64 .",
    "+ however , for arbitrary initial values of the auxiliary variables @xmath65 , the fluctuation - dissipation relation will be obeyed only asymptotically .",

    "the conditions ( [ first ] ) , ( [ gtor ] ) and ( [ eqn : cond ] ) do not uniquely determine the enlarged process and actually leave room for an infinite variety of different processes leading upon reduction to the same generalized langevin equation . since some of the enlarged processes allow faster and more reliable numerical simulations than others there is a great interest in identifying computationally optimal embeddings .",
    "we further note that the relations ( [ first ] ) , ( [ gtor ] ) and ( [ eqn : cond ] ) are sufficient but not necessary conditions .",
    "the resulting embedding is more general than previous ones such as those proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite which assume @xmath67 .    before discussing a particular example we would like to emphasize that the stationarity of the fluctuating force and the fluctuation dissipation relation  ( [ fdt ] ) are exactly implemented .",

    "we shall discuss two of them .",
    "a simple embedding is obtained by choosing : @xmath76 this choice leads to the following equations : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is scalar gaussian white noise .",

    "an alternative way is to start with a diagonal matrix @xmath52",
    ". it would be tempting to also choose diagonal matrices @xmath53 and @xmath64 .",
    "this choice though always yields a linear combination of exponential functions with positive coefficients for the memory kernel ( [ kernel ] ) @xcite and hence does not allow vanishing static friction .",
    "however , this goal can be achieved by means of the following choice of parameters involving non - diagonal matrices @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the correlation coefficient of the covariance matrix @xmath64 and @xmath86 .",
    "this choice is similar to the one in @xcite .",
    "we note that the second embedding requires that the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 must be real .",
    "therefore it is not possible to model an oscillating kernel by this method .",

    "[ fig1 ] , only small deviations at early and intermediate times are visible in the case of a tilted periodic potential . hence , numerical evidence seems to indicate that the velocity fluctuations of a ballistically diffusing particle in a tilted washboard potential indeed is wide sense ergodic .",

    "any increase of @xmath188 slower than @xmath133 , such as @xmath189 with any small , positive @xmath190 , or @xmath191 will lead to a vanishing time average of the velocity fluctuation autocorrelation function by the same argument as above . from the numerical point of view",
    "there is always a limitation of how accurate the scaling exponent of @xmath188 can be determined .",
    "logarithmic corrections are almost impossible to identify . we therefore suppose that the observed ballistic diffusion in a tilted washboard potential might strictly speaking be marginally sub - ballistic and the velocity fluctuations wide sense ergodic .    , whereas dashed lines mark initially zero velocity @xmath151 .",

    "we considered a large family of markovian embedding schemes , i.e. higher dimensional markovian processes that generate the considered non - markovian process upon projection onto the subspace spanned by position and momentum of the particle .",
    "out of the whole class we identified a simple four - dimensional embedding that can be numerically treated in an efficient way .",
    "we confirm that ballistic superdiffusion is non - ergodic , which is concordant with the findings in @xcite . as a new amazing manifestation of non - ergodicity we found that a non - equilibrium initial noise preparation can change the law of diffusion ,",

    "[ fig1 ] .    further on our numerical findings indicate that the free ballistic diffusion , being present in the absence of any potential , changes into normal diffusion in the presence of a periodic potential .",
    "we concluded that the process of the velocity fluctuations is non - ergodic in the absence of a periodic potential but wide sense ergodic in the presence of a periodic potential .",
    "apparently , the transition to the ergodic motion does not require a minimal potential strength . rather , the time to reach the asymptotic regime of normal diffusion diverges with vanishing potential strength @xmath196 .",
    "an additional biasing force leads to ballistic motion in a periodic potential , i.e. both the mean value and the variance of the position displacement grow proportional to a @xmath133 law . in this case , however we found strong indications that the velocity fluctuations remain wide sense ergodic .",
    "this paradoxically looking scenario  non - ergodic for free ballistic diffusion versus ergodic for ballistic diffusion in a potential  is possible because the ballistic diffusion presents a marginal situation .",
    "although for ballistic diffusion following a strict @xmath133 law the velocity fluctuations are non - ergodic any modification of the @xmath133 law with a weakly decaying function such as @xmath197 leads to wide sense ergodic velocity fluctuations . for a sub - critical bias @xmath198 the ballistic diffusion coefficient @xmath38",
