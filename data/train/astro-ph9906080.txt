    "in our present picture , cosmological fluctuations today are seen as the _ combination _ of an initial spectrum , which can be computed within the framework of high energy models ( like inflation ) , with the subsequent processes occuring at lower energy where the physics is believed to be better understood ( up to some unknowns such as the amount and nature of dark matter , the mass of neutrinos ... ) . in the near future , we expect new and _ precise _ information on cosmological fluctuations with the planned measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) anisotropies by the satellites map @xcite and planck @xcite . it has been emphasized in the recent years that the precision of these measurements could in principle allow us to determine with a high precision the cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "these studies however all assume very simple initial perturbations , typically gaussian adiabatic perturbations with a power - law spectrum .",
    "however , reality could turn out to be more subtle .",
    "this then would have the drawback to complicate the determination of the cosmological parameters but could open the fascinating perspective to gain precious information on the primordial universe . at present , at a time when data are still unprecise , it is essential to identify broad categories of early universe models and to determine their specificities as far as observable quantities are concerned , with the purpose to be able to discriminate between these various classes of models when detailed data will become available .",
    "ultimately , inflation must be related to a high energy physics model . today",
    "there are many viable models but a generic feature of these models is that they contain generally many scalar fields .",
    "a property of inflation with several scalar fields is that it can generate , in addition to the ubiquitous adiabatic perturbations , isocurvature perturbations . in this respect , it is important to consider the possible role of primordial isocurvature perturbations .",
    "isocurvature perturbations are perturbations in the relative density ratio between various species in the early universe , in contrast with the more standard adiabatic ( or isentropic ) perturbations which are perturbations in the total energy density with fixed particle number ratios .",
    "primordial isocurvature perturbations are , most of the time , ignored in inflationary models .",
    "the main reason for this is that they are less universal than adiabatic perturbations because , on one hand , they can be produced only in multiple inflationary models @xcite , and , on the other hand , they can survive until the present epoch only if at least one of the inflaton fields remains decoupled from ordinary matter during the whole history of the universe .",
    "however , not only the existence of isocurvature perturbations is allowed in principle , but candidates for inflatons with the required above conditions even exist in many theoretical models ( dilatons , axions ) .",
    "what has already been established is that a pure isocurvature scale - invariant spectrum must be rejected because it predicts on large scales too large temperature anisotropies with respect to density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "but other possibilities can be envisaged .",
    "several have been investigated in the literature : tilted isocurvature perturbations @xcite , combination of isocurvature and adiabatic perturbations @xcite . in the latter case , only combinations of _ independent _ isocurvature and adiabatic perturbations were considered . the aim of this paper is to investigate the possibility of _ correlated mixtures of isocurvature and adiabatic _ perturbations .    to illustrate this , the simplest model of multi - field inflation",
    "is considered here : double inflation @xcite , namely a model with two massive scalar fields without self - interaction or mutual interaction ( other than gravitational ) .",
    "the production of fluctuations in this model has been studied in great detail by polarski and starobinsky and , in the present work , their notation and formalism will be followed closely .",
    "they were interested essentially in adiabatic perturbations @xcite ( see also @xcite for a numerical analysis ) but also considered isocurvature perturbations @xcite .",
    "however , they did not investigate the range of parameters where this model has the striking property to produce correlated isocurvature and adiabatic perturbations . by this , we mean the cases where both isocurvature and adiabatic perturbations receive significant contributions of at least one of the scalar fields , in contrast to the uncorrelated case where one of the scalar fields feeds essentially the adiabatic perturbations while the second one is at the origin of the isocurvature perturbations .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following . in section 2 , the model of double inflation will be presented .",
    "section 3 will be devoted to the analysis of adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations : their definition , how they are obtained from the inflation perturbations , the conditions to obtain correlated mixtures .",
    "section 4 considers formally the definition of spectra for the perturbations as well as the notion of correlation . in section 5 ,",
    "the predictions for the cmbr anisotropies and matter power spectrum are given for the models with correlated primordial perturbations .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , inflation needs at least two scalar fields to produce isocurvature perturbations .",
    "that is why we investigate the simplest model of inflation with two scalar fields : they are non - interacting , massive , minimally coupled scalar fields .",
    "the lagrangian corresponding to this model is @xmath0 where the subscripts @xmath1 and @xmath2 designate respectively the light and heavy scalar fields ( and thus @xmath3 ) .",
    "@xmath4 is the scalar spacetime curvature and g newton s constant .      in a spatially flat friedmann - lema^ itre - robertson - walker ( flrw )",
    "spacetime , with metric @xmath5 , the equations of motion read @xmath6 following @xcite it is convenient , during the phase when both scalar fields are slow - rolling ( i.e. when @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be neglected in ( [ 2a ] ) , @xmath9 and @xmath10 in ( [ eom ] ) ) , to write the evolution of the two scalar fields in the following parametric form @xmath11 where s=-(a / a_e ) is the number of e - folds between a given instant and the end of inflation .",
    "this form ( [ 3 ] ) is a consequence of the approximate relation @xmath12 resulting from the ( slow - roll ) equations of motion .",
    "the angular variable @xmath13 can then be related to the parameter @xmath14 by the expression @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ratio of the masses of the two scalar fields r. [ 5 ] the equation ( [ stheta ] ) was obtained by integrating the relation giving @xmath17 as a function of @xmath13 , which can be established by use of the slow - roll approximation of the equations of motion ( [ 2a])-([eom ] ) ( see @xcite for the details of the calculations ) . as noticed in @xcite , equation ( [ stheta ] )",
    "can be approximated , when @xmath18 , by the simple formula s. [ 5bis ] this behaviour corresponds to the period when inflation is dominated by the heavy scalar field ( this approximation is valid as long as @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "this period ends when @xmath21 , @xmath22 and is followed ( possibly after a dust - like transition period ) by a phase of inflation dominated by the light scalar field .",
    "it follows from ( [ 2a])-([3 ] ) that the hubble parameter can be expressed in the form @xmath23 , \\label{6}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath24 is obtained by inverting ( [ stheta ] ) ( @xmath25 ) . as inflation proceeds , @xmath14 decreases and @xmath13 goes to smaller and smaller values , which implies a decreasing hubble parameter during inflation",
    ".    it will be convenient to define @xmath26 as the number of e - folds before the end of inflation when the scale corresponding to our hubble radius today crossed out the hubble radius during inflation .",
    "the value of @xmath26 depends on the temperature after the reheating ( see e.g. @xcite ) but roughly @xmath27 . to make definite calculations",
    ", we shall take throughout this work the value s_h=60 .",
    "note that the class of models considered here depends on three free parameters : the two masses @xmath28 and @xmath29 , or alternatively @xmath28 and @xmath16 , and the parameter @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , the choice of this last parameter @xmath30 relatively to @xmath26 will determine the specific phase of double inflation , ` heavy ' dominated , intermediate or ` light ' dominated , during which the perturbations on scales of cosmological relevance were produced .",
    "after having determined the evolution of the background quantities , let us turn now to the evolution of the linear perturbations .",
    "we shall restrict our analysis to the so - called scalar perturbations ( in the terminology of bardeen @xcite ) .",
    "we thus consider a spacetime linearly perturbed about the flat flrw spacetime of the previous subsection , endowed with the metric @xmath31 although this metric is not the most general a priori , it turns out that any perturbed metric ( of the scalar type ) can be transformed into a metric of this form by a suitable coordinate transformation .",
    "this choice corresponds to the so - called longitudinal gauge .",
    "in addition to the geometrical perturbations @xmath32 and @xmath33 , one must also consider the matter perturbations , which will simply be during inflation the perturbations of the scalar fields , respectively @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with respect to their homogeneous values .    before writing down the equations of motion for the perturbations , it is convenient to use a fourier decomposition and to define the fourier modes of any perturbed quantity @xmath36 by the relation @xmath37 the equations of motion for the perturbations are derived from the perturbed einstein equations and from the klein - gordon equations of the scalar fields .",
    "they lead to the following four equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) = , @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 where the subscript @xmath41 is here implicit , as it will be throughout this paper .    in the slow - rolling approximation and for superhorizon modes , i.e. @xmath42 , these equations can be solved ( see @xcite ) and the dominant solutions read @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are time - independent constants of integration and are fixed by the initial conditions . as usual in inflation , perturbations are assumed to be initially ( i.e. before crossing out the hubble radius ) in their vacuum quantum state .",
    "perturbations outside the hubble radius are then obtained by amplification of the vacuum quantum fluctuations due to the gravitational interaction .",
    "the two scalar fields being independent , one simply duplicates the results of single scalar field inflation ( see e.g. @xcite ) . consequently , @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be written , for wavelengths crossing out the hubble radius , as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are classical gaussian random fields with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , for @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the hubble parameter when the mode crosses the hubble radius , i.e. , when @xmath54 . neglecting the evolution of the hubble parameter with respect to that of the scale factor ,",
    "the number of e - folds @xmath55 corresponding to the instant when the mode of wavenumber @xmath56 crossed out the hubble radius , is given simply by kk_h e^s_h - s_k , [ 17 ] where @xmath57 is the wavenumber corresponding to the present hubble scale .",
    "in the present work , our interest will focus on the scales of cosmological relevance , typically @xmath58 .",
    "this means that the range of e - folds that will interest us is @xmath59 .",
    "the analysis of the solutions for the perturbations during inflation obtained in the previous section will now enable us to determine the  initial \" ( but post - inflationary ) conditions for the perturbations in the radiation era taking place after inflation and reheating .      at some past instant deep in the radiation era , we shall consider four species of particles .",
    "two species will be relativistic : photons and neutrinos ; two species will be non - relativistic : baryons and cold dark matter .",
    "their respective energy density contrasts will be denoted @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) .    at this point , it is useful to define precisely the notion of adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations .",
    "isocurvature pertubations are defined by the condition that there is no perturbation of the energy density in the total comoving gauge ( denoted by the subscript @xmath65 ) , i.e. _ a ^(c)_a=0 , but that there are perturbations in the ratios of species particle numbers , i.e. ( n_a / n_b)0 in general . by contrast , adiabatic ( or isentropic ) perturbations are defined by the prescription that the particle number ratios between various species is fixed , i.e. ( n_a / n_b)= 0 , whereas the total energy density perturbation can fluctuate , i.e. _ a ^(c)_a0 .",
    "it is clear from the above definitions that , if one considers n species , there will be in general one adiabatic mode and @xmath66 isocurvature modes . here",
    ", it will be assumed that the light scalar field @xmath67 decays into ordinary particles , i.e. gives birth to the photons , neutrinos and baryons , while the dark matter particles are associated exclusively with the heavy scalar field @xmath68 .",
    "note that part of the dark matter could be also produced by the light scalar field but we shall ignore this possiblity here for simplicity . as a consequence ,",
    "the particle number ratios between the three ` ordinary ' species will be frozen , i.e. = n_n_=n_bn_b , and only one isocurvature mode will exist , which can be conveniently represented by the quantity s - n_n_= _ c-34_. [ 23 ]    going back to the longitudinal gauge , and following ma and bertschinger @xcite , one can write the initial conditions deep in the radiation era for modes outside the hubble radius in the form @xmath69 with @xmath70 and where @xmath13 stands for the divergence of the fluid three - velocity , @xmath71 for the shear stress of neutrinos ( in the rest of this paper , the contribution of neutrinos in all analytical calculations will be ignored for simplicity but it will be taken into account in the numerical calculations ) and @xmath72 is the conformal time defined by @xmath73 .",
    "all the information about the initial conditions is thus contained in the two k - dependent quantities @xmath32 and @xmath74 , which are time - independent during the radiation era ( for @xmath42 ) .",
    "the next subsections will be devoted to make the link between these two quantities and the perturbations during inflation .",
    "the evolution of @xmath32 is given by ( [ 14 ] ) only during the phase when both scalar fields are slow rolling .",
    "as soon as the heavy scalar field @xmath68 ends its slow - rolling phase , the second term on the right hand side of ( [ 14 ] ) will die out , and @xmath32 can be given during all the subsequent evolution of the universe in the simple form = c_1(1-ha_0^t a(t ) dt ) .",
    "[ 25a ] it can be checked that , during inflation , @xmath75 , which ensures that the coefficient @xmath76 in the above formula is the same as in ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "it is thus essential to express @xmath76 in terms of the perturbations of the two scalar fields , and therefore in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath48 , in order to be able to determine the amplitude of the perturbations after the end of inflation . combining the two equations in ( [ 15 ] ) and using ( [ 16 ] ) , as well as the slow - roll approximation of the background equations of motion ( [ 2a])-([eom ] ) , the expression for the coefficient @xmath76 during inflation",
    "is found to be c_1()-4gh_k . as it is clear from this formula",
    ", @xmath77 is a stochastic variable , whose properties can be determined from the stochastic properties of @xmath49 and @xmath48 .    during the radiation era , the relation between the coefficient @xmath76 and the gravitational potential is simply , using once more ( [ 25a ] ) , = 23 c_1 ( ) .",
    "therefore , the gravitational potential during the radiation era for modes larger than the hubble scale is given by the expression @xcite -43k^-3/2 h_k , [ 27 ] where @xmath53 is given as a function of @xmath55 in ( [ 6 ] ) and @xmath55 is given as a function of @xmath56 in ( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "the hat in the above equations ( and in all subsequent equations ) indicates that the value of the corresponding quantity is taken deep in the radiation era when the wavelength of the fourier mode is larger than the hubble radius .",
    "as explained in subsection a , the isocurvature perturbations in the present model are due to variations in the relative proportions of cold dark matter , generated by the heavy scalar field , with respect to the three other main species ( photons , baryons , neutrinos ) , all generated by the light scalar field .",
    "moreover , during the radiation era , the isocurvature perturbation @xmath74 rigorously defined by ( [ 23 ] ) is essentially the comoving cold dark matter density contrast , @xmath78 , so that what is needed to obtain the primordial isocurvature spectrum is simply to compute the cold dark matter density contrast in terms of the scalar field perturbations during inflation .",
    "this task was carried out in @xcite .",
    "only the main points will be summarized here .",
    "let us first give the comoving energy density perturbation associated with the heavy scalar field : _",
    "h^(c)=_h_h+m_h^2_h_h+ 3h_h_h-_h^2 .",
    "[ 28 ] matching the inflationary phase when @xmath68 is slow - rolling to the the inflationary phase when @xmath68 is oscillating and then to the post - reheating radiation dominated phase , one finds @xcite _ h^(c)-43m_h^2c_3 . [ 29 ]    the coefficient @xmath79 can then be obtained , during inflation , by substracting the two equations in ( [ 15 ] ) and then using the ( slow - roll ) background equations of motion and ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "inserting the result in ( [ 29 ] ) , the density contrast of the cold dark matter ( associated with the heavy scalar field ) , for modes larger than the hubble radius , is found to be given , during the radiation era , by the expression _",
    "h^(c)h_k(_h^-1 e_h()-m_h^2m_l^2 _ l^-1 e_l ( ) ) , where the value of the scalar fields is taken at hubble radius crossing .",
    "this can be reexpressed , using ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) , in the form s_h^(c ) 2k^-3/2s_k^-1/2h_k .",
    "[ 31 ] note that the isocurvature perturbations have the same power - law dependence as the adiabatic perturbations multiplied by a weakly k - dependent expression which is different from the analogous expression in ( [ 27 ] ) .",
    "as shown above , the quantities describing the primordial adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations are in general linear combinations of the independent stochastic quantities @xmath49 and @xmath48 and are thus expected to be correlated .",
    "it is now necessary to examine the actual value of the corresponding coefficients . for adiabatic perturbations , i.e. in equation ( [ 27 ] ) , the light contribution is dominant for @xmath80 whereas the heavy contribution is dominant for @xmath81 . for isocurvature perturbations ,",
    "i.e. in equation ( [ 31 ] ) , the light contribution dominates for @xmath82 whereas the heavy contribution is predominant in the opposite case . assuming @xmath83",
    ", one can thus divide the space of parameters for double inflation into three regions :      the adiabatic perturbations are dominated by the heavy scalar field while the isocurvature perturbations are dominated by the light scalar field .",
    "the two types of perturbations will thus appear independent . moreover , except for @xmath13 very close to @xmath85 , the isocurvature amplitude will be suppressed with respect to the adiabatic amplitude by a factor @xmath55 . in this parameter region , one recovers the standard results of a pure adiabatic spectrum due to a single scalar field , here the heavy scalar field .      in this region",
    ", essentially only the light scalar field contributes to the adiabatic perturbations while the isocurvature perturbations are dominated by the heavy scalar field .",
    "the two contributions are therefore independent and the isocurvature amplitude can be very high with respect to the adiabatic one if @xmath13 is sufficiently small .",
    "this is the most interesting region . here",
    ", both the adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations are essentially feeded by the fluctuations of the light scalar field ( even if their amplitude depends on the background value of the two scalar fields ) .",
    "this means that the adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations are strongly correlated in this region .",
    "if one considers the relative magnitude of these light scalar field contributions , one sees that the isocurvature contribution can compensate the @xmath88 suppression ( with respect to the adiabatic perturbations ) by a suitable factor @xmath89 .",
    "note also that in the upper part of this parameter region , i.e. for @xmath90 , the heavy and light contributions in the adiabatic perturbations will be of similar order while the heavy contribution in the isocurvature perturbations can be ignored .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "in the lower part of the region , i.e. @xmath91 , the heavy contribution in the adiabatic perturbations is negligible whereas the light and heavy contributions in the isocurvature perturbations are of similar weight .",
    "this is illustrated on figure 1 , which displays the relative behaviour of the four contributions as a function of the angle @xmath13 .",
    "the expressions for the adiabatic and isocurvature primordial perturbations , ( [ 27 ] ) and ( [ 31 ] ) can be simplified further when one assumes that these perturbations are produced during some specific phases of inflation .",
    "for instance , if all scales of cosmological relevance are produced during the period of inflation dominated by the heavy scalar field , then the approximate relation ( [ 5bis ] ) relating the angle @xmath13 to the number of e - folds applies , which enables us to simplify the hubble parameter expression , given in equation ( [ 6 ] ) , into h(s)m_l . the various contributions to adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations",
    "then reduce to the form k^3/2_h-49m_l(s_k - s_0 ) , k^3/2_l-49m_l , and k^3/2s_hm_l , k^3/2s_l-23m_lr^2 , where the indices @xmath2 and @xmath1 refer to the corresponding coefficients of @xmath48 and @xmath49 in ( [ 27 ] ) and ( [ 31 ] ) .",
    "let us briefly comment these results when one varies the free parameters of the model , @xmath28 , @xmath16 and @xmath30 ( but remaining in the domain of validity of the above approximate expressions ) .",
    "considering the variations with respect to the first two parameters , one can notice that all the contributions are proportional to the term @xmath92 , except @xmath93 which contains an additional @xmath89 dependence .",
    "this means , ignoring for the moment the ( weak ) scale dependence , that the relative amplitudes of three of the contributions are fixed , the relative amplitude of @xmath93 being adjustable by the mass ratio @xmath16 .",
    "once @xmath16 is fixed , the overall amplitude of the perturbations can be fixed by the scale @xmath28 .",
    "concerning now the variation of the contributions with the cosmological scale , @xmath94 is scale - invariant , while the three other are weakly scale dependent : @xmath95 and @xmath93 have the same dependence , whereas @xmath96 has a stronger dependence .",
    "another limiting case corresponds to @xmath97 , which occurs during the period of inflation dominated by the light scalar field . in this case , one has @xmath98 and the hubble parameter is approximately given by h(s)m_l . as a consequence ,",
    "the heavy and light contributions are approximated by k^3/2_h-49m_l s_k _ k , k^3/2_l-49m_l s_k for the adiabatic perturbations and k^3/2s_hm_l_k^-1 , k^3/2s_l-23m_lr^2 for isocurvature perturbations .",
    "the heavy adiabatic contribution is thus negligible and the perturbations due to the heavy scalar field are therefore essentially isocurvature .",
    "note , to conclude this section , that in their work @xcite , polarski and starobinsky , concentrated their attention on the intermediate case where the scales of cosmological relevance just correspond to the transition zone from the heavy scalar field driven inflation to the light scalar field driven inflation . as a consequence ,",
    "their spectrum has a stronger variation in @xmath56 than in the limiting cases considered above . here , the emphasis is put on contributions to the isocurvature perturbations . with another choice of parameters",
    ", one can also produce a huge temperature anisotropy dipole due to isocurvature perturbations on scales larger than the present hubble radius @xcite .",
    "it is usually assumed in cosmology that the perturbations can be described by ( homogeneous and isotropic ) gaussian random fields . in the specific model under consideration here , where the perturbations are created during an inflationary phase ,",
    "this is true by construction .",
    "what is new here is that isocurvature and adiabatic perturbations are not assumed to be independent . indeed , as shown in the previous section , in the case of double inflation , the two kinds of perturbations are correlated , at least for some region of the parameter space .",
    "it will thus be our purpose to define statistical quantities that can describe random fields which are , a priori , correlated .",
    "let us first recall , for any homogeneous and isotropic random field @xmath36 , the standard definition ( up to a normalization factor ) of its power spectrum by the expression @xmath99 in addition to this definition , it will be useful to define a covariance spectrum between two random fields @xmath36 and @xmath100 by the following expression @xmath101 in order to estimate the degree of correlation between two quantities , it is convenient to also define the correlation spectrum @xmath102 by normalizing @xmath103 : _ f , g(k)=c_f , g(k ) .",
    "[ 44 ] schwartz inequality implies , as usual , that @xmath104 .",
    "the correlation ( anticorrelation ) will be stronger as one is closer to @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "let us now specialize the above formulas to the case of perturbations generated by double inflation . by substituting the explicit expressions for the perturbations obtained in the previous section , namely ( [ 27 ] ) and ( [ 31 ] ) , one finds _",

    "s=2gh_k^2s_k , for the initial isocurvature spectrum and _ , s=4 g3h_k^2(r^2 - 1 ) for the covariance spectrum . combining the three above spectra according to ( [ 44 ] )",
    ", one finds finally for the correlation spectrum the expression _ , s=(r^2 - 1)2(r^4 ^2+^2)^1/2 .",
    "it is instructive to study the dependence of this correlation spectrum with respect to the parameters of the model .",
    "if one takes @xmath13 fixed , one sees that the correlation will vanish for @xmath107 and will then increase monotonously with increasing @xmath16 approaching the asymptotic value @xmath108 .",
    "if now one considers @xmath16 as fixed and study the variations of the correlation with respect to @xmath13 , one recovers the conclusions of section 3d : the correlation vanishes when @xmath13 approaches zero or @xmath85 ; inbetween , one can see that the correlation reach a maximum for @xmath109 , with the value _",
    ", s^max = r^2 - 1r^2 + 1 .",
    "the correlation spectrum @xmath110 for various choices of parameters has been plotted on fig .",
    "2 , as a function of @xmath55 . one can , as before , distinguish between the two extreme cases . for models such that @xmath18 , corresponding to a heavy inflationary phase , the various contributions vary slowly with @xmath13 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "this means that the correlation will be almost constant . for models such that @xmath111 , corresponding to a light inflationary phase , @xmath94 increases quickly with decreasing @xmath13 , i.e. with decreasing scales , which implies that the correlation will decrease with decreasing scales , i.e. smaller @xmath55 .",
    "the models with @xmath112 belong to the first category , while models with @xmath113 correspond to the second . finally , the models with @xmath30 close to @xmath26 have an intermediate behaviour between the two extreme cases",
    ". they also have the strongest correlation .",
    "in the case of perturbations whose wavelength is larger than the hubble radius , the time evolution is particularly simple . for an initial isocurvature perturbation characterized by the initial amplitude @xmath114 , the entropy perturbation @xmath74 is unchanged as long as the perturbation is larger than the hubble radius , whatever the evolution of the backgroung equation of state , i.e. s = s ( kah ) .",
    "[ 51 ] however , the radiation - matter transition will generate a gravitational potential perturbation ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath115 of course , the initial adiabatic perturbation will also contribute to the gravitational potential perturbation : ^ad = t(kah),[53 ] where @xmath116 is a coefficient , close to @xmath105 , due to the evolution of the universe ( if one ignores the anisotropic stress of the neutrinos , @xmath117 . )      at large angular scales , the temperature anisotropies are essentially due to the sum of an intrinsic contribution and of a sachs - wolfe @xcite contribution .",
    "except for the dipole for which the doppler terms are important , the sachs - wolfe contribution can be written ( for a spatially flat background ) @xmath118    where @xmath119 on the left hand side is a unit vector corresponding to the direction of observation and @xmath120 on the right hand side represents the intersection of the last scattering surface with the light - ray of direction @xmath119 .",
    "the intrinsic contribution is simply given , via the stefan law , as the perturbation @xmath121 at the time of last scattering .",
    "since last scattering occured in the matter era , @xmath122 , and therefore for an adiabatic perturbation ( @xmath123 ) , @xmath124 , which can be seen to be negligible ( see below ( [ poisson ] ) ) with respect to the sachs - wolfe contribution , whereas for an isocurvature perturbation ( @xmath125 during matter era ) , @xmath126 to conclude , the temperature anisotropies will be given in general by @xmath127 on angular scales larger than the angle ( of the order of the degree ) corresponding to the size of the hubble radius at the time of the last scattering .",
    "this equation enables us to estimate easily the normalization of the temperatures anisotropies for the low multipoles ( see the definition ( [ 62])-([63 ] ) ) , essentially constrained by cobe measurements .",
    "note that for mixed primordial perturbations with isocurvature and adiabatic contributions of the same order of magnitude , the low multipoles anisotropies can be significantly reduced by a compensation effect between the isocurvature perturbation and the adiabatic one .",

    "large scale structure is governed by the density contrast , or equivalently the gravitational potential perturbation @xmath32 since the latter quantity can be related to the ( total ) contrast density in the comoving gauge by the ( generalized ) poisson equation , which reads ( see e.g. @xcite ) ( ka h)^2=-32 .",
    "[ poisson ] for modes inside the hubble radius the evolution becomes quite complicated and depends on the specific ingredients of the model .",
    "but what is relevant for our purpose is that this subhorizon evolution does not depend on the nature of the primordial perturbations . what matters is the total gravitational potential perturbation @xmath32 which can be written , in the matter era , as @xmath129 note that the influence of primordial isocurvature perturbations is smaller on the large scale density power spectrum ( see ( [ 57 ] ) ) than on large scale temperature anisotropies ( see ( [ 56 ] ) ) .      using the relation ( [ 56 ] )",
    "( with @xmath130 ) , the spectrum for the large scale temperature anisotropies can be expressed in terms of the primordial isocurvature and adiabatic spectra , @xmath131 when only primordial adiabatic perturbations are present , the previous expression implies @xmath132 whereas for pure isocurvature perturbations , one finds @xmath133 this is in agreement with the standard comment in the literature that isocurvature perturbations generate cmbr anisotropies six times bigger than equivalent adiabatic perturbations .",
    "this is the reason why isocurvature perturbations are in general rejected in comological models @xcite .",
    "however , when one takes into account both isocurvature and adiabatic perturbations , with the possibility of correlation , then the additional term due to correlation can change significantly these conclusions .",
    "illustrations will be given in the next subsection .",
    "similarly , the spectrum for the gravitational potential is given by @xmath134      after having considered long wavelength perturbations , whose advantage is one can estimate analytically their observable amplitude and thus normalize easily the models , let us analyze now smaller scales , which require the use of numerical computation .",
    "as it is customary , one decomposes the cmbr anisotropies on the basis of spherical harmonics : @xmath135 the predictions of a model are usually given in terms of the expectation values of the squared multipole coefficients c_l|a_lm|^2 . [ 63 ] in the present model , the temperature anisotropies will be the superposition of a contribution due to the heavy scalar field and of a contribution due to the light scalar field .",
    "these two contributions are independent , because the stochastic quantities @xmath48 and @xmath49 are independent , and as such the coefficients @xmath136 can be decomposed c_l = c_l^(l ) + c_l^(h ) , where the upper index refers to the light or heavy nature of the perturbations .",
    "it is important to emphasize that only a decomposition of this type is allowed here .",
    "for example , a decomposition of the @xmath136 as a sum of an isocurvature contribution and of an adiabatic contribution would be wrong here . in practice ,",
    "the heavy and light contributions to the @xmath136 are computed independently , by using twice a boltzmann code ( developped in our group by a. riazuelo , and used in @xcite ) .",
    "the first run takes as initial condition @xmath96 and @xmath94 and yields the coefficients @xmath137 .",
    "similarly , the second run computes the @xmath138 using as initial conditions the corresponding quantities @xmath95 and @xmath93 . the results for @xmath138 and @xmath137 , as well as their sum @xmath136 , are plotted on fig . 3 - 6 for four illustrative models",
    "( for all models the hubble parameter and the baryon density correspond respectively to @xmath139 , @xmath140 ) .",
    "for the first three models , the value @xmath141 has been chosen because the isocurvature and adiabatic contributions of the light scalar field are then of similar amplitude , as is visible on fig . 1 , and the effects of mixing and correlation are particularly important .",
    "a consequence of the similar amplitude ( with the same sign ) of the two ` light ' contributions is an important suppression of the light spectrum @xmath138 for small @xmath1 , as noticed already in the previous subsection , and as is visible on fig 3 - 5 . in contrast",
    ", one can check on fig . 6",
    "that this will not be the case for the @xmath142 model , for which @xmath93 is dominant .",
    "the first two graphs have a roughly similar behaviour for the heavy contribution .",
    "what distinguishes them is the light contribution , which illustrates its high sensitivity on the relative amplitudes of @xmath93 and @xmath95 .",
    "a systematic investigation of the effects of mixed correlated primordial spectra , independently of the early universe model to produce them , on the temperature anisotropies will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "for these two models , one notices an amplification ( weak in the first case and strong in the second ) of the main acoustic peak with respect to the standard ( pure adiabatic and scale - invariant ) model .",
    "in contrast , the third example shows a suppression of the main peak , which is due to a strong contribution @xmath94 , which makes the heavy spectrum look  isocurvature `` and thus damps the main peak in the global spectrum . finally , the last example is characteristic of the domination of the ` light ' spectrum , itself dominated by the isocurvature contribution ( @xmath93 ) , which thus makes the global spectrum look ' ' isocurvature \" .",
    "it is rather remarkable that modest variations of the two relevant parameters of the model , @xmath16 and @xmath30 ( @xmath28 is useful simply for an overall normalization of the parameters ) , can lead to a large variety of temperature anisotropy spectra .",
    "another quantity which is extremely important for the confrontation of models with the observations is the ( total ) density power spectrum . in the literature",
    ", it is usually denoted @xmath143 and its relation to the corresponding spectrum @xmath144 ( for the comoving density constrast ) defined generically in ( [ 42 ] ) is p(k)=2 ^ 2k^-3p_. using the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) , it can be reexpressed in terms of the gravitational potential spectrum p(k)=8 ^ 29(a_0h_0)^4k p_(k ) .    as with the temperature anisotropies , the power spectrum for double inflation is obtainable by computing independently the power spectrum for the heavy scalar field contribution , then that for the light scalar field contribution , and finally by adding the two results , p(k)=p_l(k ) + p_h(k ) .",
    "in contrast with the temperature anisotropies , the influence of the mixing and correlation of the primordial perturbations on the density spectrum is less spectacular because the shapes of the pure isocurvature and pure adiabatic density spectra are not extremely different .",
    "there is however a sensible difference : the pure isocurvature spectrum has , relatively to the large scales , less power on small scales than the pure adiabatic spectrum . to illustrate what happens for mixed and correlated primordial perturbations , fig .",
    "7 displays , for the model specified by the parameters @xmath141 and @xmath145 , the total power spectrum , together with the two independent ` light ' and ` heavy ' contributions , as well as the standard adiabatic cdm power spectrum ( normalized as before ) for comparison .",
    "note that the resulting spectrum has , relatively to large scales , less power than the standard adiabatic power spectrum .",
    "however , it has globally more power than the standard spectrum for the same temperature anisotropy amplitude on small @xmath1 .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that it is possible , in the simplest model of multiple inflation , to obtain correlated isocurvature and adiabatic primordial perturbations .",
    "these perturbations slightly deviate from scale - invariance but their correlation can entail significant modifications with respect to standard single scalar field models .    this class of models , both simple and rich , could provide an interesting field of experiment to investigate the feasibility to determine the cosmological parameters and the primordial perturbations from expected data",
    ". the question would be , assuming nature has chosen this particular model , could we infer from the expected temperature anisotropy data the cosmological parameters and to which precision ?",
    "more important , would it possible to discriminate between a single field inflation model and a multiple field model with correlated perturbations and what would be the price to pay on the precision of the cosmological parameters ?",
    "it was not the purpose of the present work to exhibit a model supposed to fit better the observations .",
    "however , one of these models , surprisingly , turns out to present two characteristics , which are at present favoured by observations : a power spectrum with modest power at small scales ( comparatively to the standard cdm model ) and a high peak on intermediate scales .",
    "it may be worth seeing how well this model does when confronted with the current observations .    finally , it would be interesting to investigate the possiblity of correlated adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations within the framework of multiple inflation with interaction between scalar fields and see how the main features presented here would be modified .",
