    "the basic features of the soft hadron production , such as the transverse - momentum spectra and the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath0 , are successfully described by the hydrodynamic models @xcite , for recent reviews see @xcite . in this paper , encouraged by the success of this framework",
    ", we use the newly developed hydrodynamic approach @xcite linked to the statistical - hadronization monte - carlo model therminator @xcite to globally describe the soft hadron production at the highest rhic energies and to make predictions for the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the distinctive features of our approach are the following : 1 ) the realistic equation of state is used which interpolates smoothly between the lattice results @xcite and the hadron gas model . in this way a cross - over phase transition is included in the dynamics of the system .",
    "2 ) the statistical hadronization monte - carlo model @xcite is applied to describe hadron production and resonance decays .",
    "the use of the full set of hadronic resonances allows to incorporate a relatively high freeze - out temperature , @xmath1 150 mev , which helps to describe the magnitude of the hbt radii .",
    "3 ) the two - particle method including coulomb effects is used to calculate the correlation functions .",
    "this method mimics , as closely as possible , the procedures used in the experimental measurements .",
    "the drawback of our approach is that we do not include the elastic rescattering in the final state ( after the chemical freeze - out ) . as may be concluded from the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite such effects are small for pions . on the other hand",
    ", they are more important for protons and may be responsible for differences betweeen the model results and the data in this case .",
    "studying the hadron production at the highest rhic energies , we make an attempt to describe consistently not only the transverse - momentum spectra and the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath0 but also the hbt correlation radii .",
    "we find that a global fit to pion and kaon observables is possible at the level of 10 - 15% , which we find quite satisfactory , having in mind systematic uncertainties in various elements of the approach .    by means of simple extrapolations to higher energies ( i.e. , increasing the total inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section , initial temperature , and the contributions from hard scattering to the initial entropy ) we make predictions for soft hadronic observables at lhc .",
    "we note that the similar predictions of other hydrodynamic models for phenomena expected at the lhc have been recently presented and summarized in ref .",
    "the hydrodynamic evolution starts at the proper time @xmath2 = 1 fm .",
    "we assume that there is no initial transverse flow formed at this moment .",
    "the initial entropy density profile in the transverse plane is proportional to the linear combination of the wounded - nucleon density and the density of binary collisions , namely @xmath3 the case @xmath4 corresponds to the standard wounded - nucleon model @xcite , while @xmath5 would include the binary collisions only .",
    "the phobos analysis @xcite of the particle multiplicities yields @xmath6 at @xmath7 and @xmath8 at @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we assume @xmath10 for rhic and @xmath11 for lhc .    the wounded - nucleon and the binary - collisions densities in eq .  ( [ initialeps2 ] )",
    "are obtained from the optical limit of the glauber model , which is a very good approximation for not too peripheral collisions @xcite . in the calculations of those densities we use two values of the nucleon - nucleon",
    "total inelastic cross section : @xmath12 for rhic and @xmath13 for lhc .",
    "different values of the nucleon - nucleon cross section imply different relations between the centrality classes and the impact parameters . in this paper",
    "we restrict our presentation to the discussion of the centrality class @xmath14 = 20 - 30% and use the values : for rhic and @xmath15 = 7.60 fm for lhc .",
    "we note that different nuclear density profiles are used for rhic ( gold on gold collisions ) and lhc ( lead on lead collisions ) .",
    "the overall normalization of the entropy density is determined by the value of the initial central temperature @xmath16 .",
    "this parameter controls mainly the absolute yields of the particles . from the fits to the rhic data we find @xmath16 = 320 mev .",
    "we expect that a higher initial temperature will be achieved at lhc , hence we use @xmath16 = 450 mev in this case .",
    "the other possible values of the initial temperature at lhc , as well as other centralities , were analyzed thoroughly in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the input parameters for the rhic and lhc calculations are summarized in table  [ tab : rhiclhc ] .",
    "we note that the initial conditions for hydrodynamics used in this paper may be regarded as the standard approach .",
    "very recently , we have found that the departure from such a standard form , i.e. , the use of the gaussian energy profiles with width parameters obtained from glissando @xcite , leads to even better description of the rhic data @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite in this context ) .",

    "this picture may be still improved by imposing different initial conditions , as argued in ref .",
