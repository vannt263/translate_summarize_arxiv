    "one of the big unknowns in astroparticle physics today is the absolute neutrino mass scale @xmath4 .",
    "while indirect probes such as cosmology  @xcite and neutrinoless double @xmath3 decay  @xcite achieve sub - ev sensitivity to @xmath4 , it is desirable to complement these measurements with model - independent direct bounds .",
    "the most advanced efforts in this direction have been the kinematical studies of the @xmath3 spectrum in tritium decay by the mainz  @xcite and troitsk  @xcite collaborations , yielding the limit @xmath5  ev . in the near future",
    ", the sensitivity will be improved to @xmath6  ev by the katrin experiment  @xcite .",
    "however , mainz , troitsk , and katrin are limited by the accuracy to which the spectrum of decay electrons can be measured few ev below the kinematical endpoint , where the impact of @xmath7 is largest .",
    "since the kinetic energy release ( @xmath0 value ) of tritium decay is @xmath8  kev , only a very small fraction of decays falls into that region so that large statistics , very good background suppression , and an excellent energy resolution are required .",
    "if katrin should not see a positive signal , new experimental techniques would be required to push the sensitivity to even smaller @xmath4 .",
    "for example , it has been proposed to study nuclear recoils in bound state @xmath3 decay of tritium  @xcite , to reconstruct the electron and nuclear kinematics in tritium decay  @xcite , or to measure the electron flux near the tritium endpoint in a storage ring  @xcite .",
    "however , all of these proposals are limited by the large @xmath0 value of tritium , which makes the neutrino mass a small effect . the decay",
    "@xmath9 offers a lower @xmath0 value of only @xmath10  kev and thus better sensitivity to @xmath4 , but since it is a unique first forbidden decay , the small decay rate makes it difficult to accumulate sufficient statistics  @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate weak decays with even smaller @xmath0 values .",
    "in particular , we consider continuum @xmath3 ( @xmath11 ) , bound state @xmath3 ( @xmath12 ) , and electron capture ( ec ) decays .",
    "the key ideas are to consider decays to _ excited _ nuclear daughter states and to use _ ions _ instead of neutral atoms if necessary . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : qvalues ] , an appropriate choice of the ionization level allows for some tuning of the @xmath0 value since every spectator electron contributes to @xmath0 with its energy gain or loss due to the change of the nuclear charge during the decay . for @xmath12 decay  @xcite",
    ", ionization can also have the direct effect of opening up new decay modes .",
    "our aim is to find decays that have sufficiently small @xmath0 values to depend appreciably on @xmath4 , but at the same time still have an absolute rate large enough to allow for a good signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "note that energy levels in the decay @xmath13 shown here have an uncertainty of @xmath14 , so the figure is to be understood as an illustration of the principle idea only.,width=340 ]    for @xmath12 and ec decay , the observable sensitive to @xmath4 is the decay rate , which could be measured by detecting gamma and x - ray photons accompanying the decay . in the case of @xmath11 decay , the sensitivity can be increased by guiding the decay electrons into a spectrometer similar to the ones used in mainz , troitsk , and katrin in order to also measure the @xmath3 spectrum near the endpoint . for those decays where ionization is required to achieve sufficiently low @xmath0",
    ", we propose to store the parent ions in a trap or in a storage ring .",
    "we discuss the feasibility of these ideas below .",
    "nuclear decays with an ultra - small kinetic energy release @xmath15  kev can occur only if the daughter nucleus has a state with excitation energy @xmath16 fulfilling @xmath17 here , we have neglected contributions from the @xmath18 binding energies of outer shell electrons .",
    "@xmath19 refers to the atomic mass difference of the parent and daughter nuclei , while we reserve that notation for the actual kinetic energy release in a decay , which is the quantity that determines the sensitivity to @xmath4 . ] and @xmath20 is the modulus of the total electron binding energy in an atom or ion with nuclear charge @xmath21 and @xmath22 orbital electrons . in the first equation , @xmath23 is the energy gain of the spectator electrons in the decay of a neutral atom . by ionization",
    ", the effective @xmath0 value can be reduced by up to that amount . in @xmath24  decay ,",
    "ionization can also increase @xmath0 by opening up decay modes to low - lying bound states .",
    "the maximum possible increase occurs for @xmath24  decay of a hydrogen - like ion into a helium - like daughter state , and is consequently of @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath26 decay , @xmath0 can be increased compared to @xmath27 , the value for neutral atoms , by removing spectator electrons and thus avoiding an energy loss of up to @xmath28 . for ec , @xmath0 can be smaller than the atomic mass difference @xmath19 by up to the binding energy of the @xmath29 electrons , which is of @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath0 can not be made significantly larger than @xmath19 for ec .",
    "we list several candidate isotopes for low-@xmath0 @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and ec decay in table  [ tab : isotopes ] . since nuclear structure data is still very incomplete for many isotopes , it is quite possible that other suitable decays will be identified in the future . to keep the expected signal - to - background ratio large ,",
    "we have only considered isotopes for which a low-@xmath0 decay is allowed from spin and parity arguments , while other decay modes ( if present ) are at least first forbidden or otherwise have a very small branching ratio .",
    "note that , for some of our candidate isotopes , decay into the relevant excited daughter state @xmath33 has not been observed yet , so even though it is not forbidden by spin and parity arguments we can not be sure that it exists . for each decay",
    "we have computed @xmath0 as a function of the electron configuration .",
    "the main uncertainties in this calculation come from the atomic mass differences @xmath19 , which are typically known to @xmath34  @xcite , and from the binding energies of multi - electron configurations .",
    "we have estimated these binding energies using ( i ) the relativistic hartree - fock code atsp2k  @xcite and ( ii ) published atomic physics data and simulation results  @xcite ( we only report the results of method ( ii ) ) .",
    "the good agreement between the two independent estimates ( i ) and ( ii ) shows that the atomic physics uncertainty in our @xmath0 values is @xmath35  ev and thus smaller than the uncertainties in most @xmath19 values .",
    "an actual neutrino mass measurement would , however , require both , @xmath19 and the electron binding energies , to be known to an accuracy better than @xmath36 , and we discuss below how this could be achieved . here , we deal with the uncertainties by reporting how small @xmath0 can be made if the present best fit values for @xmath19 are taken at face value , and by how much @xmath0 can change if @xmath19 is varied within present uncertainties . in all cases ,",
    "we assume the degree of ionization and the daughter state @xmath33 to be chosen in the optimum way .    for @xmath37  decay , the most promising isotopes at present are @xmath38@xmath39 , @xmath40@xmath41 , and @xmath42@xmath43 with achievable @xmath0 values between 0 and 1.3  kev , depending on the true value of @xmath19 .",
    "a measure for the sensitivity of these low-@xmath0 @xmath37  decays to nonzero @xmath4 is the rate of events with electron energies in a small interval @xmath44 $ ] near the spectral endpoint .",
    "however , by considering the phase space factor and the coulomb correction term ( fermi function ) entering in the @xmath11 decay rate , it is easy to show that this number is _ independent _ of @xmath0 . to zeroth order , and neglecting differences in nuclear matrix elements , this seems to indicate that for achieving the same sensitivity as katrin in a low-@xmath0 experiment a similar number of stored parent atoms ( @xmath45 ) would be required , which is far beyond the capabilities of present ion traps ( @xmath46@xmath47 )  @xcite and storage rings ( @xmath48@xmath49 )  @xcite .",
    "however , the larger relative effect of @xmath4 makes a low-@xmath0 @xmath37  decay experiment more robust against many systematic errors .",
    "for instance , the required relative spectrometer resolution is smaller than in the tritium case .",
    "moreover , if the time of each decay can be tagged by observing an associated gamma or x - ray photon , the spectrometer can be operated in the more sensitive time - of - flight ( mac - e tof ) mode  @xcite .",
    "finally , it might be possible to combine our ideas with the methods proposed in  @xcite to measure also the energy and momentum of the recoil nucleus .",
    "all these effects should help to reduce the required number of stored ions , even though the experiment will still be extremely challenging .",

    "( c ) predicting the decay rate @xmath104 for @xmath24  or ec decay . *",
