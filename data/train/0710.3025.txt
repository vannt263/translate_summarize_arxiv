    "a lot of work has been devoted recently to the understanding of the peculiar magnetic behaviour of extended networks of spins on triangle or tetrahedron based lattices .",
    "these elemental configurations of spins , especially when they are corner - sharing , imply strong geometrical frustration for antiferromagnetically coupled heisenberg spins , i.e. inability to simultaneously minimize the pair interactions .",
    "the case of @xmath3=1/2 spins is especially appealing because it should enhance quantum physical behaviour .",
    "the archetypical frustrated network of spins in 2 dimensions is the kagom lattice , which is expected to stabilize , at low temperature , a spin liquid state @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking feature of this state is the presence of many low lying singlet states @xcite .",
    "this feature could be interpreted in a short - range resonating valence bond picture of the kagom ground state @xcite .",
    "few experimental realizations of kagom lattice with @xmath3=1/2 spins are available . among these",
    ", the recently studied hebertsmithite @xcite does not present any magnetic transition down to the lowest temperature but its fluctuating ground state is still under debate since it does not meet the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the theoretical studies have been undertaken on ideal systems but exact solutions can only be obtained for a limited number of spins ( up to 36 ) @xcite .",
    "this is one of the reasons why it should be interesting to study experimentally a system constituted of isolated frustrated clusters of spins , for which the exact calculations are fully relevant .",
    "the physics of spin clusters has attracted much attention by itself .",
    "quantum dynamics of mesoscopic magnets and decoherence effects by specific environments for instance can be investigated in organo - metallic molecular magnets with metal clusters stabilizing a collective spin magnetically isolated by the organic ligands .",
    "a number of investigations thus followed the discovery of a staircase magnetization hysteresis loop associated with the quantum tunneling of collective spins trough a magnetic anisotropy energy barrier @xcite .",
    "clusters with small total spin and large nel vector also raised strong interest .",
    "this is the case of the polyoxovanadate , shortnamed v@xmath6 , constituted of 15 v@xmath7 ions . its magnetic properties , showing quantum processes under sweeping field @xcite ,",
    "are accounted for by the formation of a collective pseudo - spin @xmath8=1/2 from the three weakly coupled @xmath3=1/2 spins on the central triangle of the cluster @xcite .",
    "the study of spin clusters within oxide compounds was undertaken more recently . at variance with molecular compounds ,",
    "the magnetic screening then is much less effective , which leads to non - negligible inter - cluster interactions and therefore allows the study of the coupling of the collective entities .",
    "for instance , in the oxide compound la@xmath9cu@xmath0moo@xmath10 , a trimer of @xmath3=1/2 spins is stabilized in each triangle of cu@xmath11 at the vertices of a square lattice @xcite .",
    "the inter - cluster couplings in la@xmath9cu@xmath0moo@xmath10 is two orders of magnitude smaller than the intra - cluster ones , and lead to the onset of an antiferromagnetic long - range order at 2.6 k. in both v@xmath6 and la@xmath9cu@xmath0moo@xmath10 compounds , the splitting of the 2 fundamental @xmath3=1/2 spins doublets might be attributed to a departure from the trigonal symmetry .",
    "a last remarkable oxide compound whose properties are dominated by spin clusters is na@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the clusters are built on rings of 9 antiferromagnetically interacting v@xmath7 ions of @xmath3=1/2 spins , piled up in tubes with inter - ring ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "one @xmath3=1/2 spin out of 9 is left active in the low temperature paramagnetic regime through a dimerization process of the other spins of the ring , characterized by a broad range of v - v interactions .",
    "the proximity of a quantum critical point at @xmath13=0 is suggested from the complex magnetic behaviour observed with respect to the magnetic field h at low temperature t.    the layered oxide la@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 @xcite , parent of the la@xmath9cu@xmath0moo@xmath10 compound , provides a model at the intersection of geometrical frustration and spin cluster research areas . in the magnetic layers ,",
    "the cu@xmath11 ions form planar clusters of antiferromagnetically coupled 8 and 9 @xmath3=1/2 spins , arranged on 4 corner - sharing triangles .",
    "the geometrically frustrated 9-spin cluster is very similar to the building block of a kagom network .",
    "as will be shown in the following , a collective state of spin is constructed from the @xmath3=1/2 spins wave functions of each cluster while decreasing the temperature .",
    "the resulting collective pseudo - spins involve a greater number of individual spins than in the v@xmath6 or la@xmath9cu@xmath0moo@xmath10 compounds .",
    "like in la@xmath9cu@xmath0moo@xmath10 , the inter - cluster couplings in la@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 are two orders of magnitude smaller than the intra - cluster ones , and their influence is traceable in the experimental low temperature range .",
    "moreover , the clusters themselves are arranged on a triangular lattice , which gives the opportunity to study the influence of geometrical frustration at different spatial and energy scales in the same compound .    in this article , following a preliminary report @xcite , we will focus on the individual behavior of these pseudo - spins , their interplay when inter - cluster interactions become effective will be the subject of a forthcoming paper @xcite",
    ". the synthesis and crystallography of la@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 polycrystalline sample will first be described , with special emphasis on the cu / v substitution .",
    "then , the magnetic measurements will be presented , in a wide temperature range , following the construction of the collective pseudo - spin , and also in high magnetic fields .",
    "the next two sections will respectively present the results of specific heat measurements and of inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "the last section before concluding will be devoted to a discussion of these experimental results in the light of exact calculations performed on realistic models of spins cluster .",
    "a polycrystalline la@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 sample was synthesized by a sol - gel method .",
    "the stoichiometric metallic cations were dissolved in nitric acid before being complexed by addition of edta in a controlled ph solution .",
    "this solution was polymerized and then heated at 700  @xmath14c to eliminate the organic constituents .",
    "the resulting powder was annealed during 15 days at 1010  @xmath14c .",
    "the sample was first checked to be a single phase using x - ray diffraction .",

    "la , v , cu and o atoms are represented by large green , yellow , blue and small red circles , respectively . ]",
    "neutron powder diffractograms were then recorded on the high resolution powder diffractometer d2b at the institut laue langevin with a wavelength of 1.59   using a ge monochromator ( cf .",
    "[ fig : neutrons ] ) . the absence of structural phase transition",
    "was checked from 3 to 300 k. the crystallographic description of the sample , obtained from the rietvelt analysis of the neutron diffractograms with the fullprof program @xcite , was found consistent with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite : the la@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 oxide compound crystallizes in the hexagonal p6@xmath17 space group with lattice parameters a = b=14.395(2 )  , c=10.656(2 )   at 300 k. as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] ( a ) , lao@xmath15 layers alternate with ( cu / v)o@xmath16 layers underlying the 2d structure of the compound . in these ,",
    "the cu@xmath11 ions , the only magnetic ones with a @xmath3=1/2 spin , are localized on three inequivalent sites cu(2 ) , cu(3 ) and cu(4 ) ( following the site labeling of ref . ) having different coordination environments .",
    "these are forming 9-spin planar clusters , constituted with 4 corner - sharing triangles .",
    "the clusters are centered at the vertices of a 2d triangular lattice ( cf .",
    "[ fig : struct ] ( b ) ) . within the planes ,",
    "o - coordinated v atoms are intercalated between the clusters .    a cu /",
    "v substitution , of vanadium v@xmath18 ions for copper cu@xmath11 ions , dictated by the global charge neutrality requirement that fixes the stoichiometric proportions of the different ions , occurs in the very small ratio of @xmath19 .",
    "notice nevertheless that this in average corresponds to one cu / v substitution over @xmath20 of the 9-spin planar clusters .",
    "we will detail the nature and consequence of this substitution below .    in non substituted clusters ,",
    "the neighbor cu - cu distances within the cluster range between 3.35   and 3.8  , whereas the shortest in - plane distances between the peripheral cu of the neighboring clusters is larger and equal to 4.55  . in comparison ,",
    "the distance between two adjacent ( cu / v)o@xmath16 layers is 5.3  .",
    "within the ( cu / v)o@xmath16 layers , the first neighbor @xmath3=1/2 spins of each cluster are interacting through superexchange via an intermediate o. concerning the inter - cluster magnetic interaction within one layer or between adjacent layers , possible longer superexchange paths can be effective through one or two o.    cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 powder neutron diffractogramm recorded at 3 k on d2b , the corresponding refined pattern and their difference .",
    "the refined structural parameters are presented in table [ table1 ] . ]      in order to understand the magnetic properties of the compound , it was found essential to take into account the cu / v substitution and the related modifications of the cluster structure .",
    "to get insight into the distribution of the v in the clusters , refinement of the powder neutron diffraction data at 3 k was made allowing v substitution on each copper sites , alternatively . although the fit is slightly better when the cu(2 ) site ( central triangle ) is substituted instead of cu(3 ) and cu(4 ) sites , in agreement with previous results @xcite ( see table [ table1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrons ] ) , further analysis was estimated necessary to unambiguously characterize the cu / v substitution .    using the vasp package @xcite , density functional theory ( dft ) methods applied to electronic structure calculation , based on the local - density approximation ( lda ) and projector augmented wave ( paw ) method ,",
    "were used for this purpose .",
    "the dft calculations were performed with periodic boundary conditions on one unit cell containing 130 atoms and including 2 clusters located in the two ( cu / v)o@xmath16 layers at @xmath22=1/4 and @xmath22=3/4 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     small variation of the @xmath23s on the other bonds of the 8-spin and 9-spin clusters are expected from the slight differences in their cu - o distances and cu - o - cu angles and by the different coordination environments of the cu(2 ) site on one hand and of the cu(3 ) and cu(4 ) sites on the other hand ( section [ sec : synthesis ] ) .",
    "an experimental constraint that gives some information about this distribution of @xmath23 values is the broad bump around 6 k observed in the magnetic specific heat .",
    "no magnetic contribution to the specific heat is observed below 10 k in the single-@xmath23 model .",
    "conversely , small differences , no larger than 5 % , between the three bonds of the external triangles in the 9-spin clusters allow the rise of a bump in the calculated specific heat around 6 k. note that the low energy spectrum as well as the shape of the magnetic susceptibility are much less sensitive to the value of @xmath24 ( the inner triangle exchange ) .",
    "in addition , similar variations of the @xmath25 to @xmath26 bonds in the 8-spin clusters does not yield any feature in the specific heat in this low temperature range . on this basis , a multi-@xmath23 model with @xmath25=1.0 , @xmath27=1.01 , @xmath28=1.045 , and @xmath24=1.02 in the 9-spin clusters ( cf .",
    "table [ tab : multij ] ) inferred from the specific heat , was proposed and found to also well reproduce the inverse magnetic susceptibility , as shown in figure [ fig : fitchi ] .",
    "the resulting specific heat is shown in figure [ fig : specht ] .",
    "in addition to the requested bump around 6 k , the calculation also reveals the presence of significant magnetic signal at high temperatures .",
    "this implies that the evaluation of the phonon contribution that was made section [ sec : specheat ] , assuming that there is a region where it follows the low temperature debye approximation and where the magnetic contribution is negligible , is incorrect .",
    "however , a phonon contribution of the form @xmath29 with @xmath30 , corresponding to @xmath31 , and @xmath32=1.1184 @xmath33 can be adjusted such that the remaining signal coincides with the calculated magnetic specific heat above 5 k ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : specht ] ) .",
    "the low lying energy levels obtained through such small variations of the exchange parameters on the external triangle in the 9-spin clusters are shown via the histograms of figure [ fig : energy ] .",
    "they would also be in agreement with the presence , in the neutron scattering experiment , of a magnetic inelastic signal at low temperature in the foot of the elastic peak ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : neutron ] ) .    ) in the low energy region , for the multi-@xmath23 model of table [ tab : multij ] . ]",
    "although not necessary for the matching of the calculations with the experimental data , small variations of the @xmath25 to @xmath26 exchange parameters in the 8-spin clusters are also expected to be present in the real system .",
    "the exact distribution of all the 8-spin and 9-spin clusters exchange parameters can however not be accessed unambiguously from the present data . because of the large number of adjustable parameters , the multi-@xmath23 model presented table [ tab : multij ] is thus not the only relevant , but the main features of this model , arising from the experimental constraints , are quite robust :",
    "smaller values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the 8-spin clusters with respect to all other first - neighbors parameters , and distribution of exchange parameter values of the order of less than 5 % in the 9-spin clusters .",
    "note that this model gives a satisfactory agreement with all the experimental data .",
    "the inverse magnetic susceptibility in particular is much better reproduced than in the single-@xmath23 model , except for tiny differences at low temperatures .",
    "these last discrepancies could be due to the onset of inter - cluster correlations at low t that were not included in the model .",
    "the evolution of these pseudo - spins when lowering temperature can be probed through the square of the total spin of the cluster @xmath36 .",
    "commuting with the cluster hamiltonian , @xmath36 is a good quantum number that allows to track the spin value of the entangled state in the whole investigated temperature range . in the multi-@xmath23 model , the pseudo - spins",
    "are stabilized below @xmath37 18 k for the 9-spin clusters and below @xmath37 8 k for the 8-spin clusters as shown by the constant @xmath36 values , 3/4 and 0 respectively , observed below these temperatures ( cf .",
    "inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : s2 ] ) .",
    "concerning behavior at higher temperatures , a @xmath38 expansion of the calculation in the region iii , confirms that the system can be described by a curie - weiss analysis in the temperature range @xmath39 k as done in section [ sec : collspin ] . in the intermediate temperature region",
    "ii , no plateau regime interpretable in terms of entangled spins states nor a @xmath38 behavior is observed .",
    "the variation of the magnetic susceptibility in this temperature regime ( cf .",
