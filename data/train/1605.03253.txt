    "research in 2d materials , as inspired by the development of graphene , has experienced an explosive increase in recent years due to their rather unique and exceptional properties with promising applications in electronic , photonic , energy and environmental devices .",
    "the 2d group - iv materials including silicene,@xcite germanene @xcite and stanene @xcite have been realized experimentally after graphene . for group - v elements , few - layer black phosphorus , named phosphorene ,",
    "@xcite has also been successfully fabricated by exfoliation , which exhibits prominent properties such as high carrier mobility and high on / off ratio .",
    "very recently , the novel 2d group - iii material of borophene has been fabricated successfully.@xcite beside the allotropes of single element in 2d family , the 2d transition metal dichalcogenides , such as mos@xmath0 , @xcite mose@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 @xcite and wse@xmath0 @xcite , have been synthesized and attracted both experimental and theoretical interests because of their relatively large and direct band gap as well as good carrier mobilities . to the best of our knowledge , except these binary compounds containing chalcogen , 2d monolayered structures of simple group vi elements has not been reported before .",
    "the group - vi elements possess a valence configuration of @xmath1@xmath2 , and their stable structures show systematic change from diatomic molecules ( o ) through rings , chains and helices ( s , se , te ) to the only simple cubic lattice found in one element ( po ) .",
    "the most stable structure of te at the atmospheric pressure is a trigonal one , which consists of helical chains parallel to the _ c_-axis,@xcite and each atom covalently bonds to two neighbors within a chain while the interchain bonding is relatively weak .",
    "this inherent anisotropy makes it an ideal candidate for the generation of 1d nanostructures .",
    "for example , 1d te nanocrystals , including te nanotubes , nanorods , nanowires , and nanobelts , have been synthesized through different routes.@xcite    despite the strong tendency to grow into one - dimensional nanoarchitecture , it is also possible for te to form 2d structure .",
    "recently , the hexagonal te nanoplates have been successfully realized on flexible mica sheets via van der waals epitaxy.@xcite however , the te hexagonal nanoplate has a thickness about 32 nm , which is different from the atomically thinned 2d crystal .",
    "although one monolayer of te has been tried to deposite on the cdte ( 111 ) surface with the molecular beam epitaxy method,@xcite the crystal structure of 2d monolayer te could not be determined because of the strong covalent bonding between the adsorbed te atoms and substrate . therefore , whether the 2d monolayer structure can be realized in the scope of chalcogen , just as succeeded in carbon group and pnictogens , is still an open question .    here , we investigated the possibilities of 2d materials for chalcogen based on first - principles calculations , and a novel 2d semiconductor , namely tellurene ( te monolayer ) , is predicted .",
    "it is composed of planner four - membered and chair - like six - membered rings alternately arranged in a 2d lattice .",
    "the monolayer tellurene shows a direct band gap of 1.04 ev .",
    "interestingly , both the band gap and transport properties of tellurene can be tuned by strains , which make it promising in applications such as electronic and optoelectronic devices .",
    "as the reference , the optimized structure of trigonal tellurium ( t - te ) is a monoclinic phase with space group p3@xmath321 , which consists of helical chains arranged in a hexagonal array along _ c _ direction , shown in figure 1a .",
    "figure 1b presents the proposed structure of tellurene , which is composed of planner four - membered and chair - like six - membered rings arranged alternately in a 2d lattice .",
    "the optimized unit cell is spanned by lattice vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with a = 5.49  and b = 4.17  , respectively . in tellurene , te atom favors threefold and fourfold coordinations instead of the twofold coordination in its bulk counterpart .",
    "the short and long bonds are 2.75 and 3.01  , respectively .",
    "the van der waals radii of the te atom is about 2.36  @xcite which indicates that covalent bonds are dominant in tellurene .",
    "as shown in figure 1c , the calculated charge density difference illustrates that , besides the strong covalent bonds between two te atoms with the coordination number ( cn ) of three , the te atoms with cn = 4 also bond to its four neighbor te atoms .",
    "the vanished strong interlayer van der waals interactions in t - te may play an important role in the structure transition from bulk helical chains to the hypervalent monolayer structure .",
    "the atoms of tellurene are much closer together than those of bulk phase , due to the vanished van der waals interactions .    ) .",
    "[ fig : figure1],width=453 ]    to examine the relative stability of tellurene , the formation energy is studied by calculation of the cohesive energy difference @xmath6@xmath7 = @xmath7(3d)- @xmath7(2d ) , where @xmath7(2d ) and @xmath7(3d ) are the cohesive energies in the 2d tellurene and 3d structure of t - te , respectively . in general , this is the energy cost to synthesize the single - layer material from its three - dimensional bulk counterpart .",
    "the lower formation energy indicates that the candidate single - layer material is more stable .",
    "the calculated @xmath6@xmath7 of tellunene is 0.23 ev / atom , much smaller than the formation energies of silicene ( 0.76 ev / atom ) and germanene ( 0.99 ev / atom ) having been experimentally fabricated , @xcite which indicates that tellurene is also expected to be synthesized in the experiment .",
    "actually , it is very important to examine the stability and feasibility in experiment for new 2d crystals .",
    "phonon calculations , reflecting whether there are soft modes , provide a criterion to judge the structure stability.@xcite hence , the phonon spectrum is examined , shown in figure 2 ( left panel ) .",
    "it is clearly revealed no soft phonon modes in the computed phonon dispersion spectrum of tellurene , predicting that tellurene is kinetically stable .",
    "the displacement patterns corresponding to the six optical modes at @xmath8 point are plotted in right panels in figure 2 , which illustrate the different characteristics of bond stretching and bending . among these displacement patterns , ( a ) and",
    "( d ) correspond to the lo modes at @xmath8 point , ( c ) and ( e ) correspond to the to modes , and ( b ) and ( f ) correspond to the two zo modes , respectively .",

    "point corresponds to the speed of sound and the in - plane stiffness .",
    "right panels show the displacement patterns of six optical modes at @xmath8 point shown in the vibrational band structure .",
    "[ fig : figure2],width=453 ]    to further understand the stability and structural rigidity of tellurene , the slopes of the longitudinal acoustic branches near @xmath8 point , which correspond to the speed of sound and reveal the in - plane stiffness , are calculated . as seen in figure 2",
    ", the speed of sound in tellurene is @xmath9 along the @xmath8-y direction , and @xmath10 along the @xmath8-x direction .",
    "the speed of sound along the @xmath8-y direction is faster than that along @xmath8-x , which reflects an anisotropy in the elastic constants of tellurene .",
    "the lower rigidity along the @xmath8-x direction , corresponding to the @xmath4 direction in figure 1b , reflects the fact that compression along the armchair direction requires primarily bond bending , which is lower in energy cost than bond stretching .",
    "the anisotropic characters of the elastic constants in tellurene are similar to that in phosphonene.@xcite furthermore , the calculated flexural rigidity d also provides a quantitative explanation for the anisotropy in the elastic constants of tellurene , which can be extracted from total energy of nanotube with different diameter .",
    "the calculation details are presented in the support information ( figure s1 ) .",
    "we have estimated @xmath11 along the armchair direction and @xmath12 along the zigzag direction for tellurene , respectively .",
    ", width=529 ]    to further clarify the stability of tellurene at elevated temperatures , we performe the _ ab initio _ md calculations of the monolayer as well as flakes .",
    "the temperatures are kept at 300 and 1000 k , respectively , covering time periods up to 1 _",
    "_ p__s with a time step of 1 _ _ f__s .",
    "the high rigidity of a free - standing tellurene monolayer is confirmed by the md calculations at nonzero temperatures . as shown in figure 3 ,",
    "the infinite monolayer of tellurene exhibits slight changes at room temperature , revealing the high structural rigidity .",
    "the detailed results are presented in the supplemental information ( figure s2 and movies ) .    ) .",
    "the vertical dash line indicates the fermi level .",
    "[ fig : figure4],width=415 ]    the band structures and the electron density of states are also calculated to explore the electronic properties of tellurene , shown in figure 4 . it is distinctly found that the spin - orbital coupling ( soc ) has a significant influence on the electronic structure of tellurene . as shown in figure 4a , the band structure shows an indirect band gap without soc , but exhibits a direct band gap of 1.04 ev with soc .",
    "figure 4b presents the calculated total and partial dos of tellurene .",
    "it is obviously manifested that the dos near the fermi level is predominantly _",
    "p _ like states with almost negligible contributions of _ s _ and _ d _ electrons . to gain further insights into the electronic structure ,",
    "the spatial distributions of the valence band maximum ( vbm ) and the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) of tellurene are also examined ( insets of figure 4b ) .",
    "both the vbm and cbm originate mainly from the _ p _ atomic orbitals , and the vbm is bonding - like along the armchair direction while cbm is antibonding - like state .",

    "[ fig : figure5],width=377 ]    it has been shown that applying external strain is an effective way to tune the electronic properties of 2d materials.@xcite the band gap of tellurene also depends sensitively on the applied in - layer strain .",
    "figure 5 presents the band structures of tellurene under the biaxial strains from -10% to 6% .",
    "it is found that cbm shifts down gradually towards the fermi level as the tensile strain increases from 0% to 6% , whereas the energy of vbm almost does not change , resulting in the reduced band gap , and the band gap reduced to 0.86 ev under the tensile strain of 6% .",
    "this manifests that the band gap of stretched tellurene is dominated by the cbm .",
    "nevertheless , the stretched tellurene still retains the character of direct band gap .",
    "on the other hand , the monolayer tellurene undergoes a direct - to - indirect band - gap transition under the compressed strain .",
    "it is found that a relatively small critical strain about -2% can induce a direct - to - indirect band gap transition .",
    "the cbm shifts from @xmath8 to x point under the compressed strain , which rapidly transforms tellurene into an indirect band gap semiconductor . in tellurene ,",
    "the bonds among te atoms may have the dual characteristics of metal and covalence , and there exists a competition between them in the strained stages .",
    "the covalent bonding may be dominant under the stretched strain , which will decrease the bonding between the _ p _ orbitals , leading to the separation of bonding and antibonding states getting smaller near the fermi level .",
    "on the other hand , the metal bonding characteristic may be critical when the tellurene is compressed .",
    "the overlaps between _ p _ orbitals of te atoms will be strengthened as the compressed strain increases , which improves the power of charge transportation .",
    "meanwhile , the band gap becomes small and presents a metallic character under @xmath13 = -10% .",
    ", width=377 ]    in order to better understand the strain effects on the electronic properties of tellurene , uniaxial strains along armchair and zigzag directions of the lattice are also applied , respectively ( figure s3 and figure s4 ) .",
    "the results suggest that the strain effects of tellurene exhibit very strong anisotropy .",
    "as shown in figure 6 , the compressed strain along the zigzag direction critically influences the electronic structure , which modulates the band gap of tellurene , similar to that of biaxial strain .",
    "however , the band gap does not change much along armchair direction under the compressed strain from 0% to -10% .",
    "moreover , the tensile strain along the armchair direction shows more significant effect on tuning the band structure of tellurene than that along the zigzag direction from @xmath13 = 0% to 6% .",
    "one of the main interests in 2d semiconductors is the observed high mobility of carriers such as graphene and phosphorene . in order to provide further insights into the charge transport properties of tellurene , the effective masses of electrons at the cbm ( _ _ m__@xmath14 ) and of holes at the vbm ( _ _ m__@xmath15 )",
    "are calculated using @xmath16 where _ e _ and _ k _ correspond to the energy and the reciprocal lattice vector along the axis .",
    "in solid theory , it is thought that the charge carrier mobility is inversely proportional to the effective mass if there is no change in the time scale for quasi particle scattering . based on this",
    ", we can simply define the mobility @xmath17 as    @xmath18 according to the above formula , changes in effective mass can influence charge carrier transport properties . under zero strain ,",

    "the results suggest that the compressed strain significantly affects the electron effective mass , i.e. strongly influences the electron transport of tellurene .",
    "_ m__@xmath21 shows a significant jump at the maximum values of 2.48 _ _ m__@xmath20 under the compressed strain of -2% , and subsequently decreases with the strain from -2% to -10% .",
