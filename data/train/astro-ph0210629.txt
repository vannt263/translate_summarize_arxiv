    "we live in a spiral galaxy , so the best ",
    "studied globular cluster system will likely always be the milky way s . to understand",
    "if the milky way gcs is typical , we need to study the globular cluster systems of other spirals . if spiral ",
    "spiral mergers are important in elliptical galaxy and gcs formation , information about spiral gcss is needed to predict the properties of elliptical gcss .",
    "spiral galaxies contain most of the star formation in the nearby universe , so they can provide the links between the star formation we study nearby and the high  redshift kind which formed globular clusters and galaxy halos .",
    "gcs can be observed at much greater distances than individual extragalactic bulge or halo stars , so they remain one of the best ways of studying the formation of late - type galaxies .    despite the importance of spiral galaxy gcss ,",
    "they are poorly  studied compared to those of ellipticals .",
    "this is unsurprising , since ellipticals have more globular clusters ( there are no giant spirals with thousands of gcs like m87 ) , and their clusters are easier to find since the galaxy light can be subtracted much more easily .",
    "the largest populations of nearby galaxies are in clusters like virgo and fornax , where spiral galaxies are less common than in the field .",
    "as i was preparing my talk , i searched the astrophysics data system for the words spiral  globular  in the titles of refereed papers .",
    "the tenth result was titled photographic effective wavelengths of spiral nebulae and globular clusters  , and published in 1919 @xcite !    in this review , i will emphasize recent observational results on the globular cluster systems of well  studied spiral galaxies .",
    "these are ( unfortunately ) still few enough in number to be discussed individually .",
    "m31 probably gets somewhat more emphasis than it should , mostly by virtue of being my thesis galaxy !",
    "some galaxies and topics are not discussed here since they are covered elsewhere in these proceedings .",
    "theories of globular cluster system formation have mostly concentrated on elliptical galaxies , so relatively little emphasis is placed on theoretical interpretations . at the end of the review , i summarize what is known , and still unknown , about the globular cluster systems of spirals .",
    "the individual gcs in the milky way are still important objects of study , and many reports of results can be found in the proceedings of a meeting ( new horizons in globular cluster astronomy  , padua ) held shortly before the eso workshop .",
    "an excellent review of the milky way gcs can be found in w. harris saas ",
    "fee lectures @xcite .",
    "here i mention some highlights of new results on the milky way globular cluster system .",
    "one important question is : what is the total population of the milky way gcs ?",
    "the june 1999 edition of the harris catalog @xcite lists 147 objects .",
    "several recent estimates place the total number of gcs at about 160 @xcite .",
    "two gcs hidden in the galactic plane were recently discovered in the 2mass database @xcite , and other searches for star clusters in the milky way are underway @xcite .",
    "the issue of bimodality in gcs color distributions was discussed extensively at this workshop .",
    "the milky way is one of the few galaxies where a clear bimodality in metallicity ( as opposed to color ) can be seen ; a nice example of this is fig .",
    "[ cotefig ] , from a paper by ct @xcite .",
    "he also shows that there is a clear difference in the kinematics of the two metallicity groups , and suggests that the metal ",
    "rich clusters are more likely to be associated with the galactic bulge or bar , rather than the disk .",
    "another recent development is the compilation of several large databases of color  magnitude diagrams for milky way gcs , including a database of hst @xmath0 cmds for nearly half the mw gcs @xcite , and ground  based cmds for large numbers of clusters @xcite .",
    "the two groups with ground  based cmd databases have used them to investigate the age distribution of milky way globular clusters , with similar results ( see fig .  [ swfig ] ) . the most metal",
    " poor clusters ( [ fe / h]@xmath1 ) are found to be coeval and old , with an average age of about 12 gyr .",
    "intermediate  metallicity clusters ( @xmath2}<-1.0 $ ] ) show a spread in ages of about 2 gyr , and the most metal  rich clusters are found to be coeval and somewhat younger than the metal  poor ones . when age is compared to @xmath3 ,",
    "the outer halo clusters are the ones with the age spread .",
    "some , but not all , of the age spread can be explained by considering age as the second parameter , that is , the cause of different horizontal branch types in clusters of the same metallicity .",
    "globular cluster destruction was discussed extensively at this meeting ( e.g. , by vesperini ) , and there is good observational evidence that this process is actually taking place . a wide  field",
    "photographic imaging study @xcite finds that almost all of the 20 mw gcs studied show evidence of interactions with the galaxy ( tidal tails , etc ) . a photometric study using data from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite maps out the distribution of the cluster palomar 5 on the sky",
    " nearly half its stars are in the tidal tails .",
    "the large sky coverage and photometric stability of the sdss will no doubt enable many more such investigations .",
    "although the m31 gcs has been extensively studied since hubble @xcite , the size of the gcs is embarrassingly uncertain .",
    "observational difficulties are the primary reason : the m31 gcs covers a large area on the sky , and the non  stellar appearance of m31 gcs makes them easily confused with background galaxies .",
    "several ongoing ccd surveys of m31 @xcite should be useful in clarifying the completeness of the photographic surveys .",
    "a model of the completeness of existing m31 gc surveys using hst data yielded an estimate of the total number of m31 gcs as @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the metallicity distribution of the m31 gcs shows clear evidence for bimodality @xcite , and perrett ( these proceedings ) analyses the difference in kinematics and spatial distribution between the two metallicity groups . as with the milky way gcs ,",
    "the age distribution of m31 gcs is much less well  known than the metallicity distribution . by comparing the integrated colors of m31 gcs with stellar population models",
    ", i concluded that the metal  rich gcs in m31 are younger than the metal ",
    "poor clusters @xcite ; but integrated photometry is a rather blunt instrument , and spectroscopic and cmd studies are needed .",
    "at least a few of the objects listed in the m31 gc catalogs are actually quite young @xcite .",
    "the m31 globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) has been studied for a long time , with the usual difficulties of correcting for incompleteness and reddening .",
    "many studies have shown that the luminosity function of the halo clusters is very similar to that in the milky way .",
    "with huchra and brodie , i attempted to compute luminosity functions for subsamples of the full gcs , correcting for incompleteness and reddening @xcite .",
    "we found evidence for gclf variation with both distance from the galaxy center ( due to destruction ? ) and metallicity ( due to age ? ) .",
    "the gclf variation is an effect not seen in other galaxies , and to confirm it we intend to acquire the data necessary to analyze the gclf in the near  infrared , where reddening is less of a problem .",
    "the hubble space telescope has done a lot for the field of extragalactic globular clusters . in m31",
    "it allows both surface photometry and color  magnitude studies , since the clusters are resolved into individual stars .",
    "measurements of structural parameters for @xmath5 clusters from hst data @xcite showed that they have very similar properties to milky way clusters .",
    "the two galaxies clusters fall on similar trends in the fundamental plane @xcite of binding energy , luminosity , and concentration ( see fig .  [ xrayfig ] ) , which implies that they have very similar mass - to - light ratios , and probably similar evolutionary histories . the m31 metal ",
    "rich clusters have slightly smaller sizes than the metal  poor ones ( see sect .  [ m104sec ] ) .",
    "other recent hst studies of m31 gcs include the work of clementini et al .",
    "@xcite , who reported the first detection of rr lyrae stars in m31 gcs .",
    "continuation of this work will provide another population ii method of determining the distance to m31 , as well as allowing the study of the oosterhoff phenomenon in another galaxy .",
    "a detailed study of the large m31 cluster g1 @xcite shows it to be similar to the milky way s",
    "@xmath6  cen : it has a large ellipticity , large mass and multiple stellar populations .",
    "meylan et al.suggest that g1 is possibly the stripped nucleus of a dwarf elliptical galaxy ; a similar idea has been put forward for @xmath6  cen @xcite .",
    "zinnecker ( this meeting ) suggested that all gcs might be dwarf galaxy nuclei ; while this may not be a plausible way to form all gcs , perhaps it is workable for the largest gcs in a galaxy .",
    "the high spatial resolution of _ chandra _ has allowed the definitive identification of x - ray sources in local group galaxies with their optical counterparts .",
    "a survey of three acis fields in m31 @xcite found that the most luminous x - ray sources are in gcs , and some of these are much more x - ray luminous than milky way gc x - ray sources .",
    "the m31 clusters with x - ray sources tend to be optically brighter ( both in integrated magnitude and central surface brightness ) than those without ; although not statistically significant , there is also a hint that they are more concentrated ( see fig .",
    "[ xrayfig ] ) .",
    "this agrees with the general idea that the frequency of dynamical interactions determines the number of x - ray binaries and that this scales with cluster central density .",
    "the larger number of m31 x - ray gcs should allow a much more detailed comparison of cluster and x - ray source properties .",
    "many spiral galaxies contain young , massive star clusters ( larsen , this meeting ) , and the local group spiral m33 is no exception .",
    "chandar and collaborators have recently carried out an extensive study of the m33 cluster system @xcite@xcite .",
    "using hst images , they identify many new star clusters in m33 , and estimate the total number of gcs at @xmath7 .",
    "this is a much larger value than previous estimates , and if correct would give m33 a fairly large specific frequency ( see table  1 ) .",
    "it is clear that the the gcs have a much larger velocity dispersion than the young star clusters ( see fig .",
    "[ m33fig ] ) .",
    "there are still relatively few m33 gcs with radial velocities , so understanding their kinematics is difficult .",
    "modeling suggests that most belong to the halo rather than the disk @xcite .    the small number of m33 gc candidates known before the chandar et al .",
    "work have been heavily studied .",
    "hst imaging of 10 halo clusters @xcite showed that 8 of them have red horizontal branches , an indicator of possible intermediate ( @xmath8  gyr ) ages . a spectrophotometric study @xcite yielded similar results .",
    "however , high resolution spectroscopy and hst surface photometry of four of these clusters @xcite shows that they have similar mass - to - light ratios to the milky way globulars ( @xmath9 ) , and fall on the same fundamental plane .",
    "this is puzzling since @xmath10 is expected to be lower for younger clusters .",
    "preliminary work on _",
    "chandra _ sources in m33 @xcite indicates that none are associated with gcs .",
    "this might also argue against younger ages , since younger clusters would have a higher turnoff mass and be more likely to have luminous x - ray binaries ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this meeting saw some debate about whether m104 ( the sombrero ) is a spiral galaxy with a large bulge , or an elliptical galaxy with a disk .",
    "since there are already many more elliptical galaxies than spirals with gcs information , i consider it a spiral for this review .",
    "recent works include hst imaging by larsen et al .",
    "@xcite : for three fields near the center of m104 , they find a total of @xmath11 gc candidates and estimate a total gcs population of about 1200@xmath12 .",
    "the gc candidates have a bimodal color distribution : 45% blue and 55% red , somewhat different from the 65%35% division seen in the milky way and m31 .",
    "there is a size difference between red and blue clusters ( see fig .",
    "[ m104fig ] ) , although it is difficult to tell whether this is because the red clusters are located closer to the center of the galaxy .",
    "previous spectroscopy of the m104 clusters has so far included fairly small samples of objects @xcite .",
    "both groups were able to estimate a mean metallicity for the cluster system ( [ fe / h ] @xmath13 ) and estimate the total mass of the galaxy .",
    "several groups presented new observations of m104 gcs at this meeting , including vlt imaging ( moretti ) and spectroscopy ( held ) , and 2df spectroscopy ( bridges ) .",
    "these new data should allow the detailed kinematical studies not possible with previous observations .",
    "aside from a few papers in the mid-1990s @xcite , the m81 gcs has received little attention until very recently .",
    "hst imaging of 8 fields @xcite revealed 114 new clusters , of which about half were red enough to be old gcs .",
    "the total number of globular clusters was estimated at @xmath14 , with no bimodality detected in the gc color distributions .",
    "two groups have obtained spectra of m81 gc candidates @xcite ; the latter group ( schroder et al . )",
    "studied the combined sample of 44 gcs .",
    "the spectroscopic metallicities have large uncertainties , so they did not formally test for a bimodal distribution . using colors as a rough metallicity indicator , schroder et al . analyzed the kinematics of two groups , finding that the red clusters rotate with the disk , and the blue clusters show no rotation .",
    "the red clusters rotation signature is strongest for @xmath15  kpc , leading to the suggestion that these clusters ( and also their analogs in m31 and the milky way ) comprise a thick disk population .",
    "this is at odds with other analyses of both the milky way and m31 gcs kinematics , so perhaps a larger sample of m81 gcs will tell a different story .",
    "the clusters in these two edge - on galaxies were studied by kissler ",
    "patig et al .",
    "@xcite , using @xmath16 and @xmath17 imaging from hst .",
    "although these two galaxies have quite different structural properties , their globular cluster systems appear to be quite similar",
    ". only small numbers of gcs were detected in each galaxy , so the total number of clusters was estimated by comparing a model of the selection effects to the spatial distribution of milky way clusters .",
    "no bimodality was detected in the cluster candidate color distributions , but the mean colors of clusters in ngc  4565 and ngc  5907 were consistent with the mean metallicity of the mw gcs . there is some indication that the ngc  5907 gcs is flattened , of interest because this galaxy may also have a flattened halo .",
    "a few less  well  studied spiral galaxies are collected here .",
    "some have new gcs studies in progress , while others were studied some time ago and might benefit from a revisit with new telescope and/or more sensitive detectors .",
    "no detailed study of globular clusters has been done in the large nearby face  on spiral * m101 * , although a study of one hst / wfpc2 field @xcite detected 6 gc candidates and numerous young clusters .",
    "an upcoming survey of m101 with the new acs on hst ( pi : k. kuntz ) should allow a much more thorough study .",
    "another upcoming study is the thesis of k. rhode , who has obtained extensive data on the gcss of several nearby edge - on spirals .",
    "these data will be extremely valuable for comparison of the gcss of spirals and ellipticals . in these proceedings",
    ", rhode discusses the gcs of * ngc  7814*.    also in these proceedings , olsen discusses imaging of the gcss of spirals in the sculptor group : * ngc  55 , 247 , 253 * and * 300*. these galaxies are nearby , which makes their clusters bright , but also means that gcs are more likely to be confused with background galaxies .",
    "beasley & sharples @xcite found that almost all of the ngc  253 and ngc  55 gc candidates they obtained spectra for were in fact galaxies .",
    "fischer et al .",
    "@xcite used early ccd images ( @xmath18 pixels ) to study the gcs of * ngc  5170*. they detected @xmath19 gc candidates , and estimated the total population at @xmath20 .",
