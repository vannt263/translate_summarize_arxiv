    "semiclassical general relativity predicts violations of the point - wise energy conditions associated with negative energy phenomena such as warp drives , traversable wormholes@xcite , and even _ _ time machines__@xcite .",
    "however , the same theory can be used to constrain the magnitude and duration of negative energy pulses .",
    "two of these restrictions are given by the quantum inequalities ( qis ) and the quantum interest conjecture ( qic ) .",
    "the qis@xcite impose a lower bound on the expectation value ( in a quantum state @xmath0 ) of the renormalized stress - energy tensor along a timelike geodesic , @xmath1 weighted by a non - negative and normalized test function @xmath2 .",
    "the initial bounds on @xmath3 depended on the modified bessel functions , and were obtained using a lorentzian test function@xcite . eventually flanagan found a more general bound in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional minkowski space for a massless scalar field@xcite , which does not depend on the specific choice of the test function , @xmath4 similarly , fewster and eveson obtained bounds in ( 1 + 1 ) and ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional flat space@xcite .",
    "although their two dimensional inequality is slightly weaker than ( [ flanagan ] ) , their result for ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions is the most general and optimum bound for a massless scalar field , @xmath5''(t)\\right)^2\\,dt.\\ ] ] both inequalities , ( [ flanagan ] ) and ( [ few&eve ] ) , can be written as a more general statement for @xmath6-dimensional spacetime@xcite , @xmath7 with @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the derivative operator , and the set of constants @xmath10 are given by @xmath11 the test function is now normalized such that @xmath12 .",
    "it is easy to check that we recover equations ( [ flanagan ] ) and ( [ few&eve ] ) from ( [ qi ] ) , by setting @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , by integrating by parts , the qis become a statement regarding the lack of negative eigenvalues for a one - dimensional pseudo - hamiltonian , @xmath15 where @xmath16 here @xmath17 is effectively a _ potential _ for a quantum mechanical system .",
    "therefore it is possible to use the point of view of one - dimensional quantum mechanics ( after some technical considerations@xcite ) to reduce the qis to a much _ simpler _ framework .",
    "once the quantum mechanical viewpoint is adopted , it is more convenient to also use its notation",
    ". then the _ operator _",
    "@xmath18 can be written as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are operators in the usual hilbert space of square - integrable functions .",
    "this technical construction allows us to rewrite the eigenvalue problem in coordinates , as an ordinary differential equation for the eigenfunctions @xmath22 ( the test functions @xmath23 used before ) ; the _ multiharmonic _ time - independent schrdinger equation ( sde ) , @xmath24 where we have set @xmath25 to simplify the algebra . again ,",
    "if @xmath13 we recover the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional case in the form of the time - independent sde , @xmath26 fortunately in this case , there is a theorem by simon@xcite , which guarantees the existence of a negative eigenvalue for the sde , if @xmath27    with this theorem , the qic can be related to the qis in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "it is also possible to reformulate the qic for a more general set of energy pulses@xcite , unlike the original formulation , which is restricted to @xmath28-function pulses@xcite . to see this clearly ,",
    "let us split the potential as @xmath29 its positive part minus its negative part .",
    "then in order to guarantee positive eigenvalues , the potential must violate ( [ simon ] ) .",
    "that is , @xmath30 since here the potential @xmath21 represents the expectation value of the renormalized stress - energy tensor , it is clear that to fulfill the qis the net energy density must always be positive , i.e. , its positive part must always overcompensate the negative one .",
    "this is a simplified version of the original formulation of the qic@xcite .",
    "the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional case can be recovered from the multiharmonic sde by choosing @xmath14 .",
    "this yields the _ biharmonic _ sde , @xmath31 however , we now need to generalize simon s theorem for ( [ bsde ] ) .",
    "first , via a variational argument , the lowest eigenvalue @xmath32 of ( [ bsde ] ) satisfies @xmath33 \\d x,\\ ] ] assuming all the test functions are normalized .",
    "secondly , let us choose the following test function @xmath34 we then enforce the normalization @xmath35 to obtain @xmath36 and @xmath37 note that the kinetic term of ( [ eigenval ] ) , @xmath38'')^2\\d x}{\\sigma^4},\\ ] ] diverges .",
    "it contains a term proportional to @xmath28-function square , which arises from differentiating twice the absolute value . nevertheless , by expanding the normalized functions @xmath39 into a power series , @xmath40 we can get rid of the troublesome term by properly setting the expansion coefficient @xmath41 to zero . moreover , to make ( [ kinetic ] ) converge at zero , we also need @xmath42 . the rest of the coefficients can be freely chosen .",
    "then we have , from ( [ eigenval ] ) , ( [ test ] ) and ( [ gexpan ] ) @xmath43 with @xmath44'')^2\\d x$ ] . now choosing a sufficiently large @xmath45 , it is clear that @xmath46 implies a negative eigenvalue for the differential equation .",
    "lastly , it is possible to collect more information from ( [ expand ] ) if we set @xmath47 .",
    "then the next two terms become relevant . and",
    "since the sign and magnitude of @xmath48 and @xmath49 are arbitrary , either @xmath50 or @xmath51 is a sufficient condition to guarantee the absence of a bound state .",
    "differentiating twice the last expression with respect to @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 and finally @xmath54 .",
    "that is , if @xmath47 , a necessary condition for the lack of a bound state is that @xmath54 .",
    "this proves the extension of simon s theorem for the biharmonic sde , and it also proves the qic in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional minkowski space .    to clarify the proof of the qic , we must recover the notation of semiclassical general relativity .",
    "then the version of the qic we just proved states that the qis imply , either @xmath55 everywhere along the world line , _ or _",
    "@xmath56 which is slightly stronger than the awec . once again , splitting the energy density into its positive part minus its negative part , @xmath57 the positive energy density must overcompensate the negative part elsewhere along the world line .",
    "by proving the variant of simon s theorem for the biharmonic sde , we were able to reformulate the qic in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional flat spacetime similarly to the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional case studied in references and .",
    "in flat spacetime , an energy pulse which satisfies the qis ( and the qic proved above ) must also fulfill an awec - like inequality .",
    "although several technical aspects have not been mentioned here , a more detailed proof of the qic in flat spacetime can be found in reference .",
