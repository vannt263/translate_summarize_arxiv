    "in the last few years improved observations @xcite have forced a shift in our cosmological paradigm : the @xmath2 dust model has been swept aside and , in its place , we are faced with the problem of understanding a universe with an equation of state @xmath3 . that is to say , on average , pressure is comparable with density and , moreover , negative .    of course ,",
    "parametrically , this is readily accommodated by a cosmological constant @xmath4 @xcite with @xmath5 0.7 and @xmath6 0.3 ( throughout the paper we neglect the small baryonic contribution ) .",
    "the well - known difficulty with @xmath4 is that _ a priori _ it seems an incredible accident that @xmath7 since @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the scale factor .",
    "hence , much attention has been devoted to quintessence @xcite , involving a real scalar field which tracks @xcite the background component until recently becoming dominant .",
    "however , simple tracking quintessence does not work @xcite and spintessence @xcite , where the scalar field is complex , suffers instabilities against the decay of dark energy into dark matter @xcite .",
    "it is natural to conjecture that some of the aforementioned problems derive from treating dark matter and dark energy as separate issues . as an example ,",
    "barr and seckel @xcite have pointed out that in axion dark matter models quantum gravity effects break the pecci - quinn symmetry leading to a universe trapped in a false vacuum with an effective @xmath4 of the correct magnitude . in another approach ,",
    "wetterich @xcite has suggested that traditional wimp dark matter should be replaced by quintessence lumps , thus unifying dark matter and dark energy .",
    "however , the radiation - matter transition and structure formation remain open questions in this scenario .    herein we present a dark matter - energy unification model suggested by the observation of kamenshchik et al . @xcite that a perfect fluid obeying the chaplygin gas equation of state @xmath10 should lead to a homogenous cosmology with @xmath11 with @xmath12 being an integration constant , thus interpolating between dark matter , @xmath13 and dark energy @xmath14 . before doing so",
    ", we must first show why eq .",
    "( [ eq01 ] ) , aside from its interesting mathematical features @xcite , might describe reality .",
    "one of the most profound recent developments in fundamental physics has been the recognition that all of the extra dimensions required by string/@xmath1-theory do not have to be of the planck length size : one ( or more ) could be as large as 0.1 mm provided that all standard - model fields except gravity are confined to a 3-dimensional hypersurface or ` brane ' in the higher dimensional bulk ( for a review see @xcite ) . in this context ,",
    "kamenshchik et al .",
    "@xcite obtained eq .",
    "( [ eq01 ] ) from the stabilization of branes in black hole bulks .    a simple way to see",
    "the connection between the chaplygin gas and the brane world is to follow sundrum s @xcite effective field theory for the 3- brane .",
    "the gauge fixed embedding of a 3 + 1 brane in a 4 + 1 bulk is described by @xmath15 . with some nominal assumptions on the bulk metric @xmath16 ,",
    "the induced metric on the 3-brane is @xmath17 with 0 @xmath18 , and the action for the brane reads @xmath19",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int d^{4 } x   \\sqrt{- g } \\sqrt{1 - g^{\\mu \\nu } \\theta _ { , \\mu } \\theta _ { , \\nu } } \\left [ - f^{4 } - \\cdots \\right ] , \\label{eq04}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the brane tension and the ellipsis includes standard - model fields as well as higher - order terms in power counting .",
    "one estimates @xmath21 mev .    retaining only the leading term in eq .",
    "( [ eq04 ] ) and renaming @xmath22 , one sees that its content is equivalent to @xmath23 @xmath24 since @xmath25 can be eliminated through its field equation @xmath26 we observe that @xmath27 corresponds to the lagrangian for a complex field @xmath28 in the ` thomas - fermi ' approximation .",
    "the thomas - fermi approximation amounts to neglecting @xmath29 compared to @xmath30 , i.e. , the scale of variation of @xmath25 is large compared to the compton wavelength .",
    "it is also worth noting that dividing @xmath27 by @xmath31 , the first term is the periodic gaussian model with coupling @xmath32 .",
    "the potential @xmath33 , which is self - dual , can be interpreted as the mean field free - energy for ` brane cells ' filling a system of size @xmath34 , in analogy to rama s @xcite ` string bit ' analysis of black holes .    to complete the connection to the chaplygin gas",
    ", we point out a field - fluid duality : for @xmath35 , eq . ( [ eq07 ] ) defines a fluid 4-velocity @xmath36 = 1 , @xmath37 and then the energy - momentum tensor derived from @xmath27 takes the perfect fluid form with @xmath38 in particular , for @xmath39 of eq .",
    "( [ eq06 ] ) , the equation of state ( [ eq01 ] ) follows , and the energy density @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 which is to say that matter corresponds to a wrinkled brane .",
    "finally , it must be said that the procedure can be reversed @xcite .",
    "the equations @xmath42 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq09 ] ) , allow one to construct @xmath43 and @xmath39 given the equation of state . as an example , starting from @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with the relativistic limits coinciding , eqs .",
    "( [ eq01 ] ) , ( [ eq06 ] ) , and ( [ eq04 ] ) follow .",
    "as yet , we have not dealt with the @xmath46 field equation ; in the fluid language , it reads @xmath47 in comoving coordinates , @xmath48 , the solution for the chaplygin gas is @xcite @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the determinant of the induced metric @xmath51 which measures physical distances , and @xmath52 can be taken as constant on the scales of interest .    the generalization ( [ eq13 ] ) of eq . ( [ eq02 ] ) allows us to implement the geometric version @xcite of the zeldovich approximation @xcite : the transformation from lagrange to euler ( comoving ) coordinates induces @xmath53 as @xmath54 with @xmath55 the deformation tensor , @xmath56 the velocity potential . inserting this ansatz in the 0 - 0 einstein equation to first order in @xmath56 yields the evolution equation for @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 where we match the parameters @xmath60 , @xmath12 to the @xmath4 model .     from @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , for the chaplygin gas ( solid line ) and @xmath4cdm ( dashed line ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig ] we show the evolution of @xmath57 for the chaplygin gas and for @xmath4 cold dark matter , the latter following by omitting the @xmath64 factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) and changing @xmath65 to @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) . in either case",
    ", the growth @xmath67 ceases near @xmath68 and although @xmath69 remains constant , the perturbative density contrast @xmath70 thereafter vanishes as @xmath71 .",
    "of course the value of the zeldovich approximation is that it offers a means of extrapolation into the nonperturbative regime via eqs .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) and @xmath72 where the @xmath73 are the eigenvalues of @xmath74 .",
    "when one ( or more ) of the @xmath75 s is positive , a caustic forms on which @xmath76 and @xmath77 , i.e. , at the locations where structure forms the chaplygin gas behaves as dark matter .",
    "conversely , when all of the @xmath75 s are negative , a void forms , @xmath40 is driven to its limiting value @xmath31 , and the chaplygin gas behaves as dark energy driving accelerated expansion .",
    "a shortcoming of the zeldovich approximation is that at the caustic matter flows through unimpeded so that structures quickly dissolve @xcite .",
    "this may be circumvented via the truncated zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "a preferable alternative would be an extension of the adhesion approximation @xcite which also allows the extraction of mass functions .",
    "approximation technicalities aside , the case is made that the chaplygin gas offers a realistic unified model of dark matter and dark energy . that this is achieved in a geometric ( brane world )",
    "setting rooted in string/@xmath1 theory makes this model all the more remarkable ."
