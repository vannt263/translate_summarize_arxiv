    "2001 ) .    for hot ehes ( @xmath3 k ) , the lighter neutron - capture elements ( sr , y , zr ) and the heavier elements ( ba and the lanthanides ) are undetectable in optical spectra because ionization equilibrium ensures that the dominant ion is @xmath4 , whose strongest lines are principally in the ultraviolet .",

    "_ optical : _ a high - resolution optical spectrum of v1920cyg was obtained on 1996 july 25 at the w. j. mcdonald observatory s 2.7-m telescope with the coud cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph ( tull et al . 1995 ) at a resolving power of 60,000 .",
    "the observing procedure , the detector , and the wavelength coverage are as described in pandey et al .",
    "model atmospheres from the code sterne and synthetic spectra computed with the belfast lte code spectrum are combined in the analysis ( jeffery , woolf , & pollacco 2001 ) .",
    "input parameters for sterne including the composition were taken from previous abundance analyses .",
    "these parameters are the effective temperature @xmath14 = 16180@xmath15500 k , the surface gravity log @xmath16 = 2.00@xmath150.25 ( cgs units ) , the microturbulent velocity @xmath17 = 15@xmath155 km s@xmath13 , and the abundance ratio c / he = 1% by number of atoms for v1920cyg ( jeffery et al .",

    "derived abundances are sufficiently close to the input values that iteration is unnecessary . the continuous opacity is dominated by photoionization of neutral helium and electron scattering with electrons supplied by helium . in this situation ,",
    "the hei line strengths are insensitive to the abundances of the trace elements , and to @xmath14 , but are sensitive to gravity because the strong lines have stark - broadened wings .",

    "( 2002 ) , respectively .",
    "the estimated abundance uncertainty is followed in brackets by the number of useful lines .",
    "the uncertainty is the combined uncertainty from the estimated errors in the atmospheric parameters or , if larger , the line - to - line scatter in the abundances .",
    "note that for the ultraviolet spectra , the same lines were generally used for both stars and , hence , the abundance ratios between the stars are independent of the adopted @xmath21-values .    several consistency checks were applied to our analyses , especially to the more complete analysis of v1920cyg .",
    "ionization equilibrium for feii / feiii is satisfied for both stars , and for sii / siii for v1920cyg . excitation equilibrium is found for the feiii optical lines for v1920cyg ; the ultraviolet lines used in our analyses do not offer a range in their lower excitation potential .",
    "when an element provides lines in the optical and the ultraviolet spectra of v1920cyg , the abundances are in good agreement .",

    "our optical and ultraviolet spectra of hot ehes were scanned for lines of yiii , zriii , and of the doubly - ionized lanthanides .",
    "inspection of the ultraviolet spectra showed that the two ehes differ dramatically in the abundances of y and zr .",
    "this point is highlighted by figure 1 . in figure 1a ,",
    "the zriii line at 2656.47   is comparable in strength to the mgii lines at 2660.8   in v1920cyg ( lower spectrum ) but in hd124448 the zriii line is extremely weak .",
    "figure 1b shows a similar , albeit less dramatic comparison on account of blends , for the yiii line at 2367.2  .",
    "these differences are not attributable to differences in stellar parameters .",
    "this comparison eliminates the possibility that the lines which we attribute to yiii and zriii are merely unidentified lines of iron or other more abundant species .",
    "the measured wavelengths of yiii and zriii lines were taken from epstein & reader ( 1975 ) and khan , chaghtal & rahimullah ( 1981 ) , respectively .",
    "the yiii resonance lines at 2414.60 , 2367.23 , and 2327.31  are detected in the spectrum of v1920cyg with the 2367.23  line seen as a contributor to a blended line in the spectrum of hd124448 ( figure 1 ) .",

    "an unsuccessful search was conducted for the doubly - ionized lanthanides .",
    "we mention here only those lanthanides providing significant upper limits to the abundances .",
    "a laiii 2379.37  resonance line provides the upper limit for v1920cyg .",
    "an upper limit to the ce abundance is obtained by comparing the synthetic and observed profile of the low excitation ceiii 2603.59  line .",
    "the two strongest resonance lines of ndiii at 5193.06  and at 5294.10  set the upper limit to the nd abundance in v1920cyg .",

    "we have provided the first , abundances of neutron - capture elements for hot ehes .",
    "these neutron - capture element abundances suggest that at least in the ehe star v1920cyg , @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis did occur in its earlier evolution .",
    "an interesting similarity is suggested by these abundances and those of the rcrbs .",
    "a feature of the rcrb stars is the large star - to - star variation in the abundances of the neutron - capture elements . for ` majority '",
    "rcrbs ( lambert & rao 1994 ) , [ y / fe ] and [ zr / fe ] ranges from + 0.3 to about + 1.6 but with smaller values for [ ba / fe ] , [ la / fe ] , and presumably other lanthanides ( asplund et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this range and the non - solar ratio of y and zr to ba and lanthanides was confirmed by rao & lambert ( 2003 ) from a differential analysis of the newly discovered rcrb star v2552 oph and rcrb . among ` minority '",
    "rcrbs ( i.e. , very fe - poor stars ) , somewhat more extreme values are known with a similar contrast between light and neutron - capture elements .",
    "the cool peculiar rcrb u aqr has very extreme neutron - capture element enrichments : [ y / fe ] = + 3.3 and [ ba / fe ] = + 2.1 ( vanture , zucker & wallerstein 1999 ; also bond , luck & newman 1979 ) .",
    "limited data for cool ehes suggest sr , y , or zr abundances within the rcrb range , say [ x / fe ] of 0.0 to + 0.9 ( pandey et al . 2001 ) .",
    "our stis spectra demonstrate that the star - to - star variation in [ y / fe ] and [ zr / fe ] among hot ehes is at least as great as among the ` majority ' rcrb stars : v1920cyg with [ y / fe ] @xmath25 [ zr / fe ] @xmath25 1.6 is at one end of the range and hd124448 with [ y / fe ] @xmath25 [ zr / fe ] @xmath25 + 0.1 is at the other end .",
    "unfortunately , the upper limits set on abundances of lanthanides do not permit us to check that ehes follow rcrbs in showing smaller enrichments of these heavier elements .",
    "the upper limits set for ce and nd in v1920cyg ( [ ce / fe ] @xmath26 + 1.1 and [ nd / fe ] @xmath26 + 1.0 ) hint at a behavior similar to the rcrbs . as noted in the introduction , two scenarios are potential sources of h - deficient luminous stars . a final - flash in a post - agb stars , and a merger of a he with a c - o white dwarf .",
    "the c and o abundances of the hot ehes are consistent with predictions of white dwarf mergers but not the current final - flash models ( pandey et al .",
    "2001 ; saio & jeffery 2002 ) .",
    "saio & jeffery ( 2002 ) also show that a ehe star formed by accretion of he - rich material by a c - o white dwarf has the pulsational properties of real ehe stars .",
    "additionally , a merger better accounts for large line widths seen in spectra of ehes ; the accreting star is spun up by the accreted gas from the ( former ) orbiting he white dwarf . yet ,",
    "the neutron - capture element abundances of the ehes are , perhaps , more readily explained by the final - flash scenario , as suggested by the final - flash candidates fg sge and v4334sgr with neutron - capture element overabundances .",
    "the range in relative overabundances of y and zr to ba and the lanthanides varies greatly between the pair : v4334sgr has a high relative overabundance ( asplund et al .",
    "1997 ) , but fgsge has a low relative overabundance ( gonzalez et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "enrichment of neutron - capture elements is not expected for the ehes unless synthesis by neutrons via the @xmath1-process occurs during the merger ( pandey et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the surface of the c - o white dwarf , the former core of an agb star , will be rich in @xmath1-process products but little of this c - rich material is required at the surface of the star after accretion of he - rich material to account for the observed abundances of the light elements . a thin residual he - shell around the c - o white dwarf core could contribute @xmath1-process products .",
    "the he white dwarf and its possible h - rich skin are not expected to be rich in neutron - capture elements .",
    "one supposes that accretion of the he white dwarf may be accompanied by an episode of nucleosynthesis including release of neutrons through @xmath27c@xmath28o with @xmath27c created by h - burning .",
    "if , as seems plausible , the strength of the neutron source and efficiency of neutron captures varies from merger to merger , the range in the neutron - capture element abundances , as seen here for the ehe pair v1920cyg and hd124448 and known among rcrbs , results .",
    "aspects of the composition of the minority rcrbs suggest nucleosynthesis may accompany the accretion of he - rich material by the c - o white dwarf .",
    "theoretical studies of the merger scenario are to be sought with careful examination of the attendant nucleosynthesis .",
