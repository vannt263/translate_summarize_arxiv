    "galaxy - galaxy lensing provides a powerful tool to statistically measure the mass and the details of the mass distribution for field galaxies ( tyson et al .",
    "1984 ; brainerd et al .  1996 ) .",
    "these studies confirm the existence of massive dark matter halos around typical field galaxies , extending to beyond 100kpc/100kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8=0.5 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "our results however , are not sensitive to values of the cosmological parameters.](brainerd et al .  1996 ; fischer et al .",
    "2000 ; smith et al .  2001b",
    "; mckay et al .  2001 ) .",
    "the same technique can be modified and implemented within clusters to constrain the masses of cluster galaxies ( natarajan & kneib 1997 , nk97 ; geiger & schneider 1998 ) .",
    "successful application of the same to the rich , lensing cluster ac114 at @xmath11 , suggests that the average @xmath12 ratio and spatial extents of the dark matter halos associated with early - type galaxies in such dense environments may differ from those of comparable luminosity field galaxies ( natarajan et al .",
    "1998 , nkse98 ) .",
    "the technique applied by nkse98 quantifies the local weak distortions in the observed shear field of massive cluster - lenses , as perturbations arising from the massive halos of cluster galaxies ( for details see nk97 ) . by associating these perturbations with bright early - type cluster members , the relative mass fraction in their halos",
    "is constrained using a combined @xmath13-maximum likelihood method .",
    "the strength of this approach is the simultaneous use of constraints from the observed strong and weak lensing features .",
    "the fractional mass in clusters associated with individual galaxy halos has important consequences for the frequency and nature of interactions ( moore et al .",
    "1996 ; ghigna et al .  1998 ; okamato & habe 1999 ; merritt 1983 ) .",
    "the theoretical expectation is that the global tidal field of a massive , dense cluster potential well should be strong enough to truncate the dark matter halos of galaxies that traverse the cluster core . in this letter",
    ", we test this expectation using well calibrated mass models for rich clusters at @xmath140.58 that utilize the observed strong lensing features  positions , magnitudes , geometry of multiple images and measured spectroscopic redshifts as well as the shear field .",
    "the clusters in our study are modeled as a super - position of a smooth large - scale potential and smaller scale potentials that are associated with bright early - type cluster members : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the potential of the smooth component and @xmath17 are the potentials of the perturbers ( galaxy halos ) .",
    "the resultant reduced shear @xmath18 , , , a complex number , is defined in terms of the convergence @xmath19 and the shear @xmath20 , as @xmath21 , can be directly related to the measured shape parameter @xmath22 @xmath18 , and can in turn be decomposed into contributions from the smooth clump and perturbers .    to quantify the lensing distortion induced by @xmath23 , the smooth cluster piece and individual galaxy - scale halos",
    "are modeled self - similarly using the pseudo - isothermal elliptical ( piemd ) surface density profile , @xmath24 derived by kassiola & kovner ( 1993 ) , with a core - radius @xmath25 , a truncation radius @xmath26 and an ellipticity @xmath27 .",
    "these parameters are tuned for both the smooth component and the perturbers to obtain mass distributions on the relevant scales ( for details see  2.2 of nk97 ) .",
    "note that @xmath28 characterizes the scale over which the local potential dominates .",
    "additionally , assuming light traces mass , the light distribution of the early - type cluster members is related to the mass model via a set of the usual adopted scaling laws motivated by observations ( see brainerd et al .",
    "1996 ) : @xmath29 the effect of these assumed scaling laws on the maximum - likelihood analysis has been explored in detail using simulations in nk97 . the total mass @xmath30 and the total mass - to - light ratio @xmath12 of cluster galaxies then scales as follows : @xmath31 the ellipticity of the mass clumps is set to the observed ellipticity of each cluster galaxy . since , we are sensitive to the induced local shear arising due to the integrated mass within @xmath28 for the clumps , we are not sensitive to details of the assumed radial fall - off and the assumed inner slope of the profile in the galaxy model .    the measured local shear signal in the cluster at the location of the @xmath32-th perturber is boosted in value due to two effects ( i ) the contribution from the smooth cluster component ",
    "@xmath33 in the numerator , and ( ii ) the ( @xmath34 ) term in the denominator , which is positive and non - negligible in the central cluster region . by taking into account a smooth cluster model it is possible to reduce the error in the measured shear from the cluster members : @xmath35 where @xmath36,@xmath37 and @xmath38 are the shapes of the lensed image ( i ) , unlensed source ( s ) and the shear of the smooth cluster piece",
    "; @xmath39 is the width of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution of the sources , and @xmath40 the number of background galaxies averaged over .",
    "therefore , knowledge of a well calibrated strong lensing model makes the study of galaxy - galaxy lensing in clusters very viable .",
    "a maximum - likelihood method is used to obtain significance bounds on fiducial parameters that characterize a typical @xmath5 halo in the cluster .",
    "we have extended the formalism developed in nk97 to include the strong lensing data for the inner regions of the clusters , these are used to obtain the best model @xmath13 fit followed by a likelihood method that incorporates the constraints from the smoothed shear field .",
    "the likelihood function of the estimated probability distribution of the source ellipticities is maximized for a set of model parameters , given a functional form of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution measured for faint galaxies .",
    "the entire inversion procedure to solve the lensing equation is performed for each cluster within the lenstool utilities . using a well - determined ` strong lensing ' model for the inner - regions of the clusters along with the averaged shear field and assuming a known functional form for @xmath41 from the field",
    ", the likelihood for a guessed model is computed using : @xmath42 for each faint galaxy @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the sum of the shear contribution from @xmath45 perturbers , and @xmath46 is the shear induced by the smooth component .",
    "@xmath47 we compute @xmath48 assigning the median redshift corresponding to the observed source magnitude for each arclet ( details of this procedure can be found in nk97 ) .",
    "the best fitting model parameters are then obtained by maximizing the log - likelihood function @xmath49 with respect to the chosen set of model parameters ( @xmath50 ) and the cluster parameters are simultaneously matched in an iterative way .",
    "for our analysis we select clusters at @xmath51 for which deep , high - quality _ hst _ imaging is available and which contain spectroscopically - confirmed multiply - imaged high redshift galaxies .",
    "these lensed features are essential to construct a detailed mass distribution for the cluster cores ( e.g.  kneib et al .",
    "1996 ; smith et al.2001a ) , while the existence of spectroscopic redshifts allows us to calibrate these mass distributions onto an absolute scale .",
    "this selection yields five clusters with redshifts spanning @xmath520.58 for our analysis : a2218 , a2390 , cl2244@xmath5302 , cl0024 + 16 , and cl0054@xmath5327 .",
    "in addition to these five clusters , we also include our previous analysis of the @xmath54 cluster ac114 ( nkse98 ) .",
    "details of the cluster properties are given in table  1  clearly these clusters do not constitute a well - defined sample , for example their x - ray luminosities span an order of magnitude and their central mass densities show a similarly large dispersion .",
    "it is this latter property which is of most interest for our analysis  and the large range spanned by the sample therefore provides a powerful test of the variation in characteristics of galaxy halos with local environment .",
    "the five new clusters were observed with _ wfpc2 _ , four through the f814w ( @xmath55 ) passband , with a2218 imaged in f702w ( @xmath56 ) , the total exposure times are listed in table  1 .",
    "these typically comprise stacks of multiple single - orbit ( 2.12.7ks ) exposures , each of which is spatially offset by an integer number of _ wfc _ pixels to allow the removal of cosmic - rays and other artifacts .",
    "the data were pipeline processed by stsci and combined using standard stsdas and iraf routines . for more details of the reduction see : a2218 , kneib et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; a2390 , pell et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; cl0024 + 16 and cl0054@xmath5327 , smail et al .",
    "these fields reach typical 5-@xmath4 detection limits for point sources of @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "object catalogs and attendent shape information for faint galaxies are obtained using the sextractor package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) and detection criteria of 12 _ wfc _ pixels above the @xmath59 or @xmath60magarcsec@xmath61 isophote after convolution with a 0.3@xmath62 diameter top - hat filter .",
    "selection of the background galaxies in these images employs a simple magnitude cut as previously used by nkse98 , either @xmath6326 or @xmath6425.5  this provides catalogs of typically @xmath65400 faint galaxies in each field .",
    "the magnitude limits employed should select field galaxies at median redshifts of @xmath66 , well beyond the clusters .",
    "visual morphological classifications of the brighter galaxies in these fields , used to select the early - type cluster galaxies , comes from smail et al .",
    "( 1997 , 2001 ) .",
    "in addition to the strong lens model of ac114 employed by nkse98 , lens models for three of the other clusters have been published previously : a2218 , kneib et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; a2390 , pell et al.(1999 ) ; cl0024 + 16 , smail et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . for the remaining two lenses cl2244@xmath5302 and cl0054@xmath5327",
    ", we construct well constrained mass models .",
    "the mass distribution in cl2244@xmath5302 has significant substructure , with the main clump centered around the brightest cluster galaxy with a velocity dispersion of @xmath67 kms@xmath8 , an ellipticity of @xmath68 and the secondary clump offset about 20 arcseconds away with a velocity dispersion of @xmath69 kms@xmath8 and an ellipticity of @xmath70 .",
    "the cluster cl0054@xmath5327 by contrast has a smooth , but extended mass distribution ( with a cut - off radius of about @xmath71 kpc ) with a central velocity dispersion of @xmath72 kms@xmath8 and an ellipticity of @xmath73 .",
    "before discussing the results , we describe the various tests we have employed to confirm their reliability . in order to check the authenticity of the signal",
    "the following null tests were performed in the likelihood analysis for every cluster : ( i ) randomizing the positions of the background galaxies , ( ii ) randomizing the orientations of the background galaxies , and ( iii ) scrambling the positions of cluster galaxies .",
    "no significant maxima were obtained in the likelihood prescription for any of these tests in any of the clusters . to quantify the errors on our derived parameters we note that the principal sources of error in the above analysis are ( i ) shot noise",
    " we are inherently limited by the finite number of sources sampled within a few tidal radii of each lensing cluster galaxy ( in the present analysis we typically have 40 cluster members and @xmath74 background sources ) ; ( ii ) the spread in the intrinsic ellipticity distribution of the source population ; ( iii ) the unknown source redshifts and ( iv ) observational errors arising from uncertainties in the measurement of ellipticities from the images for the faintest objects . from simulations where the detailed mass distribution of clusters is known ,",
    "we have calibrated the sources of error and find that of the above - mentioned four factors , shot noise ( accounts typically for @xmath75 of the incurred error ) and the unknown redshifts for individual background galaxies ( contributes @xmath7630% depending on the redshift of the cluster ) dominate the error budget .",
    "the remaining @xmath77 of the error budget arises due to inaccuracies in the measurement of shapes .",
    "we show in fig .  1 the likelihood contours for the galaxy perturber models of each of the five clusters . in all cases",
    "we detect an unambiguous galaxy - galaxy lensing signal at the @xmath783-@xmath4 level  confirming the existence of truncated dark halos associated with early - type galaxies in clusters .",
    "the likelihood analysis yields best - fit model parameters : @xmath79 the central velocity dispersion and truncation radius @xmath80 for a typical @xmath5 cluster member , these values are listed in table  1 .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios quoted here take passive evolution of the stellar content of elliptical / s0 galaxies into account modeled using the stellar population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "we have statistically extracted characteristic parameters for typical @xmath5 cluster galaxies that inhabit massive , dense lensing cluster - lenses ranging in redshift from 0.170.58 . this has been achieved by combining strong and weak lensing _",
    "observations in conjunction with an assumed parametric mass model .",
    "we find that the inferred mass distribution of a fiducial @xmath5 is extremely compact , although the inferred @xmath80 s lie well outside the optical radii and correspond to roughly between 5@xmath81 .",
    "our analysis also shows that the halos of individual cluster galaxies contribute at most 1020% of the total mass of the cluster within the central 1mpc , covered by the _",
    "_ _ wfpc2 _ imaging using the results of our likelihood analysis alongwith the best - fit paramters that characterize the smooth clump .",
    "therefore , in the inner regions of these clusters the bulk of the dark matter is in fact smoothly distributed .",
    "similar lensing studies of field galaxies , e.g.wilson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , typically find a non - zero signal for the radially averaged stacked tangential shear out to 200kpc . in contrast",
    "our study of the halos of galaxies in clusters detects a finite @xmath80 , which we attribute to the tidal truncation induced by the motion of these cluster galaxies inside the potential well . from the contours in the likelihood plots ,",
    "the presence of field galaxy scale dark halos can , in fact , be excluded at @xmath6-@xmath4 significance .",
    "the clusters we study here are all rich systems spanning a range in central density , which may explain why the best - fit values of @xmath80 obtained vary by a factor of 23 . to test this suggestion we plot in fig .",
    "2 the variation of the central density of the cluster dark matter with @xmath82 based on our lens models and evaluated at the cluster core radius .",
    "we see a good correlation and derive a best - fit slope of @xmath83 .",
    "this compares well with the theoretical expected value from a tidal stripping model ( merritt 1983 ) of @xmath84 : @xmath85    dark halos of the scale detected here indicate a high probability of galaxy encounters over a hubble time within a rich cluster .",
    "however , since the internal velocity dispersions of these cluster galaxies ( @xmath86kms@xmath8 ) are much smaller than their orbital velocities , these interactions are unlikely to lead to mergers , suggesting that the encounters of the kind simulated in the ` galaxy harassment ' picture ( moore et al .",
    "1996 ) are frequent and likely .",
    "in fact , high resolution cosmological n - body simulations of cluster formation and evolution ( ghigna et al .  1998 ; moore et al.1996 ) , find that the dominant interactions are between the global cluster tidal field and individual galaxies after @xmath87 .",
    "the cluster tidal field significantly tidally strips galaxy halos in the inner @xmath88mpc and the radial extent of the surviving halos is a strong function of their distance from the cluster center .",
    "much of this modification is found to occur between @xmath890 .",
    "detailed comparison of these results with tidal stripping of dark matter halos in cosmological n - body simulations will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the prospects for extending this technique to larger scales within clusters in order to study the efficiency of halo stripping as a function of radius ( variation of @xmath80 as a function of radius ) and morphological type are very promising with new instruments such as the _ advanced camera for survey _ on _ hst_. multi - band imaging will enable photometric redshift determination for the background sources which will reduce one of the significant sources of noise for future analyses .",
