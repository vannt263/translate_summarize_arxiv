    "in ordinary language , ",
    "network \" often carries the implication of being connected , so it is ironic the the two most classical models for ( infinite ) random spatial networks are not connected .",
    "these are    \\(i ) [ _ random geometric graph",

    "models @xcite ] .",
    "start with the usual square grid of vertices and edges ; add extra edges @xmath10 with probability @xmath11 for prescribed @xmath12 .",
    "however this third class of models is designed for settings where the relevant notion of path - length is  number of edges in the path \" .",
    "we will be concerned with the  purely geometric \" setting where the notion of _ route length _ is  sum of euclidean lengths of edges in the route \" , so there is a _ network distance _ between any two vertices , defined as the minimum ( over all routes connecting the vertices ) route length . in contexts where",
    "networks are designed to be connected and network distance is a topic of interest , using mathematical models which are not _ a priori _ connected is both conceptually unsatisfying and technically complicated , in that one is forced to consider quantities such as  mean network distance conditioned on the two vertices being in the unique infinite component \" .",
    "this paper is a technical contribution to a program ( see @xcite for a survey ) studying connected networks on random points , where we view the infinite poisson process as proxy for a large finite unstructured set of points .",
    "the main result concerns the very general class of _ cidrpp _ networks that we will now specify , after apologizing for the ugly name , and after mentioning a terminological convention we find helpful . visualizing road networks , we write _ city _ and _ road _ and _ route _ for the objects in a network model we are studying ; and write _ vertex ( site ) _ and _ edge _ and _ path _ for mathematical graphical objects constructed in the course of the proofs .    the _ pp _ denotes poisson process , precisely the rate 1 per unit area poisson point process used as the model for city positions .",
    "the _ dr _ denotes _ deterministic rule _ for roads ; given the configuration of cities , whether or not a straight road links the two cities is determined by some deterministic rule , which need not be  local \" ( it may depend on the entire configuration ) but is required only to be invariant ( _ i _ ) under translation .",
    "( note that using simple _ random _ rules would tend to leave some cities isolated and hence disconnect the network ) .",
    "the resulting idrpp network is a translation- invariant process in the plane , and the  random geometric graph \" in ( i ) is perhaps the simplest example .",
    "finally we want the network to be connected ( _ c _ ) , and adding that requirement gives the class of cidrpp networks . the best known example is perhaps the delaunay triangulation @xcite on the pp ; another example is the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) on the pp ( see section [ sec - mst ] ) .",

    "this particular network is interesting because ( loosely speaking ) it is the sparsest connected graph that can be defined by a simple local rule ; more precisely ( see section [ sec - discuss ] ) there is a family of _ proximity graphs _ which are supergraphs of the rng , and therefore can only have shorter network distances .",
    "the examples above are planar graphs , for which the notion of _ route _ is unambiguous .",
