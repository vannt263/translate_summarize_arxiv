    "the two - dimensional graphene - like lattice with intrinsic spin - orbit coupling has been identified as a paradigmatic example of qshi  @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit helical interaction , described by a nearest - neighbor spin - dependent complex hopping , opens a gap in the otherwise linear spectrum of the honeycomb lattice and at the same time induces a metallic behavior on the edges .",
    "a band gap opening , the _ conditio sine qua non _ for the emergence of topological features , can be achieved  at least conceptually  in different ways , not all of them with the same topological consequences .",

    "another interesting hopping modulation is the one leading to a kekul distortion where stronger and weaker nearest - neighbor links alternate on the honeycomb lattice in a @xmath2 arrangement .",
    "this structure turns out to be stable in the presence of nearest - neighbor and next - to - nearest - neighbor _ e - e _ interactions  @xcite resulting , at the mean field level , in an effective bond dimerization of a kekul type .    in this work",
    ", we explore the combined effects of spin - orbit couplings , hopping modulation and on - site _ e - e _ interaction .",
    "we superimpose different kinds of hopping modulation on a kane - mele - hubbard model  @xcite describing a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice in the presence of both spin - orbit coupling and local _ e - e _ interaction and we identify the topological properties of this interacting system in terms of topological invariants .",
    "this will be done by solving the many - body problem within cluster perturbation theory ( cpt ) and extracting topological invariants from the many - body green s function .",
    "the goal is to clarify how the topological phases that stem from the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling are modified by different kinds of hopping texturing and by _ e - e _ interaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec1 ] we consider non - interacting electrons in the presence of intrinsic spin - orbit coupling and different kinds of hopping modulation ; section [ sec2 ] extends the results to the interacting case , and the last section is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "in the present section we consider a honeycomb model of non - interacting electrons represented by a single particle hamiltonian with a spin - dependent hopping term @xmath3 here @xmath4 run over the atomic positions within the unit cell , @xmath5 refer to lattice vectors identifying the unit cells of the lattice , and _",

    "this hamiltonian preserves time - reversal symmetry and parity symmetry . in turn",
    ", this implies that  by kramer s theorem  states come in time - reversal pairs and the chern number computed from the bulk occupied bands identically vanishes , and so does the charge conductivity .",
    "however the spin - conductivity may be non - vanishing as it depends upon the difference between the two spin - filtered chern numbers  @xcite .",
    "we start by considering the modulation in the hopping amplitudes among nearest - neighboring sites that may arise as a consequence of a non - uniform shear strain . as shown in ref .",

    "different values of second neighbor interactions are indicated.,width=321 ]    since the system has time - reversal and inversion symmetry we may identify the topological character of the system through the @xmath15 parity invariant defined as the exponent @xmath16 in the expression @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the parity eigenvalues of the occupied bands for any of the two spin sectors , calculated at time - reversal invariant momenta ( trim ) , and @xmath19 is defined by the condition that @xmath20 with @xmath21 a reciprocal lattice vector .",

    ", these quantities depend just on first near- est neighbor hopping parameters and not on second nearest neighbor hoppings describing spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this is a direct consequence of symmetry : each site in the unit cell is connected to 3 pairs of second nearest neighbors sharing the same distance but placed in opposite directions ( sites 1 - 2 , 3 - 4 , 5 - 6 in fig .",
    "[ geo ] ) .",
    "for this reason the hamiltonian matrix @xmath28 at any trim point does not depend on haldane - kane - mele second - neighbor spin - orbit coupling .",

    "the values where a phase transition occurs  either between qshi and topologically trivial insulator ( tti ) for @xmath33 or between semimetal and tti for @xmath32are identical and the phase diagram that we obtain ( fig .",

    "we stress again that the spin - orbit term , even including a modulation in second - neighbor hopping interaction , does not alter the parity symmetry ( @xmath45 ) and as such it does not affect the gap position in k - space .",
    "after the transition the gap remains at m.    we turn now to the kekul distortion . in this case",
    "the unit cell contains six atoms , with alternating values in the nearest - neighbor hopping parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 as shown in fig .",

    "we have two possible values of the second nearest - neighbor parameters ; since their dependence on the lattice deformation is not easy to assess we have considered two separate cases , namely @xmath48 and @xmath49 as suggested in ref .  .",
    "neglecting at first the variation in the second nearest - neighbor hopping parameters we notice that the minimum separation between filled and empty states is , for any value of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , pinned at a @xmath52 point .",
    "this is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ kekule0 ] where the dispersion of the highest occupied band is shown for different values of @xmath50 and for @xmath53 .",
