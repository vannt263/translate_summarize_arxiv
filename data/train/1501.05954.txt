    "one of the most prominent characteristics of the ultraviolet ( uv ) , optical , and near - infrared ( nir ) spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is the presence of broad emission lines .",
    "while we know that these features arise on scales not much larger than the accretion disk , their physical nature remains one of the major unsolved mysteries in agn astrophysics .",
    "a particularly important feature of the broad emission lines is that they are , by definition , resolved in line - of - sight ( los ) velocity , and their large widths leave little doubt that the primary broadening mechanism is differential doppler shifts due to the motion of individual gas clouds , filaments , or more - or - less continuous flows around the central black hole",
    ".    however , it is not possible to establish the broad - line region ( blr ) kinematics simply by inverting the line profiles because this inverse problem is degenerate , with a wide variety of simple velocity models providing satisfactory fits ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the existing evidence on the blr kinematics is ambiguous : some of this gas may flow inward , helping to feed the central black hole .",
    "extended , flattened , rotating disk - like structures seem to be important in at least some blrs , as shown statistically for radio - loud agns @xcite , by the pronounced double - peaked profiles observed in some sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and from spectropolarimetry @xcite .",
    "there is evidence of the importance of the black hole gravity in dominating the motion of the blr gas @xcite , although radiation pressure may also play a role @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , developments over the last two decades re - open the interesting possibility that much of the emitting blr gas is due to outflowing winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whose kinematics and energetics are also poorly understood .",
    "the unknown dynamics of the blr gas represents a serious gap in our understanding of agns and in the calibrations needed for the study of black - hole / host - galaxy co - evolution up to very high redshifts .",
    "there have been many attempts to model the physics of the blr .",
    "in general , photoionization equilibrium models can reproduce the line intensities , but self - consistent models that provide simultaneous solutions to the line intensities , profiles , and variability are lacking .",
    "the locally optimally emitting cloud model @xcite and the stratified cloud model @xcite explain most observed line intensities and some of the observed time lags between the continuum and emission lines .",
    "however , they lack the important kinematic ingredients required to explain the observed line profiles .      in order to understand the structure and kinematics of the blr",
    ", we must break the degeneracy that comes from the study of the line profiles alone .",
    "we can do this by using reverberation mapping ( rm ) to determine how gas at various los velocities responds to continuum variations as a function of light travel - time delay @xcite .    over the last quarter century , the rm technique has become a standard tool for investigating the blr . in its simplest form , rm is used to determine the mean time delay between continuum and emission - line variations , typically by cross - correlation of the respective light curves .",
    "it is assumed that this represents the mean light - travel time across the blr . by combining this with the emission - line width , which is assumed to reflect the velocity dispersion of gas whose motions",
    "are dominated by the mass of the central black hole , the black hole mass can be estimated .",
    "rm in this form has been used to measure the black hole masses in over 50 agns ( for a recent compilation , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to a typical accuracy of @xmath8dex .",
    "important findings that have arisen from these rm studies include the following :    1 .   in a given agn ,",
    "emission lines that are characteristic of higher - ionization gas respond more rapidly to continuum flux variations than those characteristic of lower - ionization gas , indicating ionization stratification within the blr @xcite .",
    "2 .   there is an inverse correlation between the time delay , or lag @xmath9 , for a particular emission line and the doppler width @xmath10 of that emission line .",
    "the relationship for a given agn is consistent with the virial prediction @xmath11 @xcite . without this relationship",
    ", rm masses would be highly dubious .",
    "there is an empirical relationship between the agn luminosity @xmath12 and the radius of the blr @xmath13 ( hereafter the @xmath13@xmath12 relationship ) that is well - established only for the h@xmath14  emission line @xcite .",
    "limited data on civ@xmath15 indicates a similar relationship applies to that line as well @xcite .",
    "the existence of @xmath13@xmath12 relationships for both low - ionization and high - ionization lines has been independently confirmed by gravitational microlensing observations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13@xmath12 relationship is of particular interest as it allows estimation of the central black - hole mass based on a single spectrum from which the line width is measured and the blr radius is inferred from the agn luminosity .",
    "this neatly bypasses the need for a direct rm measurement of the emission - line time lag .",
    "rm is necessarily resource intensive : even to determine the mean time delay for an emission line typically requires some 3050 well - spaced high - quality spectrophotometric observations or a good measure of luck for fewer observations .",
    "the @xmath13@xmath12 relationship is very important as the rm - based mass determinations anchor empirical scaling relationships ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "given the importance of the uv emission lines in the photoionization equilibrium of the blr gas and the probable differences between the geometry and kinematics of the high and low - ionization gas in the blr , we have undertaken a large rm program in the uv using the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ; @xcite ) on _ hst _  ( _ hst _  program go-13330 ) , the agn space telescope and optical reverberation mapping ( agn storm ) project , in the first half of 2014 .",

    "2 .   velocity  delay maps recovered using the uv continuum as the driving light curve ( equation [ eq : trans ] ) are expected to be of higher fidelity than those obtained from the optical continuum because the observable uv is closer in wavelength to the ionizing continuum ( @xmath30 ) that powers the emission lines .",
    "the optical continuum is not only a slightly time - delayed version of the uv continuum , but it seems smoothed somewhat as well @xcite , which might make it difficult to recover detailed structure in the velocity  delay maps .",
    "our _ hst _  program afforded a valuable opportunity for exploring agn behavior at high time resolution for an extended period at wavelengths beyond those covered by our _ hst _",

    "the _ swift _ satellite @xcite is especially suitable for such a study because of its broad wavelength coverage ( hard x - ray through @xmath31-band ) and ability to execute high - cadence observations over an extended period of time . in paper ii , we present the results of a four - month program of high - cadence ( approximately twice per day ) multiwavelength observations with _ swift_. additional papers in this series will describe high - cadence ground - based photometry from the near uv through the nir .",
    "we will also present results from a program of ground - based spectroscopy that is similar in cadence to the _",

    "we describe our initial data analysis and results in section 3 , and in section 4 , we briefly discuss the first results from our program and place these results in the context of previous monitoring campaigns on ngc 5548 .",
    "when necessary , we assume a @xmath32cdm cosmology with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "rm is a resource - intensive activity that requires obtaining high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath36 ) homogeneous spectra at sufficiently high spectral resolution to resolve the gross kinematics of the blr .",
    "spectra must be obtained at a high cadence over a temporal baseline that is longer than the typical variability timescale of the agn .",
    "given the inherent risks of rm programs due to the unpredictability of agn variability , it is essential that our experimental design assures a successful outcome , yet is as economical with observing time as possible .",
    "the first consideration is that each epoch of observation should require no more than one _ hst _",
    "orbit per `` visit '' which restricts the integration time per visit to @xmath37 minutes .",
    "this consideration limits us to relatively bright nearby seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "cos is clearly the instrument of choice for such a project , as it is a very sensitive , high spectral resolution spectrometer .",
    "its native resolution ( @xmath38 ) is high enough to allow us to trade off resolution and @xmath36 in the data processing phase . in order to schedule the observatory efficiently ,",
    "a cadence of one visit per day or longer is required .",
    "we therefore want to target an agn that has a civ - emitting region several light days in extent , and this requires a source with @xmath39 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this led us immediately to select as a target the well - studied seyfert 1 galaxy ngc5548 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "ngc5548 is probably the best - studied agn by rm , with historical optical spectroscopy extending as far back as the early 1970s @xcite .",
    "importantly , it has never been known to go into a `` dormant state , '' as observed recently in the case of mrk 590 @xcite , that would preclude a successful reverberation campaign and , historically , self - absorption in the uv resonance lines has been minimal @xcite , although strong absorption appeared in 2013 @xcite .",
    "the remaining adjustable parameter is the duration of the campaign .",
    "we investigated this using monte carlo simulations similar to those described by @xcite . using recent developments in statistically modeling agn light curves @xcite",
    ", we can make very robust models of the expected continuum behavior of ngc 5548 .",
    "quasar light curves are well - described by a stochastic process , the damped random walk .",
    "the process is described by an amplitude @xmath41 and a damping timescale @xmath42 , which for ngc 5548 in the optical are measured to be @xmath43 and @xmath44 days , respectively @xcite .",
    "we used these measured properties of ngc 5548 to simulate the continuum variations ; this is a conservative choice as the uv continuum can be expected to show both higher amplitude and shorter time - scale variations , both of which are an advantage .",
    "we then convolved the artificial light curves with model velocity ",
    "delay maps for several lines to provide an artificial spectrum .",
    "as described by @xcite , we adopted a blr model with an extremely challenging velocity ",
    "delay map for these simulations , a keplerian disk with a single two - armed spiral density wave .",
    "while this is unlikely to be the actual agn blr geometry , it provides a challenging test : if we can recover such a complex velocity  delay map correctly , then we can certainly hope to recover others of comparable complexity and would have no difficulties with geometries like those that have been recovered for optical lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we modeled the emissivity and response of each line realistically using a grid of photoionization equilibrium models @xcite .",

    "simulations based on characteristics of previous rm experiments yield velocity  delay maps with noise levels similar to those obtained from the actual data , demonstrating the verisimilitude of our simulations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for examples ) .",
    "the goal of our simulations was to determine the minimum duration program that would allow us to recover a velocity  delay map with a high probability of success .",
    "for cos - like observations ( in terms of @xmath36 per visit and spectral resolution ) , our initial simulations indicated that reliable velocity  delay map recovery for a strong line ( e.g. , civ ) required between 130 to 200 days .",
    "a finer grid of models showed that in 10 of 10 simulations , a high - fidelity velocity  delay map was recovered after 180 days , which was thus adopted as the program goal . a much longer program at this sampling rate",
    "would in any case be precluded by the accessibility of the target to _",
    "hst_.    because of the long duration of the proposed program , we also considered the possible impact of losses of data due to instrument or spacecraft safing events .",
    "short safing events occur frequently enough that we needed to assess their impact . based on the record for _ hst_and cos in cycles 1720",
    ", there might be two spacecraft events that lose 23 days each and one cos event that loses 2 days over a stretch of 180 consecutive days . by repeating a subset of our simulations",
    ", we found that losses of such small numbers of observations would have no impact on our ability to recover the velocity ",
    "delay maps .",
    "the simulations also allowed us to assess the impact of early termination of our experiment due to a major failure .",
    "if a program was terminated at @xmath45 days , the probability that the data would yield a useful ( but not a detailed ) velocity  delay map would be @xmath46% .",
    "however , a program as short as 75 days would have a very low probability ( @xmath47% ) of success .",
    "the key to a successful rm campaign is that it must be long enough that favorable continuum variability characteristics become highly probable .",
    "that this is essentially guaranteed to happen during a 180-day experiment played a major role in selecting ngc 5548 as our target .",
    "observations were made in single - orbit _ hst _  cos visits approximately daily from 2014 february 1 through july 27 .",
    "of the 179 scheduled visits , 171 observations were executed successfully and 8 were lost to safing events or target acquisition failures ( very close to the expected number of losses ) .    in each visit",
    ", we used the g130 m and g160 m gratings to observe the uv spectrum over the range 11531796  in four separate exposures .",
    "exposure times were selected to provide @xmath48 when measured over velocity bins of @xmath49 . during each visit , we obtained two 200-second exposures with g130 m centered at 1291  and 1327  and two 590-second exposures with g160 m centered at 1600  and 1623 .    the cos far - ultraviolet detector is a windowless , crossed delay - line microchannel plate stack that is subject to long - term charge depletion . to extend the useful lifetime of the detector , we positioned the spectrum so that bright geocoronal airglow lines ( e.g. , ly@xmath50 ) and agn emission lines ( e.g. , redshifted ly@xmath3 ) would not always fall on the same area of the detector .",
    "first , we alternated the target acquisition between the g130m/1291 and the g130m/1327 configurations .",
    "the g130m/1327 configuration is then followed by a g130m/1327/fp - pos=3 exposure , and by a g130m/1291 exposure alternating among fp - pos=1 , 2 , and 4 .",
    "the g130m/1291 configuration is instead followed by a g130m/1291/fp - pos=3 exposure , and by a g130m/1327 exposure alternating among fp - pos=1 , 2 , and 4 .",
    "second , we alternated the fp - pos for the g160m/1623 exposure between fp - pos=1 and fp - pos=2 .",
    "we could not vary the settings for the g160m/1600 and g160m/1623 further because we needed to ensure the coverage of the entire wavelength range while keeping the detector gap from falling on the redshifted civ@xmath15 emission line .",
    "finally , we used four additional orbits to improve our understanding of the cos flux calibrations ( see section [ sec_data_reduction ] ) . during these additional visits , we observed two of the standard stars ( wd 0308565 and wd 1057 + 719 ) employed to obtain sensitivity functions @xcite at the same detector locations we used for the reverberation program .",
    "the observations were taken using all the instrument configurations employed in our primary observing program .",
    "we used the calcos pipeline v2.21 for the bulk of our data processing .",
    "the absolute flux calibration of the cos reduction pipeline is reported to be accurate to @xmath51 and the relative flux calibration is good to better than @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "we are primarily interested in the quality of the relative flux calibration as we are looking for very small - scale variations on short timescales ; we need the fluxes to be stable and repeatable across the spectrum .",
    "we found , however , that there were local variations in the precision of the fluxes that necessitated improvements .    to produce a final dataset with a flux calibration that is everywhere precise at the 2% level , we refined the existing calibration reference files and applied a post - calcos pipeline to further process the data .",
    "the main areas of improvement include refinements to the dispersion solution , fixed - pattern noise mitigation , the sensitivity function , and the time dependent sensitivity ( tds ) functions , as outlined below .",
    "the final data product consists of one combined spectrum per grating per day .",
    "airglow emission lines ( oi@xmath53 and ni@xmath54 ) were filtered from the data by removing events detected when _ hst _  was in daylight .",
    "the spectra were further binned by 4 pixels in order to increase the @xmath36 per spectral element of the agn continuum .",
    "this binning still results in two binned pixels per cos resolution element .",
    "the cos wavelength solution has a quoted uncertainty of @xmath55kms@xmath56 @xcite .",

    "to accomplish this , we cross - correlated the line profiles of strong interstellar medium absorption features between each cos observation and the stis reference spectrum .",
    "we used 19 interstellar absorption features , ranging from siii@xmath58 at the short - wavelength end to alii@xmath59 at the long - wavelength end . a linear correction to the initial wavelength solution was then computed across each detector segment and applied directly to the extracted spectra . with this correction",
    ", measurements of the root mean square ( rms ) of the residual offsets decreased from @xmath55kms@xmath56 to @xmath60kms@xmath56 .",
    "the standard reference files used in the calcos pipeline correct for only the most prominent fixed - pattern noise features such as the quantum - efficiency gridwires , low - order response variations , and large geometric distortion artifacts @xcite .",
    "usually , users combine multiple fp - pos positions to smooth over the remaining features . however , this was not possible for our dataset , since only a single fp - pos setting was used for each central wavelength setting in each orbit ( see section [ sec_cos_observations ] ) .    to correct these features to a higher degree we derived one - dimensional pixel - to - pixel flats ( `` p - flats '' ) .",
    "these flats were produced by combining normalized , high signal - to - noise ratio white dwarf spectra in detector space , following the method described by @xcite . the white dwarf spectra used were taken as part of the _ hst_/cal program 12806 ( pi : maasa ) and used the same detector locations as used for the ngc  5548 datasets .    to test the effects of our p - flat correction , we combined the 171 spectra reduced both with and without the application of the p - flats .",
    "the _ s / n _ per pixel in 5  continuum regions increased from @xmath61 to @xmath62 for the g130 m grating , and from @xmath63 to @xmath64@xmath65 for the g160 m grating through the removal of small localized flux calibration errors by the p - flat correction .",
    "the improvement for the g130 m combined spectrum is less dramatic because ( a ) we rotated among the four fp - pos settings , and ( b ) the g130 m grating disperses more widely in the cross - dispersion direction , and thus intrinsically averages the fixed - pattern noise over a larger area of the detector .",
    "the cos flux calibration is done in two steps : ( a ) derivation of static sensitivity functions and ( b ) characterization of the time evolution of the sensitivity through the tds correction @xcite .",
    "thanks to the existing calibration program that monitors the tds variations ( pid 13520 ) , we had bi - monthly observations of the standard star wd  0308565 for 3 out of the 4 central wavelength settings we are using in our program ( g130m/1291 , g130m/1327 and g160m/1623 ) .",
    "standard star data were obtained in 2014 february , april , june , and august . by analyzing these calibration data , together with the data collected during our additional calibration orbits ( section [ sec_cos_observations ] )",
    ", we verified that both the static and time - dependent response functions vary more with instrument configuration than currently modeled by the calcos pipeline .",
    "while calcos assumes that both the sensitivity function and the tds correction vary only as a function of wavelength , we were able to improve the relative flux calibrations and reach our required level of precision by ( a ) obtaining sensitivity functions individually for each configuration ( one function per wavelength setting per fp - pos per detector segment ) , and ( b ) computing the tds correction individually for each wavelength setting observed as part of the routine calibration program .",
    "we estimate the quality of the flux calibration by inspection of the fractional residuals @xmath66 of the calibrated standard star spectra and their respective calspec stellar model ( the same models employed by the standard pipeline reference file ) , @xmath67 where both @xmath68 and @xmath69 are binned over 1using a boxcar filter in order to increase the _ s / n _ per spectral element .",
    "while the visual inspection of the residuals as a function of wavelength allows us to identify and correct for local biases , we use the mean value of the distribution of the residuals as an indicator of a global bias in the calibration .",
    "the flux calibration uncertainty is an estimate of the limit of the stability of the flux calibration at a given time .",
    "however , since the overall instrument sensitivity evolves with time , and our final spectra are obtained from the combination of multiple settings for each grating , we conservatively define the fractional precision error @xmath70 for each grating as the maximum fractional uncertainty computed for any of the wavelength settings .",
    "the new sensitivity functions were derived from spectra of the standard star wd  0308565 for the g130 m settings , and of wd  1057 + 719 for the g160 m settings ( pid 12806 ) . while one individual sensitivity function per detector segment characterizes the full grating ( data from different settings are averaged together ) in calcos , we built one independent sensitivity function for each wavelength setting and fp - pos used in our program .    by comparing the bi - monthly wd  0308565 data , we found that residuals with respect to the stellar models were greatly reduced if the tds corrections were computed individually for each of the wavelength settings ( g130m/1291 , g130m/1327 and g160m/1623 ) , instead of averaging the data over multiple modes .",
    "additional improvements were obtained by increasing the number of time intervals over which the tds trends are computed and by redefining the wavelength ranges used in the analysis .",
    "unfortunately , there are insufficient calibration data for the longest wavelengths in the g160 m spectra , so we were forced to truncate these spectra at 1750 .    in spite of these improvements",
    ", the available data did not allow us to conduct any tests on the remaining setting ( g160m/1600 ) .",
    "this setting is particularly important for our scientific goals since it includes most of the broad civ  emission line ( section [ section : introstorm ] ) .",
    "moreover , since all the calibration data for tds monitoring purposes are obtained only using fp - pos=3 , they did not allow us to test for any residual dependence of the tds correction on fp - pos configuration .",
    "these are the two reasons that motivated us to request further calibration data ( see section [ sec_cos_observations ] ) . these data for wd  0308565 and wd  1057 + 719 collected in 2014 september allowed us to derive an independent set of sensitivity functions .",
    "by comparing the new sensitivity functions with the originals , appropriately corrected for time evolution of the tds , we were able :    1 .   to identify the best possible tds correction attainable for the g160m/1600 setting with the current tds calibration data .",
    "the current calcos tds correction for this configuration was obtained from combining both g160m/1577 and g160m/1623 data .",
    "although this correction is not ideal , it minimizes both the global bias and the flux calibration uncertainty when compared to the tds corrections obtained individually from either the g160m/1577 or the g160m/1623 settings .",
    "2 .   to verify that the tds correction does not vary strongly with fp - pos settings . while comparing the residuals with respect to the stellar models shows structure unique to each fp - pos setting , the level of the local biases is such that both the global bias and the flux calibration uncertainty can be considered stable for each wavelength setting ( the maximum deviation in the width of the residual distribution is @xmath71 ) .    with the new flux calibration and tds characterization , our global biases are consistent with zero and",
    "the overall fractional precision is @xmath72% and @xmath73 , respectively , for the g130 m and g160 m settings , compared to @xmath74 for the standard pipeline .",
    "we intend to make these improvements available to other cos users .      during the final week of the observing campaign , the operating high voltage ( hv ) for one of the cos detector segments",
    "was increased to combat the negative effects of `` gain - sag '' @xcite . while necessary to provide well - calibrated data , this hv change also has the effect of introducing small changes in the detector response .",
    "using wd  0308565 observations from our calibration orbits taken at the same hv as the rest of the campaign and contemporaneous tds monitoring observations of the same calibration target ( taken at the increased hv ) , we were able to estimate a hv bias correction for the g130 m grating from a direct comparison of the spectra .",
    "this bias was measured to be 1% without any detectable dependence on wavelength or cenwave setting .",
    "unfortunately , the same procedure could not be done for the g160 m grating as our additional orbits and the tds observations used different standard stars ( wd  0308565 instead of wd  1057 + 719 ) . instead ,",
    "the bias estimate for this grating was obtained by analyzing the time evolution of the mean flux in overlapping regions of g130m/1327 at the lower hv setting and g160m/1600 at the higher hv setting .",
    "this analysis gave a plausible estimate of a 1% bias .",
    "however , with such a limited amount of data at the lower hv and a narrow overlapping wavelength range , the estimate lacks the accuracy of the g130 m bias estimate .",
    "for an initial look at the spectral variations , we define g130 m and g160 m mean spectra as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the @xmath77th spectrum of the series of @xmath78 spectra .",

    "the earliest high - quality uv spectra of ngc 5548 showed only weak absorption in the resonance lines ( ly@xmath3 , nv , siiv , and civ ) , a factor that contributed to our selection of ngc 5548 as a target for this investigation .",

    "to put the results reported here in context , we note that ngc5548 has been monitored in the uv for rm purposes on two previous occasions , as noted in section [ section : introrm ] . in 1989 , ngc5548 was observed once every four days for eight months with _ iue _  @xcite . in early 1993 ,",
    "it was observed every other day with _ iue _  for a period of two months , and during the latter part of that campaign , it was also observed daily for 39 days with the _ hst_faint object spectrograph @xcite .",
    "the primary goals of these two experiments were quite different : the 1989 campaign was the first massive coordinated rm experiment and it was designed to measure the mean lags for the strong uv lines . the 1993 campaign was a higher time - resolution experiment that was designed to eliminate ambiguities from the 1989 campaign .",
    "specifically , its goals were :    1 .   to measure the lag of the most rapidly responding line , heii@xmath1 .",
    "2 .   to determine whether or not there is a lag between the uv and optical continuum variations . 3 .   to determine whether the wings and core of the civ  emission line have different lags .",
    "in addition to these rm programs , several _ hst _  cos spectra of ngc5548 were obtained in 2013 with the primary goal of studying absorption features in the uv as support for an intensive x - ray monitoring program undertaken with _",
    "xmm - newton _ @xcite .",
    "our own results on variable absorption features constitute an extension of that effort and will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "again , for broader context , during the agn storm campaign ngc5548 was at about the same mean continuum luminosity as it was during the 1989 campaign ( but with a somewhat lower amplitude of variability ) , somewhat brighter than in the 1993 campaign , and decidedly brighter than it was in 2013 , which was near the end of a lower - than - normal state that lasted several years @xcite .",
    "the resonance lines showed much more self - absorption in this campaign than in either the 1989 or 1993 observations , but less than seen in 2013 .",
    "the emission - line lags were somewhat larger during the 1989 campaign and the emission - line fluxes were higher , at least in part on account of much lower absorption in 1989 .",
    "the 1993 emission - line lags were similar to those obtained in this experiment , but again the line fluxes were larger , but less self - absorbed .",
    "as already noted , the response of the emission lines becomes complicated during the second half of the present campaign .",
    "the heii@xmath1 light curve seems to match the 1367continuum most closely ; this line responds primarily to continuum emission at @xmath247 , implying that the variations in the 1367  continuum provide a reasonable proxy for the behavior of the hydrogen - ionizing continuum ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "heii  arises closer to the central source than the other emission lines , and it is also the only non - resonance line .",
    "more detailed analysis will be undertaken once the heii@xmath21 and balmer - line results become available from our contemporaneous ground - based monitoring program @xcite .",
    "in addition to determining the geometry and kinematics of the blr , we also wish to use these data to improve on previous estimates of the mass of the central black hole .",
    "however , the strong absorption in the blue wings of the resonance lines , which was very weak if even present in the 1989 and 1993 campaigns , precludes using simple measurements of the rms spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to make a mass estimate .",
    "more detailed modeling that we hope will lead to a more accurate black hole mass will be undertaken in future papers .    to summarize briefly ,",
    "we have presented the first results from a uv spectroscopic rm study of ngc5548 undertaken with _ hst _",
    "cos in 2014 .",
    "we detect strong variations in the continuum and find clear delayed response of the strong emission lines , ly@xmath3 , nv , siiv , civ , and heii .",
    "a preliminary investigation shows that there is indeed a strong velocity - dependence of the emission - line lags , at least in the case of ly@xmath3  and civ , although blending and strong resonance absorption will make interpretation challenging .",
    "however , we have also shown that a heuristic multicomponent model can account for virtually all the spectral features . in future contributions",
    ", we will use this model as a starting point to explore the uv spectral variations in detail .",
    "we will also undertake a similar analysis of contemporaneous optical spectra in an effort to more completely understand the blr geometry and kinematics . in the accompanying paper ii",
    ", we combine the continuum light curve presented here with high - cadence observations with _ swift _ for a similar reverberation study of the accretion disk structure in ngc5548 .",

    "<S> velocity - resolved cross - correlation analysis shows coherent structure in lag versus line - of - sight velocity for the emission lines ; the high - velocity wings of civrespond to continuum variations more rapidly than the line core , probably indicating higher velocity blr clouds at smaller distances from the central engine . </S>",
