    "vector - like fermions help gauge coupling unification , but the lower unification scale is in conflict with proton decay constraints @xcite . a recent survey of phenomenological implications of vector - like extensions @xcite presents constraints from electroweak precision observables , direct collider searches , higgs production and decays .",
    "the couplings to the standard light ( and heavier ) fermions are severely constrained . to avoid flavour problems ( for flavour issues see @xcite ) and to ensure there is no mixing between sm and the new vector - like fermions a @xmath2 matter parity is introduced .",

    "the lightest new particle is stable and if it is electrically neutral then it provides a dark matter candidate .",
    "the singlet - doublet dark matter model is an effective theory or simplified version of the neutralino mssm dark matter sector .",
    "the mixing in the dark sector allows for a wide range of higgs and gauge boson couplings that is able to avoid direct detection in dark matter experiments and colliders and give the measured relic density , while still remaining a relatively simple model .",
    "the model contains four new parameters , two dimensionful mass parameters and two yukawa couplings , originally completely unconstrained .",
    "a recent analysis in @xcite has found combined bounds on the vector masses and the overall value of the yukawa coupling .",
    "the spectrum generally is a solution of a third order equation and the analytical treatment is difficult .",
    "another problem is that the four - dimensional parameter space can be only visualized if at least two parameters ( generally the yukawas ) are fixed . in @xcite",
    "the phenomenologically allowed regions of the parameter space have been found in the neighborhood of the blind spots , where the coupling of the dark matter candidate to @xmath0 or @xmath1 vanishes . in these special points",
