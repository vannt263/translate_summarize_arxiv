    "[ fig : luodipole ] it is clear that cooling through the nel transition has no significant influence on the local dipole moments of lumno@xmath2 .",
    "however , we have shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mnoip ] that the local environment around the mn ions does change . since the mn spins are @xcite , even above @xmath3 , the magnetic ordering transition at @xmath3 is expected to have the largest effect on the  mn@xmath48o bond lengths .",
    "the ferroelectricity on the other hand depends mostly on the lu@xmath48o bond lengths@xcite .",
    "although the oxygen ions involved are the same , o3 and o4 , the mn@xmath48o bond lengths change mostly by a displacement @xmath57 of the mn ion along the @xmath40 axis , whereas the  lu@xmath48o bond lengths change because of an opposite movement of the lu1 ( lu2 ) and o3(o4 ) ions along the @xmath7 axis .",
    "we conclude that there is no significant coupling between the ferroelectric moment of lumno@xmath2 and the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature .",

    "lattice parameter @xmath7 has a smaller increase of about 0.5% .",
    "we can clearly see from these data that the influence of @xmath21 is larger on the  lattice parameter than on the  lattice parameter .",
    "the crystal structure can be regarded as a stacking of hexagonally packed oxygen layers and a ion layers .",
    "one expects that o@xmath48o bond lengths are @xmath86  , ( @xmath87  ) and a@xmath48o bond lengths are @xmath82  , ( @xmath88  ) .",
    "for instance , in lamno@xmath2 the average o@xmath48o and la@xmath48o bond length ( in the fcc - like closed packed oo and ao layers ) is @xmath89  (@xmath90",
    "the observed values for the inter - plane a@xmath48o1 and a@xmath48o2 bond lengths in hexagonal amno@xmath2 ( not shown here ) are consistent with the expected values .",
    "likewise the observed increase with increasing @xmath21 of the a@xmath48o1 and a@xmath48o2 bond lengths ( on average 1.6% ) is in excellent agreement with the increase of @xmath31 with @xmath21 .",
    "we note that in hexagonal amno@xmath2 both the hexagonally packed o layers at @xmath91 and the mno layers at @xmath92 have intra - plane o@xmath48o distances of @xmath93   .",
    "similarly , the  a@xmath48a distances are also @xmath93   .",
    "this is in contrast with the intra - plane bond lengths in pseudo - cubic perovskites .",
    "these anomalously large `` bond lengths '' can be understood , by considering the way the layers are stacked .",
    "starting at the mno layer at @xmath94 , the stacking order is mno - o - a - o - mno with layer spacings of about @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath96 and @xmath95 .",
    "one can visualise that the a ion layer ( at @xmath97 ) is clamped between the closed packed o layer ( at @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "this will enlarge the spacing of the o and a ions in those layers .",
    "the larger the radius of the a ions , the more the o ions are pushed apart .",
    "however , the o@xmath48o bond length between the two neighbouring o layers at @xmath98 and @xmath99 is reduced to @xmath86   , which corresponds to the value one expects ( @xmath100 ) . in this simple model , changes in @xmath21",
    "can be accommodated completely by a change in the  bond lengths and lattice parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the decreasing distances in the @xmath4 plane with decreasing @xmath84 should also be reflected in the  mn@xmath48o bond lengths .",
    "the change of @xmath101 % is in good agreement with the observed change of @xmath31 with decreasing @xmath84 .",
    "possible changes in the  mn - o bonds are too small to be resolved within the scatter and error bars of the experiments .",

    "fig : ro ] .",
    "the short a1@xmath48o3 and a2@xmath48o4 bonds increase by 3.6% and 2.3% with increasing @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the `` extra long ''  a@xmath48o bond lengths should decrease with increasing @xmath21 , since @xmath7 is almost constant .",
    "consequently , the dipoles of the a polyhedra decrease with increasing @xmath21 .",
    "the increase in dipole moment from y ( @xmath102   ) to lu ( @xmath103   ) is about 10% as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r12dipole ] .",
    "the transition from the paraelectric centrosymmetric to the ferroelectric non - centrosymmetric structure consists of two atomic displacements .",
    "the first is the buckling of the mno@xmath5 network , displacing o1 and o2 in the @xmath13 plane and o3 and o4 along the @xmath29 axis .",
    "the second is the alternate displacement of the a1 and a2 ions along the @xmath29 axis away from the @xmath104  mirror plane@xcite .",
    "formally , it has been shown that these atomic displacements consist of two modes .",
    "firstly , there is a k@xmath105 mode , which changes the symmetry but can inherently not create a macroscopic ferroelectric moment .",
    "secondly , there is a @xmath106 mode , which does not change the space group symmetry , but introduces the macroscopic ferroelectricity@xcite . to see which of these two modes",
    "is influenced more by chemical substitution , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : r1o3pos ] the @xmath29 coordinates of the a1 and the o3 sites .",
    "both @xmath29 coordinates of a1 and o3 are about 0.02@xmath7 away from their centrosymmetric equilibrium position . clearly , the changes in the @xmath29 coordinate of o3 site are much larger than the changes in the @xmath29 coordinate of the a1 site . the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : r1o3pos ] therefore show that upon chemical substitution of the a site the buckling increases with decreasing @xmath21 , which results in an increase of the deviation from the centrosymmetric positions .",
    "the displacement of the a ions from the mirror plane is more or less constant .",
    "this is supported by the changes in the @xmath40 coordinates of the o1 and o2 sites .",
    "both are about 0.025@xmath31 off their symmetric position at @xmath41 and this deviation becomes larger by @xmath107 from r = y to r = lu .",
    "we conclude that the change in the local dipole moment is caused by atomic rearrangement and not by expansion of the unit cell .",
    "coordinates of the a1 and o3 position ( 0 , 0 , @xmath29 ) versus @xmath21 .",
    "clearly the @xmath29 coordinates deviate more from their equilibrium positions , respectively @xmath104 and @xmath94 , with decreasing @xmath21.,width=302 ]    the ferroelectric transition temperatures for these materials have been reported , but different authors report completely different values or only `` higher than '' values .",
    "furthermore , there are indications that the ferroelectric ordering temperature and the non - centrosymmetric to centrosymmetric phase transition temperature are different by several hundreds degrees@xcite .",
    "it is therefore not possible to relate the magnitude of the local dipole moments or the total dipole moment to the ferroelectric ordering temperature .",
    "the effect of changing @xmath21 can be summarised as follows .",
    "a decrease in @xmath21 will reduce the `` normal '' a@xmath48o bond lengths . this will change the  mn@xmath48o bond lengths too .",
    "these changes are accompanied by an increased buckling of the mno@xmath5 bipyramids , parameterised by @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath54 and @xmath108 .",
    "the changes in the oxygen @xmath29 coordinates induce an increase in the difference between the short and long a1@xmath48o3 and a2@xmath48o4 bond lengths .",
    "this increases the dipole moments from the a1 and a2 coordinations with decreasing @xmath84 .",
    "however , the antiparallel coupling between the local dipole moments at the a1 and the a2 site prevents a clear effect on the total dipole moment .    in conclusion ,",
    "the hexagonal amno@xmath2 compounds exhibit both antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric order .",
    "the magnetic exchange and spins are confined in the basal plane , whereas the dielectric moments originate predominantly from displacements parallel to the @xmath7-axis .",
