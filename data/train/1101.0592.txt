    "as first pointed out by kobayashi and maskawa  @xcite ( km ) , if nature possesses three generations of quarks , then there would exist an irremovable @xmath14 violating phase in the charge current . with the emergence of the @xmath15 lepton and the @xmath16 quark ,",

    "a better limit was obtained recently in the lepton plus jets study based on 4.8 fb@xmath24 collected data .",
    "cdf searched for an excess of events with an electron or a muon , at least five jets ( one tagged as a @xmath16 or @xmath26 ) , and an imbalance of transverse momentum .",
    "the observed events were consistent with background expectations , giving the upper limit of @xmath27 gev at 95% cl  @xcite .",

    "these studies clearly harbinger the passing of the torch from the tevatron to the lhc , as far as heavy chiral quark search is concerned .    in this report , we first take closer scrutiny of the @xmath32 decay process to illustrate the width effect involving two unstable daughters . the decay widths of @xmath33",

    "for different @xmath1 mass scenarios , the decay rate of @xmath33 can be effectively 5-body , 4-body , 3-body , or finally , the two - body @xmath35 process above @xmath34 threshold of @xmath39 gev .",
    "the method is applied to investigate @xmath8 or @xmath9 decays , depending on mass hierarchy .",

    "at the same time , there would be a separate analysis track of @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 , similar to the current @xmath165 search program .",
    "the @xmath16 ( and @xmath26 ) tagging separation , already invoked by cdf  @xcite , must be applied , together with an effort to separate the mass and charge of the decaying parent . in the case of prominent @xmath158",
    ", the @xmath185 mode could result in @xmath186 events that have no trace of top quarks in them .",
    "a main consequence of the consideration of threshold behavior for @xmath10 is that , if this decay mode can be separated in the above analysis ( and with @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays separated ) , we have an  amplifier \" for the measurement of small @xmath43 values in the measurement of bf(@xmath10 ) , if @xmath176 is satisfied .",
    "consideration of @xmath159 implies that one really measures the ratio of @xmath2 and @xmath10 decay rates , while the ratio with @xmath159 would provide information on @xmath187 .",
    "the analysis can be extended if in fact @xmath188 is found , though one would then be more sensitive to modest , rather than very small @xmath43 values .    in conclusion , with the fast rise in accumulated luminosity at the lhc ,",
    "one expects great progress in the search for fourth generation @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks , with good potential for discovery .",
    "if discovery is made , the next task would be to sort out all decay modes .",
    "for this matter , it is important to cover , and separate , the ckm suppressed decays @xmath159 and @xmath158 .",
    "equally important would be to search for either @xmath189 , or @xmath190 , where the electroweak precision test constraint of @xmath191 would imply that the associated @xmath31 boson is virtual .",
    "the decay final states of these very heavy chiral quarks would be rather complex , but the threshold sensitivity studied in this work suggests that a measurement of the @xmath189 ( or @xmath190 ) decay branching fraction , as compared with @xmath2 and @xmath192 ( or @xmath3 and @xmath193 ) , would provide a sensitive measurement of @xmath43 or the combined strength of @xmath12 and @xmath125 ( @xmath44 or the combined strength of @xmath13 and @xmath126 ) .",
    "this would complement the indirect studies of loop - induced @xmath194 transitions for an enlarged quark mixing sector .",
    "iii , we compared our various calculations of the @xmath33 decay width with the result for five - body final state . even though @xmath195 gev is excluded by experimental data , it is of interest to compare the calculated decay widths with those from the pythia 6 generator  @xcite , at least as a cross - check .",
    "the results are shown side - by - side in fig .",
    "[ pythia ] . for the pythia results ,",
    "we identify an on - shell or off - shell decay with the definition described in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] of this report .",
    "that is , by comparing the mass of the decaying @xmath37 or @xmath31 with its central value , if the applied energy is larger than the central value of the particle mass three times of the natural width , the decay is identified as on - shell , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tbwwid ] .",
    "the same definition is used in the integrations of @xmath68-body model calculations .",
    "although the trends of our calculation and the pythia results are similar , we can see quantitative deviations .",
    "clearly , the effects of initial and final state interactions ( isr / fsr ) as well as other corrections that are built into pythia are not considered in our calculation .",
    "the actual cause of the deviations would need further investigation to clarify .",
