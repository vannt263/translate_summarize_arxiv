    "the sudden spin jumps , or _ glitches _ , commonly seen in isolated neutron stars are thought to represent angular momentum transfer between the crust and the liquid interior @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "as a neutron star s crust spins down under magnetic torque , differential rotation develops between the stellar crust and a portion of the liquid interior .",
    "the more rapidly rotating component then acts as an angular momentum reservoir which occasionally exerts a spin - up torque on the crust as a consequence of an instability .",
    "the vela pulsar , one of the most active glitching pulsars , typically undergoes fractional changes in rotation rate of @xmath4 every three years on average@xcite . with the vela pulsar having",
    "exhibited 13 glitches , meaningful study of the statistical properties of these events is now possible .    in this letter",
    "we study the time distribution of vela s glitches and determine the average angular momentum transfer rate in vela and in six other pulsars .",
    "we present evidence that glitches in vela represent a self - regulating instability for which the star prepares over a waiting interval .",
    "we obtain a lower limit on the fraction of the star s liquid interior responsible for glitches . assuming that glitches are driven by the liquid residing in the inner crust , as in most glitch models , we show that vela s ` radiation radius ' is @xmath5 km for a mass of @xmath3 .",
    "future measurements of neutron star radii will check the universality of this constraint and hence test our understanding of neutron star structure and the origin of glitches .",
    "a glitch of magnitude @xmath6 requires angular momentum @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the moment of inertia of the solid crust plus any portions of the star tightly coupled to it . most of the core liquid is expected to couple tightly to the star s solid component , so that @xmath8 makes up at least 90% of the star s total moment of inertia@xcite .",
    "glitches are driven by the portion of the liquid interior that is differentially rotating with respect to the crust .",
    "the cumulative angular momentum imparted to the crust over time is @xmath9 where @xmath10 rad s@xmath11 is the average spin rate of the crust over the period of observations .",
    "1 shows the cumulative dimensionless angular momentum , @xmath12 , over @xmath13 years of glitch observations of the vela pulsar , with a linear least - squares fit .",
    "the average rate of angular momentum transfer associated with glitches is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the slope of the straight line in fig . 1 : @xmath16 this rate @xmath15 is often referred to as the _ pulsar activity parameter_.    the angular momentum flow is extremely regular ; none of vela s 13 glitches caused the cumulative angular momentum curve to deviate from the linear fit shown in fig . 1 by more than 12% . to assess the likelihood that the linear trend could have arisen by chance , we tested the statistical robustness of this result .",
    "we generated many sets of simulated data in which the occurrence times of the glitches remained as observed , but the magnitudes of the 13 glitches were randomly shuffled .",
    "we compared the observed @xmath17 to those for the deviations of the randomly shuffled data from linear fits .",
    "the @xmath17 for the shuffled data was less than that of the real @xmath17 in only @xmath18% of cases , strongly suggesting that the rate of angular momentum flow associated with glitches is reasonably constant .    additionally , the near uniformity of the intervals between the glitches in fig .",
    "1 suggests that glitches occur at fairly regular time intervals .",
    "the standard deviation in observed glitch intervals is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 d is the average glitch time interval .",
    "the probability of 13 randomly - spaced ( poisson ) events having less than the observed standard deviation is only @xmath21% .    the data of fig .",
    "1 indicate that vela s glitches are not random , but represent a self - regulating process which gives a relatively constant flow of angular momentum to the crust with glitches occurring at fairly regular time intervals .",
    "the average rate of angular momentum transfer in vela s glitches constrains the properties of the angular momentum reservoir that drives the spin jumps . in particular , the frequent occurrence of large glitches requires that a significant fraction of the interior superfluid spins at a higher rate than the crust of the star . between glitches , the reservoir acquires excess angular momentum as the rest of the star slows under the magnetic braking torque acting on the crust .",
    "excess angular momentum accumulates at the maximum rate if the reservoir does not spin down between glitches .",
    "hence , the rate at which the reservoir accumulates angular momentum capable of driving glitches is limited by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the average spin - down rate of the crust , and @xmath24 is the moment of inertia of the angular momentum reservoir ( not necessarily one region of the star ) .",
    "equating @xmath25 to the average rate of angular momentum transfer to the crust , @xmath14 , gives the constraint , @xmath26 where the _ coupling parameter _ @xmath27 is the minimum fraction of the star s moment of inertia that stores angular momentum and imparts it to the crust in glitches . using the observed value of vela s activity parameter @xmath15 and @xmath28 kyr , we obtain the constraint @xmath29 a similar analysis for six other pulsars yields the results shown in fig .",
    "an earlier analysis of glitches in vela gave @xmath30%@xcite .",
    "after vela , the most significant limit is obtained from psr 1737 - 30 which gives @xmath31% .",
    "the similarity of @xmath27 for the five objects of intermediate age suggests that glitches in all these objects are driven by internal components with about the same fractional moment of inertia . in terms of @xmath27 ,",
    "the crab pulsar and psr 0525 + 21 appear to be unusual .",
    "it may be that the crab s angular momentum reservoir loses its excess angular momentum between glitches , perhaps through thermal creep of superfluid vortices ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the value of @xmath27 for psr 0525 + 21 is not well determined , since only two glitches from this object have been measured .",
    "the constraint of @xmath32% for vela applies regardless of where in the star glitches originate .",
    "many glitch models , however , assume that the internal angular momentum reservoir is the superfluid that coexists with the inner crust lattice @xcite , where the pinning of superfluid vortex lines sustains a velocity difference between the superfluid and the crust . here",
    "we explore the implications of this interpretation .",
    "we begin by describing how the moment of inertia of the superfluid in the neutron star crust relates to the nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) and the observable properties of neutron stars .",
    "ravenhall & pethick @xcite have shown that , for various equations of state , the total moment of inertia @xmath33 is given by the approximate expression @xmath34   i \\simeq { 8\\pi\\over3}\\int_0^r r^4(\\rho+p / c^2 ) e^{\\lambda } dr\\equiv \\tilde{j } , \\label{i}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the mass - energy density , @xmath36 is the pressure , and @xmath37 is the local gravitational redshift .",
    "this expression , which holds in the limit of slow rotation , defines the integral @xmath38 .",
    "this integral can be evaluated following lattimer & prakash @xcite who noted that @xmath39 throughout most of the interior of a neutron star ( but _ not _ in the crust ) , for all commonly - used equations of state . with this approximation",
    ", it can be shown @xcite that @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the total stellar mass .",
    "equation ( [ i ] ) can also be used to determine the moment of inertia of the crust plus liquid component . in the crust",
    "@xmath36 is @xmath43 , and the tov equation is @xmath44 using this approximation in eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) gives the fraction of the star s moment of inertia contained in the solid crust ( and the neutron liquid that coexists with it ) : @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the radial extent of the crust and @xmath47 is the pressure at the crust - core interface .",
    "a similar approximation is obtained in ref . 7 ( equation 17 ) ; either approximation is adequate for the estimates we are making here . in",
    "most of the crust , the equation of state has the approximately polytropic form @xmath48 , giving@xcite @xmath49^{-1}\\ , , \\label{integral}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the density at the core - crust transition and @xmath51 is the neutron mass .",
    "@xmath52 can thus be expressed as a function of @xmath42 and @xmath53 with an additional dependence upon the eos arising through the values of @xmath47 and @xmath50 .",
    "however , @xmath47 is the main eos parameter as @xmath50 enters chiefly via a correction term . in general",
    ", the eos parameter @xmath47 varies over the range @xmath54 mev @xmath55 for realistic equations of state @xcite .",
    "larger values of @xmath47 give larger values for @xmath56 , as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ [ integral ] ] .",
    "combining of eqs .",
    "[ [ deltai ] ] and [ [ integral ] ] with a lower limit on @xmath57 and an upper limit on @xmath47 gives a lower limit on the neutron star radius for a given mass . in order to relate our observational bound on @xmath58 to @xmath57 , we assume that the angular momentum reservoir is confined to the neutron superfluid that coexists with the nuclei of the inner crust . in this case ,",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "our observational limit on @xmath24 then gives @xmath61 . to obtain a strong lower limit on the neutron star radius ,",
    "we take @xmath62 mev @xmath55 and @xmath63 @xmath55 . combining the relations [ [ deltai ] ] and [ [ integral ] ] ,",
    "gives the heavy dashed curve in fig .",
    "this curve is given approximately by @xmath64 stellar models that are compatible with the lower bound on @xmath65 must fall below this line .",
    "smaller @xmath47 reduces the crustal moment of inertia and gives a more restrictive constraint .",
    "for example , @xmath66 mev @xmath55 moves the constraining contour to approximately @xmath67 ( thin dashed curve of fig .",
    "to summarize our conclusions regarding the statistics of vela s glitches , we find that angular momentum is imparted to the crust at regular time intervals at a rate that has remained nearly constant for @xmath68 yr .",
    "these data narrowly constrain the _ coupling parameter _ @xmath27 which is the minimum fraction of the star s moment of inertia that is responsible for glitches . for vela",
    "we find @xmath69 , indicating that least @xmath70% of the star s moment of inertia acts as an angular momentum reservoir for driving the glitches , regardless of where in the star this angular momentum reservoir is , or how it is coupled to the crust .",
    "variation of @xmath27 by a factor of less than @xmath71 for stars in the age group @xmath72 yr suggests that glitches in stars in this age group all involve regions of about the same fractional moment of inertia .",
    "mass measurements of radio pulsars in binary systems and of neutron star companions of radio pulsars give neutron star masses consistent with a very narrow distribution , @xmath73 @xcite , indicated by the pair of horizontal dotted lines in fig .",
    "if vela s mass falls in this range , eq . [ [ rlimit ] ] constrains @xmath74 km , under the assumption that glitches arise in the inner crust superfluid .",
    "the quantity constrained by observations of the stellar luminosity and spectrum is the ` radiation radius ' @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath76 for vela , the above constraint gives @xmath77 km if glitches arise in the inner crust . for comparison ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3 the mass - radius curves for several representative equations of state ( heavy solid lines ) . measurement of @xmath78 km would be inconsistent with most equations of state if @xmath79 .",
    "stronger constraints could be obtained if improved calculations of nuclear matter properties indicate @xmath47 significantly less than 0.65 mev @xmath55 .",
    "for example , for @xmath80 , @xmath81 km would be required if @xmath66 mev @xmath55 .",
    "a measurement of @xmath82 km would rule out most equations of state regardless of mass or the angular momentum requirements of glitches .",
    "a promising candidate for a decisive measurement of a neutron star s radiation radius is rx j185635 - 3754 , an isolated , non - pulsing neutron star @xcite .",
    "a black body fit to the x - ray spectrum gives @xmath83 km where @xmath84 is the distance ( known to be less than 120 pc ) .",
    "however , either a non - uniform surface temperature or radiative transfer effects in the stellar atmosphere could raise this estimate significantly @xcite .",
    "hst observations planned for this year should determine the star s proper motion and parallax , and hence , the distance .",
    "future chandra observations should yield more detailed spectral data and could establish the composition of the atmosphere if absorption lines are identified .",
    "these distance and spectral data may establish whether this object s radius is consistent with an inner crust explanation of neutron star glitches .",
