    "although the existence of @xmath0 hypernuclei nearly rules out a stable @xmath10 dibaryon , a @xmath11 dominated @xmath10 resonance might affect the systematics of @xmath0 binding energies .",
    "only three emulsion events presented serious candidates for @xmath0 hypernuclei before 2001 : @xmath12be @xcite , @xmath13he @xcite and @xmath14b @xcite . the @xmath0",
    "binding energies @xmath15 deduced from these events indicated that the @xmath16 interaction @xmath17 was strongly attractive , with a @xmath0 excess binding energy @xmath18 mev , although it had been realized that the binding energies of @xmath12be and @xmath13he were inconsistent with each other @xcite . here , the @xmath0 excess binding energy is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the ( 2@xmath21 + 1)-average of @xmath22 values for the @xmath23 hypernuclear core levels . for comparison , @xmath24 mev , implying the unnatural ordering @xmath25 .",
    "this perception changed in 2001 when a uniquely assigned @xmath26 hybrid - emulsion event @xcite , with updated values @xcite @xmath27 ruled out the high value of @xmath28 from the dubious earlier @xmath26 event @xcite , restoring thus the expected hierarchy @xmath29 .",
    "both capture at rest formation @xmath30 and weak decay @xmath31 , in this so called nagara event , yield consistently with each other the values listed in ( [ eq : ll6he ] ) .",
    "neither @xmath26 nor @xmath32 have excited states that could bias the determination of @xmath33 .    accepting the nagara event calibration of @xmath17 , we review and discuss ( i ) particle stability for lighter @xmath0 hypernuclei ; ( ii ) reinterpretation of the events assigned @xmath34 and @xmath6 ; ( iii ) several alternative assignments for the @xmath6 event ; and ( iv ) plausibility of the assignments @xmath7 or @xmath8 proposed for the recently reported hida event @xcite .",
    "in the course of doing so , we compare @xmath15 values derived from emulsion events with shell - model predictions @xcite and with selected few - body cluster calculations @xcite where the latter exist .",
    "from the very beginning it was recognized that @xmath0 and @xmath35 were unbound @xcite ; if @xmath35 were bound , the existence of a @xmath36 bound state would follow .",
    "the existence of a @xmath37h bound state was claimed by ags - e906 @xcite , from correlated weak - decay pions emitted sequentially by @xmath0 hypernuclei produced in a @xmath38 reaction on @xmath39be .",
    "however , the @xmath37h interpretation is controversial @xcite .",
    "several post-2001 calculations exist for @xmath40h .",
    "a faddeev - yakubovsky 4-body calculation finds no bound state @xcite , whereas a stochastic - variational ( sv ) 4-body calculation finds it to be bound by as much as 0.4 mev @xcite .",

    "@xcite finds @xmath40h to be particle stable by as little as a few kev , which would be insufficient to maintain particle stability once @xmath17 is renormalized to reproduce the recently updated ( smaller ) value of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ll6he ] ) for @xmath42 .",
    "regardless of whether @xmath40h is particle - stable or not , there is a general consensus that the mirror @xmath0 hypernuclei @xmath43h@xmath43he are particle - stable , with @xmath44 mev @xcite , or larger owing to the @xmath45 coupling which is particularly effective here @xcite .",
    "in addition , substantial charge symmetry breaking effects are expected in these systems , resulting in a higher binding energy of @xmath43he by up to 0.5 mev with respect to @xmath43h @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] demonstrates how @xmath28 values for the @xmath46 systems , calculated over a broad range of @xmath17 strengths , are nearly linearly correlated with only a small offset .",
    "thus , the stability of @xmath47he ensures stability for @xmath43h .",
