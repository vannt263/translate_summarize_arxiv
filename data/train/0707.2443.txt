    "the discovery of the cosmic far - infrared background ( cib ) in 1996 , together with recent cosmological surveys from the mid - infrared to the millimeter has revolutionized our view of star formation at high redshifts .",
    "it has become clear , in the last decade , that infrared galaxies contribute to a large part of the whole galaxy build- up in the universe . since the discovery of the cib , new results on the identification of the sources contributing to the cib , their redshift distribution , and their nature , are coming out at increasing speed , especially through multi - wavelength analysis ( see for a review lagache et al .",
    "stacking analysis are also very promising to probe the cib source populations ( e.g. dole et al .",
    "@xcite , wang et al .",
    "@xcite , dye et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , up to now , very little information is available on the clustering of infrared galaxies , although getting information on the clustering is essential to understand their formation process and to see how they relate to the other galaxy populations .",
    "+ the first three - dimensional quantitative measurements of the clustering strength of ultra and hyper luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , hylirgs ) at high redshifts ( @xmath3 ) have been made by blain et al .",
    "@xcite , farrah et al .",
    "@xcite and magliocchetti et al .",
    "these studies show that ulirgs and hylirgs are associated with the most massive dark matter halos at high redshifts , unlike in the local universe where the star formation is quenched in the densest environments .",
    "cib anisotropy observations provide a powerful complement to direct high angular resolution observations of individual sources .",
    "cib fluctuations measure , at large angular scales , the linear clustering bias and , at small angular scales , the nonlinear clustering within a dark - matter halo ( cooray & sheth @xcite ) .",
    "they thus probe both the dark - matter halo mass scale and the physics governing the formation of infrared galaxies within a halo .",
    "however , up to now correlated anisotropies have never been firmly detected . in the far - infrared , detection of anisotropies",
    "is limited to the poisson contribution ( lagache & puget @xcite , matsuhara et al .",
    "@xcite , miville - deschnes et al .",
    "+ we report the detection of cib correlated anisotropies at 160 @xmath0 m in the _ spitzer _ swire lockman hole field and give a first constraint on the linear bias .",
    "the paper is organised as follow : data are presented in sect .",
    "[ sect : data ] .",
    "the power spectrum is analysed in sect .",
    "[ sect : pk ] . finally a summary and discussion are given in sect .",

    "swire has surveyed 49 square degrees distributed over 6 fields in the northern and southern sky ( lonsdale et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the lockman hole is the largest field with the lowest cirrus emission .",
    "it covers about 10 square degrees at 160 @xmath0 m .",
    "raw data were reduced using the data analysis tool ( gordon et al .",
    "@xcite ) version 2.71 .",
    "we systematically removed each dce ( data collection event ) after the stimulator flash to minimize the latency effect .",
    "we use the last calibration factor ( 44.7 ) to convert _ mips _ units to mjy / sr .",
    "data were finally projected on a grid with 15.95 arcsecond pixels .",
    "the map is shown on fig .",
    "[ last_map ] .",
    "further processings were necessary prior to measuring the power spectrum .",
    "we first needed to remove residual stripes .",
    "this has been done exactly in the same way as in miville - deschne & lagache @xcite .",
    "this paper shows that our method efficiently removed residual stripes without affecting the astrophysical signal .",
    "we then remove all sources with s@xmath6200 mjy ( 200 mjy is the high reliability threshold , as detailed in surace et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for this purpose",
    "we use daophot to detect the sources ( the image was wavelet filtered prior to the detection ) .",
    "we then measure the fluxes using aperture photometry .",
    "after a fine centering on the sources , we integrate within 25  .",
    "sky values are estimated in an [ 80-110  ] annulus .",
    "we compute the aperture correction  which is 2.02  using an effective instrumental function ( that we call psf for point spread function ) measured directly on a _ mips _ 160 @xmath0 m map . using an effective psf rather than",
    "the psf computed using the stinytim program is important to take into account the survey strategy . in the lockman hole swire field ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio was not high enough to accuratly measure the psf .",
    "we thus use the gto / cdfs field in which the integration time is 6 times that in the lockman hole swire field .",
    "we checked that our measured fluxes at 160 @xmath0 m were in very good agreement with the swire dr2 catalog ( better than 10@xmath7 on average ) . on fig [ last_map ]",
    "is shown the final map that will be used to compute the power spectrum .",
    "there are four contributors to the power spectrum at 160 @xmath0 m : cirrus emission , poisson ( shot ) noise from discrete unresolved sources , cib clustering ( if any ) , and instrumental noise .",
    "if the noise and the signal are not correlated , the measured power spectrum @xmath8 follows : @xmath9 + n(k)\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the 2d wavenumber ( @xmath11 , expressed in arcmin@xmath12 ) , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the power spectrum of the dust emission , the shot noise from unresolved sources ( constant ) , the clustering and the noise .",
    "the factor @xmath17 represents the power spectrum of the psf . to isolate the astrophysical components",
    ", we have to determine @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "+ the noise power spectrum @xmath16 is computed by subtracting two maps of exactly the same region as detailed in miville - deschnes et al .",
    "we construct two maps using the even and odd scans .",
    "as expected , @xmath16 and @xmath8 meet at small scales ( @xmath18 arcmin@xmath12 ) where the signal is noise - dominated .",
    "the noise power spectrum @xmath16 is subtracted from the raw power spectrum @xmath8 .",
    "+ one of the critical issues is to correct the power spectrum from the psf @xmath17 .",
    "the psf at 160 @xmath0 m computed using the stinytim program is very accurate but does not include any effect induced by the observing strategy .",
    "we have therefore also extracted direcly the psf from the data ( as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : data ] ) .",
    "the comparison of the power spectrum corrected by these two psf is shown on fig .",
    "[ pk_raw ] .",
    "they are in very close agrement but we can notice that the effective psf gives a better result ( i.e. a flat power spectrum for @xmath19 arcmin@xmath12 , as expected from @xmath14 ) .",
    "+ the error bars ( shown in fig . [ pk_tot ] ) are estimated using a frequentist approach .",
    "mock signal plus noise maps are generated and analysed with the same pipeline as for the data .",
    "this gives a set of power spectra of which we compute the covariance matrix .",
    "the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are the errors on the measured power spectrum .",
    "several studies show that the cirrus component dominate the power spectra at large scales for k@xmath200.01 arcmin@xmath12 ( e.g. miville - deschnes et al .",
    "@xcite ) . with the swire data only , in such a low interstellar dust column density field , @xmath21 can not be constrained .",
    "larger maps are needed .",
    "we therefore compute the power spectrum of a large ( @xmath22200 sq . deg . ) _ iris / iras _ 100 @xmath0 m maps ( miville - deschnes & lagache @xcite ) .",
    "the swire lockman hole field is embedded in this large _ iris _ map so that the average 100 @xmath0 m dust emission is the same in the swire and larger map ( 4% difference ) . having the same average brightness is important since the normalisation of the cirrus power spectrum in the very diffuse region scales as @xmath23 ( miville - deschnes et al .",
    "we compute the power spectrum of the 100 @xmath0 m map after removing the bright sources as in miville - deschnes et al .",
    "we keep only the largest scales ( @xmath249 @xmath25 arcmin@xmath12 ) , where we have only the contribution from the cirrus component  the cib being negligible at these very large scales  and multiply the power spectrum by the average dust emission color @xmath26 .",
    "the color has been computed using dirbe and firas data .",
    "we compute the average @xmath27 spectrum of the dust emission correlated with the hi gas as in lagache @xcite .",
    "we then fit the peak of the dust emission spectrum to get the color .",
    "we obtain @xmath28=2.06 .",
    "if we take @xmath29 , the color varies by @xmath2210@xmath7 .",
    "we show on fig .",
    "[ pk_raw ] the 160 @xmath0 m power spectrum derived from _ iris _ data together with the 160 @xmath0 m _ mips _ power spectrum .",
    "the spectra agree impressively well .",
    "we can thus use this extended @xmath8 to constrain the cirrus contribution . in the following",
    ", the two spectra are stiched so that we use one spectrum from k@xmath220.001 to 1 arcmin@xmath12 .",
    "the cirrus component follows : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the power spectrum value at @xmath32=0.01 arcmin@xmath12 . @xmath31 and @xmath33 are determined by fitting the power spectrum ( see sect .",
    "[ allfit ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath34 jy@xmath35/sr and @xmath36 .",
    "the normalisation can be converted at 100 @xmath0 m using the 160/100 color given above ; we obtain @xmath37 jy@xmath35/sr .",
    "considering that the mean cirrus value at 100 @xmath0 m in our field is i@xmath38=0.51 mjy / sr , our measured @xmath39 and @xmath33 are in excellent agreement with miville - deschnes et al . @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of the cirrus component ( eq . [ pk ] ) is displayed on fig .",
    "[ pk_raw ] .",
    "the measured power spectrum clearly has an excess of power w.r.t . the cirrus contribution for @xmath400.3 arcmin@xmath12 .",
    "we interpret this strong excess as the signature of correlated cib anisotropies .",
    "+ we model the correlated anisotropies following knox et al . @xcite . using the three - dimensional , linear - theory power spectrum of dark matter density fluctuations today , @xmath41 the power spectrum of cib anisotropies can be written as : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the comoving proper - motion distance , k the 3d wavenumber ( @xmath44 , in mpc@xmath12 ) , a(z ) the scale factor , @xmath45 is the mean infrared galaxy emissivity per unit of comoving volume , and @xmath46 is the linear theory growth function .",
    "@xmath47 is the angular multipole sets using the limber approximation , @xmath48 .",
    "we assume that the fluctuations in emissivity @xmath49 are a biased tracer of those in the mass and introduce the bias parameter @xmath50 , that we assume independent of redshift and scale : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the dark matter density field .",
    "we compute the emissivity using the infrared galaxy evolution model of lagache et al .",
    "this model , valid in the range 3 - 1000 @xmath0 m , is in very good agreement with mid - ir to far - ir number counts , cib observations , resolved sources redshift distributions and local luminosity functions and their evolution up to @xmath53 ( e.g. lagache et al .",

    "@xcite , caputi et al .",
    "@xcite ) . fixing the cosmology , the only unkown parameter in eq . [ bigeq ] is the bias @xmath50 .",
    "we fit simultaneously @xmath31 , @xmath33 , @xmath50 and @xmath14 using the non - linear least - squares curve fitting mpfit programcraigm / idl / idl.html ] .",
    "we obtain @xmath54 jy@xmath35/sr , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 jy@xmath35/sr .",

    "[ sec : excess ] .",
    "@xmath14 agrees quite well with previous _",
    "determination at roughly the same @xmath58 threshold ( matsuhara et al .",
    "the fact that @xmath31 , @xmath33 , and @xmath14 are in very good agreement with previous measurements give us confidence in our measurement of the linear bias @xmath59 .",
    "it is well known that in the local universe infrared galaxies are not biased tracers of the mass .",
    "for example , saunders et al .",
    "@xcite found @xmath60=0.69@xmath610.09 for _ iras _ galaxies .",
    "assuming @xmath62=0.8 gives @xmath63 0.86 .",
    "this bias is roughly comparable to the bias of the sdss galaxies at @xmath64 ( @xmath65 , tegmark et al .",
    "we measure an average bias about 2 times higher in the cib anisotropies .",
    "figure [ fluc ] shows the predicted redshift contribution to the correlated anisotropies . at @xmath10=0.05 arcmin@xmath12 , anisotropies from @xmath66 infrared galaxies",
    "contribute for more @xmath2265% .",
    "lower redshift galaxies contribute for less than 5% .",
    "this shows that infrared galaxies at z@xmath221 are much more biased ( @xmath222 times ) than locally .",
    "we presented the power spectrum measured in the _",
    "spitzer_/swire lockman hole field at 160 @xmath0 m .",
    "it is very well reproduced by the contribution from three components , cirrus , correlated cib , and poisson noise .",
    "the cirrus and poisson contributions are very close to previous measurements .",
    "we measure the linear bias , @xmath1 .",
    "this bias is likely to be that of infrared galaxies at @xmath67 since @xmath67 galaxies are dominating the contribution to the correlated cib anisotropies ( fig .",
    "[ fluc ] ) and local galaxies are `` anti - biased '' . such a bias is analog ( but somewhat higher ) to the bias of the red optical galaxy population at @xmath67 .",
    "for example , marinoni et al .",
    "@xcite measured a bias of 1.6 at @xmath68 for the red @xmath69 galaxies in the vvds .",
    "blue galaxies at those redshifts are less biased with a relative bias between red and blue population of 1.4 .",
    "+ the very strong evolution of the bias ( from @xmath221.7 at @xmath70 to 0.86 at z=0 ) shows that as time progresses and the density field evolves , nonlinear peaks become less rare events and galaxy formation moves to lower - sigma peaks .",
    "thus galaxies become less biased tracers of the mass density field . moreover , for the infrared galaxy population it is likely that an additional mecanism contributes significantly to the `` debiasing '' at low redshift .",
    "galaxies in dense environments are found to have suppressed star formation rates ( thus no or low infrared emission ) and early morphological types compared with those in the field .",
    "environmental effects in particular are important in quenching the star formation through gas stripping ( e.g. postman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , though on some cluster outskirts , some star formation goes on ( duc et al .",
    "@xcite , coia et al .",
    "the high bias found for infrared galaxies at @xmath67 shows that star formation rates of galaxies are increasing with the environment ( as also shown by e.g. elbaz et al .",
    "the `` merger bias '' is an alternative , but somehow physically linked , way of boosting the bias at high redshift .",
    "clustering of objects that have undergone recent mergers can be enhanced relative to the clustering of individual halos of comparable masses ( e.g. furlanetto & kamionkowski @xcite ; wetzel et al .",
    "it is known that the star formation in infrared galaxies is triggered to some extent by mergers in dense environments ( at z@xmath221 , 30 - 50% of luminous infrared galaxies are major mergers ) .",
    "thus , the high measured bias may also point to `` merger bias '' .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the _ spitzer _ space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 .",
    "this work benefited from funding from the cnes ( centre national detudes spatiales ) and the pnc ( programme national de cosmologie ) .",
