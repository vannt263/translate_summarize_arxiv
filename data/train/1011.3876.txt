    "the distance - redshift relation plays an important role in cosmology .",
    "in fact almost all cosmological observations depend , either explicitly or implicitly , on this relations . however , in general case , to calculate the distance , knowledge of matter distribution ( as well as its evolution ) between the observer and the source is needed",
    ". therefore , an approximate relations are of great use to astronomers .",
    "the simplest approximation assumes homogeneity of the universe and is based on the friedmann model .",
    "however , as the real universe is not homogeneous a more elaborate relations are needed .",
    "zeldovich ( 1964 ) proposed an approximation which takes into account that light propagates through emptier rather than denser regions of the universe .",
    "this approximation is now known as the dyer ",
    "roeder approximation ( dyer & roeder 1972 , 1973 ) .",
    "it also assumes homogeneity but allows for a different density than in the background model .",
    "the density difference is modelled by a constant , the so - called smoothness parameter @xmath1 . as the dyer ",
    "roeder equation is a differential equation an approximate analytic solution was presented and discussed by demiaski et al .",
    "generalisation to @xmath2 was first suggested by linder ( 1988 ) and the effect of the change of the expansion rate was discussed by mattsson ( 2010 ) .",
    "roeder relation was tested against cosmological observations by santos & lima ( 2006 ) , santos , cunha & lima ( 2008 ) , and yu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "however , it has been argued that the dyer ",
    "roeder relation may not properly describe the effect of matter clustering ( rsnen 2009 ; ellis 2009 ) and therefore may not be an appropriate approximation for the distance - redshift relation in the real universe . also , if the smoothness parameter changes with redshift the distance formula depends on several free - parameters whose interpretation can be ambiguous .",
    "therefore , although cosmologists are aware that not taking into account inhomogeneities introduce additional systematics , the dyer  roeder relation is not widely used . instead , several alternatives based either on the linear perturbative scheme ( see bonvin , durrer & gasparini 2006 and references therein ) or non - linear models ( see bolejko et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) have been developed .",
    "this paper explores the connection between the dyer  roeder approximation and the weak lensing approximation .",
    "it shows that the dyer ",
    "roeder relation can be modified so that it is consistent with the lensing approximation .",
    "the modified version contains only 1 free parameter of clear interpretation , i.e. the mean of density fluctuations along the line of sight @xmath3 .",

    "roeder approximation reduces to the standard friedmann relation for the distance ) . as seen",
    "@xmath26 is of negligible amplitude @xmath58 .",
    "thus , for this configuration , and under considered assumptions , there is no need to take into account inhomogeneities . also , another important fact is that @xmath26 in the weak lensing approximation is negative , while the dyer ",
    "roeder approximation implies positive @xmath26 .",
    "this is a consequence of positive density fluctuations along the line of sight .",
    "for example , for a source at @xmath59 ( based on 100,000 runs ) the mean of the present - day density fluctuations along the line of sight defined as @xmath60 is @xmath61 and the standard deviation @xmath62 , which implies @xmath63 .",
    "thus , as pointed out by rsnen ( 2009 ) in order to properly describe the effect of clustering , the smoothness parameter should be larger than 1 , not less than 1 as in the dyer  roeder approximation .",
    "however , in this case the difference as well as the total correction are negligible .",
    "however , even if the mean is negligible , the variance can provide additional information  see linder ( 2008 ) for a discussion .      in the previous section ,",
    "random matter fluctuations along the line of sight were considered .",
    "in such a case @xmath64 implies @xmath65 , and the distance correction is negligible .",
    "however , present - day matter fluctuations in the universe are not purely random but are organized  matter in the universe forms the cosmic web . in this case @xmath64",
    "does not necessarily imply @xmath65 . as seen in fig",
    "[ fig1]c the cosmic web contains large voids with fairly compact filaments .",
    "therefore , photons spend more time in voids than in overdense regions . in order to model this phenomenon",
    "let us consider a universe that consists of voids surround by filaments , each structure compensated .",
    "thus , by the construction a 3d average of density fluctuations is zero ( if averaged over sufficiently large scale ) .",
    "moreover , if the parameters of the system are adjusted ( see appendix [ a1dn0 ] for details ) then the pdf of density fluctuations can be almost log - normal .",
    "this feature is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which shows the pdf of density fluctuations smoothed within a sphere of radius 4 mpc .",
    "as seen the pdf is similar to log - normal pdf , apart from high @xmath36 where pdf is of lower amplitude  but see jain , seljak & white ( 2000 ) where the pdf of density fluctuations smoothed on scales of 3 @xmath66 mpc has also a lower amplitude for high @xmath36 than the log - normal distribution .    when the light ray exits one compensated structure before it enters another one , not only parameters of the next structure are generated , but also an angle @xmath43 , at which the light ray enters another structure .",
    "therefore , 4 different methods are going to be considered    1 .",
    "@xmath67 , the light ray always enters another structure at @xmath67 , thus it passes through the centre of the structure .",
    "@xmath43 is randomly generated from a uniform distribution between 0 and 0.5 @xmath46 .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b in this case structures can overlap .",
    "3 .   to reduce overlapping ,",
    "@xmath43 is generated from the gaussian distribution with the mean 0 and @xmath68 ( if @xmath69 then @xmath70 ) .",
    "@xmath43 is randomly generated from a uniform distribution between 0 and 0.25 @xmath46 .",
    "the distance correction @xmath26 ( the mean and variance ) is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . as seen",
    "if @xmath43 is randomly generated from a uniform distribution between 0 and 0.5 @xmath46 then the mean of density fluctuations along the line of sight is small and @xmath26 is almost negligible ( cf .",
    "brouzakis , tetradis & tzavara 2008 ; vanderveld , flanagan & wasserman 2008 ) .",
    "however , as pointed out above , if @xmath43 changes between @xmath71 and @xmath72 then structures can overlap ( see fig [ fig1]b ) . to reduce the overlapping , @xmath43 needs to by chosen from a smaller range of angles . in this case @xmath26 increases .",
    "this is because the light rays propagate more likely through voids than filaments .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the dyer ",
    "roeder relation is also presented .",
    "the dash - dotted line presents @xmath26 obtained from the original dyer ",
    "roeder formula , the dashed line and dotted line prenent the evolving smoothness parameter ( [ alphaz ] ) .    intuitively , if @xmath3 were just an ordinary density perturbation , in the linear regime , it should evolve according to ( [ deltaev ] ) .",
    "thus , the dotted line presents a model with @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is given by ( [ deltaev ] ) ( with an initial condition @xmath75 ) .",
    "following mattsson ( 2010 ) let us consider the dyer - roeder relation with a perturbed expansion rate . from the continuity equation @xmath76 ,",
    "the perturbation in the expansion rate are @xmath77 ( where @xmath78 follows from ( [ deltaev ] ) with an initial condition @xmath75 ) .",
    "we use this relation to calculate the perturbed @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and we then insert it to ( [ ddre ] ) , and using @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is given by ( [ deltaev ] ) , we get the distance correction that is presented using the dashed lines .    as seen , neither a constant @xmath1 , nor the evolving one ( with @xmath74 given by ( [ deltaev ] ) ) , or with a pertubed expanion rate , are consistent with the weak lensing approximation ( expect for the case where @xmath26 is almost negligible ) .",
    "however , if @xmath81 , where @xmath82 then the dyer ",
    "roeder approximation produces results comparable with the weak lensing approximation . as seen , the evolution of @xmath1 is not as intuitively expected , i.e. it does not directly follow from ( [ deltaev ] ) . here",
    "an empirical approach was employed , and it was found that if @xmath83 then the modified , in this way , dyer - roeader relation leads to the agreement with the lensing approximation .",
    "an important result of the above analysis is that a non - zero mean of density fluctuations along the line of sight can modify the distance by a few percent . as cosmological observations are now reaching the precision of a few percent ,",
    "a proper handling of the distance is essential .",
    "otherwise the errors in the estimation of the distance can become a major source of systematics .",
    "for example a proper handling of distance will be of great importance in the future analysis of bao experiments ( bolejko 2010 ) .",
    "the distance - redshift relation plays a central role in cosmology .",
    "if the homogeneous friedmann model correctly describes the evolution of the universe on large scales and , in addition , if density fluctuations along the line of sight vanish after averaging , then within the linear approximation , the distance correction is negligible  it is sufficient to apply the friedmann relation .",
    "however , if only the mean of density fluctuations along the line of sight is not zero then , even within the linear approximation , the distance can change by several percent .    in sec .",
    "[ d1dn0 ] it was shown that a vanishing 3d average of density fluctuations does not imply that the mean of density fluctuations along the line of sight is zero .",
    "it is argued that in the real universe this may be the case . in the real universe voids",
    "occupy large regions while overdensities are more compact . moreover , if light propagates for a long time through filaments then it is more likely to be absorbed or scattered . thus , if a remote galaxy is observed then most likely its photons propagated through emptier rather then denser regions . in this case the weak lensing approximation produces results that are similar to results obtained from the modified version of the dyer  roeder equation .",
    "the modified relation is    @xmath84    ( with initial conditions @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "thus apart from the background cosmological parameters , the only free parameter left is the mean of density fluctuations along the line of sight @xmath3 . since ( [ mdre ] ) is just an ordinary differential equation , it is as easy to implement it and solve numerically as the standard relation for the distance in the friedmann model .",
    "the mean of density fluctuations along the line of sight @xmath3 could either be deducted from the galaxy redshift surveys or n - body simulations .     it should be noted that the analysis presented here was based on the linear approximation ( the lensing approximation ) , i.e. higher order corrections to the distance were not taken into account .",
    "it is likely that quadratic corrections may lead to non - negligible @xmath26 even when @xmath41 . in this case",
    "the presented above modified version of the dyer ",
    "roeder equation would not be consistent with the actual non - linear distance - redshift relation , as when @xmath85 it reduces to the friedmannian relation ..",
    "the most important conclusion of this paper is that even within the idealized case of large scale homogeneous universe ( with only mpc - scale inhomogeneities ) the distance can be different than in the homogeneous universe .",
    "the difference can be of order of a few percent .",
    "thus , with an increasing precision of cosmological observations an accurate estimation of the distance is essential .",
    "otherwise errors due to miscalculation the distance can become a major source of systematics .",

    "<S> it is also shown that a vanishing 3d average of density fluctuations does not imply that the mean of density fluctuations along the line of sight is zero . in this case , even within the linear approximation , the distance correction is not negligible . the modified version of the dyer  roeder relation is presented and it is shown that this modified relation is consistent with the correction obtained within the weak lensing approximation . the correction to the distance for a source at @xmath0 is of order of a few percent . </S>",
    "<S> thus , with an increasing precision of cosmological observations an accurate estimation of the distance is essential . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise errors due to miscalculation the distance can become a major source of systematics .    [ firstpage ]    gravitational lensing : weak  cosmology : theory  large - scale structure of universe </S>"
