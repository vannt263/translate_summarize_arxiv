    "a lot of techniques and concepts of statistical mechanics of disordered spin systems , in particular , the replica method originally used to analyze the thermodynamics of spin glass model by sherrington and kirkpatrick @xcite , have been applied to various research fields beyond conventional physics , i.e. information processing @xcite , game theory @xcite and so on . the exactly solvable mathematical model , which describes these problems , is categorized as mean - field class @xcite .    on the other hand , as another exactly tractable model , in 1907 , paul and tatiana ehrenfest published a paper corroborating boltzmann s view of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "their urn model has been defined by kac @xcite as an exactly solvable example in statistical physics . while it has also been criticized as a marvelous exercise too far removed from reality ,",
    "their urn model has been applied to modern problems such as complex networks @xcite or econophysics @xcite , etc .",
    "for instance , based on extensive simulations of the lennard - jones fluid requiring in part a parallel computer in juelich , an italian - german team has shown that the prediction of the ehrenfest urn effectively describes the behavior of the gas phase @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been revealed that the mathematical structure of equilibrium state of the urn model @xcite is similar to the zero - range process , which has been widely investigated in research fields of non - equilibrium statistical physics @xcite .",
    "recently , in the research field of complex networks @xcite , ohkubo et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a network model based on ` ehrenfest class urn model ' to explain how the complex network gets scale - free - like properties , where ` ehrenfest class ' means that each urn has distinguishable balls . in the model , each urn corresponds to a node in graph ( network ) and the number of distinguishable balls , @xmath1 , in each urn is regarded as degree of nodes .",
    "for this model system , they succeeded in deriving the scale - free - like properties @xmath3 in the probability of the degree of nodes by the usage of the replica symmetric theory @xcite .",
    "in addition , the similarity between the disordered urn model and the random field ising model @xcite , and the condensation phenomena in the disordered urn model have been investigated @xcite .",
    "we here note that there are a lot of works in which the power - law behavior and the condensation phenomena in urn models have been studied @xcite . for example , in the zeta urn model @xcite , the power - law behavior in the probability of the number of balls , i.e. , the occupation distribution , stems from a power - law form of the boltzmann weight .",
    "however , when we attempt to describe various problems in the real world , we should take into account the disorder and treat the urns as a heterogeneous system .",
    "mainly , the previous models which cause power - law behavior in the occupation distribution do not contain any disorder , and hence it would be important to investigate ` disordered ' urn models which cause the power - law distribution .    in this paper , we propose two disordered urn models in which quenched randomness is important for generating the power - law behavior .",
    "one of them belongs to the ehrenfest class , and the other corresponds to the monkey class , in which each urn has indistinguishable balls . in particular , for the monkey class urn model , we investigate a real - space condensation phenomenon in which macroscopic number of balls are condensed into only one urn .",
    "the occupation probability @xmath0 with which an urn has @xmath1 balls is calculated analytically , and furthermore , the critical density @xmath4 for a given temperature is evaluated . as the result , it is shown that the occupation distribution function @xmath0 changes its scaling behavior from the exponential @xmath5-law to the @xmath6 power - law in large @xmath1 regime .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section [ sec : general ]",
    ", we introduce the general formalism for the urn model with an arbitrary energy function .",
    "although there are several analytical treatments for disordered urn models @xcite , we give the formalism for the disordered urn model with an arbitrary energy function with a different point of view , and additionally , the analytical treatment makes this paper self - contained .",
    "this analytical treatment contains both ehrenfest and monkey classes as its special cases .",
    "we explain the relation between the saddle point , that determines the thermodynamic properties of the system , and the chemical potential . with the assistance of this general formalism",
    ", we provide an analysis for a special choice of the energy function , which is an example of the ehrenfest class in section [ sec : ehrenfest ] .",
    "we discuss the condition on which the power - law appears in the tail of the occupation probability for the model . in section [ sec : be ] , we show that the condensation occurs for the special case of the monkey class with disorder , and a heavy tailed power - law emerges in the occupation probability . in section [ sec : econophysics ] , we provide a possible link between our results and macro economy , in particular , wealth differentials .",
    "last section is a summary .",
    "let us prepare @xmath7 urns and @xmath8 balls ( @xmath9 ) and consider the situation in which the @xmath7 urns share the @xmath8 balls .",
    "then , we start our argument from the ehrenfest class urn model @xcite in which each ball in urns is distinguishable . for the mathematical model categorized in the ehrenfest class , the boltzmann weight @xmath10 that @xmath11-th urn possesses @xmath12 balls is given by @xmath13}{n_{i}!},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is an energy function , @xmath15 a disorder parameter for urn @xmath11 , and @xmath16 the inverse temperature of the system .",
    "the factorial @xmath17 stems from the property of the ehrenfest class @xcite .",
    "the only point of our analysis which is different from @xcite is quenched disorder @xmath18 appearing in the energy function . for the ehrenfest class ,",

    "while one can calculate the configuration average by means of the replica method @xcite , it has been revealed that the mathematical structure of the disordered urn model is related to that of a random field ising model @xcite .",

    "\\label{eq : monkey}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be noted that in our formalism , the distinction between two models only comes from the difference of the effective boltzmann factor ( [ eq : monkey ] ) .",
    "we here also comment on the effect of the disorder to the dynamics of urn models . in the uniform case without disorder ,",
    "all urns are equivalent , and we do not distinguish each urn in the monkey class . on the other hand , in the disordered urn model , each urn @xmath11 has own label @xmath15 , and hence they are distinguishable at least in principle .",

    "of course , we might choose the other distribution @xmath42 , however , the main issue of this section is to examine whether the power - law appears in the occupation probability distribution when we introduce the disorder , and for this purpose , the simplest choice is enough .",
    "the tendency of this energy function to force each urn of the system to gather balls as much as possible results in the fact that _ the rich get richer _ as its collective behavior . we should mention that in @xcite , the co - called backgammon model @xcite described by the cost function @xmath74 for each urn was studied . in the model ,",

    ", we have the following occupation probability @xmath163 then , beyond the critical density @xmath164 , the occupation probability @xmath0 behaves as @xmath165 therefore , after the condensation , the crossover from the @xmath166-law to the @xmath167-law is observed around @xmath168 and as the result , the power - law heavy tail appears .",
    "in this section , we reconsider the results obtained in the previous sections from a view point of macro economics .",
    "it is easy for us to regard the occupation probability as wealth distribution when we notice the relations : balls - _ money _ and urns - _ people in a society_. in following , we attempt to find an interpretation of the condensation and the emergence of the pareto - law @xcite in terms of wealth differentials @xcite .    in section [ sec : ehrenfest ] , we devoted our analysis to extremely large income regimes ( the tail of the wealth distribution ) , however , it is quite important for us to consider the whole range of the wealth . as reported in @xcite , the wealth distribution for small income regime follows the gibbs / log - normal law and a kind of transition to the pareto - law phase is observed . for the whole range distribution of the wealth , the so - called lorentz curve @xcite is obtained .",
    "the lorentz curve is given in terms of the relation between the cumulative distribution of wealth and the fraction of the total wealth .",
    "then , the so - called gini index @xcite , which is a traditional , popular and one of the most basic measures for wealth differentials , could be calculated .",
    "the index could be changed from @xmath169 ( no differentials ) to @xmath144 ( the largest differentials ) .",
    "for the energy function ( [ eq : energy_en ] ) in the previous section , we derived the wealth distribution for the whole range of incomes @xmath1 . in this section",
    ", we evaluate the gini index analytically .",
    "as we mentioned above , the lorentz curve is determined by the relation between the cumulative distribution of wealth @xmath170 and the fraction of the total wealth @xmath171 for a given wealth distribution @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , the lorentz curve for the exponential distribution @xmath172 is given by @xmath173 we should notice that the lorentz curve for the exponential distribution is independent of @xmath174 .    for the power - law distribution @xmath175 , we have @xmath176 as the lorentz curve .",
    "this curve depends on the exponent @xmath174 . in figure",
    "[ fig : fg4 ] , we plot the lorentz curve for the exponential distribution ( [ eq : l_exp ] ) and the power - law distribution ( [ eq : l_pow ] ) with several values of @xmath174 .     and the lorentz curve ( e.g. @xmath177 for exponential distributions ) .",
    "the right panel shows the lorentz curves for the exponential distribution ( [ eq : l_exp ] ) and the power - law distributing ( [ eq : l_pow ] ) with several values of @xmath178 and @xmath94 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=291 ]   and the lorentz curve ( e.g. @xmath177 for exponential distributions ) .",
    "the right panel shows the lorentz curves for the exponential distribution ( [ eq : l_exp ] ) and the power - law distributing ( [ eq : l_pow ] ) with several values of @xmath178 and @xmath94 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=291 ]    then , as shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : fg4 ] , the gini index @xmath179 is defined as an area between the perfect equality line @xmath180 and the lorentz curve .",
    "this quantity explicitly reads @xmath181 and we have @xmath182 @xcite for the exponential distribution and @xmath183 for the power - law distribution . as the occupation probability distribution ( [ eq : be_dist2 ] ) is defined for @xmath184 , one can evaluate the gini index as a function of the saddle point @xmath62 . in figure",
    "[ fig : fg5 ] , we plot the lorentz curve ( left ) for several values of @xmath62 . in the right panel ,",
    "the gini index @xmath185 is shown .",
    "we find that the index approaches to @xmath186 as @xmath187 .    from the argument in the previous section",
    ", we easily find that the occupation distribution for @xmath188 non - condensed balls beyond the critical point is modified such as @xmath189 by choosing the density of the energy @xmath190 .",
    "namely , for the pareto - law distribution @xmath191 , the gini index leads to @xmath192 .",
    "therefore , the condensation is specified by the change of the gini index from @xmath182 to @xmath193 .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that the gini index itself has less information about the differentials than the wealth distribution .",
    "for example , the gini index for @xmath194 of the pareto - law @xmath195 gives the same gini index as the exponential distribution .",
    "this fact stems from the definition of the gini index @xmath179 , that is , @xmath179 is defined as an area between @xmath180 and the lorentz curve .",
    "it could be possible to draw lots of the lorentz curves that give the same area ( the same gini index ) . as we explained above ,",
    "it should be noted that actually the gini index is one of the measure for the earning differentials , however , the wealth distribution is much more informative than the gini index .    ) .",
    "the right panel shows the gini index for several values of @xmath62 . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=291 ] ) .",
    "the right panel shows the gini index for several values of @xmath62 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=291 ]    although the gini index is less informative than the distribution , however , for a given real ( empirical ) data @xmath196 ( @xmath197 denotes the amount of money for example .",
    "such empirical data are not always massive enough for us to specify the distribution ) , one can evaluate it as a statistics by @xmath198 with @xmath199 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is helpful for us to use the gini index to compare the earning differentials between different countries ( the population of each country should be different and of course it is finite @xmath200 ) . in our analysis of this paper ,",
    "the distribution was analytically obtained in the thermo - dynamic limit because we treated an ideal case as a society .",
    "nevertheless , even if we encounter more realistic situation for which the analytical evaluation of wealth distribution is very tough , one can evaluate the earning differentials via the gini index by computer simulations for finite population @xmath7 .",
    "then , one can investigate the earning differentials by comparing the numerical results with the analytical expressions obtained in this paper .",
    "in this paper , we investigated equilibrium properties of disordered urn model and discuss the condition on which the heavy tailed power - law appears in the occupation probability by using statistical physics of disordered spin systems .",
    "we applied our formalism to two urn models of both the ehrenfest and monkey classes .",
    "in particular , for the choice of the energy function as @xmath201 with density of state @xmath202 for the monkey class urn model , we found that above the critical density @xmath131 for a temperature , the condensation phenomenon is taken place , and most of the balls falls in an urn with the lowest energy level . as the result , the occupation probability changes its scaling behavior from the exponential @xmath5-law to the @xmath6 power - law in large @xmath1 regime .",
    "we also provided a possible link between our results and macro economy , in particular , wealth differentials .",
    "of course , there might exist the other urn models showing the power - law behavior after the condensation .",
    "in fact , we find such a case in a recent study on the ehrenfest urn model @xcite , in which the occupation probability follows a poisson - law when the condensation occurs . although we provided a piece of evidence to show that the power - law behavior in the occupation probability distribution takes place after the condensation for several restricted cases of the cost function , it is not yet clear whether the condensation always causes the power - law or not . the nature of the link between them will be a central problem to be clarified in future .",
    "therefore , as one of our future studies , it might be important to investigate the universality class of urn models that shows the power - law behavior in the occupation probability beyond the critical point .",
    "we hope that various versions and extensions of the disordered urn model , including backgammon model @xcite , could be applied to research area beyond conventional statistical physics .",

    "we would like to thank enrico scalas for introducing us their very recent studies @xcite concerning the ehrenfest urn model ."
