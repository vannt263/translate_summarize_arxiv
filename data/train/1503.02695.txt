    "entanglement has become a very useful tool to study the structure of complex quantum states , such as the ground states ( gs ) of interacting systems @xcite . geometry and quantum structure",
    "are linked via the so - called _ area laws _",
    "@xcite , which state that the entanglement entropy of a block @xmath0 , calculated in the ground state of a local hamiltonian , scales with the area of the boundary of the block .",
    "area laws have been proved only in a few cases , such as 1d gapped systems @xcite , and are violated in several interesting cases , such as conformal systems in 1d @xcite , where the entropy grows logarithmically with the block size , with a prefactor proportional to the central charge of the conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "these exceptions of the area law have received an increasing attention in recent studies @xcite .",
    "a strong violation of the area law takes place in an inhomogeneous free fermion model in 1d where the hopping amplitudes between consecutive sites decay exponentially outwards from the center of the chain @xcite . by tuning the exponential factor ,",
    "the gs of the system evolves smoothly from a logarithmic law towards a volume law for the entanglement entropy between the left and the right halves of the chain @xcite . in the strong inhomogeneity regime , when the exponential factor is high enough , the gs is the product state of bell - pairs symmetrically distributed around the center of the system , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rb_scheme ] .",
    "this valence bond state was termed concentric singlet phase ( csp ) @xcite or simply , rainbow state @xcite .",
    "the volume law for strong inhomogeneous chains can be easily understood from the rainbow picture .",
    "the entanglement entropy of half of the chain is given essentially by the number of bonds connecting the left and the right halves .",
    "however , for weak inhomogeneities the rainbow picture does not hold because the gs is a resonating valence bond state that satisfies a volume law plus logarithmic corrections @xcite .",
    "another type of inhomogeneity has been used to provide smooth boundary conditions which improve the convergence of the bulk properties of the gs @xcite . moreover ,",
    "an exponential increase of the couplings has been used in a kondo - like problem @xcite and a hyperbolic increase for the study of the scaling properties of non - deformed systems @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to understand the free fermion model in the weak inhomogeneity regime and its relation to the uniform limit given by a conformal field theory , namely a massless dirac fermion with open boundary conditions .",
    "one might think that some scaling limit of the model would correspond to a perturbation of the underlying cft .",
    "however , the perturbation can not correspond to local operators added to the action , since they do not give rise to volume law entropies .",
    "quite surprisingly , the solution of this puzzle is still provided by cft : the gs is a sort of thermal state that satisfies a volume law , with a temperature related to the exponential factor of the hopping amplitudes .",
    "from this perspective , the appearance of a volume law in the gs of the model is not surprising at all since , after all , it corresponds to a thermal state .",
    "yet , it comes as a surprise that the state remains pure .",
    "the understanding of this apparent contradiction will bring us to unexpected territories that we shall start to explore .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . after a general reminder of our model in section [ sec : model ] , containing an analysis of the strong inhomogeneity limit , we establish in section [ sec : continuum ] a continuum approximation in the vicinity of the homogeneous point , given by a deformation of the critical hamiltonian",
    "this deformation affects the single - particle wavefunctions and the low - energy excitations . in section [ sec : entanglement ] , we study the entanglement entropy within the csp .",
    "the continuum approximation of the previous section allows us to give an expression for the von neumann and rnyi entropies of the left half of the system throughout the transition .",
    "moreover , we show how the rnyi block entropies fit to the conformal expressions with varying coefficients . in section [ sec : rainbow2d ]",
    "we address the question : can the maximal area - law violation of the deformed hopping hamiltonian be extended to higher dimensions ?",
    "indeed , we find that a natural extension of the concentric singlet phase can be found in 2d systems .",
    "the article ends with a summary of our conclusions and ideas for further work .",
    "finally , in appendix [ sec : qubism ] , _ qubistic _ images @xcite are shown to provide useful information about the entanglement structure .",
    "let us consider a strongly inhomogeneous xx - model h_xx = _",
    "i=1^l-1 k_i ( ^x_i^x_i+1 + ^y_i^y_i+1 ) , [ eq : xx_ham ] where the @xmath1 are very different in value .",
    "we can apply the strong disorder renormalization group ( sdrg ) of ma and dasgupta @xcite in order to obtain the gs .",
    "the renormalization prescription is to pick up the strongest coupling , @xmath2 , and to establish a singlet bond on top of it .",
    "then , using second order perturbation theory , one finds the effective coupling between the two neighbours of the singlet , k = k_l k_r k_max , [ eq : rg_xx ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are , respectively , the left and right couplings to the maximal one .",
    "the renormalization continues by choosing the next largest coupling and so on .",
    "effective couplings may therefore emerge at long distances .",
    "the success of the sdrg scheme depends on the maximal coupling @xmath2 being always much larger than its neighboring values @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    using the jordan - wigner transformation",
    ", we can apply the same tools to study a fermionic hopping model in 1d with the same features @xcite , reading the couplings @xmath5 as hopping amplitudes , @xmath6 : h = _",
    "i=1^l-1 j_i c^_i c_i+1 + , [ eq : ferm_ham ] where @xmath7 creates a spinless fermion on site @xmath8 , and is related to @xmath9 via the non - local jordan - wigner transformation : c^_i = ^+_i _ j=1^i-1 ^z_j .",
    "[ eq : jw ] this non - local transformation points at a modification of the sdrg prescription to take into account the fermionic nature of the particles .",
    "effective hoppings between non - contiguous sites are equal to the corresponding coupling in the xx model multiplied by a sign , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of fermions between the two sites @xcite .",
    "this rule can be implemented with a simple modification of the renormalization group ( rg ) prescription . since a single fermion",
    "is always added at each rg step , j = - j_l j_r j_max .",
    "[ eq : rg_hop ] this implies that the hoppings can be either positive or negative .",
    "when they are positive , a singlet - type _ bond _ is established between both sites , of the form @xmath12 .",
    "if the hopping is negative , the corresponding triplet - type _ anti - bond _ is established : @xmath13 .",
    "both types of bonds share many properties , such as the entanglement .",
    "they both represent different flavors of a bell pair .",
    "the sdrg candidate for the gs of the system is a tensor product of bond or anti - bond states on the corresponding sites .",
    "indeed , it can be written as a fermi state :    creates either a bond or an anti - bond on a pair of sites , i.e. : @xmath14 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite , that the hamiltonian has the following properties , for any values of the @xmath15 .",
    "it presents particle - hole symmetry , which implies that for every single - particle eigenstate with energy @xmath16 there is another eigenstate with energy @xmath17 , which is related by swapping the sign of the components of all odd sites .",
    "thus , the ground state takes place at half - filling .",
    "moreover , the occupation number of every site is equal : @xmath18 .",
    "this is a non - intuitive result , given the inhomogeneity of hamiltonian , and it does not hold for excited states .",
    "let us describe the family of local hamiltonians whose ground state approaches asymptotically the concentric singlet phase , also known as rainbow state , and give some heuristic arguments to explain the volume law for the entanglement entropy .",
    "let us consider a chain with @xmath19 sites , which we will label using half - odd integers , @xmath20 .",
    "on each site @xmath21 , let @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the annihilation and creation operators of a spinless fermion .",
    "the hopping hamiltonian is given by @xcite h - c_^c_- -_n=^l - @xmath24 + , [ eq : rb_h ] where @xmath25 are the hopping amplitudes parametrized as ( see fig .",

    "the largest hopping is the central one , @xmath30 , and gets renormalized to @xmath31 , larger ( in absolute value ) than @xmath32 , which comes next .",
    "the values of @xmath25 are engineered so that this situation repeats itself for all steps of sdrg , so the bonds are established in a concentric way around the center , joining sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and giving rise to the aforementioned csp , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : rb_scheme ] .",
    "moreover , notice that the signs alternate .",
    "it is worth to notice the striking similarity between our system and the kondo chain @xcite .",
    "indeed , let us divide our inhomogeneous chain into three parts : central link , left sites and right sites .",
    "the left and right sites correspond , in our analogy , to the spin up and down chains used in wilson s chain representation of the kondo problem . in both cases ,",
    "they form a system of free fermions , with exponentially decaying couplings . in the kondo chain , notwithstanding , the central link becomes a magnetic impurity , which renders the full system non - gaussian .",
    "the @xmath29 limit of , leading to the rainbow state , is singular : the hamiltonian decouples in that limit , and only the central link survives . let us consider a very small but non - zero @xmath35 , and study the gs to first order in perturbation theory .",
    "the hamiltonian is always free , so the gs is a slater determinant .",
    "the orbital operators , @xmath36 , can be expanded in terms of the local creation operators :    d^_k = _ i ^k_i c^_i , [ eq : orbitals ] where @xmath37 are the wavefunction components for the single - body associated problem , i.e. , eigenvectors of the hopping matrix .",
    "let us propose the following form for them : [ eq : structure ]    notice the sign alternation , due to the negative sign in the renormalization prescription .",
    "it is straightforward to check that all those @xmath38 are eigenstates of the hopping matrix to first order in @xmath35 .",
    "we can now define two families of states : the bonding and the anti - bonding creating operators , defined as : @xmath39^&=&1 @xmath40 , + [ eq : bonding ] @xmath41^&=&1 @xmath42 .    in the limit @xmath29 , the gs of hamiltonian",

    "the extension presented in this article is based on the application of field - theory methods .",
    "we show that , in the vicinity of the conformal model , the ground state can be described by a map that is the union of the conformal maps associated to each half of the chain .",
    "the corresponding conformal transformations further suggest the definition of a temperature that is proportional to the parameter controlling the decay of the hopping parameters .",
    "we show how this deformation accounts for the change in the dispersion relation , the single - particle wavefunctions in the vicinity of the fermi point , and the half - chain von neumann and rnyi entropies .",
    "the appearance of a volume law entropy is linked to the existence of an effective temperature for the gs that is finally identified with a thermofield state .",
    "this striking result points towards an unexpected connection with the theory of black holes and the emergence of space - time from entanglement .    finally , we show how to extend the rainbow hamiltonian to several dimensions in a natural way , and check that the entanglement entropy of the two - dimensional analogue grows as the area of the block .",
