    "it suggests the relationship between the cluster size and the magnitude of particle acceleration in sense that larger clusters can produce more powerful radio emission .",

    "actually , the kolmogorov index in the power spectrum of magnetic fields has been reported ( e.g. abell 2362 , ) , indicating the existence of turbulence and amplification of the igmf by turbulence in galaxy clusters .",
    "one of the useful techniques to investigate turbulent magnetic fields is the depolarization , in which observed polarized intensity gets weaker than that at the origin arising from several mechanisms .",
    "particularly , beam depolarizations of internal faraday dispersion ( ifd ) and external faraday dispersion ( efd ) becomes significant effect , if structures of faraday rotation measure ( rm ) inside and outside a polarized radio emission source , respectively , are not uniform within an observing beam , e.g. if small eddy - sized turbulent magnetic fields exist .",

    "if the fractional polarization of the compact diffuse source is larger than that of the large diffuse source , then the fractional polarization could increase as the observing frequency increases .",
    "therefore , the variation of the fractional polarization at 33.5  ghz may be partly due to the missing flux .",
    "since the fractional polarizations of sources a and b , which are located near the radio relic , does not show the variation at @xmath44  ghz , its origin should be significant for the emission from the radio relic .",
    "indeed , because sources a and b are compact sources , the effect of the missing flux is expected to be insignificant for the emissions from sources a and b. thus , to clarify the effect of the missing flux on the fractional polarization , single dish observations at 33.5  ghz should be performed in future .    on the other hand , the variation of the fractional polarization expected at around @xmath136  ghz could not be explained by the missing flux , since the las at @xmath136 ghz or less is sufficiently larger than the the major axis of the radio relic .",
    "[ t06 ]    to6ptwe assume @xmath137 kpc since the beam size of corresponds to @xmath252 kpc .    hereafter , although the effect of the missing flux could be significant , we do not exclude the data above @xmath44  ghz in our analyses .",
    "this aims at studying the case that the variation of the fractional polarization at @xmath44  ghz is real .",
    "again , we suggest to perform single dish observations at 33.5  ghz in the future , to clarify the effect of the missing flux on the fractional polarization .",
    "figure  [ f08 ] implies that the histogram of rm follows the gaussian distribution , which is not inconsistent to consider that the beam depolarization is induced by random ( turbulent ) magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "as already described in section [ s5ss5 ] and figure  [ f05a ] , the burn s law with a single depolarization component is hard to reproduce the observed fractional polarization of the radio relic .",
    "therefore , we consider models with multiple depolarization components along the line of sight toward the radio relic .",
    "a weakness of adopting the burn s law is that we can not extract the information of magnetic fields . in order to understand the nature of depolarization as well as magnetic fields",
    ", we hence carried out simulations of depolarization using simple random - field models .",
    "we calculated the polarized emission which pass the depolarization components in the model .",
    "the components consist of grid , and each grid at the three dimensional coordinate @xmath138 ) has single - scale random magnetic fields with uniform strength .",

    "the efd+efd and ifd+ifd models can nicely reproduce the fractional polarization of the radio relic .",
    "we confirmed that we need two depolarization components to produce the step - like variations of the fractional polarization .",
    "in addition , we found that the @xmath150 of the foreside depolarization component viewed from the observer has to be smaller than the that of the backside depolarization component .",
    "we could interpret the two depolarization components of the models as follows .",
    "the foreside depolarization component viewed from the observer could be the magneto - ionic plasma in the cluster or the galaxy .",
    "the backside depolarization component should be magneto - ionic plasma inside the radio relic , according to the fact that the fractional polarization of sources a and b does not show the same variation as the fractional polarization of the radio relic . otherwise , if the cluster or the galaxy depolarizes relic s polarization , the fractional polarizations of sources a and b should also show the step - like variations . but as seen in figure  [ f05b ] , the fractional polarizations of sources a and b are nearly constant .",
    "the @xmath150 for the radio relic is larger than that for the cluster or the galaxy .",
    "although we can explain observed fractional polarization of the radio relic with our depolarization models as presented in this section , we should note that there should be more realistic model to match the observational data .",
    "for instance , shows a realistic model obtained by numerical simulations , including the magnetic field strength , radial profile , and magnetic field power spectrum of cluster of galaxies , which is successfully applied to individual clusters ( e.g. ) .",
    "we also carried out faraday tomography to make sure the existence of multiple components toward the radio relic .",

    "rcss of the two - component models are a bit far from unity . to improve the fit , data below @xmath179",

    "the fits with the two - component models commonly suggest that there are components at the faraday depth @xmath180  @xmath181",
    ". this would be the radio relic , since the depth and the thickness are respectively close to the average and the standard deviation of rm for the radio relic ( table  [ t03 ] ) .",

    "we inferred that the shift of the mean of the rm from @xmath202 to about @xmath203 toward the abell 2256 field is due to the galactic contribution since the averaged rm values of 28 polarized sources within around abell 2256 is broadly consistent with the means of rm for the radio relic , source a , and source b.    we found that the fractional polarization of the radio relic remains about 20  % between 1.33  ghz and increases above 3 ghz .",
    "the burn s law with a single depolarization component can not reproduce the observed step - like fractional polarization spectrum of the radio relic . this may be due to the missing flux and/or depolarization .",
    "our simulations of depolarization , which allow us to know three dimensional position information of the magneto - ionic plasma from the fractional polarization , indicated that two - component depolarization models can explain the step - like variations of the fractional polarization .",
