    "in general relativity ( gr ) , the curvature of the space - time is calculated using the levi - civita connection of the metric ( riemannian formalism ) .",
    "a natural way to extend gr is to allow the connection to be independent of the metric ( palatini formalism ) . in this way",
    ", the variation of the action will give raise to two sets of equations : one set coming from the variation with respect to the metric , and another set coming from the variation with respect to the independent connection . in exchange for",
    "the greater number of equations , these new systems turn out to be linear in the derivatives of the metric and connection , which contrasts with the second order derivatives of the metric in the usual riemannian approach . within the palatini formalism",
    ", this property is preserved for lagrangians nonlinear in curvature scalars , which allows us to consider higher curvature corrections to the gravity action without worrying about perturbative instabilities like ghosts .",
    "we study charged black holes in this context , focusing our attention on an action well studied in the riemannian formalism , namely , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is planck s length squared and @xmath2 a dimensionless constant .",
    "the solution for a charged black hole with this action  la palatini was first found in @xcite .",
    "this black hole solution is very similar to the reissner - nordstrm black hole of gr at scales larger than a few planck lengths away from the center . in the palatini solution",
    ", curvature divergences do not arise at the center but on a sphere of area @xmath3 .",
    "however , for a certain charge - to - mass ratio curvature divergences at @xmath4 disappear . with a convenient choice of coordinates , one finds that for these configurations the metric is completely regular and the curvature invariants are finite at @xmath4 .",
    "the geometry is that of a _ wormhole _ , the radius @xmath4 being the minimum radius where the wormhole throat lies .",
    "electric charge in this geometry arises as a topological effect resulting from the electric flux flowing through the wormhole mouth .",
    "no point - like charges are needed to generate the field .",
    "this geometry arises naturally in the palatini context and provides a nice realization of the concept of _ geon _ introduced by j. a. wheeler back in 1955 @xcite .",
    "given that the wormhole is a topologically non - trivial object , one can show that even configurations with curvature divergences at @xmath5 are indeed solutions with two sides connected at @xmath4 . in this talk",
    ", we try to improve our understanding of the wormhole structure in both regular and divergent configurations by exploring the geodesic structure of these space - times and constructing euclidean embeddings as a tool to better visualize the geometry .",
    "we start from the action : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the determinant of the space - time metric @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and the matter is coupled only to the metric and not the connection .",
    "the variation of this action with respect to metric and connection ( which are independent from each other ) gives raise to two sets of equations ( vanishing torsion ) @xmath11 & = & 0 \\label{eq : connection}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the details to solve the equations given @xmath12 and @xmath13 are given in @xcite .",
    "a quick summary goes as follows : eq .",
    "( [ eq : metric ] ) can be manipulated raising one index with the metric to show that @xmath14 can be expressed as an algebraic function of @xmath15 .",
    "being that relation a matrix equation , there might be multiple solutions .",
    "however , agreement with gr in the low curvature regime should select just one of them .",
    "tracing over the indices of @xmath16 , one finds @xmath17 , whereas @xmath18 . with these expressions , it is possible to obtain the functional form of @xmath19 and @xmath20 in terms of the matter fields and , in the case of an electric field with spherical symmetry , in terms of @xmath21 .",
    "now , with @xmath16 written in terms of the matter fields , we can write ( [ eq : connection ] ) in the form @xmath22 = 0 $ ] . here",
    "the connection appears linearly and can be solved using elementary algebraic manipulations . a simple way to see this , consists on defining an auxiliary metric @xmath23 such that the connection equation becomes @xmath24= 0 $ ] .",
    "this implies that @xmath25 is the levi - civita connection of @xmath23 , with @xmath23 and @xmath8 related by @xmath26 where @xmath27 . with this notation , it is possible to write eq .",
    "( [ eq : metric ] ) only in terms of @xmath23 ( and its derivatives ) , @xmath19 and @xmath20 as functions of @xmath21 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting equation can be integrated to obtain @xmath29 , which allows to compute @xmath8 using the relations ( [ eq : h - g ] ) .    before showing the metric solution for the particular case of @xmath30 , and the @xmath28 of electrovacuum fields , let us define some constants and factors that will appear : integration of the the equations",
    "will give a constant @xmath31 that is identified with the schwarzschild radius of the black hole .",
    "the number of charges of the black hole together with the planck length gives two characteristic lengths @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the number of charges ) and @xmath34 . with these",
    "we can define a dimensionless parameter @xmath35 that will characterize the behaviour of the black hole near the wormhole throat , and two factors @xmath36 that represent the non - zero components of the matrix @xmath37 introduced above @xmath38 with this notation , the metric takes the form @xmath39 where the area function @xmath40 and the radial coordinate @xmath41 are related as follows @xmath42 the behaviour of @xmath43 in the limit of large and small @xmath21 , respectively , is @xcite @xmath44 here @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the rapid decay of the corrections for @xmath47 puts forward that at distances slightly larger than @xmath4 the metric is essentially the same as in the reissner - nordstrm black hole of gr . for stellar size objects ,",
    "no difference with respect to gr could be seen outside the horizon or even a few planck lengths away from the center . however , as @xmath48 , the behavior changes radically and becomes strongly dependent on @xmath35 . if @xmath35 is greater than @xmath49 , there is a time - like curvature divergence . if @xmath35 is smaller than @xmath49 , the divergence is space - like . for @xmath50",
    "the geometry becomes completely smooth .",
    "moreover , if the number of charges of the black hole is less than a critical number , @xmath51 there will be no horizon hiding the hypersurface @xmath5 .",
    "[ fig : xrgraph ] illustrates why the radial function @xmath52 can not be used as a valid coordinate .",
    "when @xmath53 , the function @xmath52 has a minimum and ceases to be monotonic , which prevents it from mapping the whole domain of the solution .",
    "it is important to note that the relation between @xmath41 and @xmath52 is independent of the charge - to - mass ratio . in the regular case , @xmath50",
    ", nothing prevents extending the domain of @xmath41 to the negative axis , i.e. , @xmath54-\\infty,+\\infty[$ ] .",
    "given that the wormhole is a topological structure , thus insensitive to metric perturbations , the domain of @xmath41 must always be the same .",
    "this is further supported by the properties of the electric flux across the wormhole throat , which is independent of the charge - to - mass ratio . moreover ,",
    "the ratio of the electric flux by the area of the wormhole turns out to be a universal constant , independent of the charge and mass of the solutions .",
    "this further reinforces the topological character of the solution and the existence of _ two sides _ regardless of the existence of curvature ( metric ) divergences at the throat .     as a function of @xmath41 , in units of @xmath4 ]",
    "the geometry changes from being smooth to having divergences if @xmath35 moves infinitesimally away from the value @xmath49 .",
    "it seems shocking that such a small change can lead from something regular to something as pathological as curvature divergences are thought to be . in order to better understand the differences between such configurations , it is useful to look at the euclidean embedding of a bidimensional slice of the spacetime ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the induced metric in this slice is @xmath57 while the metric of the three - dimensional euclidean space with cylindrical symmetry in which we want to embed this slice has the form @xcite @xmath58 to find the embedding one just needs to restrict @xmath59 to be a function @xmath60 so that the line element in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2d ] ) is recovered .",
    "[ fig : xi ] shows @xmath60 for two particular cases with @xmath50 and @xmath61 ( the latter representing the analogous of a naked singularity in gr ) . in the regular case",
    "the wormhole is smooth , whereas in the @xmath61 case , there is a kind of vertex at the wormhole throat .",
    "it is worth noting that in the @xmath61 case @xmath62 is both continuous _ and _ differentiable everywhere .",
    "it is the second derivative of @xmath63 that tends to infinity as the wormhole throat is approached , causing the divergence of curvature scalars .",
    "the embeddings are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : embeddings ] .     for the regular case ( blue dotted line ) and the singular case ( red line ) ]",
    "geodesics are curves whose tangent vector is parallel transported along itself .",
    "this definition generalizes the concept of `` straight lines '' of euclidean geometry to curved geometry . according to the einstein equivalence principle , freely falling objects",
    "follow geodesics .",
    "a geodesic @xmath64 satisfies the following equation :    @xmath65    in the riemannian formalism , the affine connection that appears in the geodesic equation is the levi - civita connection of the metric .",
    "however , in the palatini formalism , the independent connection could also be used to define geodesic paths .",
    "if the theory is constructed in such a way that the connection does not couple to the matter fields ( as in our case ) , the geodesics of freely falling objects ( or of light rays ) are the ones derived from the levi - civita connection of the metric .",
    "since the geometry we are dealing with is very symmetric , it is not necessary to solve the geodesic equation .",
    "time translation symmetry gives us a conserved quantity along the geodesic @xmath66 , and spherical symmetry gives us another conserved quantity , @xmath67 .",
    "the radial component can be obtaining normalizing the tangent vector to @xmath68 or @xmath69 depending if it is a null or a time - like geodesic : @xmath70 the motion in the radial direction is analog to the motion of a particle in a one dimensional potential @xmath71 with energy @xmath72 . in this case , the energy is squared and can not take negative values .",
    "therefore , wherever the potential @xmath71 is negative , @xmath73 is necessarily different from @xmath74 and the particle is forced to cross that region .",
    "the regions where @xmath71 is negative correspond to the regions where @xmath75 is negative ( inside horizons ) and the @xmath41 coordinate becomes time - like ( the @xmath76 coordinate becomes space - like ) .",
    "the zeros of the potential correspond to the regions where @xmath75 vanishes , which occurs at the black hole horizons .",
    "radial null geodesics are characterized by @xmath68 , @xmath77 .",
    "the potential is null in this case and insensitive to the details of @xmath75 . in this case",
    ", light rays will follow their path crossing the wormhole unimpeded .",
    "the potential for null geodesics with angular momentum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nullangular ] . for large values of @xmath21 ,",
    "the geodesics feel a repulsive potential that goes like @xmath78 . near the wormhole , the behaviour of the potential depends on the value of @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath79 , the potential will reach a maximum and then go to @xmath80 as the geodesic approaches the wormhole .",
    "all geodesics with energy greater than the maximum will cross to the other side of the wormhole .",
    "if @xmath50 the potential will have a finite value at the wormhole throat and reach a maximum before that .",
    "the potential at the wormhole throat is a minimum , and there will be stable light orbits if the value of the potential is positive ( which happens when @xmath51 ) . if @xmath61 , the potential will go to @xmath81 as the geodesic approaches the wormhole throat . as a consequence , all geodesics will be repelled and none will cross the wormhole .    the potential for radial time - like geodesics is shown in fig . [ fig : temporalradial ] . in this case , for large values of @xmath21 , the geodesics feel an attractive potential that goes like @xmath82 .",
    "the behavior near the wormhole depends on @xmath35 and is similar to the previous case . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the potential goes to @xmath80 at the wormhole throat and the geodesics will cross to the other side . for @xmath50 , the potential will be finite , and there will be stable orbits at the throat if @xmath51 . if @xmath61 , the potential will diverge to @xmath81 and the geodesics will bounce back .",
    "we have shown that charged black holes for a @xmath12 gravity theory in the palatini formalism possess a wormhole structure .",
