    "in 1967 , anderson considered the response of a fermi sea to a change in local scattering potential and made the following observation : @xcite the ground states @xmath0 and @xmath11 of the hamiltonians @xmath12 and @xmath13 describing the system before and after the change , respectively , become orthogonal in the thermodynamic limit , decaying with total particle number @xmath2 as @xmath14 because the single - particle states comprising the two fermi seas are characterized by different phase shifts .",
    "whenever the anderson orthogonality ( ao ) exponent @xmath5 is finite , the overlap of the two ground state wave functions goes to zero as the system size becomes macroscopic . as a consequence ,",
    "matrix elements of the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a local operator acting at the site of the localized potential , necessarily also vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this fact has far - reaching consequences , underlying several fundamental phenomena in condensed matter physics involving quantum impurity models , models describing a fermi sea coupled to localized quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "examples are the mahan exciton ( me ) and the fermi - edge singularity ( fes ) @xcite in absorption spectra , and the kondo effect @xcite arising in magnetic alloys @xcite or in transport through quantum dots .",
    "@xcite for all of these , the low - temperature dynamics is governed by the response of the fermi sea to a sudden switch of a local scattering potential .",
    "more recently , there has also been growing interest in inducing such a sudden switch , or quantum quench , by optical excitations of a quantum dot tunnel - coupled to a fermi sea , in which case the post - quench dynamics leaves fingerprints , characteristic of ao , in the optical absorption or emission line shape .",
    "@xcite    the intrinsic connection of local quantum quenches to the scaling of the anderson orthogonality with system size can be intuitively understood as follows .",
    "consider an instantaneous event at the location of the impurity at time @xmath17 in a system initially in equilibrium .",
    "this local perturbation will spread out spatially , such that for @xmath18 , the initial wave function is affected only within a radius @xmath19 of the impurity , with @xmath20 the fermi velocity . the ao finite - size scaling in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi12 ] ) therefore directly resembles the actual experimental situation , and in particular allows the exponent @xmath5 to be directly related to the exponents seen in experimental observables at long time scales , or at the threshold frequency in fourier space.@xcite    a powerful numerical tool for studying quantum impurity models is the numerical renormalization group ( nrg),@xcite which allows numerous static and dynamical quantities to be calculated explicitly , also in the thermodynamic limit of infinite bath size .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to point out that nrg also offers a completely straightforward way to calculate the overlap @xmath21 and hence to extract @xmath5 .",
    "the advantage of using nrg for this purpose is that nrg is able to deal with quantum impurity models that in general also involve local _ interactions _ , which are usually not tractable analytically .",
    "although anderson himself did not include local interactions in his considerations,@xcite his prediction ( [ eq : psi12 ] ) still applies , provided the ground states @xmath22 describe fermi liquids .",
    "this is the case for most impurity models ( but not all ; the two - channel kondo model is a notable exception ) .",
    "another useful feature of nrg is that it allows consistency checks on its results for overlap decays , since @xmath5 is known to be related to a change of scattering phase shifts at the fermi surface .",
    "these phase shifts can be calculated independently , either from nrg energy flow diagrams , or via friedel s sum rule from the displaced charge , as will be elaborated below .",
    "a further concrete motivation for the present study is to develop a convenient tool for calculating ao exponents for quantum dot models that display the phenomenon of population switching . @xcite in such models , a quantum dot tunnel - coupled to leads contains levels of different widths , and is capacitively coupled to a gate voltage that shifts the levels energy relative to the fermi level of the leads . under suitable conditions ,",
    "an ( adiabatic ) sweep of the gate voltage induces an inversion in the population of these levels ( a so called population switch ) , implying a change in the local potential seen by the fermi seas in the leads . in this paper",
    ", we verify that the method of extracting @xmath5 from @xmath23 works reliably also for such models . in a separate publication @xcite we will use this method to analyze whether ao can lead to a quantum phase transition in such models , as suggested in ref .  .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : ao ] we define the ao exponent @xmath5 in general terms , and explain in sec .  [ sec : nrg ] how nrg can be used to calculate it .",
    "[ sec : results ] presents numerical results for several interacting quantum dot models of increasing complexity : first the spinless interacting resonant level model ( irlm ) , then the single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) , followed by two models exhibiting population switching , one for spinless , the other for spinful electrons . in all cases , our results",
    "for @xmath5 satisfy all consistency checks to within less than 1% .",
    "to set the stage , let us review ao in the context of a free fermi sea involving a single species or channel of noninteracting electrons experiencing two different local scattering potentials .",
    "the initial and final systems are described in full by the hamiltonians @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath24 be the single - particle eigenstates of @xmath25 characterized by the scattering phase shifts @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are fermion creation operators , and let @xmath29 be the same fermi energy for both fermi seas @xmath30 .",
    "anderson showed that in the thermodynamic limit of large particle number , @xmath4 , the overlap @xmath31 decays as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi12 ] ) , @xcite where @xmath5 is equal to the difference in single - particle phase shifts at the fermi level , @xmath32 / \\pi \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : ao - phaseshift}\\ ] ] the relative sign between @xmath5 and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 , not @xmath35 ) does not affect the orthogonality exponent @xmath36 , but follows standard convention [ ref .  , eq .",
    "( 7 ) , or ref .  , eq .  ( 21 ) ] .",
    "in this paper we will compare three independent ways of calculating @xmath5 .",
    "( i ) the first approach calculates the overlap @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi12 ] ) explicitly as a function of ( effective ) system size .",
    "the main novelty of the present paper is to point out that this can easily be done in the framework of nrg , as will be explained in detail in section  [ sec : nrg ] .",
    "\\(ii ) the second approach is to directly calculate @xmath33 via eq .",
    "( [ eq : ao - phaseshift ] ) , since the extraction of phase shifts @xmath38 from nrg finite - size spectra is well - known : @xcite provided that @xmath25 describes a fermi liquid , the ( suitably normalized ) fixed point spectrum of nrg can be reconstructed in terms of equidistant free - particle levels shifted by an amount determined by @xmath39 .",
    "the many - body excitation energy of an additional particle , a hole and a particle - hole pair thus allow the phase shift @xmath40 to be determined unambiguously .",
    "\\(iii ) the third approach exploits friedel s sum rule,@xcite which relates the difference in phase shifts to the so called _ displaced charge _",
    "@xmath41 via @xmath42 . here",
    "the displaced charge @xmath41 is defined as the charge in units of @xmath43 ( the number of electrons ) flowing inward from infinity into a region of large but finite volume , say @xmath44 , surrounding the scattering location , upon switching from @xmath12 to @xmath13 : @xmath45 here @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the total number of fermi see electrons within @xmath44 , whereas @xmath48 is the local charge of the scattering site , henceforth called `` dot '' .",
    "to summarize , we have the equalities @xmath49 where all three quantities can be calculated independently and straightforwardly within the nrg .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : consistency ] ) constitutes a strong consistency check",
    ". we will demonstrate below that nrg results satisfy this check with good accuracy ( deviations are typically below 1% ) .",
    "we will also consider models involving several independent and conserved channels ( spin in spin - conserving models ) . in the absence of interactions ,",
    "the overall ground state wave function is the product of those of the individual channels . with respect to ao",
    ", this trivially implies that each channel _ adds _ independently to the ao exponent in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi12 ] ) , @xmath50 where @xmath51 labels the @xmath52 different channels . we will demonstrate below that the additive character in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dao_add ] ) generalizes to systems with _ local interactions _ , provided that the particle number in each channel remains conserved .",
    "this is remarkable , since interactions may cause the ground state wave function to involve entanglement between local and fermi sea degrees of freedom from different channels .",
    "however , our results imply that the asymptotic tails of the ground state wave function far from the dot still factorize into a product of factors from individual channels .",
    "in particular , we will calculate the displaced charge for each individual channel , eq .",
    "( [ eq : displacedcharge ] ) , @xmath53 where @xmath54 . assuming no interactions in the respective fermi seas",
    ", it follows from friedel s sum rule that @xmath55 , and therefore @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the total sum of the squares of the displaced charges of the separate channels .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : dcharge_add ] ) holds with great numerical accuracy , too , as will be shown below .",
    "the problem of a noninteracting fermi sea in the presence of a local scatterer belongs to the general class of quantum impurity models treatable by wilson s nrg.@xcite our proposed approach for calculating @xmath5 applies to _ any _ impurity model treatable by nrg . to be specific , however",
    ", we will focus here on generalized anderson impurity type models .",
    "they describe @xmath52 different ( and conserved ) species or channels of fermions that hybridize with local degrees of freedom at the dot , while all interaction terms are local .",
    "we take both the initial and final ( @xmath58 ) hamiltonians to have the generic form @xmath59 . the first term",
    ", @xmath60 describes a noninteracting fermi sea involving @xmath52 channels .",
    "( @xmath52 includes the spin index , if present . ) for simplicity , we assume a constant density of states @xmath61 for each channel with half - bandwidth @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , when representing numerical results , energies will be measured in units of half - bandwidth , hence @xmath63 .",
    "the fermi sea is assumed to couple to the dot only via the local operators @xmath64 and @xmath65 , that , respectively , annihilate or create a fermi sea electron of channel @xmath66 at the position of the dot , @xmath67 , with a proper normalization constant @xmath68 to ensure @xmath69 = \\delta_{\\mu \\mu'}$ ] .",
    "the second term , @xmath70 , contains the non - interacting local part of the hamiltonian , including the dot - lead hybridization , @xmath71 \\text { . }",
    "\\label{eq : hd_general}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath72 is the energy of dot level @xmath66 in the initial or final configuration , and @xmath73 is its electron number .",
    "@xmath74 is the effective width of level @xmath66 induced by its hybridization with channel @xmath66 of the fermi sea , with @xmath75 the @xmath66-conserving matrix element connecting the d - level with the bath states @xmath76 , taken independent of energy , for simplicity .",
    "finally , the interacting third term is given in the case of the single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) by the uniform coulomb interaction @xmath77 at the impurity , @xmath78 with @xmath79 , while in case of the interacting resonant level model ( irlm ) , the interacting part is given by @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "in particular , most of our results are for the one- or two - lead versions of the siam for spinful or spinless electrons , @xmath82 we consider either a single dot - level coupled to a single lead ( spinfull , @xmath83 ) , or a dot with two levels coupled separately to two leads ( spinless , @xmath84 ; spinfull , @xmath85 ) . a splitting of the energies @xmath72 in the spin label ( if any ) , will be referred to as magnetic field @xmath86",
    ". we also present some results for the irlm , for a single channel of spinless electrons ( @xmath87 ) : @xmath88    in this paper , we focus on the case that @xmath89 and @xmath90 differ only in the local level positions ( @xmath91 )",
    ". it is emphasized , however , that our methods are equally applicable for differences between initial and final values of any other parameters , including the case that the interactions are channel - specific , @xmath92 or @xmath93 .",
    "wilson discretized the spectrum of @xmath94 on a logarithmic grid of energies @xmath95 ( with @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) , thereby obtaining exponentially high resolution of low - energy excitations .",
    "he then mapped the impurity model onto a semi - infinite `` wilson tight - binding chain '' of sites @xmath98 to @xmath99 , with the impurity degrees of freedom coupled only to site 0 . to this end",
    ", he made a basis transformation from the set of sea operators @xmath100 to a new set @xmath101 , chosen such that they bring @xmath94 into the tridiagonal form @xmath102 the hopping matrix elements @xmath103 decrease exponentially with site index @xmath6 along the chain .",
    "because of this separation of energy scales , the hamiltonian can be diagonalized iteratively by solving a wilson chain of length @xmath6 ( restricting the sum in eq .  ( [ eq : wilsonchainh0 ] ) to the first @xmath6 terms ) and increasing @xmath6 one site at a time : starting with a short wilson chain , a new _ shell _ of many - body eigenstates for a wilson chain of length @xmath6 , say @xmath104 , is constructed from the states of site @xmath6 and the @xmath105 lowest - lying eigenstates of shell @xmath106 .",
    "the latter are the so called _ kept _",
    "states @xmath107 of shell @xmath106 , while the remaining higher - lying states @xmath108 from that shell are _",
    "discarded_.    the typical spacing between the few lowest - lying states of shell @xmath6 , the energy scale @xmath109 ,",
    "is set by the hopping matrix element @xmath110 to the previous site , hence @xmath111 now , for a noninteracting fermi sea with @xmath2 particles , the mean single - particle level spacing at the fermi energy scales as @xmath112 .",
    "this also sets the energy scale for the mean level spacing of the few lowest - lying many - body excitations of the fermi sea .",
    "equating this to eq .",
    "( [ eq : meanlevelspacingshellk ] ) , we conclude that a wilson chain of length @xmath6 represents a fermi sea with an actual size @xmath113 , an _ effective _ number of electrons @xmath2 , that grows _ exponentially _ with @xmath6 , @xmath114    now consider two impurity models that differ only in their local terms @xmath70 , and let @xmath115 be the ground states of their respective wilson chains of length @xmath6 , obtained via two separate nrg runs .",
    "@xcite combining anderson s prediction ( [ eq : psi12 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlscaling ] ) , the ground state overlap is expected to decay exponentially with @xmath6 as @xmath116 with @xmath117 thus the ao exponent can be determined by using nrg to _ directly _ calculate the of eq .",

    "a finite wilson chain represents a single - particle hamiltonian for a finite number of degrees of freedom that can readily be diagonalized numerically , without the need for implementing nrg truncation .",
    "the ground state is a slater determinant of those single - particle eigenstates that are occupied in the fermi sea .",
    "the overlap @xmath119 is then given simply by the determinant of a matrix whose elements are overlaps between the @xmath120- and @xmath121-versions of the occupied single - particle states .",
    "it is easy to confirm numerically in this manner that @xmath122 , leading to the expected ao in the limit @xmath123 .",
    "we will thus focus on interacting models henceforth , that require the use of nrg .    in the following three subsections , we discuss several technical aspects needed for calculating ao with nrg on wilson chains .      the calculation of state space overlaps within the nrg is straightforward in principle@xcite , especially considering its underlying matrix product state structure @xcite .",
    "now , the overlap in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi12_wilson ] ) that needs to be calculated in this paper , is with respect to ground states as function of wilson chain length @xmath6 . as such",
    ", two complications can arise .",
    "( i ) for a given @xmath6 , the system can have several degenerate ground states @xmath124 , with the degeneracy @xmath125 typically different for even and odd @xmath6 .",
    "( ii ) the symmetry of the ground state space may actually differ with alternating @xmath6 between certain initial and final configurations , @xmath126 , leading to strictly zero overlap there . a natural way to deal with ( i ) ,",

    "[ fig : siam ] )  several alternative measures for calculating the ao - overlap are shown , using @xmath133 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : genoverlap ] ) with @xmath134 , as defined in the text .",
    "all overlaps are plotted for even and odd iterations separately to account for possible even - odd behavior within the wilson chain ( thin solid lines with dots , and dashed lines , respectively , while heavy symbols identify lines with corresponding legends ) .",
    "if even and odd data from the same @xmath133 do not lie on the same smooth line , the combined data is also plotted ( light zigzag lines ) as guides to the eye . for large @xmath6 , all ao - overlaps exhibit exponential decay of equal strength .",
    "separate fits of @xmath135 to even and odd sectors are shown as thick solid lines , whose lengths indicate the fitting range used . the values for @xmath36 extracted from these fits using eq .",
    "( [ def.alpha ] ) are in excellent agreement with the displaced charge @xmath57 , as expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dcharge_add ] ) . the relative error is less than 1% throughout , with the detailed values specified in the legend , and @xmath136 representing the averaged value the four measures considered . ]",
    "the @xmath125-fold degenerate ground state subspace is described by its projector , written in terms of the fully mixed density matrix , @xmath137 it is then convenient to calculate the overlap of the ground state space as follows , @xmath138 where @xmath139 refers to the trace over the kept space at iteration @xmath6 of the final system .",
    "the final expression can be interpreted , up to the prefactor , as the square of the frobenius norm of the overlap matrix @xmath140 between the nrg states @xmath141 and @xmath142 at iteration @xmath6 for the initial and final hamiltonian , respectively .",
    "note that the specific overlap in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_overlap ] ) , as used throughout later in this paper , not only includes the ground space of the final system at iteration @xmath6 , but rather includes the _ full kept space _ of that system . yet each such overlap scales as @xmath143 , with the same exponent @xmath8 for all combinations of @xmath144 and @xmath145 , because ( i ) the states @xmath146 with @xmath147 are taken from the initial ground state space , and ( ii ) the states @xmath148 with @xmath149 from the final kept shell differ from a final ground state only by a small number of excitations .",
    "therefore , eq . ( 21 ) is essentially equivalent , up to an irrelevant prefactor , to strictly taking the overlap of ground state spaces as in @xmath150 .",
    "this will be shown in more detail in the following .",
    "in particular , the overlap in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_overlap ] ) can be easily generalized to @xmath151 where @xmath134 represents the ground state space , the full kept space , or the ground state taken at @xmath152 with respect to either initial or final system , respectively . the overlap @xmath153 in eq .",

    "the topmost line ( identified with legend by heavy round dot ) shows the overlap eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlap ] ) used as default for calculating the overlap in the rest of the paper .",
    "this measure is most convenient , as it reliably provides data with a smooth @xmath6-dependence for large @xmath6 , insensitive to alternating @xmath6-dependent changes of the symmetry sector and degeneracy of the ground state sector of @xmath158 ( note that the exact ground state symmetry is somewhat relative within the nrg framework , given an essentially gapless continuum of states of the full system ) .",
    "the overlap @xmath159 ( data marked by triangle ) gives the overlap of the initial and final _ ground state _",
    "spaces , but is sensitive to changes in symmetry sector ; in particular , for @xmath160 it is nonzero for odd iterations only .",
    "the reason why it can be vanishingly small for certain iterations is , in the present case , that the initial and final occupancies of the local level differ significantly , as seen from the values for @xmath161 and @xmath162 specified in the panel .",
    "therefore , initial and final ground states can be essentially orthogonal , in the worst case throughout the entire nrg run .",
    "nonetheless , the ao - exponent is expected to be well - defined and finite , as reflected in @xmath163 .",
    "the ao - measure @xmath164 ( data marked by star ) is smooth throughout , and although it is not strictly constrained to the ground state space at a given iteration , in either initial or final system , it gives the correct ao exponent , the reason being the underlying energy scale separation of the nrg .",
    "finally , @xmath165 ( data marked by squares ) refers to an ao - measure that calculates the overlap of the ground state space of an essentially infinite initial system ( @xmath166 , or in practice , the last site of the wilson chain ) , with the kept space at iteration @xmath6 of the final system . since the latter experiences @xmath6-dependent even - odd differences , whereas the initial density matrix @xmath167 is independent of @xmath6 , @xmath168 exhibits rather strong @xmath6-dependent oscillations .",
    "nevertheless , their envelopes for even and odd iterations separately decay with the same exponent @xmath8 as the other ao - measures .    in summary , fig .",
    "[ fig : nrg ] demonstrates that all ao - measures decay asymptotically as @xmath135 , as expected from eq .",

    "this equation is based on the assumption ( whose validity for the models studied here is borne out by the results presented below ) that for distances sufficiently far from the dot , the asymptotic tail of the ground state wave function factorizes , in effect , into independent products , one for each channel @xmath66 .",
    "this can be exploited to calculate , in a straightforward fashion , the individual exponent @xmath170 for a given channel @xmath66 : one simply constructs a modified wilson chain which , in effect , is much longer for channel @xmath66 than for all others . the overlap decay for large @xmath6",
    "is then dominated by that channel .",
    "to be explicit , the strategy is as follows .",
    "first we need to determine when a wilson chain is `` sufficiently long '' to capture the aforementioned factorization of ground state tails",
    ". this will be the case beyond that chain length , say @xmath171 , for which the nrg energy flow diagrams for the kept space excitation spectra of the original hamiltonians @xmath172 and @xmath173 are well converged to their @xmath174 fixed points values . to calculate @xmath170 , the ao exponent of channel @xmath66",
    ", we then add an artificial term to the hamiltonian that in effect depletes the wilson chain beyond site @xmath171 for all other channels @xmath175 , by drastically raising the energy cost for occupying these sites .",
    "this term has the form @xmath176 with @xmath177 .",
    "it ensures that occupied sites in the channels @xmath178 have much larger energy than the original energy scale @xmath179 , so that they do not contribute to the low - energy states of the hamiltonian .",
    "we then calculate a suitable ao - measure ( such as @xmath163 ) using only @xmath6-values in the range @xmath180 . from the exponential decay found in this range ,",
