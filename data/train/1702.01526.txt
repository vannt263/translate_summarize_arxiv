    "<S> in this paper we construct the mbius domain wall fermions ( mdwf ) in the schrdinger functional ( sf ) scheme for the su(3 ) gauge theory by adding a boundary operator at the temporal boundary of the sf scheme setup and investigate the property using the perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the mdwfs we investigated include the optimal type domain wall , the overlap , the truncated domain wall , and the truncated overlap fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the universality of the spectrum of the effective four - dimensional operator at the tree - level . </S>",
    "<S> the fermionic contribution to the universal one - loop beta function is reproduced for the mdwfs with a sufficiently large fifth dimensional extent . </S>"
