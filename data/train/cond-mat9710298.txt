    "critical phenomena @xcite in anisotropic systems without equivalent nearest neighbors constitute an interesting research topic @xcite . a universal formula for percolation thresholds , that involves the dimension of the anisotropic lattice and an arithmetic average of the coordination number for different anisotropic lattices , has been recently postulated in ref.@xcite .",
    "the extension of these studies to more complex problems , such as directed percolation ( dp ) , and more complex systems , such as anisotropic random systems , is yet to be addressed . in this context ,",
    "random systems are good candidates to model anisotropy since they do not have equivalent nearest neighbors nor equivalent sites at all lengths .    in this work",
    "we propose a simple simulation model to study the properties of dp in two - dimensional ( 2d ) anisotropic random media .",
    "the degree of anisotropy is computed by means of the ratio @xmath3 between the axes of a semi - ellipse enclosing the bonds that promote percolation in one direction , such that @xmath4 ( see fig.1 ) . as a function of the order parameter @xmath0 and at the percolation threshold , we measure the correlation length exponent @xmath5 and the fractal dimension @xmath6 of the largest percolating clusters ( in systems of up to 51200 random sites ) . in the present model ,",
    "the well - known scaling exponents of isotropic dp follow by simply setting @xmath2 .    at percolation threshold ,",
    "our model shows that the average number of bonds per site for dp in anisotropic 2d random systems is an invariant ( @xmath7 ) independently of @xmath0 .",
    "this result suggests that the sinai theorem , proposed originally for isotropic percolation ( ip ) , is also valid for anisotropic dp problems .",
    "the new invariant also yields a constant @xmath1 for all @xmath0 , which corresponds to the value of isotropic dp .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we outline our model . in sec.iii , we present the results of our simulations and discuss the effects of @xmath0 on the scaling exponents .",
    "in order to simulate dp in 2d anisotropic random media we develop a simulation algorithm similar to the one used in ref.@xcite .",
    "the coordinates of @xmath8 sites are generated at random in a square box of size @xmath9 .",
    "the simulation length unit is chosen such that the density of sites , namely @xmath10 , in the box is always unity regardless of the total number of sites @xmath8 .",
    "the percolation is then checked over sites from the left edge towards the right edge of the simulation box ( _ i.e. _ , along the x - axis in fig.1 ) . a periodical boundary condition is applied in the vertical @xmath11-direction .    in fig.1 we show a ` particle ' that moves from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "the moving is allowed whenever the site @xmath13 is contained within the shaded elliptical area . in our simulations , the degree of anisotropy is given by the parameter @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the longer and @xmath16 is the shorter axis of a semi - ellipse , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath0 is the ratio of the maximum ` hopping distances ' along the @xmath17- and @xmath11-axes .    in the standard 2d isotropic dp",
    "there are three possible equivalent directions to move : up , down and forward .",
    "this situation in our model is attained by setting @xmath0 = 1 . in the limit @xmath18",
    ", the model tends to the one - dimensional ( 1d ) percolation problem .",
    "thus , simulation results using the present 2d percolation model will reveal features of the crossover from the standard ( say , isotropic ) dp to the 1d percolation problem . for intermediate values of @xmath19",
    "our model features anisotropic dp .    for a given value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath0 and for a given realization of random site coordinates @xmath20 , in a sample of size @xmath21 , we study percolation from the left- to the right- simulation box edge . at the percolation threshold , we obtain the critical value of the semi - ellipse - axis @xmath16 : @xmath22 and the mass @xmath23 of the critical cluster : @xmath24 = `` _ total number of sites belonging to the largest cluster at percolation _ '' .",
    "these quantities , are then averaged over a great number @xmath25 of random realizations of site coordinates for the same sample size @xmath8 which result on the average quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .    in general , the dependence of the averages @xmath28 and @xmath29 on the samples size @xmath8 is a consequence of the finite size effects of the percolation problem . in order to quantify these effects ,",
    "the present simulations were performed at different @xmath8 = 400 , 800 , 1600 , 3200 , 6400 , 12800 , 25600 and 51200 .",
    "accordingly , the number @xmath25 decreases from @xmath30 to @xmath31 such that the product of the numbers @xmath32 is approximately the same for all sample sizes @xmath8 in our study .    along with these average quantities ,",
    "we also calculate the moments @xmath33^{2 } > ^{1/2 } \\;\\;\\ ; ,                             \\;\\;\\ ; \\label{eq : delta } \\\\",
    "\\delta m(n ) & = & < [ m(n ) - { \\cal m}(n)]^{2 } > ^{1/2 } \\;\\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and also the next - order moments , which are used to estimate the statistical errors of our simulation results .    the present measurements are performed for various values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 . as can be seen from the results discussed in the next section ,",
    "the greater the value of @xmath0 , the stronger the finite size effects are .",
    "we verify that for @xmath36 simulations can only been carried out in samples of size @xmath37 .    following the well - known finite - size scaling procedure suggested in ref.@xcite",
    ", the critical exponent @xmath5 of the percolation problem is defined from the scaling expression @xmath38 where @xmath39 is given in eq.([eq : delta ] ) .",
    "note that in the present study percolation is checked by the longitudinal direction only ( the @xmath17-axes in fig.1 ) , then the exponent @xmath5 in eq.([eq : mu ] ) should be identified with the parallel @xmath40 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fig.2(a ) the quantities @xmath41 are plotted versus @xmath42 for different values of the order parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the slopes of the fitting lines give the corresponding values for the exponent .",
    "thus we found that for the largest @xmath43 , @xmath44 and for @xmath45 we measured @xmath46 .",
    "other values are given in the figure . from these calculated moments and the linear fitting procedure",
    ", we estimate the statistical error to be less than @xmath47 for all values of @xmath5 shown in this figure .",
    "results for the dp limiting case @xmath2 has been previously reported by one of us @xcite . in this case , the value @xmath48 is known as the universal value of @xmath40 for a whole class of istropic dp models in 2d . as the amount of anisotropy increases , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath49 , the correlation length exponent @xmath5 decreases .",
    "since this decrease is initially very fast to then become smoothly , it is not possible to obtain the whole crossover from 2d to 1d directed percolation for the behaviour of @xmath5 .",
    "that is , the decrease from @xmath50 in 2d - dp to the limit @xmath51 in 1d is limited by the size of our simulation box .",
    "the finite - size effects in correspondence to the different values of @xmath0 ( and , therefore , to the different degrees of anisotropy in the 2d random systems ) are in fact equivalent to those discussed in great detail in refs.@xcite for anisotropic percolation and isotropic dp .    by using the values of @xmath5 in fig.2(a ) ,",
    "the critical ` _ radius _ ' @xmath52 is determined from the scaling expression @xmath53 are plotted versus @xmath54 . from these plots",
    "we obtain @xmath55 by taking the asymptotic values @xmath56 for all @xmath0 studied .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath55 are also shown in this figure .",
    "very remarkably , our simulations show that for all @xmath0 considered the quantity @xmath57 is in fact a constant .",
    "since @xmath58 is the area of the critical semi - ellipse at percolation , then our results suggests that sinai s theorem @xcite , proposed originally for ip , is also valid for 2d anisotropic dp problems . in this respect",
    ", we emphasize again that our length unit should be taken as @xmath59 for a system with site concentration @xmath10 .",
    "thus , our simulations leads to the new invariance @xmath60 where @xmath10 is the site concentration ( _ e.g. _ , the donor concentration in doped semiconductors ) , @xmath61 is the area of the critical semi - ellipse and @xmath62 is the mean number of connected bonds per site at percolation .",
    "the invariance of eq.([eq : inv ] ) may be somehow related to the fractal behavior of the critical clusters as we shall discuss below .",
    "let us determine first the fractal dimension @xmath6 of the critical percolation cluster using a standard procedure based on the scaling expression @xcite @xmath63 in fig.2(b ) the quantities @xmath64 are plotted against @xmath65 for different values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath0 .",
    "very surprisingly we found that the fractal dimensions @xmath6 , as determined from the slopes of the fitting lines for various values of @xmath0 in fig.2(b ) , seem indeed to be constant and independent of @xmath0 within our simulation errors .",
    "we estimate @xmath66 for all @xmath0 , which corresponds to about the same value of the isotropic dp model with @xmath2 .    at a first glance",
    "this result might rise some doubts , but we believe it can be understood in connection with the invariant given in eq.([eq : inv ] ) .",
    "the invariance of @xmath62 , with respect to changes in the anisotropy parameter @xmath0 , implies that the average number of connected bonds at percolation is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "if we assume the percolation process within an elementary semi - ellipse ( as in fig.1 ) to be the ` originating percolation rule ' , then the invariance of eq.([eq : inv ] ) could mean that the law to generate percolation clusters remains unchanged as @xmath0 varies .",
    "if this conjecture is right , we could suggest here a more general statement for all types of percolation models which are related to each other by the sinai theorem ; in these cases , the fractal dimensions of the percolation clusters could all be the same .",
    "it should be noted that our simulations are limited to @xmath67 .",
    "it is in this range that we observed the invariance of @xmath68 and the constant value for @xmath6 .",
    "we believe that these features are maintained for a larger range of @xmath0 values .",
    "however , it is not feasible to increase @xmath0 and the sample size @xmath8 simultaneously and get to the point where the present 2d simulation model crosses to the 1d case ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath69 ) .    to conclude ,",
    "we have suggested a model for anisotropic directed percolation ( adp ) and have presented the first simulation results for the main critical exponents of the model in 2d random systems .",
    "quite surprisingly , we have found a new invariance for the average number of connected bonds at percolation due to presence of a suitable external force ( _ e.g. _ , shear stress , magnetic field , _ etc _ ) .",
    "our simulations show that the product @xmath70 is a constant for all @xmath0 s considered .",
    "this invariance should be in close relation to the value of @xmath6 .",
    "we strongly believe the present model of adp could be important to describe some physical phenomena such as hopping conduction in anisotropic @xmath10-ge and @xmath10-si under strong electrical fields , where the impurity wave functions are anisotropic and the conduction band splits into one ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "our measurements could be useful , for instance , in the expressions for the hopping resistivity in 2d anisotropic random media .",
    "the new invariance @xmath71 could be used in these systems similarly to the invariance @xmath72 for ip in a circle problem @xcite .",
    "we hope the present model will stimulate further investigations on this direction .",
