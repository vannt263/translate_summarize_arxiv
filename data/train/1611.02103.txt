    "blazars are a radio - loud subclass of active galactic nuclei , where the relativistic jet points directly at earth .",
    "blazars are characterized by two broad components in their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the first one peaking between ir and x - ray energies is attributed to synchrotron emission of highly relativistic electrons , while the second component , which peaks between mev and tev @xmath1-ray energies , is attributed to inverse compton emission of the same electron population .",
    "we will concentrate here on this so - called leptonic emission model , which neglects possible contributions by hadronic interactions .",
    "blazars can be divided into two main categories depending on whether or not they exhibit broad optical emission lines ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "bl lac objects are generally devoid of broad emission lines",
    ". they may be further characterized by the peak position of their synchrotron component in the sed .",
    "low - energy peaked bl lac objects ( lbls ) exhibit the synchrotron maximum below @xmath3hz , while intermediate - energy peaked bl lac objects peak between @xmath3hz and @xmath4hz , and high - energy peaked bl lac objects peak above @xmath4hz .",
    "the blazar ap librae , located at a redshift @xmath5 and at @xmath6 , @xmath7 , exhibits a monotonically increasing x - ray energy spectrum .",
    "this in combination with the lack of optical emission lines has led to its classification as an lbl .",
    "interestingly , some observational features of this source do not fit into this category .",
    "since the synchrotron component of lbls peaks below @xmath3hz and the x - rays are produced by the inverse compton ( ic ) process , the maximum electron lorentz factor in the electron energy distribution can not significantly exceed @xmath8 for reasonable values of the magnetic field strength on the order of @xmath9 g .",
    "hence , one would not expect very high energy @xmath1-ray ( vhe , @xmath10gev ) emission from lbls .",
    "surprisingly , ap librae has been clearly detected by observations with the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescope array @xcite , and the sed extends to energies of a few tev .",
    "currently , ap librae is the only lbl listed in the tevcat , a catalog that gathers all sources detected above @xmath11gev . despite selection biases ,",
    "this makes ap librae an exceptional source .",
    "high resolution x - ray observations led to the detection of extended x - ray jets in many agn . however , due to the small viewing angle , it is surprising to observe extended x - ray emission in blazars .",
    "an extended x - ray jet has been detected in ap librae by @xcite , which has thus become one of only six bl lac objects listed in the x - jet database .",
    "of these six objects three exhibit a synchrotron dominated x - ray spectrum , while the other three , including ap librae , are ic dominated .",
    "the x - ray morphology of ap librae s jet follows exactly the radio morphology as observed with the vla .",
    "the detection of the extended x - ray jet further demonstrates ap librae s peculiarity .",
    "the detection in vhe implies an extremely broad high energetic component spanning more than 10 orders of magnitude in energy . since the synchrotron emission cuts off below the x - ray band",
    ", the resulting narrow electron distribution can not explain the broad ic component in the usual one - zone blazar model .    in this proceeding , we summarize our recent result @xcite that the extended jet dominates the total sed in the vhe @xmath1-ray regime .",
    "our model explains the vhe emission as originating mostly from the extended jet .",
    "we describe only the important observations , which are necessary for our jet model .",
    "the remaining multiwavelength data is taken from the following papers or publicly available data bases : radio @xcite , and ir / optical / uv @xcite .",
    "vla observations @xcite at @xmath12ghz led to the detection of the extended jet on arcsec - scales emerging in a south - westerly direction .",
    "beyond @xmath13arcsec the jet bends to the north - west for another @xmath14arcsec .",
    "the spectral point of the extended radio jet is marked by the blue square at @xmath12ghz .",
    "the mojave program @xcite utilizes vlbi radio observations at @xmath15ghz to monitor blazars on milli - arcsec scales over long time periods .",
    "ap librae was observed in this program over the course of @xmath16 years .",
    "the data set reveals a steady core component ( `` component 0 '' ) , which is weakly variable ( flux within a factor of 2 ) .",
    "its flux is marked with the open diamond in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] .",
    "furthermore , a continuous jet is measured on scales of @xmath17milli - arcsec , which emerges in a southerly direction . beyond this scale only knots in a south - westerly direction",
    "are detected .",
    "this is the same position angle as seen for the arcsec scale jet from the vla observations .",
    "the total flux ( containing both the component 0 and the extended flux ) obtained from the mojave data fits with the spectrum of the non - vlbi radio data ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "hence , these data points are influenced by the extended component proving a usually made assumption of radio flux points of blazars .",
    "the movement of the fastest knots led to the determination of a maximum apparent speed of the jet of @xmath18 .",
    "x - ray observations with chandra revealed the extended jet on arcsec scales @xcite .",
    "the photon index of the jet is @xmath19 ; thus indicating an ic dominance in this spectral regime .",
    "the spectral points are marked by blue squares in figure [ fig : sed ] .",
    "the morphological structure is very similar to the radio morphology of the vla observation .",
    "the chandra spectrum of the core is also hard with @xmath20 .",
    "a 100-month average of observations with the swift - bat instrument @xcite reveals a flux level of the hard x - rays that is in straight extrapolation of the chandra core spectrum .",
    "thus , the core x - ray spectrum can be described by a single power - law over more than 2 orders of magnitude in energy .",
    "due to a lack of spatial resolution of the @xmath1-ray instruments , the jet can not be resolved .",
    "data from fermi and h.e.s.s . are taken from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-ray sed can be described by a flat level below a few gev , followed by a power - law with larger index up to a few tev .",
    "there is no apparent cut - off in the h.e.s.s . spectrum .",
    ".parameters for the fit .",
    "@xmath21 is the electron density ; @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the minimum , break and maximum electron lorentz factor , respectively ; @xmath25 is the electron spectral index below the break ; @xmath26 is the magnetic field strength ; @xmath27 is the bulk lorentz factor ; @xmath28 is the radius of the components ; @xmath29 is the observation angle ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the luminosity of the disk and the dusty torus , respectively ; @xmath32 is the observed jet length . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the data together with the modeling is presented in figure [ fig : sed ] .",
    "the respective parameter sets are given in table [ tab : inputcom ] .",
    "blazars are commonly described by a one - zone model , which in most cases gives successful fits to the sed .",
    "this model fails for ap librae .",
    "the most important constraint comes from the cut - off in the synchrotron component at uv energies and the fact that the swift - bat flux point is slightly above the @xmath1-ray flux level .",
    "the latter implies that the maximum of the ic component must be located between @xmath33kev and @xmath33mev .",
    "both constraints require a maximum electron lorentz factor @xmath34 . from below the electron distribution",
    "is constrained by the hard x - ray spectrum . attributing the x - ray core data to synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) emission requires a high minimum electron lorentz factor of @xmath35 , because the ssc spectrum is a pure power - law only below the photon energy associated with the minimum electron energy . above this energy",
    "the ssc spectrum is significantly curved due to the convolution of the broken electron distribution with the synchrotron spectrum and the complicated ic cross section .",
    "thus , the chandra and the swift - bat spectrum can not be fitted if the minimum lorentz factor is set below @xmath11 .. however , the issue of the narrow electron distribution is not circumvented . ]    in turn , the electron distribution function , which explains the synchrotron core component and the x - ray core data , is very narrow , and can not account for the vhe @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "the resulting model is presented with a thick dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] .",
    "the fit is good for most of the synchrotron component and fits the `` component 0 '' flux point of the mojave observations .",
    "the rest of the radio emission includes contributions from the milli - arcsecond jet .",
    "the model describing this data is not shown here for clarity , and can be found in @xcite .",
    "the flattening of the swift - uvot spectrum at higher uv energies suggest the addition of another component , which is usually attributed to the accretion disk .",
    "the accretion disk can illuminate the gas in close proximity of the black hole , which is interpreted here as a low - luminous torus .",
    "both components , whose parameters are given in table [ tab : inputcom ] , are also not shown for clarity .",
    "these two photon fields can serve as target photons for ic scattering by the blob electrons .",
    "the resulting flux contributes in the @xmath1-ray range , and can explain the flat flux level below a few gev .",
    "however , due to the low maximum electron lorentz factor , these emission processes can not explain the vhe emission , either .    in order to explain the vhe @xmath1-ray spectrum we consider the extended jet .",
    "it is modeled as the combination of a number of self - similar zones .",
    "the combined emission of all zones gives the total flux of the jet .",
    "the model of the kpc - scale jet is constrained by the vla and chandra data .",
    "since the flux in both radio and x - rays drops beyond the bend @xcite , we only consider the part closer than @xmath36arcsec from the core corresponding to a projected length of @xmath37kpc .",
    "the synchrotron and ic / cmb emission of the kpc - scale jet gives a good fit in the radio and the chandra energy range .",
    "interestingly , the extrapolation of the chandra jet spectrum intersects the fermi data roughly at the break at a few gev .",
    "this led us to the hypothesis that the vhe emission could originate in the kpc - scale jet .",
    "in fact , by choosing a maximum electron lorentz factor of @xmath38 in the kpc - jet , we successfully reproduce the vhe spectrum .",
    "as was shown in the previous section , the extended jet plays an important role in the radiative output of ap librae .",
    "it is responsible for a significant part of the sed .",
    "most importantly , the jet could be responsible for the vhe emission detected with the h.e.s.s .",
    "this is an unusual interpretation , since it implies highly relativistic flows and continuous reacceleration of the jet material on very large scales , given that modeling gives a deprojected length of ap librae s jet of @xmath39kpc .",
    "interestingly , in any observations of any scales the counter - jet has been detected . under the assumption that both jets are intrinsically identical , the counter - jet must be strongly de - beamed even at large distances from the galactic center .",
    "thus , we can conclude that even at large distances the jet must exhibit relativistic speeds without significant deceleration .",
    "the reacceleration of particles could be achieved by small - scale turbulence within the jet .",
    "shear - layer acceleration might also be a viable alternative , which could be acting on large scales @xcite .",
    "any of these possibilities would not disturb the observed homogeneity of the jet because they are of the size scale on the order of a supernova remnant and can not be resolved at the distance of ap librae .",
    "since the electrons emitting in the x - ray band are less energetic than the radio emitting electrons , the power in relativistic particles is high and in some jets exceeds the eddington luminosity even without accounting for cold protons .",
    "our modeling suggests that in ap librae the eddingtion luminosity constraint holds for the large - scale jet even if the dominating contribution of cold protons is included .",
    "below we present a few suggestions how this model could be tested .    due to the required highly relativistic electrons ( @xmath40 ) ,",
    "the jet should emit synchrotron emission up to the uv band .",
    "since the contribution of the galaxy in the uv band is much reduced compared to the optical and ir bands , the jet should be detectable despite its proximity to the bright core .",
    "if the jet is not detected in the uv with an upper limit below the predicted flux of our model curve , the ic / cmb is ruled out as the origin of the vhe emission , because the required electron energies can not be matched .    within the kpc - scale jet the relative flux decrease along the jet",
    "is expected to differ between the synchrotron and ic domains due to different beaming dependencies @xcite .",
    "the current observations do not allow to quantify this effect .",
    "more sensitive mapping at radio and x - ray frequencies could test this prediction .",
    "observations at he @xmath1-ray energies have been used to rule out the ic / cmb model in a number of extended x - ray jets @xcite , since the model overpredicts the upper limits derived from fermi observations . given that our model fits perfectly the he and vhe data of ap librae , this test is not applicable here .",
    "nevertheless , the he and vhe emission can be used to indirectly test the model .",
    "we do not expect variability in the extended jet emission , because such a large object requires to be steady over time scales much longer than a few times @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the flux above a few gev should not drop below the observed level .",
    "an increase in the flux at these energies during a flare might still originate from an additional flaring component and would not rule out the above model .",
    "however , such a component should also change the spectrum in the uv and potentially in the x - ray band .    given that ap librae s host is a bright elliptical galaxy , one can expect absorption of tev photons by the galactic optical starlight , if the tev photons originate from the central region .",
    "this effect is on the order of @xmath42 @xcite , and thus below the spectral sensitivities of the current generation of cherenkov experiments .",
    "however , the futur cherenkov telescope array might have the required sensitivity to detect the small absorption feature .",
    "this could be used to narrow down the location of tev emission region . in our jet model ,",
    "no absorption of tev emission within the host galaxy is expected .",
    "more observations in all energy bands are strongly encouraged .",
    "if confirmed , the emission of tev radiation by an extended , more than @xmath11kpc long jet would be a major result with strong implications for the transport and acceleration processes on large spatial scales .",
    "the authors wish to thank markus bttcher for the numerical code , which is described in detail in @xcite .",
