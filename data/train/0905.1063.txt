    "since the first demonstration of a laser - cooled atomic beam by phillips and metcalf @xcite the development and improvement of cold atom sources has evolved into an essential activity in atomic physics laboratories . in particular sources for cold rb , k and cs received a lot of attention and became compact and familiar standard devices @xcite .",
    "however , for most other atomic and all molecular species the situation is less favorable and considerable time as well as resources remain necessary for the development of a source . aside from optical cooling schemes many other cooling principles",
    "have been explored , we mention cryogenic cooling by surfaces @xcite or buffer gas @xcite , filtering by magnetic @xcite or electric funnels @xcite and stark deceleration of molecules @xcite as well as rydberg atoms @xcite . in spite of the success of these sources in specific cases ,",
    "optical cooling is the preferred option whenever an appropriate optical transition is available .",
    "the highest optically cooled atom fluxes to date have been produced from zeeman - slowed atomic beams @xcite .",
    "zeeman slowers have the additional advantage of a wide applicability .",
    "unfortunately , their use adds a substantial engineering effort to system design and construction , in particular if beam - brightening and recycling principles are involved @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field inside the zeeman slower must be very smooth and satisfy a particular profile in order to optimize the slowing .",
    "in addition , as the acceptance angle is small , the source oven has to be positioned on the beam axis and operated under high flux conditions . in typical applications",
    "this gives rise to a high background of hot atoms and results in maintenance because the oven has to be reloaded regularly .",
    "an important simplification of cold atom sources was realized when monroe _ _ et .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated that in a room - temperature vapor a fraction of the atoms can be optically captured and cooled into a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) and subsequently loaded into a magnetic trap .",
    "the primary drawback of this vapor - cell mot ( vcmot ) is that the lifetime of the magnetically trapped atoms is limited by collisions with hot atoms from the vapor , thus limiting the time available for experiment .",
    "one approach to overcome this limitation is pulsed loading , starting from an alkali getter dispenser @xcite or by ultraviolet light induced desorption @xcite .",
    "all other solutions involve a dual chamber arrangement in which a source chamber , containing some variation of the vcmot source , is separated by a differential pumping channel from an ultra - high - vacuum ( uhv ) chamber in which the atoms are recaptured in a secondary mot in preparation for experiments under uhv conditions .",
    "three basic types of vcmot sources are used in the dual mot configurations . in the first type a pulsed vcmot serves to load the recapture mot by a sequence of cold atom bunches , transferred with the aid of a push beam @xcite .",
    "the second type is known as the lvis ( low - velocity intense source ) @xcite . in this case",
    "the vcmot and the push beam are operated continuously , giving rise to a steady beam of cold atoms in the direction of the push beam . in the third type the standard three - dimensional ( 3d ) mot arrangement in the source chamber",
    "is replaced by a two - dimensional ( 2d ) mot configuration , with ( 2d@xmath13-mot ) or without ( 2d  mot ) push and cooling beams along the symmetry axis @xcite . this has the important advantage that the source mot can be optimized for capture because , with confinement in only two directions , the residence time and collisional losses are intrinsically low .",
    "vcmot sources work most conveniently for elements like cs , rb , and k , having a vapor pressure of @xmath14 mbar around room temperature @xcite .",
    "elements such as li , yb , cr and the alkaline earths must be loaded from atomic beams since their vapor pressures are only significant at temperatures far above the maximum baking temperature of a conventional uhv system @xcite . in the case of elements which are chemically reactive with glass , such as li , a vapor cell is additionally impractical .    in this paper",
    "we present a novel 2d  mot source for cold lithium .",
    "it yields a cold flux comparable to the maximum achieved with lithium zeeman slowers @xcite .",
    "contrary to previously realized 2d  mot systems our source is transversely loaded with a beam from an effusive oven , rather than longitudinally like in beam brighteners or isotropically like in vapor cells .",
    "this demonstrates the possibility to use 2d  mot sources in applications where a vapor cell can not be used and avoids the background of hot atoms in the beam .",
    "an important _ a priory _ uncertainty of this arrangement is the risk of depletion of the low - velocity tail of capturable atoms by the onset of nozzling as occurred in the famous zacharias fountain experiment @xcite .",
    "our work shows that large cold atomic fluxes can be realized without this depletion becoming inhibitive .",
    "recently this was also demonstrated with a li oven loaded 3d  mot @xcite .",
    "another novelty of our source is the application of the 2d  mot concept to a light atom like lithium .",
    "magneto - optical trapping of light species requires a high gradient for efficient capture . as this also compresses the cold atoms into a cloud of small volume ,",
    "in particular in the 3d configuration trap losses are substantial even for small atom numbers .",
    "we demonstrate that in our dual mot arrangement , the 2d  mot can be optimized for capture with a large gradient and without considerable losses , whereas the 3d recapture mot can be optimized with a different gradient for maximum total atom number .    in the following sections we describe our experimental apparatus ( section [ section : experimental ] ) and our results ( section [ section : experimentalresults ] ) . in section",
    "[ section : sourcemodel ] we present a simple model for the loading of the 2d mot .",
    "the performance of our system and loss mechanisms are discussed in section [ section : discussion ] and in section [ section : conclusion ] we summarize our findings and comment on the suitability of our approach for other atomic species .",
    "the experimental setup of the lithium 2d  mot source is sketched in fig.[fig : vacuum ] .",
    "the vacuum system consists of a stainless steel six - way cross of @xmath15 tubing of which two cf40 ports define the horizontal symmetry axis of the source .",
    "the other four cf40 ports are configured under @xmath16 and sealed with standard vacuum windows providing the optical access for the retroreflected 2d  mot beams with a waist ( @xmath17 radius ) @xmath18 .",
    "a lithium oven is mounted with a cf16 flange onto the bottom of a water - cooled tube with inner radius @xmath19 and connected along the vertical axis into the center of the cross .",
    "the source is connected horizontally onto the main uhv chamber , separated by a gate valve . between the main vacuum and the source",
    "a @xmath20 long differential pumping ( dp ) channel of @xmath21 diameter can maintain a maximum pressure ratio of @xmath22 between the main uhv chamber and the source .",
    "there is no direct line of sight from the oven to the main uhv chamber nor to the windows .",
    "when the oven is operated and the 2d  mot lasers are off , no lithium was detected in the main uhv chamber . also no measurable gas load is observed on the main vacuum while the source is operated .",
    "[ ptb ]    libeamsource.eps      the oven consists of a stainless steel lithium reservoir , @xmath23 high and @xmath24 in diameter , attached to a cf16 flange by a @xmath25 long tube of @xmath26 inner diameter .",
    "the oven is embedded in a simple heat shield of glass wool and aluminium foil and is connected to the vacuum system using a nickel gasket .",
    "the reservoir was loaded with @xmath27 g of @xmath28li and @xmath29 g of @xmath30li under an inert gas ( argon ) atmosphere . as commercial lithium contains a large fraction of lih it has to be degassed by dissociating the hydride . for this purpose",
    "we baked the oven under vacuum in a separate setup for two hours at a temperature of @xmath31 .",
    "some @xmath32 of the lithium was lost in this process . to protect the employed turbopump from alkali contamination",
    "a liquid nitrogen cold trap was used in this procedure .    under typical conditions",
    "the oven is operated at @xmath33 ( @xmath34 c ) , well above the melting point of lithium at @xmath35 .",
    "all data presented in this paper , except those presented in fig.[fig : loadingvstemp ] , were obtained at this temperature .",
    "the oven temperature is calibrated by doppler thermometry of the emerging li flux using a probe beam under @xmath36 with the vertical axis ( see fig.[fig : vacuum ] ) .",
    "temperature stabilization is done with a thermocouple reference .",
    "starting from room temperature the oven reaches the regulated value of @xmath37 in @xmath38 minutes .",
    "the @xmath28li abundance was measured to be @xmath39 using absorption spectroscopy on the @xmath28li @xmath40 @xmath41 line and the @xmath30li @xmath42 @xmath43 line .      as sketched in fig.[fig : vacuum ] the 2d  mot consists of a 2d quadrupole magnetic field in combination with two orthogonal pairs of retroreflected laser beams of opposite circular polarization , at a power of up to @xmath44 mw per beam in a waist of @xmath45 and red - detuned with respect to the optical resonance near @xmath46 . like in a standard 3d  mot @xcite , a cold atom moving in the crossed laser field is optically pumped to a state for which the zeeman shift places it closer to resonance with a laser opposing the motion of the atom .",
    "thus the atoms are trapped and cooled in the radial direction and collect along the symmetry axis of the 2d quadrupole field but are free to move in the axial direction . as a result only atoms with a sufficiently low axial velocity can be radially trapped ; atoms with a residence time of less then @xmath47  ms in the optical trapping region leave the 2d  mot before they are significantly cooled .",
    "only the radially cooled atoms give rise to a sufficiently collimated beam to pass through the dp - channel and be recaptured by a 3d mot in the middle of the uhv chamber .    for best performance",
    "the atoms are accelerated out of the source by a push beam , aligned along the symmetry axis and with a waist of @xmath48  mm passing through the dp - channel .",
    "the detuning and intensity of the push laser determine the velocity of the atoms emerging from the source .",
    "this velocity is chosen below the capture limit of the recapture mot but is sufficiently fast to assure that the atoms do not fall below the recapture region as a result of gravity .",
    "for this reason the push beam is essential for horizontal configurations but optional in vertical arrangements . in all arrangements",
    "the push beam acceleration increases the output flux because it reduces the residence time in the 2d  mot and therefore background - induced losses . in the literature on the 2d@xmath13 mot @xcite and the lvis @xcite control over the axial velocity",
    "is reported by using a pair of counter - propagating axial cooling beams over the entire trap but this method is not employed here .",
    "the magnetic quadrupole field is provided by two sets of nd@xmath49fe@xmath50b magnets ( eclipse magnets n750-rb ) with a measured magnetization of @xmath51 .",
    "each set consists of two stacks of three @xmath52 magnet bars separated by @xmath53 to make an effective dipole bar of @xmath54 total length .",

    "we calculate a field gradient of @xmath56 , constant within @xmath57 along the 2d  mot symmetry axis over a total length of @xmath58 .",
    "the use of permanent magnets simplifies the application of the high field gradients needed for light species .",
    "it combines a simple construction with convenient alignment and occupies much less space than the more traditional racetrack coils .",
    "the quadrupole field falls off over short distances along the symmetry axis . at the position of the recapture mot ,",

    "hence , there is no closed transition suitable for cooling and trapping and strong optical pumping to the @xmath67 level can not be avoided . as a consequence the ` trapping ' and ` repumping ' beams have to be of comparable intensities , which means that both beams contribute to the cooling and mutually serve for repumping .",
    "also the detunings will have a strong influence in this respect @xcite . in spite of these differences",
    "we stick to the conventional terminology , referring to the transition @xmath68 as the ` trapping ' transition and to @xmath69 as the ` repumping ' transition .      a laser system for wavelength @xmath70 was developed to serve the 2d ( source ) mot and the 3d ( recapture ) mot as well as to provide laser beams for @xmath28li diagnostics .",

    "of these six beams four are amplified by injection - locking of the slave lasers and of these four beams one pair is used for the retroreflected trapping and repumping beams of the 2d  mot while the other pair is equally distributed over six beams and similarly employed for the 3d  mot .",
