    "simulations suggest strongly that the walks do not collide if @xmath30 , and , somewhat less strongly , even for @xmath31 .",
    "the present paper proves the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : main ] if @xmath28 is sufficiently large then on the graph @xmath27 , the independent random walks @xmath24 , @xmath25 are compatible with positive probability .",
    "the upper bound computable for @xmath28 from the proof is very bad . in what follows we will also use the simpler notation @xmath32 the problem , called the clairvoyant demon problem , arose first in distributed computing .",
    "the original problem was to find a leader among a finite number of processes that form the nodes of a communication graph .",
    "there is a proposed algorithm : at start , let each process have a `` token '' .",
    "the processes pass the tokens around in such a way that each token performs a random walk .",
    "however , when two tokens collide they merge",
    ". eventually , only one token will remain and whichever process has it becomes the leader .",
    "the paper  @xcite examined the algorithm in the traditional setting of distributed computing , when the timing of this procedure is controlled by an adversary .",
    "under the ( reasonable ) assumption that the adversary does not see the future sequence of moves to be made by the tokens , the work  @xcite gave a very good upper bound on the expected time by which a leader will be found .",
    "it considered then the question whether a clairvoyant adversary ( a `` demon '' who sees far ahead into the future token moves ) can , by controlling the timing alone , with positive probability , prevent two distinct tokens from ever colliding .",
    "the present paper solves conjecture 3 of  @xcite , which says that this is the case when the communication graph is a large complete graph .",
    "the proof is long and complex , but its construction is based some simple principles presented below in section  [ sec : outline ] , after first transforming the problem into a percolation problem in section  [ subsec : perc ] . the rest of the paper is devoted mainly to proving lemma  [ lem : main ] , stated at the end of section  [ sec : outline ] .",

    "2 .   let us call these closed sites _ _ .",
    "these have long - range dependencies , making it hard to handle them directly : therefore for `` bad events '' ( like when too many obstacles crowd together ) , we introduce a hierarchy of new kinds of obstacles in section  [ sec : mazery ] .",

    "_ , like the original example , and infinite horizontal or vertical _ _ of various widths .",
    "a wall can only be penetrated at certain places .",
    "traps at the higher levels of the hierarchy are larger , walls are wider and denser .",
    "but these higher - level objects have smaller probability of occurrence , therefore on level @xmath35 it will be possible to assume the local absence of level @xmath36 objects with high probability . that percolation is possible under this assumption for each @xmath35 , is proved in section  [ sec : approx - proof ] .",
    "4 .   the structure of random traps , walls , and so on , whose versions appear on all levels , is defined in section  [ sec : mazery ] .",
    "the higher - level objects are defined by a recursive procedure in section  [ subsec : plan.constr ] , though some parameters will only be fixed in section  [ sec : params ] .",
    "their combinatorial properties are proved in section  [ subsec : plan.prop ] .",
    "those probabilistic estimates for the higher - level objects that can be proved without fixing all parameters are given in sections  [ sec : bounds ] .",

    "we say that the sequences @xmath6 are _ _ if there is a pair of delay sequences @xmath7 without collisions . it is easy to see that this is equivalent to saying that 0 s can be deleted from both sequences in such a way that the resulting sequences have no collisions in the sense that they never have a 1 in the same position .",
    "suppose that for @xmath8 , @xmath41 are two independent infinite sequences of independent random variables where @xmath42 with probability @xmath43 and 0 with probability @xmath44 .",
    "our question is : are @xmath24 and @xmath25 compatible with positive probability ? the question depends , of course , on the value of @xmath43 : intuitively , it seems that they are compatible if @xmath43 is small .",
    "peter winkler and harry kesten  @xcite , independently of each other , found an upper bound smaller than 1/2 on the values @xmath43 for which @xmath45 are compatible .",

    "the author recommends the reader to refer to paper  @xcite while reading the present one .",
    "its technique prefigures the one used here : the main architecture is similar , but many details are simpler .",

    "let us `` color '' the @xmath51th vertical line by the state @xmath52 , and the @xmath53th horizontal line by the state @xmath54 .",

    ", the paper  @xcite shows that the directed problem has a different nature , since it has power - law convergence ( the undirected percolations have the usual exponential convergence ) .",
    "the proof introduces a whole army of auxiliary concepts , which are cumbersome to keep track of",
    ". the reader will find it helpful occasionally to refer to the glossary and notation index provided at the end of the paper .",

    "an example of the ordinary renormalization method would be when , say , in an ising model , the space is partitioned into blocks , spins in each block are summed into a sort of `` superspin '' , and it is shown that the system of super - spins exhibits a behavior that is in some sense similar to the original system .",
    "we will also map our model repeatedly into a series of higher - order models similar to each other .",
    "however the definition of the new models is more complex than just taking the sums of some quantity over blocks .",
    "the model which will scale up properly may contain a number of new objects , and restrictions more combinatorial than computational in character .",

    "the role of the `` bad events '' of subsection  [ subsec : renorm ] will be played by _ _ and _ _ .",
    "the simplest kind of trap is a point @xmath55 in the plane such that @xmath78 ; in other words , a closed point .",
    "more generally , traps will be certain rectangles in the plane .",
    "we want to view the occurrence of two traps close to each other as a very bad event ; however , this is justified only if this is indeed very improbable .",
    "consider the events @xmath79 ( for simplicity , this example assumes that the random walk has the option of staying at the same point , that is loops have been added to the graph @xmath80 . ) the event @xmath81 makes the rectangle @xmath82}\\times \\{5\\}$ ] a trap of size 3 , and has probability @xmath83 .",

    "however , these two events are not independent : the probability of @xmath85 is only @xmath86 , not @xmath87 .",
    "the reason is that the event @xmath88 significantly increases the conditional probability that , say , the rectangle @xmath82}\\times \\{5\\}$ ] becomes a trap .",

    "our proof systematizes the above ideas by introducing an abstract notion of traps , walls and holes .",
    "we will have walls of many different types .",
    "to each ( say , vertical ) wall of a given type , the probability that a ( horizontal ) hole goes through it at a given point will be much higher than the probability that a ( horizontal ) wall of this type occurred at that point .",
    "thus , the `` luck '' needed to go through some wall type is still smaller than the `` bad luck '' needed to create a wall of this type .",

    "an informal effort to try to prove lemma  [ lem : approx ] ( approximation ) should give some insight : in other words , the reader should try to convince herself that as long as the kind of `` very bad events '' covered by the emerging traps and walls do not occur , percolation can occur",
