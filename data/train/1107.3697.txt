    "the transition to turbulence in shear flows has been the subject of study since reynolds pioneering studies over a century ago  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in understanding shear - flow transition is largely attributable to the subcritical nature of the problem . in all of the classic cases  pipe flow , channel flow , plane couette flow , boundary layer flow and others ",
    "turbulence is found at reynolds numbers for which laminar flow is linearly stable . in such flows turbulence",
    "appears abruptly following finite - sized disturbances of laminar flow and not through a sequence of instabilities each increasing the dynamical complexity of the flow .",
    "this limits the applicability of linear and weakly nonlinear theories in addressing transition in these cases .",
    "one of the most intriguing aspects of shear turbulence is the intermittent form it takes in the transitional regime , near the minimum reynolds number for which turbulence can be triggered . in pipe flow , one observes localized turbulent patches , known as puffs , surrounded upstream and downstream by laminar flow  @xcite . in planar cases , such as plane couette flow and boundary layer flow ,",
    "one commonly observes turbulent spots surrounded by laminar flow @xcite .",
    "even more intriguing is the regular alternation of turbulent and laminar regions that is now known to arise spontaneously in many shear flows with sufficiently large aspect ratio  @xcite .",
    "minimal models of spatiotemporal intermittency have been useful in understanding generic features of intermittent shear turbulence  @xcite .",
    "here , i consider models that contain more of the physics specific to shear turbulence and from this i obtain models that produce quite realistic dynamics . for pipe flow",
    "it is possible to reproduce nearly all of the large - scale phenomena associated with transition using only two scalar equations .",
    "other shear flows are more difficult , but i point to some ideas for plane couette flow .",
    "in this section i consider pipe flow . as concerns the large - scale features , pipe flow is effectively a one - dimensional system and this makes it a particularly good problem to tackle first .",
    "i will summarize basic features of pipe flow and recall the modeling proposed in @xcite .",
    "then i will consider an alternative approach to that in @xcite and here model turbulence by multiplicative noise .",

    "the reynolds numbers is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is kinematic viscosity .",
    "flows are well represented by two quantities , the turbulence intensity @xmath4 and the axial ( streamwise ) velocity @xmath5 , sampled on the pipe axis . specifically , @xmath4 is the magnitude of transverse fluid velocity ( scaled up by a factor of 6 ) .",
    "the centerline velocity @xmath5 is relative to the mean velocity and is a proxy for the state of the mean shear that conveniently lies between 0 and 1 . at low @xmath6 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : dns](a ) , turbulence occurs in localized patches propagating downstream with nearly constant shape and speed .",
    "these are called equilibrium puffs  @xcite , a misnomer since at low @xmath6 puffs are only metastable and eventually revert to laminar flow , i.e.decay  @xcite .",
    "asymptotically the flow will be laminar parabolic flow , @xmath7 , throughout the pipe . for intermediate @xmath6 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : dns](b ) , puff splitting frequently occurs  @xcite .",

    "further splittings will occur and interactions will lead asymptotically to a highly intermittent mixture of turbulent and laminar flow  @xcite . at",

    "[ fig : dns ] ) edge of turbulent patches , laminar flow abruptly becomes turbulent .",
    "energy from the laminar shear is rapidly converted into turbulent motion and this results in a rapid change to the mean shear profile  @xcite . in the case of puffs ,",
    "the turbulent profile is not able to sustain turbulence and thus there is a reverse transition  @xcite from turbulent to laminar flow on the downstream side of a puff . in the case of slugs",
    ", the turbulent shear profile can sustain turbulence indefinitely ; there is no reverse transition and slugs grow to arbitrary streamwise length  @xcite . on the downstream side of turbulent patches the mean shear profile recovers slowly  @xcite , seen in the behavior of @xmath5 in fig .",
    "1 . the degree of recovery dictates how susceptible the flow is to re - excitation into turbulence  @xcite .",
    "the following partial - differential equation ( pde ) model captures the essence of these physical features : @xmath13 in the model , the parameter @xmath14 plays the role of reynolds number @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath15 accounts for downstream advection by the mean velocity , and is otherwise dynamically irrelevant since it can be removed by a change of reference frame .",
    "the model includes minimum derivatives , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , needed for turbulent regions to excite adjacent laminar ones and for left - right symmetry breaking .",
    "the core of the model is seen in the @xmath4-@xmath5 phase plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : pde ] .",
    "the trajectories are organized by the nullclines : curve where @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the local dynamics ( @xmath20 ) . for all @xmath14 the nullclines intersect in a stable , but excitable , fixed point corresponding to laminar parabolic flow .",
    "the @xmath5 dynamics with @xmath21 captures in the simplest way the behavior of the mean shear . in the absence of turbulence ( @xmath22 )",
    ", @xmath5 relaxes to @xmath23 at rate @xmath24 , while in response to turbulence ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath5 decreases at a faster rate dominated by @xmath26 .",
    "values @xmath27 and @xmath28 give reasonable agreement with pipe flow .",
    "the @xmath4-nullcline consists of @xmath22 ( turbulence is not spontaneously generated from laminar flow ) together with a parabolic curve whose nose varies with @xmath14 , while maintaining a fixed intersection with @xmath22 at @xmath29 , ( @xmath30 is used here ) .",
    "the upper branch is attractive , while the lower branch is repelling and sets the nonlinear stability threshold for laminar flow .",
    "if laminar flow is perturbed beyond the threshold ( which decreases with @xmath14 like @xmath31 ) , @xmath4 is nonlinearly amplified and @xmath5 decreases in response .",
    "the ( excitable ) puff regime occurs for @xmath32 , figs .",
    "[ fig : pde](a ) and ( c ) .",
    "the upstream side of a puff is a trigger front  @xcite where abrupt laminar to turbulent transition takes place .",
    "however , turbulence can not be maintained locally following the drop in the mean shear .",
    "the system relaminarizes ( reverse transition ) on the downstream side in a phase front  @xcite whose speed is set by the upstream front .",
    "following relaminarization , @xmath5 relaxes and laminar flow regains susceptibility to turbulent perturbations .",
    "the slug regime occurs for @xmath33 , figs .",
    "[ fig : pde](b ) and ( d ) . the nullclines intersect in additional fixed points .",
    "the system is bistable and turbulence can be maintained indefinitely in the presence of modified shear .",
    "both the upstream and downstream sides are trigger fronts , moving at different speeds , giving rise to an expansion of turbulence .",
    "while the pde model captures the essence of the puff - slug transition , the model of turbulence is too simple to capture features such as puff decay and puff splitting . in @xcite ,",
    "a more realistic model was obtained by employing a tent map to mimic shear turbulence .",
    "the map was designed to give a local phase - space structure similar to the nullcline picture for the pde seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pde ] , with the exception that the upper turbulent branch is instead a region of transient chaos .",
    "this approach was motivated by the view that shear turbulence is locally a chaotic saddle  @xcite and it naturally extends previous ideas of modeling chaotic transients with maps @xcite .",
    "the resulting model has the advantage of being deterministic , as is fluid flow , at least at the level of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "here i consider an alternative approach and model turbulence as noise .",
    "this is at the other extreme from the low - dimensional map . here",
    "the dynamics is infinite dimensional and not deterministic .",
    "the simplest approach is to apply noise to the @xmath4 equation and assume it is proportional to @xmath4 itself .",
    "this leads to the following stochastic pde ( spde ) model : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is gaussian noise .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 controls the noise strength . in reality , shear turbulence has significant correlations on the scale of a puff , but these correlations are not considered here and @xmath37 taken here to be space - time white .",
    "a large advantage of modeling the effect of turbulence through a noise term is that one has a direct connection to the simple pde model .",
    "moreover , analysis of the spde is likely to be easier than analysis of the deterministic map model .",
    "the price is the loss of deterministic dynamics .",
    "figures  [ fig : model ] and [ fig : spacetime ] show the regimes of transitional pipe flow from simulations of eqs .  - .",

    "puffs , puff splitting , and slugs are found very similar to those observed in full dns ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dns ] ) and in the deterministic map model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the dynamics of the different regimes is seen in the space - time plots of fig .",

    "puffs are metastable .",
    "they persist for long times before abruptly decaying . for intermediate @xmath14 ,",
    "puff splitting occurs .",
    "new puffs are spontaneously nucleated downstream of existing puffs and the system evolves to an intermittent mixture of turbulent and laminar phases . at larger @xmath14 ,",
    "slugs are observed which differ from the deterministic pde mainly in that they first occur at larger @xmath14 and the upper branch is noisy rather than constant .",

    "while all three regions shown in figs .  [ fig : model ] and [ fig : spacetime ] strongly resemble their counterparts in full dns and experiment , the splitting regime is particularly significant and worthy of further comment . unlike for puffs and slugs , which are essentially contained in the model by construction , splitting",
    "is seen to arise naturally from the elementary puff - slug transition in the presence of complex turbulent dynamics ( either noise as here or chaotic dynamics as in @xcite ) . the space - time plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : spacetime](b ) could easily be mistaken for the corresponding plot from full dns ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "sufficient turbulence occasionally escapes from the irregular downstream side of a puff to nucleate a new puff downstream .",
    "visually , this is just as in real pipe flow and is a strong qualitative validation of this modeling approach .",
    "one of the main difficulties in extending these ideas to other shear flows , such as channel flow or plane couette flow , is the complexity of the mean flow in these cases  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear at the present time whether one can adequately model the mean shear in these flows using simple scalar fields .",
    "nevertheless , i discuss here some preliminary ideas on how plane couette flow might be approached within this modeling framework .",
    "figure  [ fig : sketch ] shows a sketch for plane couette flow . a turbulent patch ( red )",
    "is shown surrounded to the left and right by laminar flow .",
    "one can view this as a cut through a single turbulent band in the striped regime or through a localized patch of turbulence  @xcite .",

    "recall that the geometry of plane couette flow has translation symmetry in the streamwise direction @xmath12 and also centro - symmetry ( rotation by @xmath45 ) about any point on the midplane @xmath46 .",
    "taking the point to be at @xmath47 , the centro - symmetry is the transformation @xmath48 .",
    "time averaged turbulent - laminar patterns break translational symmetry , but do not break centro - symmetry @xcite .",
    "the idea is to model intermittent turbulence in plane couette flow as two layers , each described by one - dimensional equations similar to those for pipe flow .",
    "the turbulence in the two layers is assumed to be coupled .",
    "taking into account that the mean advection in the bottom layer is opposite to that in the top layer , i propose the following pde model @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the turbulence and mean shear in the upper layer and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the turbulence and mean shear in the lower layer .",
