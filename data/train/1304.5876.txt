    "given an undirected graph @xmath0 with vertex set @xmath1 and edge set @xmath2 , a k - coloring of @xmath3 is a function @xmath4 that assigns to each vertex @xmath5 a color @xmath6 , where @xmath7 . a k - coloring is considered legal if each pair of vertices @xmath8 connected by an edge @xmath9 receive different colors @xmath10 . the minimum sum coloring problem ( mscp ) is to find a legal k - coloring @xmath11 such that the total sum of colors over all the vertices @xmath12 is minimized .",
    "the minimum value of this sum is called the chromatic sum of @xmath3 and denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "the number of colors related to the chromatic sum is called the strength of the graph and denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the mscp is np - hard for general graphs @xcite and provides applications mainly including vlsi design , scheduling and resource allocation @xcite .",
    "given the theoretical and practical significance of the mscp , effective approximation algorithms and polynomial algorithms have been presented for some special cases of graphs , such as trees , interval graphs and bipartite graphs @xcite . for the purpose of practical solving of the general mscp ,",
    "a variety of heuristics have been proposed in recent years , comprising a parallel genetic algorithm @xcite , a greedy algorithm @xcite , a tabu search algorithm @xcite , a hybrid local search algorithm @xcite , an independent set extraction based algorithm @xcite and a local search algorithm @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "binary quadratic programming ( bqp ) has emerged during the past decade as a unified model for a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems , such as set packing @xcite , set partitioning @xcite , generalized independent set @xcite , maximum edge weight clique @xcite and maxcut @xcite . a review concerning the additional applications and the reformulation procedures can be found in @xcite .",
    "this bqp approach has the advantage of directly applying an algorithm designed for bqp to solve other classes of problems rather than resorting to a specialized solution method .",
    "moreover , this approach proves to be competitive or even better than the special algorithms proposed for several problems .    in this paper , we investigate for the first time the application of this bqp approach to solve the mscp problem .",
    "we propose a binary quadratic formulation for the mscp which is solved by our path relinking algorithm previously designed for the general bqp . to assess the performance of the proposed approach , we present computational results on a set of 23 benchmark instances from the literature and contrast these results with those of several reference algorithms specifically dedicated to the mscp .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec_trans ] illustrates how to transform the mscp into the bqp formulation .",
    "section [ sec_pra ] presents an overview of our path relinking algorithm for the general bqp .",
    "section [ sec_results ] is dedicated to computational results and comparisons with other reference algorithms in the literature .",
    "the paper is concluded in section [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "given an undirected graph @xmath0 with vertex set @xmath1 ( @xmath15 ) and edge set @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath16 be 1 if vertex @xmath17 is assigned color @xmath18 , and 0 otherwise .",
    "the linear programming model for the mscp can be formulated as follows : @xmath19      the linear model of the mscp can be recast into the form of the bqp according to the following steps :    for the constraints @xmath20 , we represent these linear equations by a matrix @xmath21 and incorporate the following penalty transformation @xcite : @xmath22 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\\\ & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ = p[x^{t}(a^{t}a)x - x^{t}(a^{t}b)-(b^{t}a)x]+pb^{t}b \\\\ & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ = xd_{1}x+c \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] for the constraints @xmath23 , we utilize the quadratic penalty function @xmath24 to replace each inequality @xmath25 in @xmath23 and add them up as follows @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 if @xmath28 and 0 otherwise .    to construct the nonlinear bqp formulation @xmath29 , we first inverse the minimum objective of the mscp to be @xmath30 in accordance with the general bqp model under a maximum objective , which becomes the first component of @xmath29",
    ". then we add the penalty function @xmath31 into @xmath29 such that @xmath32 if all the linear equations in @xmath20 are satisfied and otherwise @xmath31 is a penalty term with large negative values .",
    "in the same way , we add the penalty function @xmath33 into @xmath29 .",
    "hence , the resulting bqp formulation for the mscp can be expressed as follows :    @xmath34    once the optimal objective value for this bqp formulation is obtained , the minimum sum coloring value can be readily obtained by taking its inverse value .",
    "further , a penalty scalar @xmath35 is considered to be suitable as long as its absolute value @xmath36 is larger than half of the maximum color ( @xmath37 ) . consider that penalty functions should be negative under the case of a maximal objective , we select @xmath38 for the benchmark instances experimented in this paper . the optimized solution @xmath39 obtained by solving the nonlinear bqp formulation indicates that such selection ensures both @xmath31 and @xmath33 equal to 0 .",
    "in other words , each variable @xmath16 with the assignment of 1 in the optimized solution @xmath39 forms a feasible k - coloring in which vertex @xmath17 gets the color @xmath18 .      to illustrate the transformation from the mscp to the bqp formulation , we consider the following graph with @xmath40 and expect to find a legal @xmath41-coloring with @xmath42 .",
    "+    its linear formulation according to equation ( [ lp ] ) is : @xmath43 choosing the scalar penalty @xmath44 , we obtain the following bqp model : @xmath45    where @xmath46 is written as :    @xmath47    solving this bqp model yields @xmath48 ( all other variables equal zero ) and the optimal objective function value @xmath49 .",
    "reversing this objective function value leads to the optimum ( the minimum sum coloring ) of 6 for this graph .",
    "path relinking @xcite is a general search strategy closely associated with tabu search and its underlying ideas share a significant intersection with the tabu search perspective @xcite , with applications in a variety of contexts where it has proved to be very effective in solving difficult problems .",
    "our previous path relinking algorithm ( pr ) is directly utilized to solve the mscp in its nonlinear bqp form as expressed in eq .",
    "the proposed path relinking algorithm is mainly composed of the following components : _ refset initialization _ , _ solution improvement _ , _ relinking _ , _ solution selection _ , _ refset updating _ and _ refset rebuilding_. below we overview the general scheme of our path relinking algorithm .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "firstly , the _ refset initialization",
    "_ method is used to create an initial set of elite solutions _ refset _ where each solution is obtained by applying a tabu search procedure to a randomly generated solution .",
    "secondly , for each pair of solutions ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) in _ refset _ we undertake the following operations : ( 1 ) apply a _ relinking _ method to generate two paths ( from @xmath50 to @xmath51 and from @xmath51 to @xmath50 ) by exploring trajectories ( strictly confined to the neighborhood space ) that connect high - quality solutions .",
    "the first and last solutions of the path are respectively called the initiating and guiding solutions . at each step of building the path from the initiating solution to the guiding solution , we randomly select a variable from the set of variables for which @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) have different values ; ( 2 ) apply a _ solution selection _ method to select one solution from those generated on the path by reference both to its quality and to the hamming distance of this solution to the initiating solution and the guiding solution . this selected solution is then submitted to the tabu search based _ improvement method _ ; ( 3 ) apply a _ refset updating _ method to decide if the newly improved solution is inserted in _",
    "refset _ to replace the worst solution .",
    "the above procedure is called a round of our path relinking procedure .    finally , once a round of path relinking procedure is completed , a _ refset rebuilding",
    "_ method is launched to rebuild _ refset _ that is used by the next round of the path relinking procedure .",
    "the path relinking algorithm terminates as soon as its stop condition ( e.g. a fixed computing time ) is satisfied .",
    "to assess this bqp approach for the mscp , we carry out experiments on a set of 23 graphs , which are the most used benchmark instances in the literature .",
    "our experiments are conducted on a pc with pentium 2.83ghz cpu and 8 gb ram . the time limit for a single run of our path relinking algorithm",
    "is set as follows : 1 hour for the first 16 instances in table [ table_results ] ; 10 hours for dsjc125.1 , dsjc125.5 , dsjc125.9 , dsjc250.1 and dsjc250.5 ; 20 hours for dsjc250.9 and dsjc500.1 .",
    "given the stochastic nature of our pr algorithm , each problem instance is independently solved 20 times .",
    "the tabu tenure @xmath52 and the improvement cutoff @xmath53 @xcite are two parameters in the tabu search based improvement method  a key component of the pr algorithm . according to preliminary experiments , we set @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 denotes the number of variables in the resulting bqp model and rand(50 ) receives a random integer ranging from 1 to 50 ) .",
    "in addition , we set @xmath56 for the improvement of the initial solutions in @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the improvement of the solutions on the path , respectively .",
    "table [ table_results ] presents the computational statistics of the bqp model for the mscp .",
    "columns 1 to 3 give the instance names _ instances _ along with the vertex number @xmath1 and edge number @xmath2 of the graphs . columns 4 and 5 show the number of colors @xmath41 to be used and the number of variables @xmath55 in the bqp formulation .",
    "column 6 summarizes the best known results _",
    "bkr _ from the previous literature @xcite .",
    "the columns under the heading of bqp - pr report our results of the bqp model solved by the pr algorithm : the best objective values @xmath59 , the average objective values @xmath60 , the standard deviation @xmath61 , the average time @xmath62 ( in seconds ) to reach the best objective value @xmath59 over 20 runs , and the average time ( in seconds ) @xmath63 consumed to reach the best objective value obtained in each run .",
    "the last row shows the average performance over a total of 23 tested instances in terms of the deviations of the best and average solution values from the _",
    "bkr_. notice that the results marked in bold in the @xmath59 column indicate that bqp - pr reaches the _ bkr _ on these instances .",
    "we also applied cplex v12.2 to the linear model ( [ lp ] ) ( section [ linear model for the mscp ] ) to solve these mscp instances .",
    "cplex was successful in finding an optimal solution for 15 instances ( marked with an asterisk ) , but terminated abnormally for the remaining 8 instances due to excess requirements of memory .",
    ".computational statistics of the bqp - pr approach for the mscp [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     as we can observe in table [ table_cmp ] , the proposed bqp - pr approach outperforms hls , mrlf , pga and ts in terms of the best solution values .",
    "specifically , bqp - pr finds better solutions than hls , mrlf , pga and ts for 3 , 14 , 8 and 7 instances , respectively .",
    "finally , bqp - pr performs less well compared with the most effective mscp heuristics exscol and mds(5 ) . from this experiment",
    ", we conclude that our bqp approach combined with the pr algorithm for tacking the mscp constitutes an interesting alternative to specific algorithms tailored to this problem .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss some limitations of the proposed bqp - pr approach for solving the mscp .",
    "first , the proposed method may require considerable computing time to reach its best solutions for large graph instances ( see column @xmath63 in table [ table_results ] ) .",
    "this can be partially explained by the fact that the number of the bqp variables ( equaling @xmath64 where @xmath1 is the number of vertices and @xmath41 is the number of colors ) sharply increases with the growth of @xmath1 and @xmath41 .",
    "additionally , at present our approach is not able to solve graph instances with bqp variables surpassing the threshold value of 20,000 because of the memory limitation .",
    "these obstacles could be overcome by designing more effective data structures used by the bqp algorithms .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of solving the np - hard minimum sum coloring problem ( mscp ) via binary quadratic programming ( bqp ) .",
    "we have shown how the mscp can be recast into the bqp model and explained the key ideas of the path - relinking algorithm designed for the general bqp .",
    "experiments on a set of benchmark instances demonstrate that this general bqp approach is able to reach competitive solutions compared with several special purpose mscp algorithms even though considerable computing time may be required .",
    "the work is partially supported by the  pays de la loire \" region ( france ) within the radapop ( 2009 - 2013 ) and ligero ( 2010 - 2013 ) projects ."
