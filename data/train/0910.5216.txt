    "capillary filling , the ability of water to fill a hydrophilic channel , has been recognised since the pioneering work of lucas and washburn @xcite nearly a century ago .",
    "however , investigations of capillary filling in microchannels remain interesting due to modern applications of microfluid devices .",
    "advances in lithographic techniques mean that it is becoming increasingly feasible to fabricate microchannels with well defined surface structures on micron length scales .",
    "these have potential applications for chemical detection @xcite , as microreactors @xcite , or to build entropic traps for dna separation @xcite .",
    "our aim in this paper is to present a numerical investigation of how posts on the surface of a microchannel affect capillary filling .",
    "our results are relevant to the use of electrowetting to control flow in microchannels and suggest ways to overcome the difficulties of filling structured microchannels .    if a channel with hydrophilic walls comes into contact with a fluid reservoir it starts to fill as capillary forces pull the fluid into the channel .",
    "balancing the capillary forces ( @xmath1 ) against the viscous drag of the entering fluid ( @xmath2 ) gives an expression for the position of the advancing fluid in the channel @xmath3 as a function of time @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 for a capillary of height @xmath6 and infinite width .",
    "@xmath7 is the gas - liquid surface tension , @xmath8 the fluid viscosity and @xmath9 the contact angle of the advancing front .",
    "this formula neglects inertial and gravitational effects ( good approximations once filling is established , and for channels of dimension smaller than the capillary length ) , assumes that the displaced fluid has zero viscosity , and neglects the slip length .",
    "these conditions are not always satisfied by simplified models used to investigation of capillary filling .",
    "however , excellent agreement between the theory and numerical results can be achieved by accounting for drag forces of the gas ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the length of the channel and @xmath12 the viscosity of the gas ) @xcite , or allowing for a slip length @xcite .     + ( a ) @xmath13 ( b )    when the surface of a microchannel is patterned with obstacles , such as posts or ridges , the capillary filling is , in general , suppressed because of pinning on the edges of the posts .",
    "the statics of the pinning can be understood by reference to the gibbs criterion @xcite .",
    "this states that , when a fluid interface reaches a edge , it will remain pinned over the range of angles between the equilibrium contact angle on each of the surfaces bounding the edge as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ gibbsfig](a ) .",
    "a striking consequence of the gibbs criterion is that if there are opposing ridges across the channel it does not fill @xcite .",
    "capillary forces pull the interface until it becomes a flat surface , pinned on the edges as shown in fig .",
    "[ gibbsfig](b ) .",
    "it can not move down the sides of the post from this configuration , and hence will remain pinned .",
    "if the meniscus is moving , however , inertial effects may allow it to overcome the pinning as it reaches the ridge .",
    "then , as the interface moves down the channel it slows , and will eventually pin at a subsequent ridge .",
    "we also note that for nanoscale roughness thermal fluctuations allow the interface to depin and advance @xcite .",
    "if the ridges across the channel are replaced by separated posts capillary filling becomes possible for sufficiently low values of the contact angle .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate how the depinning behaviour depends on the channel geometry and the contact angle , and to explore the depinning mechanism in some detail .",
    "we emphasise the importance of the channel walls in controlling the depinning of the interface and we identify the way in which the interface depins for different channel geometries .",
    "estimates are given for the contact angles at which depinning occurs .    in sec .",
    "[ model ] we define the model we use , summarising the equilibrium properties and the equations of motion .",
    "we then describe the geometry of the channel and list the simulation parameters of the model . in sec .",
    "[ secres ] we present our results . for two typical channels , using values of @xmath14 which do not pin ,",
    "we compare the filling rate to the similar case of a smooth channel ( without obstacles ) , showing how posts on the channel surface slow the filling .",
    "we then concentrate on the filling / pinned transition .",
    "the case in which the posts span the channel and that in which the posts do not meet across the channel are investigated in secs .",
    "[ secheff0 ] and [ secheff ] respectively .",
    "we find that , for high channels and long posts , the pinning - depinning threshold angle @xmath15 .",

    "if the front reaches the free energy minimum which corresponds to pinning with a residual kinetic energy it can overshoot , and hence depin , and it is not possible to entirely eliminate this effect without prohibitively long simulations . indeed in a physical system the front will approach the posts with a finite velocity and whether it will pin will be a balance between @xmath14 and the extent to which the front has been slowed by the viscous drag in the channel .    to demonstrate the effects of inertia close to the depinning transition we investigated filling a channel with @xmath113 , @xmath112 , from the starting configuration shown in fig .",

    "[ visc ] shows the position of the advancing front as a function of time for each case . at early times",
    "lower viscosities give slightly higher speeds .",
    "however , the higher viscosity fluids gain more energy from the walls and have sufficient inertia to move past the pinning position for this contact angle whereas , at least on the timescale of the simulation , the lowest viscosity fluid remains pinned . as anticipated in sec .",
    "[ secheff0 ] , inertial effects are also responsible for the dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath11 , which controls the amount of water advancing between two posts ( or equivalently the scale of the system ) .",
    "we tried to better determine the position of @xmath16 repeating simulations in which @xmath14 was gradually decreased ( by @xmath114 each @xmath115 time steps ) to better reproduce a quasi - static relaxation of the interface . for a channel with @xmath96 we obtained @xmath116 .",
    "however this estimate is very difficult because of the flatness of the free energy profile and the very slow interface velocities .",
    "we stress that , for angles near depinning , inertial effects depend primarily on the way in which the interface is pulled beyond the end of the posts by the surface , but not on its initial position within the microchannel .",
    "hence we expect that this is not just an artifact of the simulations , but that similar inertial effects will occur in experimental systems .",
    "as microfabrication techniques become standard it is becoming possible to design microchannels with complicated internal geometries that may prove useful in controlling fluid behaviour . as a step towards understanding how fluids move in such channels",
    "we have investigated capillary filling in microchannels patterned by regularly spaced square posts .",
    "a consequence of the gibbs criterion is that ridges that face each other across a channel will always pin a slowly moving interface .",
    "we show that , if the ridges are replaced by posts , the interface is able to depin for sufficiently small contact angles .",
    "this is because the meniscus can advance along the surfaces of the channel between the posts , thus allowing depinning to occur .    for posts which span the channel and for a ratio of channel height to distance between the posts",
    "@xmath87 the depinning threshold @xmath16 is independent of @xmath76 because the two surfaces of the channel act independently . @xmath16",
    "lies between @xmath99 and @xmath111 and the posts are wet from the surfaces towards the centre of the channel . for @xmath117 the threshold contact angle increases with decreasing @xmath76 as the surfaces act cooperatively to reduce interface curvature across the channel",
    ". here the posts primarily wet from their sides to their centres .    in the general case in which the posts on opposing sides of the channel are separated by a distance @xmath44",
    "two regimes are present for @xmath87 . at low @xmath44",
    "the filling / pinned transition is similar to that for @xmath73 , with a threshold value of the equilibrium contact angle around @xmath16 and posts which wet from the wall to the centre of the channel . for high enough @xmath44 ,",
    "however , the threshold equilibrium contact angle for depinning increases , and the posts can also wet from the centre of the channel towards the walls during depinning .",
    "these results are in agreement with @xcite , where channels with fixed @xmath6 and @xmath44 and several @xmath11 were considered . in particular in the range @xmath75 , a contact angle threshold compatible with @xmath16",
    "was observed .",
    "on increasing the value of @xmath11 ( i.e.  exploring the @xmath88 regime ) , filling at higher @xmath14 was found , in agreement with our @xmath73 results .",
    "we have concentrated mainly on the quasi - static situation where inertia is neglected and therefore our threshold values are relevant to a very slowly moving interface .",
    "we have , however , shown that close to the threshold even tiny interface velocities can aid depinning .",
    "it will now be interesting to investigate the more general case of a moving interface and assess the extent to which dissipation at the posts can slow and eventually pin the interface for a range of contact angles .",
    "the contact angle of a fluid within a microchannel can rather easily be varied by applying an electrowetting potential .",
    "this opens the possibility of controlling the fluid motion by switching @xmath14 in and out of the pinning regime @xcite .",
    "this is of particular interest in the large @xmath76 regime because the threshold equilibrium contact angle is well approximated by @xmath16 , independent of the channel geometry .",
