    "this kind of behaviour is what is called the _ general threshold model _  @xcite . here",
    "it is assumed that each vertex has one of two states : it is either _ infected _ or  _ susceptible_. furthermore , each vertex of the underlying graph is equipped with a threshold function which depends on the states of its neighbours .",
    "this function expresses the probability that this vertex remains in a particular state given the states of its neighbours .",
    "a central problem in viral marketing is given a network and such a set of functions , find a set of vertices @xmath9 which maximizes the expected number of infected vertices at the end of the process . in  @xcite ,",

    "in this paper , we study an instance of this class of models known as _ bootstrap percolation processes_. this is a threshold model that was introduced in the context of mathematical physics by chalupa , leath and reich  @xcite in 1979 for magnetic disordered systems . a _ bootstrap percolation process _ with _",

    "the process evolves in rounds , where in each round , if a susceptible vertex has at least @xmath12 edges connected to infected neighbours , then it also becomes infected and remains so forever .",

    "such processes ( as well as several variations of them ) have been used as models to describe several complex phenomena in diverse areas , from jamming transitions  @xcite and magnetic systems  @xcite to neuronal activity  @xcite .",
    "bootstrap percolation processes also have connections with the dynamics of the ising model at zero temperature  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
