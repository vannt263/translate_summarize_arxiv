    "optimal choice of @xmath0-values for acquisition of diffusion weighted mr ( dw - mr ) data is still under debate @xcite . in particular",
    ", optimal @xmath0-values should allow for accurate estimation of intravoxel incoherent motion ( ivim ) parameters such as diffusion coefficients and perfusion fraction @xcite .    in principle , for accurate estimation of ivim parameters",
    ", as many @xmath0-values as possible should be used .",
    "however , this is in contrast with clinical requirements such as the duration of the diffusion exam , the confort of the patient etc ... therefore , in clinical literature @xcite typically up to 11 @xmath0-values are commonly used .",
    "depending on the specific field of view , in typical examinations , the acquisition of one @xmath0-value can take a few minutes to complete .",
    "however , accurate estimation of ivim parameters can still be achieved even with a small number of @xmath0-values if they have been opportunely chosen .",
    "previous attempts to design optimal @xmath0-values have been reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they tackled the problem using a monte carlo approach .",
    "this approach is time consuming and has not been applied to find an optimal design for a large region within the parameter space but only for the _ local _ optimal design for a few values of the parameters .",
    "however , it would be desirable to design optimal values for a large region because the specific values for each patient are not known _ a priori _ , of course .",
    "this issue might be overcome using a d - optimal approach .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the problem of @xmath0-values design has not yet been addressed using a d - optimal approach .",
    "this has a sounding mathematical basis and can lead , as we show in this manuscript , to a fast choice of optimal @xmath0-values ( among a set of predefined values ) over a region of the parameters space .",
    "the specific aim of this paper is to show how the design of the @xmath0-values can be simplified performing the search only in the space of the diffusion coefficients and to propose a fast algorithm for finding an ( approximate ) design over an entire region of this space .",
    "the optimal combination of @xmath0-values has been chosen from a set of predefined values taken from the literature .",
    "the reliability of the approximate design has been evaluated on the basis of the cramer - rao lower bound .",
    "the most used model separating the contribute of diffusion and perfusion in intra - voxel incoherent motion has been developed by le bihan @xcite . according to this pioneering paper",
    ", the signal intensity of diffusion weighted mri can be described by eq .",
    "[ eq : ivim1 ] : @xmath4 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is a factor depending on the gradient pulse sequence , @xmath5 is the diffusion coefficient of water , @xmath6 is a pseudo - diffusion coefficient describing blood microcirculation , @xmath1 is the fraction of water flowing in perfused capillary , @xmath7 is the signal intensity when @xmath8 .    as suggested in @xcite , eq .",
    "[ eq : ivim1 ] can be rearranged as in eq .",
    "[ eq : ivim2 ] : @xmath9\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 represents the _ slow _ component of diffusion and @xmath11 represents the _ fast _ component of diffusion .",
    "this form slightly simplifies formula manipulation and will be used in the following .",
    "units of the diffusion coefficients are @xmath12 while @xmath0 is measured in @xmath13 .",
    "typically @xcite , @xmath3 is about @xmath14 while @xmath2 is about @xmath15 . in general @xmath16 .",
    "values for @xmath0 , which is the focus of this paper , falls typically in the range @xmath17 .",
    "perfusion fraction @xmath1 has no units and ranges @xmath18 .",
    "it is well known that , because of noise superimposed to receiving antennas , the measured signal intensity ( @xmath19 ) of diffusion mri data has a rician distribution @xcite as in eq .",
    "[ eq : rician1 ] : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the signal intensity without noise ( which should be given by the ivim model eq .",
    "[ eq : ivim2 ] ) , @xmath22 is the noise level , @xmath23 is the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "it the limit of high signal noise ratio ( snr , @xmath24 ) the distribution can be well approximated by a gaussian distribution @xcite : @xmath25    in our experience , on diffusion images of the prostate at several @xmath0-values from 0 to 1000 , the approximation @xmath26 is very well satisfied .",
    "in fact , for voxels within region of interest ( roi ) the measured intensity @xmath27 is about @xmath28 for @xmath8 decreasing to about @xmath29 when @xmath30 ; the @xmath22 parameter evaluated outside the field of view , gives a value of about @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) . at our institution images",
    "have been obtained using a siemens scanner , 1.5 t , with pulse sequences ep ( sk / sp / osp ) , tr = 7500 ms , te = 91 ms , 3 averages , flip angle = 90 deg .",
    "moreover , the snr measures reported in @xcite confirm that the noise level @xmath22 is typically very low with respect to the signal level @xmath21 .",
    "generalising the previous considerations , in the following we will assume that the hypothesis of gaussian approximation is satisfied ; additionally , we will assume that to a very good approximation @xmath33 as @xmath26 , and therefore the measured signal is : @xmath34 with additive noise @xmath35 .",
    "it is a common approach in ivim literature to normalise dw data @xmath27 dividing by @xmath36 because in so doing the model simplifies to a three parameters model .",
    "typically , a least squares ( ls ) fitting is applied @xcite assuming , implicitly @xcite , that the noise onto the normalised data @xmath37 is additive gaussian .",
    "however , as it has been observed in the previous section , while the noise superimposed on @xmath21 can be well approximated ( for @xmath24 ) by a gaussian distribution , the distribution of @xmath37 becomes a cauchy distribution instead @xcite . as a consequence , the ls approach to non linear fitting , which is derived within the framework of maximum likelihood under the hypothesis of spherical gaussian distribution , might be not adequate in this case .    with this in mind , for @xmath0 design purposes ( section [ sec : design ] ) and for evaluation of attainable accuracy ( section [ sec : accuracy ] )",
    "we consider here a complete 4 parameters model @xmath38 including @xmath7 among the parameters , instead of the common approach to consider the normalised signal .",
    "as underlined in the previous section , dw signal intensities in real cases can be be typically well approximated by a gaussian distribution , implying that the measured signal @xmath27 has an ivim component plus an additive noise component as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ivim3 ] ) : @xmath39 with @xmath40 having gaussian distribution @xmath41 with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath22 , and @xmath42^t$ ] .    under this hypothesis it is possible to use the theory for optimal design of experiments described , for example , in @xcite .",
    "optimal design is based upon the computation of the fisher information matrix of the ivim model , which we perform in the following .",
    "the fisher information matrix corresponding to _ all _ parameters @xmath43^t $ ] is given by eq [ eq : fisher ] : @xmath44 where the partial derivatives of @xmath21 are evaluated at @xmath45 with @xmath46^t$ ] .",
    "however , we note that the model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ivim2 ] ) is conditionally linear in the parameter @xmath7 , thus it can be re - formulated as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and therefore the fisher matrix can be rewritten as : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the identity matrix of size @xmath51 , @xmath52 depends only on @xmath7 and @xmath53\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the four columns of @xmath54 have been indicated by vectors for simplicity .",
    "further simplification can be obtained using the following notation : @xmath55 which gives @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , we indicate with @xmath58 the hadamard product between two vectors e.g. : @xmath59^t;\\ ] ] which gives @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    with this notations the matrix @xmath54 can be rewritten :    @xmath62   \\left (   { \\scalebox{0.75}{\\mbox{\\ensuremath{\\displaystyle   \\begin{matrix } 1-f & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ f &   1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -(1-f ) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -f \\end{matrix } } } } } \\right ) \\\\ & = &   \\mathbf{h}(\\mathbf{b},d_s , d_f ) \\mathbf{b}(f)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    according to the d - optimal design approach we must find the @xmath0 values maximizing the determinant ( @xmath63 ) of the fisher matrix : @xmath64 it is clear that the optimal value for @xmath65 can be found independently from @xmath7 and @xmath1 : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the _ design _ space ( the set of all candidate @xmath0-values ) and @xmath68 a region of interest within the parameters space ( containing the expected values of the parameters ) .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the number of @xmath0-values ( design points ) must be grater ( or equal ) than the total number of parameters @xmath69 ( 4 in this case ) in order for @xmath70 not to be singular . moreover , in a _ continuous design _",
    "@xcite ( i.e. when the number of measurements taken at the design points is very large ) the number of design points is limited superiorly by @xmath71 ( 11 in the present case ) . in passing to a",
    "_ discrete design _",
    "( i.e. a single measure is taken at each design point , as is the case for ivim studies ) the number could be greater than this limit . however , we used 20 as maximum because of the previous considerations ( see introduction section ) concerning the duration of the exam      to compare different designs we used the cramer - rao lower bound ( crlb ) @xcite assuming the parameters estimates are not biased , according to the cramer - rao lower bound theorem @xcite the achievable accuracy is given by the diagonal elements of the inverse fisher information matrix .",
    "the inverse of the fisher matrix is given by : @xmath72    calling @xmath73 with @xmath74 , the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath75 we have the following bounds for the estimated parameters : @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the crlb of the variance of @xmath7 estimator , which is of no interest here .",
    "the square root of crlb ( @xmath78 , @xmath79,@xmath80 ) can be considered the achievable accuracy for the parameter estimate .",
    "we have computed the square root of crlb per each parameter at the @xmath81 d - optimal values ( eq . [ eq : maxfisher ] ) , over the whole parameters region used in the optimisation process .",
    "the region of the parameter space @xmath68 has been chosen on the basis of parameters values found in published literature : see table [ tab : parameterspace ] .",

    "the aim of this paper was to design the @xmath0-values for diffusion weighted mri in an optimal manner suitable for accurate estimation of intra - voxel incoherent motion parameters according to the model in eq .",
    "[ eq : ivim2 ] .",
    "the design has been conducted according to the principles of the d - optimal approach .",
    "optimal combination of @xmath0-values has been chosen within a set of predefined values taken from the literature . as the design is affected from the parameters @xmath82 an exhaustive optimisation within a predefined parameter region has been made .",
    "our results are in line with other studies in literature @xcite , which have been conducted via monte carlo simulation .",
    "two main disadvantages of the approach via monte carlo simulation are : first , in order to have statistical accuracy a large number of simulation must be performed ( typically 1000 ) and per each simulated noisy curve estimation of parameters must be performed ( e.g. via least squares fitting ) ; second , due to computational time only a small portion of the parameters region can be explored in reasonable time .",
    "in fact , least squares fitting of noisy simulated curves is time consuming and if @xmath7 is neglected it might be not suitable to the noise structure on the data ( see section [ sec : noise ] ) . finally , as the parameters values ( @xmath83 ) are not known prior to the mr exam it would be desirable to have a set of @xmath0 values optimised over a large portion of the parameter space .",
    "the approach followed in this study could overcome the above mentioned disadvantages of the monte carlo approach .",
    "in particular , we showed ( section [ sec : design ] ) that the search for a d - optimal design can be addressed in the 2d space of the diffusion parameters only @xmath84 without considering @xmath7 and @xmath1 : this dramatically reduces the computational load .",
    "moreover , we propose a fast algorithm for finding an approximate design : on the basis of crlb analysis we showed that the approximate design is comparable to the exact design ( at least in the case of 5 and 6 points designs ) .",
    "in fact , inspection of table [ tab : optimalapproximate ] and [ tab : optimalexact ] reveals that the approximate designs with 5 and 6 points are only slightly different from the exact 5 and 6 points design .",
    "these similarities is confirmed analysing the crlb in figure [ fig : comparison6pointsdesign ] . from these similarities",
    "we infer that also for higher values of @xmath85 the exact and approximate designs might be very similar ( for @xmath86 the exact and approximate design should converge @xcite ) .",
    "the comparison of 11 points design with the 1000 points design ( see figure [ fig : comparison11pointsdesignperfect ] ) suggest that even with an ideal design the uncertainty over @xmath3 is limited .",
    "furthermore , use of 20 points only slightly improves the accuracy with respect of a 11 points design : this is a useful information in a clinical setting .",
    "a consideration about the hypothesis underlying this study must be made .",
    "we used the approximation of gaussian noise with mean @xmath87 instead of @xmath88 because our aim was the design of @xmath0-values and not the estimation of parameters . as a matter fact , the estimation of parameters is slightly biased and care must be taken in the choice of estimator @xcite    one final remark is the following .",
    "our study has shown that it is possible to search for an optimal @xmath89-point design starting from an ( approximately ) optimal design of @xmath85 points .",
    "this procedure is very fast .",
    "this might suggest an _ adaptive _ strategy for d - optimal design which could be performed during clinical exam : after a first scan using the minimum set of 4 @xmath90-values , an estimate @xmath91 of the parameters is performed over the region of interest ( within the image ) , opportunely selected by the radiologist ; a spatial average of the first estimate might be used for the design of the 5th point ; the procedure can be repeated giving estimates @xmath92 , @xmath93 and so on .",
    "the radiologist can stop after reaching the desired accuracy in the estimates or after a reasonable time .",
    "this adaptive procedure has not been investigated here but will be subject of future studies .",
    "the design of the @xmath0-values for optimal estimation of ivim parameters can be addressed using a d - optimal strategy . in this study",
    "we have shown that the optimal design does not depend on perfusion fraction @xmath1 and therefore the search can be performed in a 2-d space @xmath94 ; moreover , as an exact exhaustive search is still time consuming , we have proposed an iterative algorithm for searching an approximate design starting from an optimal design formed by 4 points .",
