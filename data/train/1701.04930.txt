    "given a system of partial differential equations [ pdes ] over a manifold , does the system of pdes have any local solutions to the cauchy problem ?",
    "that is , given initial conditions on a locally - defined hypersurface , can we produce a local solution that satisfies those initial conditions and also satisfies the pdes ? more generally , which initial hypersurfaces admit such solutions ?",
    "can we do this repeatedly , by solving a sequence of initial - value problems from dimension 0 to 1 , 1 to 2 , and so on to build solutions successively at any point ?",
    "what is the shape of the family of local solutions obtained in this way ?",
    "more generally still , how can we determine whether two systems of pdes are `` the same '' up to local coordinate transformations ? does the space of all pdes ( up to local coordinate transformation ) have any meaningful shape or structure of its own ?    these are the questions at the heart of the subject of exterior differential systems [ eds ] .",
    "however  despite the name ",
    "differential forms are not themselves the core idea in the study of exterior differential systems .",
    "rather , the core idea is to recognize that these questions are more geometric than analytic , and that ideals ( that is , conditions defined by functions ) and varieties ( that is , shapes cut out by functions ) must come into play . to describe families of solutions , we need the geometric language of bundles , schemes , and moduli .",
    "indeed , it is common for researchers entering the subject to become trapped in an endless cycle of translating systems from local jet coordinates to differential forms and back again , without gaining any new geometric insights and without using the most powerful theoretical ideas in eds .",
    "in particular , it can take many years for researchers to appreciate the central role that the characteristic variety plays in uncovering geometric insights .",
    "the goal of these notes is to cut the shortest - possible expository path from the common , elementary concepts of geometry ( linear algebra , vector bundles , and algebraic ideals ) to the advanced theorems about the characteristic variety .",
    "hopefully , these lectures lower the barrier to advanced topics in exterior differential systems by exposing the audience to elementary versions of several key results regarding the characteristic variety , and to outline how these results could be used to push the frontiers of the subject .",
    "these key results are :    1 .",
    "the incidence correspondence of the characteristic variety , 2 .",
    "guillemin normal form and quillen s thesis , 3 .",
    "the integrability of characteristics ( guillemin , quillen , sternberg , gabber ) , 4 .",
    "yang s hyperbolicity criterion .",
    "the required background for these lectures is graduate - level linear algebra ( short - exact sequences , dual spaces , the rank - nullity theorem , tensor products , generalized eigenspaces , as in artin s _ algebra _",
    "@xcite ) , the fundamentals of smooth manifolds ( tangent spaces , sard s theorem , bundles , as in milnor s _ topology from the differential viewpoint _ @xcite ) and basic algebraic geometry ( projective space , ideal , variety , scheme , as in harris _ algebraic geometry , a first course _",
    "these lectures assume that the audience has a general cultural awareness of pdes or eds in some form but the required definitions are provided .",
    "even so , it is wise always to have bryant , et al.s _ exterior differential systems _ @xcite and ivey and landsberg s _ cartan for beginners _",
    "@xcite nearby .",
    "they are cited for comparison frequently .",
    "everything in these pages can be found in numerous places in the literature in some form or other ; i have indicated my favorite sources throughout .",
    "the only innovations here are in presentation :    1 .",
    "the central topic is the @xmath0 characteristic variety , not the @xmath1 cartan  khler theorem .",
    "this is because i am interested in the question `` what does the family of all pdes look like ? ''",
    "not `` how do i solve this particular pde ? ''",
    "guillemin normal form for tableaux and symbols plays the central computational role , not differential forms .",
    "this is because most humans  and their computer algebra systems  are more comfortable with matrices than with exterior algebra .",
    "exterior differential ideals are not introduced until absolutely needed .",
    "this is because many of the essential lemmas depend only on the geometry of the grassmann variety , which is the variety of the trivial exterior differential system .    for readability ,",
    "many proofs are omitted or reduced to discussion in prose .",
    "this should not be an impediment to understanding or to precision .",
    "most of the proofs are basic linear algebra ( in fact , almost all the key results are restatements of the rank - nullity theorem ) , and details are provided in the references .    [ part : back ]",
    "tableaux are very simple objects ; every undergraduate encounters the example `` @xmath2 matrices form a vector space using the usual matrix operations , '' and a tableau is any subspace of that vector space .",
    "given vector spaces or projective spaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 , a _ tableau _ is a linear subspace of @xmath5 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath6 and @xmath7 interchangeably , and eventually we switch from vector spaces to complex projective spaces for algebraic convenience .    being a subspace ,",
    "any tableau @xmath8 is the kernel of some linear map @xmath9 , called the _ symbol _ , whose range is written as @xmath10 .",
    "we have a short exact sequence of spaces : @xmath11 where @xmath10 is just notation for @xmath12 .",

    "thus , for any tableau @xmath22 , we could ask how @xmath23 varies across @xmath24 . for our purposes ,",
    "the most interesting across @xmath24 comes down to the rank-1 case .",

    "the space @xmath6 admits the _ rank - one ideal _ , @xmath26 , which is irreducible and generated by all @xmath27 minors @xmath28 in any basis .",

    "we would like to find a `` good '' basis in which to express a tableau @xmath8 and study its properties .",
    "first , an analogy",
    ". when studying a single homomorphism @xmath37 , there are various `` good '' bases to express @xmath38 .",
    "a basis of @xmath39 is `` generic '' for @xmath38 if the first @xmath40 columns are independent .",
    "a basis of @xmath41 is `` generic '' for @xmath38 if the first @xmath40 rows of @xmath38 are independent in that basis . among the generic bases ,",
    "we can construct particularly `` good '' bases for writing @xmath38 .",
    "when @xmath38 is written in a `` good '' basis , we say it is in a `` normal form , '' and the normal form allows us readily to study properties of @xmath38 .",
    "for example :    * use gaussian elimination to place @xmath38 in reduced row - echelon form .",
    "then , the rank , kernel , and image of @xmath38 are immediately apparent .",
    "the fundamental theorems in linear algebra depend on this normal form . *",
    "apply a polar / unitary decomposition to find the singular - value decomposition of @xmath38 .",
    "then , the norm of @xmath38 and its action with respect to the hermitian inner products of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are immediately apparent .",
    "important theorems in metric geometry and multivariate statistics depend on this normal form . *",
    "solve a sequence of eigenvalue problems in the case @xmath44 to find jordan normal form .",
    "then , the eigenspace structure of @xmath38 , and the commutative algebra of matrices to which it belongs are immediately apparent .",
    "the theory of lie groups and lie algebras depends on this normal form .",
    "given a tableau @xmath45 with symbol @xmath9 , we are curious whether we can construct bases that are `` good '' simultaneously for all homomorphisms in the tableau .",
    "this situation is considerably more complicated than the situation of a single homomorphism , and it turns out that it is most important to focus on the symbol maps , but we arrive at a satisfying answer in section  [ sec : inveig ] . by the above analogy , it is convenient to have a notion of `` generic '' bases formulated in terms of independence .",
    "here is the first step :    in any bases of @xmath46 and @xmath3 , the tableau @xmath8 is a space of @xmath2 matrices only @xmath47 of whose entries are linearly independent .",
    "that is , in a given basis , we can consider the entries @xmath48 as elements of @xmath49 , just as we think of the components @xmath50 of vectors in @xmath4 as being linear functions on @xmath51 , using the dual basis of @xmath46 .    across all bases of @xmath46",
    ", there is a maximum number of independent entries that can occur in column 1 ; call that number @xmath52 .",
    "( in a measure - zero set of bases of @xmath46 , the number of actual independent entries in the first column may may be less than @xmath52 . )",

    "continuing in this way , we have @xmath57 as the number of new independent entries in the @xmath58th column achieved for almost - all bases of @xmath46 .",
    "( in a measure - zero set of bases of @xmath46 that achieve @xmath59 in columns 1 through @xmath60 , the number of actual independent entries in columns 1 through @xmath58 may be less than @xmath61 . ) eventually , for such a basis , there is a column @xmath62 where we have reached @xmath63 , so there is some maximum column @xmath64 such that @xmath65 , where the last independent entry appears .",
    "so , @xmath66 the index @xmath62 is called the _ character _ of @xmath8 , and the number @xmath67 is called the _ cartan integer _ of @xmath8 .",

    "thus , we expect that the condition `` @xmath1020 is the characteristic scheme of an exterior differential system @xmath452 , and @xmath1023 is involutive '' is much weaker than `` @xmath1020 is the characteristic scheme of an exterior differential system @xmath452 , and @xmath452 is involutive . ''",
    "the gap between these two statements is extremely important to explore , as it goes to the heart of the question about how involutivity leads to solutions of the initial - value problem for a system of pdes . to put this a different way , can we construct an embedded variety @xmath1099 that is involutive , but for which there is _ no _ involutive exterior differential system for which @xmath572 is the characteristic variety ? 6 .",
    "global integrability of the characteristic variety .",
    "if @xmath8 is involutive , then the system @xmath1022 is involutive on an ordinary integral manifold , @xmath409 .",
    "however , it is not clear whether there is sense in which @xmath1100 is involutive over @xmath471 itself .",
    "that is , consider the eds on @xmath471 generated by adding a smooth section @xmath270 to @xmath527 . under what circumstances",
    "is this involutive ?",
    "can gabber s theorem be adopted to this case ?",
    "this has theoretical implications for special integrability conditions ( below ) .",
    "additionally , given its algebraic nature , can gabber s theorem provide solutions for certain types of pdes with low regularity ? 7 .   the prolongation theorem .",
    "does prolongation always uncover solutions of an exterior differential system , if we remove the regularity assumptions on @xmath471 and consider the many components of the scheme @xmath1101 ?",
    "as experts are well aware , this is has been the key open question in the subject for most of a century .",
    "( see ( * ? ? ? * chapter  vi ) . ) in the context of this monograph , the question is related to whether the block - form of involutive tableau and the involutivity conditions of theorem  [ thm : invcond ] can be extended from @xmath471 to non - smooth points in @xmath464 ? because of the interaction of guillemin normal form and involutivity with spencer cohomology as in section  [ sec : gnf ] , such an extension of the endovolutive block - form could be helpful in an effort to construct ( or prove the non - existence of ) counterexamples .",
    "representation theory of lie pseudogroups .",
    "lie pseudogroups are subgroups of the diffeomorphism pseudogroup whose trajectories are the solutions of involutive pdes .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "just as jordan form ( in the guise of the levi decomposition ) is the key first step toward understanding the representation of lie groups , it is reasonable to expect that the endovolutive block - form and theorem  [ thm : invcond ] can serve as the foundation of a representation theory of lie pseudo - groups .",
    "any results regarding the `` moduli of involutive tableaux '' can be applied to lie pseudogroups with those tableaux .",
    "indeed , the first application of theorem  [ thm : intchar1 ] was the classification of the primitive lie pseudogroups @xcite .",
