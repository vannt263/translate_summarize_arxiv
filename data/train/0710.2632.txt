    "in @xcite , pierce and tian studied the self - similar solutions of the whitham equations which describe the zero dispersion limits of the kdv hierarchy . the main feature of the whitham equations for the higher members of the hierarchy , of which the kdv equation is the first member , is that these whitham equations are neither strictly hyperbolic nor genuinely nonlinear .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the case of the kdv equation whose whitham equations are strictly hyperbolic and genuinely nonlinear [ lax2 ] . in this paper , we extend their studies to the case of the complex modified kdv equation , which is the second member of the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger hierarchy .",
    "the whitham equations for the defocusing nls equation are strictly hyperbolic and genuinely nonlinear , and they have been studied extensively ( see for examples , @xcite ) . however , for the mkdv equation , the whitham equations are neither strictly hyperbolic nor genuinely nonlinear .",
    "let us begin with a brief description of the zero dispersion limit of the solution of the nls equation @xmath0 with the initial data @xmath1 here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are real functions that are independent of @xmath4 .",
    "writing the solution @xmath5 , and using the notation @xmath6 , @xmath7 , one obtains the conservation form of the defocusing nls equation @xmath8    the mass density @xmath9 and momentum density @xmath10 have weak limits as @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "these limits satisfy a @xmath12 system of hyperbolic equations @xmath13 until its solution develops a shock . system ( [ nlshydro0 ] ) can be rewritten in the diagonal form for @xmath14 , @xmath15 where the riemann invariants @xmath16 and @xmath17 are given by @xmath18    as a simple example , we consider the case with @xmath19constant . system ( [ nls0 ] ) reduces to a single equation @xmath20 the solution is given by the implicit form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the initial data for @xmath23 .",
    "one can easily see that if @xmath24 decreases in some region , then @xmath25 develops a shock in a finite time , i.e. , @xmath26 becomes singular .",
    "after the shock formation in the solution of ( [ nlshydro0 ] ) or ( [ nls0 ] ) , the weak limits are described by the nls - whitham equations , which can also be put in the riemann invariant form @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 are expressed in terms of complete hyperelliptic integrals of genus @xmath29 @xcite . here",
    "the number @xmath29 is exactly the number of phases in the nls oscillations with small dispersion .",
    "accordingly , the zero phase @xmath30 corresponds to no oscillations , and single and higher phases @xmath31 correspond to the nls oscillations .",
    "system ( [ nls0 ] ) is viewed as the zero phase whitham equations .",
    "the solution of the whitham equations ( [ nlsw ] ) for @xmath31 then describes the averaged motion of the oscillations appearing in the solution of ( [ nls ] ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "let us discuss the most important @xmath32 case in more detail .",
    "we note that it is well known that the kdv oscillatory solution , in the single phase regime , can be approximately described by the kdv periodic solution when the dispersive parameter is small @xcite .",
    "it is very possible to use the method of @xcite to show that the solution of the nls equation ( [ nls ] ) for small @xmath4 can be approximately described , in the single phase regime , by the periodic solution of the nls equation .",
    "the nls periodic solution has the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 and the velocity @xmath35 . here",
    "s are determined by the equation obtained from ( [ nlshydro ] ) @xmath37 with @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the jacobi elliptic function with the modulus @xmath40 .",
    "we can also write @xmath36 s as @xcite @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "the velocity @xmath43 is then given by @xmath44 for constants @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , formula ( [ periodicsolution ] ) gives the well known elliptic solution of the nls equation .",
    "to describe the solution @xmath49 of the nls equation ( [ nlshydro ] ) , the quantities @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are instead functions of @xmath50 and @xmath51 and they evolve according to the single phase whitham equations ( [ nlsw ] ) for @xmath32 .    the weak limit of @xmath49 of nls equation ( [ nls ] ) as @xmath11 can be expressed in terms of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind , respectively .",

    "for instance , we consider the whitham equations with the initial data @xcite @xmath66 now notice that the whitham equations ( [ nlsw ] ) for @xmath32 with the initial data ( [ regular ] ) can be reduced to a single equation @xmath67 .",
    "the equation has a global self - similar solution , which is implicitly given by @xmath68 .",

    "the oscillations describe a dispersive shock of the nls equation under a small dispersion .",
    "note here that the oscillations have a uniform structure , which is due to an almost linear profile of the whitham solution @xmath47 .",

    "on the right hand side is the oscillatory solution given by ( [ periodicsolution ] ) ( respectively ( [ periodicsolution2 ] ) for mkdv ) at @xmath87 , while the dark plot is the weak limit ( [ average ] ) of the oscillatory solution at @xmath87 , both plots on the right are also exact . in the first two figures we demark the region where the whitham equations with @xmath32 govern the solution , place a dashed - dotted line where the behavior of the oscillatory solution changes , and label the four functions @xmath80",
    "the demarcation and labeling are similar in the other figures and we will leave them off for brevity . although we do not include any numerical simulations , we would like to mention that e. overman showed us his numerical simulation of the nls and mkdv equations which captures the features of the oscillatory solutions plotted in this paper .",
    "the defocusing nls equation is just the first member of the defocusing nls hierarchy ; the second is the ( defocusing ) complex modified kdv ( mkdv ) equation @xmath88 we again use @xmath5 and notation @xmath89 , @xmath90 to obtain the conservation form of the mkdv equation @xmath91 } \\ , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath92    the mass density @xmath93 and momentum density @xmath94 for the mkdv equation also have weak limits as @xmath11 @xcite .",

    ", the system reduces to a single equation @xmath99 as in the nls case , we consider the initial function given by @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "we recall that , in the nls case , the zero phase solution of ( [ nls0 ] ) develops a shock if and only if @xmath65 .",
    "however , the solution in the mkdv case develops a shock for @xmath104 if and only if @xmath105 .",
    "in addition , if @xmath106 , the solution in the mkdv case develop a shock if and only if @xmath107 .",
    "these differences between the mkdv and nls cases are due to the weak hyperbolicity of the system ( [ mkdv0 ] ) ( note that for the eigenspeed @xmath108 for @xmath23 , we have @xmath109 which can change sign ) . as will be shown below , this leads to an additional structure in the dispersive shock for the mkdv case .    as in the case of the nls equation ,",
    "immediately after the shock formation in the solution of ( [ mkdvhydro0 ] ) , the weak limits are described by the mkdv - whitham equations @xmath110 where @xmath111 s can also be expressed in terms of complete hyperelliptic integrals of genus @xmath29 @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the solution of the whitham equations ( [ mkdvw ] ) with @xmath32 when the initial mass density @xmath112 and momentum density @xmath113 are step functions . in view of ( [ nsfii ] ) , this amounts to requiring @xmath97 and @xmath23 of system ( [ mkdv0 ] ) to have step - like initial data .",
    "we are interested in the following two cases :    * @xmath114 is a constant and @xmath115 * @xmath116 is a constant and @xmath117    in the case of the nls equation , the genuine nonlinearity of the single phase whitham equations ( see ( [ eq11 ] ) ) warrants that the solution is found by the implicit function theorem .",
    "however the mkdv - whitham equations ( [ mkdvw ] ) , in general , are not genuinely nonlinear , that is , a property like ( [ eq11 ] ) is not available ( see lemma [ lem2.1 ] below ) .",
