    "we are interested in a diffractive process @xmath1 , in which one of the colliding protons remains intact .",
    "the other dissociates into a system of particles well separated in rapidity from the intact proton .",
    "the diffraction is called soft if there is no hard scale involved , _",
    "i.e. _ all transverse momenta of the final state particles are much smaller than the proton mass .",
    "the self - consistent description of this kind of processes is an important problem .",
    "the regge theory is traditionally used to determine the cross sections . however , in the case of soft diffraction , the regge approach based on the triple pomeron picture , fails to describe the diffractive cross section for center of mass energies higher than about 20 gev @xcite .",
    "this signals violation of unitarity in the pomeron approach which occurs for much lower energies than in the case of fully inclusive cross section .",
    "the way out of this problem was proposed some time ago by goulianos who introduced , somewhat _ ad  hoc _ , the renormalization of the pomeron flux  @xcite .",
    "however , diffractive dissociation may be also analyzed in the framework different than the regge model . in this paper",
    "we present another approach proposed by good and walker @xcite which is based , from the very beginning , on the requirement of unitarity of the scattering matrix .",
    "the results presented here are obtained using the miettinen - pumplin @xcite realization of the  good - walker picture .",
    "in the good - walker picture of soft diffraction the state of the incident hadron which subsequently dissociates is expanded into a superposition of eigenstates of the scattering operator @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 where from unitarity : @xmath5 . in general case",
    "different eigenstates are absorbed by the target with different intensity , hence the outgoing state is no longer @xmath6 and , by this mechanism , the inelastic production of particles takes place .",
    "the inelastic diffractive cross section is proportional to the dispersion of the absorption coefficients @xmath7 .",
    "the miettinen - pumplin model is based on this simple picture of good and walker introducing new important element .",
    "the basic assumption is that the eigenstates of diffraction are wee parton states @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of partons , and @xmath10 are rapidity and impact parameter ( relative to the center of the projectile ) of parton @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ expansion ] ) takes the form @xmath12 the probability @xmath13 associated with @xmath9 partons , which are assumed to be independent , is given by poisson distribution with mean number @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the single wee parton distribution probability .",
    "similarly the interaction probability @xmath7 of the state with @xmath9 partons can be expressed in terms of the single wee parton interaction probability @xmath17 @xmath18 to describe distribution and interactions of single wee partons miettinen and pumplin took @xmath19 @xmath20 with some further assumptions the number of parameters of the model may be reduced so that it depends only on @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath14 .",
    "namely , @xmath22 , its maximal possible value while @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it turns out that @xmath25 and @xmath26 enter only as their ratio .",
    "finally , we arrive at the following formulae for the differential total , elastic and single diffractive cross sections @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 the two remaining parameters , @xmath30 and @xmath14 , can be determined for a given center of mass energy @xmath31 from experimental data for @xmath32 and @xmath33 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tot ] ) and ( [ eq : el ] ) .",
    "the diffractive cross section can be then _ predicted _ from eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) .",
    "miettinen and pumplin performed calculations for two colliding protons at the isr center of mass energy @xmath34 .",
    "they obtained the value for @xmath35 which was in good agreement with the data .",
    "we present this result in fig .",
    "[ fig : tevatron - diff ] and refer to it as m&p .",
    "we have applied the model described in the previous section for the center of mass energies 546 gev and 1800 gev @xcite . the results together with experimental data and the goulianos model predictions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tevatron - diff ] .",
    "we used cdf  @xcite data for the total and elastic cross sections as an input at the energy 546 gev .",
    "the two predictions of the miettinen - pumplin model for @xmath36 are a consequence of two different results for @xmath32 and @xmath33 measured by cdf  @xcite and e811  @xcite .",
    "we see that the miettinen - pumplin model remains valid in the isr - tevatron energy range , _",
    "i.e. _ for three orders of magnitude in the center of mass energy @xmath31 .",
    "it gives values of diffractive cross section which are in reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "it is also possible to determine within the model the elastic and diffractive slopes by applying fourier transform to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : el ] ) and ( [ eq : diff ] ) .",
    "we have checked that both slopes are consistent with existing experimental data ( see  @xcite ) which undoubtly makes the miettinen - pumplin model more trustworthy .    -0.2",
    "-0.2 cm    encouraged by the success of the miettinen - pumplin model for the highest currently available energy of tevatron , we have proposed a method of determining the total , elastic and diffractive cross sections at the lhc @xcite .    in order to obtain these predictions we have extrapolated the two parameters of the model @xmath30 and @xmath14 to the lhc energy @xmath37 .",
    "for this purpose we plotted the obtained values of @xmath30 and @xmath14 as a functions of energy and found that up to the tevatron value of @xmath31 the dependence of both parameters is , to good approximation , linear in @xmath38 .",
    "thus we extrapolated this dependence to the lhc energy by fitting straight lines to the existing data points .",
    "it is interesting to note that with the assumption of the linear dependence , the total cross section for high @xmath31 behaves like @xmath39 which is smaller than @xmath40 and therefore does not violate the froissart - martin bound @xcite .    when fitting the energy dependence , we faced the problem pointed out already in the previous section , _",
    "i.e. _ discrepancy between e811 and cdf results for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "thus we decided to treat these two cases separately considering two scenarios .",
    "the results are presented in table [ cs - results ] .",
    "the indicated errors come from uncertainties in the determination of parameters and were computed by using the total differential method .",

    "-0.2 cm    as we see the miettinen - pumplin model with assumed logarithmic dependence of its two parameters @xmath30 and @xmath14 on center of mass energy predicts the total cross section for the lhc 15% smaller than that determined by donnachie and landshoff @xcite .",
    "this difference can be attributed to unitarity which is an inherent feature of this model .",
    "the value of the diffracitve cross section at the lhc is only slightly higher than that found at tevatron and is close to the prediction of the goulianos model . despite this simillary ,",
    "the two models give qualitatively different behaviour of the diffractive cross section .",
    "the model of miettinen and pumplin predicts @xmath35 almost constant in the tevatron - lhc energy range while in the goulianos model the diffractive cross section grows with energy .",
    "we have analyzed the soft diffractive dissociation in hadronic collisions at high energies in the framework of the miettinen - pumplin model .    we have found correct description of the single diffractive cross section at center of mass energies ranging from isr to tevatron .",
    "we have also presented predictions for the lhc , finding the total inclusive cross section 15% smaller then that determined by donnachie and landshoff .",
