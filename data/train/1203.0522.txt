    "tropical mathematics can be treated as a result of a dequantization of the traditional mathematics as the planck constant tends to zero taking imaginary values .",
    "this kind of dequantization is known as the maslov dequantization and it leads to a mathematics over tropical algebras like the max - plus algebra .",
    "the so - called idempotent dequantization is a generalization of the maslov dequantization .",
    "the idempotent dequantization leads to mathematics over idempotent semirings ( exact definitions see below in sections 2 and 3 ) .",
    "for example , the field of real or complex numbers can be treated as a quantum object whereas idempotent semirings can be examined as `` classical '' or `` semiclassical '' objects ( a semiring is called idempotent if the semiring addition is idempotent , i.e. @xmath0 ) , see  @xcite .",
    "some other dequantization procedures lead to interesting applications , e.g. , to convex geometry , see below and @xcite .",
    "tropical algebras are idempotent semirings ( and semifields ) .",
    "thus tropical mathematics is a part of idempotent mathematics .",
    "tropical algebraic geometry can be regarded as a result of the maslov dequantization applied to the traditional algebraic geometry ( o. viro , g. mikhalkin ) , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",

    "there is a ( heuristic ) correspondence between important , useful , and interesting constructions and results over fields and similar constructions and results over idempotent semirings .",
    "a systematic application of this correspondence principle leads to a variety of theoretical and applied results  @xcite , see figure  [ f : bohr ] .",
    "the history of the subject is discussed , e.g. , in  @xcite , with extensive bibliography .",

    "maslov s idempotent superposition principle means that many nonlinear problems related to extremal problems are linear over suitable idempotent semirings .",

    "it can be easily checked that @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "this deformation of the algebraic structure borrowed from  @xmath6 brings us to the semifield @xmath17 , known as the _ max - plus algebra _ , with zero @xmath18 and unit @xmath19 .",
    "the semifield @xmath17 is a typical example of an _ idempotent semiring _ ; this is a semiring with idempotent addition , i.e. , @xmath20 for arbitrary element @xmath21 of this semiring .",

    "the analogy with quantization is obvious ; the parameter @xmath14 plays the role of the planck constant . the map @xmath30 and the maslov dequantization for @xmath6 give us a natural transition from the field @xmath2 ( or @xmath1 ) to the max - plus algebra @xmath17 .",

    "* the term tropical appeared in  @xcite for a discrete version of the max - plus algebra ( as a suggestion of christian choffrut ) . on the other hand v.p .",

    "examples are discussed below ; see also @xcite",
    "idempotent analysis deals with functions taking their values in an idempotent semiring and the corresponding function spaces .",
    "idempotent analysis was initially constructed by v.  p.  maslov and his collaborators and then developed by many authors .",
    "the subject is presented in the book of v.  n.  kolokoltsov and v.  p.  maslov  @xcite ( a version of this book in russian was published in 1994 ) .",
    "let @xmath32 be an arbitrary semiring with idempotent addition @xmath33 ( which is always assumed to be commutative ) , multiplication @xmath24 , and unit @xmath45 .",
    "the set @xmath32 is equipped with the _ standard partial order _",
    "@xmath46 : by definition , @xmath47 if and only if @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath32 contains a zero element @xmath49 , then all elements of @xmath32 are nonnegative : @xmath50 @xmath51 for all @xmath52 . due to the existence of this order , idempotent analysis",
    "is closely related to the lattice theory , theory of vector lattices , and theory of ordered spaces . moreover , this partial order allows to model a number of basic `` topological '' concepts and results of idempotent analysis on the purely algebraic level ; this line of reasoning was examined systematically in  @xcite  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "calculus deals mainly with functions whose values are numbers . the idempotent analog of a numerical function is a map @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is an arbitrary set and @xmath32 is an idempotent semiring",
    ". functions with values in @xmath32 can be added , multiplied by each other , and multiplied by elements of @xmath32 pointwise .",
    "the idempotent analog of a linear functional space is a set of @xmath32-valued functions that is closed under addition of functions and multiplication of functions by elements of @xmath32 , or an @xmath32-semimodule .",
    "consider , e.g. , the @xmath32-semimodule @xmath55 of all functions @xmath53 that are bounded in the sense of the standard order on @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath56 , then the idempotent analog of integration is defined by the formula @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "indeed , a riemann sum of the form @xmath59 corresponds to the expression @xmath60 , which tends to the right - hand side of   as @xmath61 .",
    "of course , this is a purely heuristic argument .",
    "formula   defines the _ idempotent _ ( or _ maslov _ ) _ integral _ not only for functions taking values in @xmath62 , but also in the general case when any of bounded ( from above ) subsets of  @xmath32 has the least upper bound .",
    "an _ idempotent _ ( or _ maslov _ ) _ measure _ on @xmath54 is defined by the formula @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a fixed function .",
    "the integral with respect to this measure is defined by the formula @xmath65    obviously , if @xmath66 , then the standard order is opposite to the conventional order @xmath67 , so in this case equation   takes the form @xmath68 where @xmath69 is understood in the sense of the conventional order @xmath67 .",
    "we shall see that in idempotent analysis measures and generalized functions ( versions of distributions in the sense of l.  schwartz ) are generated by usual functions .",
    "for example the @xmath70-functional @xmath71 is generated by the function @xmath72 it is clear that @xmath73 .",
    "basic equations of quantum theory are linear ; this is the superposition principle in quantum mechanics .",
    "the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation , the basic equation of classical mechanics , is nonlinear in the conventional sense .",
    "however , it is linear over the semirings @xmath62 and @xmath74 .",
    "similarly , different versions of the bellman equation , the basic equation of optimization theory , are linear over suitable idempotent semirings ; this is v.  p.  maslov s idempotent superposition principle , see @xcite .",
    "more generally , the idempotent superposition principle means that although some important problems and equations ( related to extremal problems , e.g. , optimization problems , the bellman equation and its instances , the hamilton - jacobi equation ) are nonlinear in the usual sense , they can be treated as linear over appropriate idempotent semirings .",
    "for instance , the finite - dimensional stationary bellman equation can be written in the form @xmath75 , where @xmath54 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 are matrices with coefficients in an idempotent semiring @xmath32 and the unknown matrix @xmath54 is determined by @xmath76 and @xmath77 , see below and  @xcite . in particular , standard problems of dynamic programming and the well - known shortest path problem correspond to the cases @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "it is known that principal optimization algorithms for finite graphs correspond to standard methods for solving systems of linear equations of this type ( i.e. , over semirings ) .",
    "specifically , bellman s shortest path algorithm corresponds to a version of jacobi s algorithm , ford s algorithm corresponds to the gauss ",
    "seidel iterative scheme , etc .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the linearity of the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation over @xmath74 and @xmath62 , which is the result of the maslov dequantization of the schrdinger equation , is closely related to the ( conventional ) linearity of the schrdinger equation and can be deduced from this linearity .",
    "thus , it is possible to borrow standard ideas and methods of linear analysis and apply them to a new area .    consider a classical dynamical system specified by the hamiltonian @xmath80 where @xmath81 are generalized coordinates , @xmath82 are generalized momenta , @xmath83 are generalized masses , and @xmath84 is the potential . in this case",
    "the lagrangian @xmath85 has the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "the value function @xmath89 of the action functional has the form @xmath90 where the integration is performed along the actual trajectory of the system .",
    "the classical equations of motion are derived as the stationarity conditions for the action functional ( the hamilton principle , or the least action principle ) .    for fixed values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 and arbitrary trajectories",
    "@xmath93 , the action functional @xmath94 can be considered as a function taking the set of curves ( trajectories ) to the set of real numbers which can be treated as elements of @xmath74 . in this case",
    "the minimum of the action functional can be viewed as the maslov integral of this function over the set of trajectories or an idempotent analog of the euclidean version of the feynman path integral .",
    "the minimum of the action functional corresponds to the maximum of @xmath95 , i.e. idempotent integral @xmath96 with respect to the max - plus algebra @xmath97 .",
    "thus the least action principle can be considered as an idempotent version of the well - known feynman approach to quantum mechanics .",
    "the representation of a solution to the schrdinger equation in terms of the feynman integral corresponds to the lax ",
    "olenik solution formula for the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation .    since @xmath98 , @xmath99 , the following hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation holds : @xmath100    quantization leads to the schrdinger equation @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the wave function , i.e. , a time - dependent element of the hilbert space @xmath103 , and @xmath104 is the energy operator obtained by substitution of the momentum operators @xmath105 and the coordinate operators @xmath106 for the variables @xmath107 and @xmath108 in the hamiltonian function , respectively .",
    "this equation is linear in the conventional sense ( the quantum superposition principle ) .",
    "the standard procedure of limit transition from the schrdinger equation to the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation is to use the following ansatz for the wave function : @xmath109 , and to keep only the leading order as @xmath110 ( the ` semiclassical ' limit ) .    instead of doing this",
    ", we switch to imaginary values of the planck constant @xmath111 by the substitution @xmath112 , assuming @xmath113 .",
    "then the schrdinger equation   becomes similar to the heat equation : @xmath114 where the real - valued function @xmath115 corresponds to the wave function @xmath116 .",
    "a similar idea ( a switch to imaginary time ) is used in the euclidean quantum field theory ; let us remember that time and energy are dual quantities .",
    "linearity of equation   implies linearity of equation  .",
    "thus if @xmath117 and @xmath118 are solutions of  , then so is their linear combination @xmath119    let @xmath120 or @xmath121 as in section  [ s : dequant ] above .",
    "it can easily be checked that equation   thus turns to @xmath122 thus we have a transition from   to   by means of the change of variables @xmath123 .",
    "note that @xmath124 , where re@xmath32 is the real part of @xmath32 .",
    "now let us consider @xmath32 as a real variable .",
    "the equation   is nonlinear in the conventional sense .",
    "however , if @xmath125 and @xmath126 are its solutions , then so is the function @xmath127 obtained from   by means of the substitution @xmath120 . here the generalized multiplication @xmath24 coincides with the ordinary addition and the generalized addition @xmath128 is the image of the conventional addition under the above change of variables .",
    "as @xmath129 , we obtain the operations of the idempotent semiring @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , and equation   becomes the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation  , since the third term in the right - hand side of equation   vanishes .",
    "thus it is natural to consider the limit function @xmath132 as a solution of the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation and to expect that this equation can be treated as linear over @xmath62 .",
    "this argument ( clearly , a heuristic one ) can be extended to equations of a more general form . for a rigorous treatment of ( semiring ) linearity for these equations",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "notice that if @xmath14 is changed to @xmath133 , then we have that the resulting hamilton  jacobi equation is linear over @xmath74 .",
    "the idempotent superposition principle indicates that there exist important nonlinear ( in the traditional sense ) problems that are linear over idempotent semirings . the idempotent linear functional analysis ( see below ) is a natural tool for investigation of those nonlinear infinite - dimensional problems that possess this property .      a rigorous `` idempotent '' appproach to the investigation of the hamilton - jacobi equation was developed by v.n .",
    "kolokoltsov and v.p .",
    "maslov  @xcite ( a russian version of this book was published in 1994 ) ; see also  @xcite .",
    "let us consider , inspired by a long tradition , the well - known cauchy problem for the hamilton - jacobi equation  .",
    "given the action function at time @xmath134 @xmath135 the cauchy problem asks to reconstruct @xmath136 for @xmath137 during the time interval @xmath138 .",
    "we shall discuss the min - plus linearity of this problem and denote by @xmath139 the resolving operator , i.e. the map which assigns to each given @xmath140 the solution @xmath136 of the cauchy problem in the interval @xmath138 .",
    "then the map @xmath139 , for each @xmath91 , is a linear ( over @xmath74 ) operator in the space lsc@xmath141 of lower semicontinuous functions taking their values in @xmath74 .",
    "moreover @xmath139 is an integral operator ( in the sense of idempotent mathematics ) of the form : @xmath142 where @xmath143 , as a function of @xmath144 , is bounded from below and lower semicontinuous .",
    "see  @xcite for details .",
    "the operator @xmath139 ( as well as other integral operators , see section  [ s : funcan ] below ) has the following property : @xmath145 where @xmath146 is a bounded set of elements in lsc@xmath141 .",
    "so if we have such a family of functions @xmath147 and @xmath148 , then the solution of the cauchy problem is expressed as @xmath149 .",
    "relations between the `` idempotent approach '' , viscosity solutions and minimax solutions in the sense of a.i .",
    "subbotin  @xcite are examined , e.g. , in  @xcite in details ; see also w.m .",
    "mceneaney  @xcite .",
    "to this end , let us mention that more general hamiltonians of the form @xmath150 ( satisfying some additional conditions ) and different kinds of solution spaces are also considered in the literature .",
    "the situation is similar for the cauchy problem for the homogeneous hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath151 where @xmath152 is a convex ( not strictly ) first order homogeneous function @xmath153 and @xmath154 is a compact set in @xmath155 .",
    "see  @xcite .    to develop a rigorous `` idempotent '' approach to differential equations and other problems",
    ", one needs an idempotent version of analysis and , especially , functional analysis .",
    "see section  [ s : funcan ] below .",
    "let @xmath156 be a group",
    ". then the space @xmath157 of all bounded functions @xmath158 ( see above ) is an idempotent semiring with respect to the following analog @xmath159 of the usual convolution : @xmath160 of course , it is possible to consider other `` function spaces '' ( and other basic semirings instead of @xmath97 ) .",

    "of course , this construction can be generalized to different classes of groups and semirings .",
    "transformations of this type convert the generalized convolution @xmath159 to the pointwise ( generalized ) multiplication and possess analogs of some important properties of the usual fourier transform .",

    "when @xmath272 is symmetric about the principal diagonal and the semiring over which the matrix is defined is commutative , the algorithm can be modified in such a way that the number of operations is reduced approximately by a factor of two .",
    "other examples can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that to compute the matrices @xmath682 and @xmath688 it is convenient to solve the bellman equation  ( [ ax+bb ] ) .",
    "some other interesting and important problems of linear algebra over semirings are examined , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that linear problems and equations are especially convenient for parallelization , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "standard methods ( including the so - called block methods ) constructed in the framework of the traditional mathematics can be extended to universal algorithms over semirings ( the correspondence principle ! ) .",
    "for example , formula   discussed in subsection  [ ss : matrices ] leads to a simple block method for parallelization of the closure operations .",
    "other standard methods of linear algebra  @xcite can be used in a similar way .",
    "of course , the idempotent correspondence principle is valid for algorithms as well as for their software and hardware implementations  @xcite .",
    "thus :    _ if we have an important and interesting numerical algorithm , then there is a good chance that its semiring analogs are important and interesting as well . _    in particular",
    ", according to the superposition principle , analogs of linear algebra algorithms are especially important .",
    "note that numerical algorithms for standard infinite - dimensional linear problems over idempotent semirings ( i.e. , for problems related to idempotent integration , integral operators and transformations , the hamilton - jacobi and generalized bellman equations ) deal with the corresponding finite - dimensional ( or finite ) `` linear approximations '' .",
    "nonlinear algorithms often can be approximated by linear ones .",
    "thus the idempotent linear algebra is a basis for the idempotent numerical analysis .",
    "moreover , it is well - known that linear algebra algorithms easily lend themselves to parallel computation ; their idempotent analogs admit parallelization as well .",
    "thus we obtain a systematic way of applying parallel computing to optimization problems .",
    "basic algorithms of linear algebra ( such as inner product of two vectors , matrix addition and multiplication , etc . )",
    "often do not depend on concrete semirings , as well as on the nature of domains containing the elements of vectors and matrices .",
    "algorithms to construct the closure @xmath825 of an idempotent matrix @xmath272 can be derived from standard methods for calculating @xmath753 .",
    "for the gauss ",
    "jordan elimination method ( via lu - decomposition ) this trick was used in  @xcite , and the corresponding algorithm is universal and can be applied both to the bellman equation and to computing the inverse of a real ( or complex ) matrix @xmath826 .",
    "computation of @xmath827 can be derived from this universal algorithm with some obvious cosmetic transformations .",
    "thus it seems reasonable to develop universal algorithms that can deal equally well with initial data of different domains sharing the same basic structure  @xcite .",
    "a systematic application of the correspondence principle to computer calculations leads to a unifying approach to software and hardware design .",
    "the most important and standard numerical algorithms have many hardware realizations in the form of technical devices or special processors . _",
    "these devices often can be used as prototypes for new hardware units generated by substitution of the usual arithmetic operations for its semiring analogs and by addition tools for performing neutral elements @xmath49 and _ @xmath45 ( the latter usually is not difficult ) .",
    "of course , the case of numerical semirings consisting of real numbers ( maybe except neutral elements ) and semirings of numerical intervals is the most simple and natural @xcite .",
    "note that for semifields ( including @xmath62 and @xmath74 ) the operation of division is also defined .",
    "good and efficient technical ideas and decisions can be transferred from prototypes to new hardware units .",
    "thus the correspondence principle generated a regular heuristic method for hardware design .",
    "note that to get a patent it is necessary to present the so - called ` invention formula ' , that is to indicate a prototype for the suggested device and the difference between these devices .    consider ( as a typical example ) the most popular and important algorithm of computing the scalar product of two vectors : @xmath828 the universal version of   for any semiring @xmath272 is obvious : @xmath829 in the case @xmath830 this formula turns into the following one : @xmath831    this calculation is standard for many optimization algorithms , so it is useful to construct a hardware unit for computing  .",
    "there are many different devices ( and patents ) for computing   and every such device can be used as a prototype to construct a new device for computing   and even  .",
    "many processors for matrix multiplication and for other algorithms of linear algebra are based on computing scalar products and on the corresponding `` elementary '' devices respectively , etc .",
    "there are some methods to make these new devices more universal than their prototypes .",
    "there is a modest collection of possible operations for standard numerical semirings : max , min , and the usual arithmetic operations .",
    "so , it is easy to construct programmable hardware processors with variable basic operations .",
    "using modern technologies it is possible to construct cheap special - purpose multi - processor chips implementing examined algorithms .",
    "the so - called systolic processors are especially convenient for this purpose .",
    "a systolic array is a ` homogeneous ' computing medium consisting of elementary processors , where the general scheme and processor connections are simple and regular .",
    "every elementary processor pumps data in and out performing elementary operations in a such way that the corresponding data flow is kept up in the computing medium ; there is an analogy with the blood circulation and this is a reason for the term `` systolic '' , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "some systolic processors for the general algebraic path problem are presented in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , there is a systolic array of @xmath832 elementary processors which performs computations of the gauss ",
    "jordan elimination algorithm and can solve the algebraic path problem within @xmath833 time steps . of course , hardware implementations for important and popular basic algorithms increase the speed of data processing .",
    "the so - called gpgpu ( general - purpose computing on graphics processing units ) technique is another important field for applications of the correspondence principle .",
    "the matter is that graphic processing units ( hidden in modern laptop and desktop computers ) are potentially powerful processors for solving numerical problems .",
    "the recent tremendous progress in graphical processing hardware and software resulted in new `` open '' programmable parallel computational devices ( special processors ) , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "these devices are going to be standard for coming pc ( personal computers ) generations .",
    "initially used for graphical processing only ( at that time they were called gpu ) , today they are used for various fields , including audio and video processing , computer simulation , and encryption .",
    "but this list can be considerably enlarged following the correspondence principle : the basic operations would be used as parameters . using the technique described in this paper",
    "( see also our references ) , standard linear algebra algorithms can be used for solving different problems in different areas .",
    "in fact , the hardware supports all operations needed for the most important idempotent semirings : plus , times , min , max .",
    "the most popular linear algebra packages [ atlas ( automatically tuned linear algebra software ) , lapack , plasma ( parallel linear algebra for scalable multicore architectures ) ] can already use gpgpu , see @xcite .",
    "we propose to make these tools more powerful by using parameterized algorithms .",
    "linear algebra over the most important numerical semirings generates solutions for many concrete problems in different areas , see above .",
    "note that to be consistent with operations we have to redefine zero ( 0 ) and unit ( 1 ) elements ( see above ) ; comparison operations must be also redefined as it is described above .",
    "once the operations are redefined , then the most of basic linear algebra algorithms , including back and forward substitution , gauss elimination method , jordan elimination method and others could be rewritten for new domains and data structures .",
    "combined with the power of the new parallel hardware this approach could change pc from entertainment devices to power full instruments .",
    "software implementations for universal semiring algorithms are not as efficient as hardware ones ( with respect to the computation speed ) but they are much more flexible .",
    "program modules can deal with abstract ( and variable ) operations and data types .",
    "these operations and data types can be defined by the corresponding input data . in this case",
    "they can be generated by means of additional program modules . for programs written in this manner",
    "it is convenient to use special techniques of the so - called object oriented ( and functional ) design , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "fortunately , powerful tools supporting the object - oriented software design have recently appeared including compilers for real and convenient programming languages ( e.g. @xmath834 and java ) and modern computer algebra systems .",
    "recently , this type of programming technique has been dubbed generic programming ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . to help automate",
    "the generic programming , the so - called standard template library ( stl ) was developed in the framework of @xmath834  @xcite .",
    "however , high - level tools , such as stl , possess both obvious advantages and some disadvantages and must be used with caution .",
    "it seems that it is natural to obtain an implementation of the correspondence principle approach to scientific calculations in the form of a powerful software system based on a collection of universal algorithms .",
    "this approach ensures a working time reduction for programmers and users because of the software unification . the arbitrary necessary accuracy and safety of numeric calculations",
    "can be ensured as well .",
    "this software system may be especially useful for designers of algorithms , software engineers , students and mathematicians .",
    "note that there are some software systems oriented to calculations with idempotent semirings like @xmath62 ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "however these systems do not support universal algorithms .",
    "traditional interval analysis is a nontrivial and popular mathematical area , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "an `` idempotent '' version of interval analysis ( and moreover interval analysis over positive semirings ) appeared in  @xcite . later",
    "the idempotent interval analysis has attracted many experts in tropical linear algebra and applications , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "we also mention the closely related interval analysis over the positive semiring @xmath835 discussed in  @xcite .",
    "let a set  @xmath32 be partially ordered by a relation @xmath46 .",
    "a _ closed interval _ in  @xmath32 is a subset of the form @xmath836 = \\{\\ , x \\in s \\mid { \\underline{{\\mathbf x}}}\\preceq x \\preceq { \\overline{{\\mathbf x}}}\\ , \\}$ ] , where the elements @xmath837 are called _ lower _ and _ upper bounds _ of the interval @xmath838 .",
    "the order  @xmath46 induces a partial ordering on the set of all closed intervals in  @xmath32 : @xmath839 iff @xmath840 and @xmath841 .    a _ weak interval extension _ @xmath842 of an ordered semiring",
    "@xmath32 is the set of all closed intervals in  @xmath32 endowed with operations @xmath33 and  @xmath24 defined as @xmath843 $ ] , @xmath844 $ ] and a partial order induced by the order in @xmath32 .",
    "the closure operation in @xmath842 is defined by @xmath845 $ ] .",
    "there are some other interval extensions ( including the so - called strong interval extension  @xcite ) but the weak extension is more convenient .",
    "the extension @xmath842 is idempotent if @xmath32 is an idempotent semiring .",
    "a universal algorithm over @xmath32 can be applied to @xmath842 and we shall get an interval version of the initial algorithm . usually both the versions have the same complexity . for the discrete stationary bellman equation and the corresponding optimization problems on graphs ,",
    "interval analysis was examined in  @xcite in details .",
    "other problems of idempotent linear algebra were examined in  @xcite .",
    "idempotent mathematics appears to be remarkably simpler than its traditional analog .",
    "for example , in traditional interval arithmetic , multiplication of intervals is not distributive with respect to addition of intervals , whereas in idempotent interval arithmetic this distributivity is preserved .",
    "moreover , in traditional interval analysis the set of all square interval matrices of a given order does not form even a semigroup with respect to matrix multiplication : this operation is not associative since distributivity is lost in the traditional interval arithmetic . on the contrary , in the idempotent ( and positive ) case associativity is preserved . finally , in traditional interval analysis some problems of linear algebra , such as solution of a linear system of interval equations , can be very difficult ( more precisely , they are @xmath846-hard , see   @xcite and references therein ) . it was noticed in  @xcite that in the idempotent case solving an interval linear system requires a polynomial number of operations ( similarly to the usual gauss elimination algorithm ) .",
    "the remarkable simplicity of idempotent interval arithmetic is due to the following properties : the monotonicity of arithmetic operations and the positivity of all elements of an idempotent semiring .",
    "interval estimates in idempotent mathematics are usually exact . in the traditional theory",
    "such estimates tend to be overly pessimistic .",
