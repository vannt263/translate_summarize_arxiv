    "the set @xmath149 has two boundaries which are tangent to the null plane @xmath151 , and whose radius of curvature at the point of contact with the plane must be sufficiently large so that the causal futures and pasts of the points lying in the @xmath40 axis can intersect it only after one complete loop ( i.e. the timelike curves issuing from a point on the @xmath40 axis can intersect @xmath149 only from the second intersection with the plane @xmath152 ) .",

    "an analogous set @xmath157 ( where the minus sign denotes that the intersection of the causal curves is with the surface @xmath158 ) and past versions can be defined .",
    "the point here is that the first terms of this taylor expansion are quadratic and the coefficient decreases with the distance of @xmath66 from the surface .",
    "the idea is to remove inside @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 suitable sets passing through @xmath163 and @xmath164 so that  @xmath165 and @xmath166 \" would still hold as the future ( resp .",

    "the sets to be removed will be called ` filters ' and have an elliptical shape in the figure .",
    "the filters are chosen so that @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the only two points with the same past and future .",
    "let us focus on @xmath159 .",
    "if its boundary has taylor expansion @xmath167 , choose the set to be removed so that its boundary has taylor expansion @xmath168 .",
    "now , what happens is that chosen @xmath169 between @xmath82 and @xmath164 , since @xmath170 , there is a @xmath171 such that the points in @xmath172 with @xmath173 belong to the removed set . in other words , the causal curves issued from @xmath169",
    "may ` pass ' the filter",

    "thus the spacetime is distinguishing and using again the assumed reflectivity the causal continuity follows .",

    "actually , this example is also non - total imprisoning .",
    "i shall prove in a related work @xcite that feeble distinction implies non - total imprisonment which implies causality .",

    "i will show in a related work @xcite that the non - total imprisonment property stays between feeble distinction and causality , and figure [ wdis](a ) proves that in the definition of causal continuity , feeble distinction can not be replaced by non - total imprisonment . in this sense",
