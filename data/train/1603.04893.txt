    "a variety of interesting practical problems can be posed as utility maximization problems : these include facility location ( e.g. , @xcite ) , traffic routing and congestion management ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , sensor selection ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , and network resource allocation ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) . in a utility maximization problem , a set of users",
    "make decisions according to their own set of feasible strategies , resulting in an overall social utility value , such as profit , coverage , achieved data rate , and quality of service .",
    "the goal is to maximize the social utility function .",
    "often , the users do not cooperate in selecting their strategies .    in general , it is impractical to find the globally optimal sequence ( finite , ordered collection ) of strategies maximizing the social utility function . typically , it is more useful to consider scenarios where individual users or groups of users separately maximize their own _",
    "private _ objective functions , and then ask how this compares with the globally optimal case .",
    "the usual framework for studying such scenarios is game theory together with its celebrated notion of nash equilibria .",
    "nash equilibrium _ is a sequence of strategies ( deterministic or randomized ) for which no user can improve its own private utility by changing its strategy unilaterally .",
    "nash @xcite proves that any finite and noncooperative game has at least one nash equilibrium .",
    "the question of how the nash solution compares with the globally optimal solution has received some attention in the literature .",
    "notable results have been reported by @xcite and @xcite in the context of traffic routing and congestion management , which aims to minimize the total latency . for a general utility maximization problem ,",
    "vetta  @xcite develops lower bounds on the worst - case social utility value in noncooperative games .",
    "specifically , he proves that for a _",
    "submodular _ social utility function in a _",
    "valid _ utility system , any nash equilibrium achieves at least @xmath0 of the optimal social utility value , subject to a function - dependent additive term .",
    "he also shows that for a nondecreasing and submodular social utility function in a valid utility system , any nash equilibrium can achieve at least @xmath1 of the optimal social utility function value , where @xmath8 is the _ curvature _ of the social utility function .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in exploring bounds when there is some notion of `` grouping '' among users . along these lines ,",
    "we consider two notions of grouping that yield to provable performance bounds .",
    "the first type of grouping we consider is the recent framework of chen et al .",
    "@xcite , where associated with each user is a private objective function and a fixed group of users having some social ties with it .",
    "each user s strategy maximizes an objective function called the _ social group utility _ , which is the sum of its private objective function and a linear combination of the private objective functions of users in its group . within this setting , chen et al .",

    ", where no user can improve its social group utility by unilaterally changing its strategy . we will show that this framework yields to the bounding results of vetta  @xcite for noncoperative games , thus establishing provable performance guarantees for the framework of @xcite .    in the second type of grouping we consider",
    ", the set of users is partitioned into disjoint groups . associated with each group",
    "is a group utility function .",
    "users within a group _ cooperate _ in the sense that their strategy is to ( jointly ) maximize the group utility function , giving rise to a natural definition of _ group nash equilibrium_. this case does not yield to the results of @xcite . nonetheless , we show that for this case a similar bound holds . moreover",
    ", we define a measure of curvature and derive an associated lower bound involving this curvature .",
    "this bound is tighter than that for the case where there is no grouping among users , accounting for the cooperation within the groups .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  ii ,",
    "we introduce our notation and some definitions that will be used throughout the paper . in section  iii , we review the bounding results of @xcite .",
    "we first describe the framework of @xcite and show that , given submodularity and validity , any social - aware nash equilibrium achieves at least @xmath0 of the optimal social utility , subject to a function - dependent additive term .",
    "we further prove that if the social utility function is nondecreasing and submodular , then any social - aware nash equilibrium achieves at least @xmath1 of the optimal social utility , where @xmath2 is the curvature of the social utility function .",

    "we show that , given submodularity and validity , any group nash equilibrium achieves at least @xmath0 of the optimal social utility , subject to a function - dependent additive term .",
