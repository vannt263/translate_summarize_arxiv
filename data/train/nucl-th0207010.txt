    "although quantum field theory has succeeded greatly in the scope of particle physics , people have met some difficulties when the methods of the quantum field theory are applied to nuclear systems .",
    "the ground state of the nuclear system is filled with interacting nucleons , which is different from the vacuum in perturbation theory .",
    "in addition , the coupling constants of strong interaction between nucleons are far larger than the fine structure constant in the quantum electrodynamics , so the perturbation method could not be performed perfectly on nuclear systems . at last , the nucleons and mesons consist of quarks and gluons , and are not fundamental components in the level of modern knowledge .",
    "all these factors determine the perturbation method in quantum field theory can only be generalized to solve nuclear many - body problems approximately and effectively .",
    "walecka and his group attempted to solve the nuclear many - body problems in the framework of quantum field theory , and developed the method of relativistic mean - field approximation @xcite . in this method , the field operators of the scalar meson and vector meson are replaced with their expectation values in the nuclear matter , respectively .",
    "therefore , the calculation is simplified largely . until now",
    ", there have been some excellent review articles giving a more detailed description on this topic@xcite . in the earliest relativistic mean - field theory ,",

    "the relativistic mean - field equations are solved and the corresponding coupling constants are fixed to the results of brueckner calculation . therefore , a relativistic mean - field model with density - dependent coupling constants is obtained@xcite .",

    ", the screening meson masses increase with the density of the nuclear matter , and it is equivalent to the statement that the coupling constants decrease with the density increasing while the masses of mesons retain constant . at this point , these two models are consistent with each other .    in the past decade , the relativistic mean - field theory has been extended in various directions to provide a more realistic description of nuclei .",
