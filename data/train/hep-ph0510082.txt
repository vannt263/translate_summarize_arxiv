    "<S> we consider a search for the cp - violating angle @xmath0 in long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments . we show that the subleading @xmath0-dependent terms in the @xmath1 oscillation probability can be easily obscured by the ambiguity of the leading term which depends on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus necessary to determine the value of @xmath3 with a sufficient accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 survival events , which can be accumulated simultaneously with the @xmath5 appearance events , can serve for this purpose owing to its large statistics . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the combined analysis of @xmath5 appearance and @xmath4 survival events is crucial to provide a restrictive constraint on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> taking a test experimental setup , we demonstrate in the @xmath0-@xmath3 plane that the analysis of @xmath5 appearance events leads to less restrictive constraints on the value of @xmath0 due to the ambiguity of @xmath3 and that the combined analysis efficiently improves the constraints . </S>"
