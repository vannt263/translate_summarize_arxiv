    "this article is divided in two parts . in the first one , we present two variational formulae which extend to non - selfadjoint elliptic operators the classical dirichlet and thomson principle . in the second one",
    ", we use these formulae to describe the metastable behavior of a non - reversible diffusion process in a double - well potential field .    fix a smooth , bounded , domain ( open and connected ) @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and a smooth function @xmath2 .",
    "denote by @xmath3 the set of functions @xmath4 such that @xmath5 on @xmath6 , the boundary of @xmath7 .",
    "the classical dirichlet principle @xcite states that the energy @xmath8 is minimized on @xmath3 by the harmonic function on @xmath7 which takes the value @xmath9 at the boundary , that is , by the solution of @xmath10    when @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are smooth domains , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 on @xmath15 , @xmath16 , respectively , the minimal energy is called the capacity . in electrostatics",
    ", it corresponds to the total electric charge on the conductor @xmath17 held at unit potential and grounded at @xmath16 .",
    "it is denoted by @xmath18 and can be represented , by the divergence theorem , as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the harmonic function which solves , @xmath21 is the outward normal vector to @xmath17 , and @xmath22 the surface measure at @xmath17 .",
    "these results have long been established for self - adjoint operators of the form @xmath23 $ ] , provided @xmath24 are smooth , positive - definite , symmetric matrices , and @xmath25 is a smooth potential .",
    "they have been extended , more recently , by pinsky @xcite to the case in which the operator @xmath26 is not self - adjoint .",
    "in this situation , the minimization formula for the capacity , mentioned above , has to be replaced by a minmax problem .    the first main result of this article provides two variational formulae for the capacity in terms of divergence - free flows .",
    "in contrast with the minmax formulae , the first optimization problem is expressed as an infimum , while the second one is expressed as a supremum , simplifying the task of obtaining lower and upper bounds for the capacity .",
    "analogous dirichlet and thomson principle were obtained by gaudillire and landim @xcite ( the dirichlet principle ) and by slowik @xcite ( the thomson principle ) for continuous - time markov chains .    in the second part of the article",
    ", we use the formulae for the capacity to examine the metastable behavior of a non - reversible diffusion in a double well potential .",

    "if @xmath45 starts from a neighborhood of @xmath40 , it remains there for a long time in the small noise limit @xmath46 until it overcomes the potential barrier and jumps to a neighborhood of @xmath41 through the saddle point @xmath42 .",
    "denote by @xmath47 the hitting time of a neighborhood of @xmath41 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the mean value of @xmath47 as @xmath46 has been the object of many studies .",
    "the arrhenius law @xcite asserts that the mean value is logarithmic equivalent to the potential barrier : @xmath48 = u({{\\boldsymbol \\sigma } } ) - u({{\\boldsymbol m}}_1 ) = : \\delta u$ ] , where @xmath49 represents the expectation of the diffusion @xmath32 starting from @xmath40 .",
    "the sub - exponential corrections , known as the eyring - kramers formula @xcite , have been computed when the matrix @xmath28 is symmetric and the potential non - degenerate at the critical points .",
    "assuming that the hessian of the potential is positive definite at @xmath40 and that it has a unique negative eigenvalue at @xmath42 , denoted by @xmath50 , while all the others are strictly positive , the sub - exponential prefactor is given by @xmath51\\;=\\ ; \\left[1+o_{\\epsilon}(1)\\right]\\ , \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda }   \\,\\frac{\\sqrt{-\\det\\left[(\\text{hess } u ) \\ , ( { { \\boldsymbol \\sigma}})\\right ] } } { \\sqrt{\\det\\left[(\\text{\\rm hess } u)\\ , ( { { \\boldsymbol m}}_{1})\\right]}}\\,\\ ,   e^{\\delta u/\\epsilon}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 as @xmath53 vanishes .",

    "recentlty , bouchet and reygner @xcite extended the eyring - kramers formula to the non - reversible setting .",
    "they showed that in this context the negative eigenvalue @xmath50 has to be replaced by the unique negative eigenvalue of @xmath54 .",
    "we present below a rigorous proof of this result , based on the variational formulae obtained for the capacity in the first part of the article , and on the approach developed by bovier , eckhoff , gayrard , and klein @xcite in the reversible case .",
