    "lastly , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we briefly summarize our results and state our conclusions .",
    "we study the formation and evolution of vortices in the outer edge of planetary gaps by solving numerically the following system of hydrodynamical ( hd ) equations    align + ( ) = 0 , [ eq : hdsigma ] & + + = - - _ g , [ eq : hdv ] & + + p + c_s^2 = 0 , [ eq : hdp ] &    where @xmath5 is the gas surface density , @xmath6 is the velocity , @xmath7 is the vertically integrated pressure , @xmath8 is the gravitational potential , and @xmath9 is the sound speed . in order to close the system of equations , we used an ideal equation of state @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "we considered an inviscid disk , thus no prescribed viscosity was included .",
    "this approximation may influence the vortex evolution , since previous works showed that the vortex lifetime is inversely proportional to the magnitude of viscosity @xcite . in this work",
    ", we would like to study the direct influence of the rwi and radial buoyancy for the development of the vortices .",
    "therefore we chose to not include a prescribed viscosity . in our models , the only possible source of viscosity is the turbulence - triggered viscosity by the hydrodynamical instabilities .",
    "lastly , we assumed that the barycenter of the system is located at the star s center .",
    "this simplification is plausible , because the planet masses considered are not very large ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) neither the vortices accumulate much mass , thus the deviation of the barycenter with respect to the star s",
    "center should be small .",
    "nonetheless , this approximation may slightly influence planet - induced vortex formation , since it eliminates the lagrange point l3 , in the corotation region , which could change the gap structure .",
    "we used the planet - disk module for the pluto code that is presented in @xcite .",
    "the gravitational potential includes contributions from the planet and the star , and it is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gravitational constant , @xmath16 is the planet mass , @xmath17 is the planet location , @xmath18 is the stellar mass and @xmath19 is a softening parameter .",
    "it is needed to soften the gravitational potential of the planet in order to avoid numerical divergence close to the planet s location . moreover , this softening can account for 3d effects of vertical stratification .",
    "we considered this parameter as being a fraction of the hill radius @xmath20 , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the recommended softening factor for the planet gravitational potential is of @xmath23 @xcite , where @xmath24 is the disk scale height .",
    "these values can recover 3d effects of vertical stratification .",
    "the hill radius and the disk scale height at the planet position are similar in our simulations , thus we chose @xmath25 .",

    "we modeled this cooling via thermal relaxation , following the approach below @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the temperature , @xmath45 is the initial temperature ( equilibrium temperature as result of irradiation ) , and @xmath46 is the relaxation timescale , which depends on radius ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this approach tends to reestablish the equilibrium temperature profile , after the planetary gap is opened and the system reaches a steady state .    instead of adding cooling as a source term in the energy equation , we updated the temperature at each time step according to equation [ eq : tr ]",
    ". numerically it corresponds to @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the relaxed temperature , @xmath50 would be the temperature we get from the solution of the energy equation , and @xmath51 is the time step .",

    "the color bar was truncated from @xmath110 to @xmath111 , in order to provide a higher contrast . ]",
    "this result demonstrates that when we have the rwi and buoyancy acting at the same time , weaker vortices are produced .",
    "therefore , buoyancy opposes vortex amplification and survival , in this scenario .",
    "taking into account that these processes provide viscosity to the system , once we have both in action more viscosity is produced .",
    "more viscous disks carve out smoother gaps , leading to the weaker vortices .",
    "it should also be noticed that for @xmath95 , the secondary vortices get damped during the simulation interval , those are also the cases for which buoyancy plays some role for the secondary vortex evolution .",
    "in this section , we explore the numerical factors that could influence the physical validity of our simulations .",
    "the tests were done using the tr01 case as reference .",
    "the physical conditions and numerical setup were exactly the same as for tr01 , varying only what we following mention .",
    "we checked the convergence of the results considering a higher numerical resolution .",
    "we analyzed whether our reflecting boundary conditions for the radial direction may have reflected waves , influencing the evolution of the system .",
    "a different way to prevent boundary effects is to push the outer disk to a larger radius , hence we also used this approach to check whether the disk size influenced the results .",
    "lastly , we added the planet along a larger number of planetary orbits to analyse whether the initial planet disturbance could have been too large , generating fake effects .    for the numerical resolution test ,",
    "we doubled the resolution from ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 )  =  ( 512 , 1024 ) to ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 )  =  ( 1024 , 2048 ) . the temporal evolution was taken up to 1000 planetary orbits .",
    "the full temporal evolution was not checked , because the doubled resolution is numerically highly expensive .",
    "for the boundary conditions test , we first changed the inner and outer radial boundary conditions from reflective to non - reflective , second we considered a larger disk extending from 0.25  au to 8  au .",
    "finally , aiming to check the effect of the initial planet disturbance to the disk , we made two tests : slowly adding the planet along its first 10 and 100 orbits , following equation [ eq : mp ] , in the reference case the planet was slowly added along its first orbit .",
    "the temporal evolution for the last four tests was taken up to 5000 planetary orbits .",
    "we compare our test cases with the reference case using their surface density profiles at the latest snapshot .",
    "figure [ fig : code_check ] presents these profiles for @xmath112  orbits ( numerical resolution comparison ) and @xmath113  orbits ( other comparisons ) .",
    "we observed a good agreement for the surface density profiles , indicating that the simulation results were not much influenced by these factors .",
    "nonetheless , for the resolution test , the outer gradient that leads to the second generation of vortices is slightly smoother than for the standard case .",
    "for the boundary condition test , in the outer disk ( @xmath114  au ) the material is emptied out , due to the boundary choice ; however , the main results agree with the standard case .",
    "the major difference is regarding the secondary vortex , for the standard case a secondary merged vortex is created , in this case two secondary vortices are created and they do not merge until the end of the simulation .",
    "the two secondary vortices , for the non - reflecting radial boundaries , are right opposite to each other in the azimuthal direction and they have about the same strength .",
    "we speculate that the flow in the corotation region of these vortices is not being able to push them together , exactly because the vortices have same strength and are located right opposite to each other , leading to a stable configuration",
    ". for the larger disk size , the standing difference is regarding the local minimum between the surface density bumps , where the primary and secondary vortices sit .",
    "for the standard case , the local minimum is still present by the end of the simulation . for the larger disk size",
    ", this local minimum has disappeared by the end of the simulation , meaning that the matter is dissipating slightly faster .    for the planet",
    "being added along the first 10 orbits , the primary small vortices merge in a faster timescale , and the vortices amplitudes take a longer time to grow than for the standard case . for the planet",
    "being added along the first 100 orbits , the vortices amplitudes take also a longer time to grow than for the standard case .",
    "higher planet masses can excite stronger vortices @xcite , thus when the planet perturbation is added slower , the vortices will also take a longer time to grow .",
    "orbits ( top panel ) and @xmath68  orbits ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the top panel presents the comparison for the numerical resolution test .",
    "the red solid line shows the reference case , whereas the slate blue dotted - dashed line the numerical resolution test .",
    "the bottom panel presents the comparison for the other cases .",
    "the red solid line shows the reference case , the goldenrod dotted line shows the boundary conditions test , the green dashed line shows the disk size test , the slate blue dotted - dashed line shows the planet disturbance test ( the planet was added during its first 10 orbits ) , and the violet triple - dotted - dashed line shows the planet disturbance test ( the planet was added during its first 100 orbits ) . ]",
    "the most interesting result of our simulations is the second generation of vortices .",
    "a surface density enhancement was observed beyond the primary vortex position for all the cases .",
    "this bump is strong enough to trigger the rwi outside the primary vortex radius and to form a second generation of vortices .",
    "as it was discussed before , we observe a minimum for @xmath76 in the region of the secondary vortex for all the cases . also , there are strips of negative @xmath86 in the region of the secondary vortex , with exception for the tr001 and the isothermal cases .",
    "once more , the action of the rwi together with buoyancy controls the vortex evolution . for the tr001 and isothermal cases ,",
    "the rwi is solely responsible for the secondary vortex .",
    "we already established that our results were not affected by the choice of boundary conditions , resolution , or the planet perturbation being too sharp .",
    "therefore , it confirms the physical origin of the second generation of vortices . no further density enhancement ( strong enough to keep triggering the rwi ) beyond the secondary vortex position",
    "was observed , even for the test simulation with a larger disk , thus we do not expect a third generation of vortices .",
    "accumulation of mass is observed at the inner boundary for all the cases .",
    "our understanding is that the primary vortices produce an effective @xmath0-viscosity that is large enough to induce accretion in the disk in the timescales we simulate .",
    "therefore mass is flowing from the region of the primary vortex to the inner disk .",
    "the depletion of mass in the orbit of the primary vortex position looks like a gap carved out by the primary vortex .",
    "in fact , the outer wall of the planetary gap is moving outwards due to this depletion of mass .",
    "for instance , for the iso3mj case , by the end of our simulation all the mass in the orbit of the primary vortex was already depleted and the planetary gap became wider in its outer side .",
    "figure [ fig : inmass ] presents the inner disk mass as a function of time for simulation tr01 , where the increase of the mass is demonstrated .     as the inner disk . ]",
    "the faster mass increase happens in the first tens of orbits , when the planet still carving out its gap . during this period , the mass increase is mostly due to the planetary gap opening process .",
    "the inner disk mass is being pushed from @xmath115  au to the inner parts of the disk . for @xmath116  orbits ,",
    "the mass increase is most likely due to accretion induced by the primary vortex .",
    "our simulations assumed an inviscid disk , therefore any viscosity is produced by the hydrodynamical instabilities , which in this case could be named a vortex - induced viscosity .",
    "we can obtain an estimate of the @xmath0-parameter , using the @xmath117 component of the reynolds stress and the local sound speed @xcite .",
    "for simulation tr01 , the @xmath0-parameter averaged in space and time ( until the time the secondary vortex appears ) was @xmath118 , a value in the range of what is typically obtained by the mri , @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "the other simulations presented values in the range from @xmath119 , in agreement with mri .",
    "the lowest value obtained was @xmath120 , for tr1 , and the highest value was @xmath121 , for tr5 .",
    "large - scale vortices are able to transport angular momentum outwards , because a negative angular momentum flux is obtained from the balance between the angular momentum carried by rossby waves in the inner and outer sides of a surface density bump @xcite .    in this work we assumed that the barycenter of the system is located at the star s center .",
    "this approximation could influence the gap structure , since the lagrange point l3 , in the corotation region of the planet , is removed .",
    "changes in the gap structure may affect the primary vortex generation , subsequently possibly impacting the second generation of vortices .",
    "this assumption summed to the inviscid disk approach are two factors that could influence the formation of a second generation of vortices .",
    "we suggest that further studies should check these factors .",
    "vortices are able to trap dust particles , because they are local pressure bumps .",
    "the particles are attracted to the highest pressure region , thus to the vortex center .",
    "the secondary vortex becomes extensively spread in the azimuthal direction for @xmath95 and @xmath122 . in order to make sure that these nonaxisymmetric structures can still trap dust particles",
    ", we checked their pressure profiles .",
    "figure [ fig : pressure ] shows a radial cut of the pressure for @xmath123 equals to the vortex center and an azimuthal cut of the pressure for @xmath124 equals to the vortex center .",
    "we show the cases of @xmath125 and @xmath122 , since these are the simulations that present the most spread vortices in the azimuthal direction .",
    "we can observe a pressure bump in both radial and azimuthal directions ; however , in the azimuthal direction the bump of iso3mj is very smooth .",
    "@xcite showed that a very smooth pressure bump in the azimuthal direction is still sufficient to trap mm and cm particles in the vortex center .",
    "therefore the secondary vortices should be able to trap dust particles , leading to an asymmetric global dust distribution .",
    "the top panel shows a cut of the pressure for @xmath123 equals to the secondary vortex center .",
    "the bottom panel shows a cut of the pressure for @xmath124 equals to the secondary vortex center .",
    "the red solid line represents simulation tr10 , whereas the slate blue dotted - dashed line represents simulation iso3mj .",
    "]      the system oph irs 48 is a good candidate to host a vortex - like structure induced by a planet @xcite .",
    "the continuum emission alma observations at @xmath126  mm revealed a high - contrast asymmetry in the disk of this system , which was interpreted as existing due to the presence of an anticyclonic vortex @xcite .",
    "besides , this system shows a central cavity in co line observations , which was explained as a gap opened by a massive planet @xcite .",
    "@xcite ran a fargo simulation considering the parameters of this system to get the gas density distribution . later on the result from the hd simulation was used as the initial condition in a dust evolution code to get the expected continuum emission .",
    "they were able to roughly reproduce the alma observation ; however , there is a debate regarding the location of the vortex .",
    "if the planet is located at @xmath127  au , the vortex is expected to be located at most at @xmath128  au , nonetheless it is located at @xmath129  au .",
    "we run a simulation using the same setup as @xcite , with the difference that here no viscosity was included , but instead we used thermal relaxation , and initialized the disk with @xmath130 constant .",

    "the disk considered was much larger ( from @xmath132 to @xmath133  au ) than the one of our benchmark cases ( from @xmath134 to @xmath135  au ) , therefore the resolution may not have been sufficient to solve the secondary vortex .",
    "figure [ fig : ophirs48 ] shows the potential vorticity for this simulation after @xmath136 planetary orbits .",
    "we can see that @xmath76 is negative around @xmath137  au , therefore a secondary vortex could be formed in that region .",

    "the ratio between the positions of the secondary and primary vortices in our benchmark cases is about @xmath140 .",
    "if this ratio is fixed , the second generation of vortices in the oph irs 48 system would be located at @xmath141  au . in order to check whether the secondary vortex was not observed due to a numerical resolution problem , we run a second simulation considering the same planet - disk setup as before , but integrating over a smaller disk size .",
    "we fixed the inner and outer disk radius , in order to maintain the same ratio between the planet orbital distance and the boundaries as for the benchmark cases .",
    "the new simulation has a disk ranging from @xmath142  au to @xmath143  au .",
    "figure [ fig : ophirs48b ] shows the potential vorticity for the smaller disk size after @xmath136 planetary orbits .",
    "here , we can see the formation of a secondary vortex , located at @xmath144  au , indicating that in the previous case the numerical resolution was indeed not sufficient .",
    "this new result is a promising explanation for the location of the oph irs 48 s vortex , assuming a single planet at @xmath145  au distance from the star .",
    "it is also important to mention that at @xmath136 planetary orbits , the primary and secondary vortices are present .",
    "the benchmark cases show that the primary vortex get damped before the secondary one , thus for later times",
    ", just the secondary vortex may be present .    orbits .",
    "the color bar was truncated from @xmath138 to @xmath139 in order to obtain a higher contrast . ]",
    "in this section we obtain the primary vortex lifetime and secondary vortex birth time as a function of the thermal relaxation timescale . for this purpose , we first had to define when the vortex is born .",
    "once an overdensity with negative potential vorticity arises , we declare that this overdensity is a vortex .",
    "we define as overdensity a region that possesses an average surface density at least @xmath146 higher than the average background surface density .",
    "the center of the vortex was defined as the position of the maximum surface density .",
    "we determined the vortex edge by looking to the position where the potential vorticity drops to @xmath147 below its value at the vortex center .",
    "this procedure was done in both radial and azimuthal directions . knowing the dimensions of the vortex",
    ", we could calculate the average surface density and potential vorticity inside the vortex .",
    "the procedure of finding the vortex and defining its border was done until the time that the vortex can not be defined as an overdensity anymore .",
    "once this criterion was reached we defined the vortex as dead . in this way",
    ", the vortex lifetime was defined as the difference between the time it is born and the time it dies .",
    "figure [ fig : tauvstime ] presents the primary vortex lifetime as a function of the different thermal relaxation timescales .",
    "we observe a nonmonotonic behavior that was already seen by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite explained that the nonmonotonic behavior is due to the fact that the vortex lifetime depends on ( i ) the decay timescale of the rwi , which decreases for increasing @xmath67 , and ( ii ) the vortex growth time , which increases for values of @xmath67 up to @xmath148 and then decreases for larger values .",
    "the nonmonotonic nature is a result of this double dependence .",
    "the double peak , featuring at small @xmath67 s and @xmath149 , is due to the nonmonotonic behavior of the vortex growth time for different @xmath67 s .",
    "higher disk temperatures favors the rwi @xcite , nevertheless this effect seems to be important just for larger @xmath67 s .",
    "the dependence of the vortex lifetime with the vortex growth time comes to the fact that once the vortex amplitude is very large , it begins to induce shocks , thus the vortex looses energy through shock dissipation and starts to decay .",
    "the inviscid approximation may have influenced the estimation of the vortex lifetimes , since it is inversely dependent on the viscosity magnitude @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that it did not influence the qualitatively behavior of vortex lifetimes as a function of thermal relaxation timescales , since our results are in agreement with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also plot in figure [ fig : tauvstime ] the time when the secondary vortex is born .",
    "a nonmonotonic behavior is also observed and the curves are shifted by a few hundreds of planetary orbits , with exception for @xmath125 . since the primary vortex is born in a scale of tens of planetary orbits , it is clear that the secondary vortex is always born before the death of the primary vortex , again with exception for @xmath150 . the time taken for the secondary vortex to be born is correlated to the time that the primary vortex needs to deplete the mass on its orbit .",
    "therefore it depends on the vortex growth time and the accretion rate generated by the primary vortex .",
    "this explains the inverse dependence of the secondary vortex birth time and primary vortex growth time as a function of the thermal relaxation time scale .",
    "vortices can be formed as a product of the rwi and/or radial buoyancy ( bi / sbi / co ) . the rwi can be triggered in the walls of a planetary gap due to a sharp surface density gradient .",
    "the disk is buoyantly unstable when the pressure and entropy gradients have the same sign , a thermal relaxation of the order of @xmath151 also favors vortex amplification .",
    "we carried out global 2d - hd simulations of planet - disk interactions , using the pluto code .",
    "the aim was to study the long - term evolution of planet - induced vortices in inviscid disks and initially buoyantly unstable , considering several thermal relaxation timescales .",
    "thermal relaxation is an important ingredient to sustain radial buoyancy @xcite .",
    "it has also a strong impact on amplifying and damping vortices .",
    "we found that radial buoyancy smoothen the surface density gradients in the wall of a planetary gap , which generates weaker vortices . in this particular physical scenario ,",
    "radial buoyancy operates against vortex amplification and survival .",
    "this effect is less pronounced for the isothermal and quasi - isothermal states ( @xmath152 ) , which is expected , since thermal relaxation is a required ingredient to sustain radial buoyancy .",
    "the qualitative system evolution is similar for different thermal relaxation timescales and different planet masses .",
    "the major difference is regarding the timescales of events ( e.g. , time required for vortex damping and mass transfer ) .",
    "the most interesting result from our simulations was the formation of a second generation of vortices .",
    "the primary vortex creates an effective @xmath0-viscosity that is large enough to induce accretion .",
    "we obtained @xmath0-values in the range @xmath153 , which agrees with what is obtained by the mri @xcite .",
    "the accretion process depletes the mass in the primary vortex orbit , creating a density enhancement outwards the vortex position .",
    "this bump is sufficient to trigger the rwi , leading to the secondary vortex formation .",
    "this result is a promising explanation for the location of the vortex in the oph irs 48 system @xcite , which is located at @xmath154  au .",
    "previous models predicted that the vortex location could be at most at @xmath155  au , assuming a single planet at @xmath145  au .",
    "our model suggests that a second generation of vortices can be formed at @xmath144  au , if a massive planet ( @xmath4 ) is assumed at @xmath127  au .",
    "we suggest that further works should test the formation of a second generation of vortices in non - inviscid disks and considering a proper treatment of the system s barycenter location , since these factors may influence the generation and sustenance of vortices .",
