    "holographic qcd has provided an insightful look to a number of issues in baryonic physics at strong coupling @xmath1 and large number of colors @xmath4  @xcite . in particular , in @xcite baryons are constructed from a five - dimensional shrodinger - like equation whereby the 5th dimension generates mass - like anomalous dimensions through pertinent boundary conditions .",
    "a number of baryonic properties have followed ranging from baryonic spectra to form factors @xcite .    at large @xmath4 baryons",
    "are chiral solitons in qcd .",
    "a particularly interesting framework for discussing this scenario is the d8-@xmath5 chiral holographic model recently suggested by sakai and sugimoto  @xcite ( herethrough hqcd ) . in hqcd d4",
    "static instantons in bulk source the chiral solitons or skyrmions on the boundary .",
    "the instantons have a size of order @xmath0 and a mass of order @xmath6 in units of @xmath7 , the kaluza - klein scale  @xcite .",
    "the static skyrmion is just the instanton holonomy in the @xmath8-direction , with a larger size of order @xmath9  @xcite .    in the past",
    "the skyrmion - skyrmion interaction was mostly analyzed using the product ansatz  @xcite or some variational techniques  @xcite .",
    "while the product ansatz reveals a pionic tail in the spin and tensor channels , it lacks the intermediate range attraction in the scalar channel expected from two - pion exchange .",
    "in fact the scalar potential to order @xmath4 is found to be mostly repulsive , and therefore unsuited for binding nuclear matter at large @xmath4 .",
    "the core part of the skyrmion - skyrmion interaction in the product of two skyrmions is ansatz dependent . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that the ansatz dependence could be eliminated in the two - pion range by adding the pion cloud to the core skyrmions . in a double expansion using large @xmath4 and the pion - range , a scalar attraction was shown to develop in the two - pion range in the scalar channel  @xcite .",
    "the expansion gets quickly involved while addressing shorter ranges or core interactions .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the two - baryon problem using the d4 two - instanton solution  @xcite to order @xmath2 .",
    "the ensuing skyrmion - skyrmion interaction is essentially that of the two cores and the meson cloud composed of ( massles ) pions and vector mesons . at strong coupling",
    ", holography fixes the core interactions in a way that the skyrme model does not .",
    "although in qcd very short ranged interactions are controlled by asymptotic freedom , the core interactions at intermediate distances maybe still in the realm of strong coupling and therefore unamenable to qcd perturbation theory . in this sense , holography will be helpful .",
    "also , in holographic qcd the mesonic cloud including pions and vectors is naturally added to the core skyrmions in the framework of semiclassics .",
    "these issues will be quantitatively addressed in this paper .    in section 2 ,",
    "we review the adhm construction for one and two - instanton following on recent work in  @xcite . in section 3 , we show how this construction translates to the one and two baryon configuration in holography . in section 4 , we construct the bare or core skyrmion - skyrmion interaction for defensive and combed skyrmions .",
    "we unwind the core skyrmion - skyrmion interaction at large separations in terms of a dominant coulomb repulsion in regular gauge .",
    "core issues related to the singular gauge are also discussed . in section 5 , we project the core skyrmion - skyrmion contributions onto the core nucleon - nucleon contributions at large separation using semiclassics in the adiabatic approximation . in section 6 , we include the effects of the mesonic cloud to order @xmath2 in the born - oppenheimer approximation . at large separations ,",
