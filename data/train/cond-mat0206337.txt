    "unlike in the case of the luttinger model , backscattering can not be taken into account by merely renormalizing the forward coupling constants .",
    "this is due to the one - branch structure of the present model , which generates one - particle potentials from the backward scattering when the latter is brought into the form of an effective forward scattering .",
