    "hermite polynomials @xmath1 are one of the most important families of orthogonal polynomials in mathematics , appearing in probability theory , mathematical physics , differential equations , combinatorics , etc .",
    "one of the simplest ways to construct them is through their generating function , @xmath2 on the other hand , chebyshev polynomials of the second kind @xmath3 are another important family of orthogonal polynomials ( appearing in numerical analysis , for example ) , with a generating function @xmath4 note that both of these functions have the form @xmath0 , with @xmath5 , respectively , @xmath6 .",
    "[ question : main ] what are all the orthogonal polynomials with generating functions of the form @xmath7 for some number @xmath8 and function ( or , more precisely , formal power series ) @xmath9 ?",
    "a reader interested in further context and background for this question may want to start by reading section  [ section : history ] .",
    "the following is the first fundamental theorem about orthogonal polynomials .",
    "let @xmath10 be a _",
    "monic orthogonal polynomial family_. that is ,    * each @xmath11 is a polynomial of degree exactly @xmath12 ( polynomial family ) . *",
    "each @xmath13 ( monic ) . * for some non - decreasing function @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and infinitely many points of increase ( equivalently , for some probability measure supported on infinitely many points ) the stieltjes integral @xmath17 for all @xmath18 ( orthogonal ) .",
    "then there exist real numbers @xmath19 and positive real numbers @xmath20 such that the polynomials satisfy a three - term recursion relation @xmath21 ( to make the formula work for @xmath22 , take @xmath23 ) .",
    "actually , favard s theorem also asserts that the converse to the statement above is true : if we have a monic polynomial family satisfying such a recursion , these polynomials are automatically orthogonal for some @xmath24 , and the case of @xmath14 with only finitely many points of increase can also be included .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  1 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  2 ) for the proof .",
    "we only need the `` easy '' direction stated above , which we now prove .",
    "every polynomial @xmath25 of degree @xmath26 is a linear combination of @xmath27 .",
    "therefore @xmath25 is orthogonal to all @xmath11 with @xmath28 . since @xmath29",
    "we can expand @xmath30 for some coefficients @xmath31 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath32 orthogonality implies @xmath33 since @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath14 has infinitely many points of increase , @xmath35 can not be zero at all of those points , and as a result @xmath36 therefore @xmath37 for @xmath32 , so in fact @xmath38 only . denoting @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    ", we get the formula .",
    "it remains to note that @xmath41 since both @xmath42 and @xmath43 are positive , so is @xmath40 .",
    "good references for polynomial families are wikipedia and @xcite .",
    "beware that in the following examples , we use for monic polynomials the notation which usually appears for other normalizations , so our formulas may differ from the references by a re - scaling .",
    "the orthogonality relation for the hermite polynomials is @xmath44 thus they are orthogonal with respect to the normal ( gaussian ) distribution .",

    "they satisfy a recursion @xmath49    the legendre polynomials are the family of orthogonal polynomials a student is most likely to encounter in an undergraduate course . in a linear algebra course , one sees them in the applications of the gram - schmidt formula , since their orthogonality relation is simply @xmath50 in a differential equations course , one sees them as a solution of the legendre equation .",
    "this equation , in turn , arises after the separation of variables in the heat equation or laplace s equation in three dimensions , or on a sphere .",
    "the recursion satisfied by the legendre polynomials is @xmath51    the ultraspherical ( also called gegenbauer ) polynomials @xmath52 are orthogonal with respect to @xmath53 ( with integration restricted to @xmath54 $ ] ) for @xmath55 .",
    "note that the legendre polynomials are a particular case corresponding to @xmath56 .",
    "just as the legendre polynomials are related to the sphere , the other ultraspherical families for half - integer @xmath57 are related to higher - dimensional spheres .",
    "they satisfy a recursion @xmath58 see section  1.8.1 of @xcite .",
    "another important special case are the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind @xmath59 , which correspond to @xmath60 and are orthogonal with respect to @xmath61 .    for @xmath62",
    ", the coefficient @xmath63 as written in formula   is undefined .",
    "the polynomials orthogonal with respect to @xmath64 are the chebyshev polynomials of the first kind @xmath65 , for which the recursion holds for @xmath66 ( with @xmath62 ) , but @xmath67    suppose @xmath68 form a monic orthogonal polynomial family , with orthogonality given by a function @xmath14 and the recursion @xmath69 then for @xmath70 , the polynomials @xmath71 are also monic , orthogonal with respect to @xmath72 , and satisfy @xmath73 indeed , from equation  , @xmath74 which implies the recursion for @xmath75 .",

    "define the polynomials @xmath80 via @xmath81 ( if @xmath82 , @xmath11 is undefined ) .",
    "these polynomials form an orthogonal polynomial family ( which is automatically monic ) if and only if    * @xmath68 are re - scaled ultraspherical polynomials , @xmath83 for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 . in this case",
    "@xmath87 for @xmath88 .",

    "[ remark : shift ] if equation   holds , so that @xmath100 then clearly also @xmath101 for any @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this is the source of the free parameter @xmath104 in the theorem .    using the binomial formula ,",
    "expand @xmath105 if for some @xmath66 , @xmath82 while @xmath106 , then comparing the coefficients of @xmath107 in the preceding equation and expansion  , we see that the coefficient is non - zero on the left and zero on the right .",
    "so all @xmath108 , and we may denote @xmath109 .",
    "then the same coefficient comparison gives @xmath110 , and for @xmath111 @xmath112 using this equation for both @xmath12 and @xmath113 , we then get @xmath114 if we want the polynomials to be orthogonal , by favard s theorem they have to satisfy a three - term recursion relation @xmath21 ( note that @xmath68 are clearly monic ) .",
    "we see that @xmath115 , and @xmath116 for @xmath111 .    now expanding further in the binomial formula , @xmath117 thus @xmath118 and for @xmath119 , @xmath120 therefore for @xmath119 , @xmath121 a formula which also holds for @xmath122 . for this to be zero",
    "we need @xmath123 or @xmath124 thus for @xmath125 , @xmath126 the general solution of this recursion is @xmath127 for @xmath66 .",

    "if @xmath132 , @xmath137 , then @xmath138 moreover , @xmath139 since for orthogonality , we need @xmath140 , clearly @xmath141 .",

    "it is now easy to see that this condition suffices for the positivity of all @xmath150 ; indeed , the corresponding polynomials are re - scaled ultraspherical polynomials .",
    "we recall ( * ? ? ?",

    ". the standard generating function ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.8.2 ) for ( monic ) chebyshev polynomials of the first kind is @xmath156 so it is not of the form  .",

    "the question of characterizing various classes of orthogonal polynomials has a long and distinguished history , see @xcite for an excellent survey up to 1990 .",
    "the study of general polynomial families goes back to paul appell in 1880 @xcite , who looked at polynomials with generating functions of the form @xmath162 for some function @xmath163 . these are now called appell polynomials . later , they were generalized to sheffer families with generating functions @xmath164 for some functions @xmath165 .",
    "the prototypical `` orthogonal polynomials characterization result '' is meixner s 1934 description of all _ orthogonal _ polynomials with the sheffer - type generating functions @xcite . on the other hand , among appell polynomials ,",
    "only hermite polynomials are orthogonal .",
    "see figure  1 .",
    "one way to state meixner s result is that orthogonal polynomials with generating functions   satisfy a three - term recursion @xmath166 for some @xmath167 ( up to re - scaling ) .",
    "the function @xmath168 for which these polynomials are orthogonal can be written down explicitly , but for different values of the parameters these functions look quite different .",
    "for example , for @xmath169 , we get the hermite polynomials , with a continuous orthogonality relation  . on the other hand , for @xmath170 , @xmath137",
    ", we get the charlier polynomials , with a discrete orthogonality relation",
    ". other polynomials in the meixner class carry the names of laguerre , krawtchouk , meixner , and pollaczek , and are orthogonal with respect to gamma , binomial , negative binomial , and meixner distributions .",
    "besides nice generating functions , the meixner class has many other characterizations and applications , see @xcite for an excellent ( but advanced ) survey .",
    "perhaps for this reason , many generalizations of this class have been attempted .",
    "the most popular of these are probably the @xmath171-deformed families .",
    "one approach ( there are several ) extends the sheffer class by looking at the generating functions of the form @xmath172 ( after appropriate normalization , one gets the sheffer form for @xmath173 ) . in this case",
    "the analog of the meixner class are the al - salam and chihara polynomials @xcite . for the study of two different types of @xmath171-appell polynomials ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "a different generalization of the sheffer class are generating functions of the general boas - buck @xcite type : @xmath174 for @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "the usual case corresponds to @xmath5 . in the boas - buck setting ,",
    "the problem of describing all orthogonal polynomials is wide open .",
    "the appell - type class ( with @xmath175 ) in this case consists of the brenke polynomials , and at least in that case all the orthogonal polynomials are known @xcite .",
    "now note that in the sheffer / meixner case in equation  , corresponding to @xmath5 , the generating function has an alternative form @xmath176 so another interesting class to look at are ( all or just orthogonal ) polynomials with generating functions @xmath177 which again gives the sheffer / meixner families for @xmath5 .",
    "the case @xmath178 appears in free probability @xcite , see section  3 of @xcite for the author s description of the `` free meixner class '' , which is in a precise bijection with the meixner class ( except for the binomial case @xcite ) . here",
    "again , one can write the generating function in two ways : @xmath179 more generally , boas and buck proved the following result .",
    "so as an alternative to the boas - buck formulation , we are interested in orthogonal polynomials with generating functions of the form @xmath183 , or at least in the appell - type subclass @xmath184 . for general @xmath185 , even this seems to be a hard question .",
    "however , the orthogonal appell polynomials are only the hermite polynomials , with the exponential generating function @xmath186 on the other hand , the orthogonal free appell polynomials are only the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind , with the ordinary generating function @xmath187 moreover , @xmath188 appears naturally in combinatorial proofs of the usual , free , and other central - limit - type theorems ( see for example lecture  8 of @xcite ) . thus it is reasonable to consider @xmath189 first , which leads to question  [ question : main ] .",
    "conversely , the answer to that question indicates that interesting generating functions ( and also , potentially , interesting non - commutative probability theories ) arise precisely for @xmath9 covered by the boas - buck theorem above , plus in the exceptional case @xmath190 not covered by that theorem .",
