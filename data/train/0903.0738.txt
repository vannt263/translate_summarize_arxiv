    "the origin of high - velocity runaway stars can be attributed to two basic processes : ( i ) disruption of a tight massive binary following the ( asymmetric ) supernova explosion of one of the binary components ( blaauw 1961 ; stone 1991 ; leonard & dewey 1993 ; iben & tutukov 1996 ) and ( ii ) dynamical three- or four - body encounters in dense stellar systems ( poveda , ruiz & allen 1967 ; aarseth 1974 ; gies & bolton 1986 ; leonard & duncan 1990 ) .",
    "in the first process , the maximum velocity attained by runaway stars depends on the magnitude of the kick imparted to the stellar supernova remnant [ either a neutron star ( ns ) or a black hole ] . for reasonable values of this magnitude",
    ", the runaway velocity does not exceed @xmath4 ( e.g. leonard & dewey 1993 ; portegies zwart 2000 ; see also gvaramadze 2009 ) . in the second process , the ejection velocity could be higher .",
    "one of the most important and best studied channels for producing high - velocity stars is through close encounters between hard ( aarseth & hills 1972 ; hills 1975 ; heggie 1975 ) binary stars ( mikkola 1983 ; leonard & duncan 1990 ) .",
    "numerical simulations by leonard ( 1991 ) showed that the maximum velocity that a runaway star ( usually the lightest member of the binaries involved in the interaction ) can attain in binary - binary encounters is equal to the escape velocity from the surface of the most massive star in the binaries . for binaries containing upper main - sequence stars ,",
    "the maximum velocity of runaways could be as large as @xmath5 .",
    "the result by leonard ( 1991 ) is often invoked to explain the high peculiar velocities measured ( or inferred ) for some runaway stars ( e.g. heber , moehler & groote 1995 ; maitzen et al .",

    "similar processes but acting in the cores of young massive star clusters ( ymscs ) and involving dynamical encounters with intermediate - mass ( @xmath8 ) black holes ( imbhs ) were considered in paperi ( see also gvaramadze 2006 ) to explain the origin of extremely high - velocity ( @xmath9 ) nss ( e.g. chatterjee et al .",

    "1998 ) , whose birthplace lies at about 7 kpc from the galactic centre ( tenjes et al . 2001 ) .",
    "while the existence of a supermassive black hole in the galactic centre is widely accepted , no conclusive evidence has been found for imbhs .",
    "these objects could be the descendants of very massive ( @xmath13 ) stars ( vmss ) , formed in the cores of ymscs through a runaway sequence of collisions and mergers of ordinary massive stars ( e.g. portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ; portegies zwart et al .",

    "2008 ; cf .",

    "moreover , numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of ymscs show that runaway collisions and mergers of ordinary massive stars can result in the formation of vmss with masses as large as @xmath21 ( e.g. portegies zwart et al .",

    "two necessary conditions should be fulfilled for the runaway growth of a vms .",
    "first , the parent cluster should be compact ( e.g. gaburov , gualandris & portegies zwart 2008 ; ardi , baumgardt & mineshige 2008 ) , i.e. dense enough to ensure that stellar collisions are frequent .",
    "second , the cluster should be massive ( @xmath22 ) , i.e. should contain a large number of ob stars ",
    "the main building blocks for the vmss .",
    "let us discuss these conditions in more detail .",
    "it is conceivable that the first condition is fulfilled for the majority of ymscs since their characteristic radius at birth ( i.e. during the embedded phase ) is @xmath23 pc , independently of their mass ( e.g. kroupa & boily 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the high central densities in young clusters could be either primordial ( e.g. murray & lin 1996 ; clarke & bonnell 2008 ) or caused by dynamical mass segregation ( e.g. portegies zwart et al .",
    "1999 ; grkan et al .",
    "the existing observational data on ymscs do not allow us to discriminate between these two possibilities .",
    "the observed top - heavy initial mass functions in the central parts of two of the most massive and dense ymscs in our galaxy , ngc3603 and arches , could either reflect the initial conditions in the cores of these clusters ( e.g. harayama , eisenhauer & martins 2008 ; dib , kim & shadmehri 2007 ; see , however , ascenso , alves & lago 2008 ) or have a dynamical origin ( e.g. harayama et al .",
    "2008 ; portegies zwart et al .",
    "it should be noted that the central stellar densities observed in these two clusters are lower than those required for runaway collisions to occur .",
    "it is possible , however , that either ngc3603 and arches were collisional at birth and their central density was already reduced due to dynamical decay or they are currently on the way to core collapse and runaway collisions . in the following ,",
    "we assume that , at a certain stage in the early evolution of ymscs , the star density in their cores was high enough for the runaway collisional process to proceed and for the formation of vmss .",
    "depending on whether the mass segregation in young clusters is primordial or of dynamical origin , the runaway collisional process ( accompanied by formation of vmss and ejection of high - velocity runaway stars ) starts respectively at the very beginning of the cluster evolution or after several myr ( i.e. when the star density in the cluster s core becomes enhanced via the spitzer instability ) . in the first case",
    ", the kinematic age of ejected stars will be close to the age of the parent cluster , while in the second one , it will be smaller by several myr .",
    "high - precise proper motion measurements for ob stars ejected from ymscs are required to discriminate between these two possibilities ( e.g. gvaramadze & bomans 2008b ) .",
    "the fact that our galaxy is populated by ymscs ( the second condition for the formation of vmss ) was acknowledged only recently ( paperi and references therein ; see also figer 2008 ) . the recent discovery of several clusters with @xmath24 ( borissova et al .",

    "2007a , b ; wolff et al . 2007 ; harayama et al .",
    "2008 ) indicate that ymscs are much more numerous than was hitherto known and that many of them can not be detected due to the heavy obscuration caused by the foreground and circumcluster dusty material .",
    "below , we estimate the number of star clusters with @xmath25 formed in the galactic disk during a certain interval of time , @xmath26 .",
    "since we are interested in the formation of high - velocity early b - type ( @xmath27 ) stars ( i.e. the progenitors of the majority of nss ) and high - velocity late b - type ( @xmath28 ) stars ( representative of the hvss ) , we consider two time intervals , @xmath29 myr ( the lifetime of a single lowest mass star producing a ns ) and @xmath30 myr ( the lifetime of a @xmath31 star ) . assuming that the star formation rate of @xmath32 , derived by lada & lada ( 2003 ) for embedded star clusters in the solar neighbourhood , is representative for the galactic disk as a whole ( see paperi for more details ) , one has that @xmath33 and @xmath34 were formed within a circle of 10 kpc during , respectively , the first and the second time interval .",
    "then taking a power - law cluster initial mass function with a slope of 2 ( e.g. lada & lada 2003 ) and assuming that the cluster masses range from 50 to @xmath35 , one has that @xmath36 and @xmath37 ymscs with @xmath38 were potentially available to produce the observed population of high - velocity early and late b - type stars , respectively . in the following",
    "we assume that ymscs of mass of @xmath39 contain ordinary stars as massive as @xmath40 ( weidner & kroupa 2006 ) , while the more massive clusters could harbour the vmss formed through the merging of ordinary massive stars .",
    "similar arguments show that @xmath41 and @xmath42 star clusters of mass of @xmath43 were formed in the galactic disk ( within a circle of radius of 10 kpc ) during the last 30 and 350 myr , respectively .",
    "these clusters produce stars as massive as @xmath44 ( elmegreen 2000 ; weidner & kroupa 2006 ) and could also contribute to the production of high - velocity ( @xmath45 ) runaway stars ( see section3 and section4 ) .",
    "close dynamical encounters between ( hard ) binary stars and a vms can result in the ejection of one of the stars with a high velocity . in this process ,",
    "one of the binary components is replaced by the vms , while the second one is ejected ( the so - called exchange encounter ) . for equal mass binary components and zero impact parameter ,",
    "the typical velocity attained by the escaper is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the orbital velocity of the ejected star in the original binary ( hills & fullerton 1980 ) .",
    "the ejected star gains its kinetic energy at the expense of the increased binding energy of the post - encounter ( newly formed ) binary .",
    "the production of high - velocity stars in exchange encounters between binary stars and a vms is similar to the process of star ejection in the course of close dynamical encounters between binaries and a supermassive black hole ( hills 1988 ) .",
    "the main difference is that in the first process the distance of closest approach of the binary to the central massive body is limited by the radius of the vms , @xmath48 , while in the second one it can not be smaller than the tidal radii of the binary components in the gravitational field of the black hole .",
    "our goal is to check how this distinction affects the typical velocity of ejected stars as well as the fraction of encounters resulting in high - velocity ejections .",
    "below , we use the results of hills ( 1988 ) to estimate the ejection velocity produced in exchange encounters and then in section4 we compare this estimate with results from numerical three - body simulations .    in the process of a close encounter between a binary and a vms ,",
    "the vms can be treated as a point mass if its radius is smaller than the binary tidal radius , @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are , respectively , the masses of the vms and the binary components ( @xmath52 ) , and @xmath53 is the binary semi - major axis",
    ". evolutionary models of vmss show that these stars develop a core - halo configuration ( more pronounced at the upper end of masses ) , in which most of the mass is concentrated in a dense and compact core while the rest of the mass is spread in an extended tenuous halo ( ishii , ueno , & kato 1999 ; yungelson et al .",
    "according to yungelson et al .",
    "( 2008 ; also yungelson , personal communication ) , 99 per cent of the mass of 500 and @xmath54 vmss is confined within a sphere of radius @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",

    "note also that although @xmath130 decreases with increase of @xmath53 , the fraction of escapers with a given velocity ( @xmath148 ) could be larger for wider binaries ( this is because the percentage of encounters resulting in exchanges increases with increase of @xmath53 ; see e.g. fig.1 in gualandris & portegies zwart 2007 ) .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig.[fig : branchm2 m ] , which shows that for binaries with @xmath149 au the percentage of escapers with @xmath150 is about 2.5 times larger as compared to the case of the more tight binaries ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : branchm2 ] ) .",
    "but for binaries with semi - major axis @xmath149 au.,width=302 ]",
    "we performed numerical simulations of dynamical encounters between hard massive binaries and a vms , in order to explore the hypothesis that this dynamical process could be responsible for the origin of high - velocity ( @xmath151 ) runaway stars . in our study",
    "we proceeded from the similarity between encounters involving a vms and those involving an imbh ( the latter process is already known to be able to produce high - velocity runaways ; paperi ; gualandris & portegies zwart 2007 ) and the fact that the radii of vmss are smaller than the tidal radii of the intruders ( the massive binaries ) , so that the tidal breakup and ejection can occur before the binary components merge with the vms ( section3 ; see also gvaramadze 2007 ) .",
    "our study was motivated by the recent evolutionary models of vmss ( belkus et al .",
    "2007 ; yungelson et al . 2008 ) , which suggest that vmss can lose most of their mass via copious winds and leave behind imbhs with masses of @xmath14 , which are not large enough to contribute significantly to the production of high - velocity runaway stars ( see paperi ) .",
    "we therefore explored the possibility that a vms could produce high - velocity escapers ( either early or late b - type stars ) before it finished its life in a supernova and formed a black hole .",
    "we estimated the typical velocities produced in encounters between very tight massive binaries and vmss ( with @xmath143 ) and found that about @xmath152 per cent of all encounters produce velocities of @xmath101 , while in about 2 per cent of encounters the escapers attain velocities comparable to those measured for hvss ( i.e. @xmath107 ) .",
    "we therefore argue that the origin of high - velocity ( @xmath15 ) runaway stars and at least some hvss could be associated with dynamical encounters between the tightest massive binaries and vmss formed in the cores of ymscs . in this connection",
    ", it is worthy to note that the theoretical velocity distribution for hvss produced in the galactic centre ( i.e. through the dynamical processes involving the supermassive black hole ) predicts the existence of a tail of velocities of up to several thousand @xmath153 , while the peculiar velocities observed for all known ( @xmath154 ) hvss do not exceed @xmath155 ( e.g. sesana , haardt & madau 2007 ; lckmann & baumgardt 2008 ) .",
    "interestingly , the latter figure better agrees with the maximum ejection velocity ( @xmath156 ) produced via dynamical three- and four - body encounters in dense star clusters ( see section3 and paperi ) . the future proper motion measurements for hvss with gaia will reveal what fraction of these extremely high - velocity stars originated in the galactic disk .",
    "we also simulated dynamical encounters between tight massive binaries and single @xmath157 stars ",
    "the most massive ordinary stars formed in clusters with @xmath158 ( weidner & kroupa 2006 ) .",
    "we found that from 1 to @xmath159 per cent of these encounters can produce runaway stars with velocities of @xmath142 ( typical of the bound population of high - velocity halo b - type stars ) and occasionally ( in less than 1 per cent of encounters ) produce hypervelocity ( @xmath160 ) late b - type escapers .",
    "note that the smaller production rate of high - velocity escapers in this case could be compensated by an order of magnitude larger population of clusters containing @xmath161 stars ( see section2 ) .",
    "our explanation for the origin of high - velocity runaway stars requires a very dense stellar environment of the order of @xmath162 stars @xmath163 ( see paperi ) .",
    "the role of this environment is three - fold .",
    "first , it makes possible the runaway merging process , resulting in the formation of vmss .",
    "second , it provides suitable conditions for production of tight binaries via the tidal capture process and hardens the existing binaries , thereby increasing the probability of energetic three - body encounters .",
    "third , it ensures that the three - body dynamical encounters are frequent , i.e. the production rate of high - velocity escapers could be high .",
    "we caution , however , that whether or not such high densities exist in the cores of star clusters remains unclear to date ( see section2 and cf .",
    "this and numerous uncertainties about the initial conditions and early evolution of young star clusters precludes us from making any estimates of the production rate of high - velocity escapers ( cf .",
    "paper1 ) . in paper1",
    ", we suggested that some extremely high - velocity nss could be the remnants of hypervelocity massive stars ejected via strong dynamical three- or four - body interactions in the cores of ymscs ( i.e. the origin of these nss should not necessarily be connected with asymmetric supernova explosions ) .",
    "our suggestion was based on the fact that one of the hvss known at that time , he0437@xmath105439 , is massive enough ( @xmath164 ; przybilla et al .",
    "2008a ) to explode as a typeii supernova and to leave behind a high - velocity ns .",
    "it is important to note that the time of flight of this star from the galactic centre exceeds the lifetime of the star and therefore the extremely high peculiar velocity of he0437@xmath105439 can not be attributed to the dynamical processes involving the supermassive black hole in the galactic centre .",
    "the most likely birth place of this hvs is one of the ymscs in the large magellanic cloud ( gualandris & portegies zwart 2007 ; cf .",
    "przybilla et al .",
    "2008a ; bonanos et al .",
    "2008 ; see however perets 2008 ) .",
    "recently , an even more massive ( @xmath165 ) hvs , hd271791 , was discovered ( heber et al .",
    "2008 ; see also carozzi 1974 ; kilkenny & stone 1988 ) whose birth place can not be associated with the galactic centre .",
    "hd271791 is the only hvs with measured proper motion and all measurements indicate that this star originated in the periphery of the galactic disk ( heber et al .",
    "thus , the high peculiar velocity of hd271791 can not be attributed to the ejection mechanism involving the supermassive black hole in the galactic centre .",
    "przybilla et al .",
    "( 2008b ) proposed that hd271791 was a member of a massive close binary system disrupted in an asymmetric supernova explosion and that the secondary star ( hd271791 ) was released at its orbital velocity ( @xmath166 ) in the direction of galactic rotation ( which allowed them to explain the galactic rest - frame velocity of hd271791 , provided that it is on the low end of the observed range @xmath167 ) .",
    "one can show , however , that to explain the high space velocity of hd271791 within the framework of the binary - supernova scenario , the stellar remnant of the supernova explosion [ a @xmath168 black hole , according to przybilla et al .",
    "( 2008b ) ] should receive at birth an unrealistically large kick velocity of @xmath169 ( gvaramadze 2009 ) .",
    "we therefore believe that the more likely origin of the peculiar velocity of hd271791 ( and other halo early b - type stars ; e.g. ramspeck et al .",
    "2001 ; martin 2006 ) is through the dynamical processes discussed in the present paper and in paperi .",
    "the same dynamical processes could also be responsible for the origin of early b - type stars observed in the halos of nearby galaxies ( e.g. comern , gmez & torra 2003 ) .",
    "we speculate that these stars can meet and ionize the cloudlets of cold gas on their way through the halo and suggest that the so - called extraplanar hii regions ( e.g. tllmann et al . 2003 ) could be the strmgren zones produced by high - velocity runaway ob stars ( cf .",
    "gvaramadze & bomans 2008a ) .",
    "our suggestion could be supported by the fact that the @xmath170-luminosities of two extraplanar hii regions in the galaxy ngc55 ( located at @xmath171 and 1.5 kpc from the galactic plane ) are consistent with the possibility that the ionizing sources of these objects are single b0 or o9.5 stars ( tllmann et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "high - velocity early b - type stars ejected at large angles to the galactic plane end their lives in the halo and thereby contribute to the population of halo nss .",
    "a possible example of a ns formed in the halo is the high galactic latitude compact x - ray source 1rxs j141256.0 + 792204 .",
    "this object has a high x - ray to optical flux ratio ( @xmath172 ) , typical of isolated nss ( rutledge , fox & shevchuk 2008 ) .",
    "if 1rxs j141256.0 + 792204 is indeed an isolated ns , then its distance from the sun is @xmath173 kpc , that corresponds to the distance @xmath174 kpc from the galactic plane ( rutledge et al .",
    "the surface temperature of 1rxs j141256.0 + 792204 ( inferred from modelling its spectrum as thermal blackbody ) suggests that this ns should be @xmath175 yr old , provided that its cooling follows the standard cooling curves .",
    "if one assumes that the ns was born near the galactic plane , then its peculiar velocity should be @xmath176 , which is too high to be realistic . to avoid this problem , rutledge et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggested that either 1rxs j141256.0 + 792204 is not an isolated ns ( i.e. the object is much closer to the sun ) or its cooling is non - standard ( i.e. the ns is much older ) .",
    "instead , we suggest that 1rxs j141256.0 + 792204 could be the remnant of a supernova explosion of an early b - type star ejected from a ymsc in the galactic disk with a velocity of @xmath177 , where @xmath178 myr is the lifetime of the star . it is obvious that even in the case of a symmetric supernova explosion the peculiar velocity of the stellar remnant ( the ns ) will be as large as that of its progenitor star ( paperi ) .",
    "we argue therefore that the proper motion of 1rxs j141256.0 + 792204 could be as small as @xmath179 [ i.e. @xmath154 times less than that suggested by rutledge et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ] or even smaller if the ns is near the apex of its trajectory . in the latter case",
    ", the direction of the proper motion of the ns could be arbitrary .",
