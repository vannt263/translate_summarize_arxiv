    "ion  beam crystallization is an exciting and relatively new field of physics in which a new state of matter is sought for .",
    "namely , ions which rapidly circulate in a storage ring and are cooled are expected to form geometrically  ordered structures ( crystals ) which have a density much smaller than normal crystalline solids @xcite .",
    "although great effort is currently invested in achieving such crystals @xcite , and cooling techniques were significantly improved @xcite , there is still no clear  cut experimental evidence for them .",
    "it is hoped , however , that crystalline beams will be produced in the near future .",
    "synchrotron radiation , on the other hand , is a very well - established field of physics that has been investigated continuously from the early days of particle accelerators .",
    "many synchrotron sources are operating around the world ( e.g. , desy ( hamburg , germany ) , nsls ( brookhaven , usa ) , kek ( tsukuba , japan ) ) , and many applications already exist @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to establish a link between beam crystallization and synchrotron radiation .",
    "this link is two  fold :    * to use synchrotron radiation and modifications thereof in order to _ detect _ the creation and existence of beam crystals .",
    "this is required since for fast beams direct detection methods are difficult to implement @xcite .",
    "thus synchrotron radiation can be used as an indirect diagnostic method to detect the formation of beam crystals .",
    "the diagnostic methods discussed below are also applicable to liquid and gaseous beams .",
    "* even more importantly , once beam crystals are formed , they can be used to _ modify _ the synchrotron radiation with respect to the ordinary incoherent case .",
    "therefore one can achieve dramatic suppression and enhancement effects of synchrotron radiation using crystallized beams @xcite .",
    "in particular , the total power that is radiated from an equi - spaced circulating chain of particles is much smaller ( in the appropriate limits @xcite ) than the radiation from the same number of randomly  located particles .",
    "this opens the possibility for accelerating particles to ultra - relativistic energies with little radiation loss , which is currently the main limitation of circular electron accelerators .",
    "thus the suppression of synchrotron radiation by beam crystallization may eventually lead to the construction of smaller ",
    "sized circular electron accelerators .    in the following we shall detail the connection between beam crystals and synchrotron radiation .",
    "it is important to emphasize that currently researchers are trying to obtain beam crystals of heavy ions that can be cooled with electrons and lasers . for heavy ions , however , the synchrotron radiation is small .",
    "even for protons , e.g. , the lightest of the `` heavy ions '' , the synchrotron radiation is about a factor @xmath0 smaller than for electrons with the same energy .",
    "thus , we expect that realistically the effects predicted in this paper will be important only for liquid or crystallized electron beams .",
    "this , however , poses the challenge of obtaining crystallized electron beams .",
    "thus we hope that the ideas put forward in this paper will motivate experimentalists to work towards obtaining crystallized electron beams . in any case , however , the analysis presented below applies to any species of charged particles .",
    "thus the theory can in principle be verified for ion  beam crystals .",
    "also we stress from the outset that the effects discussed below go beyond what is known as `` coherent synchrotron radiation '' which is the coherent enhancement of synchrotron radiation of small electron bunches for wavelengths that are longer than the bunch size ( see , e.g. , @xcite and sec .",
    "[ sec : bunched ] below ) .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way . in sec.[sec : theory ] we discuss the general theory that underlies the suppression and enhancement effects of synchrotron radiation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : form - factor ] the theory is applied to the three phases of a coasting charged  particle beam that occur in practice : gaseous , liquid and crystal . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bunched ] the necessary modifications of the theory for a bunched beam are discussed . in sec.[sec : total - power ] we present analytical and numerical results concerning the suppression of synchrotron radiation by a crystalline beam .",
    "finite temperature effects are discussed explicitly . in sec.[sec : summary ] we discuss our results and conclude the paper with proposals for experimental applications of the effects discussed in this paper .",
    "we consider @xmath1 charged particles with charge @xmath2 circulating in a circular storage ring of radius @xmath3 with velocity @xmath4 .",
    "the charges are assumed to be coherent with a reference circulating charge , but are allowed to have constant time lags @xmath5 as well as constant spatial displacements @xmath6 from the reference orbit . according to the theory of radiation of moving sources , the total power that is emitted from the @xmath1 charges",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the power that is emitted with frequency @xmath9 due to a single circulating particle , and @xmath10 is the form factor of the beam .",
    "the explicit expression for @xmath8 is @xcite @xmath11 ,   \\label{eq : i1nexact}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the speed of light , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the ordinary bessel functions @xcite .",

    "we observe that in the form factor the role of the time delays and the spatial displacements is equivalent .",
    "thus we restrict ourselves hereafter to time delays only .",
    "this simplifies the calculations and gives qualitatively the same results .",
    "it is also compatible with the current experimental trend according to which linear ion crystals ( one  dimensional crystals ) are sought for .",
    "we shall denote in the following the phase differences by @xmath20 .",
    "suppose now that we treat the quantities @xmath21 as random variables distributed according to the normalized probability density @xmath22 .",
    "then the expectation value of the total power is @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",

    "therefore we conclude that the crucial quantity that determines the modifications of synchrotron radiation due to coherence effects is @xmath29 , our main object of study .",
    "the physics of the particle beam ( temperature , structure ) is reflected in @xmath29 and is consequently linked to modifications of the synchrotron radiation .    before applying the above formulas",
    ", we make some further simple manipulations . to avoid complications with the @xmath30-periodicity we define @xmath31.\\ ] ] using the relation @xmath32 , easily derived from ( [ eq : r2-def ] ) , we obtain @xmath33 this can finally be recast as @xmath34 where @xmath35 , defined in @xmath36 $ ] , is the two  point correlator that does not include the `` diagonal '' part @xmath37 , emerging from the @xmath38 terms of @xmath29 .",
    "an important special case is the case of independent particles , i.e.@xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ( normalized ) one  point density of the particles . for this case",
    "the resulting form factor is @xmath41",
    "in the following we shall study a few representative situations of a particle beam as it is being cooled and crystallized .",
    "we shall qualitatively infer the form of the two  point correlator @xmath42 for each of the cases , and calculate the resulting form factor of the synchrotron radiation .",
    "thus the focus in this section is on the spectral modifications of the synchrotron radiation expressed by the behavior of @xmath43 .",
    "we shall show that the modifications of @xmath43 as the temperature is lowered defines an excellent tool for the diagnostics of the thermodynamic state of the beam .",

    "[ sec : bunched ] .",
    "the suppression of the total emitted power is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : total - power ] .",
    "we start with a very hot particle beam . in such a case",
    "we expect the particles to be completely independent",
    ". therefore equations ( [ eq : prob - independent ] ) and ( [ eq : gn - independent ] ) apply . for a particle beam that fills the whole ring ( coasting beam ) we expect on the basis of symmetry a uniform distribution @xmath44",
    "the form factor becomes @xmath45 thus , for a hot coasting beam , @xmath46 this is what we expect from totally incoherent radiation of @xmath1 particles .    for beams that are bunched ,",
    "a typical shape is a gaussian .",
    "the resulting density is @xmath47 ,    \\label{eq : p1-gaussian}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the location of the center of the bunch and @xmath49 is its angular width .",
    "the summation over @xmath50 is to ensure the @xmath51-periodicity . for @xmath52 , @xmath53",
    "only the @xmath54 component in ( [ eq : p1-gaussian ] ) is significant .",
    "the resulting form factor is @xmath55 in the bunched case , therefore , in addition to the incoherent term @xmath1 , we also obtain a term that represents the coherent synchrotron radiation for low harmonics @xmath56 .",
    "one obtains qualitatively the same results for other shapes of the bunch @xcite .",
    "the above results are well - known and form the basis of the field of `` coherent synchrotron radiation '' in which enhancement of the radiation is predicted @xcite and experimentally measured @xcite due to the collection of the charges ( electrons ) into small bunches . in our case",
    "this applies to the limiting case of a bunched but very hot beam of particles in which the particles within the bunch are uncorrelated .    in the following",
    "we shall introduce the correlations between the particles as the beam is cooled and use the full expressions ( [ eq : average - power])([eq : ff - rtilde ] ) rather than ( [ eq : gn - independent ] ) .",
    "these correlations are neglected in the field of coherent synchrotron radiation since the beam is assumed to be very hot .",
    "but the correlations become more and more important as the beam is being cooled . to simplify the treatment , we focus in this section on coasting beams . in sec .  [",
    "sec : bunched ] we introduce the necessary modifications to describe bunched beams .",
    "if the temperature of the beam is moderately high , we expect that the particles start to show repulsion from each other .",
    "that is , they will avoid the vicinity of each other due to the coulomb repulsion and act like a non - ideal `` gas '' .",
    "this can be described phenomenologically by @xmath57 ,    \\label{eq : r2-gas}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the trivial two  point correlator for a uniformly coasting beam of independent particles and @xmath59 is the ( angular ) `` hard  core '' scale of repulsion . interpreting ( [ eq : r2-gas ] ) , we modified @xmath60 by a narrow `` dip '' of width @xmath59 near @xmath61 ( the `` correlation hole '' ) such that @xmath62 ( total repulsion at @xmath61 ) .",
    "the constant @xmath63 is for normalization .",
    "it is approximately @xmath64 for small values of @xmath59 ( @xmath65 ) . actually ,",
    "since we are still in the high temperature regime , we need to assume that @xmath66 , i.e.  the hard core repulsion occurs on scales smaller than the mean distance between the particles . for @xmath67 , which is the interesting case here , the two conditions on @xmath59 are consistent .",
    "we note that @xmath59 depends on the temperature and increases as the temperature decreases . for @xmath68",
    "we obtain the following form factor : @xmath69 since the form factor is a non - negative quantity , we immediately infer an upper limit on @xmath59 : @xmath70 this result is intuitively clear since the hard core can not be larger than the mean distance of the particles .",
    "it is also compatible with the assumptions above concerning @xmath59 .",
    "physically , we observe that there is a _ suppression _ of the synchrotron radiation for @xmath71 ( lower harmonics )",
    ". we can therefore estimate the hard  core scale ( and hence the temperature ) from the coherent modifications of the synchrotron radiation for the gas  like state of the particle beam .",
    "we note that the overall suppression effect is small . for small @xmath72 values ,",
    "where the reduction of the emitted power is largest , the relative suppression with respect to the incoherent case amounts to only @xmath73 the situation is illustrated in fig .",

    "we used the parameters @xmath74 .",
    "when the temperature becomes smaller such that the coulomb energy is comparable to the thermal energy , we expect the particle beam to become somewhat ordered and to form a liquid  like plasma .",
    "the partial order is a precursor to crystallization . in particular , the ( angular ) distance",
    "on which the repulsion between particles is manifest is @xmath75 , and the order effects should persist over a few mean distances .",

    "as before , we assume @xmath67 .",
    "the above two  point correlator displays a strong repulsion for small distances ( @xmath78 ) as well as oscillations that persist for a few mean distances .",
    "it eventually reaches the asymptotic limit of uncorrelated particles .",
    "thus it represents an intermediate situation ( `` liquid '' ) between the slight mutual repulsion ( `` gas '' ) treated above and long  range order ( `` crystal '' ) discussed below .",
    "the above expression was obtained as a result of an exact calculation for a one  dimensional chain of particles with logarithmic repulsion by dyson in the context of random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "the resulting form factor is @xmath79 thus , the suppression effect is very prominent in this situation , and there is effectively complete suppression of the synchrotron radiation for small values of @xmath72 ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : liq ] ) . in terms of wavelength ,",
    "the suppression is felt for wavelengths that are comparable or longer than the mean distance between the particles .",

    "as crystallization takes place , long  range order effects become important .",
    "we consider in the following the simplest crystal , namely the linear chain .",

    "it is easier to obtain the form factor directly , without explicitly calculating the two  point correlator .",

    "for these special harmonics we get total constructive interference . the suppression of the leading harmonics results in an enormous reduction of the _ total _ power emitted by the synchrotron radiation ( see sec .  [",

    "we have shown that the synchrotron radiation and its modifications with respect to the incoherent state are strongly connected with the physical state of the beam .",
    "the form factor reflects the important scales and can be used to diagnose the state of the beam ( `` gas '' , `` liquid '' , `` solid '' ) as well as its temperature .",
    "experimentally it is sometimes useful to work with bunched beams in which the particles occupy only a small fraction of the ring .",

    "because of the structure of ( [ eq : ff - cry ] ) and the asymptotic exponential decay of @xmath175 for large @xmath72 we can compute the asymptotic behavior of @xmath173 for large @xmath1 . using ( [ eq : g1cry ] ) we obtain @xmath176 thus , for large @xmath1 and in all three relativistic regimes , the asymptotic suppression is independent of @xmath1 and saturates at @xmath177 .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig.[fig : supp ] which shows the suppression factor for @xmath178 , 100 and @xmath179 for all three values of @xmath165 considered .",
    "the onset of saturation in the vicinity of some @xmath180 is physically clear because of the following reason .",
    "finite @xmath89 corresponds to a finite temperature which furthermore corresponds to a finite correlation length of the particles in the linear chain .",
    "but since the suppression of the synchrotron radiation is a coherent process it is intuitively clear that no further suppression can be achieved once the total particle number exceeds the correlation length .",
    "consequently the suppression effect has to saturate .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : form - factor ] we pointed out that measuring the depth of the correlation hole in @xmath105 for small values of @xmath72 defines an experimental method for measuring the plasma parameter of the beam .",
    "since the saturation value of @xmath163 depends only on @xmath89 , measuring the suppression factor for large @xmath1 defines yet another experimental procedure for measuring @xmath89 .",
    "the existence of a finite correlation length at finite temperature provides an argument why it is not necessary to maintain coherence over the whole circumference of the storage ring in order to observe the suppression effect .",
    "it is enough to work with bunches whose length is smaller or of the order of @xmath181 to observe suppression of synchrotron radiation . from the mathematical point of view",
    "this is also evident since we saw that for finite temperature only lower harmonics of @xmath10 are affected by the bunching , hence @xmath182 , @xmath183 for large enough @xmath1 , and therefore we expect similar suppression as for the coasting case .",
    "this result is very important for practical applications of the suppression effect .",
    "it means that the coherence does not have to be maintained over the whole extent of the ring , which sometimes can amount to hundreds of meters and more .",
    "it is enough to maintain the crystalline structure over small angular distances ( bunches ) in order to exploit the suppression effect in possible technical applications .",
    "it is also clear by inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : in ] and of fig.[fig : liq](b ) that for large enough @xmath1 substantial suppression of synchrotron radiation can be achieved for liquid beams .",
    "this , again , is important since modern electron coolers are close to providing a liquid beam of electrons . thus it may soon be possible to check our theory with the help of liquid electron beams",
    "the suppression of the radiation of geometrically ordered charges was first noticed by j. j. thomson @xcite .",
    "he employed this effect for motivating the stability of atoms , which , according to classical theory , should radiate and decay .",
    "suppression of synchrotron radiation in the context of accelerators was first noted by l. i. schiff@xcite .",
    "but in schiff s time a mechanism for establishing the order in a beam of charged particles was not available . only recently , with progress in the cooling of beams by electrons and lasers is it possible to envision the production of crystallized beams whose synchrotron radiation is exponentially small .",
    "it should be born in mind , however , that synchrotron radiation is not very important for heavy ion beams that can easily be cooled with electrons and lasers .",
    "dramatic effects are expected to occur only for crystallized electrons where the synchrotron radiation is orders of magnitude stronger .",
    "the draw - back is that electrons can not be cooled directly with lasers .",
    "we hope , however , that this paper will stimulate experimentalists to develop cooling schemes for electron beams .",
    "one possibility would be to use sympathetic cooling of electrons with a beam of heavy ions that can be cooled by lasers .",
    "the paper discusses various forms of ordered beams that may occur in practice : gaseous , liquid and crystalline , coasting and bunched .",
    "it is pointed out that the suppression effect occurs on two levels : in the form factor of the beam and in the total radiated power .",
    "while the modifications in the form factor may be used as a diagnostic tool for inferring the thermodynamic state of the beam , the suppression of the total power may eventually lead to the construction of small ",
    "sized cyclic electron accelerators .",
