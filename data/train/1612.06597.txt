    "is dominated by strong electron - hole ( e - h ) interactions giving rise to bound e - h pairs , i.e. excitons .",
    "nowadays , the state - of - the - art method to describe excitonic effects in condensed matter is the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) @xcite within the gw approximation ( gwa ) @xcite of many - body perturbation theory @xcite . as a matter of fact",

    "on the basis of _ ab initio _ gw - bse calculations , we derive a general formalism to describe excitons in layered crystals starting from the knowledge of the excitations of a single layer . to this end , we proceed by analogy with molecular crystals @xcite , which can indeed be considered as the prototypical case of van der waals materials . in this way",
    "we obtain a general picture of excitonic effects in layered systems in terms of the interplay between e - h exchange interaction and band dispersion ( i.e. interlayer hopping ) , which allows us to distinguish in a simple manner excitons of different character ( e.g. intralayer and interlayer excitons ) . to numerically illustrate our analysis , we have chosen a prototypical layered material , namely hexagonal boron nitride , for which gw - bse calculations are well established @xcite . in hbn the calculated dielectric function has already shown to be in excellent agreement with experiment in a wide range of energy and momentum @xcite . here",
    "we obtain the eigenvalue spectrum of the excitonic hamiltonian as a function of momentum @xcite and discuss its relation with quantities that are accessible via experiments .",
    "the present work also extends to the exciton case ( via the bse formalism ) the previous _ ab initio _ investigations that studied plasmons ( i.e. collective electronic excitations ) in prototypical layered systems like graphite @xcite or multilayer graphene @xcite . in those materials , dielectric properties as a function of momentum @xmath0 and interlayer",

    "more recently , a `` quantum - electrostatic heterostructure '' model @xcite was similarly derived to describe the dielectric properties of complex multilayers starting from those of the single - layer building blocks , also taking into account the long - range coupling between layers due to the coulomb interaction . however , in both cases hybridisation effects were neglected : in the present work they will be analysed in detail in terms of interlayer hopping mechanisms .",
