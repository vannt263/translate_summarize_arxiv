    "a look at the sky , or a more modest one at the web , results in the realization that jets are emitted by many astrophysical systems ( stars , quasars , microquasars ... ) .",

    "while a cb crosses the domain permeated by the ambient light surrounding its parent sn , it is assumed to be expanding at a speed comparable to that of sound in a relativistic plasma ( @xmath33 ) .",

    "the rate of such a loss corresponds to an inwards radial force on the cb . in our analysis of grb ags",
    ", we made two assumptions : that this force counteracts the initial expansion , and that when the radius stabilizes , the inwards pressure is in equilibrium with the pressure of the cb s magnetic field plus that of the fagocitated ism nuclei that generate it .",

    "our two assumptions are no doubt extreme oversimplifications , but they are to be judged in light of two facts : 1 ) the extremely simple ensuing analysis of the elaborate time and frequency dependence of ags , which are dominated by synchrotron radiation of electrons in the field of eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) ; 2 ) there must be a reason why the cbs emitted by certain objects appear not to expand significantly , as in the example fig .",
    "( [ pictor ] ) .    as",
    "a cb pierces through the ism , its lf , @xmath41 , continuously diminishes , as its energy is dominantly transferred to scattered ism nuclei , and subdominantly to scattered electrons and synchrotron photons .",

    "( [ pictor ] ) the two jets of pictor a are shown , with contour plots corresponding to radio - intensity levels@xcite .",
    "we interpret this radio emission as the synchrotron radiation of the cb - generated _ cosmic - ray electrons _ in the ambient magnetic fields .",
    "similarly , the cbs of pictor a must be scattering the ambient nuclei , and converting them into _ cosmic - ray nuclei_.    the range of a cb is governed by the rate at which it loses momentum by encountering ism particles and catapulting them into crs .",

    "no reacceleration mechanisms far from the cr birth - sites need be invoked to accomodate the data .",

    "the hope is to observe the motion of a cb relative to the  fixed \" sky , or the _ relative _ motion of two cbs , moving in roughly the same direction , with large but unequal lfs .",
    "such measurements have been attempted in the case of grb 030329 , which had two observed cbs in the grb ( two @xmath0 pulses ) and in its ag , see fig .",

    "after all , our aim is to understand all of the salient features of the cr conundrum , not its nitty - gritty details !    2truecm",
    "we have argued that a large variety of high - energy astrophysical phenomena are interrelated , and easy to understand in extremely simple terms .",
    "the unifying concept is the ejection of relativistic blobs of matter in violent processes of accretion onto compact objects .",
    "the inspiring observations are those of quasars and microquasars .",
    "we have assumed that sne axially eject very relativistic cbs of ordinary plasma , as their finite supply of matter catastrophically accreting onto their central compact object is used up .",
    "this assumption , complemented by a variety of observations of pre - sn environments , explains not only the sn / grb association , but the properties of grbs and xrfs .",
    "the underlying process is ubiquitous in astrophysics : ( inverse ) compton scattering .",
    "none of the parameters involved in these predictions are put in by hand : they either rely on observations ( e.g. the early luminosity of a sn ) , or are borrowed from the cb - model analysis of grb afterglows ( the distribution of cb lorentz factors and of the cb - motion angles relative to the line of sight to observers on our planet , and the typical mass of a cb ) .    the analysis of grb ags requires extra assumptions that are no doubt over - simplifications : the way a relativistically expanding blob of plasma reaches an equilibrium radius as the process of radial reemission of the  collisionlessly \" scattered charged ism particles quenches the expansion , and the way in which the cb s magnetic - field pressure thereafter compensates the inwards force of the radially exuding particles .",
    "but the ensuing description of ags as the synchrotron radiation from the ism electrons entering the cbs is simple and successful : the ag light curves and wide - band spectra of all grbs of known redshift are well fit and , when predicted , correct .",
    "several predictions of the cb model of grbs , we contend , are supported by the data , but require further corroboration .",
    "one is the hyperluminal motion of the cbs themselves , which may be easier to detect in xrfs : when not too far , they are simply grbs seen at larger angles .",
    "another prediction concerns the ag x - ray lines , which in the cb model are not the generally - assumed lines of fe and other intermediate elements , but the highly doppler - boosted lines of light elements , notably h ly-@xmath157 lines@xcite .",
    "since cbs decelerate in the ism as they emit these radiations , the lines should evolve towards lower frequencies in a predicted fashion@xcite .    on the basis of much less observational input , we propose@xcite that short - duration grbs are associated with type ia sne ( 30% of the sne are of this type , 30% of grbs are short ) .",
    "if the observers did not give up so early in attempting to discover the weak ag of short grbs but waited for a few weeks for the peak sn light the sn ought to be observable .",
    "that would be good news for cosmology , even if grb - associated type ia sne deviate from the usual ",
    "standard candle \" properties : in the cb model sne are roughly axially but not spherically symmetric .",
    "sn1998bw and the other almost identical sne associated with grbs ( some spectroscopically established ) , are ordinary sne seen very close to their axis . both type ia and core - collapse sne ought to be closer to standard  torch - lights \" than to  candles \" .",
    "we have also seen that the cb - model explains the shape of the cr electron spectrum , and the related spectrum and angular distribution of the gbr , most of which is not  cosmological \" : it is associated at high latitudes with our own galactic halo .",
    "higher - energy data on cr electrons and the gbr might confirm the model by discovering the predicted  knees \" in the corresponding spectra@xcite .",
    "seeing the  gbr \" light from the halo of andromeda would also be quite a coup@xcite .",
    "we do not have further predictions on the properties of x - ray emitting rich clusters , except that cooling flows are not cooling flows .",
    "it is the mechanism of _ heating _ that we have identified : cb - induced crs .",
    "the rest of the properties of these clusters are also well and simply explained@xcite .",
    "there should be no substantial flow of plasma , no substantial shock - induced heating ...",
    "the cb model of crs is rather successful , considering that only one parameter was adjusted .",
    "clearly the results could be improved , as better data are gathered ( e.g. on composition at all energies above @xmath158 tev ) .",
    "many simplifying choices were made : a spacially constant ism composition , a 50 - 50 contribution of nuclei accelerated and unaccelerated within a cb , a nave energy dependence of the galactic - confinement factor ... even so , the distribution of crs in the galaxy , their total luminosity , the broken power - law spectra with their observed slopes , the position of the knee(s ) and ankle(s ) , and the alleged variations of composition with energy are all explained in terms of simple physics . naturally , ",
    "life \" may be more complicated , e.g.  nearby sne could contribute low - energy crs , accelerated by conventional shock mechanisms@xcite .",
    "there is no tell - tale cb - model - specific prediction concerning crs , except that they are deposited along very long lines exiting star - death regions , as opposed to points in these very regions , as in standard models",
    ". this prediction might be testable in the search for line inhomogeneities in the radiation from cr electrons .",
    "the cb model is not a _ theory _ of practically all high - energy astrophysical phenomena .",
    "it is lacking a deeper theoretical understanding of the magneto - dynamics within a cb ; and of _ cannons _ themselves : the engines generating the mighty ejections of compact astrophysical objects .",
