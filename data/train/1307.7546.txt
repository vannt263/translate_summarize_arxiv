    "here we concentrate attention on the single - attribute case where @xmath181 are pairs of real - valued random variables .",

    "tba however becomes , in a sense , more general than the expected utility approach by allowing for stochastic dependence between targets and prospects .",
    "in fact the tba considers more general decision rules , if we admit the possibility of some correlation between the target and the prospects .",
    "if @xmath187 and @xmath278 are not independent , @xmath287 does not coincide anymore with the distribution function @xmath288 . for further discussion see again @xcite .",
    "we now briefly summarize the arguments of sections [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] in the perspective of a decision problem where , for a fixed target @xmath278 , we aim to rank two different prospects with marginal distributions @xmath289 and with connecting copulas @xmath290 , corresponding to the pairs @xmath291 and @xmath292 , respectively .",
    "in the case of independence , a prospect @xmath9 should be obviously preferred to a prospect @xmath8 if @xmath12 . in the case of dependence , on the contrary , this comparison is not sufficient anymore .",
    "in fact the choice of a prospect @xmath187 should be based not only on the corresponding distribution @xmath276 , but also on the connecting copula of the pair @xmath181 .    for fixed @xmath28 , the quantity",
    "@xmath293 is equal to the quantity @xmath67 for all pairs such that @xmath294 with @xmath263 belonging to @xmath6 ( see proposition  [ foranypair ] ) . for @xmath295 , the implication @xmath296 does not necessarily hold ( see proposition [ bcgamma ] example [ ex:1 ] ) . for two different prospects @xmath0 ,",
    "proposition  [ eta_ineq ] guarantees that , when @xmath297 , the condition @xmath298 implies @xmath299 .",
    "as shown by example  [ ex:2 ] , when @xmath300 , we can have both the conditions @xmath301 and @xmath298 @xmath302 . concerning the quantities @xmath303 and @xmath304 , theorems",
    "[ lgamma ] and [ continuo ] show that , for @xmath305 ( @xmath223 ) , @xmath306    let us consider the case when the only available information about @xmath307 and @xmath308 is that @xmath309 ( i.e. that @xmath310 belongs to the class @xmath311 ) .",
    "then a rough and conservative choice between @xmath8 and @xmath9 suggests to select @xmath312 with the larger value of @xmath313 , provided @xmath314 or that @xmath0 are nearly identically distributed ."
