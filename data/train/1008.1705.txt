    "periodically kicked rotor is a popular model that has served as a paradigm to understand hamiltonian chaos both in the classical and quantum regime @xcite .",
    "this was originally introduced as a simple model for dynamical chaos but was sufficiently general enough to cover many physical situations .",
    "for instance , problems like the hydrogen atom in microwave fields and motion of a comet around the sun driven by a suitable planet can be reduced to that of kicked rotor @xcite .",
    "this system is also paradigmatic for another important reason ; it obeys kam ( kolmogorov- arnold - moser ) theorem @xcite .",
    "this implies that , as a control parameter is varied , the transition from regularity to chaos occurs progressively by breaking of invariant curves in phase space .",
    "once all the invariant curves are broken down , diffusive global transport of particles in phase space becomes possible . in the corresponding quantum regime , this classical diffusive transport is inhibited by the onset of dynamical localisation @xcite .",
    "this was experimentally realised in the laboratory with cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite and is the basis for theoretical and experimental realization of chaotic ratchets in recent times @xcite",
    ".    on the other hand , there are other physical systems that exhibit classical chaos but violate the kam theorem , the so - called non - kam systems .",
    "this class includes the kicked harmonic oscillator ( kho ) @xcite and the kicked particle in infinite square well potential @xcite . in both these cases ,",
    "when a parameter is varied , the invariant curves are replaced by stochastic webs @xcite , an intricate chain of islands and globally connected channels , through which particle transport becomes possible .",
    "non - kam type is also relevant for an important class of physical systems , namely the dynamics of particles in quantum wells and barrier structures . till date , non - kam systems have been experimentally realised in semiconductor superlattices in tilted magnetic fields in which the enhanced conductivity could be attributed to non - kam chaos @xcite .",
    "further , measurement of lochschmidt echo using a non - kam system , namely , the ion trap with harmonic potential in the presence of a kicking field @xcite has also been proposed .",
    "inspite of this , very few non - kam systems have been investigated and they have not been explored in sufficient details .",
    "another motivation for this work stems from the considerable interest in recent times in the dynamics of condensates placed in finite box - type potentials acted upon by a periodically kicking field . in a recent experiment , henderson et .",
    "@xcite have constructed a quasi-1d finite box , using a combination of optical and magnetic trap , with the bose - einstein condensates in the box receiving periodic kicks .",
    "this set - up was used to study the effect of atomic interactions on the transport of becs . in place of the dynamical localisation they observed a classical saturation in the energy of becs due to a balance between the energy gained from kicks and the energy lost by leakage of becs over the finite barrier @xcite .",
    "apart from this , a series of experiments @xcite that studied the transport of becs in the presence of disordered potential have reported such classically induced energy saturation effects .",
    "then the question is if it is possible to observe such classically induced energy saturation in chaotic systems without inter - particle interactions and what would its mechanism be ? we show that kicked particle in finite well type potential that we study in this paper shows this feature and we discuss its mechanism .",
    "it is also relevant to point out that following the achievement of becs in the optical box trap @xcite , theoretical investigations of resonance and anti - resonance behaviour and its relation to the kam and non - kam type dynamics for becs in 1d infinite well have also been performed @xcite .",
    "further , experiments exploring the interface of nonlinear dynamics of electrons in 1d quantum well irradiated at terahertz frequencies have already been reported @xcite .",
    "although non - kam type dynamics is a generic feature in physical systems such as the potential wells not much work has been done on this class of problems . however , on the theoretical front , infinite square well potential confining a delta - kicked particle has been studied @xcite . in the light of recent attempts to study chaotic ratchets @xcite , in both the classical and quantum sense , it would be useful to open the potential to allow for particle transport .",
    "this could lead to chaotic ratchets that can utilise non - kam features of its classical system for directed transport . in this paper , we study a periodically kicked particle initially held in between a finite double barrier structure .",
    "double barrier heterostructures play an important role in electronic devices that use resonant tunnelling diodes @xcite though without the kicking potential .",
    "primarily we present numerical explorations of this problem to study its rich dynamical features . in the next section , we introduce our model and in subsequent sections we discuss the classical and quantum dynamics of this system .",
    ". the well region has width @xmath0.,width=268 ]    we consider the dynamics of a non - interacting particle initially located in between two potential barriers each of height @xmath1 and width @xmath2 distant @xmath0 apart ( see fig .

    "these orbits do not encounter the discontinuities in the potential multiple times and hence the energy of the particles evolving on such quasi - periodic orbits will not diffuse .",

    "the behaviour is similar to the classical diffusive regime of the standard map .",
    "the existence of steady state can be understood as follows .",
    "for the parameters used in figure [ nessfig ] the phase space in region @xmath129 is fully chaotic . as kicks begin to act , any localized classical distribution @xmath196 is quickly dispersed throughout this region .",
    "the total energy @xmath61 of the particles in the well region increases .",
    "simultaneously , the particles with @xmath102 leave the finite well leading to loss of energy . soon",
    "the loss process becomes significant and at every kick cycle the energy lost ( due to barrier crossings ) is more than the energy gained from the kicking potential .",
    "thus , @xmath61 begins to decrease .",
    "however , after the time scale @xmath195 , the net energy change and the number of particles vary in such a manner as to maintain the mean energy @xmath187 a constant ( apart from fluctuations ) .",
    "this arises because the normalised momentum distribution remains nearly invariant with time as shown in fig .",
    "[ ness_state ] .",
    "the chaotic mixing inside the well ensures that , despite the loss of energetic particles , momentum distribution remain invariant .",
    "thus , chaos between the barriers is essential to support the ness .",
    "one of the factors that determine @xmath195 is the rate at which any initial distribution of states diffuses in the chaotic region and steady state distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ ness_state ] is achieved .",
    "this rate increases with @xmath6 in general . for the present case with complete chaos",
    ", one expects this rate to be proportional to @xmath197 , just like in the diffusive regime of standard map and hence one expects @xmath198 .",

    "[ nessfig ] show a good agreement with this gross estimate for @xmath195 .",
    "this steady state holds good until nearly all the particles have escaped out and only a fraction @xmath199 remains in the well .",
    "based on rate of diffusion in chaotic region , we can estimate the time at which this happens to be @xmath200 . since @xmath199",
    ", we get @xmath201 . in the semiclassical regime",
    ", this mechanism carries over to the quantum dynamics as well .",
    "notice that @xmath202 is larger than other relevant time scales , i.e , @xmath203 .",
    "further , @xmath202 is typically about few hundreds of kick cycles and hence we expect this to be experimentally accessible time scale as well . on a much longer time scale as @xmath204 , all the energetic particles escape and the steady state decays out .",
    "indeed , a similar non - equilibrium steady state has been experimentally observed with periodically kicked bose - einstein condensate in a finite box for strong kick strengths @xcite .",
    "these steady states have a classical explanation . typically , the standard kicked rotor exhibits energy saturation and steady state , for large kick strengths , in the quantum regime due to destructive quantum interferences .",
    "we emphasise that the energy saturation , in our model as well as for the bec in finite box @xcite , is induced by the classical effects and leaves a trail in the semiclassical regime .",
    "fig [ nessfig ] shows that the quantum mean energy @xmath205 follows the classical curve quite closely .",
    "these results correspond to @xmath206 and reflect the behaviour in the semiclassical regime .",
    "larger values of @xmath6 correspond to moving away from semiclassical regime towards purely quantum regime .",
    "thus , we should expect quantum averages to deviate from classical averages in a pronounced manner .",
    "this is borne out by the numerical results in fig [ nessfig](a , b , c ) .",
    "there is current interest in quantum non - equilibrium steady states about which not much has been explored until now @xcite . for @xmath207 , the quasiperiodic orbits of the standard map are sufficiently destroyed to allow global transport in phase space .",
    "then , particles do not have to rely on discontinuities in @xmath35 to diffuse in phase space .",
    "this leads to unlimited energy absorption by the particles between the barriers and ness is not supported .",
    "then , the system essentially works like the kicked rotor in the strongly chaotic regime .",
    "as pointed out earlier , the region covered by the quasi - periodic orbits @xmath100 with @xmath186 is non - diffusive .",
    "now , consider curves @xmath208 such that maximum value of @xmath209 for both these curves is equal to @xmath210 as shown in fig .",
    ". then , all the curves @xmath100 with @xmath211 will have @xmath212 $ ] .",
    "so any state evolving on one of them will always get reflected at the barriers .",
    "thus , to escape from the finite well , every phase space point in the chaotic region must first reach any @xmath100 with @xmath213 . as time @xmath97",
    ", all the particles would have escaped from the well and get locked on to one of the invariant curves @xmath100 of the corresponding standard map .",
    "thus , the momenta of escaping particles settle to a stationary distribution on @xmath100 with @xmath213 .",
    "thus , the momentum distribution reaches a steady state as @xmath97 and their mean energy @xmath214 saturates to @xmath215 .    in fig .",
    "[ ness - local](a ) , the broken curve ( blue ) shows @xmath216 for the classical system .",
    "as this figure shows , the mean energy of the system increases with time and asymptotically approaches @xmath216 . in the semiclassical regime , we expect a similar behaviour for the quantum average and this is shown as dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ ness - local](a ) .",
    "the small difference in saturated values of quantum and classical mean energies can be attributed to the finiteness of planck s constant which makes its effect felt as @xmath6 increases .",
    "further , fig .",
    "[ ness - local ] ( b , c , d ) also shows the classical momentum distribution @xmath217 and its quantum analogue @xmath218 for the same set of parameters after evolving the system for @xmath166 , 275 and 300 kicking periods .",
    "probability distribution in position representation ( not shown here ) reveals that at @xmath219 and 300 the probability density in between the barriers is negligible . nearly identical distributions in fig .",
    "[ ness - local](b , c , d ) mark the existence of steady state . notice that small departures from semiclassical regime is also visible here in the form of slight difference between classical and quantum distributions . for the energy saturation effect ,",
    "complete chaos between barriers is not essential .",
    "if some sticky islands are present between the barriers , the saturated classical and quantum distributions as @xmath97 will display a non - zero component in the finite well region .",
    "these non - chaotic components tend to remain localized and will never escape out .      as demonstrated in section 5(b ) , when all the chaotic particles exit from the finite well region , a steady state is reached .",
    "one possible manifestation of this asymptotic state is the momentum filtering effect that occurs for certain choices of parameters .",
    "it is possible to choose system parameters such that momentum distribution of escaped particles becomes narrow .",
    "thus , any broad initial momentum distribution at @xmath183 , after sufficient kicking periods , leads to a distinctly narrow momentum distribution .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ mfilt ] . in this figure ,",
    "the initial conditions are uniformly distributed in the chaotic layer lying in between the barriers .",
    "this chaotic layer also ensures that the final result is independent of the details of the initial distribution .",
    "the figure shows the momentum distributions @xmath220 ( classical ) and @xmath221 ( quantum ) plotted for @xmath222 . by this time , a large fraction of particles have escaped from the well and the distribution has become bimodal with distinct peaks near @xmath223 and @xmath210 .",
    "this shows that the double barrier structure , in presence of the kicking field , acts as a momentum filter .",
    "we obtain filtering effect for a range of kick - strengths ( not shown here ) and observe that with decrease in @xmath6 , the two bands in bimodal distribution become narrow .",
    "however , the time at which system approaches steady state corresponding to this bimodal distribution becomes very large .",
    "indeed , since it is experimentally possible to design barrier heights of desired choice , it will be be possible to use double barrier structure to produce filter with desired value of @xmath210 . from fig .",
    "[ psec1 ] , we note that the escaped particles follow extremely close set of invariant curves and their speed , averaged over time , will converge to the winding number of the orbits involved . hence , the speed distribution will have peaks of infinitesimal width at @xmath224 .",
    "it is pertinent to note that a momentum filtering effect based on a very different mechanism has been studied by monteiro et .",
    "al . in the context of a variant of kicked rotor model @xcite .",
    "we emphasise that all the dynamical features discussed in section 5(a , b , c ) can be explained on the basis of ( i ) co - existence of diffusive and non - diffusive regions which exists because the non - kam nature of the system affects the dynamics differently in different phase space regions , and ( ii ) presence of kam curves through out the phase space outside the double barrier region .",
    "hence , all the dynamical features can be attributed to the interplay between the kam and non - kam behaviour of the system .",
    "in summary , we have presented primarily numerical results of the dynamics of non - interacting particles in a double barrier structure acted upon by periodic kicking field .",
    "this model differs from the paradigmatic kicked rotor .",
    "this is essentially a non - kam system and hence chaotic dynamics sets in for even for infinitesimal excursions from the integrable limit of kicking strength @xmath33 .",
    "further , this displays non - equilibrium steady state and classically induced suppression of energy growth in the semiclassical regime .",
    "this is in contrast with the classical kicked rotor that displays diffusion only for @xmath225 and its quantum version arrests this through dynamical localisation , an outcome of quantum interferences .",
    "some of the earlier works on the double barrier type potential have considered it as a scattering problem , in a different setting with a drive term .",
    "for example , see references @xcite .",
    "an incoming wavepacket hits the left barrier ( see fig .",
    "[ scheme ] ) and tunnels in to it and , depending upon the parameters chosen , some or all of it emerges out of the right barrier .",
    "this mechanism requires purely quantum effects such as tunneling and in this work we have deliberately avoided them to focus on the semiclassical regime . since tunneling probability",
    "is nearly zero in this semiclassical setting , any initial distribution placed anywhere outside the barriers @xmath226 will continue to evolve on the kam like invariant tori .",
    "however , based on the results obtained in this paper , we can speculate about the case when quantum effects come into play .",
    "tunneling will allow a wavepacket to enter the through the left barrier and non - kam chaos will ensure that it gets dispersed .",
    "but now , the wavepacket can tunnel out through the right barrier .",
    "this scenario could potentially lead to an interesting competition between above barrier crossings and tunneling .",
    "another interesting case relates to periodic version of this model which can also be used for directed transport .",
    "we are pursuing these questions and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the dynamical features in our model such as the non - equilibrium steady state and classically induced energy growth suppression are of current interest in the general context of transport and localisation especially for interacting systems such as the bose - einstein condensates .",
    "recently there have been several experimental results that point to classical features suppressing energy growth of condensates @xcite .",
    "typically , in such experiments , condensates are released from a confining potential and their expansion in a disordered potential is studied .",
    "when chemical potential @xmath227 , where @xmath1 is the strength of disorder , condensates are classically reflected from the fluctuations of the disordered potential effectively localising the condensates . in our model , particles are neither interacting nor there is any disordered potential .",
    "however , the non - kam chaotic dynamics and kam like invariant curves provide the essential ingredient for the suppression of diffusion .",
    "even as the particles are transported in the position space their energy absorption is restricted as @xmath228 by kam like structures .",
    "such studies form an important background to understand and clearly distinguish similar quantum phenomena like the anderson localisation from the classically induced ones and also to explore the connections between interactions , localisation and disorder .",
    "quantum chaos in double barrier potentials have been studied before experimentally using gaas / algaas heterostructures @xcite though not with a periodic kicking field . in these experiments electrons tunnel through the double barrier potential and chaos is induced within the barriers due to the field created by the charge accumulation in the well @xcite . since resonant tunnelling plays an important role in this experiment , this can be regarded as being quantum in nature without classical analog .",
    "the double barrier system in eq . [ ham ] could be used with resonant tunnelling to study purely quantum effects as well though in the present work we have primarily explored the classical and semiclassical features .",
    "the foregoing arguments also imply that the system can also be realized experimentally in a laboratory . the cold atoms in optical lattices",
    "is the testing ground for variants of kicked rotor .",
    "an experimental set - up involving cold atoms , optical lattices with double barrier heterostructures should be possible .",
    "currently there is considerable interest in the exciting field of chaotic ratchets @xcite .",
    "generally , ratchets are systems with broken spatio - temporal symmetries from which directed transport can be obtained even in the absence of a net bias .",
    "there have been several proposals and at least one experimental realization for a chaotic ratchet in the last few years .",
    "the system presented in this work lacks the spatial periodicity required of a ratchet .",
    "but the kicking potential , being sinusoidal , is already spatially periodic .",
    "further , from a theoretical perspective , it is not difficult to have spatially periodic double barrier structures .",
    "then , it might become possible to realize ratchet dynamics in this system .",
    "all the existing chaotic ratchet proposals are based on systems that obey kam theorem .",
    "the model presented in this work might lead to new ways to use non - kam type dynamics for deterministic , directed transport .",
    "the authors acknowledge many useful discussions with dilip angom during the course of this work .",
    "numerical calculations for quantum system are carried out on prl 3tflop cluster computer .",
    "one of the authors ( hp ) thanks manjunatha of cdac and computer center staff for suggestions and assistance in efficiently using cluster computer .",
    "consider a particle that evolves on an invariant curve of the standard map @xmath229 , approaches right barrier at @xmath230 with @xmath231 during its motion after @xmath232kick , crosses it and exits on to another invariant curve of standard map @xmath233 . in this appendix , we show that as the width of the barrier @xmath112 , @xmath234 .",
    "after the particle crosses the interface at @xmath82 and if @xmath235 denotes the time it will take to cross the barrier region of width @xmath2 , then @xmath236 if @xmath120 .",
    "hence , the probability that a particle will experience the next kick while crossing the barrier will also tend to zero .",
    "hence we can assume that the particle does not experience a kick while crossing the barrier .",
    "in such a situation , the particle will face only two discontinuities between @xmath45th and @xmath237th kick .",
    "thus , @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 . from our assumptions ,",
    "@xmath241 lie on @xmath242 , and @xmath243 will lie on @xmath244 .",
    "@xmath245    similarly , @xmath246 substituting for @xmath247 and @xmath248 from eq . [ eqa1 ] in eq .",
    "[ eqa2 ] , we get , @xmath249 using @xmath250 , we get , @xmath251 .",
    "this implies @xmath252 or @xmath253 .",
    "we show that for certain special choices of @xmath254 , reflection from the walls of potential @xmath35 takes a state from invariant curve @xmath134 to its symmetric counterpart @xmath136 , where @xmath134 and @xmath136 are related through reflection symmetry about @xmath255 .",
    "let @xmath256 then , @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "let @xmath259 lie on @xmath134 .",
    "reflection from the right boundary at @xmath260 will take it to @xmath261 on the invariant curve @xmath262 .",
    "the spatial periodicity of @xmath263 in the standard map implies that @xmath264 is on @xmath262 .",
    "since @xmath265 is on @xmath136 and @xmath136 is unique , we have @xmath266 .",
    "thus , the effect of reflection from the right boundary at @xmath260 is to take a state from @xmath134 to @xmath136 if eq .",
    "[ eqb1 ] is satisfied .",
