    "the serpens molecular cloud is a magnificent laboratory for the study of multiple low mass star formation .",
    "the cloud core has a high density of young stellar objects ( ysos ) , including several submillimetre sources : for a distance of 260pc , kaas ( 1999 ) estimated a surface density of 400  800 ysos per square parsec , which is several times higher than found in the star forming western parts of the @xmath8s ( @xmath9100pc@xmath10 , bontemps et al . 2000 and references therein ) .",

    "cores in low mass star forming regions are generally thought to be cold , with temperatures of about 20k or below .",
    "emission from such objects will peak at wavelengths typically longer than 100@xmath1 m , which makes the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) on board the infrared space observatory ( iso ) an instrument more suited than iras   to study these sources .",
    "in addition , the lws  provides two orders of magnitude higher spectral resolution over its spectral range of 50 to 200@xmath1 m .",

    "finally , in sect.5 , the main conclusions of this work are briefly summarised .",
    "a grid of 25 positions of fir - spectra in the @xmath7  was obtained with the long - wavelength spectrometer ( lws ; 43  197@xmath1 m , @xmath17 ) on board the infrared space observatory ( iso ) on october 21 , 1996 .",

    "the formal map centre , viz .",
    "@xmath18 = and @xmath19 = , epoch j2000 , coincides to within 10@xmath20  with the position of the sub - millimetre source smm1 .",
    "the pointing accuracy in the map is determined as 1@xmath20  ( rms ) .",
    "the spacings between positions in the map , oriented along the coordinate axes , are 100@xmath20  in both right ascension and declination .",
    "these offsets correspond to the pre - flight estimates of the circular lws - beam , hpbw .",
    "the actual beam widths are however smaller , 70@xmath20  to 80@xmath20 , leading to appreciable spatial undersampling .",
    "this is also evident in fig.[davispoi ] , where the lws - beams and pointings are represented by circles .",
    "the size of the @xmath21 lws - map is thus 8@xmath2@xmath38@xmath2 , corresponding to @xmath22@xmath23pc@xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the distance to the @xmath7  in units of the adopted value of 310pc ( delara et al .",
    "1991 ) .    at each map -",
    "point the grating of the lws  was scanned 6 times in fast mode , oversampling the spectral resolution by a factor of 4 .",
    "each position was observed for nearly 15min .",
    "the centre position was re - observed half a year later on april 15 , 1997 , for a considerably longer integration time ( 24 spectral scans ; larsson et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the internal agreement between the deep integration and the map spectrum is excellent , giving confidence that the rest of the map data is also of good quality .",
    "our map spectra were complemented with lws  spectra at 7 positions inside the mapped area , which were retrieved from the iso - archive ( table[obstab ] ) .",
    "in addition , 1d - spectral observations with the short - wavelength spectrometer ( degraauw et al . 1996 : sws ; fov=@xmath26 to @xmath27 , 2.4 ",
    "45@xmath1 m , @xmath28 ) and imaging spectrophotometry with the continuous variable filter ( cvf ; 2.5 ",
    "15.5@xmath1 m , pixel - fov=6@xmath20 , @xmath29@xmath3035 ) of isocam   ( cesarsky et al . 1996 ) were also analysed .",
    "further , broadband isocam  images at 6.7 and 14.3@xmath1 m  and with pixel - fov  both and 3@xmath20  were part of the observational material .    in summary ,",
    "table  [ obstab ] provides an overview of the observational material employed in this paper .",
    "fig.[davispoi ] shows the sws  and lws  pointing positions superposed onto the sub - millimetre continuum map ( 450@xmath1 m ) of davis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , where 9 discrete sub - millimetre sources ( smm1  smm10 , except smm7 ) are identified .",
    "the lws  observations were pipeline - processed ( olp7.1 ) and were subsequently reduced with the interactive analysis package lia .",
    "post - pipeline processing of the sws  and lws  data was done with the package isap and of the isocam  data with the corresponding cia programs .    at each position ,",
    "the individual lws  scans for each of the 10 detectors were examined , ` deglitched ' and averaged .",
    "corrections were applied to the ` fringed ' spectra in the map .",
    "the fringing indicates that the emission is extended and/or that point sources were not on the optical axis of the lws , i.e. the radial distance from the optical axis was larger than about 25@xmath20 .    for the lws  data we believe that the absolute flux calibration is good to an accuracy of 30% ( swinyard et al .",
    "1996 ) , whereas relative offsets between overlapping spectral regions of adjacent detectors were generally within 10% ( ` detector stitching ' uncertainty , see also fig.[rawdata ] ) .",
    "internally , the lws - accuracy is much higher than 30% for the @xmath7 , as is evidenced by observations of the same targets at different times and under different observing conditions ( e.g. , pointed vs. mapping observations ) .",
    "the absolute accuracy could be less , however , in the very weak spectra towards the northern and western edges of the map , for which the flux uncertainties are dominated by the dark current correction .",
    "this was estimated based on measurements directly before and after , but not during , the mapping observations .",
    "suspected dark current drifts during the observation of the first 5 map points , viz . from ( 200@xmath20 , 200@xmath20 ) to ( 200@xmath20 , 200@xmath20 ) , were however approximatively linear in time , whereas for the remaining spectra , the dark current seemed to have stabilised at a constant value .",
    "support for our applied dark current corrections is provided by the fact that these resulted in fluxes which are in very good agreement with iras - issa data at 60 and 100@xmath1 m  ( formally within 7% and 4% , respectively , see : fig.[smm1bbfit ] ) .",
    "the reduction of the sws  data is similar to that of the lws  data , whereas the reduction of the cvf  data involved additional corrections for transients and flat field .",
    "from fig.[rawdata ] it can be seen that detectable fir  emission is present at all observed positions .",
    "the sensitivity of these map data at long lws  wavelenghts is of the order of 10@xmath31w cm@xmath10 @xmath1m@xmath33  ( about 3jy per beam at 100@xmath1 m ) , whereas this noise level becomes worse by a factor of about two towards the shorter wavelengths .",
    "as pointed out in sect.2.2 , most of the observed spectra were fringed .",
    "the situation is different at the map centre , where the lws  spectrum shows hardly any fringes at all .",
    "this strongly suggests that the fir - emission is dominated by a source which is pointlike to the lws  and which was reasonably well centred in the aperture during the observation . as is also evident from fig.[lwscontmap ] , where lws  measurements in 6 continuum bands between 45@xmath1 m  and 165@xmath1 m   are presented , that this source dominates the emission at all fir  wavelengths . in the following section",
    ", the physical characteristics of this source will be discussed .",
    "the centre position of the map dominates the emission over the entire wavelength range of the lws  ( fig.[lwscontmap ] ) .",
    "this map point coincides with the strong sub - millimetre source smm1/firs1 . at fir  and",
    "sub - mm wavelengths , this source is relativly isolated .",
    "any problem of source confusion is therefore very much reduced in this case .    as evident in fig.[smm1bbfit ] , the fir  spectrum is well fit by a single blackbody of temperature 36k .",
    "such a relatively high temperature was also determined by , e.g. , nordh et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , harvey et al . ( 1984 ) , mcmullin et al . ( 1994 ) and davis et al . ( 1999 ) .",
    "the diameter of the hypothetically circular source is @xmath97@xmath20 , i.e. @xmath34au .",
    "this latter value confirms the point - like nature of the far - infrared source , as was suspected in the previous section on the basis of its largely unfringed spectrum .",
    "it is also comparable to the source sizes seen in the interferometric observations at millimetre wavelengths by hogerheijde et al .",
    "in contrast , the temperature derived here is significantly higher than the 27k obtained by hurt & barsony ( 1996 ) from high resolution iras  data ( hires ) .      in fig.[smm1modbbfit ]",
    ", the lws  spectrum is shown together with data collected from the literature . from this overall spectral energy distribution ( sed )",
    "it is clear that the lws  data are sufficient to determine the luminosity of the source .",
    "however , it is also apparent that at longer wavelengths the sed is steeper than the rayleigh - jeans fall - off of the blackbody ( @xmath35 ) , which could indicate that the emission is becoming optically thin somewhere outside the spectral range of the lws .",
    "provided that in this optically thin regime the dust opacity follows a power law , viz .",
    "@xmath36 , this index @xmath37 can be determined from the observations , since then @xmath38 as @xmath39 for any density and/or temperature structure of the envelope ( spherical symmetry and central radiating source ) .",
    "a least squares fit to the data between 0.8 mm and 3.4 mm yields @xmath40 . at these relatively long wavelengths ,",
    "this statistical error is considerably larger than any deviation of the modified rayleigh - jeans law from the ( modified ) planck curve , viz .",
    "$ ] , which for @xmath42k would result in the `` correction '' of @xmath43 by @xmath44 .    following standard procedures ( e.g. hildebrand 1983 , emerson 1988 )",
    ", we can then estimate the envelope mass .",
    "using only the data between 40@xmath1 m  and 3 mm , which were collected with sufficiently large telescope beams , i.e. larger than 7@xmath20  and shown as open symbols in fig.[smm1modbbfit ] , a modified blackbody can be fit to this section of the sed for a single temperature .",
    "hence , the flux density is given by    @xmath45    with obvious notations .",
    "in this wavelength regime , the opacities of dust grains generally display power law dependencies ( e.g. , ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) .",
    "hence , let the continuum optical depth scale as    @xmath46    a first order correction for the finite beam sizes to the flux density ( shown as small open symbols in fig.[smm1modbbfit ] ) was included by    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the beam size of the lws  at different wavelengths , @xmath49 ( see section [ deconv ] and fig.[lws_beam_size_fit ] ) , @xmath50 is the beam size of the telescope in question , @xmath51 is the source size , and @xmath52 is the source flux reported in the literature .",
    "any dependence of the source size on the wavelength is naturally accounted for by the radiative transfer modelling of sect.[rad_trans ] . here",
    ", it is assumed that the source size is the same as that of the blackbody fit and constant with wavelength .",
    "this modified blackbody remains optically thick far beyond 100@xmath1 m , up to @xmath53@xmath1 m , the wavelength of unit optical depth .",
    "longward of this wavelength the emission is optically thin and the total column density , @xmath54(h@xmath55 ) , can be estimated from    @xmath56    so that    @xmath57    taking @xmath58 at @xmath59 mm ( ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) and @xmath60 , @xmath61 for molecular gas and the gas - to - dust mass ratio @xmath62=10@xmath24 , the average column density is @xmath54(h@xmath55)=1.3@xmath63cm@xmath10 . for the assumed source radius of 1100au ,",
    "the mass of the optically thin envelope of smm1 is 2.2@xmath23m@xmath6 .",
    "the average volume density @xmath64(h@xmath55 ) corresponds then to several times 10@xmath65@xmath66 , which is consistent with our choice of the theoretical opacities for grains with thin ice mantles for dense protostellar regions .",
    "however , the observationally determined value of @xmath37 seems only marginally compatible with the opacity law , for which @xmath67 .",
    "if one accepts that the opacities are generally correct per se , the observed low @xmath37 values ( see also table[tab_smm_bb_par ] ) could indicate that the optical depth through the dust has been under - estimated even at long wavelengths .",
    "the assumption of an isothermal , homogeneous sphere is of course very crude and physically not at all compelling .",
    "however , the lws  data do not contain any information which can constrain the structure of the source .",
    "hogerheijde et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , on the other hand , found evidence for structure in the visibility curves of their mm - wave data and adopted a radial power law distribution for the density , @xmath68 with @xmath69 , so that their model of smm1 is more centrally condensed . for a spherical , centrally heated optically thin dust envelope , a power law is also expected for the temperature profile , viz . @xmath70 .",
    "the exponent is in this case given by @xmath71 , where @xmath37 refers as before to the wavelength dependence of the absorption cross section of the dust grains . since @xmath72",
    ", the temperature profile could be expected to exhibit @xmath73 , a value which was indeed also used by hogerheijde et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that smm1 is a so called class0 source ( andr et al .",
    "1993 ) and the correct assessment of its envelope mass ( and central mass , of course ) is of particular importance for such type of object . in the following section",
    ", we shall attempt to improve on the reliability of the parameters for smm1 by treating the radiative transfer through the dust envelope in a self - consistent manner .    before doing that",
    ", we need to address the possible near - infrared excess over a class0 sed , however ( see fig.[smm1modbbfit ] ) .",
    "it is clear that over the 7@xmath20  source size , the deduced column density , @xmath54(h@xmath55)=10@xmath74cm@xmath10 , would imply an accompanying visual extinction of @xmath75@xmath910@xmath76mag ( bohlin et al .",
    "1978 , savage & mathis 1979 ) , or still nearly @xmath77mag at 2@xmath1 m   ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) . therefore , on arcsecond scales around smm1 one would hardly expect any detectable direct flux in the near - infrared .",
    "this assertion is confirmed by isocam - cvf  observations ( table  [ obstab ] ) which show that the nir  flux originates from a source different from smm1 . in fig.[smm1_cvf ] , a map of the spectra on the 6@xmath20  pixel scale are shown .",
    "obviously , smm1 and the source west of it do not have the same seds in the 3 to 15@xmath1 m  region .",
    "hence , we conclude that the sed of smm1 contains less nir  flux than indicated in fig.[smm1modbbfit ] and , consequently , these observations are supporting the view that smm1 is indeed a class0 object .      the models by hogerheijde et al .",
    "( 1999 ) are based on the assumption of optically thin emission .",
    "however , it was realised in the previous section that optical depth effects might affect the sed of smm1 even at long wavelengths .",
    "in order to test this hypothesis we have run models of the transfer of radiation through the dust envelope of the source",
    ". a fuller description of these computations will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( larsson et al . in prep . ) . from the comparison with the observations ,",
    "these self - consistent models provide the temperature distribution in the envelope .",
    "for instance , fig.[smm1_temp ] depicts the true temperature profile of the hogerheijde et al .",
    "model of smm1 ( see below ) . for the general cloud background",
    "we estimate a temperature of 20k , and that flux has been subtracted from the model of smm1 .    complying with hogerheijde et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we adopt a spherically symmetric geometry of the dust envelope about a central heating source and a radial power law distribution for the density , with @xmath78 ( in order to reproduce the visibilites obtained by these authors ) , i.e. @xmath79@xmath66 , which reproduces the density at 100au we inferred from that paper . as",

    "( e.g. , lucy 1974 ) and applied it to the entire set of lws - map data ( table  [ obstab ] ) .",
    "the first of two basic assumptions is that all sources are point - like , which is probably reasonable considering the large beam size of the lws   ( hpbw@xmath970@xmath20 ) . in support of this",
    ", smm1 was found , in the previous sections , to be a point source .",
    "secondly , the exact positions of all sources are assumed known and kept fixed .",
    "these were taken from isocam  observations in the mid - infrared ( kaas 1999 ) and/or from observations in the sub - millimetre by davis et al .",
    "we then pick an arbitary grid point within the field of the lws - map and try to estimate , at that location and for a fixed frequency , the radiative flux which originated from all sources in the field .",
    "this is done at all locations and for all lws  wavelengths in an iterative scheme as described in more detail in appendixa .",
    "for the restauration of the source spectra , the band - width corresponded always to the spectral resolution @xmath89 .",
    "for the wavelength dependent beam pattern of the lws , @xmath90 , the azimuthal averages of the presently best known values were used ( see fig.[lws_beam_size_fit ] ) . this was done for all ten detectors of the lws   and out to @xmath9150@xmath20  from the beam centre , which would correspond to about the 5% level of a perfectly gaussian beam .",
    "the observational basis for this was raster mapping of the point - like planet mars ( b.m.swinyard and c.lloyd 1999 , private communication ) .    in fig.[lucy_sources ] , the sources which were included in the modelling are identified and shown together with the pointings of the lws .",
    "these sources are recognized as the strongest ones at sub - millimetre ( smm@xmath91 , except smm7 and 10 ) and/or at mid - infrared wavelengths ( svs2 , svs4 and svs20 ) .",
    "the spectra were corrected for background emission , which was defined along the northern and western edges of the map ( see figs.[rawdata ] and [ smm1bbfit ] ) . for these prominent sources ,",
    "convergence was typically achieved after five iterations . in general",
    ", the computations were halted after visual inspection of the results , but tests were run up to 1000 iterations demonstrating that the solutions were stable . in appendixb",
    ", a demonstration of the algorithm s reliability is provided using known source spectra .",
    "it is also gratifying to note that the procedure left , as could be expected , the spectrum of smm1 essentially unaltered , i.e. the _ maximum likelihood method _ solution for this source is entirely within the quoted errors .",
    "yet another check was provided by an lws  guaranteed time observation half a beamwidth south ( labelled ` flow ' in table[obstab ] ) , which was correctly recovered by our method .",
    "since these observations were apart in time by 1year , this result also indicates that no significant fir - intensity variations have occurred on that timescale .    to properly appreciate the results to be presented below and summarised in tables [ tab_smm_bb_par ] and [ tab_smm_phys_param ] , it might be useful to remember that the method attempts to retrieve information which is hidden inside the spatial resolution of the observations . therefore",
    ", these solutions represent , at best , very likely possibilities of what these source spectra might look like .",
    "note that the 30 spectral bins were treated as independent observations , so that the fact that the resulting seds are continuous and have a meaningful appearance , lends confidence in the method .",

    "a few sources are however dominant , viz . in the near infrared smm6/svs20 and at submillimetre wavelengths smm3 and",
    "smm4 , respectively .",
    "satisfactory solutions were obtained for the sources smm3 and smm4 , whereas the broad spectrum of smm2 can not plausibly be represented by a modified single - temperature blackbody ( see fig.[mlm_2_3_4 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the interferometric observations by hogerheijde et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and by choi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which failed to reveal a central condensation for smm2 .",
    "kaas ( 1999 ) found a @xmath92-band nebulosity at this position .",
    "we interpret its lws  spectrum therefore to be that of an extended structure .",
    "dust temperatures of smm2  4 are of the order of 30k ( table[tab_smm_bb_par ] ) , which is in general agreement with earlier work ( harvey et al .",
    "1984 ) , but which again contrasts to the lower values obtained by hurt & barsony ( 1996 ) .",
    "also the extent of the fir  photospheres is considerably smaller , on the order of a few arcsec rather than ten arcsec .",
    "for these optically thick envelopes ( tab.[tab_smm_bb_par ] ) the masses , which are in the range 2 to 6m@xmath6 , would be severly underestimated by the optically thin approximations ( tab.[tab_smm_phys_param ] ) .",
    "the point source assumption leads immediately to inconsistencies for svs2 , which would become unreasonably bright in the far infrared , which is highly unlikely given the non - detection of the source at longer wavelengths ( fig.[mlm_svs2_4_20 ] ) .",
    "an overall better solution is obtained for an extended source , filling the lws  beam .",
    "the modelling by hurt & barsony ( 1996 ) gave a very different picture , which yielded three nearly equally strong fir  point sources , with svs2 being only slightly stronger at 100@xmath1 m .",
    "the modelling results in largely undetectable lws  fluxes for svs4 and svs20 . in particular for svs4 , these low flux levels are consistent with the lack of detection at 3 mm , whereas for svs20 some emission is possibly present at the shortest lws  wavelengths .",
    "the objects of this group are clearly visible at near infrared wavelengths , as stellar clusters and nebulosity and in table[tab_smm_bb_par ] , these objects are therefore identified as nir  sources .",
    "further , our solutions for the lws  data provide reasonable complements to the cvf  data ( see fig.[mlm_svs2_4_20 ] ) , which have been obtained at the considerably higher spatial resolution of 6@xmath20  and , hence , are as such not dependent on any models .",
    "these sources represent the fainter members of the south - eastern group in the @xmath7 .",
    "the objects designated ps ( point source ) by hurt & barsony ( 1996 ) are labelled hb1 and hb2 in figs.[lucy_sources ] and [ mlm_8_hb12 ] . whereas the algorithm finds reasonable solutions for smm8 and hb2 , identifying them as point sources of roughly 5@xmath20  size at @xmath13@xmath3020k",
    ", it fails for smm11/hb1 . at that location ,",
    "kaas ( 1999 ) recently found a source at 2@xmath1 m .",
    "the members of this group , north of smm1 , include smm9/s68n , smm5 and deos , the ` deeply embedded outburst star ' of hodapp et al .",
    "as previously pointed out , the strong fir  source smm1 is comfortably displaced from the other three sources , the lws  data of which are quite severely confused ( see fig.[lucy_sources ] ) .",
    "these confusion problems have also been encountered by hurt & barsony ( 1996 ) , who divided the total flux into three equal parts among these objects .    at the position of smm5 , no recognisable point source was found at lws  wavelengths ( fig.[mlm_5_9_deos ] ) .",
    "the object coincides with a bow - shock shaped nebula and it could be that no well defined pre - stellar condensation exists .",
    "on the other hand , it is quite likely that smm5 simply is relatively too weak to be detectable . in order not to unnecessarily increase the noise ,",
    "the source was excluded from further modelling .    towards the s68n complex ,",
    "two independent lws  observations exist : one is a pointed observation , the other a grid point in our map .",
    "spatially , these two observations are separated by about half a beamwidth ( 33 ) , and temporally , by about half a year ( table  [ obstab ] ) .",
    "the difference in flux amounts to about a factor of two , as would be expected , if s68n solely would dominate the fir  emission in this region .",
    "the observations by davis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) revealed smm9/s68n to be the dominant submm source , by factors of about 2  3 in flux .",
    "we expect , therefore , this source to be the brightest also in the far infrared , i.e. at the _ longest _ lws  wavelengths .",
    "this seems indeed to be the case , as shown in fig.[mlm_5_9_deos ] , where the modelling reveals a relatively cool source ( @xmath13@xmath3020k ) .",
    "a further underlying assumption of our deconvolution method is that the emission does not vary with time .",
    "this was previously taken tacitly for granted , since this condition is normally fulfilled in the far infrared . for the outburst source deos , there is a potential risk , however , that this may not apply . between august 1994 and july 1995 , this object had increased its brightness by almost 5mag in the @xmath92-band ( hodapp et al .",
    "1996 ) .    at",
    "near to midinfrared wavelengths , deos was observed , during about one year and a half , by t.prusti with the sws  on six different dates ( see table[obstab ] : april 14 , 1996 , to october 22 , 1997 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the short - wave sed is displayed in fig.[swsfuor ] , from which it is evident that , between april and october 1996 , the sws  flux had dropped by a factor of two .",
    "this is remarkably similar to what happened to the ( quasi-)simultaneous lws  spectra and led us to suspect that some or most of the fir  flux in fact was due to deos rather than to smm9 , as might have been concluded on the basis of the discussion in the previous paragraph .",
    "llccc object & filter & 14 apr 96 & 22 sep 97 & ratio +    deos & lw2 & 2.8 & 2.2 & 1.27 + deos & lw3 & 6.8 & 5.4 & 1.26 +   + ec53 & lw2 & 0.90 & 0.90 & 1.00 + ec53 & lw3 & 1.12 & 1.15 & 0.97 +    fortunately , the possibility exists to check the temporal behaviour of the sws  data with independent isocam  observations ( see table[tabcam ] ) .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on cam  images , which were obtained in two broad - band filters centred on @xmath97 ( lw2 ) and 15@xmath1 m  ( lw3 ) , respectively .",
    "these observations were performed when deos was both in the sws - high ( april 14 , 1996 ) and in the sws - low state ( september 22 , 1997 ) .",
    "table[tabcam ] summarises the photometry results for deos and a reference star ( ec53 ) , expressed in jy / beam , where the ` per beam ' refers to the aperture size of the sws .",
    "evidently , the cam  data also reveal significant variability for deos , by a factor of about 1.3 in both filters . at 7@xmath1 m ,",
    "the sws  spectra are too noisy to be meaningfully measured , but the sws   data in the 15@xmath1 m  region are in excellent agreement with the cam - value .    in conclusion",
    ", the evidence presented firmly establishes that deos had changed its flux in the near- to mid - infrared between april and october , 1996 .",
    "it seems very likely therefore that also the lws  spectra show traces of this variability . in this context",
    "we recall that in the submillimetre smm9/s68n is the strongest source .",
    "hence , it seems very likely that , at the time of the lws  observations in october 1996 , deos was not dominant at the longest wavelengths , but might have contributed significantly at the shorter lws  wavelengths . a longwave fit for s68n to the pointed lws  observation",
    "was properly scaled and subtracted and the spectro - spatial deconvolution modelling was done for the residual .",
    "this led finally to the solutions for the seds of deos presented in fig.[deos ] .",
    "the joining of the _ observed _ sws  and _ modelled _ lws  spectra for both the high and the low state is quite spectacular .",
    "this indicates that the algorithm we have used is indeed capable of providing satisfactory results .",
    "we suggest therefore that the spectra presented in fig.[deos ] represent the most likely seds for the outburst source deos .",
    "as far as we are aware , these would be seen for the first time and should be helpful in constraining outburst models and , perhaps , in differentiating source type ( e.g. fuor vs non - fuor or exor ) .",
    "the far - infrared seds of fuors appear very different though ( fig.[fuor2 ] ) .",
    "tabs.[tab_smm_bb_par ] and [ tab_smm_phys_param ] summarise the results of the lws  observations and our spectro - spatial deconvolution modelling . for cool sources ,",
    "the good wavelength coverage and resolution of the lws  is generally better adapted to estimate the temperature than the poor resolution and short range of iras  data .",
    "the source emission is generally optically thick in the lws  spectral range .",
    "compared to the estimates based on iras  data by hurt & barsony ( 1996 ) our temperatures of the smm sources are generally higher , indicative of a larger number of photons heating the dust .",
    "this is also effectively expressed by our larger luminosities , although the derived sizes of the fir  photospheres ( e.g. , @xmath93 ) are generally smaller than the dimensions obtained by hurt & barsony ( 1996 ) .",
    "we have deduced the observed @xmath37 values from the slopes of the rayleigh - jeans part of the source seds and obtain generally quite shallow distributions , viz .",
    "this is in line with the findings by , e.g. , casali et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , testi & sargent ( 1998 ) and davis et al .",
    "however , for a given source , the scatter among different observations is large and it appears doubtful that @xmath37 could be a useful diagnostic for smm - type objects .",
    "in fact , the observed flatness probably indicates that the assumption of optically thin emission is not valid .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by detailed radiative transfer models , in which the temperature distribution is self - consistently calculated .",
    "models were calculated for five sources , for which sufficient data were available , viz .",
    "smm1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 9 .",
    "these models are optically thick out to millimetre wavelengths and envelope masses are in the range 26m@xmath6 .",
    "the luminosities of these smms are in the range 1070l@xmath6 .",
    "much or most of this luminosity is presumably produced by mass accretion processes .",
    "these depend on the centrally accumulated mass .",
    "it is at present difficult to tell whether the smms will end up on the main sequence as low - mass or as intermediate mass stars ( @xmath9513m@xmath6 ; the distance too comes in here as a crucial parameter ) . as oh and/or h@xmath55o  masers normally are found towards young sources of higher mass , the detection of such emission towards smm1 by rodrguez et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and curiel et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , respectively , would speak in favour of the intermediate mass option , at least for that object . in any case , the existence of these massive envelopes around the smms argues for the idea that these sources are in a very early stage of their development .",
    "one can also speculate that most of these massive envelopes will have become dispersed on a relatively short timescale ( @xmath910@xmath80yr ) .",
    "the main conclusions of this work can be summarised as follows :    * in order to disentangle the contribution of individual sources to the fir  emission in a 8@xmath2@xmath38@xmath2  map obtained with the iso - lws  a _ maximum likelihood method _ is introduced .",
    "this spectro - spatial deconvolution technique enabled us to restore the firspectra ( 50 to 200@xmath1 m ) of previously known submillimetre sources ( smms ) . * observations of smms with the lws  are advantagous as the data sample the peak of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "this permits an accurate determination of the dust temperatures .",
    "these temperatures are generally found to be higher than those obtained from high resolution iras  data .",
    "* fits to the observed seds by modified blackbodies reveal that the smms are generally optically thick at lws  wavelengths . * in addition , for reasonable assumptions about the grain opacities , the rayleigh - jeans part of the observed seds is significantly flatter than what would be expected for optically thin dust emission .",
    "we interpret this to indicate the smms to be optically thick out too much longer wavelengths than previously assumed .",
    "* self - consistent radiative transfer calculations confirm the correctness of this assertion .",
    "these models of the smms are optically thick out to mm - wavelengths .",
    "these dust envelopes are massive , several m@xmath6 , suggesting that these sources are still in their very infancy . *",
    "the outburst source deos has been observed with various instruments aboard iso  and at different times .",
    "the source had certainly varied in infrared brightness and we present the full infrared spectra , at both high and low states , for the first time .",
    "the aim of the presented algorithm is to restore the seds of sources in a crowded field . to be able to handle spatially undersampled and noisy spectroscopic data we developed a program based on the _ maximum likelihood method _",
    "( e.g. , lucy 1974 ) .",
    "the present discussion is based on our lws  observations , but the method per se should of course be more widely applicable .",
    "the first of two basic assumptions is that all sources are point - like , which is probably reasonable considering the large beam size of the lws   ( hpbw@xmath970@xmath20 ) .",
    "secondly , the exact positions of all sources are assumed known and kept fixed .",
    "we then pick an arbitary grid point within the field of the lws - map and try to estimate , at that location and for a fixed frequency , the radiative flux which originated from all sources in the field .",
    "this is done at all locations and for all lws  wavelengths in an iterative scheme as described in the following .",
    "the photon distribution can be assumed to follow poisson statistics and , hence , the probability to observe @xmath96 detector counts at the position @xmath97 can be written as    @xmath98    where    @xmath99    is the expected number of counts at position @xmath97 , arriving from @xmath100 sources , each contributing @xmath101 counts and being at positions @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath90 is the diffraction pattern of the instrument ( the ` beam ' , see fig.[lws_beam_size_fit ] ) .",
    "designating the likelihood to observe the counts from a map containing @xmath103 points by    @xmath104    one can also write    @xmath105    solving for the maximum likelihood , viz .",
    "@xmath106    for all positions @xmath102 , or    @xmath107    from the last expression , a correction factor can be obtained    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is now the observed flux ( for a linear detector ) at position @xmath97 and where    @xmath110    is the expected flux at this position , originating from @xmath100 sources at positions @xmath102 and contributing the flux @xmath111 .",
    "finally , the iteration is then    @xmath112    for all wavelengths @xmath49 , yielding the source spectra .",
    "as an example of a test case , an observation of the lws  map was simulated .",
    "we chose four fir  spectra , the shape of which is described by simple geometric figures ( positive ramp , negative ramp , rectangular box and triangle : see fig.[orgsed ] ) .",
    "the point - like sources of these spectra were distributed on the lws  grid in the manner depicted in fig.[mapsource ] , i.e. source1 centred on a grid point ( which therefore should not be affected by the convolution , but still by the noise ) , source2 on the half - power contour of the lws  beam , source3 situated half - way between two grid points and source4 farthest away from any grid point .    at each wavelength ( spectral resolution @xmath89 ) for every map position the sources were convolved with the lws  beam of fig.[lws_beam_size_fit ] and ( white ) noise was added .",
    "this results in the simulated observations shown in fig.[mapdata ] .",
    "these `` observed '' maps ( one per spectral bin ) were then run thrugh the _ maximum likelihood _ algorithm for a number of iterations .",
    "the result of the deconvolution is shown in fig.[itres ] , where the succession of iterations is ordered vertically for each of the four sources .",
    "the first row shows the start conditions , where we `` guessed '' a simple constant spectrum in all cases .",
    "these straight line spectra have changed to resemble the true source spectra already after the first run . in this particular test case , the deconvolutions have converged after about 4 iterations ( fourth row ) , i.e. successive iterations do not give further improvements .",
    "apparently , the spectra of particularly source1 , as expected , but also of sources2 and 3 are very well reproduced .",
    "the most difficult test case is source4 ( cf also fig.[mapdata ] ) , which is located farthest away from the map points , and therefore considerably more affected by the noise .",
    "nevertheless , our method reproduced its spectrum reasonably well too .",
