    "since then , a dozen of small - scale anisotropy measurements have hinted that the doppler peak resulting from acoustic oscillations of the baryon - photon plasma on the last scattering surface seems to be present  @xcite .",
    "cmb measurements gain an advantage over other traditional observations due to the fact that the small cmb fluctuations can be well treated as linear , while the low - redshift universe is in a non - linear regime .",
    "it is now well established that cmb temperature anisotropies are genuine imprint of the early universe , which could potentially be used to determine to a high precision virtually all cosmological parameters of interest .",
    "it has been estimated that a number of cosmological parameters can be determined with standard errors of @xmath0 or better by the upcoming nasa map satellite  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the future planck surveyor cmb mission would have capability of observing the early universe about 100 times better than map .    at this point",
    ", we should explore as much information as possible besides the temperature anisotropy contained in the relic photons .",
    "anisotropic radiation possessing a non - zero quadrupole moment acquires a net linear polarization when it is scattered with electrons via thomson scattering  @xcite ( also see eq .",
    "( 6 ) of ref .",
    "when the photons begin to decouple from the matter on the last scattering surface and develope a quadrupole anisotropy via sachs - wolfe effect  @xcite , linear polarization is created from scatterings with free electrons near the last scattering surface .",
    "studies have shown that on small angular scales the rms polarization , in a standard universe , is a few percents of the rms anisotropy , while the large - scale polarization is insignificant  @xcite . in models with early reionization ,",
    "the large - scale polarization is greatly enhanced , to a few percents level , but the small - scale anisotropy is suppressed significantly  @xcite . therefore , cmb polarization would provide a valuable complementary information to the anisotropy measurements .",
    "in addition , the anisotropy - polarization cross correlation offers a test of physics on the last scattering surface , as well as a possibility of distinguishing the scalar and tensor perturbations  @xcite .",
    "however , all of these polarization calculations have relied on a small - angle approximation , which may not be valid when a large sky - coverage is considered .    as such , full - sky analyses of the polarization have been performed   @xcite .",
    "it was found that there are modifications to low multipole moments ( @xmath1 ) of the polarization power spectra , where the tensor contribution dominates over the scalar contribution  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , rotationally invariant power spectra of the stokes parameters have been constructed  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "one of them is a parity - odd magnetic polarization spectrum , which vanishes for scalar - induced polarization , thereby allowing one to make a model - independent identification of non - scalar ( i.e. vector or tensor ) perturbations ( also see ref .",
    "recently it was shown that magnetic polarization would be a strong discriminator between defect and inflation models  @xcite .",
    "also , a new physically transparent formalism based on the total angular momentum representation  @xcite was proposed  @xcite , which simplifies the radiative transport problem and can be easily generalized to open universes  @xcite .",
    "since polarization fluctuations are typically at a part in a million , an order magnitude below the temperature fluctuations , to measure this signal requires high detector sensitivity , long integration time , and/or a large number of pixels .",
    "so far , only experimental upper limits have been obtained  @xcite , with the current limit on the linear polarization being @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "ground - based experiments being planned or built will probably achieve detection sensitivity using low - noise hemt amplifiers as well as long hours of integration time per pixel .",
    "the map satellite will launch in 2000 and make polarization measurements of the whole sky in about @xmath3 pixels .",
    "if the polarization foreground can be successfully removed , map should marginally reach the detection level . for",
    "a detection of the magnetic polarization one would require either several years of map observations or the planck mission  @xcite .",
    "we expect that polarization measurements are as important as anisotropy in future missions .",
    "previous full - sky studies of the polarization are mainly based on angular power spectrum estimators in fourier space .",
    "although electric- and magnetic - type scalar fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 in real space can be constructed , they must involve nonlocal derivatives of the stokes components .",
    "in this paper , we will study in detail the auto- and cross - correlation functions of the stokes parameters themselves in real space . although the two approaches should be equivalent to each other",

    "each parameter is a function of the photon propogation direction @xmath11 .",
    "let us define @xmath12 as the temperature fluctuation about the mean .",
    "since circular polarization can not be generated by thomson scattering alone , @xmath10 decouples from the other components .",

    "the expected s / n ratio of the rms polarization is @xmath175 for reionized scdm models with reionization redshifts @xmath189  @xcite , whereas the anisotropy - polarization correlation would be dominated by noise  @xcite .",
    "the most straightforward way to obtain the power spectra from the measured stokes parameters is to perform a maximum likelihood analysis of the data .",
    "all of the information in the measurement is encoded in the likelihood function , which can properly take into account non - uniform detector noise , and sample variances .",
    "this is particularly an advantage for ground - based experiments which track tens or hundreds of spots in the sky to measure @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the method offers a simple test of the consistency of the power spectra from map to map , and the correlation between maps .",
    "in fact , this method has been employed by the _",
    "cobe_/dmr to determine the anisotropy quadrupole normalization from the two - point functions of the 4-year anisotropy maps containing about 4000 pixels  @xcite .",
    "however , as is known , for all - sky coverage in satellite experiments , especially small - scale measurements , the large amount of data involved in the computation makes the analysis inefficient .",
    "this problem may be reduced by using filtering and compression as in the case of anisotropy data .    for a small number of measurements , such as the ongoing polarization experiment polar that measures @xmath8 and @xmath9 by observing an annulus of regular @xmath190 spots at constant declination  @xcite",
    ", the data set can be arranged as @xmath191 where @xmath192 . since all data points lie on a same latitude ,",
    "the expected theoretical correlation functions @xmath193 in this case are given respectively by eqs .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "thus we construct the likelihood function as @xmath200,\\ ] ] where the correlation matrix is @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the noise correlation matrix .",

    "the central value of @xmath210 in a confidence - level plot significantly deviated from zero would indicate the presence of tensor mode .",
    "it is known that the two - point correlation functions of the stokes parameters are explicitly dependent on coordinates .",
    "a way of getting rid of this is to expand the stokes parameters in terms of spin - weighted spherical harmonics , and to construct optimal angular power spectrum estimators .",
    "although being useful for all - sky coverage satellite experiments , it is not suitable for near - term , ground - based polarization experiments . for a small number of observation points , the simplest way to compare data with theory is to perform a likelihood analysis with a correlation function matrix",
    "further , a likelihood analysis of a full - sky map using correlation functions is a challenge for development of computational algorithms .",
    "several authors suggested to obtain coordinate - independent correlation functions by measuring @xmath8 and @xmath9 with respect to axes which are parallel and perpendicular to the great arc connecting the two points being correlated  @xcite .",
    "here we gave the most general calculation of the two - point correlation functions of the stokes parameters in terms of spin - weighted spherical harmonics , including the windowing function and instrumental noise .",
    "we obtained simple forms though they still explicitly depend on coordinates .",
    "however , the coordinate dependence can be eliminated by averaging over the whole sky , and the averaged correlation functions can be used to construct the covariance matrix in likelihood analysis of future cmb satellite data . moreover , in ground - based polarization experiments , if a correct scanning topology is selected , the coordinate - dependence can be eliminated or simplified in some way and the correlation functions can be directly put in the correlation matrix of the likelihood function .",
    "furthermore , we have calculated the signal to noise ratios from the two - point correlation functions for future anisotropy and polarization experiments .",
    "it is likely that map will detect the first anisotropy - polarization correlation signal .",
    "in fact , to complement the map measurement , a small - angle ground - based polarization experiment , targeting at a higher signal to noise for rms polarization , should be performed as to cross - correlate with the map high - precision anisotropy map .",
    "surely , measurements of the microwave sky by planck will push cosmology into a new epoch , as both cmb anisotropy and polarization can be precisely measured . on the other hand , the limit on sunyaev - zeldovich distortion of compton - y parameter , @xmath211 , from firas data  @xcite constrains the reionization redshift @xmath212  @xcite .",
    "this constraint is consistent with theoretical cdm model calculations  @xcite , which predict an occurrence of reionization at a redshift @xmath213 , and most likely at @xmath214 .",
    "so , it is probable that sport / iss would observe a polarization signal .",
    "however , if large - scale polarization is not detected , then it would be an impact on cosmological theories .",
