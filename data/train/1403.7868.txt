    "this is the second part of the study devoted to hypothesis testing problems in the case when the observations are inhomogeneous poisson processes .",
    "the first part was concerned with the regular ( smooth ) case @xcite , while this second part deals with non regular ( singular ) situations .",
    "we suppose that the intensity function of the observed inhomogeneous poisson process depends on the unknown parameter @xmath0 in a non regular way ( for example , the fisher information is infinite ) .",
    "the basic hypothesis is always simple ( @xmath1 ) and the alternative is one - sided composite ( @xmath2 ) . in the first part we studied the asymptotic behavior of the score function test ( sft ) , of the general likelihood ratio test ( glrt ) , of the wald test ( wt ) and of two bayes tests ( bt1 and bt2 ) .",
    "it was shown that the tests sft , glrt and wt are locally asymptotically uniformly most powerful . in the present work we study the asymptotic behavior of the glrt , wt , bt1 and bt2 in two non regular situations .",
    "more precisely , we study the tests when the intensity functions has a cusp - type singularity or a jump - type singularity . in both cases",
    "the fisher information is infinite .",
    "the local alternatives are obtained by the reparametrization @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "the rate of convergence @xmath5 depends on the type of singularity . in the cusp case @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the order of the cusp , and in the discontinuous case @xmath8 .",
    "our goal is to describe the choice of the thresholds and the behavior of the power functions as @xmath9 .",
    "the important difference between regular and singular cases is the absence of the criteria of optimality .",
    "this leads to a situation when the comparison of the power functions can be only done numerically .",
    "that is why we present the results of numerical simulations of the limit power functions and the comparison of them with the power functions with small and large volumes of observations ( small and large @xmath10 ) .",
    "recall that @xmath11 is an inhomogeneous poisson process with intensity function @xmath12 , @xmath13 , if @xmath14 and the increments of @xmath15 on disjoint intervals are independent and distributed according to the poisson law @xmath16 we suppose that the intensity function depends on some one - dimensional parameter , that is , @xmath17 .",
    "the basic hypothesis is simple : @xmath1 , while the alternative is one - sided composite : @xmath2 .",
    "the hypothesis testing problems for inhomogeneous poisson processes were studied by many authors ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "we consider the model of @xmath10 independent observations of an inhomogeneous poisson process : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , are poisson processes with @xmath21 we use here the same notations as in @xcite . in particular , @xmath0 is one - dimensional parameter and @xmath22 is the mathematical expectation in the case when the true value is @xmath23 .",
    "the intensity function is supposed to be separated from zero on @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the measures corresponding to poisson processes with different values of @xmath0 are equivalent and the likelihood function is defined by the equality @xmath25{\\rm d}t\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    in non - regular situations we do not have a laump test , and it is interesting to compare the power functions of different tests with the power function of the neyman - pearson test ( n - pt ) .",
    "let us recall the definition of the n - pt .",
    "suppose that we have two simple hypotheses @xmath26 and @xmath27 and our goal is to construct a test @xmath28 of size @xmath29 , that is , a test with given probability of the error of the first kind @xmath30 .",
    "as usually , the test @xmath28 is the probability to reject the hypothesis @xmath31 and , of course , to accept the hypothesis @xmath32 .",
    "let us denote the likelihood ratio statistic as @xmath33 then , by the neyman - pearson lemma @xcite , the n - pt is @xmath34 where the constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 are solutions of the equation @xmath37    in this work we consider the construction of the tests in the following hypothesis testing problem @xmath38 that is , we have a simple hypothesis against one - sided composite alternative .",
    "the log likelihood ratio function can be written as follows : @xmath39{\\rm d}t.\\ ] ]    the power function of a test @xmath40 is @xmath41 , @xmath2 .",
    "we denote @xmath42 the class of tests @xmath43 of asymptotic size @xmath44 : @xmath45 in this work we study several tests which belong to the class @xmath46 . to compare these tests by their power functions we consider , as usual , the approach of _ close _ or _ contiguous _ alternatives ( since for any fixed alternative the power functions of all tests converge to the same value @xmath47 ) .",
    "we put @xmath48 , where @xmath49 . here",
    "@xmath50 and the rate of convergence depends on the type of singularity of the intensity function .",
    "now the initial problem of hypothesis testing can be rewritten as follows : @xmath51    the considered tests are usually of the form @xmath52 where the constant @xmath53 is defined with the help of the limit random variable @xmath54 ( suppose that @xmath55 under hypothesis @xmath56 ) by @xmath57 if the limit random variable @xmath54 is continuous , and by @xmath58 if @xmath54 has distribution function with jumps",
    ".    the corresponding power function will be denoted @xmath59 and the comparison of the tests will be carried in terms of their limit power functions .",
    "we consider two different non regular models . in both of them",
    ", the intensity function @xmath60 is not differentiable and the fisher information is infinite .",
    "more precisely , we study the behavior of the tests in two situations . the first one is when the intensity function has a cusp - type singularity ( it is continuous but not differentiable ) , and the second one is when it has a jump - type singularity ( it is discontinuous ) . in both cases the intensity functions @xmath61 has no derivative at the point @xmath62 .",
    "note that these statistical models were already studied before in the problems of parameter estimation ( see  @xcite for the cusp - type singularity and  @xcite for discontinuous intensity function ) , so here we concentrate on the properties of the tests .",
    "the main tool is , of course , the limit behavior of the normalized likelihood ratio function , which was already established before in the mentioned works but in a slightly different settings .",
    "the proofs given in this work are mainly based on the results presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recall that in the non regular cases considered in this work we do not have a laump tests , and that is why a special attention is paid to numerical simulations of the limit power functions .",
    "suppose that the intensity function of the observed poison processes is @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is a known positive bounded function .    to study the local alternatives we introduce the normalizing function @xmath69,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the _ beta - function _ and @xmath71 is the _",
