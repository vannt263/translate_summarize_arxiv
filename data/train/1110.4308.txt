    "systems of cold atoms in optical lattices have provided a highly controllable testing ground for quantum many - body physics  @xcite .",
    "particularly , a transition from superfluid ( sf ) to mott - insulator ( mi ) has attracted much attention . the sf to mi transition",
    "can be induced by increasing the depth of the optical lattice potential , and has been experimentally realized in 1d  @xcite , 2d  @xcite , and 3d  @xcite .",
    "it has been established that a system of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice can be quantitatively described by the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model  @xcite , @xmath0 when the lattice is sufficiently deep , i.e. in the tight binding regime . here",
    "@xmath1 annihilates a boson at the lowest level localized on the @xmath2th site and @xmath3 is the number operator .",
    "the hopping energy @xmath4 corresponds to the overlap integral of two nearest - neighboring wannier orbitals , and decreases exponentially when the lattice depth increases .",
    "the onsite interaction energy @xmath5 increases algebraically with the lattice depth .",
    "there is another important parameter , the number of particles per site @xmath6 ( also called as filling factor ) that is implicit in eq .  ( [ eq : bhh ] ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath7 controls the ground state phase of the bh model .",
    "when @xmath8 , the sf phase is favored at any filling factors .",
    "when @xmath7 increases at an integer filling factor such that @xmath9 , quantum fluctuations drive the system to the mi phase .",
    "since the sf to mi transition is one of the most remarkable phenomena emerging in the bh model , many previous studies have made efforts to determine the transition point both numerically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite . especially , theorists have accurately calculated the ratio @xmath10 at the transition point for different filling factors and dimensionalities . in 2d and 3d ,",
    "quantum monte carlo simulations have provided @xmath10 at @xmath11  @xcite while the transition points at arbitrary filling factors have been calculated with use of the strong - coupling expansion ( sce ) techniques  @xcite . in 1d , @xmath10 has been determined at low filling factors , namely at @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath12  @xcite , using the quasi - exact numerical methods of density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite and time - evolving block decimation ( tebd )  @xcite . however , the transition points in the high filling region ( @xmath13 ) are yet to be obtained because of higher computational cost .",
    "difficulty in treating the high filling region stems also from the fact that sce fails to give an accurate transition point in 1d because the transition is of the berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the critical points of the sf to mi transition in 1d for arbitrary integer filling factors , including the region of very high filling factors in which the bh model is equivalent to the @xmath14 quantum rotor model  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the determination of the transition points in the quantum rotor regime is important in the sense that the quantum rotor model effectively describes a regular array of josephson junctions  @xcite and liquid @xmath15 absorbed in nanopores  @xcite . in order to locate the transition point ,",
    "one usually calculates static quantities such as the single - particle density matrix @xmath16 and the density - density correlation function @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , here we use a dynamic quantity , that is , energy splitting @xmath18 caused by tunneling between two states with macroscopically distinct currents ( or winding numbers )  @xcite . in our previous work  @xcite , we have shown that the region of high filling factors can be efficiently treated with tebd by imposing a lower bound for the occupation number at each site in addition to an upper bound .",
    "it has been also shown that the tunneling splitting can be accurately computed by means of tebd . using these prescriptions , we calculate @xmath18 to determine the transition points .",
    "we find that the transition point as a function of @xmath6 is well approximated by @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the dimensionality of the system ( e.g. @xmath21 for 1d ) , and the constants @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are numerically determined .",
    "we show that one can express @xmath25 also in 2d and 3d , which has been obtained in ref .",
    ", in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : critu ] ) with different values of the constants . given these results",
    ", one can immediately know the transition points for any filling factors and any realistic dimensions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the system and the model considered here and explain how to determine the transition point from the tunneling splitting .",
    "we qualitatively discuss the relation between the tunneling splitting and the sf to mi transition from a perspective of the instanton method . in sec .",
    "[ sec : xxz ] , in order to examine the performance of the suggested procedure , we apply it to the 1d hardcore bh model with nearest - neighbor interactions that is exactly solvable by means of the bethe ansatz . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ucvsnu ] , we calculate the transition point in the bh model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bhh ] ) as a function of the filling factor . in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] , we summarize the results .",
    "we consider a system of 1d lattice bosons in a ring - shaped geometry , i.e. with a periodic boundary .",
    "we assume for the moment that the system is in the sf phase . in the classical limit , which corresponds to the limit of @xmath26 in the bh model , a state with a finite homogeneous current",
    "can be metastable , and its quasimomentum per particle is discretized as @xmath27 , where the integer @xmath28 is the winding number , @xmath29 the number of lattice sites , and @xmath30 the lattice spacing .",
    "we suppose a situation that two states with different winding numbers , say @xmath31 and @xmath32 , are degenerate .",
    "we define the winding number difference between the two states @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "when @xmath35 is an integer and @xmath7 is finite , umklapp scattering processes can induce phase slips via quantum tunneling to couple these two states . as a result ,",
    "the degeneracy is broken and there emerges the energy splitting @xmath18 that quantifies the tunneling rate . applying the instanton techniques  @xcite to the phenomenological tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid model , kashurnikov _ et al .",
    "_  have derived the following scaling formula of the energy splitting at the smallest possible winding number difference @xmath33 with respect to @xmath29  @xcite , @xmath36 where the tl parameter @xmath37 is defined such that the effective action for the phase of the bosonic field @xmath38 is described as @xmath39.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath40 is the sound speed .",
    "it is well - known that the sf phase is favored when @xmath41 and that the sf to mi transition of the bkt type occurs at @xmath42  @xcite . at the transition point",
    ", the renormalization of the tl parameter leads to a logarithmic correction on the scaling of @xmath18 as  @xcite @xmath43 in the next section , we will see that the inclusion of the logarithmic correction is important to accurately calculate the transition point .",
    "given the scaling formulas of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : esp ] ) and ( [ eq : esplog ] ) , one can determine the transition point from the energy splitting as follows .",
    "first , using tebd , we numerically compute @xmath18 as a function of @xmath29 in the way described in ref .  .",
    "we next fit a function @xmath44 to the numerical data , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are free parameters , and extract the exponent @xmath46 .",
    "we determine the transition point from the condition that @xmath47 .",
    "let us explain a reason why the exponent @xmath46 is equal to unity at the transition point from a different viewpoint , which is the relation between the sf to mi transition and the validity of the instanton formula of eq .",
    "( [ eq : esp ] ) .",
    "an important point is that the instanton techniques used to derive eq .",
    "( [ eq : esp ] ) are based on the so - called dilute gas approximation ( dga ) , in which the instantons are assumed to be well separated from each other in the path - integral trajectories that contribute to the partition function  @xcite . in our system of 1d lattice bosons , since an instanton is regarded as a vortex in the space - time plane , the breakdown of dga means that many vortices are created in the space - time coordinate so that they destroy the long - range coherence of bosonic phases , leading to the quantum phase transition to the mott insulator . in short",
    ", the breakdown of dga signals the mott transition  @xcite . in general",
    ", the condition under which the dilute gas approximation is valid is that the size of an instanton along the imaginary - time axis @xmath48 is much smaller than the tunneling time @xmath49 . in the present case ,",
    "since the winding number difference @xmath50 is of the order of unity , the instanton size is of the order of the system size , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath18 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : esp ] ) . obviously , when @xmath52 , the condition that @xmath53 is held in the thermodynamics limit such that dga is valid , i.e.  the system is in the sf phase .",
    "thus , the condition for the mott transition is given by @xmath47 .",
    "in this section , we analyze the 1d hardcore bh model with the nearest - neighbor interactions , @xmath54 in order to illustrate that the critical point of the 1d superfluid to insulator transition can be accurately calculated along the procedure described in the previous section . here , @xmath55 is the nearest - neighbor interaction , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the creation and number operators of a hardcore boson at site @xmath2 .",
    "we also include the phase twist @xmath58 in the hopping term in order to control the winding number of states .",
    "the hardcore constraint means that the maximum occupation number at each site is unity .",
    "this constraint leads to the identities between the operators of hardcore bosons and those of @xmath59-spins , namely @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which tell us that the model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcbhh ] ) is equivalent to the spin-@xmath59 xxz model and is exactly solvable by means of the bethe ansatz  @xcite .",
    "according to the exact solution , there is a quantum phase transition between the sf and the density - wave insulator at half filling due to the competition between @xmath55 and @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath62 , the particles favor to be delocalized and the system is in the sf phase . when @xmath63 increases , the umklapp scattering tends to localize the particles , and the transition to the insulating state occurs at @xmath64 . in the following , we show that our procedure provides a numerical value of the transition point that is very close to the exact one .",

    "we use tebd for a periodic boundary condition  @xcite . taking the state with @xmath73",
    "as the initial state and setting @xmath74 , we next carry out the real - time evolution . since two states with @xmath73 and @xmath75 are degenerate when @xmath76 , it is expected that the supercurrent dynamics exhibit a coherent oscillation between these two states induced by quantum tunneling . to demonstrate this",
    ", we calculate the time evolution of the current velocity given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the total number of particles . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vel ] , @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath79 is shown .",

    "we emphasize that our procedure provides an accurate value of the transition point even when the system size is relatively small .",
    "for instance , when we take the number of lattice sites up to @xmath101 for the fitting of the energy splitting , we find that @xmath102 and that the relative error is still within @xmath103 .",
