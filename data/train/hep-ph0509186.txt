    "effective field theory ( eft ) has become a powerful tool in the description of the strong interactions at low energies .",
    "the central idea is due to weinberg:@xcite `` ... if one writes down the most general possible lagrangian , including all terms consistent with assumed symmetry principles , and then calculates matrix elements with this lagrangian to any given order of perturbation theory , the result will simply be the most general possible s  matrix consistent with analyticity , perturbative unitarity , cluster decomposition and the assumed symmetry principles . ''",
    "the application of these ideas to the interactions among the goldstone bosons of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd is referred to as ( mesonic ) chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite and has been highly successful ( see , e.g. , ref .   for a pedagogical introduction ) .",
    "besides the most general lagrangian a successful eft program requires a consistent power counting scheme to assess the importance of a given ( renormalized ) diagram . in the following",
    "we will outline some recent developments in devising a renormalization scheme leading to a simple and consistent power counting for the renormalized diagrams of a manifestly lorentz - invariant approach to baryon chpt .",
    "the standard effective lagrangian relevant to the single - nucleon sector consists of the sum of the purely mesonic and @xmath0 lagrangians , respectively,@xcite @xmath1 which are organized in a derivative and quark - mass expansion .",
    "the aim is to devise a renormalization procedure generating , after renormalization , the following power counting : a loop integration in @xmath2 dimensions counts as @xmath3 , pion and fermion propagators count as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , vertices derived from @xmath6 and @xmath7 count as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath10 generically denotes a small expansion parameter such as , e.g. , the pion mass .    in order to illustrate the issue of power counting",
    ", we consider as an example the one - loop contribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : nucleonselfenergypionloop ] to the nucleon self - energy .",
    "after renormalization , we would like to have the order @xmath11 the application of the @xmath12 renormalization scheme of chpt @xcite  indicated by `` r''yields @xmath13= { \\cal o}(q^2),\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the lowest - order expression for the squared pion mass .",
    "the @xmath12-renormalized result does not produce the desired low - energy behavior which has widely been interpreted as the absence of a systematic power counting in the relativistic formulation of chpt .",
    "recently , several methods have been suggested to obtain a consistent power counting in a manifestly lorentz - invariant approach .",
    "we will illustrate the ideas in terms of the integral @xmath15[k^2+i0^+]},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a small quantity . applying the dimensional counting analysis of ref .",
    ", the result of the integration is of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are hypergeometric functions and are analytic in @xmath20 for any @xmath2 .    in the infrared regularization of becher and leutwyler@xcite one makes use of the feynman parametrization @xmath21 ^ 2}\\ ] ] with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting integral over the feynman parameter @xmath24 is then rewritten as @xmath25 where the first , so - called infrared ( singular ) integral satisfies the power counting , while the remainder violates power counting but turns out to be regular and can thus be absorbed in counterterms .",
    "the central idea of the extended on - mass - shell ( eoms ) scheme@xcite consists of performing additional subtractions beyond the @xmath12 scheme .",
    "since the terms violating the power counting are analytic in small quantities , they can be absorbed by counterterm contributions . in the present case",
    ", we want the ( renormalized ) integral to be of the order @xmath26 . to that end one",
    "first expands the integrand in small quantities and subtracts those ( integrated ) terms whose order is smaller than suggested by the power counting .",
    "the corresponding subtraction term reads @xmath27[k^2+i0^+]}\\right|_{p^2=m^2}\\ ] ] and the renormalized integral is written as @xmath28 as @xmath29 .      using a suitable renormalization condition one obtains a consistent power counting in manifestly lorentz - invariant baryon chiral perturbation theory including , e.g. , vector mesons@xcite or the @xmath30 resonance@xcite as explicit degrees of freedom .",
    "we have formulated the infrared regularization of becher and leutwyler@xcite in a form analogous to the eoms renormalization.@xcite    using a toy model we have explicitly demonstrated the application of both infrared and extended on - mass - shell renormalization schemes to multiloop diagrams by considering as an example a two - loop self - energy diagram.@xcite in both cases the renormalized diagrams satisfy a straightforward power counting .",
    "the eoms scheme has been applied in several calculations such as the chiral expansion of the nucleon mass , the pion - nucleon sigma term , and the scalar form factor,@xcite the masses of the ground - state baryon octet,@xcite and the nucleon electromagnetic form factors.@xcite figure [ g_neu ] shows the sachs form factors of the nucleon in manifestly lorentz - invariant chiral perturbation theory at @xmath31 including vector mesons as explicit degrees of freedom.@xcite one of the most recent applications has been the derivation of consistency conditions among the renormalized parameters of the most general eft lagrangian.@xcite for example , requiring the consistency of effective field theory with respect to renormalization results in constraints such as , e.g. , the universal @xmath32 coupling .",
    "moreover , similar constraints for the qed of vector mesons predict the gyromagnetic ratio of the @xmath33 and the mass difference @xmath34 mev at tree order .",
