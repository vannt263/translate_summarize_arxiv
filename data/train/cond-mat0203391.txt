    "electronic transport properties in quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) wires have gained much attention , not only due to scientific interest but also due to practical applications @xcite . when an electron is restricted to a wire , confinement subbands",
    "are formed due to quantization of the transverse momentum . in clean straight wires without impurities the modes of the subbands decouple , which results in a perfectly quantized conductance . however , the modes ( including evanescent ones ) mix when impurities are introduced into the wire , and the transport properties show a rich and non - trivial behavior",
    ". detailed aspects of the mixing have been extensively investigated @xcite .",
    "the impurities put into the wire usually give rise to bound states , which can be separated into two categories : true bound states with real energy and _ quasibound _ states with complex energy .",
    "the imaginary part determines the decay rate of the quasibound state .    even in simple 1d scattering problems quasibound states are quite common , for example resonant transmission states through a double barrier @xcite and ramsauer - like resonances",
    "@xcite in potential wells .",
    "according to the breit - wigner theory @xcite , for each quasibound state the transmission amplitude possesses a pole in the complex energy plane . in multichannel scattering problems",
    "another kind of quasibound states can appear ; the fano type resonance originally proposed to explain autoionization in atomic physics @xcite .",
    "when a discrete energy level interferes with a continuum of states , the excitation spectra become asymmetric .",
    "each subband mode in a quasi-1d wire gives rise to a zero - pole pair of transmission in the complex energy plane , where the zero occurs on the real energy axis . as a consequence ,",
    "there exist transmission zeros , and the zero - pole pairs lead to asymmetric resonance features @xcite .    transport through a time - dependent ( mostly periodically oscillating ) potential is also a subject of increasing importance , with a growing number of applications @xcite .",
    "one of the important features here is that an oscillating potential can transfer an incoming electron of energy @xmath0 with finite probability to ` floquet ' sidebands at @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an integer and @xmath3 is the angular frequency of the oscillation .",
    "even though this corresponds to an inelastic scattering , the process is coherent and non - dissipative .",
    "hence , it can still be regarded as a multichannel scattering problem like in the quasi-1d case , with the sidebands being analogous to the subbands . however , from the physical point of view , the fano type quasibound states of the periodically oscillating impurity are somewhat different from those of quasi-1d system @xcite .",
    "if a bound state exists due to an attractive static potential added to the oscillating potential , electrons in the incident channel can emit photons and drop to the bound state , and similarly electrons in the bound state can absorb photons and jump to the incident channel .",
    "a transmission resonance takes place when the energy difference between the incident channel and the bound state is equal to the energy of one or more photons of the oscillating potential . even without bound states transmission resonances like these can occur .",
    "the multichannel subbands in the quasi-1d case and the floquet sidebands in the oscillating potential case divide the complex energy plane into sub - domains with appropriate boundary conditions for the quasibound states . upon varying an external parameter such as the strength of the impurity potential , the quasibound states change their location in complex energy plane . in the literature",
    "@xcite it was claimed for the oscillating impurity that the quasibound state vanishes when the transmission zero collides with the sub - domain boundary and disappears .",
    "however , as we will demonstrate , the transmission line shape , the friedel sum rule , and the delay time show that _ the quasibound states do not disappear abruptly_. this clarifies the relation between threshold behavior of transmission resonances , and quasibound states and their boundary conditions in the general context of multichannel scatterings .    in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly summarize our findings about the transmission resonances and quasibound states . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the characteristics of quasibound states in the scattering problem with a 1d oscillating delta - function impurity , and discuss friedel sum rule and wigner delay time . in sec .",
    "iv , we study our second example , the scattering from a static delta - function impurity in a quasi-1d wire .",

    ", a scattered wave can be produced even if no incident wave is present .",

    "the poles can also be found by solving the wave equation with the appropriate boundary conditions of only outgoing waves .",

    "the choice of sign for propagating states corresponds to the choice of the _ negative _ sign for @xmath24 ( i.e. , the positive sign for @xmath23 ) , and follows from the propagating direction of the plane wave far from the scatterer . for evanescent states",
    "the _ positive _ sign for @xmath24 must be chosen in order to avoid divergence of the solution in space .",
    "it is worth noting that the ` @xmath29 ' sign corresponds to the decaying wave @xmath30 ) while the ` @xmath31 ' sign corresponds to the diverging wave @xmath32 ) , with @xmath33 .",
    "the physical reason of the exponential divergence of the channels with positive real energy is a retardation effect ; the wave at @xmath34 has propagated away from the impurity where it originated at a time @xmath35 in the past , where @xmath36 is the velocity of the wave .",
    "however , at that earlier time the amplitude of the wave at the impurity was larger by a factor @xmath37 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath38 since @xmath39 @xcite .    for multichannel scattering the wave numbers",
    "are given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the quantized energy of a transverse mode in the quasi-1d case ( @xmath42 ) and is equal to @xmath43 in the 1d oscillating potential case ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we order the @xmath41 s by magnitude and denote by @xmath45 the special value of @xmath2 which satisfies @xmath46 .    in order to satisfy the physical conditions for the signs of @xmath47 s mentioned above , for @xmath48 the ` @xmath31 ' sign should be chosen for im@xmath47 , and for @xmath49 the ` @xmath29 ' sign , which corresponds to the selection of a certain riemann sheet for evaluating the complex square root function .",
    "this choice of the signs will be called _ proper riemann sheet _ since this set of signs corresponds to the correct analytical continuation from the real energy axis . in order to represent the riemann sheet through the signs of im@xmath17 like in our convention",
    ", the square root functions should have their branch cuts on the real axis starting from the branch points and extending to the positive infinity .",
    "in general the notion riemann sheet depends on the choice of a branch cut .",
    "however , this choice of the branch cut can not affect physical results , because it is only a way to label the projection of the riemann sheets onto the complex plane .",
    "we introduce a labeling for the riemann sheets by the vector of signs of the square root function . in this notation the proper riemann sheet",
    "is represented by ( @xmath50 ) , which implies ` @xmath31 ' for im@xmath51 , ` @xmath31 ' for im@xmath52 , ` @xmath31 ' for im@xmath53 , ` @xmath29 ' for im@xmath54 , and ` @xmath29 ' for im@xmath55 , and @xmath56 has been used to indicate the sign of @xmath45 .",
    "we also call the regions of complex energies separated by the quantized energies @xmath41 s `` domains '' , e.g. @xmath57 represents the region with @xmath58 as shown in fig .  [ fig1](a ) .    as a parameter of the scattering potential such as its strength",

    "in fact the trajectory of the pole across the boundary is continuous and smooth once we use the same riemann sheet as the used one in @xmath59 , i.e. ( @xmath50 ) .",

    "let us emphasize that only the branch points , @xmath41 s , play an important role in the threshold behavior of transmission resonances , but not the placement of the cuts .",

    "the peak of the wigner delay time originating from the pole strongly overlaps with the divergent part of the background when it changes the direction .",
    "hence , for large @xmath164 the position of the peak no longer coincides with the energy of the pole .",
    "friedel phase and wigner delay time of the quasi-1d case behave similarly to the case of an oscillating impurity .",
    "we have investigated the characteristics of transmission resonances , friedel phases , and wigner delay times in multichannel scattering problems focusing on the trajectories of quasibound states in complex energy plane as a scattering strength is changed .",
    "subband thresholds divide the complex energy plane into sub - domains characterized by appropriate boundary conditions for the quasibound states .",
    "this set of boundary condition is related to the choice of the signs of the complex wave number @xmath47 in each subband .",
    "a transmission resonance ( or , a transmission zero ) can vanish when it collides with the subband boundary , which , however , does not mean that the pole becomes completely irrelevant , as is seen in the transmission line shape , the friedel phase , and the delay time .",
    "even if a quasibound state enters the neighboring domain , it can still affect physics at the real energies of the domain from which it originated .",
    "we illustrate these findings with two simple examples : the scattering problem with the 1d oscillating delta - function impurity and the static delta - function impurity in quasi-1d wire .",
    "we would like to thank ingrid rotter for a careful reading of our manuscript and helpful comments .",
