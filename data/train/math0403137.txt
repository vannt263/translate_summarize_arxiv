    "in fact there are different ways to implement the same construction , which differ according to how one chooses to order vertices in the tree , and the two common choices are the _ depth - first _ and the _ breadth - first _ orders . in section [ con - ptrees ]",

    "it is a curious feature of the convergence of approximating @xmath1-trees to @xmath12 that the rescaled discrete approximation process converges to @xmath95 for a topology which is weaker than the usual skorokhod topology . in the course of proving theorem [ t1 ]",

    "for any continuum tree with mass measure @xmath117 , we can define @xmath118 where the _ height _ @xmath119 of point @xmath120 is just its distance to the root . if @xmath121 then @xmath122 is the `` width '' or `` height profile '' of the tree ( analogous to the size of a particular generation in a branching process model ) .",
    "the time - changed function @xmath123 can be roughly interpreted as the width of the layer of the tree containing vertex @xmath124 , where vertices are labelled by @xmath0 $ ] in breadth - first order .",
    "parallel to ( but simpler than ) the proof of theorem [ t1 ] sketched above , we show that excursions coding @xmath1-trees using _ breadth - first _ order converge to @xmath83 , and agree asymptotically with the height profile ( sizes of successive generations ) of the @xmath1-tree . in other words    [ t2 ] let @xmath78 . for the icrt @xmath60 the width process @xmath125 exists , and @xmath126    qualitatively , in breadth - first traversal of the icrt ,",
    "when we encounter a hub at some @xmath127 we expect the time - changed width function @xmath128 to jump by an amount representing a `` local time '' measuring relative numbers of edges at that hub .",

    "the results of the present paper give the limit exploration process @xmath84 for more general sequences of @xmath1-trees , and to deduce convergence of the associated random @xmath1-mappings we need to understand how the continuum joyal functional acts on @xmath84 .",

    "fix @xmath183 and let @xmath646 such that @xmath783 then @xmath784 but by the same kind of argument as above , if @xmath785 , for @xmath11 large there must exist some @xmath531 with @xmath786 . by lemma [ l1 ]",
    "we then have also @xmath787 with high probability , so implies that the right - hand side in the last expression is @xmath788 for @xmath11 large .",

    "* theorem 1.1 ) , the process @xmath147 may be put in the form @xmath790 , where @xmath791 is a lvy process on @xmath792 and @xmath793 has exchangeable increments on @xmath0 $ ] and in a certain sense behaves less wildly than @xmath791 .",
    "precisely , @xmath791 has no drift , its gaussian part is @xmath794 and its lvy measure is @xmath795 , where @xmath796 is the dirac mass at @xmath797 . on the other hand , @xmath793 can be put in the form @xmath798 for some square - summable random family @xmath799 and a sequence @xmath800 of independent r.v.s with uniform law ( notice that @xmath791 and @xmath793 are by no means independent ) . then , writing @xmath801 and @xmath802 we have that @xmath803 which is what we mean by `` behaving less wildly '' .",
    "it is therefore reasonable that the problem on the finiteness of the integral @xmath804 , which is a problem dealing with the behavior at the left of the overall minimum of @xmath147 , should be replaced by a problem on the lvy process @xmath791 as soon as one can show that the overall minimum of @xmath147 is actually attained at a local minimum of @xmath791 , and such that locally @xmath793 is negligible compared to @xmath791 at this time .",
    "since @xmath791 has no negative jumps , the time - reversed process has no positive jumps , and such questions are addressed in bertoin @xcite and millar @xcite . pushing the intuition one step further , by analogy with the standard criterion for non - extinction of continuous - state branching processes and the analogy of icrt s and lvy trees mentioned above",
