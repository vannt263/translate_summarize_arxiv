    "therefore the signature system has no integer solutions on @xmath299 .",
    "therefore by proposition  [ homsign ] , if the signature system has integer solutions on a graph @xmath1 , then @xmath1 admits no homomorphism to @xmath299 , whence @xmath3 .",

    "the conguence generated by @xmath307 implies @xmath308 thus @xmath309 and @xmath310 are all congruent to the same element of order @xmath311 in @xmath272 . extending the argument to all triangles in @xmath1",
    ", we get that all the arcs @xmath312 and @xmath313 are congruent to the same element of order @xmath311 in @xmath272 and similarly all the arcs @xmath314 and @xmath315 are congruent to the same element of order @xmath311 in @xmath272 . now since @xmath270 contains @xmath316 , we get @xmath317 therefore @xmath318 , with all arcs congruent to the non - zero element .",

    "any odd cycle corresponds to a solution to the @xmath270-signature system on @xmath1 , so this system admits non - trivial solutions on @xmath1 .",

    "the @xmath270-signature constraint on @xmath299 is @xmath325 it is satisfied only when @xmath326 is even , and this is incompatible with the parity constraint .",

    "consider a system with an arbitrary set of such constraints , perhaps involving many different sets @xmath335 of valued graphs and many variables for each arc . if such a system is solvable on @xmath1 and @xmath1 admits a homomorphism to @xmath275 , then the system is solvable on @xmath275 .",
