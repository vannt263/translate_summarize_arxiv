    "dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) has been well - established as a powerful tool for treating correlated materials.@xcite at its heart is a local self - energy approximation that only becomes exact in the limit of infinite lattice coordination.@xcite in many applications to real materials,@xcite direct comparisons with experiment have shown the quality of this approximation to be very good .",
    "however , the interacting lattice fermion models to which dmft is applied typically have no known exact solution with which to fully compare .    although dmft was originally formulated for translationally - invariant problems , the local self - energy approximation can also be used in an inhomogeneous context .",
    "each inequivalent site in the system is mapped to a single - impurity anderson model in an effective medium that is determined self - consistently.@xcite this inhomogeneous ( or real - space ) dmft has been applied to a diverse range of systems , including materials with surfaces@xcite , layered heterostructures,@xcite atoms in optical traps,@xcite and even nanostructures or devices for molecular electronics.@xcite    inhomogeneous dmft has also been used to study depleted lattices.@xcite in the case of metals doped with randomly distributed magnetic impurities , the physics is dominated by effects of disorder ; while heavy fermion physics is recovered on approaching the periodic limit , where standard dmft applies . in the other limit of dilute impurities ,",
    "inhomogeneous dmft is exact by construction since the impurity effective medium is simply the clean host metal .",
    "the physics of dilute magnetic impurities is of course also well - known,@xcite with the impurity spin degrees of freedom being screened by surrounding conduction electrons by the kondo effect at low temperatures.@xcite models of single magnetic impurities can be solved exactly with the numerical renormalization group@xcite ( nrg ) , which provides access to thermodynamic and dynamic quantities on essentially any temperature or energy scale .    however , the physics of the intermediate regime with a few coupled quantum impurities is notoriously complex .",
    "already in the two - impurity case , there is a subtle competition between single - impurity kondo physics and through - host rkky coupling.@xcite theoretically , multi - impurity problems are inherently much more difficult to treat : @xmath0-impurity models generally involve @xmath0 coupled conduction electron channels . for nrg , the required computational resources scale exponentially with the number of channels .",
    "in fact , full dynamical properties of the two - impurity system have only recently been obtained with nrg for a true real - space system , taking into account details of the host lattice exactly.@xcite although the efficiency of nrg can be greatly enhanced by interleaving different wilson chains@xcite or exploiting large symmetries,@xcite it is clear that an exact solution for true many - impurity systems is beyond reach .",
    "similar difficulties afflict other numerical methods .",
    "coupled quantum dot devices@xcite and magnetic nanostructures or single - molecule junctions@xcite can also be described theoretically in terms of generalized quantum impurity problems .",
    "however , these systems typically contain many correlated ` impurity ' degrees of freedom ( and several effective screening channels ) , again essentially precluding an exact numerical treatment .",
    "inhomogeneous dmft is therefore a highly appealing approximate technique for such systems , since the computational complexity grows only linearly in the number of inequivalent interacting sites.@xcite however , details of geometry ( or molecular structure ) , inter - impurity coupling and rkky effects are important in these contexts .",
    "it is therefore not at all obvious what the quality of the local self - energy approximation is , since these systems are far from an infinite - coordination limit .    in this paper",
