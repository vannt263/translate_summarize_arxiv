    "stellar sources close enough to a massive central body will likely not be on simple keplerian orbit due to general relativistic effects .",
    "in particular , a periastron position shift will result in ( observable ) _ rosetta _ shaped orbits . since the amount of periastron advance strongly depends on the compactness of the central body , the detection of such an effect will give information about the nature of the central body itself .",
    "this could be exactly the case of stars orbiting close to the center of our galaxy , where a dark object \" is presumably hosted .",
    "all the literature concerning this topic considers the central body as a static schwarzschild black hole and a wide variety of related results as well as estimates for measurable shift effects can be found .",
    "however , general relativity contains other interesting exact solutions representing naked singularities or superposition of two or more axially symmetric bodies kept apart on stable configuration by gravitationally inert singular structures whose observational aspect have been poorly examined or often dismissed as representative of non - physical situations . on the other hand , singularities are somehow typical in general relativity and it is especially in order to better understand their role and their proper character in this quite simple class of solutions that the present paper has been conceived . in particular , together with the well known schwarzschild black hole solution one may consider the chazy - curzon solution which represents the static exterior gravitational field of a deformed mass endowed with a naked singularity at the particle position @xcite .",
    "analogously , for the rotating case , together with the well known kerr black hole solution one may consider the rotating chazy - curzon case .",
    "furthermore , due to a proper use of the weyl formalism , it is easy to extend the discussion including the superposition of two or more axially symmetric bodies ( in particular , two non - rotating chazy - curzon particles or schwarzschild black holes ) aligned along the @xmath1axis in a static configuration .",
    "these solutions are characterized by the occurrence of a conical singularity on the @xmath1axis , which can be thought as a strut \" , keeping the two bodies apart at a fixed distance ( see also the pioneering works of semerk , zellerin and @xmath2@xmath3ek @xcite which considered accretion disks or rings of astrophysical interest ) .",
    "the aim of the paper is to estimate the periastron shift of a star orbiting one of the above mentioned object and compare the results obtained . in doing so , we consider the s2-sgra@xmath0 binary system , hosted in the center of our galaxy , which is of special interest in view of future observations possibly revealing a periastron shift effect .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we introduce some static metric in weyl cylindrical coordinates : the single chazy - curzon particle , the single schwarzschild black hole , two chazy - curzon particles and two schwarzschild black holes , representing the gravitational field of a central body ( a single mass located at the origin of the coordinates , or two masses displaced along the @xmath1axis ) . in section 3",
    "we study the geodesic equations in such spacetimes in order to obtain a ( linearized ) expression for the periastron advance , up to the second order in a mass parameter associated to the central object ( which exactly coincides with the mass if the central object is a single body ; it is , instead , related to both the masses when the central object consists in a superposition of two bodies ) . in section 4",
    ", we extend our treatment to the stationary case of a kerr black hole as well as a rotating chazy - curzon particle .",
    "we apply our results to the case of s2-sgra@xmath0 binary system in section 5 , and in section 6 we address some conclusions .",

    "the linearity of that equation allows to find explicit solutions representing superpositions of two or more axially symmetric bodies . in general",

    "in this paper we have investigated the periastron position advance for various solutions belonging to the weyl class of vacuum axially symmetric solutions to the einstein field equations , namely those corresponding to a single chazy - curzon particle or schwarzschild black hole as well as a pair of them ( static ) , and to a single rotating chazy - curzon particle or kerr black hole ( stationary ) .",
    "although differences in the periastron shift among the considered solutions appear only at second order in the total mass @xmath78 of the central object , we have shown that the contribution of the second order term is appreciable with respect to the first order one , and can discriminate between the different configurations we have analyzed .",
    "our results are then applied to the physical system of the s2-sgra@xmath0 binary system at the galactic center .",
    "this research is particularly timely since within the next years it would be possible to definitely measure the periastron shift of the s2 star and therefore to univoquely determine , in principle , the nature of the dark object ( usually assumed to be a black hole ) hosted in the center of the galaxy .",
    "however , a caution is needed since we expect that the galactic center dark object is surrounded by a compact stellar cluster which may gravitationally interact with the orbiting star producing an additional periastron shift which is retrograde with respect to the pure periastron shift predicted by the general theory of relativity .",
    "the effects of the presence of a stellar cluster at the galactic center and the constraints that present observations can put on its parameters ( i.e. total mass , core radius and central matter density ) will be discussed elsewhere ."
