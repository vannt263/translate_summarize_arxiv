    "in qcd at high baryonic density , when asymptotic freedom implies that the interactions are weak , matter behaves as a color superconductor @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of cooper s theorem , as any attractive interaction occurring close to the fermi surface makes the system unstable to the formation of particle pairing . in qcd the attractive interaction",
    "is provided by one - gluon exchange between quarks in a color antisymmetric @xmath1 channel .    in the weak coupling regime",
    "it is possible to compute the value of the quark - quark condensate @xcite .",
    "the condensation process is dominated by the exchange of very soft magnetic gluons @xcite , which are dynamically screened by medium effects . a careful analysis of the gap equation , as arising from the schwinger - dyson equations ,",
    "was done in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the value of the gap was determined up to a constant of order one .",
    "the inclusion of the meissner effects in the gluon exchange processes introduces a slight correction to the value of the gap @xcite .",
    "the gap can also be computed directly from the scattering matrix , looking into the instability in the proper vertex function @xcite . from this approach ,",
    "the undetermined constant of the gap was computed .    in this article",
    "we study the gap equation when the one - loop fermion self - energy corrections are taken into account in the schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "the propagation properties of the quasiparticles in the dense medium are not the same as in vacuum .",
    "a more accurate computation of the gap necessarily needs to take into account this fact .",
    "one of the most relevant characteristics of the quasiparticles in the medium is that these have a finite lifetime @xcite .",
    "these quasiparticles scatter with the quarks inside the fermi sea , and they decay . in all the previous estimates of the color gap",
    "these effects have been ignored to leading order .",
    "what is the effect of a finite lifetime in the gap equation ?",
    "physically , one would expect that the decay of the quasiparticles will limit their efficiency to participate in the condensation process .",
    "for those quasiparticles whose lifetime is very short ( and this is the case for those who are far away from the fermi surface ) , their chance to participate in cooper pairing is rather small . taking properly into account the damping rate of the quasiparticles",
    "should then allow us to distinguish which are the modes which participate in the condensation .",
    "this should then provide a physical ultraviolet cutoff in the gap equation .",
    "this is actually the most relevant effect of including the damping rate in the gap equation for bcs superconductivity in weak coupling @xcite .",
    "here we want to estimate the lifetime effects in the framework of color superconductivity .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we write the schwinger - dyson equations of the superconducting phase of qcd in the general case when one - loop fermion self - energy corrections are not neglected .",
    "we will however neglect vertex corrections throughout our analysis .",
    "those equations are the generalization to color superconductivity of the equations that eliashberg considered for bcs superconductivity @xcite . in the most general case , these equations are very hard to solve .",
    "however , in weak coupling the one - loop fermion self - energies are the same , up to corrections of the order of the squared of the condensate , in the superconducting and normal phases of the system .",
    "therefore , one can include the one - loop self - energy corrections of the normal phase of the system in the schwinger - dyson equations . with this last approximation",
    ", the gap equation can be solved in an easier way . in section iii , and for purposes of comparison , we briefly review the computation of the gap in the free quasiparticle approximation of ref . @xcite .",
    "we will only consider the case of @xmath2 quark massless flavors throughout this article .",
    "a generalization of our results to a different number of quark flavors is rather straightforward . in section iv",
    ", we derive the gap equation when the one - loop self - energy corrections are included .",
    "we give a final expression of the gap equation written in terms of the one - loop spectral density of the quasiparticles at an arbitrary small value of the temperature @xmath3 . to evaluate the lifetime effects at @xmath4 , we model this spectral density by a lorentzian function .",
    "we then make a rough estimate of the correction to the value of the gap due to the inclusion of these lifetime effects .",
    "since the damping rate has a linear dependence on the quasiparticle energy @xcite , rather than quadratic as in bcs superconductivity , we then find that , to leading order , the effect of the damping rate in the gap is to reduce the effective coupling constant that the quasiparticles close to the fermi surface see through the condensation process .",

    "<S> . however , the quasiparticles in a plasma are characterized by having a finite lifetime . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we take into account this fact to evaluate its effect in the computation of the color gap . by first considering the schwinger - dyson equations in weak coupling , </S>",
    "<S> when one - loop self - energy corrections are included , a general gap equation is written in terms of the spectral densities of the quasiparticles . to evaluate lifetime effects , we then model the spectral density by a lorentzian function . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the decay of the quasiparticles limits their efficiency to condense . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the gap at the fermi surface is then reduced . to leading order </S>",
    "<S> , these lifetime effects can be taken into account by replacing the coupling constant of the gap equation by a reduced effective one .    </S>",
