    "flux values in physical units for astronomical objects are required to make comparisons to physical models ( e.g. kent et al .",
    "such comparisons are done regularly for observations at all astronomical distances ; from solar system objects to individual stars to nebulae to entire galaxies .",
    "the need for a more precise flux calibration has recently been highlighted by the fact that the uncertainties in the flux distribution of stellar standards are the dominant systematic error in measuring relative fluxes of redshifted supernovae ia s and , thus , in determining the nature of the dark energy that is driving the observed accelerating cosmic expansion ( sullivan et al . 2011 ) .",
    "a more detailed understanding of dark energy requires a precise and accurate comparison between the fluxes of distant and nearby supernovae in the rest frame .",
    "quantitative descriptions of dark energy in terms of the einstein equations of general relativity are significantly improved when the relative flux with wavelength is known to an accuracy of 1% or better ( aldering et al .",
    "proof of this primary justification for precise flux standards is the award of the 2011 nobel prize in physics for discovery of dark energy , which uses the sn ia technique for mapping the history of cosmic expansion .",
    "the study of circumstellar dust rings in the mid - infrared ( su et al .",
    "2006 ) provides a second example of the need for a more precise absolute flux calibration . in this case ,",
    "model atmosphere calculations provide the basis for absolute mid - ir stellar fluxes ; and more precise lab based absolute flux measurements of stellar standards are required to verify and improve the model atmospheres .",
    "the models are fit to the visible and near - infrared stellar seds , where there is little emission from the dust ; and the dust signature is the difference between the measured mid - ir flux and the fitted model .",
    "thus , the precision of the model flux distribution from the visible through the mid - ir is critical .",
    "our ability to measure stellar brightness has progressed from ancient times when the eye was the only detector , and the precision was about one magnitude , i.e. a factor of 2.512 .",
    "photographic film provided a somewhat more accurate brightness measures that improved again with bolometers and photomultiplier tubes in the 1950s and 1960s .",
    "today , the state - of - the - art of modern two - dimensional electronic detectors makes possible a precision of order 1% in the determination of the physical energy distributions of stars .",
    "the precision of laboratory reference standards has also improved to better than 1% in absolute physical flux ( brown et al .",
    "2006 ) ; but there are no recent results on comparison of modern lab standards to stars . currently , the best stellar flux standards are limited by the precision of model atmosphere calculations of pure hydrogen wd stars .",
    "( see section 3.2.3 . )    in principle , one non - variable star with a known spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is sufficient to establish flux distributions for all stars in the sky .",
    "ideally , a spectrophotometer located above any atmospheric absorption could measure the brightness of any star relative to the one standard candle , as long as dynamic range , linearity of response , and out - of - band stray light were not serious issues .",
    "deustua et al .",
    "( 2013 ) also review absolute flux calibrations but with a much broader brush that covers the entire electromagnetic spectrum from gamma waves to radio wavelengths .",
    "this work goes into greater detail on the restricted range of ultraviolet ( uv ) to mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) .",
    "section 2 reviews the propagation of point source stellar flux standards to absolute surface brightness of diffuse objects and details the mathematical basis of instrumental flux calibration .",
    "section 3 reviews attempts to establish the fluxes of a few stars relative to laboratory flux standards , while section 4 presents the methodology for using model atmosphere calculations for standard star seds .",
    "in particular , section 4 explains the use of pure hydrogen white dwarf ( wd ) models and _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) spectrophotometry to establish a set of uv / optical / near - ir flux standards , which are available in the calspec archive . in section 5 ,",
    "several other archives of stellar flux standards are reviewed ; and sample seds are compared to calspec standards .    the calspec database is the repository for the seds resulting from the work described in this review .",
    "included in calspec are the models for the three primary standard wds , which are nlte model atmosphere calculations as normalized to an absolute flux level defined by a reconciliation of physics - based visible and ir absolute measures . while seds from other sources appear in the calspec database , the most precise and internally consistent set of fluxes are hst spectrophotometry mainly from the stis and secondarily from the nicmos instruments that are calibrated with equally weighted observations of the three primary wds .",
    "estimates for ir fluxes from model atmosphere grids are often included with the stis and nicmos seds for wavelengths longward of the limits of those instruments .",
    "in principle , the generation of a network of stellar flux standards is just a simple matter of measuring the background - subtracted net signal @xmath1 in some units like electrons per second from the program star and @xmath2 from a primary standard of known flux f , where the same instrument is used for both stars and where f is at the same spectral resolution as the measurements .",
    "the flux @xmath3 of the program star is simply the ratio of the signals times the flux of the primary standard @xmath4 or @xmath5 where @xmath6 = @xmath7 / @xmath2 is the instrumental sensitivity .",
    "this simple case is for a stable instrumental configuration with a linear response .",
    "stability means that repeated observations produce the same response , while linearity implies that the count rate is directly proportional to the physical flux @xmath7 , i.e. the ratio of flux to count rate will be the same ratio of @xmath8 over the dynamic range of the system .",
    "there is no restriction on the entrance slit or extraction aperture as long as the same choice is made for both stars and the extracted count rate is repeatable for both stars",
    ". the measured count rate can be in a certain aperture radius for point source photometry or of a fixed height on the detector of an imaging spectrophotometer .",
    "the sensitivity @xmath6 is really more properly an inverse sensitivity , because a more sensitive instrument will have a higher count rate for a source of the same flux .",
    "one complication arises when the spectral resolutions of the flux standard differs from the unknown star .",
    "a common example is a standard star with a tabulated medium resolution sed . in the case of a spectrometer with a resolution that is lower than the tabulated resolution of the standard , the calibration @xmath6 as a function of wavelength",
    "is defined as the convolution of the known sed , @xmath7 , with the instrumental line - spread function , lsf , divided by the count rate spectrum , @xmath2 , of the standard convolved with the lsf of the standard star spectrum , which brings the numerator and denominator spectra of @xmath6 to the same resolution and enables a pixel - by - pixel division of @xmath7 by @xmath2 after resampling to the same wavelength scale .",
    "this procedure may fail for the case where a low resolution standard star sed must be bootstrapped to a calibration of a much higher resolution spectrometer where the sensitivity of the high resolution data changes significantly over the resolution element of the standard sed .",
    "for example , a single echelle order may have a variation in sensitivity by a factor of 10 or more over a wavelength range covered by only one or a few resolution elements of the flux standard .",
    "the calibration of high resolution spectroscopy is greatly simplified , whenever a high - fidelity , high - resolution model atmosphere calculation is available . for broadband photometry",
    ", the average flux of the standard over the bandpass must be calculated as detailed below , which is straightforward , if the spectral resolution is much better than the band width .",
    "other complications include non - linearity and changing instrumental response with time or temperature .",
    "for ccd detectors , charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) during readout is not perfect and degrades with time , especially in the presence of ionizing radiation which creates charge traps .",
    "a source near the readout amplifier will be brighter than when the same star is placed farther away , which creates a non - linearity that must be corrected in the flux calibration process .",
    "a common non - linearity for pulse counting detectors is coincidence of pulses at the higher count rates . degradation of optical surfaces and detector quantum efficiency over the long term must be tracked and accounted in the correction of observed response to a reference epoch .",
    "for example , figure  [ tchang ] shows the mean degradation for one uv mode of stis since its installation in the hst in 1997 , while anderson & bedin ( 2010 ) provide a good example of a cte correction .",
    "because cte and optical degradation both manifest as slow losses in sensitivity , separate calibration programs are required to isolate and quantify the two different effects .    in the next section , @xmath9 in electrons s@xmath10 represents the instrumental response corrected for all non - linearities , while corrections for temporal instabilities can be applied at any stage to the sensitivity , the count rate , or just the final fluxes .",
    "266 over the 20003000    range .",
    "black diamonds are for the center of the ccd detector , while the red diamonds are for the e1 position near the readout amp .",
    "the dashed lines through the data points are the piecewise linear fit to the changing sensitivity , as normalized to unity at the beginning of the mission .",
    "all data points are corrected for cte losses .",
    "there is a data gap of almost five years before stis was repaired by a servicing mission in 2009 .",
    "presumably , the small sensitivity increase at the beginning of the mission is caused by evaporation of contaminants from the optical surfaces .",

    "the integration is done in photon units ( @xmath17 ) , because uv / optical / nir detectors are generally photon detection devices , rather than total energy sensing bolometers , although bessell & murphy ( 2012 ) demonstrate that counting photons is equivalent to integrating the energy .",
    "some authors , ( e.g. cohen , et  al .",

    "for example for the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on hst , bohlin ( 2012 ) tabulates the fractional enclosed energy for isolated bright stellar images .",
    "source independent instrumental sensitivities @xmath6 are defined by dividing the mean flux by the detected electrons s@xmath10 , @xmath9 , in an infinite - radius aperture .",

    ".    the reconciliation of laboratory component throughputs versus the truth of standard stars is achieved by adjusting the normalization of the filter throughput or even by changing the quantum efficiency , qe , as function of wavelength for the detector or filter when sufficient information exists ( e.g. de marchi , et  al . 2004 , bohlin 2012 ) .",
    "thus , information about individual component throughputs , such as the telescope or detector qe , may be inferred when reconciling sensitivities for several filters with different central wavelengths .    to complement the above estimates of mean flux for stars imaged in a particular filter , an associated wavelength is often useful .",

    "i.e. the specific intensity or radiance @xmath38 , there are analogous equations for the instrumental calibrations , where @xmath39 is the size of a pixel in steradians or arcsec@xmath40 . if @xmath41 in electrons s@xmath10 represents the linearized instrumental response for the count rate per pixel in a region of diffuse surface brightness , then @xmath42 or in frequency units @xmath43 the calibration constants for the specific intensity calibration are related to those for point sources by @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath6 have either the @xmath46 or the @xmath47 subscript .",
    "the reason that @xmath6 for a point source and an infinite aperture is required can be visualized by the following gedenken experiment .",
    "consider a field of point source stars with flux @xmath7 at the same spacing as the pixel grid of the detector , which is observationally indistinguishable from a field of uniform surface brightness .",
    "the total count rate n over all pixels for one isolated star is @xmath48 , while the very same count rate n , but in each pixel , is recorded for the infinite field of point sources , because the contribution to the count rate at any distance for the isolated star is contributed equally by the star located at that same distance in the dense field .",
    "thus , only a division by the solid angle per pixel is required to convert the infinite aperture point source calibration to a diffuse source calibration .",
    "while diffuse source calibration is simple in principle , several practical considerations limit the precision .",
    "because the wings of the psf may cover a significant portion of the instrumental field - of - view , direct measurement of the signal in an infinite aperture suffers from inaccuracies in the flat - field correction and s / n issues in the far wings , even for a bright isolated star .",
    "alternatively , modeling of the psf is also fraught with difficulties in calculating the last few percent of the energy in the far wings , which arise from diffraction , atmospheric blurring , ghosting , scattered light , etc .",
    "sources such as galaxies with a diameter comparable to the psf size will require a different calibration coefficient ( equation 14 ) than for an infinite diffuse source such as the night sky or zodiacal background .",
    "such small objects require an effort to model the geometry of the source .      for the flux calibration of spectral data ,",
    "the equations are analogous to those for photometry but where the count rates , sensitivities , fluxes , and throughput @xmath14 are one - dimensional arrays ordered by increasing wavelength ( or frequency ) .",
    "the implicit assumption is that the instrumental sensitivity varies slowly enough across any pixel so that the sensitivity of that pixel is well represented by its average sensitivity .",

    "@xmath6 can be derived directly from an observation of a known flux standard @xmath7 divided by the observed count rate spectrum @xmath9 , where @xmath7 is binned to the resolution of the observed @xmath9 , as discussed above in section 2.1 . in practice",
    ", @xmath9 for an infinitely high extraction width is @xmath54 / @xmath55 , where the correction @xmath55 for @xmath54 from a spectral extraction @xmath21 pixels high is derived from high signal spectral images .",
    "a specific intensity calibration for spectra is analogous to equation  ( [ cdiff ] ) , except that the uniform source of surface brightness must be limited by a slit of width w in arcsec in the dispersion direction . @xmath56 where m is the plate scale ( /px ) in the direction perpendicular to the dispersion .",
    "direct comparisons between stars and laboratory flux standards , such as standard lamps , is complicated for ground - based telescopes by the need to place the lamp at sufficient distance from the telescope to simulate a point source and by the differential atmospheric absorption between the standard lamp and the star light .",
    "the use of standard , calibrated detectors as the basis for absolute fluxes is hampered by the faintness of the starlight and by the need to establish the throughput of a telescope plus detector system for a collimated , uniform beam that simulates stellar illumination . making these sorts of comparisons in the earth",
    "s atmosphere is further complicated by the need to know the atmospheric transmission as a function of wavelength and time .",
    "the remainder of this section summarizes attempts to establish stellar fluxes above the atmosphere with instrumentation that has been calibrated with respect to lab flux standards . whenever possible , these laboratory pedigreed results are compared with the hst / stis calspec , wd based fluxes , which are described in section 4 .      at far - uv wavelengths ,",
    "the atmospheric opacity is so large that any attempts to measure stellar fluxes must be done from above the atmosphere . even at balloon",
    "altitudes the absorption by oxygen is overwhelming below 2000   .",
    "thus , sounding rockets and satellites are the vehicles used in the far - uv .",
    "although observing times are only a few minutes , a sounding rocket has the advantage that the pre - flight calibration can be confirmed post - flight , as long as the contamination control for re - entry and landing is adequate .",

    "both the available lab standards and the instrumental techniques have improved over the last five decades , which suggests that a precision of 1% is currently possible .      at the university of wisconsin , an early sounding rocket program ( bless et al . 1976 ) provided stellar standards for the flux calibration of the orbiting astronomical observatory ( oao-2 ) . in the 13702920    wavelength range ,",
    "the known spectral energy distribution of 240  mev electrons in the wisconsin synchrotron storage ring established the sensitivity of the seven photometers that comprised the rocket payload .",
    "the absolute flux of the synchrotron beam was determined by basic physics and the number of circulating electrons .",
    "as the beam degraded from an initial strength of about 50 electrons , the electron count was determined by the incremental losses in signal strength .",
    "other factors entering the calculation were the transmission of the mgf@xmath58 window on the storage ring port and the geometry of the illumination .",
    "a complete recalibration was done after the flight and recovery of the payload .",
    "three stars , @xmath57 vir , @xmath59 uma , and @xmath57 leo , were observed ; and their measured fluxes were used to update the calibration of the spectrometer on oao-2 .",

    "the colorado program used a standard tungsten ribbon light source at the longer wavelengths ; but such a hot lamp drawing 38.722 amps must be operated in air to maintain proper convective cooling . a precision aperture in front of the tungsten ribbon defined an effective point source when the lamp was placed at a distance of 73  m from the flight spectrophotometer . however , this laboratory arrangement required a correction for the attenuation by the atmosphere ( strongylis & bohlin 1976 ) , which caused the uncertainty to increase toward shorter wavelengths .",

    "thus , the effects of the lines are also removed in figure  [ uncert ] .",
    "while figure  [ uncert ] suffices for simple minded estimates of the ensemble systematic uncertainty of the hst flux system , correlations of the errors over the wavelength range require the more comprehensive covariance matrix to fully characterize the uncertainties ( jeach 1985 ) .",

    "the likely systematic errors in the slope of our wd based flux system is the heavy solid line in figure  [ uncert ] or the covariance matrix wdcovar.fits . in order to get an estimate of the total systematic uncertainty at any wavelength ,",
    "the uncertainty relative to 5556    must be combined with the uncertainty in f(5556 ) for vega , which is 0.5% . since",
    "the covariance is a measure of the uncertainty @xmath101 , a value of @xmath102 must be added to every matrix element to convert the covariance from values relative to 5556    to total @xmath103 .",
    "our ensemble uncertainty estimates are applicable to instrumental flux measures when observations with equal weight for all three primary wds are utilized for the flux calibration . for the best transfer of the wd flux system to an instrumental calibration , the observational data set for the three primary wds should be robust enough to make statistical errors negligible , while spacing of the observations over the instrumental lifetime serves to reduce errors in accounting for any time dependent effects .    of course",
    ", the total uncertainty in the observed flux for a sparsely observed program star is the uncertainty in the particular observational data set combined with the ensemble systematic uncertainty . for example , the signal - to - noise , the broadband repeatability , and any non - linearities contribute to larger errors in the flux of any program star . see figure 1 of bohlin & gilliland ( 2004b ) for a discussion of statistical uncertainty for stis .    the new models for the hst wd standard stars helps explain part of the problem with the wd fluxes in comparison with the spitzer fluxes ( b11 ) .",

    "1992b , cohen et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the essense of this technique is to find a model from a published grid , e.g. castelli & kurucz ( 2004 , hereafter ck04 ) that fits the observed shorter wavelength fluxes so that the longer wavelength part of the model establishes the absolute ir fluxes of the standard star .",
    "this technique was used by bohlin & cohen ( 2008 ) for a stars and by b10 for g stars with a fitting technique in four parameters , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , the metallicity [ m / h ] , and the reddening e(b - v ) . with the switch to rauch nlte models to define the primary wd seds , the measured hst fluxes change slightly ; and new fits are required .",
    "table 2 includes the revised best fit parameters for the bohlin & cohen and b10 stars that now have both stis and nicmos spectrophotometry .",
    "additional new o , b , a , and g standards have only stis spectrophotometry .",
    "the fitting technique is modified to use chi - squared minimization rather than the previous minimization of the @xmath127 residuals .",
    "these stars are prime candidate jwst flux standards ; and their seds consisting of stis fluxes plus the modeled ir extensions are in the calspec database .    despite changes in the seds of the three prime reference standards , improved observational data for the model fitting , and improved fitting techniques ,",
    "the largest change in the modeled ir fluxes of bohlin & cohen or b10 is 3% at 30  for 1812095 , which corresponds to a change in @xmath89 from 8250  k to 7750  k. because the ir fluxes for g to a stars approach a rayleigh - jeans distribution , the fitted fluxes are robust and not a strong function of temperature .",
    "the reason for such large changes for 1812095 is that bohlin & cohen fitted only to the nicmos spectrophotometry , which has a short wavelength cutoff of 0.8  , while the new fit is constrained by new stis data down to 0.114  . for the g stars of b10 ,",
    "the original ir flux extrapolations differ typically by @xmath821% from the revised parametizations in table 2 , because stis data already existed for the b10 analysis .    just as for the three primary wds , the systematic errors of calculated model grids likely dominate the uncertainty in the extrapolated ir fluxes . for the g stars ,",
    "b10 compared results for marcs models ( gustafsson et al .",
    "2008 ) with the ck04 grid and found models from both grids that agree with the stis fluxes to @xmath00.5% at shorter wavelengths .",

    "recently , mszros et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have computed an expanded set of the kurucz atlas9 models with updated abundances .",
    "unfortunately , the wavelength grid is even sparser with only 333 points . a third independent model grid , an update of the ck04 models with good wavelength resolution , and an extension of the marcs grid beyond its current 20  limit are required to establish confidence in the ir flux distributions .",
    "shortward of 20  , the best - fit ck04 models agree with the best - fit marcs models to 1% for the g stars in broad continuum bands . combining this 1% with a 1% systematic uncertainty in the _ hst _ wd flux scale at the anchor point of the fits at 12  from figure  [ uncert ] results in an estimate of a possible systematic 2% uncertainty of the broadband ir fluxes of individual g stars near 20  with respect to the v band . at 20  ,",
    "this 2% uncertainty is less than the 3% uncertainty for wds from figure  [ uncert ] .    for the a stars ,",
    "a second independent model grid is needed , because the marcs models are limited to maximum temperatures of 8000  k. both the original cohen seds and the newer bohlin & cohen ( 2008 ) seds are extrapolations of the measured fluxes into the ir using models that are based on computer code which is traceable to r. kurucz .",
    "the best check on these ir fluxes of the a stars was from the two models provided by t. lanz at 9400  k and 8020  k. while the agreement of the lanz sed with ck04 is within 2% for the 9400  k model , the lanz sed is brighter than ck04 by 4% at 10  for the 8020  k model , which raises the question of the accuracy of model seds , in general .",
    "a new high resolution grid is currenty being produced by sz .",
    "mszros and should significantly improve the situation .",
    "cooler stars , such as k type , are often considered for extrapolating model seds to longer wavelengths .",
    "however , the extensive contribution of molecular line blanketing complicates the models , which suggests that hotter stars should be superior ir flux standards whenever the sed depends on model calculations .      in principle , a model atmosphere for any star can establish a primary standard sed , just as for the standard wds g191b2b , gd153 , and gd71 in section 3.2.1 above .",

    "is a challenging enterprise when the goal is an sed with 1% relative precision over a broad wavelength region .",

    "the true flux is @xmath015% above the 9400  k single temperature model . in the ir ,",
    "vega is also a poor standard , because a dust ring contributes significant flux starting near the k band at 2.2 , where absil et al .",

    "so , either the hot models are less precise than the cooler part of the ck04 grid ; or there is an instrumental problem such as a shorter wavelength light leak or contamination from a different spectral order that is significant for the hottest stars .",
    "the elevated plateau in the 1420  range is strong evidence for some sort of instrumental problem for the two hottest stars .",
    "\\b ) the scatter increases for the fainter stars , especially longward of 14  .",
    "thus , the best photometric comparison is below 14  for the six cooler stars .",
    "\\c ) for the a and g stars , calspec and the spitzer irs flux shortward of 14  agree to better than 3% , which suggest that neither estimate has systematic errors of more than @xmath03% in absolute flux .",
    "on the theoretical front , disparities in the nlte modeling is the largest limitation to the precision of the three primary wd flux standards .",
    "ideally , the pre - eminent developers of the modeling codes might confer and determine whether the discrepancies in seds calculated for the same @xmath89 and @xmath90 are caused by different input physics or numerical imprecisions .",
    "secondarily , the uncertainties on the derivation of @xmath89 and @xmath90 are a floor to the precision of the models ( dotted line in figure  [ moderr ] ) .",
    "perhaps , better data or improved analysis techniques could reduce this contribution of the systematic error budget of the fundamental wd models .",
    "experimentally , the nist laboratory reference standards that have sub - percent precision should be transferred to the stars .",
    "rocket or other space platforms provide the most straightforward path for implementation .",
    "however , the extensive programs to measure the temporal and wavelength variations of the atmospheric transmission in the visible and near - ir may well produce stellar standards with precise flux distributions at the top of the atmosphere . to verify the msx results in the mid - ir and",
    "extend the msx concept to other wavelengths , a new mission is needed with on - board , in - situ absolute flux sources like the msx ejected reference spheres .",
    "the success of these experimental programs would free the flux standards from the uncertainties of the theoretical model calculations .    in summary ,",
    "the current set of calspec stars are the best available stellar flux standards for the fuv to mid - ir , where the seds as a function of wavelength are based on nlte models atmospheres for the primary standard wd stars of table 1 . table 2 includes many of the secondary calspec standards .",

    "<S> the basic equations for quantitative spectrophotometry and photometry are explained in detail . </S>",
    "<S> several historical lab based flux calibrations are reviewed ; and the seds of stars in the major on - line astronomical databases are compared to the calspec reference standard spectrophotometry . </S>",
    "<S> there is good evidence that relative fluxes from the visible to the near - ir wavelength of @xmath02.5  are currently accurate to 1% for the primary reference standards ; and new comparisons with lab flux standards show promise for improving that precision . </S>"
