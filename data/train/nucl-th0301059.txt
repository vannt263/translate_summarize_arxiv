    "owing to the progress of experimental techniques , information concerning the excited states of light unstable nuclei has rapidly increased .",
    "recently , exotic clustering in the light unstable nuclei has become one of the attractive subjects in 3experimental and theoretical research . since",
    ", in light stable nuclei , it has already been known that clustering is one of the essential features of nuclear dynamics , not only in excited states , but also in ground states , it is natural to expect cluster features in light unstable nuclei .",
    "pioneering theoretical studies have suggested the development of cluster structures with a 2@xmath1 core in be and b isotopes @xcite . especially , highly excited states with developed cluster structures in @xmath4be and @xmath5be have been studied by microscopic calculations @xcite .    in the case of @xmath0be , the existence of cluster states was suggested in experimental measurements of the excited states @xcite . in recent experiments of @xmath3he+@xmath3he and @xmath6he+@xmath7he breakup reactions @xcite ,",
    "many new excited states were discovered above the threshold energies .",
    "some of the states are candidates of exotic cluster states , since the measured spin - parities of those excited states indicate a rotational band with a large moment of inertia .",
    "it is an interesting subject to investigate clustering aspects in @xmath0be .",
    "although the molecular states in @xmath0be were theoretically suggested with a potential model with he clusters @xcite , they have not yet been studied by microscopic calculations . in the recent investigations with the generator",
    "coordinate method of a coupled - channel two - body cluster model , using microscopic @xmath3he+@xmath3he and @xmath6he+@xmath7he wave functions , a strong mixing of both configurations was predicted @xcite .",
    "the ground and the low - lying states of @xmath0be present us with other attractive subjects concerning the vanishing of a neutron magic number , 8 .",
    "the vanishing of the neutron magic number is already known in a neighboring nucleus , @xmath5be .",
    "the vanishing in @xmath0be was predicted in the early theoretical works @xcite .",
    "the abnormal configurations(@xmath8 ) in the low - lying states were experimentally studied by @xmath4be@xmath9be reaction @xcite .",
    "the abnormal structure of the ground state was also suggested in the analyses of the beta - decay strength from the ground state of @xmath0be into @xmath0b @xcite .",
    "moreover , the vanishing in @xmath0be was supported by a recent measurement of the spin - parity for a low - lying @xmath10 state @xcite .",
    "a new low - lying @xmath11 state @xcite is also important to solve the inversion mechanism . in the recent theoretical studies ,",
    "the structure of low - lying states were microscopically described by a molecular - orbital model by n. itagaki et al .",
    "@xcite , and by a method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics by one of the authors ( y.k . ) @xcite .",
    "they were also discussed by f. m. nunes et al . within a three - body ( n+n+@xmath4be ) model with core excitation @xcite .",
    "our aim is to conduct systematic research of the structures of the ground and excited states of @xmath0be based on microscopic theoretical calculations while focusing on clustering aspects .",
    "first of all , we have studied the systematics of the level structures , including the experimentally observed excited states .",
    "we have searched for cluster and non - cluster states to solve the following problems concerning clustering aspects in @xmath0be .",
    "do their cluster structures appear in @xmath0be ?",
    "if they do appear , what are the characteristics of their structures in unstable nuclei compared with those of stable nuclei ?",
    "the roles of the valence nucleons in the cluster states are interesting problems .",
    "we have also investigated the mechanism of the development and breaking of clustering .",
    "the important point is that the theoretical approach should be free from model assumptions , such as the stability of the mean - field and the existence of inert cores or clusters , because we have to describe various structures covering developed cluster structures as well as shell - model - like structures in the ground and excited states .",
    "it is difficult to study developed clustering in excited states with such mean - field approaches as the traditional shell model and the hartree - fock model .",
    "the cluster structures of the excited states of @xmath12be and @xmath4be were successfully explained by cluster models @xcite while assuming a 2@xmath1 core and surrounding neutrons .",
    "however , we think that a description based on cluster models simplifying the system as a 2@xmath1 core with valence neutrons or 2-he clusters is not sufficient for a systematic investigation of @xmath0be because of many valence neutrons in the system . we have applied a theoretical approach of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) . the amd method has already proved to be a useful theoretical approach for the nuclear structure @xcite . within the amd framework",
    ", we do not need such model assumptions as inert cores , clusters , or axial symmetries , because the wave function of the nuclear system is written by slater determinants , where the spatial part of each single - particle wave function for a nucleon is expressed by a localized gaussian wave packet . due to the flexibility of the amd wave function",
    ", we successfully described the structure changes between shell - model - like states and cluster states as functions of the neutron number in light unstable nuclei . owing to progress in computational power ,",
    "it has become possible to study excited states by extended amd calculations .",
    "this method is based on variational calculation after spin - parity projection ( vap calculation ) within the framework of amd , which has already been confirmed to be powerful for studying the excited states of light nuclei , as shown in studies of the stable nucleus @xmath0c @xcite , and also unstable nuclei(@xmath4be and @xmath5be ) @xcite .",
    "the authors and their collaborators succeeded to describe various structures of the excited states and to reproduce many kinds of experimental data for nuclear structures of these nuclei with the amd method .    in the present work ,",
    "the structures of the ground and excited states of @xmath0be were analyzed by performing a variational calculation after spin - parity projection based on the amd method . in the next section ( sec .",
    "[ sec : formulation ] ) , we explain the formulation of amd for a study of the nuclear structure of excited states .",
    "the adopted effective interactions are explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : interaction ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present the calculated results concerning such observables as the energy levels , radii and @xmath13 decays as well as the @xmath14 and @xmath15 transitions compared with the experimental data . in the discussion(sec . [",
    "sec : discuss ] ) , the intrinsic structures and the rotational band structures are described .",
    "the single - particle behavior of the valence neutrons is analyzed .",
    "we discuss the systematics of the development of cluster states in be isotopes , which can be classified according to the neutron orbits surrounding the 2@xmath1 core .",
    "we investigate the inter - cluster motions between he clusters extracted from the obtained @xmath0be wave functions , and calculate the decay widths for the @xmath16he and @xmath17he channels by using the method of reduced width amplitudes .",
    "the formulation of amd for a nuclear structure study of ground and excited states is explained in @xcite . in particular , the formulation of the present calculations is same as that described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this section ,",
    "i briefly review the formulation .",
    "the wave function of a system is written by a superposition of the amd wave functions(@xmath18 ) .",
    "the amd wave function of a nucleus with a mass number @xmath19 is a slater determinant of gaussian wave packets .",
    "the @xmath20th single - particle wave function is a product of the spatial wave function , the intrinsic spin function and the iso - spin function .",
    "the spatial part is presented by variational complex parameters , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , which indicate the center of the gauusian wave packets .",
    "the orientation of the intrinsic spin part is expressed by a variational complex parameter @xmath24 , and the iso - spin function is fixed to be up(proton ) or down(neutron ) in the present calculations .",
    "thus , an amd wave function is expressed by a set of variational parameters , @xmath25 , which indicate the centers of gaussians of the spatial part and the spin orientations of the intrinsic spin part of the single - particle wave functions .",
    "when we consider a parity - eigen state projected from an amd wave function , the total wave function is written by two slater determinants . in the case of a total - angular - momentum eigen state ,",
    "the wave function of the state is represented by the integral of the rotated amd wave functions .",
    "the expectation values of a given tensor operator for the total - angular - momentum projected states are calculated by evaluating the integral with a sum over mesh points of the euler angles .    in principle",
    ", the total wave function can be a superposition of independent amd wave functions .",
    "we can make the superposition of the spin - parity projected amd wave functions ( @xmath26 ) as follows : @xmath27    we performed a variational calculation for a trial wave function to find the state which minimizes the energy of the system , @xmath28 by the method of frictional cooling , which is one of the imaginary time methods . regarding the frictional cooling method in amd , the reader is referred to two papers @xcite .    in order to obtain the wave function for the lowest @xmath29 state",
    ", we varied the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath24(@xmath31 ) to minimize the energy expectation value of a spin - parity projected amd wave function , @xmath32 , by using the frictional cooling method .",
    "that is to say , we performed energy variation after spin - parity projection(vap ) for an amd wave function .    with the vap calculation for the @xmath29 eigen state , @xmath33 , with an appropriate @xmath34",
    ", we obtained a set of parameters , @xmath35 , which presents the wave function of the first @xmath29 state . in order to search for the parameters @xmath36 of the @xmath37th @xmath29 state",
    ", the wave functions were superposed so as to be orthogonal to the lower states .",
    "the parameters @xmath38 for the @xmath37th @xmath29 state were provided by varying @xmath39 so as to minimize the energy of the wave function orthogonalized to the lower states .",
    "after the vap calculation of the @xmath40 states for various @xmath41 , @xmath37 and @xmath42 , we obtained the optimum intrinsic states , @xmath43 , which approximately describe the corresponding @xmath40 states . in order to obtain more precise wave functions , we superposed the spin - parity eigen wave functions projected from all of the obtained intrinsic states .",
    "namely , we determined the final wave functions for the @xmath44 states by simultaneously diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix , @xmath45 ) for all of the obtained intrinsic states , and to ( @xmath46 ) . compared with the experimental data , such as the energy levels and @xmath15 transitions , the expectation values were calculated with the final states after diagonalization",
    "the adopted interaction is the sum of the central force , the spin - orbit force and the coulomb force .",
    "the central force is chosen to be the mv1 force of case 3 @xcite , which contains a zero - range three - body force , @xmath47 , as a density - dependent term in addition to the two - body interaction , @xmath48 , of the modified volkov no.1 force .",
    "the spin - orbit force of the g3rs force @xcite is adopted .",
    "the structures of the excited states of @xmath0be were studied based on the vap calculation within the framework of amd . in this section , we present theoretical results , such as the energy levels , radii , and transitions ( @xmath13 , @xmath15 , @xmath14 and @xmath49 ) , while comparing them with the experimental data . a detailed analysis of the structures of the states is given in the next section .",
    "the adopted interaction parameters in the present work are those used in refs.@xcite , which reproduced the abnormal spin - parity 1/2@xmath50 of the ground state of @xmath5be .",
    "namely , the majorana , bartlett and heisenberg parameters in the central force are @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and the strength of the spin - orbit force is chosen to be @xmath53 mev .",
    "the width parameter ( @xmath54 ) was chosen to be 0.17 @xmath55 , which gave a minimum energy of @xmath0be in a simple amd calculation without the spin projection .",
    "the wave functions for the lowest @xmath29 states were obtained by the vap calculation of @xmath26 by choosing @xmath56= @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 . after obtaining the lowest states(@xmath74 ) , we calculated the second and third @xmath29 states ( @xmath11 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) with the vap calculation of the superposed wave functions orthogonal to the obtained lower @xmath29 states .",
    "the obtained amd wave functions are considered to approximately describe the intrinsic states of the corresponding @xmath44 states .",
    "the final wave functions of the @xmath44 states were determined by superposing the spin - parity eigen states projected from these obtained amd wave functions so as to simultaneously diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix and the norm matrix . in principle",
    ", the number of the superposed amd wave functions is 24 , which is the number of calculated levels . in the present calculations",
    ", we omitted several of them which are not important , just to save computational time .",
    "namely , we diagonalize the positive - parity(negative - parity ) states projected from 22(18 ) amd wave functions .",
    "the theoretical binding energy of @xmath0be was found to be 61.9 mev(60.4 mev ) after(before ) diagonalization , which underestimated the experimental value , 68.65 mev .",
    "we found that the binding could be improved by changing the majorana parameter ( @xmath81 ) of the interaction to a smaller value .",
    "for example , a theoretical value of 66.1 mev was obtained by using @xmath82 with a simple vap calculation before diagonalization .",
    "nevertheless , we adopted the parameter @xmath51 in the present work , because this value reproduces the parity inversion of @xmath5be @xcite , which should be important for describing the ground - state properties of the neighboring nucleus , @xmath0be .",
    "we checked that the change in the @xmath81 parameter has no significant effect on the excitation energies , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , of @xmath0be , at least .",
    "in fact , the calculated excitation energies of @xmath83 before diagonalization are 3.0 mev and 2.8 mev , in the cases of @xmath82 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the theoretical level scheme is shown in fig.[fig : be12sped ] .",
    "the calculations suggest that many excited states appear in the low - energy region .",
    "this is the first theoretical work which systematically reproduces the experimental energy levels of all the spin - assigned states , except for the @xmath10 state . by analyzing the intrinsic amd wave functions of the states",
    ", we can consider that there exist rotational bands ( @xmath85=@xmath86 , @xmath11 , @xmath75 and @xmath2 ) , which consist of the following states : \\{@xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 } , \\{@xmath11 , @xmath76 } , \\{@xmath75 , @xmath91 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 } and \\{@xmath2 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 } , respectively    the energy - spin systematics for positive - parity states with natural spins are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : be12rot ] .",
    "it is surprising that the newly observed levels , @xmath96 at 13.2 mev and @xmath97 at 16.1 mev @xcite , correspond well to the @xmath78 and @xmath79 states obtained in the present results .",
    "an interesting point is that these excited states belong not to the yrast band , @xmath98 , but to the new excited @xmath99 band with developed cluster structure .",
    "the theoretical results predict the existence of many positive - parity states belonging to the @xmath98 and @xmath100 bands in the lower energy region .",
    "even though @xmath0be has a neutron magic number of 8 , the calculated ground @xmath101 band has a large moment of inertia , because the band head @xmath86 state is not the ordinary state with a closed neutron @xmath102-shell , but an intruder state with a developed cluster structure .",
    "it has a prolate deformed structure , which is dominated by @xmath103-@xmath104 configurations , and reaches the band terminal at the @xmath90 state , because the @xmath105 state is the highest - spin state in the 2@xmath106 configurations . the third @xmath107 band ( @xmath99 )",
    "was found to be represented by other @xmath103-@xmath104 configurations than those in the @xmath98 band .",
    "the @xmath99 band has an extremely large moment of inertia because of a remarkably developed @xmath3he+@xmath3he clustering , and reaches the band terminal @xmath79 state accompanying the spin - alignment of nucleons in the high - spin region . on the other hand , the main components of the @xmath11 and @xmath76 states are of the @xmath108 configurations , with the closed neutron @xmath102-shell , and constitute the @xmath100 band .",
    "the band head @xmath11 state of this band , which was theoretically predicted to appear just above the intruder ground band by itagaki et al.@xcite and kanada - enyo et al .",
    "@xcite , was recently discovered in an observation of coincidence gamma rays by shimoura et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the theoretical excitation energy of the @xmath2 state is larger than the measured @xmath10 state at 2.68 mev @xcite . in spite of the overestimation of the excitation energy ,",
    "we regard this @xmath2 state in the @xmath109 as the @xmath10 state at 2.68 mev because of the large @xmath14 transition strength , as shown later . in order to improve the excitation energy of this @xmath10 state , it is important to take the mixing of the other configuration into account .",
    "for example , by mixing a @xmath10 state with @xmath110 , which is obtained at slightly higher energy than the @xmath10 state with @xmath109 in vap calculations , the @xmath2 state gains about 1 mev .",
    "another reason for the overestimation may be connected to the fact that the present interactions give a too small value for the effective energy difference between the @xmath111 and @xmath112 orbits , which was found in the calculations of @xmath5be in ref .",

    "= 0.49    = 0.49      the theoretical values of the root - mean - square radii of the density distributions of point - like nucleons , protons , and neutrons are listed in table [ tab : radii ] together with the experimental matter radius @xcite deduced from the reaction cross sections .",
    "because of deformations , the proton and neutron radii in the ground state are larger compared with those in the @xmath11 state . since the theoretical values concerning the difference @xmath113 between the proton and neutron radii are about 0.3 fm , @xmath0be is a candidate of the neutron skin nucleus .",
    "compared with the experimental data , the present result for @xmath86 is larger because the present parameter @xmath51 is considered to be too large to quantitatively reproduce the radii of @xmath102-shell nuclei .",

    "[ fig : rdens ] . in both the @xmath86 and @xmath11 states ,",
    "the excess neutrons enhance the neutron density in the surface region . in the @xmath86 state , due to cluster development , the proton density increases in the surface region while it decreases at the center of the nucleus .",
    "it should be noted that , even if a nucleus has a neutron halo ( the long tail of the neutron density in the outer region ) , the details of the halo structure are not expressed in the present model space because of a limitation of the gaussian forms in amd wave functions .    .",

    "we studied the structures of the ground and excited states of @xmath0be based on the framework of the amd method .",
    "this was the first microscopic calculation which systematically reproduced the energy levels of all of the spin - assigned states in @xmath0be , except for the @xmath10 state .",
    "one of the present discoveries is the @xmath99 band with the @xmath3he+@xmath3he cluster structure , which corresponds well to the states recently observed in the he - he break - up reactions .",
    "the ground - state properties , such as the @xmath13-decay strength and the @xmath14 transition strength , were reproduced by the present calculations , which suggest that the ground state is dominated by a deformed intruder state with the developed cluster structure .",
    "the theoretical results predicted many low - lying excited states .",
    "it was found that most of them have a 2@xmath1 core , while the @xmath114 state has a no @xmath1-cluster structure .",
    "we analyzed the structures and the single - particle wave functions of the intrinsic states , and found rotational bands with @xmath115 , which are dominated by the @xmath116 , @xmath108 , @xmath117 , @xmath116 and @xmath116 configurations , respectively .",
    "the @xmath116 and @xmath117 states have deformed structures with a 2@xmath1 core . in the positive - parity orbits occupied by the valence neutrons",
    ", we found the molecular orbits , @xmath118-orbits and the new @xmath119-orbits .",
    "the positive - parity molecular orbits play an important role in the development of cluster structure .",
    "especially , the reason for the intruder ground state can be understood by the energy gain of the @xmath118-orbit in the developed cluster state .",
    "although the molecular orbits are helpful to understand the structures of the band head states , the model of the 2@xmath1 and 4 neutrons in the molecular orbits is too simple to describe all of the excited states , because such phenomena as the intrinsic spin alignment , the dissociation or breaking of 2@xmath1 core and the mixing of the molecular orbits appear in @xmath0be .",
    "we discussed the inter - cluster motions in the @xmath3he+@xmath3he and @xmath6he+@xmath7he channels , and estimated the partial width of these decay channels with the method of reduced width amplitudes .",
    "the analyzed results of the partial widths strongly suggest that the neutrons of the @xmath99 band move around either of two @xmath1 clusters , while the neutrons of the @xmath98 band move over the whole system .",
    "we also discussed the systematics of the cluster development in the neutron - rich be isotopes according to the classification of the states with the number of neutrons in the @xmath118-orbits . concerning the vanishing of the neutron magic number @xmath120 in",
    "the be isotopes , we suggested that the reason for the intruder ground states may be explained by the restoration of the natural distance between the 2 @xmath1 clusters .",

    "<S> the structures of the ground and excited states of @xmath0be were studied with antisymmetrized molecular dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state was found to be a state with a developed 2@xmath1 core with two neutrons occupying the intruder orbits . </S>",
    "<S> the energy levels of the newly measured spin - assigned states were described well , except for the @xmath2 state . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations indicated that many exotic cluster structures appear in the low - energy region . </S>",
    "<S> the widths concerning @xmath1 and @xmath3he decays were discussed by using reduced width amplitudes . </S>"
