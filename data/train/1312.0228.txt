    "in this paper , we study an @xmath0-component eulerian face - cubic ( efc ) model@xcite with partition sum @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an eulerian graph with @xmath5 bonds and @xmath6 clusters . the word ` eulerian ' means the number of bonds connected to each site must be even .",
    "a cluster is defined as an isolated site or a group of sites connected by the bonds .",
    "this model originates from the face - cubic model@xcite , of which the hamiltonian is @xmath7 .",
    "\\label{hfcb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath8 is an @xmath0-component cubic spin , with one and only one of the components has a nonzero value @xmath9 .",
    "this model obviously combines the degrees of freedom of the ising model and the @xmath0-state potts model , thus the hamiltonian can be alternatively written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the ising spin and the potts spin , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ fcb ] ) can be obtained by an graphical expansion of hamiltonian ( [ hfcb2 ] ) under a restriction @xmath13 , see refs .",
    "@xcite for details . in the expansion , the bond weight @xmath2 is related to the inverse temperature @xmath14 by @xmath15 .",
    "however , in the efc model ( [ fcb ] ) the bond weight @xmath2 is allowed to be larger than 1 , and @xmath0 can be any real value , instead of an integer .",
    "the face - cubic model has many applications , such as the adsorbed monolayers@xcite , the long polymer chains@xcite and so forth .",
    "the model has rich critical properties .",
    "a renormalization - group study@xcite of the face - cubic model goes back to 80th of last century . in two dimensions",
    ", the critical efc model belongs to the same universality class of the o(@xmath0 ) loop model@xcite for @xmath16 . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the model belongs to an universality class that is different to the o(2 ) loop model due to the marginally relevant cubic field@xcite . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the phase transition of the model becomes discontinuous . in three - dimensional simple cubic lattice ,",
    "the phase transition of the efc model is continuous and belongs to the o(@xmath0 ) loop universality class when @xmath19 with @xmath20 . for @xmath21 with @xmath22 ,",
    "it still undergoes a second - order transition that is in a different universality class . for @xmath23 with @xmath24",
    ", it displays a first - order phase transition at finite temperature @xmath25@xcite .    in two dimensions ,",
    "a two - to - one ising - spin representation of the configuration of the model is possible .",
    "concretely , the ising spins are located in the faces of the lattice ( or the vertices of the dual lattice ) , and two nearest - neighboring faces should take different signs if and only if the edge between them is occupied by a bond .",
    "basing on the ising - spin configurations , one can define magnetization and its binder ratio in order to investigate the critical properties of the model@xcite .",
    "furthermore the critical properties of the model can also be captured by the percolation of the ising clusters@xcite . in three dimensions ,",
    "the ising - spin representation is not applicable because of the different topology of space , but the critical properties can still be captured by the percolation of the clusters of the eulerian graph@xcite .    in current paper , we study the efc model in a region with bond weight @xmath1 .",
    "we find an ising - like phase transition for all @xmath0 . in two - dimensional square lattice ,",
    "such a phase transition is in fact an antiferromagnetic ising phase transition .",
    "its critical properties can be investigated by sampling a staggered magnetization and the corresponding binder ratio , based on the ising - spin representation .",
    "we further show that the critical properties of such a phase transition can also be captured by the percolation of the complement of the eulerian graph .",
    "this percolation game is repeated in three - dimensional simple cubic lattice , and a phase transition belongs to the three - dimensional ising universality class is found .",
    "for monte carlo simulation of the model , there are two efficient non - local algorithms can be selected .",
    "a cluster algorithm is given by deng .",
    "al_@xcite , which is also applicable for o(@xmath0 ) loop model .",
    "such an algorithm is based on the ising - spin representation of the configurations of the model , therefore it seems only applicable in two dimensions .",
    "in addition , for a two - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions , a configuration with a single loop wrapping the system ca nt be represented by the ising - spin configuration .",
    "this is not a severe problem because the critical property is not affected by the boundary conditions .",
    "however , if one want to study the model in the full state space , the worm algorithm@xcite is a good choice . in three dimensions , because the ising - spin representation is not applicable , the worm algorithm should be chosen .",
    "local algorithms , e.g. , the plaquette update@xcite , can also be used , but the simulation will severely suffer from critical slowing down .    the worm algorithm for the o(@xmath0 )",
    "loop model@xcite or the efc model can be combined with the coloring trick@xcite in order to avoid a connectivity - checking procedure , which is a nonlocal procedure for a basic updating step thus is very time - consuming .",
    "however , the coloring trick is applicable only for @xmath26 , and the algorithm with coloring trick will obviously suffer from the critical slowing down for large @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore we find that , for a worm algorithm with coloring trick , the frozen part of the clusters often makes it very difficult for a worm returning to the start point when the bond weight is much larger than 1 , which leads to a sharp reduce of the efficiency .",
    "such problem is severe even for @xmath0 close to 1 .",
    "therefore , in our simulations , the connectivity checking is still necessary .",
    "furthermore , one can use the simultaneous breadth - first connectivity checking@xcite to improve the efficiency .",
    "in two dimensions , the sampled variables are in two types .",
    "the first type is based on the ising - spin configurations .",
    "they are the staggered magnetization @xmath27 and its binder ratio @xmath28 , which are defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is @xmath31 with @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) the ising spin in the @xmath34-th face of the sublattice @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , and @xmath37 the number of total faces .",
    "such a definition of @xmath27 is similar to that of antiferromagnetic potts model@xcite .    by sampling the two variables",
    ", we expect to determine the critical point @xmath38 and two critical exponent @xmath39 and @xmath40 by the following finite - size scaling formulae@xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the linear size of the system , and @xmath43 is the dimension of the lattice .",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are unknown parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the correction - to - scaling exponents , which take negative values .",
    "( [ mfss ] ) is valid only at the critical point .",
    "the second type variables include the wrapping probability @xmath50 @xcite and the worm return time @xmath51 , which can also be used to determine the critical point and the two critical exponents by the following finite - size scaling formulae @xmath52 where ( [ taufss ] ) is valid only at the critical point .",
    "the wrapping probability is defined as the probability that there exists a cluster that spans the system and connects itself along at least one of the directions , which forms a nontrivial loop that wraps the system .",
    "obviously , such a definition is only applicable for a system with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "generally , @xmath50 can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of directions .",
    "@xmath55 is 1 ( 0 ) if there is a ( no ) cluster wraps the system along the @xmath56 direction , whether or not the cluster wraps along the other directions .",
    "for example , on the simple cubic lattice , @xmath56 usually takes the euclidean coordinate directions , thus @xmath57 , or @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the worm return time @xmath51 is defined as the number of updating attempts of the worm ( it is larger than the length of the worm ) , which is proven to have the similar critical behavior as the susceptibility@xcite .    in saying percolation",
    ", one should distinguish the ` complementary percolation ' from the ` normal percolation ' . in the efc model",
    ", each edge of the lattice has two states , linked or vacant . from now on ,",
    "an edge is considered to be occupied by a ` normal bond ' if the state is linked , otherwise it is considered to be occupied by a ` complementary bond ' .",
    "the percolation on the lattice can be defined basing on the ` normal bonds ' or the ` complementary bonds ' , which we call as ` normal percolation ' or ` complementary percolation ' respectively . for the normal percolation of the efc model",
    ", it has been studied both in two and three dimensions@xcite , in current paper , we mainly pay attention to the complementary percolation .",
    "in two dimensions , our simulations are mainly performed on the square lattice .",
    "our numerical procedure is illustrated by taking the @xmath60 efc model as an example .",
    "the largest system size that we reached is @xmath61 and each data point is obtained by the average of @xmath62 samples .",
    "the error bar is computed by dividing the data into @xmath63 bins .",
    "[ q ] is an illustrative plot of @xmath28 versus @xmath2 for various system sizes .",
    "the behavior of @xmath28 obviously indicates a phase transition at the critical point @xmath64 .",
    "a fit of the data near the critical point according to ( [ qfss ] ) gives @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the estimation of @xmath39 coincides with the exact value @xmath67 of the ising model@xcite , thus we expected the phase transition belongs to the ising universality class .",
    "this is confirmed by the numerical estimation of @xmath40 .",
    "extensive simulations are done at the critical point @xmath38 .",
    "the data of @xmath27 are shown in fig .",
    "we fit the data according to ( [ mfss ] ) and obtain @xmath68 , which is in good agreement with the exact result @xmath69@xcite .     versus the bond weight @xmath2 for the @xmath60 efc model on the square lattice .",

    "these results are in agreement with the fit of @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , the critical exponent @xmath40 can also be obtained from the fit of @xmath51 according to ( [ taufss ] ) , which gives @xmath72 .",

    "it is clear that the critical exponents for all @xmath0 coincide with the exact values of the ising model , namely the phase transition is in the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model .",

    "in conclusion , we have found a critical line of the @xmath0-component efc model on the square lattice and the simple cubic lattice in the region @xmath1 .",
    "the phase transition belongs to the ising universality class for all @xmath0 .",
    "here we discuss the nature of this phase transition .    for the face - cubic model in ( [ hfcb ] ) with a given value of @xmath0 , as the temperature @xmath75 decreases , the system undergoes a second - order phase transition at a finite temperature @xmath76 , below which the face - cubic symmetry is spontaneously broken and a long - range order develops for @xmath77 in two dimensions , although the transition belongs to the o(@xmath0 ) universality class and the cubic anisotropy is irrelevant for @xmath16 @xcite . in the language of the graphical model ( [ fcb ] ) ,",
    "an infinite cluster emerges at the critical point @xmath78 , which is actually the ( normal ) percolation threshold of clusters . for @xmath18",
    ", the transition line continues in the graphic model ( [ fcb ] ) while the corresponding coupling @xmath79 lies outside physical region@xcite .",
    "the cubic symmetry is expected to be broken when @xmath80 .",
    "the ising - like phase transition occurs in the region @xmath80 .",
    "since the cubic symmetry of the model has been broken for all @xmath0 , it suggests that @xmath0 no longer takes effect in the ising - like transition . to explore such an argument",
    ", we measure the specific - heat - like quantities , the fluctuation of bonds @xmath81 and the fluctuation of clusters @xmath82 , which are plotted in fig .",
    "[ cv ] and fig .",
    "[ cn ] respectively .",
    "it is shown that there are two peaks of @xmath83 but only one peak of @xmath84 .",
    "the peak of @xmath83 in the region @xmath25 corresponds to the threshold of the normal percolation of the eulerian graph , while the second peak corresponds to the threshold of the complementary percolation .",
    "the appearance of the peak of @xmath84 at the threshold of the normal percolation means the transition depends on @xmath0 , which interprets the fact that the critical exponents vary with @xmath0 at this point@xcite .",
    "the lack of second peak of @xmath84 at the threshold of the complementary percolation indicates that the transition is independent of parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this is also reflected by the fact that , by varying parameter @xmath0 , the critical point @xmath38 is only shifted by a small value , as shown in tables i and ii .     versus the bond weight @xmath2 for the @xmath60 efc model on the square lattice .",
    "]     versus the bond weight @xmath2 for the @xmath60 efc model on the square lattice .",
    "]    since the properties of the transition are independent of @xmath0 in the region @xmath85 , the universality class of the phase transition can be determined by an arbitrary @xmath0 , it is convenient to chose @xmath86 . on an eulerian lattice ( coordinate number is even ) such as the square lattice or the simple cubic lattice , a complementary graph of the efc model is also an eulerian one .",
    "this leads to a result that the complement of the @xmath86 efc model is also an @xmath86 efc model but with bond weight @xmath87 .",
    "therefore the complementary percolation transition of the eulerian graph must belong to the ising universality class .",
    "such a mapping also allows us to predict the critical point of the complementary percolation of the @xmath86 efc model on an eulerian lattice as @xmath88 on the square lattice , the threshold of the normal percolation of the @xmath86 efc model is @xmath89@xcite , it gives the threshold of the complementary percolation @xmath90 , which coincides with our numerical result @xmath91 ( table [ squaretab ] ) . on the simple cubic lattice ,",
    "the percolation threshold of the normal percolation of the @xmath86 efc model is @xmath92@xcite .",
    "this predicts the critical point of the complementary percolation @xmath93 , which is also verified by our numerical result ( table [ cubictab ] ) .    in two dimensions",
    ", the ising - like phase transition can be understood via the dual - spin representation of the efc model .",
    "for the square lattice , the symmetry of the odd - even sites in the dual lattice is broken when the cluster becomes dense enough at very large @xmath2 , which leads to an af pattern in the dual - spin configurations . an ising - like transition from a disorder phase to an af ordered phase",
    "thus presents independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the af pattern obviously depends on the lattice structure , thus the ising - like phase transition is lattice - dependent .",
    "for example on the honeycomb lattice in which the efc model is equivalent to the o(@xmath0 ) loop model due to the coordination number 3 , we ca nt find such an ising - like phase transition .",
    "there is only one peak of @xmath84 and the threshold of the complementary percolation coincides with that of the normal percolation , i.e. , the critical point @xmath94@xcite . for the simple cubic lattice ,",
    "the simple dual - spin picture is not applicable .",
    "we do not have a simple physical picture to interpret the ising - like behavior .",
    "it is not easy to predict the existence of such ising - like phase transition in a three - dimensional lattice .",
    "it must be studied case by case , especially for the lattice that is not eulerian .",
    "it is interesting to compare this ising transition with the recently studied ising - like transitions in the square o(@xmath0 ) loop model @xcite , in which the critical behaviors in the region @xmath18 and @xmath16 are different , although the critical lines connect at @xmath17 . in the spin language of the two models ,",
    "the low - temperature phase of the face - cubic model is ordered for all @xmath0 , but that of the loop model is critical in the sense that the spin - spin correlation decays algebraically for @xmath95 , and the o(@xmath0 ) critical line ends at @xmath17 . as a result of this fact ,",
    "the universality class of the ising - like transition in the o(@xmath0 ) loop model is a superposition of the low - temperature o(@xmath0 ) critical behavior and the ising behavior@xcite for @xmath96 , while for @xmath18 the transition resembles a hard - square lattice gas transition .",
