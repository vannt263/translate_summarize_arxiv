    "accretion discs involve approximately keplerian motion around a massive central object , and the general solution allows for nested orbits with smoothly varying inclination and eccentricity .",
    "the shape of a warped or eccentric disc evolves slowly under the action of stresses in the disc and external forces that deviate from that of a newtonian point mass .",
    "coherent precession of discs is usually possible in binary stars .",
    "warped and eccentric discs may be relevant to a wide variety of phenomena in x - ray binaries .",
    "long - period modulations such as superhumps and superorbital variability may be attributable to the precession of global warping or eccentric modes that are not forced but are excited by various instabilities .",
    "sufficiently large discs encounter a resonance at the location where the angular velocity of the disc is three times that of the binary orbit and may become eccentric as a result @xcite .",
    "this effect is well known in cataclysmic variable stars of mass ratio @xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where , as well as giving rise to superhumps , the eccentricity enhances the viscous dissipation and significantly affects the outburst dynamics .",
    "similar processes should occur in most x - ray binaries with black hole primaries , and indeed superhumps are reported in an increasing number of such systems @xcite .",
    "a warping instability involving radiation forces @xcite is more likely to occur with neutron star primaries @xcite but may also be seen in grs  1915 + 105 , which has a very large disc @xcite .",
    "stationary warped discs also arise whenever there is a misalignment between the orbital angular momentum of the binary and the spin angular momentum of the central object @xcite , a knowledge of which is communicated to the disc through general relativistic ( gravitomagnetic ) or magnetic torques @xcite .",
    "the innermost parts of discs around black holes and neutron stars depart significantly from keplerian motion .",
    "indeed , the rapid relativistic precession of elliptical or inclined orbits has often been discussed in connection with quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in x - ray binaries , and may best be studied within the context of eccentric or warped discs .",
    "there is an apparent conflict between the description of the outer part of the disc , which supports slowly precessing global deformations , and that of the non - keplerian inner region . in this paper",
    "we attempt to make this connection and to describe how a global deformation of the disc in the form of a stationary or slowly precessing warp or eccentricity may be able to propagate inwards under some conditions , activating the inner region and possibly exciting trapped oscillations that may explain high - frequency qpos in accreting black holes .",
    "the excitation mechanism itself has been studied by @xcite and by ( * ? ? ?",

    "a small warp or eccentricity can be considered as a perturbation of a standard ( circular and coplanar ) disc .",
    "such a disc supports a variety of wave modes , having a dependence on time and azimuth of the form @xmath1 . in the simplest case of a strictly isothermal disc , a local dispersion relation @xmath2",
    "can be derived @xcite , which relates the doppler - shifted wave frequency @xmath3 to the radial wavenumber @xmath4 .",
    "the integers @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the azimuthal and vertical mode numbers , while @xmath7 is the vertical scaleheight of the disc and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the orbital , epicyclic and vertical oscillation frequencies characteristic of circular orbits in the given potential or metric .",
    "all of these quantities depend on the radius @xmath11 at which the dispersion relation is evaluated .",
    "the local dispersion relation of a more general disc model can be calculated numerically .",
    "for this description to be accurate , the wavelength @xmath12 should be much less than @xmath11 .    within this context",
    ", a warp corresponds to @xmath13 ( vertical motion independent of @xmath14 ) and an eccentricity to @xmath15 ( horizontal motion independent of @xmath14 ) .",
    "the dispersion relation shows that the warp takes the form of a propagating bending wave ( @xmath16 ) when @xmath17 or @xmath18 , while the eccentricity takes the form of a propagating density wave when @xmath19 .",
    "a complementary description is provided by theories that consider a warp or eccentricity that varies on a length - scale much longer than @xmath7 and on a time - scale much longer than @xmath20 .",
    "small - amplitude warps are governed by the equations @xmath21={\\frac}{1}{r}{\\frac}{{\\partial}g}{{\\partial}r},\\ ] ] @xmath22 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath23 describes the amplitude and phase of the inclination of the disc at radius @xmath11 and time @xmath24 , @xmath25 refers to a horizontal torque communicated by reynolds stresses , @xmath26 is the surface density and @xmath27 is the vertically integrated pressure .",
    "these equations describe propagating bending waves with essentially the same local dispersion relation as in the previous section .",
    "( the theories overlap when @xmath28 , which is possible in a thin disc . )",
    "they also allow for viscous ( i.e.turbulent ) damping of the warp , parametrized using a dimensionless number @xmath29 , which is equivalent to the usual shakura ",

    "* ) , where @xmath31 describes the amplitude and phase of the eccentricity of the disc at radius @xmath11 and time @xmath24 , @xmath32 is the adiabatic exponent and @xmath33 parametrizes the viscous damping . for short wavelengths",
    ", this equation also agrees with the local dispersion relation of the isothermal disc when @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this equation is based on a two - dimensional approximation and neglects many of the complications of a shear viscosity such as viscous overstability @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated theories , including nonlinearity and all viscous or viscoelastic effects , are available in the literature @xcite .",
    "[ f : lambda ]    = 7.5cm=7.5 cm    a global warp or eccentricity precesses at only a fraction of the binary orbital frequency , so the wave frequency @xmath36 is completely negligible compared to @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the inner part of the disc . setting @xmath37 , we find the local radial wavenumber to be given by @xmath38 in the case of a warp and @xmath39 for an eccentricity .",
    "using the expressions for @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the kerr metric @xcite and taking @xmath40 , we find @xmath41 as a function of the dimensionless radius @xmath42 and the spin parameter @xmath43 ( see fig .",

    "propagate at all radii , with wavelengths everywhere significantly longer than @xmath7 .",
    "of all the wave modes described by the local dispersion relation , these are the most credible in a turbulent disc because of their relatively long wavelengths .",
    "it is also possible to predict how the amplitudes of the deformations scale with radius . in the absence of viscous",
    "damping , a wkb analysis of the secular theories shows that @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we apply these results to a steady accretion disc in the regime dominated by gas pressure and thomson opacity , in which ( assuming @xmath47 ) @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "then @xmath51 and @xmath52 , implying a very mild dependence of the amplitude on radius .",
    "however , the gradients @xmath53 and @xmath54 do increase sharply at small @xmath11 , because of the rapidly decreasing wavelength .",
    "[ f : w ]    = 8.5 cm    [ f : e ]    = 8.5 cm    when dissipation is taken into account , these solutions are modified by viscous attenuation .",
    "our interest is in whether a deformation of the outer part of the disc can propagate into the inner region with non - negligible amplitude . noting that @xmath55 is almost independent of @xmath11 in the above model",
    ", we define the constant parameter @xmath56 by @xmath57 .",
    "then the logarithm of the attenuation factor for a complete crossing of the disc scales approximately with @xmath58 or @xmath59 .    the numerical solutions in fig .",
    "[ f : w ] confirm this behaviour . in the absence of dissipation ,",
    "the bending wave reflects perfectly from the stress - free inner boundary and sets up a standing wave .",
    "significant attenuation is found when @xmath29 exceeds @xmath56 , in which case only a wave with inward group velocity is seen .",
    "if @xmath29 is increased much further , the oscillations are no longer apparent . only in this case",
    "does the inner part of the disc lie in the equatorial plane of the black hole as suggested by @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath23 tends to a constant at large @xmath60 , which corresponds to the inclination of the outer part of the disc with respect to the black hole s equator .",
    "the oscillatory structure of the warp has been noted before @xcite .",
    "traces of it may already have been detected in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the eccentricity is similar ( fig .",
    "[ f : e ] ) except for the shorter wavelength ( still everywhere much longer than @xmath7 ) . again , unless @xmath33 is several times greater than @xmath56 , the eccentricity can reach the inner region .",
    "several caveats accompany these solutions .",
    "radiation pressure , which is more important at higher accretion rates , thickens the inner part of the disc , increases the wavelength , and reduces the attenuation .",
    "viscous overstability may cause the eccentricity to grow , rather than decay , as it propagates inwards .",
    "nonlinearity may be very important .",
    "the relevant damping coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath33 are not generally equal to @xmath61 and remain relatively poorly understood .",
    "in addition , the time for the warp or eccentricity to propagate into the inner region and to establish the steady solutions shown here can be long .",
    "accretion discs around black holes in x - ray binary stars may commonly be warped or eccentric .",
    "depending on the thickness of the disc and the efficiency of dissipative processes , these global deformations may be able to propagate into the innermost part of the disc in the form of stationary bending or density waves .",
    "this is most likely to occur when the disc is hotter and thicker , when the wavelengths are longer and the viscous attenuation is less severe . under these conditions the inner region",
    "may be activated and trapped oscillations may be excited through nonlinear mode couplings @xcite ."
