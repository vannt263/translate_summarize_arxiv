    "the study of distant galaxies is empirically demanding  not surprisingly , as these galaxies are very faint .",
    "of course there are a variety of motivations to observe and perhaps understand distant `` units of the universe '' .",
    "we would like to detail the present - day `` lumpiness '' of the cosmos and its evolution from a very smooth `` sea '' at decoupling . at the nominal redshift of the cosmic microwave background",
    "the key fluctuations on reasonable scales are only of order @xmath2 .",
    "of course at @xmath3 we have a very inhomogenous distribution of baryons we call galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( igm hereafter ) .    noting the obvious , studying distant galaxies is synonymous with traveling far back in cosmic time towards the birth of massive sub - structures and large galaxies .",
    "can we now see directly the development of single galaxies of milky way dimensions ?",
    "we now believe that most galaxies form and accumulate either ( 1 ) by the infall of gas ( and dark matter ) as `` monolithic '' entities , self - gravitating by the time we can observe them , or ( 2 ) by a series of major and/or minor mergers .",
    "this is the now - popular `` bottom - up '' scenario .",
    "here it is presumably difficult to catch the small and immature systems in the act of merging , depending perhaps on the appropriate dynamical time scales .",
    "thus for scenario ( 2 ) we would anticipate young galaxies to illustrate complex morphologies , quite different from those of the mature galactic systems we study readily here and now , at zero redshift .",
    "there is indeed some evidence for `` recent '' mergers from the fine images of distant galaxies observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) - see stern & spinrad ( 1999 ) for some plausible early merger examples ( fig .",
    "we d like to push these examples back in cosmic time to even `` younger '' galaxy growth - but the first problem is , quite naturally , the location of small and dismally faint candidates for galaxies in formation    another important contemporary research area emerging is the study of intergalactic ( gaseous ) matter usually seen in silhouette against a bright background source like a qso or an unusually bright and distant galaxy . and",
    "now , new observational techniques are beginning to tell us about the interaction history of galaxies and the igm ( _ cf .",
    "_ adelberger , 2003 ) .",
    "one of this paper s topics , directly or indirectly stated , is just how early in cosmic epoch ( parameterized by redshift ) we can study individual galaxies or their `` pre - galactic '' fragments .",
    "there is only a short time interval between the early epochs beyond @xmath4 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "how can the galaxies evolve so quickly ?",
    "the historical view of our empirical and theoretical march outward toward higher redshift has shown a fairly rapid expansion . by 1976",
    "a few radio galaxies had been located and studied at @xmath5 . the @xmath6 threshold ( for galaxies ) was crossed in 1981 .",
    "of course quasars and qsos had been actively observed and known earlier at large distances - redshifts in the 1960s and 1970s taking us to @xmath7 ( schmidt 1965 ) and then 2.88 , and then to @xmath8 ( oq 172 ; baldwin , 1974 ) .",
    "finally , @xmath9 for qsos was surpassed by the palomar two - color - based searches ( schneider , schmidt & gunn 1991 ) , and searches for  on low - resolution grism spectra ( osmer 1999 ) were equally successful . almost all the recent stages of the `` qso - z race '' have emphasized red - ir photometry and unusual colors , since the @xmath10 qsos are heavily depressed by the  forest of the igm ( see fan et al .",
    "the largest published qso redshift to date is @xmath11 ( fan , 2002 ; pentericci , 2002a ) .",
    "now we are witness to the era of a friendly race toward higher and record - breaking galaxy redshifts .",
    "the current limit for galaxies , which we shall detail later in this publication , is near @xmath12 .",
    "is this redshift close to the end of the `` dark ages '' , where re - ionization by massive stars and/or early qsos play as vital sources of ionizing radiation ?",
    "we return to this topic , with empirical evidence , toward the conclusion of this review .",
    "over the last three or four years , the thoughts of theorists have narrowed on the birth and evolution of galaxies - including dark matter halos , plus the baryons we observe more directly .",
    "these adventuresome researchers have bi - modally attacked the problems with a pair of model types .",
    "most contemporary modeling assumes , _ ab initio _ , the lambda cold dark matter cosmology ( lcdm ) .    following weinberg , ( 1999 ) , we note that the current ( broad ) theory of galaxy formation and early evolution follows white & rees ( 1978 ) and their `` successors '' - gravitational collapse of a dark matter halo , gas falling into the potential well so defined , and then gas astrophysics ( cooling , contracting , and eventually forming stars in a dense baryonic core ) .",
    "now we often add inflationary cosmological parameters and thus demand @xmath13 .",
    "the `` technology '' for modeling often takes one of two paths .",
    "the first is hierarchical numerical simulations ( with a realistic treatment of the collapse ) including additional gas - phase physics and plenty of computational effort to cover the wide size range of non - spherical assemblies ( the `` roots '' of the assembly `` tree '' ) that appear .",
    "the second tool , deemed the semi - analytical approach , assumes again lcdm halos .",
    "the proto - galaxies contract within , and then we find small sub - galactic systems ( or fragments ? ) with the specific physically - motivated `` stories '' given by the strengths of their star - burst mergers .",
    "the mergers obviously increase the model masses , and also modify the relative numbers of luminous stars and the amount of residual gas . even before that step , the semi - analytic models utilize the press - schecter ( press & schechter 1974 ) formalism to describe the number of halos as a function of their mass .",
    "this approach allows conventional and mature use of population synthesis and even chemical evolution schemes in conjunction with the mergers demanded to build up galaxies of reasonable mass with moderate star - formation rates .",
    "one of the strengths of the direct numerical simulations is to utilize the non - spherical distribution of dark matter and baryons to produce a more realistic treatment of the model s gravitation .",
    "then the more `` astrophysical '' computations can proceed ; weinberg , ( 1999 ) predict the surface densities of galaxies as a function of their star - formation rate ( sfr ) over a relevant range of redshifts .    the semi - analytic models ( _ cf . _",
    "baugh 1999 ; somerville & primak 1999 ) have now been amplified to include a range of interesting physical processes , hopefully relevant to early galaxy evolution .",
    "for example , the central baryons and the outer dark matter ( dm ) halo interact to change the halo structure and foster further contraction of the model galaxy .",
    "baugh ( 1998 ) mention that the main constraining property of local galaxies they favor for comparison with semi - analytic modeling is the field galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the agreement is good ; one can then easily visualize the effect of omitting or including various individual physical processes , like star - formation ( sf ) feedback .",
    "the sfr in the early universe ( say , to @xmath4 or 4 ) of these models is also well - matched by observations of the sfr per unit volume .",
    "( madau et al . 1999 ) .",
    "weinberg et al . ( 1999 ) also show the numerical simulation s cumulative distribution of galaxies ( with the parameter @xmath14 surface density/@xmath15/unit @xmath16 ) as a function of their sf rate from @xmath17 to @xmath18 . at the moderately large galaxian @xmath19 for @xmath20 ,",
    "the predicted surface density of galaxies is nearly @xmath21 .",
    "this surface density is rather higher ( by a factor of @xmath22 ) than observed by spinrad and collaborators ( although some of this observational statistic is derived from the  - sfr correlation , which may be suspect ) .",
    "the best unpublished observational estimate for the sfr surface density at @xmath10 is now @xmath23 .",
    "however , this surface density for  emitters is uncertain because their continua are often very weak and thus not necessarily sampled consistently in terms of galaxy luminosity .",
    "the theoretical simulations and follow - up astrophysical scaling may , of course , be systematically over - efficient in , for example , converting cooling gas to massive star births .",
    "the numerical simulations with lcdm may have one flaw : they over - predict the number of small galaxies near larger ones ( which are countable ) and thus the number of stars at low redshifts .",
    "we are not positive that a real problem exists ; it may be that dark halos with coupled non - stellar baryons ( , high velocity clouds ( klypin , 1999 ) are being `` counted '' as observable systems .",
    "the potential problems of early galaxy evolution from the theoretical side may well change , increasing or decreasing as their confrontations with empirical `` facts '' or new understandings go forward .",
    "the general outlines of the theory and relevant observations are probably fairly firm .",
    "it is a very human tendency to climb a celestial mountain .",
    "so it stands for any race , including that of finding individual objects at greater and greater distances , abbreviated usually as at larger redshift , or `` bigger z '' ( where @xmath24 ) .",
    "as stern & spinrad ( 1999 ) pointed out in their table 1 , there has been a fairly rapid increase in `` zmax '' for galaxies ; we went from @xmath25 in 1956 to @xmath261 by 1982 , but then to @xmath27 in 1998 and @xmath28 in 1999 .",
    "the record - breaking progress since 1998 has been due to observations of the strong  ( from rest @xmath29  ) emission line , shifted to the visible and red by the universal expansion . over the past year",
    "the `` lala '' ( large area lyman alpha survey ) team ( rhoads 2003 ) have selected  emitters to @xmath30 .",
    "they are currently taking images for the @xmath31 airglow window . also in 2002 hu et al .",
    "have located a cluster - lensed galaxy at the outstanding redshift of @xmath32 ! and as these pages are completed , a subaru group has found a faint  galaxy at @xmath33 .",
    "modern research on quasars ( qsos , to be more precise ) , has also progressed ; osmer ( 1999 ) reviewed the situation 3 years ago , with qsos located up to @xmath34 .",
    "since then , the sloan digital sky survey has been successfully pushed qso redshifts to and beyond @xmath35 ! the key here is to obtain good red and near ir photometry , in particular looking for objects with very red ( i - z ) colors .",
    "the sloan results are very current ; fan  ( 2002 ) found sdss j103027.1 at @xmath11 , and a preprint on another sloan qso at @xmath36 is just available as this section is being written .",
    "so the most distant qso to date still trails the most distant , much fainter normal galaxy by a modest margin",
    "!    the distant qsos are likely buried in a host galaxy which itself is well - hidden in the glare of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "we now assume the presence of the underlying galaxy of stars and gas , in part confirmed indirectly by the normal abundances of the elements inferred from the emission lines in the qso spectra .",
    "how do we go about locating the faint and distant galaxies at the heart of our exploration and this review ?",
    "we found several successful ( or partly successful ) methods to locate the faint targets at high redshift : none are without `` flaws '' .",
    "for example , some methods are weakened by `` contaminants '' , be they intrinsically faint m , l , or t dwarf stars in the galactic disk , or a mis - identified ( longer wavelength , smaller redshift ) emission line .    following the theme in the stern & spinrad ( 1999 ) review",
    ", we shall discuss several of the more successful search techniques ; initially we ll review the finding of distant galaxies utilizing non - optical wavelengths .",
    "often these techniques turn out to be `` safe '' and productive .",
    "radio galaxies at high redshift are rare but interesting guides to the location of large , mature galaxies and correlated structures - sometimes actual ( rich ) clusters ( van breugel  1999 ; lilly & longair 1984 ) .",
    "for some specific cases , like 4c 41.17 ( @xmath37 ) , and also radio sources resembling it , we note that steep radio spectral indices and moderate flux densities correlate with high redshift and great luminosity .",
    "such objects are visible across much of the presently observable universe .    the stronger radio galaxies , those with fluxes @xmath38 mjy , tend to follow a good hubble relationship in the observer s near - ir bands ; that is , their ( k , z ) magnitude  redshift correlation is linear with only a moderate scatter .",
    "this result shows that the powerful radio galaxies , e systems in morphological appearance , have a fairly strong resemblance to a luminous `` standard candle '' ( van breugel  1999 ; best 1999 ) .",
    "the history of the steep radio spectral index `` angle '' is reviewed by de breuck  ( 2000 ) .",
    "going for the steeep radio spectral counterparts also tends to minimize the `` contamination '' by quasars ( radio spectral indices @xmath39 ) .",
    "we then may inquire : are all steep radio sources luminous galaxies and quasar candidates ?",
    "the answer here is mainly negative ; it is the medium strength ( so as not to exceed some limiting intrinsic luminosity ) steep spectrum sources , identified at long wavelengths in the optical and ir that have the greatest promise in pointing out very distant spectrographic targets .",
    "these may be radio - loud stellar systems at a large redshift , say @xmath40 .",
    "somewhat tangential to our central motivation , we note that at both small and large distances , radio galaxies possess some / many of the characteristics of giant e galaxies ( or luminous cluster es ) .",
    "since these e galaxies here and now have a strong correlation amplitude at small separations , we can anticipate many of the distant radio es to also have smaller companions - perhaps in a group population .",
    "these earmarks of early structure are going to be valuable ; the recent paper of venemans  ( 2002 ) illustrates a large ( 2mpc ) overdense region at a redshift @xmath41 located `` around '' the radio galaxy tnj1338 - 1942 . so the radio galaxy becomes a valuable marker in such a case .",
    "we note another , less well - documented case in the hdf(n ) is currently being explored by stern , dey , dawson , and spinrad . here",
    "the redshift is even greater ; the first observed galaxies have @xmath42 .",
    "no radio source takes part in that overdensity region , however .",
    "stern et al . ( 2003 ) show a group surrounding the radio galaxy mg0442 + 0202 at @xmath43 .",
    "the record redshift for a radio galaxy is still @xmath44 ( van breugel  1999 ) , with tnj0924 - 2201 .",
    "several observing groups are concentrating on the identification of deep samples showing a steep spectrum , with the expectation that some are ultra - luminous and located at @xmath45 .",
    "these are rare systems ; one problem in interpretation is that it should be a fairly slow process to `` build '' a large and luminous galaxy . perhaps it requires a cosmic interval in excess of a billion years to do so , either in the model described as a `` monolithic collapse '' ( eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ) , or by the accumulation of smaller structures ( searle & zinn 1978 ) - a hierarchical model . with the currently popular cosmology [ @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , the look - back interval between @xmath9 and ( an arbitrary ) @xmath49 is only @xmath50 gyr ( see fig .",
    "2 again ) . that might be sufficient time to build a large galaxy ; the implication is then a sfr of @xmath51 .",
    "that is a rarely observed and atypically high sfr .",
    "so it is a clue that massive radio galaxies are unlikely to be found at @xmath52 .",
    "but the near - ir hubble diagram of the highest - z radio galaxies plotted by van breugel  ( 1999 ) continues to suggest a continuity in galaxy luminosity which we may still extrapolate to stellar ( and gaseous ) mass similarities .    under standard cdm - based models of galaxy evolution",
    ", we expect the giant elliptical galaxies , which are the hosts of today s radio galaxies , to form late ( at @xmath53 ) through a process of merging of smaller sub - units . although these models seem to be consistent with what is known so far about field galaxy evolution ( e.g.  barger et al .",
    "1999 ) , and indeed with observations of the hosts of the radio - quiet quasar population ( ridgway 2000 ) , it is clear that radio galaxies are an exception .",
    "they seem to only show significant evolution at @xmath54 , and still appear to be luminous galaxies at @xmath55 and perhaps beyond .",
    "one possible solution is that the most massive galaxies formed first in so - called anti  hierarchical baryonic collapse . in this model ( granato et al .",
    "2001 ) the high baryon densities in the centers of the most massive dark matter halos cause them to start forming stars early .",
    "the fate of simplistic theoretical analyses suggest the need for a sharper observational analysis .      to date many new x - ray galaxies",
    "have been located , using modern x - ray satellites such as chandra and xmm - newton . however , there are few x - ray - selected very distant galaxies , or agn . to my knowledge",
    "there is one at a redshift in excess of 5 ; it is # 174 in barger  ( 2002 ) at @xmath56 , in the chandra deep - field , north .",
    "we will return to this galaxy a bit later .",
    "there are , however , a considerable number of qsos and other clearly noticed agn at @xmath57 ( cf .",
    "brandt 2002 ) .",
    "why are we physically interested in x - ray galaxies , anyway ? as barger  ( 2001 ) affirm , x - ray surveys , especially at hard ( 2 - 7kev ) energies , provide a direct indication of an agn , presumably due to an ultra - massive black hole at the galaxy nucleus . at @xmath58 kev , absorption will play less of an obscuring role than seen for some `` hidden '' agns at optical frequencies and soft x - ray energies .",
    "complete samples of hard x - ray energies are now possible with the chandra x - ray observatory ; the @xmath59 x - ray positions produce robust optical identifications of the counterparts . and",
    "about half of the sources can be identified with optically bright and `` quiet '' galaxies ; they are at small redshifts .    with the longest integrations ( say , one mega - second integrations ) we begin to locate the faint x - ray population .",
    "some of these sources are quite distant , @xmath57 ( cf .",
    "barger  2002 ) .",
    "their survey of the chandra deep - field , north ( equivalent to the hdf(n ) ) yielded a fair number of more - distant x - ray identifications ; table 1 , below , puts them in @xmath60 bins , and includes both narrow and broad - line ( agn ) x - ray sources .",
    ".large redshifts in the chandra x - ray sources ( cdfn ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notes on the initial discovery techniques ",
    "nb = narrow - band selected ; lbg = continuum lyman - break / lyman - forest break selected ; ser = serendipitously identified ; other = selected in other manner ( e.g. , radio - selected , x - ray selected ) ; lens = known gravitational lens .",
    "[ tab1 ]    we note that since 1999 astronomers have added at least 25 galaxies with @xmath61 .",
    "this is an impressive and useful score ; however , a more physical analysis of several aspects of the pioneering effort is now an obvious and desired second approach .",
    "also , the morphologies of the continuum and  lines may provide useful information on the environs of very early galactic systems .",
    "the cut - off date for entries in table 8.3 was 2003 february .",
    "wide - field narrow - band and broad - band imaging with large ground - based telescopes have considerable promise .",
    "narrow - band and broad - spectral - band studies of the sky areas already earmarked for multi - wave observation is one useful approach .",
    "it is already been successful in the hubble deep fields .",
    "such imaging photometry has already turned up distant galaxies , especially at @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( airglow windows for narrow - band studies ) .",
    "we know of several groups planning to search for  emitters at the highest redshifts available to ccd detectors ( @xmath64  ; @xmath65 )",
    ". a more ambitious plan would be to utilize ir detectors at the best ( oh - band - free ) sky windows in j band ( @xmath66  ; @xmath67 ) .",
    "exploration of the interval @xmath68 should bring us to the edge of the re - ionization epoch where the first stars and quasars began to ionize ( again ) the halos around collections of dark matter and baryons . a schematic cartoon ( pentericci  2002b ) is shown by loeb & barkana ( 2001 ) .",
    "is it realistic ?",
    "we ll hope that very distant galaxy images and spectra will tell us about very early star formation at the end of the long `` dark age '' . at this time it is uncertain as to whether the first luminous and ionizing objects were star - forming galaxies ! but something or some process began star - formation through the darkness and led to the formation of young stars and young galaxies .",
    "we may soon barely detect these faint `` first galaxies '' with our telescopes and intellects .",
