    "the electromagnetic ( em ) decay of baryons can provide considerable information on their underlying structure .",
    "this transition offers a clean probe of the wavefunction of the initial and final state baryons , providing theoretical constraints and tests of the quark model .",
    "the non - relativistic quark model ( nrqm ) of isgur and karl @xcite predicts the electromagnetic properties of the ground state baryons reasonably well .",
    "it has been less successful giving accurate descriptions of the low - lying excited - state hyperons .",
    "several other theoretical techniques have been used to more accurately calculate these transitions , including ( nrqm ) @xcite , a relativized constituent quark model ( rcqm ) @xcite , a chiral constituent quark model ( @xmath6cqm ) @xcite , the mit bag model @xcite , the bound - state soliton model @xcite , a three - flavor generalization of the skyrme model that uses the collective approach @xcite , and an algebraic model of hadron structure @xcite .",
    "photoproduction from nucleon targets is a useful technique to cleanly generate a significant statistical sample of hyperons and to measure em transitions to other decuplet baryons .",
    "if the em transition form factors for decuplet baryons with strangeness are also sensitive to meson cloud effects , models attempting to make predictions of the decuplet radiative decay widths will need revisions to incorporate this effect .",
    "comparison of data for the em decay of decuplet hyperons , @xmath2 , to the present predictions of quark models provides a measure of the importance of meson cloud diagrams in the @xmath7 transition .",
    "experimental results for the em decay ratios for all @xmath2 charge states are desirable to obtain a complete comparison to em decay predictions for the @xmath2",
    ". precision measurements of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 decay widths can be particularly useful in determining the degree of su(3 ) symmetry breaking .",
    "the decay width from the measurement of @xmath10 @xcite is much larger than most current theoretical predictions .",
    "this could be due to meson cloud effects , which were not included in these calculations .",
    "there is a theoretical basis for calculating these effects @xcite that suggests pion cloud effects may be sizable .",
    "for example , they are predicted to contribute on the order of @xmath1140% to the @xmath12 magnetic dipole transition form factor , @xmath13 , for low @xmath14 .",
    "the cqm @xcite indicates that the value of @xmath15 is directly proportional to the proton magnetic moment @xcite , and measurements of @xmath16 for low @xmath14 are rationalized in the framework of the model if the experimental magnetic moment is lowered by about 25% .    with theoretical predictions for the degree at which the meson cloud effects plays a role ,",
    "it is then possible to test @xmath17 flavor symmetry breaking ( and the degree at which it is broken ) .",
    "this can be achieved by measuring both the @xmath18 and @xmath19 decay widths and comparing these to predictions from flavor su(3 ) relations .",
    "just like isospin invariance can be used to compare the @xmath20 and @xmath21 decays , u - spin invariance may be used to compare the @xmath22 and @xmath23 decays .",
    "u - spin is analogous to isospin in that it is a symmetry in the exchange of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 quarks rather than the @xmath26 and @xmath24 quarks .",
    "a value of u - spin can be assigned to each baryon based on its quark composition .",
    "the @xmath27 and the @xmath28 of the baryon decuplet have @xmath29 , whereas the octet baryons @xmath30 and @xmath31 have @xmath32 .",
    "u - spin symmetry forbids radiative decays of specific decuplet baryons .",
    "since the photon is a charge singlet with @xmath33 , this implies that @xmath34 have zero amplitude in the equal - mass limit due to u - spin symmetry .",
    "this can also be understood in the context of the su(6 ) wavefunctions for these baryons .",
    "the m1 transition operator is written between the initial and final states as : @xmath35 here the sum is over all @xmath36 constituent quarks , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the mass , spin vector and charge of the @xmath36 quark , @xmath40 is the propagation direction , and @xmath41 is the polarization vector .",
    "one can also show that the same transition operator for the @xmath42 gives a non - zero amplitude .",
    "u - spin invariance implies a large difference in the radiative decay widths of the @xmath27 and @xmath42 .",
    "the chiral symmetry for u - spin is strongly broken because the _ constituent _ mass of the strange quark , @xmath43 , is approximately 1.5 times greater than the non - strange quarks , @xmath44 .",
    "the magnetic moment is inversely proportional to the mass , and so there is no cancellation in the wavefunction like in the equal - mass @xmath45 case in eq .",

    "@xcite , an estimate of the ratio of the em decay rates from the ratio of the square of the transition operators can be expressed as @xmath46 resulting in a value of about 1% .",
    "this suggests that u - spin symmetry breaking for radiative decays is at the level of only a few percent . at this level",
    "u - spin is an effective tool , even considering the quark mass difference .",
    "detailed calculations from the cqm and @xmath47-type expansions of the em decay rates have been carried out by several groups @xcite , all of which come up with decay ratios of a similar scale . in lattice qcd ,",

    "the 90% confidence level upper bound of @xmath48 kev was reported , however most models predict a value of less than 4 kev .",
    "ultimately this result has limited power to constrain theoretical estimates .",
    "more experimental measurements are necessary to provide better constraints .",
    "a program to investigate the various @xmath49 electromagnetic decays is underway using data from the cebaf large angle spectrometer ( clas ) detector .",
    "first , two independent analyses of the em decay of the @xmath50 have been completed @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the consistency in these results has given confidence in the notion that meson cloud effects are indeed contributing significantly .",
    "the next step described and presented here was to measure the @xmath42 electromagnetic decay , which has not been done before .",
    "the final program analysis for the @xmath8 decay will be addressed in a future clas publication .    in the following , a description of the experimental details and analysis procedure for extracting the @xmath42 em decay branching ratio normalized to the strong decay is provided .",
    "some specifics are given about neutron detection and the development of the neutron covariance matrix required by the analysis .",
    "after the signal extraction a u - spin symmetry test using the u - spin su(3 ) multiplet representation is used to predict the @xmath51 and @xmath52 partial widths , which are then compared to the experimental results .",

    "this includes tracks at extremely forward or backward angles , areas near the torus coils , and regions where the drift chambers and scintillator counter efficiencies were not well understood .",
    "tracks that point near these shadow regions are less likely to be reconstructed accurately .",
    "in addition a minimum momentum of 0.125 gev , after energy loss corrections , was enforced for both positively and negatively charged particles to ensure accurate drift chamber track reconstruction .    during the initial data skim ,",
    "the hit times in the start counter that surround the target were used to find an interaction vertex time for each charged particle , which was then matched up with photons identified in the tagger , where there can be up to 10 candidate photons for a given event .",
    "the photon with the closest time to any track was selected as the photon that caused the event .",
    "specifically , the time of interaction was determined using the time of the electron beam bucket ( the accelerator rf time ) that produced the event . to correlate the interaction time with the photon production time ,",
    "a timing coincidence between the tagger and the start counter was used .",

    "the directional components of the neutral track were found by using the vertex and the cluster position on the ec for that hit . in this experiment",
    "the information about the neutral vertex was limited to the information that could be extracted from the other charged particle vertices in the decay chain .",
    "the ec has six triangular sectors made of alternating layers of lead and scintillator .",
    "scintillator layers compose of about 10-cm - wide scintillator strips , where strips in every consecutive layer run parallel to one of the three sides of the triangle .",
    "the ec has 13 layers of scintillator strips for each of the three directions making 39 total layers . in each direction the ec",

    "for example , if there are multiple hits which have the same u peak , the energy in v and w is added for each of the hits , and the ratio of these summed energies determines the weight of the u peak s energy of the multiple hits . if the software thresholds for the scintillator strip , peak and weighted hit energy are met then the cluster position and time are recorded .",
    "the events ec time ( or ec time - of - flight ) is defined as the time between the event start time and the time of the ec cluster .    during analysis",
    "the strip information was used to determine whether the centroid was reconstructed using only the outer stack of the ec or both the inner stack and outer stack .",
    "the centroid could be located in any one of the layers of each stack , however , the cluster reconstruction position did not contain that information , so the hit was assumed to be on the upstream face ( closer to the target ) of whichever stack the hit was contained in . with the assumed reaction vertex and the ec cluster position , the directional components in @xmath96 and @xmath97 were found , as well as the path length of the neutron . using the ec time - of - flight",

    "having clean constraints on the @xmath88 and @xmath99 is important when considering the event topology @xmath100 .",
    "a thorough study of the accuracy of the ec for neutron reconstruction in all kinematic ranges has not been achieved previously at clas . obtaining",
    "the resolution in all measured variables for neutron reconstruction was an essential part of the present analysis .",
    "correlations between each measured variable in the ec had also not been previously studied .",
    "the ec covariance matrix of the neutron can give a lot of information about the quality of the kinematic variables in each region of the ec .",
    "these values can then be used to weight the neutron measurements appropriately in kinematic constraints that depend on maximum likelihood methods @xcite .",
    "there are resolution differentials in all measured variables that are related to the acceptance of the ec .",
    "hits from the center of each triangular sector have better measurements over those on the edges due to shower leakage .",
    "the inner and outer stacks can act as separate detectors in the sense that if a hit is seen in the outer but not the inner stack , then the inner stack plays no role in the reconstruction of that hit .",
    "it is far less common for an event to pass through the inner stack with no effect and to register a hit in the outer stack , but for these events , the outer ec stack was used independently with its own unique resolution parameters for each measured variable .",
    "all possible combinations of the measured neutron dependence on @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath79 were studied to develop a complete understanding of the neutron variance and covariance in the ec @xcite .",
    "the test reaction @xmath101 was isolated in the @xmath54 data set by selecting a @xmath89 and two @xmath87 , and kinematically fitting to a missing neutron hypothesis and then taking a @xmath102 confidence level cut .",
    "only the detected neutrons found in a direction less than @xmath103 from the kinematically fit three pion missing momentum were used to ensure the correct neutron .",
    "this channel was selected because the final decay products are identical to the reaction of interest @xmath100 .",
    "in addition , the momentum range of the detected particles is the same .",
    "kinematic constraints were imposed to remove possible @xmath87 @xmath89 combinations with invariant mass equal to the @xmath88 , so that only the @xmath101 events survived .",
    "the simplification made by working with the test channel is that in the @xmath101 reaction , there is only one interaction vertex .",
    "this implies that the neutron comes from the primary interaction vertex , which can be well determined using the charged pions .    to study the measured neutron variable residuals , we required each event to have one detected neutron and then compared the measured variable with the kinematically fit missing variable in each case . assuming a high quality missing neutron four vector , this procedure was used to find the change in resolution with respect to all measured variables over the ec face @xcite . only the events that registered an actual hit in the ec",
    "were used to study the resolution .",
    "no ec fiducial cuts were applied during the covariance investigation so that the entire ec face could be studied and compared to monte carlo . during analysis ,",
    "only the minimal fiducial cuts were applied of @xmath104 on the neutron polar angle to maximize the statistics .    for the test channel",
    "the neutron vertex was found from a multi - track - vertex fitting procedure to give an accurate vertex ( at less than 4% uncertainty in position for the topology of interest ) for multiple final state particles all coming from the same vertex @xcite .",
    "because the neutron came from the primary interaction vertex in this study , its vertex was accurately known .",
    "however , for events in which the neutron comes from secondary vertices , its vertex is not as easily obtained .",
    "because the neutron vertex information can affect its reconstructed four momentum , these differences can be important when studying resolutions .",
    "once the ec neutron covariance matrix for @xmath101 was well understood , the monte carlo resolution was matched to the data using the same test channel @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo was then used to study the @xmath105 channel and to find the neutron covariance matrix specific for this topology . in this way the @xmath88 interaction point with the beam line could be used as the starting point of the neutron path in the neutron reconstruction process for any of the decays , so no bias was introduced by assuming a @xmath106 .",
    "this step removed the explicit dependence on the neutron vertex .",
    "the monte carlo covariance matrix for @xmath105 was then used to tune the data neutron covariance matrix specific to the topology .",
    "the change in the momentum resolution from this tuning process was smaller than @xmath107 .    in order to obtain a consistent covariance matrix for the neutron , discrimination was made for each neutron between the inner and outer ec stacks in order to calculate the correct path length .",
    "in addition , timing and momentum corrections were applied as described below .",
    "as previously stated , the distance that the neutron travels in clas was used with the ec time - of - flight to determine the momentum of the neutron .",
    "the distance is dependent on the ec stack and the position of the cluster reconstruction .",
    "the inner stack cluster reconstruction was always used unless there was only a hit in the outer stack .",
    "a determination of whether there was a hit only in the outer stack , the inner stack , or both , was made by checking which ec scintillators were associated with an event . the probability to find a hit in the outer stack alone was less than 15% . for all other neutral hits either the inner stack or both",
    "were associated with the hit .",
    "if there was a hit only in the outer ec stack , the first layer ( layer closest to the target ) of the outer stack gave the plane of the ec cluster coordinates .",
    "if there was a hit in the inner stack or both , the first layer of the inner stack was used as the plane of the ec cluster coordinates .",
    "the time - of - flight for the neutron came from the difference between the event start time and the ec cluster time . the path length used to reconstruct the neutron momentum , which assumes a hit on the ec face of either the inner or outer stack , was inaccurate by the distance the neutron traveled past the ec face into the detector .",
    "a correction was used to compensate for the average additional distance the neutron travels into the ec .",
    "in addition the outer stack is farther from the target and for the same event would have a slightly different time response than that of the inner stack .",
    "a correction was implemented directly in the neutron time - of - flight to correct the neutron momentum .",

    "however , in order to obtain accurate covariance information an additional momentum correction was required which is sensitive to the geometry of the ec and neutrons trajectory .",
    "it was only after all corrections that the residual means of all measured variables were centered around zero to accurately reflect the neutron resolutions .",
    "a neutron momentum correction was implemented by studying the trend found in momentum and position resolutions over various kinematic ranges .",

    "there were three unknowns from the components of the missing momentum vector and four constraints from the conservation of energy and momentum to make a 1-c fit @xcite .",
    "the trend of each of the residuals should be distributed around zero , if it is not , the distribution will display a trend that can be used to correct the measured variable .",
    "once the neutron momentum magnitude and directional resolutions are evenly distributed around zero , the missing and detected four - vectors are comparable .",
    "this implies that for the majority of events , the detected neutron momentum vector was the same within the experimental resolution as the high quality kinematically fit missing neutron momentum vector .",

    "an estimate of this leakage was found and then subtracted out of the final result , as discussed in the following sections .",
    "to tune the @xmath42 monte carlo , the differential cross sections for the reactions @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 were obtained .",
    "the shapes of the differential cross sections were then used to adjust the event generators . in each case a @xmath196 photon energy distribution was used in the generator .    a normalization procedure shown to accurately reproduce a number of well - measured channels",
    "was used for each cross section @xcite .",
    "the following is a discussion of the procedure used to extract the @xmath197 cross section .",
    "a similar procedure was followed for the two background channels .    with all of the aforementioned constraints",
    "the @xmath198 reaction was easily isolated with a kinematic fit to the missing @xmath129 .",
    "a @xmath102 confidence level cut was applied to ensure channel purity .",
    "the yield was determined by the ratio of the raw @xmath199 events to the number of incident photons in each @xmath200 bin , so as to normalize with the bremsstrahlung spectrum .",
    "corrections were made for each bin with the newly obtained acceptances .",
    "the angular dependence in the generator was initially flat with a zero @xmath137-slope dependence .",
    "after the differential cross section was obtained , the distributions were used to adjust the @xmath42 generator . each corresponding angle and energy bin",
    "was filled according to the distributions seen in the data results .",
    "each angle bin was divided into @xmath200 bins and represented accordingly in the new event weighting scheme of the generator .",
    "the adjusted generator was then used to produce new monte carlo and obtain more accurate acceptances .",
    "this process was then iterated until no change was seen to the differential cross sections within the statistical uncertainties .",
    "after these modifications were made , the resulting monte carlo was compared with the data , using the momentum distributions for the @xmath89 , @xmath87 , and neutron tracks , as well as the @xmath88 lab frame angle distribution , and found to closely match the data within the statistical uncertainties , see fig .",
    "[ momcom ] .",
    "the same corrections were applied to the @xmath201 cross sections .",
    "the nature of the corrections to the monte carlo were specific to the @xmath197 cross section and so the corrections could be applied without discrimination between the electromagnetic and strong decays of the baryon .    to calculate the acceptance of the signal and background reactions , an extraction method used to resolve the radiative and @xmath129 channels was required and will be discussed next .      the two - step kinematic fitting procedure developed in ref .",
    "@xcite was employed to resolve the radiative and strong decay signals .",
    "because of such similar topologies and the small relative size of the radiative signal , the kinematic fitting procedure could not be expected to cleanly separate the @xmath202 events from the overwhelming @xmath203 events in a single fit .",
    "thus we employed a two - step kinematic fitting procedure , making first a kinematic fit to a missing @xmath64 hypothesis , then checking the quality of the fit of the low confidence level candidates in a second kinematic fit to the actual radiative hypothesis .    in order to check the quality of the kinematic fit to a particular hypothesis",
    ", we studied the @xmath204 distribution from the fitting results . in this procedure all detected particles were kinematically fit to the appropriate missing mass hypothesis .",
    "an additional constraint was introduced into the kinematic fitting enabling analysis of the more well - behaved 2-c @xmath205 distribution , as opposed to the 1-c distribution , to test the quality of the candidates with the hypothesis used .",
    "the constraint required that the neutron and @xmath206 track have an invariant mass of the @xmath99 in the hypothesis .",
    "the detected particle tracks were kinematically fit as the final stage of analysis and filtered with the confidence level cut . in this fit",
    "there were three unknowns ( @xmath207 ) and five constraint equations , four from conservation of momentum and then the additional invariant mass condition .",
    "this makes a 2-c kinematic fit . in the attempt to separate the various contributions of the @xmath42 radiative decay and the decay to @xmath208 , the events were fit using different hypotheses for the topology :    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : final ]    the partial width in both cases is larger than any prediction listed except for the u - spin prediction",
    "the u - spin predictions for the @xmath10 and @xmath209 partial widths are well validated by the experimental result . for these cases u - spin symmetry",
    "is confirmed within the experimental uncertainties .",
    "it is important to note that the u - spin prediction for the @xmath42 em decay partial width ignores the effects of the interference of the isovector and isoscalar components of the photon . if the isoscalar component interfered destructively , the resulting prediction could indeed be much smaller .    the results in ref .",
    "@xcite reveal that the meson cloud effect can contribute significantly ( @xmath210 ) to the overall electromagnetic decay width of the @xmath211 .",
    "this puts the prediction from the model at about @xmath212 of the experimental measurement .",
    "as stated previously it has not yet been determined from a theoretical standpoint if the meson cloud effects contribute and if so to what degree for the radiative decay of the @xmath50 and @xmath42 .",
    "this may be the reason for such a difference in the predictions seen from experiment compared to the models listed in table [ tab : final ] .",
    "because the u - spin prediction for the @xmath49 em decay width uses empirical information from the @xmath213 em decay , contributions from phenomena like the meson cloud effect should be inherent .",
    "the correspondence between the u - spin prediction and the experimental result strongly suggests that the other models lack that corresponding effect .",
    "perhaps this work can prompt more encompassing calculations that are necessary to probe the structure of the baryon resonances and motivate consideration of the meson cloud contributions for electromagnetic decay predictions .",
