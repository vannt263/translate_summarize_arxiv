    "at present the top quark has not yet been conclusively discovered at the fermilab tevatron , even though there are events which look similar to those expected from top quark decays .",
    "the experimental situation is presently confusing because both the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite collaborations only have limited statistics .",
    "as more events are collected one expects that the situation will be clarified .    at the tevatron",
    ", the top quark should be mainly produced through @xmath2 pair production from the light mass quarks and gluons in the colliding proton and antiproton .",
    "both the top quark and the top antiquark then decay to @xmath3 pairs , and each @xmath4 boson can decay either hadronically or leptonically .",
    "the @xmath5-quark becomes an on - mass - shell @xmath6-hadron which subsequently decays into leptons and ( charmed ) hadrons .",
    "a large effort is being made to reconstruct the top quark mass from the measured particles in the decay , which is complicated by the fact that the neutrinos are never detected .",
    "also there are additional jets so it is not clear which ones to choose to recombine .",
    "the best channel for this mass reconstruction is where both @xmath4 bosons decay leptonically , one to a @xmath7 pair , the other to a @xmath8 pair ( a dilepton event ) because the backgrounds in this channel are small .",
    "when only a single lepton is detected then it is necessary to identify the @xmath5 quark in the decay to remove large backgrounds from the production of @xmath9 jets @xcite . in all cases",
    "the reconstruction of the particles in the final state involves both the details of the production of the top quark - antiquark pair as well as the knowledge of their fragmentation and decay products .",
    "the cdf collaboration @xcite have reported two events with dilepton final states , six events with a single lepton and a @xmath5-quark identified by a secondary vertex , and seven single lepton events with the @xmath5-quark identified by a semileptonic decay .",
    "the cdf collaboration then constructed a likelihood function for the invariant mass @xcite and quoted the value @xmath10 gev@xmath11 .",
    "the top quark cross section quoted by the cdf collaboration is @xmath12 pb . the d0 collaboration @xcite have reported on nine events with an expected background of @xmath13 . if the excess is due to @xmath14 production and if the top quark mass is 180 gev@xmath15 , then the top quark cross section is @xmath16 pb .    the values for the top quark production cross section as a function of the top quark mass used by the cdf and d0 collaborations contain both the nlo qcd corrections and an extension to include the resummation of initial state soft partons to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "a recent summary of the theoretical predictions has been presented in @xcite . in the laenen",
    "paper @xcite the dis factorization scheme was used with the mrsd@xmath17 parton distributions @xcite , the two - loop running coupling constant with five active flavors , and @xmath18 gev .    in the analysis of the decay distributions one",
    "needs knowledge of the inclusive differential distributions of the heavy quarks in transverse momentum @xmath19 and rapidity @xmath20 .",
    "these distributions are known in nlo .",
    "what we would like to discuss in this paper is an updating of the resummation effects on the inclusive transverse momentum distribution of the top quark . in the original paper @xcite it",
    "was not known which mass to choose whereas now we can assume that the mass is @xmath21 gev@xmath15 .",
    "also we discuss here how the resummation effects modify the rapidity distribution of the top quark .",
    "since there have been suggestions of using the mass and angular distributions in top quark production to look for physics beyond the standard model @xcite it is very important to know the normal qcd predictions for these quantities .",
    "we first summarize what is known on the top quark cross section .",
    "if the top quark mass is 175 gev@xmath15 then the dominant production channel is @xmath22 .",
    "in lowest order qcd perturbation theory it contributes about 90 % of the total cross section with the reaction @xmath23 making up the remaining 10% .",
    "one notes that the nlo corrections in the @xmath24 channel are small , whereas those in the @xmath25 channel are more than 80% . at this large top quark mass",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 channels give negligible contributions so we do not consider them . even though the @xmath25 channel contribution is small in born approximation it can be significant in nlo due to multiple soft parton radiation .",
    "these large corrections are predominantly from the threshold region for heavy quark production .",
    "it was shown previously @xcite that initial state gluon bremsstrahlung ( isgb ) is responsible for the large corrections at nlo near threshold .",
    "in @xcite the dominant logarithms from isgb , which are the cause of the large corrections near threshold , were carefully examined .",
    "such logarithms have been studied previously in drell - yan ( dy ) @xcite production at fixed target energies ( again near threshold ) where they are responsible for correspondingly large corrections .",
    "the analogy between dy and heavy quark production cross sections was exploited in @xcite and a formula to resum the leading and next - to - leading logarithms in pqcd to all orders was proposed . since the contributions due to these logarithms are positive ( when all scales @xmath28 are set equal to the heavy quark mass @xmath29 ) , the effect of summing the higher order corrections increases the top quark production cross section over that predicted in @xmath1 .",
    "this sum , which will be identified as @xmath30 , depends on a nonperturbative parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the reason that a new parameter has to be introduced is that the resummation is sensitive to the scale at which pqcd breaks down .",
    "as we approach the threshold region other , nonperturbative , physics plays a role ( higher twist , bound states , etc . )",
    "indicated by a dramatic increase in @xmath32 and in the resummed cross section .",
    "this is commonly called the effect of the infrared renormalon or landau pole @xcite .",
    "we chose to simply cut off the resummation at a specific scale @xmath31 where @xmath33 since it is not obvious how to incorporate the nonperturbative effects .",
    "note that our resummed corrections diverge for small @xmath31 but this is _ not _ physical since they should be joined smoothly onto some nonperturbative prescription and the total cross section will be finite .",
    "another way to make it finite would be to avoid the infrared renormalon by a specific continuation around it , i.e. the principal value resummation method .",
    "however , at the moment our total resummed corrections depend on the parameter @xmath31 for which we can only make a rough estimate .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "to make this paper self - contained we list some relevant formulae .",
    "the partonic processes under discussion will be denoted by @xmath34 where @xmath35 . the kinematical variables @xmath36 are introduced in the calculation of the corrections to the single particle inclusive differential distributions of the heavy ( anti)quark .",

    "there are no additional partons so @xmath53 . in @xcite",
    "the nlo contributions were examined in the soft region ( where @xmath54 ) and it was found that the dominant contribution to the nlo cross section in this region had a similar form to the nlo correction in the drell - yan process .",
