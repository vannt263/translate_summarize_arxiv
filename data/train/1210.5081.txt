    ", it is not a complete and fundamental theory of nature since it leaves some big questions unanswered .",
    "notably , it does not provide satisfactory explanations for the values of its many parameters , it does not detail a mechanism that reconciles gravity with quantum mechanics , and it does not explain the origin of dark energy and dark matter .",
    "the three most relevant features of particle candidates of dark matter indirectly deduced from observations are their feeble interactions with standard model particles and with themselves , their sufficiently non - relativistic momentum distribution during structure formation , and their stability on cosmological time - scales .    weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) provide a simple model realising all these features .",
    "firstly , their interactions are of electroweak strength due to the large mass of the mediator particles ( such as w or z bosons ) .",
    "secondly , being thermally produced in the early universe , their large mass , of order the electroweak scale , ensures that they are sufficiently cold at the epoch when structure formation begins .",
    "thirdly , their stability is ensured by invoking symmetries that conserve their particle number . however , motivating such symmetries on theoretical grounds is non - trivial : global symmetries may be broken in quantum gravity , whereas local symmetries lead to additional interactions which may cause conflicts with the required weakness of the dark matter interactions . nevertheless , well - motivated wimp candidates exist , most notably in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model with r - parity conservation .",
    "in fact , in the case that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is a neutralino  a mixture of the supersymmetric partners of neutral standard model gauge bosons and higgses  the latter qualifies for a wimp .",
    "the prospects of exploring the electroweak scale with the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has understandably focused the dark matter searches on the wimp paradigm in the last years and the experimental community has devoted relatively little effort to explore other possibilities .",
    "although it is way too early to make a final judgement it is nevertheless noteworthy that the initial searches at the lhc as well as direct searches for wimp dark matter have not given any clear indication of their existence . because of this shortcoming and the mentioned theoretical issues it is interesting and timely to consider alternative ways to realise the essential features of dark matter",
    ". in this review",
    ", we will concentrate on very weakly interacting slim ( in the sense of very light ) particles ( wisps ) as well motivated dark matter alternatives to wimps .",
    "in fact , sufficient stability of the dark matter particles can also be achieved by combining the weakness of their interactions with a sufficiently small mass .",
    "the latter drastically reduces the phase space and the number and types of possible decay products , thereby increasing the lifetime .",
    "furthermore , there are non - thermal means for producing sufficiently cold dark matter made of light particles , one of the most generic being the vacuum - realignment mechanism , discussed originally in the case of the qcd axion  a theoretically very well motivated basic paradigm of a wisp because it is predicted in a generic framework proposed to solve the so - called strong cp problem , providing a satisfactory explanation why the theta - parameter in qcd vanishes within experimental accuracy .",
    "other wisps , which go under the name  axion - like particles \" and  hidden sector photons \" , are predicted in certain string theory based extensions of the standard model , in addition to a qcd axion candidate .",

    "a particular strong motivation for the existence of the axion and alps comes from string theory  aiming at the currently most ambitious ultraviolet completion of the standard model , unifying all fundamental forces , including gravity .",

    "their number is related to the topology of the internal manifold , namely to the number of closed submanifolds (  cycles \" ) .",

    "then saxions from the vacuum - realignment mechanism may produce large relic dilution via entropy dumping , thus allowing for much larger values of @xmath28 sometimes as high as approaching the gut scale .",

    "in such scenarios , one might expect eventual direct detection of both relic wimps and relic axions .",
