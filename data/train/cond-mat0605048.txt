    "it is well known that a trapped atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) with attractive interactions is stable if the number of atoms in it is below a critical value , above which collapse occurs @xcite . beneath the collapse threshold ,",
    "the bec can form stable wave packets in a one - dimensional ( 1d )  cigar - shaped \" trap , which is tightly confined in two ( transverse ) directions , and is unbound along the longitudinal axis . in that case , the stability of bright solitons is provided by balance between the quantum pressure , alias matter - wave ( mw ) dispersion , and mean - field attraction . a single mw soliton khaykovich02 and trains of interacting solitons @xcite have been created in the cigar - shaped optical traps . however , while the trapping geometry was nearly one - dimensional , the solitons themselves were far from being 1d objects .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a stable soliton was only possible if its longitudinal size exceeded the transverse size by no more than @xmath2 ( note that the situation was affected by an expulsive axial potential , unavoidable in the specific experimental setup ) .",
    "recently , it was shown that the proximity of the soliton to being a 3d object strongly affects its properties , such as the character of its motion @xcite and interactions @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was demonstrated that a moving soliton immersed in a cloud of thermal atoms is subjected to a temperature - dependent friction force @xcite .",
    "a collision between two solitons , which are by themselves stable , in a confined geometry may readily lead to collapse , if the total number of atoms in the soliton pair exceeds the above - mentioned critical value , and the phase difference between the solitons is ( close to ) zero @xcite .",
    "the significance of the effective dimensionality of mw solitary pulses is further emphasized by the recent observation of formation of a set of nearly-3d mutually repulsive mw solitons ( with a phase shift of @xmath3 between them ) as a result of incomplete collapse in an attractive bec with the number of atoms _ several times larger _ than the critical value cornish06 , adams06 .",
    "in addition to being a profoundly important object of fundamental studies , mw solitary waves are also natural candidates for applications , such as high - precision atom interferometry and quantum - information processing .",
    "thus , a thorough understanding of deviations of their behavior from that of ideal 1d solitons is important in this respect too .",
    "in this paper we report results of theoretical investigation of the shape of stationary mw solitons and binary collisions between them in the quasi-1d regime , with the aim to identify manifestations of nonsolitonic behavior due to the residual multi - dimensionality .",
    "the effect of the tightly confined transverse dimensions is taken into account through a perturbative _ self - focusing _ quintic term added to the corresponding one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , as per refs . @xcite and brand06 . in section",
    "ii , we introduce this extended gpe , find a family of its exact one - soliton solutions , and demonstrate stability of the _ entire family _ , _ _",
    "_ _ despite the fact that collapse occurs in the 1d equation with the quintic self - focusing term . in section iii , we investigate soliton collisions within the framework of this equation . on the contrary to completely elastic collisions between solitons in the cubic gpe ( alias cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation , nlse ) , in the presence of the quintic term colliding solitons with zero phase difference , @xmath4 , merge into a single pulse if their relative velocity is smaller than a critical value , @xmath5 .",
    "we find the dependence of @xmath0 on the strength of the transverse confinement and number of atoms in the solitons .",
    "for moderate quintic nonlinearity , good agreement with an analytic prediction derived from the perturbation theory is found . with a stronger quintic term ,",
    "the numerical results deviate from the perturbation theory , although not dramatically .",
    "finally , we demonstrate dynamical symmetry breaking between identical solitons colliding with @xmath6 ( in that case , the merger does not occur ) , as a function of the relative velocity .",
    "an explanation to the latter effect is proposed .",
    "it is based on estimation of a symmetry - breaking parameter , which is a mismatch between the _ amplitude center _ and _ phase center _ of the soliton pair with @xmath7 ( exact definitions are given below ) .",
    "reasonably good agreement between numerical results and the analytical approximation is observed .",
    "the paper is concluded by section iv .",

    "transition to the quasi-1d description is possible if the change of the chemical potential due to the mean - field interaction is much smaller than the level spacing in the transverse trapping potential .",

    "other approaches to the derivation of the effective 1d gpe were also proposed @xcite . in particular , a more complex equation with nonpolynomial ( algebraic ) nonlinearity was derived , by means of the variational approach to the separation of the axial and transverse wave functions , in ref .",
    "@xcite . expanding the nonlinearity up to the quintic term ,",

    "( [ gg ] ) , this conclusion does not depend on the sign of scattering length @xmath31 , i.e. , on the self - focusing or defocusing character of the cubic term ; the same conclusion follows from the expansion of the above - mentioned nonpolynomial nlse derived in ref .",

    "in fact , if the cubic nonlinearity is self - focusing , i.e. , the scattering length is negative ( the case considered throughout the present work ) , the presence of the collapse is a relevant qualitative feature of the effective gpe , as collapse takes place too in the full 3d equation , from which eq .",
    "( [ gpequintic ] ) was derived ( even if the _ strong collapse _ in the full 3d gpe and _ weak collapse _ in the 1d cq equation bear essential differences ) . as shown in refs .",

    "( [ max ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ normcq ] ) shows that condition @xmath58 holds for the entire soliton family ( see also the upper panel in fig .",

    "this criterion is only a necessary one , but not sufficient , the stability of the solitons was tested in systematic direct simulations of eq .",
    "( [ gpedless ] ) .",
    "results clearly suggest that _ all _ the solitons are indeed stable against small perturbations ( of course , a large perturbation may provoke onset of the collapse ) .",
    "it is relevant to mention that the 1d gpe with the full algebraic nonlinearity introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite gives rise to _ two branches _ of ( implicit ) soliton solutions , one stable and one unstable ; the branches meet and disappear at the point of transition to collapsing solutions .",
    "equation ( [ gpedless ] ) does not give rise to the second branch , as the combination of the cubic and quintic terms may be regarded as a truncated expansion of the full algebraic nonlinearity from the above - mentioned equation , and this truncation does not pick up the unstable branch .",
    "it may also be relevant to note that , starting the derivation of the effective 1d equation from the 3d  gpe with the positive scattering length ( corresponding to self - repulsive bec ) , one will arrive at eq .",
    "( [ gpedless ] ) with @xmath59 ( and again with @xmath37 ) .",
    "the corresponding equation , featuring competition between the cubic self - focusing and quintic self - defocusing terms , has a family of exact soliton solutions given by the same expressions ( [ cqsolution])-([normcq ] ) , in which @xmath60 is negative , as per eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) . despite the formal similarity",

    "entire family _ is unstable , according to the vk criterion [ algebraic solitons , such as one in eq .",
    "( [ mu=0 ] ) , are known to be unstable for a different reason @xcite ] .",
    "besides the fact that all the solitons in the model with the positive scattering length are unstable , their physical meaning is doubtful also because the quintic term , which appears as a perturbative correction to the cubic one @xcite , actually dominates over it in these solutions .",
    "it is commonly known that collisions between solitons in the one - dimensional nlse , which is an integrable equation , are completely elastic .",
    "the force of interaction between the solitons depends on the relative phase between them : with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , they are attract and repel each other , respectively @xcite .",
    "the quintic term breaks the integrability of the equation , and is expected to make collisions inelastic . for @xmath65 , simulations reveal a critical collision velocity , below which two identical solitons merge into a single one .",
    "the merger may be explained by the fact that radiation loss due to the inelastic collision becomes greater than the initial kinetic energy of the soliton pair @xcite .",
    "this explanation can be implemented in an explicit form if the quintic term is treated as a small perturbation . to this end , defining @xmath67 , we rewrite eq .",

    "( energyloss ) and ( [ numberloss ] ) , are actually acquired by originally quiescent ( or slowly moving ) solitons due to their mutual attraction ( if @xmath86 is close to zero ) . to this purpose",
    ", we note that the effective potential of the interaction between far separated identical solitons is , in the case of @xmath70 , @xmath87@xcite , and the effective mass of the soliton is @xmath88 . in this approximation",

    "substituting this velocity in eq .",
    "( [ energyloss ] ) shows that the phase - dependent part is less than @xmath92 of the phase - independent one , and therefore we neglect it .",

    "the energy of a free soliton and its norm ( number of atoms ) , in the @xmath95 limit , are @xmath96 ( the negative term in @xmath97 is the binding energy ) .",
    "first , the norm loss , @xmath98 , taken from eq .",
    "( [ collisionloss ] ) , gives rise to the collision - induced change of the soliton s amplitude : @xmath99 .",

    "( [ solitonenergy ] ) , @xmath102 , this condition means that the merger is expected if the initial velocity of each soliton falls below a critical value : @xmath103the derivation of the merger threshold implies that the critical velocity is much smaller than the above - mentioned self - acquired velocity , @xmath104 ( then , the initial velocities of the solitons may be disregarded in the above energy - balance analysis , in comparison with @xmath105 , as it was actually done ) .",
    "expression ( [ criticalvelocity ] ) indeed satisfies condition @xmath106 , as @xmath107 is a small parameter .      for simulations of soliton collisions in eq .",

    "however , we did not include any external longitudinal potential , in contrast to the expulsive potential that was present in the experiment .",
    "recall that the expulsive potential made the soliton stability region very small @xcite , and actually caused the soliton to be very close to the 3d limit .",
    "the present simulations do not include the external potential because we are interested not in effects produced by such a potential , but rather in small deviations from the one - dimensionality .",
    "in fact , a modification of the above - mentioned experimental setup , with the aim to make the central segment of the cigar - shaped trap free of any tangible axial potential , is quite possible .    to compare the analytical prediction for the critical velocity , given by eq .",
    "( [ criticalvelocity ] ) , to numerical results , it is necessary to express perturbative parameter @xmath107 in terms of the transverse trapping frequency @xmath12 . undoing the above renormalizations ,",
    "one arrives at a conclusion that eq .",

    "( [ vcepsilon ] ) yields @xmath115 , which demonstrates a small but tangible deviation from the power law corresponding to the perturbation limit .",

    "( [ vcnumber ] ) , this dependence is indeed observed at smaller values of @xmath33 ( i.e. , for weaker nonlinearity ) , where the perturbation limit should naturally be valid .",
    "perusal of numerical data shows that , in this range , the actual collision - induced radiation loss is very small , and , as a result , the merger does not lead to complete fusion of the colliding solitons into a single pulse , but rather to formation of a bound state of two solitons (  weak merger \" ) , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ weakmergerprofiles ] .",
    "namely , after the first collision , the solitons re - emerge as two distinct wave packets which then collide again many times .",
    "a similar nearly radiationless inelastic collision , leading to the formation of a two - soliton loosely bound state , was recently observed in simulations of a weakly discrete cubic nlse @xcite .",
    "a definite deviation from the @xmath117 dependence is observed in fig .",
    "[ vcnumber ] for @xmath118 , which shows a limitation of the perturbative predictions . in this regime of strong nonlinearity ,",
    "a smooth transition in the collision process occurs , from the formation of the above - mentioned long - lived bound state to direct (  strong \" ) merger of two solitons into a single pulse , which is accompanied by a burst of radiation .",
    "the conspicuous loss of matter with the radiation prevents the emerging single pulse from having the number of atoms above the collapse threshold , therefore the pulse _ does not _ blow up .",
    "the transition is expressed in reduction of the life time of the loose bound state before the complete merger . in fig .",
    "strongmergerprofiles , which represents the strongest nonlinearity included in the present framework , the bound state features only two oscillations .    for even stronger nonlinearities ( which were also considered ) , the power - law dependence of @xmath0 on the number of atoms and transverse trapping frequency is observed in the form of @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively . however , in such an extreme regime , the relevance of the quasi-1d model is questionable . in any case , these results convey a clear caveat to soliton experiments , in which relative variations in the atom number may be as large as @xmath121 : the strong power - law dependence of the critical velocity on the number of atoms should be taken into account , to avoid occasional merger of solitons .",
    "we proceed to inelastic collisions of identical solitons with the phase difference of @xmath123 .",
    "numerical simulations of eq .",
    "( [ gpedless ] ) show a salient effect of symmetry breaking in this case : while the solitons separate after the collision , they emerge as two pulses with _ different amplitudes _ ( then , the velocities are also different , to comply with the momentum conservation ) , as shown in fig . asymmetryprofiles .",
    "it should be mentioned that a similar effect was observed in simulations of collisions between identical solitons in some other nonintegrable 1d models , chiefly in those describing transmission of nonlinear optical pulses , within the framework of the coupled - mode theory , in waveguides equipped with bragg gratings . in that context , the collision - induced symmetry breaking was reported in basic single - core models @xcite , and in more sophisticated dual - core ones ssb - dual - core .",

    "however , two notable deviations are observed : a nonsmooth shape of the numerical curve ( local modulations near the maximum , which tend to give rise to two extra local maxima , definitely exceed an error of the numerical simulations ) , and a weakly decaying tail , which implies that the asymmetry generated by collisions between fast solitons is essentially larger than predicted by the above model .",
    "note that the analytical model does not include radiation loss .",
    "the latter may enhance the asymmetry , as the loss itself is , plausibly , asymmetric too .",

    "two identical in - phase solitons merge into a single pulse , if the collision velocity is smaller than a critical value .",
    "in fact , two different types of the merger were observed ,  strong \" and  weak \" ones , the former leading to the formation of a loose bound state of two solitons that feature repeated collisions , with very weak radiation loss , while the latter means direct fusion into a single pulse , which is accompanied by a burst of radiation ( in that case , the radiation loss helps the emerging pulse to drop the number of atoms below the collapse threshold , and thus avoid the blowup ) .",

    "<S> dependence of @xmath1 on the strength of the transverse confinement and number of atoms in the solitons is predicted by means of the perturbation theory and investigated in direct simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations also demonstrate symmetry breaking in collisions of identical solitons with a nonzero phase difference . this effect is qualitatively explained by means of an analytical approximation . </S>"
