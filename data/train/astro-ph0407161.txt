    "to date , maser lines of five molecular species , those of ch , oh , h@xmath0o , sio , and h@xmath0co , have been detected in extragalactic space . while the number of observed oh masers , @xmath4100 ,",
    "is largest , the greatest emphasis of astrophysical research is focused on h@xmath0o .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the 6@xmath55@xmath6 line of interstellar water vapor at 22.235ghz ( @xmath7@xmath41.3 cm ) , first detected towards orion - kl , sgrb2 and w49 ( ) and , outside the galaxy , towards the nearby spiral m33 ( ) , can be efficiently used to pinpoint sites of massive star formation and to elucidate the properties of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the line traces dense ( @xmath8(h@xmath0)@xmath910@xmath10@xmath11 ) warm ( @xmath12@xmath9400k ) molecular gas .",
    "characteristic properties are enormous brightness temperatures ( @xmath410@xmath13k has been measured ) , small sizes of individual hotspots ( @xmath1410@xmath15 cm in galactic sources ) and narrow linewidths ( typically a few kms@xmath16 ) that make these masers to ideal probes of the structure and dynamics of the gas in which they reside . because the apparent isotropic luminosity of these masers can be truly outstanding , reaching 10@xmath17 l@xmath3 ( up to 10@xmath18 photons / s ) in the most extreme cases , h@xmath0o masers can be observed out to fairly large distances ( up to c@xmath19@xmath417700kms@xmath16 ; ) .",
    "in the galaxy , h@xmath0o masers from star forming regions have isotropic luminosities of order @xmath20 @xmath14 10@xmath21l@xmath3 , with the notable exception of w49 ( @xmath20 @xmath4 1l@xmath3 ) .",
    "the more luminous of these sources consist of a number of hotspots ( see brand et al . , this volume ) . in nearby galaxies , masers with similar luminosities , the so - called kilomasers ,",
    "are also found with luminosities up to a few l@xmath3 .",
    "such masers are important to pinpoint sites of massive star formation ( e.g. ) and to estimate distances on a purely geometric basis , comparing radial velocity and proper motion dispersions in groups of maser spots (; ) . making use of known rotational properties ,",
    "proper motions can also be used to determine three dimensional velocity vectors of entire galaxies ( e.g. ) , thus providing information on the content and distribution of mass inside the local group .",
    "megamasers , with @xmath20@xmath920l@xmath3 , were first observed towards ngc4945 ( ) and then in ngc1068 , ngc3079 , ngc4258 and the circinus galaxy (; ; ; ) .",
    "two of these masers , those of ngc1068 and ngc4258 , were soon found to be located in the innermost few parsecs of their parent galaxies ( ) .",
    "selection criteria to find more such masers as well as an interpretation of the molecular line emission in terms of properties characterizing the nuclear environment of agn remained , however , elusive for a full decade . a large survey including @xmath4360 seyfert and liner galaxies ( ) finally led to the identification of another 10 megamasers , thus tripling the number of known sources and permitting , for the first time , a statistical analysis .",
    "all of these masers were found to be associated with seyfert 2 or liner nuclei ( ) . adopting the so - called unified scheme in which seyfert 1s and 2s are identical except for angle of view , h@xmath0o megamaser activity then is related to the large line - of - sight column densities expected when the nuclear tori are viewed edge - on . at least some liner galaxies also contain large column densities of warm dense molecular gas as well as an agn .",
    "is the impact parameter .",
    "the shaded areas denote lines - of - sight with detected maser emission . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the inner and outer radii of the masing disk , @xmath24 marks the distance from its midline ( from greenhill et al .",
    "1995a).,width=283 ]    more detailed studies of the megamaser in ngc4258 not only confirmed the presence of @xmath2510 systemic velocity features at a given time but also led to the detection of two additional h@xmath0o velocity components , @xmath261000kms@xmath16 off the systemic velocity ( ) .",
    "the systemic features show a secular drift , with radial velocities increasing by d@xmath27/d@xmath28@xmath410kms@xmath16yr@xmath16 (; ; ; ) .",
    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) reveals the presence of a warped edge - on keplerian disk of @xmath40.5pc diameter (; ; , ) , as shown in fig.[ngc4258a ] .",
    "its geometry reflects the velocity coherence of the differentially rotating gas along the lines - of - sight towards its front side , its back side and its tangentially viewed regions ( fig.[ngc4258b ] ) as well as possible amplification of the radio continuum of the northern jet by the systemic features .",
    "the positive velocity drift of the systemic component is readily explained by centripetal acceleration , implying that the features arise from the front and not from the back side of the masing disk ( the latter would result in a negative drift ) .",
    "the ` high velocity features ' originate from those parts of the disk seen tangentially . applying the virial theorem yields @xmath29 ^ 2 \\left[\\frac{r}{\\rm mas}\\right ]                \\left[\\frac{d}{\\rm mpc}\\right ] { \\rm m_{\\odot}},\\ ] ] with @xmath30 being the mass enclosed by the keplerian disk , @xmath31 denoting its rotational velocity at angular radius @xmath32 , and @xmath33 representing the distance to the galaxy .",
    "the vlbi maps allow us to directly measure @xmath31 and @xmath32 for various values of @xmath32 . from the keplerian rotation curve",
    "we then obtain @xmath34 \\left[\\frac{r}{\\rm mas}\\right]^{1/2}.\\ ] ] in addition , the observed e - w velocity gradient of the systemic features ( fig.1c ) provides @xmath35 \\left[\\frac{r}{\\rm mas}\\right]^{-1}.\\ ] ] @xmath36/@xmath37 = @xmath38 then gives the angular radius @xmath39 of the systemic features as viewed from a direction in the plane of the disk , but perpendicular to the line - of - sight .",
    "the result , @xmath39@xmath44.1mas , implies that the features are localized toward the inner edge of the disk .",
    "the distance to the disk , needed to estimate @xmath30 in eq.(1 ) , is determined by measuring the centripetal acceleration @xmath40 with d@xmath27/d@xmath28 and the rotational velocity @xmath41 of the systemic components known , the linear scale @xmath42 can be compared with the angular scale , @xmath39 , providing a measure of the distance .",
    "the proper motion of the individual systemic maser spots , 31.5@xmath261.0@xmath43asyr@xmath16 , allows , with @xmath41 being known , a check of this distance estimate .",
    "the results of the two methods agree .",
    "@xmath33=7.2@xmath260.5mpc and @xmath30 = ( 3.9@xmath260.3)@xmath4410@xmath10m@xmath3 within 0.14pc ( ) .",
    "o spectrum of mrk1419 ( ngc2960 ) , taken with the 100-m telescope at effelsberg ( from henkel et al . 2002 ) and showing the characteristic systemic ( center ) , red- and blue - shifted groups of maser features.,width=226 ]    so far , all h@xmath0o megamasers studied interferometrically arise from the innermost parsecs of their parent galaxy and all appear to be associated with agn . searching for ngc4258-like targets showing three groups of h@xmath0o features , one systemic , one red- and",
    "one blue - shifted , has become the holy grail of recent maser surveys .",
    "such a configuration requires not only the presence of very dense molecular gas , but also a suitable viewpoint , with the nuclear disk seen almost edge - on . therefore such sources are rarely found",
    ". nevertheless , the number of detected sources falling into this category is steadily rising ( see e.g. fig.[mrk1419 ] ) . most notable are ic2560 ( 2900kms@xmath16 ; ) and mrk1419 ( 4900kms@xmath16 ; ) . very recently",
    ", four additional sources were identified , one at 7900kms@xmath16 ( ) and three at @xmath2510000kms@xmath16 ( greenhill et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "assuming that the model valid for ngc4258 is generally applicable , single dish observations determining the drift of the systemic components ( d@xmath27/d@xmath28 ) and the velocity offsets to the non - systemic components ( @xmath31 ) are sufficient for a rough estimate of the enclosed mass and linear scale of the disk .",
    "thus it is possible to estimate angular scales of order 1mas observing with resolutions of 3540@xmath45 .",
    "so far , all measured centripetal accelerations are positive .",
    "the most plausible explanations are obscuration of the back side , perhaps by free - free absorption , and a lack of background radio continuum emission that could be amplified .",
    "maser dynamical masses ( @xmath30 ) for a large sample of galaxies have the potential to establish the slope of the @xmath30@xmath46 relation and its intrinsic scatter ( e.g. ) , with uncertainties being dominated by the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath46 .",
    "observing the three dimensional structure of a sample of accretion disks may provide strong constraints on heating ( possibly irradiation by the nuclear x - ray source ) and warping mechanisms ( radiative torques have been proposed ) and on the stability of these structures ( e.g. ) .",
    "the thickness of the respective accretion disk is another important parameter ( e.g. ) , being crucial to calculations of accretion rate and identification of accretion modes ( e.g. advective , convective , viscous ) . determining the mass of the nuclear source , its distance , eddington luminosity and accretion efficiency , the rate and mode of the nuclear accretion flow , the size and geometry of the nuclear disk or torus , the parent galaxy s deviation from the hubble flow and calibrations of optical or near infrared indicators of distance with geometrically obtained values ( see e.g. eqs.14 )",
    "are all attractive goals .",
    "in addition to the sources introduced above , there are a large number of targets exhibiting somewhat less regular spectra .",
    "these may either arise from tori that are unstable to fragmentation and star formation or from sources that combine an edge - on nuclear accretion disk with maser components of different nature that will be discussed below . within this context ,",
    "the most thoroughly studied sources are ngc1068 , ngc3079 and the circinus galaxy (; , , ; ; ; ) .",
    "there are also sources in which at least a part of the h@xmath0o emission is believed to be the result of an interaction between the nuclear radio jet and an encroaching molecular cloud .",
    "the first such source was ngc1068 , where not only the three groups of h@xmath0o components from the accretion disk are seen ( ) , but where a fourth component is also detected .",
    "this originates from a region 03 ( @xmath430pc ) downstream , where the radio jet bends (; ) . to maximize detection rates of jet - maser sources , galaxies",
    "should be selected that either show evidence for interaction between the radio jet and clouds in the narrow line region or that show a face - on ( @xmath47@xmath4835@xmath49 ) large scale galaxy disk and extended ( up to 100pc ) radio structures , indicating that both the disk and the radio jet are fairly close to the plane of the sky .",
    "o spectra towards mrk348 ( ngc262 ; see peck et al .",
    "h@xmath0o emission is only detected towards the northern jet.,width=302 ]    toward the elliptical galaxy ngc1052 the h@xmath0o maser features are located along the line - of - sight to the south - western nuclear jet ( ) . in mrk348 , a spiral galaxy with a particularly strong nuclear radio component , the megamaser appears to be associated with the northern jet ( see fig.[mrk348 ] ; ) .",
    "the intensity of the line emission is correlated with the continuum flux .",
    "the high linewidth ( @xmath4130kms@xmath16 ) on small spatial scales ( @xmath480.25pc ) and the rapid variability indicate that the h@xmath0o emission is more likely to arise from a shocked region at the interface between the energetic jet and the ambient molecular gas than as a result of amplification of the continuum jet by molecular clouds along the line - of - sight .",
    "the line emission , red - shifted by 130kms@xmath16 with respect to the systemic velocity , may arise from gas being entrained by the receding jet .",
    "the close temporal correlation between the flaring activity of the maser and the continuum further suggests that the h@xmath0o and continuum hotspots are nearly equidistant from the central engine and may be different manifestations of the same event .",
    "recently , optically detected large scale outflows were proposed to induce shocks that might trigger h@xmath0o megamaser emission ( ) .",
    "independently , it was found that in the circinus galaxy the h@xmath0o megamaser does not only trace a circumnuclear disk , but that there are also features associated with a wide angle outflow ( ) .",
    "maser emission traces this outflow out to 1pc from the central engine with line - of - sight velocities up to @xmath26160kms@xmath16 w.r.t .",
    "the outflowing wind is observed in those regions around the circumnuclear disk that are not shadowed by its warp .",
    "the position angles of the edges of the outflow correspond to those of the outflow and ionization cones observed at radio and optical wavelengths on much larger scales (; ) .",
    "thus in addition to accretion disk and jet megamasers , strong maser emission can also be associated with large scale nuclear outflows .",
    "yet another kind of h@xmath0o megamaser might be associated with massive star formation .",
    "so far there is not yet a confirmed source . towards arp299 , an interacting pair of galaxies",
    ", luminous h@xmath0o megamaser emission was detected that might be associated with star formation in the overlapping region between its main members ngc3690 and ic694 ( ) . this possibility has , however , to be confirmed by interferometric measurements .    as suggested by sect.2 , most h@xmath0o kilomasers are associated with star formation .",
    "there are , however , exceptions . towards m51 ,",
    "the kilomaser was found to coincide with the nucleus within 250mas ( @xmath410pc ; ) . a similarly good coincidence , within 1@xmath45 ( @xmath412pc ) ,",
    "was also found for the main maser component in the starburst galaxy ngc253 ( ) .",
    "the nature of these sources that are too weak to be seen at distances well in excess of 10mpc is still under discussion .",
    "almost a decade ago , all h@xmath0o megamasers were found to be associated with seyfert 2 and liner galaxies ( ) . in the meantime , however , with a much larger number of detections , the situation has become more complex . while megamasers are detected in optically ` normal ' galaxies ( ) , a particularly luminous megamaser was recently found in the frii radio galaxy 3c403 ( ) .",
    "another megamaser host , ngc5506 , was identified as a narrow line seyfert 1 ( ) . the detection of a nuclear kilomaser in a second such galaxy , ngc4051 ( ) , was interpreted in terms of a relatively low inclination of the nuclear disk or torus w.r.t seyfert 2 galaxies , thus yielding relatively low column densities for coherent amplification .",
    "even more recently , h@xmath0o was detected in the prototypical seyfert 1 ngc4151 ( ) .",
    "it is still too early for a detailed interpretation , but it is clear that these detections will be essential for a better understanding of the unifying scheme differentiating between type 1 and type 2 agn .",
    "is there a way to predict the presence of h@xmath0o megamasers by observations at other wavelengths ?",
    "this question was recently discussed for the prototypical sources ngc1068 , ngc3079 and ngc4258 ( ) . all three galaxies exhibit a spatially compact ( @xmath141@xmath45 ) near infrared core containing dust clouds that are heated by the central engine",
    ". this appears to be the main hint for the potential presence of accretion disk masers , but these cores are more difficult to detect than the masers themselves .",
    "tracers for jet masers at optical and near infrared wavelengths are spectral lines that are split into two velocity components .",
    "though the sensitivity of existing facilities can be slightly enhanced , order(s ) of magnitude improvements will only be possible with the square kilometer array ( ska ) , complemented by space interferometry to combine optimal sensitivity with optimal angular resolution .",
    "the 22ghz line of water vapor bears the prospect to reveal the magnetic field strength through its zeeman pattern .",
    "a measurement towards ngc4258 yielded a 1@xmath46 upper limit of 300 mg for the toroidal component ( ) .",
    "probably only the ska will provide the sensitivity to determine the magnetic field in the circumnuclear environment of active galaxies .",
    "the same may hold for searches of h@xmath0o megamasers at cosmological redshifts . on the other hand , accounting for the statistical properties of detected maser sources , it appears that existing facilities have the potential to drastically enlarge the number of known luminous sources of h@xmath0o emission .",
    "so far , possibly only a small percentage of the detectable megamasers have been found ( ) .",
