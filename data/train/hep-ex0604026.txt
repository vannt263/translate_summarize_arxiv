    "an upsilon ( @xmath3 ) meson is a composite particle consisting of a bottom quark ( @xmath4 ) and an anti - bottom quark ( @xmath5 ) bound with their spins aligned in a @xmath6 quantum mechanical wavefunction , where @xmath7 is the total angular momentum .",
    "this meson is a nuclear analogy of ortho - positronium in atomic physics .",
    "the di - electron width is the rate of @xmath3  decay into an electron / positron pair , and measuring it provides unique experimental access to the physical size of the @xmath8 wavefunction and its total decay rate the average extension of the @xmath3  meson in both space and time .",
    "the @xmath8 system , also known as bottomonium , is the most non - relativistic system of quarks bound by the nuclear strong force .",
    "this is because the bottom quark is the heaviest quark that can participate in the strong force , the top decaying immediately into bottom by the electroweak force . unlike much more abundant protons and neutrons , whose masses consist almost entirely of the kinetic energy of the constituent quarks and gluons , 94% of the mass of the lightest @xmath3  consists of the mass of its two bottom quarks",
    "this simplifies the dynamics of bottomonium and even permits description in terms of a potential , making it a good testing ground for strong force calculations .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has long been accepted as the correct description of the nuclear strong force ( with possible modifications only at tev energies and above ) because of its success in predicting scattering interactions above one gev and its qualitative explanation of low - energy phenomena like quark confinement .",
    "today , the lattice qcd technique , which simulates qcd on a computer , is yielding few - percent calculations of low - energy phenomena from first principles in particular , @xmath3  properties such as the di - electron widths .",
    "precise experimental knowledge of the @xmath3  di - electron widths will test the new lattice qcd techniques that made this advance possible .",
    "the di - electron widths check lattice qcd in a way that is key for electroweak physics .",
    "the cp violation parameters @xmath9  and @xmath10 , fundamental constants in the standard model , could be extracted from existing hadronic measurements much more precisely if the strength of the force between quarks were better known .",
    "lattice qcd can help , but precise lattice results will only be trusted if similar calculations can be experimentally verified .",
    "the @xmath3  di - electron width closely resembles the factor that limits our knowledge of @xmath9 , and thus will provide a cross - check that will either lend credence to or cast doubt on the @xmath9  extraction .",
    "di - electron widths of the @xmath3  resonances have been measured before , but not with the precision that is now being demanded by lattice qcd .",
    "this document represents a comprehensive study of the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13  di - electron widths , with 50 times the data of any previous measurement .",
    "we present di - electron width measurements of the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13  with 1.5% , 1.8% , and 1.8% total uncertainty , respectively .",
    "this is the second - ever measurement of the @xmath13di - electron width , improving its precision by a factor of five .",
    "furthermore , measuring all three resonances in the same study permits us to derive very precise ratios of di - electron widths , where the tightest constraint on theory is likely to be . without this measurement ,",
    "comparisons with lattice qcd would probably be limited by experiment .",
    "the @xmath4-quark and the @xmath5-quark in bottomonium attract each other by the nuclear strong force , which in qcd is mediated by gluons , the nuclear analogy of virtual photons .",
    "the two quarks are charged with opposite `` colors , '' in a quantum mechanical superposition of red / anti - red , blue / anti - blue , and green / anti - green states , which are constantly traded for each other by the doubly - colored gluons .",
    "( the exchange of a red / anti - green gluon will turn a red / anti - red @xmath8 system green / anti - green , for instance .",
    "see figure  [ gluejunk](a ) . )",
    "because the gluons carry color charge , they can interact with other gluons and spawn complicated networks of interactions between the two quarks ( figure  [ gluejunk](b ) ) , which increases the interaction strength with distance .",
    "bottom quarks are usually separated by a femtometer , and at this distance scale , the coupling constant of qcd is of order unity .",
    "feynman diagrams with many vertices are not suppressed relative to simple diagrams , and therefore a calculation of the force between the two quarks does not submit to a perturbative expansion .     (",

    "grey shading indicates the sum of all such amplitudes . ]    a very successful model of the force between @xmath4 and @xmath5 consists of a coulomb - like potential at short distances ( though about 50 times stronger ) and a linear potential at large distances ( which limits to a constant force of about 14 tons ) , as illustrated in figure  [ cornellpotential](a ) @xcite . at large distances ,",
    "a string of self - interacting gluons , stretched between the two quarks , is responsible for the linear component .",
    "this string will generate a real quark / anti - quark pair and snap if stretched with sufficient energy .",
    "there are three @xmath6 solutions to the schrdinger equation below this threshold : they are labeled @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",

    "these three mass eigenstates are the bottomonium equivalent of atomic energy levels discrete lines of allowed mass - energies .",
    "but , just as in atomic spectra , the short lifetimes of these states imply a broadening of their spectral lines : they are not perfect time - independent solutions .",
    "the full - width of an @xmath3  resonance at half - maximum , @xmath15 , is equal to its decay rate , in analogy with excited atomic resonances .",
    "if we partition the @xmath3  decays into distinguishable modes , one being @xmath16 , the total decay rate is a sum of those modes .",
    "hence , @xmath17 , where @xmath18  is the di - electron width and @xmath19  is the fraction of @xmath3  mesons that decay to @xmath20 , that is , the branching fraction to @xmath20 .",

    "@xmath22 where @xmath23 , the @xmath4-quark electric charge , @xmath24 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant and @xmath25 is the @xmath3mass @xcite .",
    "this is a non - relativistic approximation : relativistic corrections replace the wavefunction at the origin with an integral of values very close to the origin . because of this dependence on knowledge of the @xmath8 wavefunction , and therefore the potential , a first - principles calculation @xmath18  will require non - perturbative qcd .     decay diagram of @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath27 contribution is 0.25% of the total rate . ]",
    "feynman path integrals provide a general approach to quantum field theory that do nt rely on a perturbative expansion . in this formalism , the amplitude of a process is calculated as a weighted sum of all possible ways it can proceed .",
    "the value of every field at every point in space in the initial state is allowed to vary as an arbitrary function of time to the final state , and these paths are weighted by their action .",
    "this is a generalization of lagrange s method in classical physics , in which the true path is the one which minimizes action . in quantum physics , all paths which nearly minimize action contribute to the amplitude of a process ( figure  [ pathintegrals](a ) ) .",
    "( a ) paths in field strength ( @xmath28 ) versus time .",
    "the minimum ( white ) is the classical solution and the path which contributes the most to the quantum amplitude ; shades of grey represent other quantum paths with smaller contributions to the total amplitude .",
    "( b ) a path approximated by a discrete time sequence . ]    to calculate a sum over a set of arbitrary paths , one must discretize space - time into time slices and space cubes .",
    "the path of a field value in a space cube from the initial state to the final state is a sequence of values for each time slice ( figure  [ pathintegrals](b ) ) .",
    "a sequence of @xmath29 values is a vector in an @xmath29-dimensional vector space : the weighting factor is integrated over these vector spaces . to obtain a realistic result , one must afterward limit the discretization scale to zero .    in general ,",
    "realistic problems like qcd , the integral will not be analytic and must be solved by numerical integration",
    ". the integral will have a fixed number of dimensions , which implies a fixed discretization of space - time that can only be lifted by extrapolating several calculations toward zero lattice size .",
    "this discretization is the lattice of lattice qcd .",
    "quark field values are represented on a four - dimensional lattice of space - time points with gluon field values on the edges connecting them .",
    "this is a very computationally intensive problem , since the number of dimensions in the integral scales with the number of grid points , and one must maximize the number of grid points to extrapolate to the continuum limit .",
    "over the past 30 years , theorists have improved the algorithms of lattice qcd and sought approximations to make realistic calculations tractable .",
    "the most time - consuming part of most lattice qcd calculations is the polarization of the vacuum by light quarks . in terms of feynman diagrams , these are interruptions of a gluon propagator by loops of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 pairs , which can be ignored or suppressed by assuming infinite or very heavy up , down , and strange quark masses ( figure [ vacuumpolarization ] ) .",
    "this approximation is known as the quenched approximation , and it permits calculations with 1020% systematic uncertainties .     vacuum polarization by light quarks . ]",
    "this situation was dramatically improved in the late 1990 s by the development of new algorithms based on the symanzik - improved staggered - quark formalism @xcite .",
    "these algorithms are by far the most efficient known , and the formalism features an exact chiral symmetry that particularly benefits simulations with small light quark masses .",
    "realistic up and down quark masses are still out of reach , but simulations using masses three times too large can be accurately extrapolated with chiral perturbation theory . thus , `` unquenched '' calculations are now possible , resulting in the accurate prediction of many masses and decay rates , as demonstrated in figure  [ latticevictory ] .     lattice qcd calculations divided by experimental measurements for nine quantities , without and with quark vacuum polarization ( left and right panels , respectively ) .",
    "( the notation @xmath33 refers to the mass difference between @xmath34 and @xmath11 . ) ]    this algorithmic speed comes at a conceptual price : the staggered - quark formalism introduces four equivalent species of each quark field , called `` tastes . ''",
    "these are artifacts of the formalism and are unrelated to quark flavor .",
    "each of these tastes contributes to the vacuum polarization , resulting in loop contributions which are four times too large .",
    "to correct for this , the quark determinant in the action is replaced by its fourth root , a procedure which is rigorous in the free - field theory and in perturbative qcd , but introduces violations of lorentz symmetry at short distances in the lattice simulation .",
    "although these non - physical effects can be removed by interpolating between the lattice points with perturbative qcd , this issue makes the new algorithms controversial , and it is one aspect that will be tested by confrontations with experiment .    the di - electron width may be determined from @xmath3  simulations by extracting the @xmath8 wavefunction at the origin and applying equation  [ eqn : waveatorigin ] . in a path",
    "integral context , the wavefunction is the quark field amplitude .",
    "these simulations employ a non - relativistic qcd action with relativistic corrections ( nrqcd ) , because the de broglie wavelength of a massive @xmath4 quark would require impractically narrow time slices .",
    "simulations of the @xmath3  mesons have been generated by the hpqcd collaboration , but the determination of @xmath18  from them is not yet complete @xcite . to properly calculate @xmath18 , one needs to correct the lattice wavefunction for discretization effects through a constant , @xmath35 , that matches the lattice approximations of the virtual photon current to a continuum renormalization scheme .",
    "the leading term in @xmath35 is on the order of the strong coupling constant @xmath36 , about 20% .",
    "this calculation is in progress .",
    "however , @xmath35 largely cancels in ratios of @xmath18 : for instance , @xmath18  from the @xmath12  divided by @xmath18  from the @xmath11  can already be extracted with a 10% uncertainty .",
    "@xmath37 this uncertainty is primarily due to residual discretization errors , evident from the steep dependence of the result on lattice spacing size ( figure  [ latticespacing ] ) .",
    "when the discretization correction has been calculated , the uncertainty in this ratio should be only a few percent , while absolute @xmath18  values should have uncertainties on the 10%-level .",
    "this is why experimentally precise ratios of @xmath18  are also valuable .",
    "the ratios test the nrqcd treatment of the @xmath4 quarks with high precision , though they are less sensitive to the @xmath35 corrections .",
    "hpqcd calculations of @xmath38 times the ratio of masses squared as a function of lattice grid size @xmath39 .",
    "square data points represent calculations with light quark masses close to their natural values , and triangular points are quenched ( infinite light quark masses ) . ]",
    "lattice verification of @xmath18  is particularly significant for an application of the technique to electroweak physics .",
    "vertices in feynman diagrams that join a top quark , a down quark , and a @xmath40 boson contribute an a priori unknown factor , @xmath9 , to the amplitude ( figure  [ vtdvertex ] ) .",
    "this parameter is a fundamental constant in the standard model and is essential for violation of charge - parity ( cp ) symmetry : if @xmath9  were zero , the standard model would be cp symmetric ( exchanging particles for antiparticles and mirror - transforming space would preserve all observables ) . to determine @xmath9",
    ", one must resort to measurements of bound quark systems , because bare quarks do not exist in nature .",
    "the transition rates for these systems depend both on @xmath9  and on qcd factors related to the structure of the bound state .",
    "lattice qcd can calculate these factors and thereby extract @xmath9 .",

    "these two mesons can mix , that is , a @xmath42 can transform into a @xmath43 and vice - versa , through the diagram illustrated in figure  [ bmixing](a ) .",
    "the heavy top quark dominates in this loop and provides a factor of @xmath9  for each vertex with a down quark .",

    ", the average distance between the @xmath4 and @xmath51 quarks is set by the qcd potential ( @xmath50fm ) , just as it is for @xmath8 in the @xmath3  meson . just as in @xmath18 , the rate of @xmath42-@xmath43 mixing is determined by the probability that the two quarks will fluctuate to the same point in space , and this probability is characterized by the @xmath52 meson decay constant @xmath49 . @xmath53",
    "the @xmath42-@xmath43 mixing amplitude depends on two factors of @xmath49 , one from the @xmath42 wavefunction and the other from @xmath43 ( see figure  [ bmixing](b ) ) .",
    "another factor , known as the bag parameter @xmath54 , corrects for gluons connecting the @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( figure  [ bmixing](c ) ) .",
    "its uncertainty is more easily controlled .",
    "our knowledge of @xmath9  is therefore dominated by the uncertainty in  @xmath49 .    in principle , one can measure @xmath49 experimentally through @xmath55 or @xmath56 , illustrated in figure  [ btomunu ] .",
    "the charged @xmath57 has different quark content from the neutral @xmath42 , but its decay rate depends on @xmath49 because up and down quark masses are both much smaller than the bottom quark mass , and flavors do not enter the qcd calculation .",

    "s perspective , the only difference between these two calculations is the mass of one of the two quarks : a bottom quark is replaced by a light quark .",
    "this is not a trivial distinction : it is also worthwhile checking the lattice calculation of the @xmath65 meson decay constant , in which a charm quark and a light quark annihilate , with experimental results from cleo - c that are now becoming available @xcite .",
    "the @xmath65 meson is a heavy / light quark combination , just like the @xmath52 meson , so @xmath66 is physically more analogous to @xmath49 than @xmath18  is .",
    "however , the @xmath65 meson is a more relativistic system , the charm quark being four times lighter than bottom , so instead of simulating charm quarks with nrqcd , the @xmath65 meson simulations use a relativistic approximation known as the fermilab action @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath18  tests the treatment of heavy quarks in the @xmath49 calculation and @xmath66 tests the heavy - light simulation and matching the virtual @xmath41 current to the continuum with @xmath60 . ratios of @xmath18  are particularly applicable to this test , since they will be more sensitive to the treatment of heavy quarks than to @xmath35 in @xmath18 .",

    "the @xmath136 branching fraction is therefore 0.25% , and @xmath137 is 0.05% , which is negligible at our level of precision .",

    "in this chapter , we present the apparatus we used to collide electrons and positrons and collect @xmath3  decay products .      our electron - positron pairs collided in the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) , a 768  m - circumference , symmetric storage ring and collider in ithaca ,  ny .",
    "this collider covers a very broad range of @xmath20  energies , from the charmonium region at @xmath154 1.8  gev through the excited @xmath3states at 5.5  gev .",
    "the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13  masses , between 4.7 and 5.2  gev , lie in cesr s optimal range .",
    "in fact , scans of the @xmath11through @xmath13  are among the first data taken by cesr in 1979 ( figure  [ greetingsfromcesr ] ) .",
    "copper dipole magnets confine the beams to their orbits , alternating with quadrapole and sextapole magnets for focusing .",
    "superconducting quadruples provide the final focusing of the beams , only 30  cm from the interaction point , allowing the collisions to reach instantaneous luminosities of @xmath155  @xmath156  s@xmath46 .",
    "like all synchrotrons , the beam is pulsed to permit acceleration : beam bunches are timed to enter radio frequency ( rf ) standing waves just when the electric field is maximal . in cesr ,",
    "nine trains of five bunches circulate in the ring at once , with 1.15@xmath157 particles per bunch . both the electron beam and the positron beam",
    "are enclosed in the same beam - pipe , so they need to be separated electrostatically .",
    "the resulting orbit is called a `` pretzel orbit '' because the beams twine around each other like twisted pair cable .",
    "we determine the beam energy by measuring the magnetic field in two dipole magnets , outside the ring but otherwise identical to the others .",
    "the current supplied to these two test magnets is in series with the beam magnets to assure the same current , and the magnetic field is measured with nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) probes .",
    "the nave beam energy , @xmath158 is then corrected for shifts in the rf frequency , steering and focusing magnet currents , and the voltage of the electrostatic separators .",
    "this full reckoning misses the true beam energy by 0.172% , which is 18  mev in @xmath2  near the @xmath3  masses , but it is very stable with time and tracks beam energy differences with the same precision .",
    "such a beam energy measurement will not improve the world knowledge of @xmath3  masses , but the scale uncertainty is small enough to have negligible impact on the width , and therefore the area , of the resonance scans .",
    "distributions of electron and positron energies in the cesr beam are 0.057% wide at the @xmath11  ( this is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean ) and this width scales linearly with beam energy .",
    "the beam energy distribution is gaussian .",
    "our lineshape data , which is the world s most sensitive test of @xmath20  beam energy distributions near 10  gev , show no deviations from a pure gaussian distribution .",
    "the beam energy spread can vary by as much as 12% a month , due to perturbations in the beams orbits from environmental conditions .",
    "we observed such a shift ( figure  [ beamenergyspread ] ) , coincident with large corrections to the horizontal steering magnets to compensate for the new orbit .",
    "we use records of these changes to track potential shifts in the beam energy spread , and allow shifts in the widths of the lineshapes by adding floating parameters to the fit .",
    "[ pag : beamenergyspread ]     beam energy spread fit results in the center - of - mass ( @xmath159 single beam energy spread ) divided by @xmath2@xmath160 , which is nearly constant , as expected .",

    "the beam - beam interaction region is a ribbon 0.18  mm tall ( out of the ring plane ) , 0.34  mm wide ( in the ring plane but perpendicular to the beam axis ) , and 1.8  cm long ( in the ring , along the beam axis ) .",
    "electrons and positrons may collide anywhere within this constrained distribution , and its center drifts by about 4  mm along the beam - line and 12  mm perpendicular to it on a monthly timescale .",
    "we can easily track these changes .",
    "in addition to @xmath20  collisions , beam particles can interact with gas nuclei inside the beam - pipe and with the wall of the beam - pipe itself ( 2.1  cm in radius ) . to minimize the number of beam - gas events , the beam - pipe is kept evacuated at 24@xmath161  torr .",
    "beam - wall events are minimized by focusing .",
    "the electron and positron currents can vary independently , so electron - induced beam - gas and beam - wall and positron - induced beam - gas and beam - wall rates are not identical .",
    "in fact , we find that positron - induced rates are typically twice electron - induced rates , suggesting a difference in cross - sections .",
    "we collected data in eleven dedicated scans of the @xmath11  and one high - energy point ( 100  mev above the @xmath11  mass ) , totalling 0.09  fb@xmath46 , and added to this 18  fb@xmath46  of subsequent on - resonance peak data ( adjacent in time and limited to 48 hours after the beginning of the scan ) .",

    "our @xmath18  values represent the rate of @xmath16 decays with no photons in the final state , not even very soft photons .",

    "our result does include electromagnetic vacuum polarization , a few - percent effect in which the virtual photon connecting @xmath20  to @xmath3  is interrupted by fermion loops , because this affects the decay process and the production process equally , and we never made any correction to remove it .",

    "this effect was observed for the @xmath168 and @xmath169 mesons in the @xmath83channel within a year of their discovery @xcite @xcite because these charmonium resonances have much larger cross - sections relative to continuum .",

    ".    finally , the @xmath3  di - electron widths are valuable as a test of lattice qcd .",
    "the ratios @xmath172 are especially useful , since the renormalization factor for the virtual photon current , @xmath35 cancels , which allows us to test this aspect of the calculation in isolation .",
    "conversely , the ratios test the rest of the calculation , particularly the nrqcd treatment of @xmath4 quarks and the staggered - quark formalism for virtual light quarks , in isolation and with higher precision than what can be attained with the absolute @xmath18  calculations . these aspects are shared with the calculation of @xmath49 , which is used to extract @xmath9from @xmath42-@xmath43 mixing .",
    "our experimental values of @xmath172 are @xmath173 where we have canceled systematic uncertainties which are shared among the pairs of resonances .",
    "these shared systematics are the common hadronic efficiency and the overall luminosity scale in table  [ tab : systematics ] .",
    "we overlay our @xmath38 experimental result on the hpqcd calculation ( equation  [ eqn : latticeresult ] ) in figure  [ latticespacingagain ] .",
    "we now use our @xmath18  measurements to determine basic parameters of the @xmath3  mesons : their total decay rates ( lifetimes ) and wavefunctions at the origin ( sizes ) .",

    "we see in this the effect of the linear part of the strong force potential : the @xmath13  has more probability density at the origin than it would if its potential were purely coulombic . in the sense that @xmath18  is sensitive to the physical size and shape of the @xmath3  meson",

    "<S> it was karl s idea to measure hadronic efficiency with @xmath1  transitions , and he was very involved in radiative corrections and resonance - continuum interference : in fact , he wrote the routine that we use to compute them both . </S>",
    "<S> rich organized this project at its earliest stages and chaired the committee that oversaw the development of a publication . </S>",
    "<S> brian heltsley , istvan danko , and surik mehrabyan also gave a great deal of input . </S>",
    "<S> i should also note that brian and surik were the primary persons involved in determining integrated luminosity from bhabha counts ( chapter  [ chp : luminosity ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this document quotes their work ( cleo internal note cbx 05 - 17 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> widening the circle , this project could nt even begin without an operational collider and detector ( chapter  [ chp : hardware ] ) , so the entire staff of the cornell electron storage ring and the cleo collaboration in a real way helped to make this analysis possible . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , stu peck tuned the beam to optimize running conditions for every @xmath2  increment , and he was very patient with our special requests . also , mike billing took the time to teach me how to use the beam simulation when i was concerned about changes in beam energy spread .    </S>",
    "<S> it was also helpful ( and stimulating ) to learn about the lattice qcd calculation which motivated our experient . </S>",
    "<S> for this , i thank peter lepage and christine davies for their detailed explainations .    </S>",
    "<S> this work was supported by the a.p .  </S>",
    "<S> sloan foundation , the national science foundation , and the u.s . </S>",
    "<S> department of energy . </S>"
