    "the wide - spread use of highly active antiretroviral therapies ( haart ) against hiv  in  the united states has resulted in reducing the burden of hiv - related morbidity and mortality [ @xcite ] .",
    "hiv dynamics following haart are usually studied in short - term clinical trials with frequent data collection design .",
    "for example , in viral dynamics studies of aids clinical trials the elimination process of plasma virus after treatment is closely monitored with daily measurements , which has led to a new understanding of the pathogenesis of hiv infection and provides guidance for treating aids patients and evaluating antiviral therapies [ @xcite ] . here in this article",
    "hiv dynamics refer to a two - part response to haart : viral suppression and concurrent or subsequent immune reconstitution . in clinical practice ,",
    "the virus is considered suppressed when plasma hiv rna ( viral load ) is below a lower limit of detection ; the degree of immune reconstitution is commonly measured by the change of cd4@xmath0 lymphocyte cell count ( cd4 count ) after haart initiation .",
    "it is well known that cd4@xmath0 lymphocyte cells are targets of hiv and their abundance declines after hiv infection .",
    "investigators have studied the association between viral load and cd4 count during haart treatment and , in general , they are negatively correlated [ @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "longitudinal data on these markers have been analyzed separately , particularly by using random - effects models .",
    "recently , bivariate linear mixed models were proposed to jointly model viral load and cd4 count by incorporating correlated random effects .",
    "these models were specified in terms of concurrent association between viral load and cd4 count [ @xcite ; @xcite ] . however , a  natural time ordering for virologic and immunologic response to haart ( or any antiviral therapy ) is often observed : when a patient begins a successful haart regimen , viral replication is usually inhibited first , leading to a decrease in viral load ; then , cd4 count often increases as the immune system begins to recover .",
    "consequently , increase in cd4 count is thought to depend on the degree of viral suppression ; it may be slower to respond than viral load or it may not increase at all if the virus is not suppressed [ @xcite ] . therefore , it would be advantageous to acknowledge these common sequential changes of viral load and cd4 count when modeling post - haart hiv dynamics .",
    "hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) coinfection is estimated to occur in @xmath1 of hiv - infected patients in the united states and has become one of the most challenging clinical situations to manage in hiv - infected patients [ @xcite ] .",
    "several studies have suggested that hcv serostatus is not associated with the virologic response to haart [ @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "however , the evidence for immunologic response is conflicting .",
    "some studies have shown that hiv ",
    "hcv coinfected patients have a blunted immunologic response to haart , compared to those with hiv infection alone , although others have found comparable degrees of immune reconstitution in persons with hiv ",
    "hcv coinfection [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "a primary motivation of our model is to investigate the effect of hcv coinfection on post - haart hiv dynamics using cohort data from natural history studies .",
    "we focus on two important questions : ( @xmath2 ) do hcv - negative patients have shorter time from haart initiation to viral suppression ? ( @xmath3 )",
    "do hcv - negative patients have better immune reconstitution at the time of viral suppression ?",
    "note that in the second question the sequential nature of the virologic and immunologic response to haart is emphasized .      because the incidence of clinical progression to aids fell rapidly following the widespread introduction of haart in 1997 , long - term clinical trials in patients with hiv become time - consuming and expensive [ @xcite ] .",
    "currently , natural history studies are the major source of knowledge about the hiv epidemic and the full treatment effect of haart over the long term .",
    "for example , studies such as multicenter aids cohort study ( macs ) , women s interagency hiv study ( wihs ) and swiss hiv cohort study ( shcs ) have played important roles in understanding the science of hiv , the aids epidemic and the effects of therapy [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] . in hiv natural history studies , hiv viral load and cd4 count are usually measured with wide intervals ( e.g. , every @xmath4 months approximately ) . therefore , for some event time of scientific interest , for example , the time between haart initiation and viral suppression , both the time origin ( haart initiation ) and the failure event ( viral suppression ) could be interval - censored .",
    "this situation is referred to as ` doubly interval - censored data ' in the literature . in fact , the statistical research on doubly interval - censored data was primarily motivated by scientific questions in hiv research , for example , modeling ` aids incubation time ' between hiv infection and the onset of aids [ @xcite ; @xcite ] . both nonparametric and semiparametric",
    "methods have been proposed for the estimation of the distribution function of the aids incubation time and its regression analysis . a comprehensive review on the analysis of doubly interval - censored data can be found in @xcite .",
    "the hiv epidemiology research study ( hers ) is a multi - site longitudinal cohort study of hiv natural history in women between @xmath5 and @xmath6 [ @xcite ] . at baseline between @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath7 the study enrolled @xmath8 hiv - seropositive women and @xmath9 hiv - seronegative women at high risk for hiv infection .",
    "participants were scheduled for approximately a @xmath4-year follow - up , where a variety of clinical , behavioral and sociologic outcomes were recorded approximately every @xmath4 months and measurements correspond to dates .",
    "the top part of table  [ hersbaseline ] gives selected baseline characteristics of the  1310 study participants ; more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "quantification of hiv rna viral load was performed using a branched - dna ( b - dna ) signal amplification assay with the detection limit at @xmath10 copies / ml and flow cytometry from whole blood was used to determine cd4 counts at each visit .",
    "all participants were haart - naive at baseline . during the study @xmath11",

    "the left panels indicate that the increasing trend for average cd4 count started later than the decreasing trend for viral load prevalence , but this phenomenon is probably not related to haart because the starting times for these trends are 12 years before the reported haart initiation time",
    ". it might be more useful to examine the change rates for average cd4 count and viral load prevalence to assess the effectiveness of haart .",
    "in fact , the right panels of figure  [ empinew ] show that the maximum decreasing rate for viral load prevalence occurred earlier ( around 4  months before reported haart initiation ) than the maximum increasing rate for average cd4 count ( around the reported haart initiation ) , which suggests the possible sequential relationship in post - haart hiv dynamics discussed in section  [ hivdynamicsintro ] .",
    "our objective is to develop a model for the joint distribution of the time from haart initiation to viral suppression , and the longitudinal cd4 counts relative to the viral suppression time following haart . as discussed in section  [ hersintro ] ,",
    "the time from haart initiation to viral suppression is doubly interval - censored .",
    "specifically , considering the reporting bias for haart initiation , we define the right endpoint of its corresponding censoring interval to be the first visit of reported haart use and the definition for the left endpoint is based on assumptions about the earliest possible time of haart initiation in the hers cohort .",

    "figure  [ selectedsub ] shows cd4 counts and corresponding censoring intervals of haart initiation and viral suppression following haart for selected hers women . as seen in the top left panel of figure  [ selectedsub ] , viral suppression after haart can be right - censored due to participant dropout , death and/or study end .",
    "similarly , participants could have incomplete cd4 count measurements for @xmath21 scheduled follow - up visits .",
    "however , because we focus on the subpopulation of haart users in the hers cohort , the missingness rate is relatively low compared to the whole hers population ; @xmath22 of the @xmath23 women in our analysis had at least @xmath24 visits .",
    "therefore , for the hers analysis in section  [ analysis2 ] , we assume that the missing data mechanism is missingness at random [ @xcite ] .",
    "given that the parameters for modeling the missing data mechanism and the outcomes are distinct and they have independent priors , the missing data are then ignorable when making posterior inference about the outcomes .",

    "the factorization in ( [ simple2 ] ) is based on the sequential relationship in post - haart dynamics .",
    "when haart regimen is successful in suppressing the virus , we are able to obtain @xmath19 , the time from haart initiation to viral suppression . as mentioned in section  [ hivdynamicsintro ] , there is a time ordering of virologic response and immunologic response to haart . because of this sequential relationship of virologic and immunologic response as well as the large between - individual heterogeneity in terms of the ability to suppress viral replication , the time to suppression and the durability of suppression , we believe that the mean cd4 count profiles from different individuals are more comparable after realigning measurement times by their individual viral suppression times following haart . therefore , we assume that the distribution of @xmath20 given @xmath29 depends on @xmath17 and @xmath19 only through a change in the time origin for the measurement times @xmath33 .",
    "this is similar to _ curve registration _ , a method originated in the functional data analysis literature [ @xcite ] for dealing with the situations where the rigid metric of physical time for real life systems is not directly relevant to internal dynamics .",
    "for example , the timing variation of salient features of individual puberty growth curves ( e.g. , time of puberty growth onset , time of peak velocity of puberty growth ) can result in the distortion of population growth curves [ @xcite ] .",
    "likewise , in our case , simply averaging individual cd4 count profiles along the time since enrollment ( @xmath16 ) or the time since haart initiation ( @xmath17 ) can attenuate the true population immunologic response profile following haart . because viral suppression is the main driving force of immune reconstitution [ @xcite ]",
    ", it is sensible to center the time scale at individual viral suppression times ( @xmath34 ) in order to describe the trends in immune reconstitution at the population level .",
    "however , as mentioned in section  [ hersintro ] , @xmath19 can be doubly interval - censored in hiv natural history studies , which presents a challenge in making inferences about the density in ( [ simple2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , for @xmath35 , we are faced with a situation similar to the missing or interval - censored covariate problem in generalized linear model literature [ @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "to accommodate this situation , we will extend the semiparametric bayesian approach in @xcite by modeling @xmath17 and @xmath19 simultaneously . note that here we model the observed @xmath17 only for taking into account the uncertainty in the time origin of @xmath19",
    "; we do not intend to make inference about the marginal distribution for haart initiation time , which requests the right - censored data from those participants who did not initiate haart during the study .",
    "this is different from the aids incubation time problem which motivated the research in doubly interval - censored data , where both hiv infection time and aids incubation time are of interest and hiv infection time can be right - censored [ @xcite ] .",
    "moreover , for the hers cohort , haart was not available before 1996 ; therefore , when haart initiation time is of scientific interest , it is not valid to use enrollment as the time origin because all hers women were not at risk for haart initiation between enrollment and 1996 .",
    "however , for the purpose of accommodating uncertainty for the time origin of @xmath19 , we can still use the observed censoring intervals for @xmath17 with enrollment as their time origin .    in the following sections , we present the details of the proposed joint model for the hers data .",
    "recall that all hers women were haart - naive at baseline . for those who initiated haart during follow - up ,",
    "let @xmath17 be a positive random variable representing the time from enrollment to haart initiation .",
    "participants were monitored only periodically , and at each follow - up visit they only reported whether they were on haart treatment since the last visit .",
    "hence , the true value for @xmath17 is only known to lie within an interval @xmath36 $ ] , where @xmath37 is the time of the visit preceding haart initiation and @xmath38 is the time of the first visit at which haart use is reported .",
    "let @xmath18 be the time from enrollment to viral suppression following haart initiation . by definition , @xmath26 .",
    "for those whose viral load has been suppressed , @xmath18 is observed to be in an interval @xmath39 $ ] , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are defined similarly as @xmath37 and @xmath38 . for those whose viral load was not suppressed during follow - up , @xmath42 , which corresponds to right censoring of @xmath18 .",

    "however , because the data are from a natural history study and the observed haart initiation times vary across individuals , the observed data for viral suppression time actually depend on the timing of haart initiation .",

    "alternatively , we could specify a uniform prior for the left boundary of haart initiation time between the left boundaries defined in ` narrow ' and ` wide ' intervals to reflect uncertainty about true haart initiation time .",
    "besides hcv coinfection , other potential determinants or modifiers of post - haart hiv dynamics include characteristics of the haart regimen , prior antiviral treatment history , stage of disease at the time of haart initiation ( viral load level ) , an intact immune system and other host characteristics , such as age , race , gender and genotype [ @xcite ] . for adjusting these possible factors , covariates can be added into the cd4 count model ( [ cd4model ] ) similarly as for the case of pretreatment cd4 level and baseline idu status .",
    "for doubly interval - censored data , one limitation of our bayesian semiparametric approach is that sample sizes could be small for reliable estimation when the unique values of the covariates are large .",
    "for example , there were only 4 hers women who were idu and hcv negative at baseline .",
    "therefore , we could not assign different dpp to all combinations of the covariate values when baseline idu is included as a covariate . in this scenario",
    ", a parametric approach can be developed to adjust for additional covariates .",
    "we believe that the proposed joint modeling approach is methodologically valuable .",
    "the proposed regression spline method is simple to implement , and naturally incorporates the typical features of longitudinal data such as between - individual and within - individual variations .",
    "the proposed model can be extended to characterize multiple processes in disease progression after treatment intervention , for example , the neurocognitive response to haart treatment after immune reconstitution is another process of interest apart from the virologic and immunologic response [ @xcite ] .",

    "<S> instead we use infrequent cohort data from long - term natural history studies and develop a model for characterizing post - haart hiv dynamics and their associations with hcv coinfection . specifically , we propose a joint model for doubly interval - censored data for the time between haart initiation and viral suppression , and the longitudinal cd4 count measurements relative to the viral suppression . </S>",
    "<S> inference is accomplished using a fully bayesian approach . doubly interval - censored data are modeled semiparametrically by dirichlet process priors and bayesian penalized splines are used for modeling population - level and individual - level mean cd4 count profiles . </S>",
