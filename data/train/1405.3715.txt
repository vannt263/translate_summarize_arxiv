    "the celebrated banados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz ) solution @xcite is the unique black hole of general relativity in three dimensions . for a number of years ,",
    "such a black hole solution was deemed impossible , and for good reason . in three - dimensional general relativity , there are no local gravitational degrees of freedom : curvature is algebraically fixed by the matter content , which implies that in a true vacuum the spacetime can only be flat . with a nonvanishing cosmological constant ,",
    "the field equations admit locally de sitter ( ds ) and anti - de sitter ( ads ) solutions , but still preclude solutions with nontrivial curvature .",
    "hence , one is led to believe that black hole solutions in three - dimensional einstein gravity are impossible .",
    "this argument is evaded by noting that it relies solely on local considerations .",
    "taking account of its global structure , a spacetime can contain a black hole in spite of being locally maximally symmetric .",
    "the btz solution is an example ; it is locally ads , but it is turned into a black hole spacetime by certain identifications of spacelike related events .",
    "ever since its discovery , the btz black hole has generated a considerable amount of attention , in large part due to its foreseen applications , particularly in addressing conceptual issues of quantum gravity that become more tractable in three dimensions .",
    "this unrelenting desire for a quantum theory of gravity has also inspired a number of interesting theoretical ideas .",
    "one of these is the suggestion that lorentz invariance may not be fundamental or exact , but is merely an emergent symmetry on sufficiently large distances or low energies .",
    "it has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that giving up lorentz invariance by introducing a preferred foliation and terms that contain higher - order spatial derivatives can lead to significantly improved uv behavior",
    ". the corresponding gravity theory is dubbed hoava gravity and we will review its basic properties in the next section .",
    "one needs to rethink the notion of a black hole in the presence of lorentz violations .",
    "theories that do not respect local lorentz symmetry may propagate superluminal excitations that can penetrate the usual horizon .",
    "they may even have instantaneous ( infinitely fast ) modes , as is the case for hoava gravity .",
    "however , studies of four - dimensional black holes in this theory @xcite have revealed the existence of a new type of horizon , called the universal horizon , which act as a causal boundary for all modes , irrespective of how fast they propagate .",
    "this allows one to generalize and preserve the ( or some ) notion of a black hole in the framework of lorentz - violating gravity theories ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the infrared limit of three - dimensional hoava gravity @xcite and our main goal is to seek a lorentz - violating version of the btz black hole , i.e.  a black hole solution with ads asymptotics .",
    "we show that such a spacetime exists only if one tunes the parameters of the theory .",
    "we find the most general family of solutions for this sector , assuming stationarity and circular symmetry , so generically our solution represents a rotating black hole .",
    "remarkably , some of our solutions represent black holes even for a positive or vanishing cosmological constant",
    ".    our motivation for seeking black hole solutions in the three - dimensional version of hoava gravity is twofold .",
    "first , we hope that they will be useful as a playground for studying quantum field theory and quantum gravity effects in black hole spacetimes , as has been the case for the btz black hole .",
    "second , we hope that we will gain some insight into the causal structure of black holes in the presence of lorentz violations  at least the aspects that do not depend on the dimensionality . it is worth stressing that our solutions are explicit and exact , unlike their four - dimensional counterparts . indeed ,",
    "the static , spherically symmetric solutions of ref .",
    "@xcite are numerical and those of ref .",
    "@xcite are numerical and valid in the small - coupling limit .",
    "explicit solutions in 4 dimensions are also known for specific , tuned choices of the parameters of the theory , but they are all static @xcite .",
    "the only rotating solutions currently known in four dimensions are not entirely explicit , and moreover , rely on the assumption of slow rotation @xcite .",
    "working in three dimensions allows us to avoid approximations or numerics .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a mostly - minus spacetime signature and set @xmath0 . in what follows",
    ", we will be referring to any solution for which the metric that couples minimally to matter fields has a killing horizon as a black hole .",
    "we choose to do so because , for the matter fields , which we assume to be relativistic , the killing horizon will be an event horizon .",
    "hence , the spacetime will be a black hole in the conventional ( gr ) sense .",
    "it should be clear , however , that this is actually an abuse of terminology in the context of hoava gravity , as perturbations that reside in the gravity sector can propagate infinitely fast , as mentioned earlier , so one could have chosen to reserve the term black hole for solutions that have a universal horizon .",
    "in its original formulation , hoava gravity is explicitly noncovariant and written in a preferred foliation . introducing the line element @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the lapse and the leaves of the foliation are constant-@xmath3 hypersurfaces with induced metric @xmath4 .",
    "the action of the theory in three dimensions then has the form @xcite @xmath5 ,   \\label{eqn : hlaction}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a coupling constant with dimensions of a length squared , @xmath7 @xmath8 is the determinant of the induced metric @xmath4 on the constant-@xmath3 hypersurfaces , ( @xmath9 ) are its extrinsic , mean and scalar curvatures , respectively , and @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 collectively denotes a set of all terms with 4 spatial derivatives that are invariant under diffeomorphisms that leave the foliation untouched .",
    "the presence of these higher - order terms is crucial for improved uv behavior .",
    "power - counting renormalizability requires terms of order @xmath12 to be present @xcite , where @xmath13 is the number of spatial dimensions .",
    "the full list of such terms for @xmath14 is given in ref .",
    "the version of hoava gravity we are considering here is the most general one , without any further symmetries or assumptions .",
    "it is the three - dimensional counterpart of the 4-dimension action presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for what follows we will focus on the infrared limit of the theory by neglecting the @xmath11 terms .",
    "this is expected to be a good approximation so long as the curvature remains small enough and the foliation is sufficiently smooth .    the low - energy part of the theory can be formulated in a covariant fashion , and it then becomes equivalent to a restricted version of einstein - aether theory @xcite , which is a theory that couples the metric to a timelike , unit - norm vector field , @xmath15 , called the aether .",
    "the correspondence with hoava gravity is realized by restricting the aether to be hypersurface - orthogonal , or more specifically , normal to the constant-@xmath3 hypersurfaces .",
    "hence , @xmath16 in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , einstein - aether theory with a cosmological constant @xmath17 is defined by the action @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a coupling constant with dimensions of a length squared , @xmath8 is the determinant of @xmath20 , @xmath17 is the cosmological constant , @xmath21 is the 3d ricci scalar , @xmath22 and @xmath23 by giving up part of the gauge freedom and choosing @xmath3 as the time coordinate , the aether takes the form @xmath24 and the action ( [ eqn : action ] ) reduces to that of hoava gravity in the infrared limit , with the correspondence of parameters @xmath25 where @xmath26 .    in the covariant formulation of the theory the preferred time @xmath3 becomes a scalar field that defines the preferred foliation at the level of the solution .",
    "irrespective of the formulation , the theory propagates a scalar degree of freedom in three dimensions and there is no spin-2 graviton @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that when the @xmath11 terms are ignored , the scalar mode will have a linear dispersion relation in flat space , whereas , in the full theory the dispersion relation will be rational and well approximated by @xmath27 for large momenta .",
    "so , excitations with sufficiently high momenta can reach arbitrarily high speeds .",
    "moreover , the theory has an instantaneous mode even in the low - energy limit ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion in four dimensions ) .",
    "both of these facts are particularly relevant for black hole spacetimes .",
    "high - energy modes will be able to penetrate surfaces that appear as usual horizons in the low - energy limit of the theory .",
    "more importantly , even within the framework of the low - energy approximation , the presence of instantaneous , infinite speed , modes means that information can be transmitted through these horizons .",
    "we find it convenient to work with the covariantized version of hoava gravity , equations of motioni.e .",
    "einstein - aether theory with the aether assumed to be hypersurface orthogonal _ before _ the variation .",
    "assuming stationarity and circular symmetry , the most general metric in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions is given by @xmath28 the aether field is also just a function of @xmath29 : @xmath30 .",
    "we shall refer to these as btz coordinates .    in three dimensions",
    ", @xmath15 is hypersurface - orthogonal if and only if @xmath31}=0 $ ] , which in btz coordinates is explicitly , @xmath32 .",
    "a trivial solution to this is @xmath33 . more generally , the hypersurface - orthogonality condition can be integrated to give @xmath34 , for some constant @xmath35 .",
    "this must hold throughout the spacetime . if @xmath36 , we see from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : khronon ] ) that @xmath3 will satisfy @xmath37 .",
    "this means that the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be only through the combination @xmath40 . in other words",
    ", we have @xmath41 , for some arbitrary function @xmath42 .",
    "but the coordinate @xmath39 runs along orbits of the spacelike axial killing vector of the spacetime . keeping all other coordinates fixed , there",
    "must then exist a constant @xmath43 so that @xmath39 and @xmath44 refer to the same spacetime event .",
    "this means that @xmath42 will either be multivalued on each spacetime event , or it will have to be periodic in both @xmath39 and @xmath38 .",
    "none of these options seem to be acceptable for a coordinate that is supposed to act as the preferred time of a global foliation .",
    "hence , we shall only focus on aether configurations for which @xmath45 or @xmath33 .",
    "with @xmath33 , the unit norm constraint allows us to parametrize the aether as @xmath46 where we denote @xmath47 by the function @xmath48 from now on . with no loss of generality , we shall choose the positive ( + ) branch for @xmath49 .",

    "( [ eqn : action ] ) , discarding boundary terms , and using the hoava parameters @xmath50 , we arrive at the reduced action @xmath51 where    @xmath52    requiring stationarity of the reduced action , @xmath53 , then supplies our equations of motion .",
    "these are the euler - lagrange ( el ) equations with respect to the functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "results obtained with the reduced action approach should always be treated and interpreted with some caution .",
    "critical points with respect to symmetric variations of the action need not be stationary points with respect to general variations .",
    "therefore , solutions to equations of motion that arise from symmetry - reduced actions need not satisfy the full field equations @xcite .",
    "however , _ any _ symmetric solution to the full field equation ought to be a critical point with respect to symmetric variations .",
    "the equations of motion from symmetric variations then constitute _ necessary _ conditions for any solution to the full field equations .",
    "if one succeeds in integrating them ( or a subset of them ) , one can simply check if the solutions indeed satisfy the full field equations @xcite .",
    "this is the strategy we adopt here .",
    "from eq . ( [ eqn : reducedl ] ) , the el equation with respect to @xmath56 is @xmath57 this can be integrated to give @xmath58 for integration constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    with the coordinate transformation @xmath61 , we can set @xmath62 without loss of generality . substituting @xmath56 into each of three remaining el equations ,",
    "we are left with a coupled nonlinear system in the remaining unknowns @xmath63 , which are too lengthy to be usefully displayed here . in the remainder , we refer to the el equation corresponding to @xmath64 as the @xmath64 equation , and likewise for the others .",
    "a natural starting point is to look for maximally symmetric solutions in three - dimensional hoava gravity .",
    "after all , the ( btz ) black hole of three - dimensional general relativity belongs to this class of spacetimes ( i.e. , ads ) , and we shall search for solutions that approach btz in the appropriate limit",
    ". we shall discover in this section that any asymptotically ads analogue in hoava gravity can only exist in the @xmath65 sector of the theory ( see also ref .",

    "since @xmath73 , these now form a coupled system of three nonlinear differential equations for @xmath81 . for a solution to exist , these equations clearly must not all be independent of each other .    by systematically eliminating terms proportional to @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the el equations , they can be combined to give the equation @xmath84 if @xmath85 , then we have @xmath86 , where @xmath60 and @xmath13 are arbitrary integration constants . using eq .",

    "( [ eqn : sol1 ] ) , we conclude that the leading - order terms of the el equations can not simultaneously vanish .",
    "this means that for @xmath370 , in @xmath96 , ads asymptotics for the metric are inadmissible .      in this case , enforcing that the locs of the @xmath55 , @xmath67 , and @xmath64 equations vanish ( respectively ) , we have @xmath388    the first of these equations demands that @xmath389 .",
