    "the galaxy pair ngc 4038/39 ( arp 244 ) is an interacting system in an early stage of merging at a distance of about 21 mpc from our own galaxy . on long - exposed images in the optical ( e.g. arp 1966 )",
    "the interaction is clearly visible because of the tails ( `` antennae '' ) emerging from two uniformly luminous , partly overlapping ovals and because of the dwarf galaxy that appears to have formed at the tip of the southern tail through the interaction ( zwicky 1956 , schweizer 1978 , mirabel , dottori , & lutz 1992 ) .",
    "the tails contain about 70  % of the total amount of in the system ( van der hulst 1979 ) .",
    "short - exposed images ( laustsen , madsen , & west 1987 ) reveal hints of the interaction on somewhat smaller scales ; the distorted arrangement of h@xmath11 knots and the velocity distribution of the individual knots lead rubin  ( 1970 ) to conclude there is an interaction of two rotating galaxies .",
    "computer simulations carried out in the classical paper of toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) and later by barnes ( 1988 ) can account for the present morphological appearance of the system quite well by assuming an interaction of two rotating spiral galaxies .",
    "spectra of the nuclei of both galaxies taken in the optical range do not look like pure starburst spectra but consist of a composition of early - type stars and late giants ( keel  1985 ) .",
    "the detection of bright near - infrared peaks at the nuclei lead bushouse & werner ( 1990 ) to the same result .",
    "their images of the antennae in j- and r - band and in h@xmath11 show also the same pattern of bright knots in the surroundings of ngc 4038 and in the bridge connecting both galaxies .",
    "the antennae system as a whole shows a relatively low star forming efficiency according to the ratio @xmath12 measured by young  ( 1986 ) ; it is only a factor of 3 higher than in the milky way .",
    "the ratio determined by sanders & mirabel ( 1985 ) is almost twice as high .",
    "however , they observed a smaller region in co and therefore probably underestimated the molecular mass .",
    "comparison of the antennae with the sample of interacting and isolated galaxies of young  ( 1986 ) shows ngc 4038/39 to have characteristics more like isolated galaxies .",
    "measurements in the radio continuum at 1.5  ghz and 4.9  ghz of ngc  4038/39 ( hummel & van der hulst 1986 ) reveal a number of discrete knots which coincide in general with h@xmath11 knots , and an underlying diffuse component .",
    "this diffuse component has a steep spectral index on average which indicates non - thermal emission , and the peak of the diffuse radio emission is at the dust patch near the overlapping region .",
    "the discrete radio knots account for roughly 35  % of the total radio emission and have a spectral index of @xmath13 on average , probably due to a thermal contribution ( hummel & van der hulst 1986 ) .",
    "interferometric observations of the antennae in co ( @xmath14 ) by stanford  ( 1990 ) show three main concentrations of co emission .",
    "two are associated with the nuclei and the third with the interaction zone .",
    "the overlap region is the strongest co source and contains @xmath15 of gas , roughly as much h@xmath16 as both nuclei together .",
    "based on 10@xmath17 m and h@xmath11 data , the authors have calculated a star forming rate of @xmath18  yr@xmath19 , and consequently the life time of the molecular gas is @xmath20  yr .",
    "single dish observations in co were made at the interaction zone and both nuclei of the antennae by aalto  ( 1995 ) .",
    "the ratio of the emission lines of @xmath21co and @xmath22co measured in the nuclei and the overlapping region of the antennae is similar to that found in the central regions of `` normal '' starburst galaxies ( aalto  1995 ) .",
    "an excellent tracer of star formation activity in galaxies is the strong [ ] 158  @xmath17 m @xmath23p@xmath24p@xmath25 fine structure line which arises mainly from photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) created by far - ultraviolet photons from hot young stars impinging on nearby dense interstellar clouds ( crawford  1985 , stacey  1991 ) . in combination with co and fir observations , the [ ] emission can be used with pdr models ( tielens & hollenbach 1985 , wolfire , hollenbach , &",
    "tielens 1989 , wolfire , tielens , & hollenbach 1990 ) to derive densities and far - uv intensities and estimates of the star formation activity .",
    "extragalactic surveys of [ ] emission ( crawford  1985 , stacey 1991 ) concentrated mainly on nuclei while more recent observations have imaged individual galaxies to study the distribution of [ ] emission on large scales .",
    "[ ] images of m83 ( geis  1998 ) and ngc  6946 ( madden 1993 ) demonstrate that the emission is extended at least over the full optical extent and often follows the distribution of the fir and co within the disk of the galaxies . in the case of ngc  6946",
    "[ ] emission beyond the optical extent of the galaxy has been found .",
    "this [ ] emission has been attributed to diffuse gas and not to pdrs .",
    "therefore we also estimate the possible contribution of [ ] emission from neutral atomic gas and from ionized gas in ngc  4038/39 . because of its relative proximity",
    ", ngc  4038/39 is a unique source for carrying out spatially resolved measurements of the [ ] line in an interacting system .",
    "we present the results of our imaging spectroscopy study of the [ ] line in ngc  4038/39 and compare them with observations obtained with iso .",
    "the observations of the antennae in the [ ] @xmath23p@xmath24p@xmath25 fine structure line at 157.7409  have been carried out during four individual flights in 1992 with the kuiper airborne observatory ( kao ) from christchurch , new zealand , using the mpe / ucb far - infrared imaging fabry - perot interferometer ( fifi ; poglitsch  1991 , stacey  1992 ) . at 158  the fwhm of the beam",
    "is about 55 .",
    "the detector array consists of 5  @xmath26  5 pixels of size 40  @xmath26  40  per pixel on the sky .",
    "we observed three array positions to cover an area of 300  @xmath26  300  including both galaxies and the interaction zone and to fully sample an area of 150  @xmath26  150  around the interaction zone . due to the large velocity dispersion in one array setting , as determined from the emission of the h@xmath11 knots ( rubin , ford , & dodorico 1970 ) and from the co emission ( stanford  1990 ) , we chose a spectral resolution of 144  km  s@xmath19 ( fwhm ) and a scan width of 380  km  s@xmath19 .",
    "the scan center was set at 1600  km  s@xmath19 . the wavelength calibration was implemented by means of the h@xmath16s absorption line at 157.7726  .",
    "flat fielding of the detector was carried out with two internal black bodies .",
    "the secondary mirror of the telescope was chopped approximately 4 in roughly the east - west direction , and the telescope was nodded to compensate for the beam offset . for absolute intensity calibration we observed jupiter at 158  and assumed a temperature of 128 k at this wavelength ( hildebrand  1985 ) , an equatorial diameter of 43.22 , and a pole diameter of 40.42  ( the astronomical almanac 1992 ) for jupiter .",
    "the accuracy of the intensity calibration is estimated to be about 30  % and the absolute pointing positions are uncertain by about 15 .",
    "the fabry - perot interferometers in fifi are adjusted to the appropriate velocity range and spectral resolution for every object .",
    "further the fabry - perot interferometers are put to a park position when the instrument is not in use .",
    "therefore the fabry - perot interferometers are adjusted newly for every observing flight and for every object and there may occure slight shifts ( @xmath27 a few km / s ) of the velocity center of the spectral scans between individual observations . to combine the different pointings of the observation of the antennae obtained in different observing flights we used the velocity range contained in all observations ( 1420  1740  km  s@xmath19 ) .    to combine the different array positions , to account for the statistical errors in the data , and to regrid the data points on a regular grid",
    ", we constructed a program using the method of maximum entropy .",
    "the program follows mainly the procedure of gull & daniel ( 1978 ) as described in skilling & bryan ( 1984 ) .",
    "it determines the maximum entropy of an image consisting of model data points on a pre - set regular grid on condition that the model data , after convolving with the beam , fits the observed data according to a chi - square fit . for large n , the program stops if @xmath28 is approximately equal to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of observed data points ( skilling & bryan 1984 ) .",
    "this criterion corresponds to a 99  % confidence level for the chi - square fit .",
    "the observed data points were deconvolved and regridded with this program onto a 10  regular grid and smoothed with a 55  gaussian beam .    taking the peculiar velocity structure of the antennae (",
    "as seen , for example , in h@xmath11 ( amram  1992 ) ) into account and using spectral separation we can distinguish different components of the system that are not spatially resolved .",
    "therefore we subdivided the total velocity range into two velocity ranges ( @xmath31 1420  1554  km  s@xmath19 and @xmath31 1550  1740  km  s@xmath19 ) in order to distinguish between the interaction zone ( at roughly @xmath31 1450  1590  km  s@xmath19 ) and the nuclei ( at @xmath31 1600  km  s@xmath19 and @xmath31 1630  km  s@xmath19 for ngc 4039 ( the southern galaxy ) and ngc 4038 ( the northern galaxy ) , respectively ) ( amram  1992 , rubin  1970 , stanford  1990 ) .",
    "the cut in the velocity range is somewhat arbitrary since on the one hand the velocity gradient between the interaction zone and ngc 4039 is large , and on the other hand no clear spatial transition in the velocity occurs between ngc 4038 and the interaction zone .    to obtain the [ ] integrated intensity maps in different",
    "velocity ranges we subdivided the raw data into two adjacent velocity bins and then applied the maximum entropy program for each velocity range separately . since the upper and lower velocity ranges are derived only from part of the spectrum they have slighty different @xmath32 values .",
    "the @xmath32 values for the total , the upper , and the lower velocity ranges are @xmath33  , @xmath34  , and @xmath35  , respectively .",
    "we superimposed maps of the total [ ]  158  line emission and the emission in the two seperate velocity ranges on an optical image ( laustsen , madsen , & west 1987 ) of the antennae ( fig.1a    c ) . for a better comparison we used the same contour levels in each velocity range .",
    "the contour levels are in steps of 1 @xmath32 deduced from the data of the total velocity range .",
    "c@xmath36 is seen over the full extent of the merging system ( fig.1a ) . from the line intensity integrated over the total velocity range one can infer the origin of the bulk of the [ ] emission . in all of the three images the peak of the [ ] emission",
    "is situated at the interaction zone with slight differences in the location of the [ ] peak in each velocity range .",
    "the distribution of the [ ] emission in the total velocity range ( fig.1a ) and the upper velocity range ( corresponding to the nuclei ) ( fig.1b ) are very similar and agree well with the overall shape of the galaxy pair as seen in short - exposed optical images , if we take the different beam sizes into account .",
    "the emission is elongated along the bridge between the two galaxies , including the interaction zone , ngc  4039 , and extends even further south .",
    "it is also extended in the north - west showing the western loop of [ ] regions around ngc  4038 . however , for the upper velocity range one would have expected a stronger concentration of the [ ] emission at the nuclei and less strong at the interaction zone .",
    "since the cut between the velocity ranges was made at 1550  km  s@xmath19 and the velocity range of the gas in the interaction zone is 14501590  km  s@xmath19 ( amram  1992 ; rubin , ford , & dodorico 1970 ; stanford  1990 ) it may be possible that most of the [ ] emission is coming from gas with velocities higher than 1550  km  s@xmath19 .",
    "this would also explain the relatively weak [ ] emission in the lower velocity range .",
    "the [ ] emission in the lower velocity range is less extended than in the other velocity ranges and more concentrated toward the interaction zone as expected from that velocity .",
    "the [ ] peak coincides also with the peak of the co emission of the antennae ( stanford  1990 ) ( fig.2 ) . within the interaction zone",
    "the southern clump is the strongest co emitting region .",
    "the results of the measurement of the [ ]  158  emission in the different velocity ranges for different positions are given in table 1 .",
    "the total [ ] luminosity from the region enclosed by the first contour line in fig.1a is @xmath0 } = 3.7 \\times 10^{8 } l_{\\sun}$ ] for the total velocity range . in comparison with the [ ] iso - lws observations of the antennae ( fischer  1996 )",
    ", we determined a line flux of @xmath37  w  @xmath38 within the area of the larger iso beam .",
    "this is about 2.4 times higher than the line flux measured with iso .",
    "by weighting the data measured with fifi within the iso beam with a gaussion of @xmath39 fwhm we obtain a line flux of @xmath40  w  @xmath38 which agrees within the statistical errors and the calibration errors with the value measured with iso . a possible explanation for this discrepancy would be if the [ ] emission originates from small clumped regions spread over the interaction zone .",
    "thus the emission of clumps at the edge of the iso beam are only accounted for with the weight of the beam .",
    "the [ ]  158  fine structure line may arise from at least three components of the interstellar medium : photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , atomic gas clouds , and diffuse regions .",
    "in starburst galaxies and star forming regions the contribution of the [ ] fine structure line from pdrs is much stronger than from other components of the interstellar medium which can therefore be neglected .",
    "however , it is important to investigate the origin of the [ ] emission from the ngc 4038/39 system .",
    "we follow a procedure originally presented in madden  ( 1993 ) , to investigate the various origins of [ ] emission .      no fir continuum map with a resolution comparable to the [ ] data exists for the antennae .",
    "the only fir continuum data available to compare with the [ ] emission is from iras observations .",
    "according to the formula given in lonsdale  ( 1985 ) @xmath41 we calculated the fir luminosity from the iras flux densities at 60  @xmath42 m and 100  @xmath42 m for the entire antennae system . with @xmath43  jy and @xmath44  jy ( surace  1993 ) , the fir luminosity for the total system is @xmath45 , with an assumed distance of 21  mpc .",
    "consequently the total [ ] luminosity is about 1% of the fir luminosity . an attempt to obtain sufficient spatial resolution to resolve the nuclei from the iras data using hires and addscan was unsuccessful ( surace   1993 ) .",
    "therefore , to get an estimate of the fir continuum separately for the interaction zone and the nuclei we use the fir / radio correlation . however , in general the fir / radio correlation is only valid for late - type galaxies . despite this",
    "we use this correlation because the optical spectra of the nuclei indicate a mixture of regions with an old population and the interaction zone shows also a strong radio continuum ( hummel & van der hulst 1986 ) in combination with the young star forming region .",
    "the isocam observations of the 6.7 and 15  continuum reveal very clumpy emission dominated by bright knots , and from the good correlation of the 15  continuum intensity with the [ ] / [ ] ratio , vigroux  ( 1996 ) deduce that the 15  continuum is due to thermal emission from hot dust heated by the absorption of the ionizing photons emitted by young stars . on the kpc scale of our beam , the extension of the fir continuum originating from thermal emission from moderately warm dust , and",
    "the 15   continuum created from these young star forming regions may be similar .",
    "therefore , a strong but very confined , recent starburst as it is seen at the interaction zone with isocam probably does not distort the fir / radio correlation very much on our kpc scale .    for the whole antennae the fir luminosity and the total flux density of the 20  cm radio continuum , @xmath46  mjy ( hummel & van der hulst 1986 ) , fulfil the fir / radio correlation : @xmath47 with @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( xu  1994 ) . under the assumption that the fir / radio correlation is also valid at the scale of our beam size we estimate the fir continuum at the interaction zone and the nuclei by distributing the fir continuum the same way as the low spatial resolution 20  cm radio continuum ( hummel & van der hulst 1986 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : c ii20 ] ) . for",
    "that we convolved the 20  cm map to a spatial resolution of 55and scaled it such that the total flux in the map matches the iras observation .",
    "we obtain a fir continuum luminosity within our beam of @xmath51 at the [ ] peak , @xmath52 at ngc  4038 , and @xmath53 at ngc  4039 .      for the treatment of pdrs we used the model described by stacey   ( 1991 , and references therein ) .",
    "photodissociation regions are the interfaces between regions and molecular clouds where photons with energies less than 13.6  ev escape from the regions , dissociate molecules and ionize elements with dissociation or ionization energies lower than the lyman limit ( 13.6  ev ) .",
    "carbon is the most abundant element with an ionization energy ( 11.3  ev ) less than the 13.6  ev .",
    "ionized carbon is then excited by collisions with electrons and/or atomic and molecular hydrogen .",
    "the gas in this region is heated mainly by photoelectric emission from grains illuminated by far - uv radiation .",
    "however , most of the far - uv flux which is absorbed by grains is converted into fir radiation .",
    "assuming high temperature ( @xmath54  k ) , high density ( @xmath55 ) , optically thin [ ] emission , and a beam filling factor of unity we can estimate a lower limit of the c@xmath36 column density and hydrogen mass ( crawford  1985 ) . using a solar fractional carbon abundance of [ c]/[h ]  @xmath56 and assuming that all the carbon is in form of c@xmath36 we derive a lower limit of the hydrogen column density .",
    "the result of this estimate is given in table 2 .",
    "for each of the positions we took the integrated [ ] intensity in the total velocity range . a comparison of the estimated masses of the pdrs with the molecular masses given by stanford  ( 1990 ) show that the ratio of the mass of the pdr to the molecular mass is 6% for the whole antennae , 6% for the interaction zone , 4% for ngc  4038 , and 15% for ngc  4039 .",
    "the high ratio for ngc  4039 is probably due to the fact that the beam of the [ ] observation also includes part of the interaction zone . except for the high ratio in ngc  4039 the pdr to molecular gas mass ratio lies within the expected range of 110% ( stacey  1991 ) .    to compare the [ ] integrated intensity with the co ( @xmath57 ) intensity we use the co - data from aalto  ( 1995 ) since their observations were made with a single dish and with a similar beamsize , 43  fwhm .",
    "they observed three different positions : the interaction zone , ngc 4039 , and ngc 4038 .",
    "for the comparison , we use the [ ] emission in the total velocity range since the measurement of aalto  ( 1995 ) was also obtained in a wide velocity range ( @xmath58  km  s@xmath19 ) .    in figure 4",
    ", we plotted @xmath59 } = i_{\\rm [ c ii ] } /   \\chi_{\\rm fir}$ ] versus @xmath60 .",
    "the advantage of taking these ratios is that they allow one to determine the gas density , @xmath61 , and uv - field , @xmath62 , independently of the beam filling factor if it is assumed that the [ ] , the co , and the fir emission arise from the same regions .",
    "the theoretically calculated ratios for a set of constant densities @xmath61 ( solid lines ) and a set of constant uv intensities @xmath62 ( 6  ev @xmath6313.6  ev ) ( thick dashed lines ) are also shown in figure  [ fig : pdr ] ( wolfire , hollenbach , & tielens ( 1989 ) , stacey  1991 ) .",
    "the observations for the interaction zone ( filled triangle ) , for ngc  4039 ( filled square ) and for ngc  4038 ( filled circle ) are marked in the plot .",
    "the grey diagonal bars indicate the standard deviation of the fir luminosity as derived from the linear regression line of the fir / radio correlation in fig.1 of xu  ( 1994 ) .",
    "we use this scatter as an estimate for the error in distributing the total iras flux over the mapped area according to the distribution of the 20  cm radio continuum map ( see section 4.2.4 ) .",
    "the results for the density and the uv - intensity are given in table 3 .",
    "two possible solutions for @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be found : a low density ( l ) and a high density ( h ) solution . in both cases",
    "the uv - intensity is modest . under the condition that @xmath64 ( low density solution ) or @xmath65 @xmath66 ( high density solution ) a low @xmath67 } / i_{\\rm co}$ ] ratio is predicted ( wolfire , hollenbach , & tielens 1989 ) . in the low @xmath62 regime",
    "the [ ] emission is reduced by low temperatures @xmath68 k , and in the low @xmath69 regime by the co self - shielding which brings the [ ] /co transition closer to the surface and therefore lowers the c@xmath36 column density . at the interaction zone a @xmath21co(2 - 1 ) / @xmath21co(1 - 0 )",
    "line ratio of 1.2 has been observed and can be interpreted as arising from gas with @xmath70  @xmath3 ( aalto  1995 , and fig .  3 therein ) , supporting the high density solution in this region . for the nuclei",
    "this ratio has not been observed .",
    "the densities we derive for the high density solution are somewhat higher than what wolfire , tielens , & hollenbach ( 1990 ) deduced for orion , m82 and the inner region of the galactic center from the pdr model .",
    "however , we find a much lower fuv flux .",
    "the fuv flux for the high density solution is also at the lower limit of the range of the fuv flux derived from the iso - lws observations ( fischer   1996 ) .",
    "fischer  ( 1996 ) , however , determined a density for the pdrs which is an order of magnitude smaller than what we derived for the individual positions .",
    "we derived the beam filling factor for the single - component model ( averaged over both components ) . to estimate the beam filling factor we used the ratio of the derived @xmath71 to the modelled @xmath62 ( table 3 ) .",
    "if we assume that the beam filling factor is unity and that most of the stellar photons are absorbed by dust grains , then @xmath72 for b stars and @xmath73 for o stars . including the beam filling factor , @xmath74 , we get therefore @xmath75 . for the individual galaxies ngc 4038 and ngc 4039 where a large fraction of late type stars exists ( bushouse & werner 1990 , keel 1985 ) the observed @xmath71 may not only be created by uv radiation , but also from visible light . thus taking the beam filling factor as @xmath76 gives an upper limit .",
    "but there is still the uncertainty from the estimate of the fir continuum . from the beam filling factors we estimate source sizes of @xmath27 24  for the interaction zone which is about the total size of the overlap region observed in co ( stanford  1990 ) , and @xmath27 1921  for the nuclei which is about twice the size estimated from radio emission ( hummel & van der hulst 1986 ) and from co observations ( stanford  1990 ) .    from the extinction corrected hydrogen recombination lines at the interaction zone observed with iso ( kunze  1996 ) we can also deduce the uv intensity originating in this region . an equivalent single star effective temperature of the stellar ionizing radiation field of 44000  k has been derived from the [ ]  15.6  @xmath17 m  /  [ ]  12.8@xmath77 m line ratio ( kunze  1996 ) .",
    "this effective temperature corresponds to an o5 main sequence star .",
    "therefore we use the properties of such a star to derive the lyman continuum emission .",
    "about 60  % of the total stellar luminosity is emitted in the lyman continuum with an average photon energy of 18  ev ( panagia 1973 ) .",
    "the rest is mainly emitted as far - uv radiation . assuming case b recombination ( osterbrock 1989 ) we get for the relation between the extinction corrected br@xmath11 line intensity ( kunze   1996 ) and the uv intensity @xmath78\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the relative intensity of br@xmath11 to h@xmath80 , @xmath81 is the total recombination coefficient , and @xmath82 the effective recombination coefficient of h@xmath80 given from hummer & storey ( 1987 ) . from this expression",
    "we derive a uv intensity of @xmath83 ( for standard conditions : @xmath84  k , @xmath85  @xmath3 ) and thus a far - uv intensity of @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) which is comparable to the far - uv we obtained from the @xmath88 } - y_{\\rm co}$ ] plot for the interaction zone .",
    "we have done this estimate only for the interaction zone since iso has only measured the hydrogen lines in the interaction zone .      in the neutral interstellar medium ionized carbon",
    "is excited by collisions with electrons and atomic hydrogen .",

    "we assume the carbon abundance to be solar and that all the carbon is in the form of c@xmath36 ( @xmath96 ) .",

    "the beam filling factor was assumed to be 1 .",
    "the critical density for collisions with atomic hydrogen , @xmath99 , is deduced from the cooling function for collisional excitation of [ ] by atomic hydrogen ( launay & roueff 1977 ) , and that for collisions with electrons , @xmath100 , is deduced from collision strengths for [ ] collisions with electrons ( blum & pradhan 1992 ) , and fitted as functions of temperature .",

    "integrated intensity is also more than one order of magnitude smaller than the observed integrated intensity in the nuclei , where the column density should be smaller ( van der hulst 1979 ) , a contribution of [ ] emission from the wnm to the observed integrated intensity is negligible .    carrying out the same calculations for cold neutral medium characterized by @xmath107",

    "200  @xmath3 , ionization fraction of @xmath109 ( estimated for the galaxy , kulkarni & heiles 1987 , 1988 ) and again using the peak column density of @xmath110  @xmath38 ( van der hulst 1979 ) we get a maximum integrated intensity of @xmath67 }   \\approx 2.7 \\times 10^{-5}$ ]  ( at @xmath111  k , @xmath112  @xmath3 ) and a minimum integrated intensity of @xmath67 }   \\approx 3.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ ]  ( at @xmath113  k , @xmath114",
    "@xmath3 ) for collisions with electrons and atomic hydrogen , where the contribution of collisions with electrons can almost be neglected .",
    "therefore , at standard conditions ( @xmath115  k , @xmath116  @xmath3 ) the [ ] emission from cnm is a factor of 9 smaller than the total [ ] radiation at the interaction zone , but may contribute as much as @xmath117 of the total [ ] emission .",
    "for the nuclei we estimate a similar contribution from cnm to the [ ] radiation using a column density of @xmath118 @xmath38 , from fig .  5 of van der hulst ( 1979 ) at the positions of the nuclei .",
    "another possibility for the origin of the [ ] emission is from ionized gas , either extended low density warm ionized medium ( eldwim ) or `` standard '' regions .",
    "although the shape of the contour plot of the [ ] fine structure line ( of total velocity range ) shows some similarities to the low resolution 20  cm radio continuum ( hummel & van der hulst 1986 ) ( fig.3 ) , this extended radio continuum has a relatively steep radio spectrum ( @xmath119 ) hence it is almost completely non - thermal and does not trace extended ionized regions .",
    "the radio spectrum is steepest in the eastern part of the system , and regions devoid of strong optical emission , e.g. at the location of the dust patch in between the galaxy nuclei , show steeper spectra than regions that are bright in h@xmath11 and blue light .",
    "therefore , the eldwim probably plays only a minor role and [ ] emission from this medium may be neglected .",
    "however , the radio knots 113 seen in the 4.9  ghz high resolution map of hummel & van der hulst ( 1986 ) ( fig .",
    "5 ) have a sizeable thermal component . to estimate the [ ] intensity expected to arise from the thermal emission of the knots within our beam we weight them relative to their distance from the center of the beam .",
    "we calculated the emission measure ( spitzer 1978 ) to be @xmath120  @xmath121pc for the interaction zone and @xmath122  @xmath121pc and @xmath123  @xmath121pc for ngc  4038 and ngc  4039 , respectively . making the crude approximation that all of the carbon in the region is in form of c@xmath36 and that all of the observed @xmath124 results in the excitation of [ ] , the expected [ ] integrated intensity is @xmath89 } = \\frac{h \\nu a}{4 \\pi n_{\\rm crit } } \\left [   \\frac{\\frac{g_{u}}{g_{l}}}{1 + \\left ( 1 + \\frac{g_{u}}{g_{l } } \\right )   \\frac{n_{\\rm e}}{n_{\\rm crit } } } \\right ] x_{\\rm c^{+ } } em \\qquad .\\ ] ] here @xmath125 is the ratio of the statistical weights in the upper and lower level and @xmath126 @xmath3 is the critical density of c@xmath36 for collisions with electrons at @xmath127 k ( blum & pradhan 1992 ) .",
    "assuming an electron density of @xmath128 @xmath3 as estimated from the extinction corrected ratio of the [ ] 18.71@xmath17m/33.48@xmath17 m fine structure line ( kunze  1996 ) the expected [ ] intensity is @xmath129  at the interaction zone , which is about a factor 20 smaller than the observed [ ] intensity in the lower velocity range .",

    "this is about a factor 17 lower for ngc 4038 and a factor 8 lower for ngc 4039 than the observed [ ] intensities at the upper velocity range .",
    "however , most of the carbon in regions is probably in the form of c@xmath132 rather than c@xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the [ ] emission expected from regions is even lower and should be only a minor fraction of the observed [ ] radiation .",
    "as shown in the previous section a possible contribution of [ ] emission from the wnm , eldwim and regions to the total observed [ ] emission is small . for high temperatures and high densities a contribution of [ ] emission from cnm may become important",
    "however , since at standard conditions of the cnm a contribution of [ ] emission to the observed [ ] emission is also small we will only consider pdrs as the origin of the [ ] emission in the following discussion .",
    "stacey  ( 1991 ) demonstrated the utility of the [ ] /co(1 - 0 ) ratio to distinguish between starburst activity in galaxies and more quiesent regions .",
    "they find [ ] /co @xmath133 ( 4000 ) for starburst nuclei and galactic starforming regions while the more quiesent regions show a ratio of @xmath134 ( 1300 ) .",
    "we find [ ] /co @xmath135 ( 1650 ) toward the [ ] peak ( overlap region ) and 1650 to 1800 ( 1150 to 1250)toward the nuclei , implying there is no strong starburst activity taking place , given the resolution of our data",
    ". these ratios are more consistent with quiescent spiral galaxies , e.g. ngc  891 and ngc  3628 ( stacey  1991 ) .",
    "however , observations with iso ( kunze  1996 ; fischer  1996 ; vigroux  1996 ) , co observations ( stanford  1990 ; aalto  1995 ) , and observations of the radio continuum ( hummel & van der hulst 1986 ) indicate ongoing strong star formation activity in the interaction zone . a comparison of the co flux of the interferometric observation ( scaled to the size and the position of the single dish observation ) of stanford  ( 1990 ) ( fig .",
    "2 ) with the single dish observation of aalto  ( 1995 ) show a factor of about 4 more co flux in the single dish observation ( @xmath136 ) for the interaction zone and ngc  4039 and a factor 3 for ngc  4038 . if we assume that @xmath137 of the single dish co flux at the interaction zone arises from a confined starburst region , @xmath138 , and use a ratio of @xmath139}^{\\rm sb}/f_{\\rm co}^{\\rm sb } = 6000 $ ] ( the mean ratio observed for starburst galaxies , stacey  1991 ) for this region we find a ratio of @xmath140}^{\\rm sb } -   f_{\\rm [ c ii]}^{o})/(f_{\\rm co}^{\\rm sb } - f_{\\rm co}^{o } ) \\approx 1200 $ ] for an underlying component . for @xmath139}^{o}/f_{\\rm co}^{o}$ ] we used the observed ratio of 2350 .",
    "this estimate suggests that the [ ] emission toward the interaction zone can also be explained by a two - component model with a confined starburst region and a quiescent surrounding molecular cloud system . making the same estimate for ngc  4039 we get a [ ] to co ratio of 400 for an underlying component . to make the same estimate for ngc  4038 one has to assume a lower [ ] to co integrated intensity ratio for the confined starburst region since otherwise",
    "the ratio of the underlying component becomes negative .",
    "the lowest value for the [ ] to co ratio in stacey  ( 1991 ) is 340 for the sgra + 20  km  s@xmath19 cloud .",
    "if we assume a lower limit for the [ ] to co ratio for the underlying component of 300 we find a maximum [ ] to co ratio for a confined starburst region of 4400 for ngc  4038 using the observed ratio of @xmath139}^{o}/f_{\\rm co}^{o } = 1650 $ ] . from this estimate",
    "we find that an enhanced star forming activity in ngc  4039 and a moderate activity in ngc  4038 could be explained by the data",
    ". this interpretation would be consistent with the results of the mid - infrared observations of ngc 4038/39 with isocam ( vigroux  1996 ) .",
    "they show that the most active star formation in the antennae system occurs in the overlap region , and within that region in a confined area ( knot 2 in fig . 5 ; knot a in fig . 1 in vigroux  1996 ) coinciding with the southern clump of the co emission in stanford  ( 1990 ) .",
    "the iso sws observations of the interaction zone can also be described by a young ( @xmath141  yr ) starburst with an imf extending up to 100  m@xmath142 ( kunze  1996 ) .",
    "the interpretation that the [ ] emission arises from confined small star forming regions is also consistent with the detection of br@xmath143 knots in the interaction zone ( fischer  1996 ) .",
    "the case that most of the [ ] emission comes from confined star forming regions supports the pdr solution with a small beam filling factor and therefore with high density .",
    "the pdr solution with high density is also supported by the iso observations of fischer  ( 1996 ) .",
    "although we see moderate [ ] emission from the regions in the western loop around ngc  4038 , in the absence of co data for that region and taking our beam size into account we can not draw a conclusion about the star forming activity there .",
    "we present a map of ngc 4038/39 in the [ ] 158  fine structure line . [ ]",
    "emission is detected over the optical extent of the system of galaxies and peaks at the interaction zone .",
    "the total luminosity of the [ ] line is @xmath144 which is about 1% of the fir luminosity of the antennae .",
    "only a negligible fraction of the observed [ ] emission can originate in the wnm , if conditions are similar to galactic atomic clouds . under normal conditions the [ ] emission from standard cnm makes only a small contribution to the total [ ] emission , however it may rise to @xmath145 of the total [ ] emission for individual positions .",
    "only minor fractions of the [ ] emission at the interaction zone and the nuclei can arise from regions .",
    "pdrs are the dominant source for the [ ] emission .",
    "we estimate minimum hydrogen masses associated with the [ ] emitting region of @xmath146 for the entire merging system and @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 within one beam centered at the interaction zone , ngc  4038 , and ngc  4039 , respectively . assuming a single emission component in the beam we derive a density of the [ ] emitting gas in pdrs of @xmath150 @xmath3 for the interaction zone and of @xmath151 @xmath3 and @xmath152 @xmath3 for ngc  4038 and ngc 4039 , respectively , and a far - uv intensity of @xmath153 for the interaction zone , @xmath154 for ngc  4038 , and @xmath155 for ngc  4039 .",
    "the derived beam filling factor of the emission from the pdrs is 20% for the interaction zone and 1015% for the nuclei .",
    "however , the pdr model also allows a solution with low density ( @xmath8  @xmath3 ) , high beam filling factor ( @xmath156% ) , and low fuv intensity ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "the low , beam averaged [ ] /co ratio of 2350 toward the interaction zone and the even lower ratios at the nuclei indicate that no global starburst is going on either in the area surrounding the interaction zone or in the nuclear region .",
    "the high - excitation lines observed with iso sws which trace the starburst must therefore arise from a small , confined region in the interaction zone .",
    "this result is also supported from the observations with isocam .",
    "therefore on the scale of our [ ] beam a single emission component for the pdr is only a crude approximation . using interferometric and single dish co observations and an expected [ ] /co ratio for starburst regions and for quiescent clouds",
    ", we constructed a two - component model consisting of a confined starburst region and of molecular clouds enveloping the starburst . from this model",
    "we find that the [ ] emission at the interaction zone originates partly from confined starburst regions and partly from surrounding quiescent clouds .",
    "if we apply this model to the nuclei we get also enhanced star formation activity in ngc  4039 with a low [ ] /co ratio for the quiescent clouds but only moderate star forming activity in ngc  4038 .",
    "this two - component model supports the high - density solution for the pdrs .",
    "future investigation of the antennae in the [ ] 205  fine structure line would be very helpful to further disentangle the origins of the [ ] line . also observations at higher spatial resolution in the fir regime ( e.g. with first and sofia ) would be a great step forward to investigate this and other spatially very complex objects in more detail .",
