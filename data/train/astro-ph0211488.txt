    "radial velocity surveys @xcite have discovered a significant population of giant extrasolar planets with orbits interior to the snow line of protoplanetary disks @xcite . these discoveries  together with the generally accepted theoretical belief that giant planet formation is difficult at such small radii @xcite  suggest that massive planet formation is often accompanied by orbital migration , which can be driven by gravitational interactions with the gas disk @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 of currently known systems that have semi - major axis @xmath1 are obviously prime candidates for having undergone migration , but theoretical models @xcite suggest that even this is an underestimate . @xcite have shown that the observed planets were probably preceded by earlier generations that failed to survive migration , while @xcite estimate that little or no migration ( defined as a fractional change in semi - major axis @xmath2 ) occurs in as few as 15% of systems with a surviving massive planet .",
    "if migration is indeed ubiquitous , it is reasonable to expect that it will affect both the formation and the survival prospects of co - existing terrestrial planets .",
    "several authors have studied the _",
    "dynamical _ stability of notional terrestrial planets in known extrasolar planetary systems @xcite .",
    "stable orbits that could in principle harbor terrestrial planets exist in most of these systems .",
    "the exhaustive study by @xcite concludes that at least 25% could host habitable terrestrial planets , while uninhabitable low mass planets could be present in a larger fraction of systems .    in this paper ,",
    "i investigate whether migration is likely to restrict the _ formation _ of terrestrial planets .",
    "it is fairly clear that a doomed giant planet , migrating inward toward eventual merger with the star , will cause any pre - existing low mass planets or planetesimals at smaller radii to be lost .",
    "what is less obvious is whether a subsequent generation of planetesimals ( and eventually planets ) could form from the potentially still massive disk present after the merger . to investigate this ,",
    "i describe in  2 a simple model for the evolution of gas and solids in the disk . in ",
    "3 , i present results for the surface density of solids at small radii following massive planet migration .",
    "i find that rather little material is likely to be able to repopulate the terrestrial planet forming region , and discuss in  4 the implications for the frequency of terrestrial planets .",
    "the evolution of the protoplanetary disk , and the coagulation of dust within it to form ( eventually ) planets , remain imperfectly understood .",
    "i describe here a simple three component model , for the evolution of gas , dust and planetesimals , that is intended only to capture the broad outlines of the probable behavior .    the gas component is modeled as a viscous accretion disk @xcite , with disk parameters chosen to reproduce the typical lifetimes @xcite and accretion rates @xcite of classical t tauri disks .",
    "the surface density @xmath3 evolves according to , @xmath4 - \\dot{\\sigma}_{\\rm wind } , \\label{eq_sigma}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the kinematic viscosity and the term @xmath6 allows for mass loss in a disk wind . for the viscosity",
    "i adopt , @xmath7 while for the mass loss a prescription motivated by observations and theoretical modeling of photoevaporation @xcite is used , @xmath8 the normalization of the mass loss is chosen such that the mass loss rate within 25  au is @xmath9 .",
    "the rate of surface density loss @xmath6 is constant in time .",
    "the initial surface density profile is , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the inner disk radius and @xmath12 is a scale radius chosen to truncate the initial profile .",
    "the constant @xmath13 is chosen such that the initial accretion rate at @xmath14 is @xmath15 . with these choices ,",
    "the initial disk mass is @xmath16 , and the disk lifetime is around 8  myr .",
    "these values are consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "solids in the disk are divided into two components , depending upon whether they are well - coupled to the gas ( colloquially ` dust ' ) or decoupled ( ` planetesimals ' ) .",
    "the dust component , of surface density @xmath17 , is treated as a trace contaminant to the dominant gas component , with concentration @xmath18 .",
    "this simplifies matters considerably , since the concentration obeys the equation @xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an effective diffusion coefficient and @xmath21 is the radial velocity .",
    "this equation allows for both advection of dust with the mean disk flow , and diffusion in regions of the disk where there is a gradient in the dust concentration .",
    "although both are byproducts of turbulence , there is no reason why the diffusion coefficient should equal the viscosity and @xmath20 could be determined via numerical simulations , though the properties of disk turbulence at the radii of interest remain subject to uncertainty due to the low ionization fraction and resulting suppression of the magnetorotational instability @xcite .",
    "there are also constraints on the efficiency of mixing processes from the isotopic heterogeneity inferred for the solar nebula @xcite . ] , but i assume that they have the same radial scaling and write @xmath22 , with @xmath23 a constant .",
    "initially , i take @xmath24 throughout the disk .",
    "the disk wind is assumed to entrain dust with it , leaving @xmath25 in the material left behind unaltered .",
    "coagulation of the dust will produce a population of larger ( km sized and upward ) bodies which are decoupled from the gas and follow keplerian orbits . eventually , these may form planets ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it is generally believed that the rate limiting step in this process occurs during the early phases of dust settling @xcite , and that rapid growth occurs through the size range where radial drift is rapid . in these circumstances a local prescription for converting dust into planetesimals suffices .",
    "i adopt the simple form , @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the surface density in decoupled solid bodies , and @xmath28 is a characteristic time for dust settling at 1  au @xcite .",
    "observations suggest that significant dust evolution occurs on myr timescales even at @xmath29 @xcite , which lends support to the theoretical conclusion that @xmath28 is short .",
    "i assume a fiducial value @xmath30 , but consider the effect of varying this parameter .",
    "if growing terrestrial planets attain masses of the order of @xmath31 prior to the dispersal of the gas disk , gravitational torques can once again couple the gas and solid components and drive rapid migration @xcite . by using equation ( [ eq_sigmadust ] ) , which ignores this effect",
    ", i am therefore implicitly assuming that the final stages of terrestrial planet formation occur subsequent to the loss of the disk . in the terminology of @xcite ,",
    "this is the ` slow ' mode of planet formation , which is often assumed to be appropriate for our own terrestrial planets @xcite .",
    "the possibility of an alternate , ` fast ' mode , in which type i migration is an essential element , is briefly discussed in  3 .",
    "equations ( [ eq_sigma ] ) and ( [ eq_c ] ) are solved on a non - uniform radial grid , with 200 mesh points extending from 0.067  au to 200  au .",
    "standard numerical methods suffice for both equations , and can be validated using analytic solutions to special cases of both the surface density equation @xcite and the contaminant equation @xcite .",
    "zero - torque boundary conditions are applied at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the basic evolution of the aforementioned model . the initial disk has a gas surface density at 1  au that exceeds the minimum mass solar nebula by a factor of about 5 , and extends out to a few 10 s of au . with dust diffusion and planetesimal formation parameters @xmath32 and @xmath30 ,",
    "the build up of solids decoupled from the gas is rapid in the inner disk , but requires of the order of a myr at 5 - 10  au .",
    "the final radial distribution of planetesimals is similar but not identical to the initial gas distribution .    once a massive planet has reached 1  au , the time remaining until merger is short . to a good approximation ,",
    "therefore , the influence of giant planet migration on the distribution of solid material in the inner disk can be modeled by instantaneously sweeping the inner disk clear of planetesimals at some specified time @xmath33 . by varying @xmath33",
    ", we can study the extent to which dust continues to advect and diffuse to small radii , and thereby form new planetesimals .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows @xmath27 at @xmath34 as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "the surface density of decoupled solid material is evaluated at the end of the calculation , after the gas in the disk has been lost . for the fiducial parameters of @xmath32 , @xmath30 , the final surface density of planet - forming material",
    "is heavily suppressed unless migration occurs extremely early  within the first @xmath35 . even taking into account the fact that , in the absence of migration , the final surface density of planetesimals is rather large ( substantially in excess of the minimum mass solar nebula value ) , it seems unlikely that a second generation of planetesimals would be formed in large enough numbers to permit terrestrial planet formation following migration .",
    "how sensitive is this conclusion to the rather uncertain input parameters of the model ?",
    "although the adopted @xmath30 has some theoretical support @xcite , taking @xmath36 is simply a plausible guess .",
    "since the concentration decreases toward small radii , where planetesimal formation is more rapid , more dust is able to repopulate the inner disk following migration if the efficiency of dust diffusion is enhanced . increasing the timescale on which dust forms planetesimals obviously has the same effect .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows that by adopting @xmath37 , or modestly increasing the planetesimal formation time to @xmath38 , the timescale on which migration could occur _ without _ detrimental effects on subsequent terrestrial planet formation can be lengthened to perhaps a myr .",
    "since the disk lifetime is almost an order of magnitude in excess of this @xcite , migration occurring at a random epoch would in most cases still inhibit terrestrial planet formation using these values .",
    "this would not be true if @xmath28 was as large as @xmath35 .",
    "however , with this @xmath28 a single e - folding time for dust destruction at 5  au is in excess of a myr .",
    "early giant planet migration would then be unlikely , simply because there would probably not have been time to form a massive planet at 5  au via core accretion @xcite in the first place .",
    "could low mass planets form further out in the disk , and subsequently migrate inward via gas interactions to fill the void at smaller radii ?",
    "this is conceivable .",
    "the rate of type  i migration ( in which the embedded planet fails to open a gap ) is not limited to the inflow velocity of the gas , and can be extremely rapid for earth mass planets at radii of the order of 1  au @xcite .",
    "if growing planets at somewhat larger radii attain such masses while the gas remains present , it is likely that they will suffer substantial radial migration , and pass through the terrestrial planet region .",
    "what is less clear is whether migration can be halted to leave terrestrial planets orbiting at small radii , given that the gas which drives migration will rapidly refill the inner disk following the passage of a massive planet . at very small radii ,",
    "interaction with the star or its magnetosphere @xcite provides a mechanism which can both halt migration , and allow further growth as additional low mass objects migrate inward @xcite .",
    "further out , it is possible that the existence of sharp edges in the disk  perhaps associated with the onset of efficient mhd turbulence within @xmath39 @xcite  could play a similar role @xcite .",
    "additional work is needed to assess the viability of these possibilities , and to determine how much gas would be accreted during the type  i phase .",
    "initial numerical simulations by @xcite and @xcite , which do not incorporate the complexities in the radial disk structure discussed above , find that both migration and accretion are very rapid for masses @xmath40 .",
    "this would suggest that earth mass planets migrating through the disk would accrete significant gaseous envelopes . simulations which include a treatment of the energy equation are needed to determine whether this is a robust result",
    ".    migration due to interactions with the gas disk is almost inevitable unless planets happen to form very close to the moment when the gas is dispersed .",
    "it is possible that further orbital evolution occurs subsequently , driven by purely gravitational interactions with planetesimals @xcite or other massive planets @xcite .",
    "these processes could also impact the probability of terrestrial planet formation .",
    "in particular , if dynamical interactions are the cause of extrasolar planet eccentricities , then an unstable multiple planet system must be a common outcome of the planet formation process .",
    "the relevant question for terrestrial planet formation is then not which orbits are unstable in the present - day system , but which orbits were swept free of planetesimals during the early chaotic evolution of a massive planet system",
    ". this could be substantially more restrictive of the possibilities for habitable terrestrial planets than the constraints derived so far .",
    "the main technical result of this paper is that inward migration of massive planets , if it occurs more than @xmath41 after the formation of the protoplanetary disk , is likely to suppress the subsequent formation of terrestrial planets at radii of the order of 1  au .",
    "this suppression occurs because the gas that flows in to the inner disk , after the migrating planet has merged with the star , is depleted of dust as a result of already having formed planetesimals at larger radii .",
    "it is possible to choose parameters such that this conclusion can be evaded , but this requires either slow conversion of dust to planetesimals ( in which case it is hard to see how the migrating massive planets could have formed , at least via core accretion ) , or very rapid diffusion of dust on a timescale an order of magnitude shorter than the disk s viscous timescale .    for future targeted searches of nearby stars for low mass planets ,",
    "the direct implication is that stars with ` hot jupiters '  massive planets at extremely small orbital radii of @xmath42 or less  may have been unable to form terrestrial planets , even though there are dynamically stable orbits for habitable planets in those systems @xcite . whether there are broader implications for the likely frequency of terrestrial planets depends first upon how common migration is , and second on whether there are stars that form terrestrial planets without forming any giant planets .",
    "the latter class of systems could certainly be common , though as their numbers are entirely unconstrained by existing observations any estimate is necessarily speculative .",
    "how common migration is among systems that form massive planets depends primarily on how fast migration occurs .",
    "if inward migration from a few au to merger with the star is rapid ( compared to the disk lifetime ) , then it requires fortuitous timing to form a giant planet at a moment , close to the disk dispersal time , when it will not migrate significantly .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite indicate that the migration timescale ( at least in the simplest disk models ) is short for planets formed close to the snow line , and this is reflected in migration being the rule rather than the exception in statistical models of the extrasolar planet distribution @xcite . among stars that either now possess massive planets , or _",
    "once formed _ massive planets that were subsequently lost , migration through to merger is likely to have occurred in the majority of systems @xcite . as a result ,",
    "it is possible that a high efficiency of massive planet formation could depress the frequency of terrestrial planets to a level substantially below the massive planet frequency ."
