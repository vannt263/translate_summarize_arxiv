    "in this introduction we first give an overview of our results .",
    "the overview starts with a review of well known counterparts of our constructions in algebraic topology .",
    "we then introduce our legendrian and lagrangian invariants in sections [ ssec : partwrap ] and [ ssec : infinteswrap ] , respectively , and discuss the connection between them and applications thereof in section [ ssec : connections ] .",
    "finally , in section [ ssec : hopflink ] we give detailed calculations of the invariants introduced in the simple yet illustrative example of the legendrian hopf link filled by two lagrangian disks intersecting transversely in one point .",
    "the starting point for our study is a construction in classical topology .",
    "consider the following augmented dg - algebras over a field @xmath22 associated to a based , connected , topological space @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the singular cochain complex equipped with the cup - product and @xmath26 is the singular chain complex of the based loop space of @xmath27 equipped with the pontryagin product .",
    "( we use cohomologically graded complexes throughout the paper so that all differentials increase the grading by 1 . ) in the case of singular cohomology , the inclusion @xmath28 gives the augmentation @xmath29 and in the case of the based loop space , the augmentation is given by the trivial local system @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath27 is of finite - type ( for example , a finite cw - complex ) , then it is well known that one can recover the augmented dg - algebra @xmath25 from the augmented dg - algebra @xmath26 by the eilenberg - moore equivalence : @xmath31 in the other direction , if @xmath27 is _ simply connected _ , then the adams construction gives a quasi - isomorphism @xmath32 and in this case @xmath25 and @xmath26 are said to be _ koszul dual _ dg - algebras .",
    "koszul duality is sometimes abbreviated and simply called _",
    "duality_. for more general @xmath27 , using the method of acyclic models , brown @xcite constructed a twisting cochain @xmath33 this is a degree 1 map that induces a dg - algebra map @xmath34 . by definition , the latter is a quasi - isomorphism when duality holds , and this can be detected by an associated _ koszul complex _ , which is acyclic if and only if duality holds . in the general case",
    ", @xmath35 is a certain completion of @xmath26 and consequently @xmath26 is a more refined invariant of @xmath27 than @xmath35 .    in this paper",
    ", we pursue this idea in the context of invariants associated to lagrangian and legendrian submanifolds . here the role played by simple connectivity in the above discussion have two natural counterparts , one corresponds to a generalized notion of simply - connectedness for intersecting lagrangian submanifolds and the other is the usual notion of simply - connectedness for legendrian submanifolds .",
    "we start with the geometric data of a liouville domain @xmath1 with convex boundary @xmath4 and an exact lagrangian submanifold @xmath36 with legendrian boundary @xmath37 .",
    "we assume that @xmath38 , that the maslov class of @xmath2 vanishes ( for grading purposes ) and that @xmath2 is relatively spin ( to orient certain moduli spaces of holomorphic disks ) .",
    "assume that @xmath2 is subdivided into embedded components intersecting transversely @xmath39 and that @xmath7 is subdivided into connected components @xmath40 . to avoid notational complications , we take both parametrized by the same finite set @xmath41 and assume that the boundary of @xmath42 is @xmath43 .",
    "we use a base field @xmath22 and define the semi - simple ring @xmath44 generated by mutually orthogonal idempotents @xmath45 .",
    "also , we fix a partition @xmath46 into two disjoint sets , and choose a base - point @xmath47 for each @xmath48 .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us restrict , in this introduction , to the following situation :    * @xmath1 is a subcritical liouville domain , * if @xmath49 then the corresponding legendrian @xmath43 is an embedded _",
    "sphere_.    from a technical point of view , these restrictions are unnecessary .",
    "we make them in order to facilitate the explanation of the meaning of our constructions for legendrian surgery .",
    "( note that , the topology of @xmath43 is unrestricted when @xmath48 . )",
    "we write @xmath50 for the completion of the liouville `` sector '' obtained from @xmath1 by attaching critical weinstein handles along @xmath43 for each @xmath51 and cotangent cones @xmath52 along @xmath43 for each @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath54 , @xmath55 is an ordinary liouville manifold . in general",
    ", it looks like a neighborhood of the zero section in the cotangent bundle @xmath56 , for some @xmath57 , outside a compact subset .",
    "hence it is a geometrically bounded manifold , gromov compactness holds @xcite , and holomorphic curve theory is well - behaved .    in @xmath55 , for @xmath58 , there is a closed exact lagrangian submanifold @xmath59 , the union of the lagrangian @xmath42 in @xmath1 and the _ lagrangian core disk",

    "dually , for each @xmath51 , we obtain ( non - compact ) exact lagrangian disks @xmath63 , the _ lagrangian cocore disks _ of the weinstein handles attached to @xmath43 on @xmath1 , and for each @xmath53 , we construct _ dual _ lagrangians disks @xmath63 intersecting @xmath42 once and asymptotic to a legendrian meridian of @xmath42 ( these can be constructed as the cotangent fiber at the point @xmath64 , @xmath65 , in @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the base points on @xmath43 ) .    the invariants that we will construct",
    "are associated to the union of lagrangian submanifolds @xmath68 the lagrangian @xmath69 will be referred to as a _ lagrangian skeleton _ of @xmath55 , it is a union of lagrangian submanifolds which intersect transversely .",
    "the dual lagrangian @xmath70 is the union of lagrangian disks which can be locally identified with cotangent fibers to irreducible components of @xmath69 .",
    "we will study two algebraic invariants associated to @xmath71 .",

    "it corresponds to the endomorphism algebra of @xmath70 considered in the partially wrapped fukaya category of @xmath50 .",
    "however , we will take the pre - surgery perspective as in @xcite and construct all these invariants by studying legendrian invariants of @xmath75 rather than floer cohomology in @xmath55 . from this perspective",
    ", the case @xmath76 is a new construction , that generalizes the theory from @xcite in a way analogous to how partially wrapped fukaya categories @xcite generalizes wrapped fukaya categories @xcite .    the invariants @xmath73 and @xmath74 come equipped with canonical augmentations to the semi - simple ring @xmath77 and it is easy to see by construction that @xmath73 is determined by @xmath74 via the equivalence : @xmath78 the duality which would recover @xmath79 from @xmath80 holds in the `` simply - connected '' case ( see section [ algkoszul ] ) . in the topological case",
    "discussed above , this is analogous to the simply - connectedness assumption on @xmath27 , which makes the augmented algebras @xmath25 and @xmath26 koszul dual .",
    "in fact , the topological case is a special case of our study for the weinstein manifold @xmath81 , with the lagrangian skeleton @xmath82 given by the 0-section , and the dual lagrangian @xmath70 given by a cotangent fiber @xmath83 .",
    "we next sketch the definition of our version of the chekanov - eliashberg dg - algebra ( without any assumption of simply - connectedness ) .",

    "while writing this paper , we learned that z. sylvan independently considered a similar conjecture @xcite in relation with his theory of partially wrapped fukaya categories @xcite .",

    "this is an instance of _ koszul duality _ between the @xmath72 algebras @xmath132 and @xmath137 .",
    "this duality has many useful implications .",
    "for example , it implies an isomorphism between hochschild cohomologies : @xmath144 when @xmath145 , an isomorphism defined via a surgery map @xcite was described between _",
    "symplectic cohomology _ , @xmath146 , and the hochschild cohomology @xmath147 .",

    "for example , the duality holds for plumbings of simply - connected cotangent bundles according to an arbitrary plumbing tree , see theorem [ plumbs ] .    in another direction , combining duality and floer cohomology with local coefficients , we establish the following result for relatively spin exact lagrangian fillings @xmath153 with vanishing maslov class of a legendrian submanifold @xmath5 .",
