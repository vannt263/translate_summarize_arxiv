    "the active manipulation of spin - dependent electron transport is the principal task in spintronics  @xcite .",
    "one of the effective way to achieve spin polarization of electrons injected into semiconductors is spin - dependent tunnelling through a barrier in ferromagnetic metal / insulator / semiconductor heterostructures @xcite .",
