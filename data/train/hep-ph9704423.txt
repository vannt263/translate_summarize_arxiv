    "recently the cleo collaboration has presented a first measurement of some exclusive @xmath7 modes @xcite .",

    "unfortunately electroweak penguins play in certain cases an important role and even spoil some of these methods @xcite . because of this feature rather complicated strategies  @xcite are needed that are in most cases  requiring e.g.  the geometrical construction of quadrangles among @xmath0 decay amplitudes  very difficult from an experimental point of view .",
    "a much simpler approach to determine @xmath1 was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it uses the branching ratios for the decays @xmath9 , @xmath10 and their charge - conjugates .",
    "if the magnitude of the current - current amplitude @xmath11 contributing to @xmath10 is known ( we will discuss this point in more detail later ) , two amplitude triangles can be constructed with the help of these branching ratios that allow in particular the extraction of @xmath1 .    since experimental data for @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "is now starting to become available , we think it is an important and interesting issue to analyze the implications of these measurements for @xmath1 and the description of these decays within the standard model in general .",

    "first , non - trivial bounds on @xmath1 of the structure @xmath14 where @xmath15 is related to the ratio of the combined branching ratios ( [ br - char ] ) and ( [ br - neut ] ) , can be obtained .",
    "second , the ratio @xmath6 of the current - current amplitude @xmath16 to the penguin amplitude @xmath17 contributing to @xmath3 can be constrained .",

    "if the amplitude ratio @xmath6 should lie far off its standard model expectation and cleo should measure a cp - violating asymmetry in @xmath3 that is considerably larger than the corresponding bounds on that observable obtained along the lines proposed in our paper , one would have indications for physics beyond the standard model .    in section  [ formulae ]",
    "we set the stage for our discussion by giving the formulae for the decay amplitudes of @xmath20 and @xmath21 within the standard model .",
    "quantitative estimates for the branching ratios of these decays are presented in section  [ estimates ] .",
    "there we also emphasize the importance of penguins with internal charm - quarks to get results of the same order of magnitude as the recent cleo measurements . the formula for @xmath15 constraining @xmath1 through ( [ gamma - bound1 ] ) is then derived in section  [ bounds ] , where we also give analytical expressions for bounds on @xmath6 and @xmath19 following from a measurement of the combined branching ratios ( [ br - char ] ) and ( [ br - neut ] ) . in section  [ discussion ]",

    "the amplitude @xmath33 in ( [ ampl - neut ] ) is a short - hand notation for the penguin contributions to @xmath21 , i.e.@xmath34    whereas it is straightforward to show that the current - current amplitude @xmath11 can be written in the standard model as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a cp - conserving strong phase and @xmath1 the usual angle of the unitarity triangle , the penguin amplitude @xmath33 is more involved .",
    "here one has to deal with three different contributions corresponding to penguins with internal up- , charm- and top - quark exchanges .",
    "taking into account all three of these contributions and _ not _ assuming dominance of internal top - quarks as is frequently done in the literature ( we will comment on this point in section  [ estimates ] ) , it can be shown that the @xmath30 penguin amplitude @xmath33 takes the following form  @xcite : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is again a cp - conserving strong phase arising from final state interactions , while only a trivial cp - violating weak phase appears in ( [ pen ] ) as @xmath39 .",

    "neglecting these contributions and using the @xmath59 isospin symmetry of strong interactions allows us to relate the penguin amplitude @xmath33 relevant for @xmath3 to the @xmath2 decay amplitude through @xmath60 the magnitude of the right - hand side of this equation can be obtained from the measured @xmath2 branching ratio with the help of ( [ av - br - char ] ) .",
    "consequently we get the following relation : @xmath61 where the very small phase space difference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 has been neglected and the relevant @xmath8 lifetime and mass ratios have been set to unity .",

    "these terms may lead to cp asymmetries in @xmath106 that are at most of @xmath107 and consequently affect the relation ( [ no - cp ] ) to a very small extent @xcite .",
    "= 9.8 cm    as was stressed in @xcite , a consistent calculation using next - to - leading order wilson coefficients requires the inclusion of the penguin - like matrix elements of the current - current operators discussed above .",
    "the point is that the renormalization scheme dependences of these matrix elements cancel those of the @xmath108 s leading to the scheme independent wilson coefficients @xmath97 . on the other hand ,",
    "using leading order wilson coefficients @xmath109 , these matrix elements have to be dropped so that we have in this case @xmath110\\,{\\cal f}\\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using numerical values for the wilson coefficients , we find that the contribution of the electroweak penguin operators to @xmath92 is below the @xmath107 level so that the approximation of neglecting the @xmath28 contributions ( see the comment before ( [ ptilde - det ] ) ) seems to be on solid ground . evaluating the branching ratios for the penguin mode @xmath2 corresponding to ( [ pen - fact ] ) and ( [ pen - simple ] ) , we find ( as can be seen already in the tables given in @xcite ; see also @xcite ) that the penguins with internal charm - quarks lead to a dramatic enhancement .",

    "consequently in this rather simple model calculation the penguin matrix elements with internal charm - quarks lead to an enhancement of br@xmath117 by a factor of @xmath118 and to a reduction of @xmath6 by @xmath119 .",
    "interestingly the cleo result ( [ br - charres ] ) does already rule out the lo curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : br - est ] .",
    "the nlo result , however , still has some dependence on @xmath112 which will disappear once a nonperturbative calculation of the matrix elements becomes available .",
    "still the agreement with the present cleo data is remarkable although it is a bit on the lower side .    in a similar spirit",
    "we can arrive at some estimate of the cp - conserving strong phase defined in ( [ def - delta ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath120 if we use ( [ pen - simple ] ) for @xmath92 . including the important penguin matrix elements with internal charm - quarks through ( [ pen - fact ] )",
    "gives values of @xmath43 within the range @xmath121 . in spite of all the caveats connected with factorization we still consider it safe to extract the sign of @xmath122 from this discussion .",

    "finally we want to stress that none of the crude estimates discussed above are needed for the analysis presented in section [ discussion ] .",

    "the quantity @xmath126 turns out to be very useful . neglecting the small phase space difference between @xmath3 and @xmath2 and using ( [ untag - neutral ] ) , ( [ av - br - char ] ) and ( [ ptilde - det ] ) yields @xmath127 where the ratio of the relevant @xmath8-meson lifetimes and masses has been set to unity as in ( [ simple - acp ] ) .",

    "another way would be to relate @xmath16 to some current - current dominated process .",
    "assuming flavor @xmath143 , a possible mode is @xmath144 which receives only color - allowed and color - suppressed current - current and negligibly small electroweak penguin contributions . including factorizable @xmath143-breaking we obtain @xcite @xmath145 ) with ( [ tprime - det ] ) .",
    "unfortunately the @xmath146 mode has not yet been measured . however , recently the cleo collaboration has reported the following upper limit for the corresponding branching ratio  @xcite : @xmath147 which can be translated easily into an upper bound on @xmath6 . using the minimal and central values",
    "@xmath148 and @xmath149 of the branching ratio in ( [ br - charres ] ) , ( [ tprime - det ] ) leads to @xmath150 respectively .",
    "however , given all the assumptions leading to these bounds , we shall not exclude the possibility of having a larger value of @xmath6 within the limits ( [ range - r ] ) in what follows and consider all quantities as functions of @xmath6 .",
    "= 9.8 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] we plot the constraint on @xmath1 as a function of @xmath6 . as usual",
    "we shall assume that @xmath1 ranges between @xmath151 and @xmath152 which is determined from cp violation in the kaon system  @xcite .",
    "due to the two possibilities for the sign of @xmath122 we have to discuss two cases . for positive @xmath122",
    "the sign of @xmath153 is the same as the one of @xmath132 .",
    "thus for @xmath154 we can constrain the angle @xmath1 between @xmath151 and @xmath155 . for the small window @xmath156 , which is still allowed due to the large experimental uncertainty , @xmath132 becomes negative for @xmath157 implying that @xmath1 lies within the range @xmath158 in that case .",
    "if @xmath122 is negative , the situation reverses .",
    "it is obvious that the constraint on @xmath1 becomes more restrictive the smaller the value of @xmath128 is . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] , @xmath159 is an important special case .",
    "the point is that for @xmath160 one can always constrain @xmath1 independent of @xmath6 , while @xmath156 requires some knowledge about @xmath6 . for @xmath154 the maximal value of @xmath15 is given by @xmath161 in particular , if @xmath128 is significantly smaller than one , we may place stringent restrictions on @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , taking the central value of the cleo measurement we have @xmath162 ; for a value at the lower end of ( [ r - exp ] ) we have even @xmath163 .",
    "if one is to take the lower limit in ( [ r - limits ] ) corresponding to @xmath164 serious , one finds @xmath165 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : acp ] we show the dependence of @xmath166 on @xmath6 for various values of @xmath128 within the experimental range ( [ r - exp ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the case of @xmath1 it is impossible to constrain that cp asymmetry without any knowledge of @xmath6 .",
    "coming back to the previous example , we have @xmath167 for @xmath168 and @xmath6 bounded by the lower value of  ( [ r - limits ] ) .",
    "in the present paper we have shown that a measurement of the combined branching ratios ( [ br - char ] ) and ( [ br - neut ] ) allows to obtain useful constraints on @xmath1 and direct cp violation in @xmath169 even with rather large experimental uncertainties .",
    "needless to say , an improvement on the experimental side will sharpen the bounds on @xmath1 substantially , in particular it would be useful to further constrain @xmath128 to the region @xmath154 .",
    "obviously another important step would be a separate measurement of the @xmath9 , @xmath170 and @xmath10 , @xmath171 branching ratios which may lead to a determination of @xmath1 as proposed in @xcite .",
    "looking at the bounds on @xmath1 we have derived in the present paper , they are complementary to what is obtained from a global fit of the unitarity triangle using experimental data on @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath40@xmath52 mixing and cp violation in the neutral @xmath174-meson system  @xcite . typically that range for @xmath1 using present data is @xmath175 note that the allowed range is symmetric around @xmath176 , while in our approach we _ exclude _ a range symmetric with respect to @xmath177 for @xmath154 .",

    ", this means that @xmath1 has to be either between @xmath180 and @xmath181 or between @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "based on the discussion of section  [ estimates ] we conclude that the former range is the preferred one since most probably @xmath123 . in the case of the central value of ( [ gamma - normal ] ) , i.e.  @xmath184 , we have @xmath185 and get therefore the relation @xmath186 between @xmath6 and @xmath128 independent of the value of @xmath43 . note that in this case necessarily @xmath156 . using our bound ( [ r - limits ] ) on @xmath6 implies thus @xmath187 for @xmath184 . if @xmath6 should be of @xmath188 as expected , we would practically fix @xmath128 to be @xmath189 . however , this corresponds to the upper end of the present cleo range . if @xmath1 is close to @xmath177 , future measurements either have a value of @xmath128 close to unity or it will become increasingly difficult to accommodate the situation within the standard model .",
    "although some of our bounds are independent of the ratio @xmath6 , this quantity is still one of the main ingredients of the presented approach .",
    "the range implied by pure consistency given in ( [ range - r ] ) is quite generous .",
    "using other input to access @xmath16 and @xmath190 , such as factorization for the color - allowed current - current amplitude or data on @xmath144 , consistently indicates small values of @xmath6 .",
    "it is interesting to note that these smallish values are already at the edge of compatibility with the cleo measurements .",
    "another important experimental task is to search for direct cp violation in @xmath3 which would immediately rule out `` superweak '' models of cp violation @xcite . ruling out these scenarios with the help of that cp asymmetry is , however , not the only possibility ; if one should measure cp - violating effects in @xmath3 that are inconsistent with the upper limits on @xmath191 obtained along the lines proposed in our paper one would also have indications for physics beyond the standard model .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated that the combined @xmath0 branching ratios reported recently by the cleo collaboration may lead to stringent constraints on @xmath1 that are complementary to the presently allowed region of that angle obtained with the help of the usual indirect methods to determine the unitarity triangle .",
    "these measurements provide in addition a powerful tool to check the consistency of the standard model description of these decays and to search for `` new physics '' . in this respect direct cp violation in @xmath3",
    "is also expected to play an important role .",
    "once more data come in confirming values of @xmath154 , the @xmath0 modes discussed in our paper may put the standard model to a decisive test and could open a window to `` new physics '' .",
