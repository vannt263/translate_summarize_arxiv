    "in gauge theories , the coulomb gauge has special position .",
    "the number of dynamical variables is the same as the number of physical degrees of freedom . moreover ,",
    "if we go to the hamiltonian , phase - space , first - order formalism , there are no ghosts ; and , because of the existence of a hamiltonian , unitarity should be manifest .",
    "nevertheless , there are complications , if not problems , with the coulomb gauge . in the lagrangian , second - order , formalism , there are ` energy - divergences ' in individual feynman graphs",
    ". these are divergences over the energy - integration , @xmath0 , in a loop , for fixed values of the 3-momentum @xmath1 .",
    "these are difficult to regularize : dimensional regularization does not touch them , and any other regularization risks doing violence to gauge - invariance ( but see leibbrandt et al for a modified form of dim .",
    "these energy - divergences do cancel when all graphs are combined @xcite ; but it makes one uneasy to be manipulating divergent and unregulated integrals .",
    "the problem of energy - divergences is eased by going to the hamiltonian , phase - space , first - order formalism , in which time derivatives of the gluon field @xmath2 are eliminated in favour of the conjugate momentum field @xmath3 .",
    "this has the advantage of being a true hamiltonian formalism , and unitarity should be manifestly obeyed . also , there are no ghosts ( ghost loops cancel part of the closed coulomb loops ) . for a sample calculation in this formalism",
    "see @xcite , and for possible connection to confinement see @xcite .",
    "but there are still problems .",
    "there is a question of operator - ordering in the hamiltonian @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) , which may require higher - order terms .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that these operator - ordering problems are connected with ambiguous multiple energy - integrals in higher orders .    in this paper , we are concerned with a simpler problem , which arises at 2-loop order . in general , in the hamiltonian formalism to this order , the two integrals over the internal energies converge with the two internal spatial momenta held fixed . however , renormalization demands that we first perform the energy and momentum integrals for each subgraph , then make subtractions for ultraviolet divergences , and then perform the remaining energy and momentum integrals . with this sequence of operations ,",
    "one does in general find an energy - divergence in the final energy integral .",
    "we illustrate this with a simple example in which quark - loop subgraphs are inserted into the second - order gluon self - energy graphs .",
    "we perform the energy - momentum integral in the subgraph first , then do the renormalization subtraction .",
    "individual graphs now have energy - divergences in the final energy integral , but these cancel when graphs are combined .",
    "we show that the cancellation is a consequence of the ward identities obeyed by the quark - loop sub - diagrams .",
    "of course , it is reassuring to check that the energy - divergences do cancel .",
    "but we are back in the uncomfortable position of having to handle divergent ( and unregularized ) integrals at intermediate stages of the cancellation .",
    "this contrasts with the feynman gauge , where all integrals to all orders are unambiguously regularized by dimensional regularization .",
    " *p * bf",
    "p    lorentz indices are denoted by greek letters , spatial indices by @xmath4 , and colour indices by @xmath5 .",
    "we use the metric tensor @xmath6 , where @xmath7 lorentz vectors are written @xmath8 we define the lorentz tensor @xmath9 by @xmath10 and for any vector @xmath11 we define the vector @xmath12 by @xmath13 ( of course , these definitions refer to the particular time - like vector @xmath14 with respect to which we have chosen to define the coulomb gauge . )",
    "we define a spatial transverse tensor @xmath15 by @xmath16 so that @xmath17    in terms of colour matrices @xmath18 , @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 and in terms of the structure constants @xmath21 , @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 the renormalized coupling constant is @xmath24 .",
    "quarks have mass @xmath25 .",
    "we use dimensional regularization with spacetime dimension @xmath26 .",
    "the lagrangian density in the phase - space formalism is @xmath27 where @xmath28.\\ ] ]    the hamiltonian form of the coulomb gauge has dynamical , conjugate fields @xmath29 .",
    "the coulomb potential @xmath30 is not a dynamical variable",
    ". it could be eliminated , but we find it convenient to leave it in the feynman rules .",
    "we use a continuous line to represent @xmath3 , a dashed line for @xmath2 and a dotted line for @xmath30 .",
    "the propagators are not diagonal in @xmath31 .",
    "the propagators are shown in fig.1 ( the arrows on the lines show the direction of the momentum @xmath32 ) .",
    "only one vertex will be relevant to our calculation , that shown in fig.2 .",
    ", dashed lines @xmath33 and dotted lines @xmath34 .",
    "the arrow indicates the sense of momentum flow.,width=234 ]        its value is @xmath35 in the hamiltonian formalism , this is the only vertex involving the coulomb field .",
    "it is this feature which implies there are no energy - divergences to 1-loop order .",
    "we are going to insert quark loops into a gluon diagram , so we need a notation for quark 1-loop effective action .",
    "let the 2-gluon term in this effective action be ( in momentum space ) @xmath36 we will require to know @xmath37 only for @xmath38 in this region , we have @xmath39,\\ ] ] ( using minimal subtraction with a mass unit @xmath40 ) .    the 3-gluon term in the effective action will be denoted by @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and the quantum numbers of the three gluons are @xmath43 ( all momenta are directed into the vertex ) .",
    "we will not need to know the value of @xmath44 in general .",
    "finally the 4-gluon term in the effective action will be denoted as @xmath45 where the quantum numbers are @xmath46 .",
    "again , we do not need to know the value of @xmath47 in general .",
    "both @xmath48 and @xmath47 have the symmetries required for bose symmetry .",
    "note that the effective action due to quark loops is a functional of @xmath49 , and does not depend upon @xmath3 .",
    "there are terms in the effective action which involve the coulomb field @xmath30 , and this is the reason that energy - divergences re - appear .",
    "renormalization requires also the presence of counter - terms with a different structure from the interactions in the original formalism .",
    "the effective action obeys the following ward identities : @xmath50,\\ ] ] @xmath51 @xmath52 these identities express the gauge invariance of the quark loop contribution to the effective action .",
    "they are a special case of the brs identities ( see for example itzykson and zuber equation ( 12 - 144 ) ) when there are no ghost contributions @xcite .",
    "we shall show that these identities are sufficient to ensure the cancellation of energy - divergences between graphs .",
    "the simplest example of the energy - divergences occurs in the gluon 2-point function , to 2-loop order .",
    "the relevant graphs are shown in fig.3 , where the thick circles represent terms from the quark - loop effective action ( in ( 12 ) , ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) ) . in fig.3(vi ) , the sum of the three subgraphs shown corresponds to ( 15 ) .",
    "we then see that ( 19 ) , ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) are each divergent as integrals over @xmath62 for fixed @xmath1 .",
    "( actually , for @xmath63 this is true only of the contributon from the subtraction term in ( 13 ) . )",
    "if we take the limit @xmath64 first , then we get a double log energy - divergence .    to find the behaviour of the integrals in ( 22 ) , ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) , it is sufficient to use the ward identities ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) in the large @xmath62 limit",
    ". then ( 16 ) gives @xmath65 also , @xmath66 @xmath67 similarly , ( 17 ) implies that @xmath68\\ ] ] @xmath69 using ( 27 ) again .    from ( 27 ) , ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) , we see that all the integrals in ( 18 ) have energy - divergences of the same kind , and the divergent part has the form @xmath70,\\ ] ] where @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74@xmath75 @xmath76 these last six expressions cancel , so the energy - divergences in the separate terms in ( 18 ) cancel out in the sum .",
    "probably similar cancellations occur in two - loop graphs made entirely of gluon lines .",
    "but in this case there is the extra complication of the ambiguous integrals connected to the christ - lee terms @xcite @xcite .",
