    "it has been understood for some time that the structure of a galaxy can be affected by tidal interactions with its close neighbour(s ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; tell - tale signs such as tidal tails and disturbed morphologies provide a visible record of these encounters . around our own galaxy ,",
    "there is substantial evidence for its tidal interaction with the small and large magellanic clouds ( smc and lmc ) , the consequences of which have been studied in detail ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; these streams represent material that has been stripped from infalling satellites as they are disrupted by our galaxy .",
    "the detection of such streams will become more commonplace in the coming years as the sensitivity of surveys improve ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there are already examples of stellar streams further afield , such as around m31 @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite recently reported the discovery of intracluster light in the virgo cluster , revealing several long ( @xmath3100 kpc ) tidal streamers .",
    "these results represent compelling evidence that satellite galaxies tidally interact with their more massive hosts , and consequently lose some fraction of their mass .",
    "the effect of a satellite s interaction with its host and the mass loss it suffers has been studied in some detail ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the importance of a satellite galaxy s interactions with other satellite galaxies , the nature of these interactions and the contribution they make to its mass loss is less well understood .",
    "there is evidence to suggest that tidal interactions _ between _",
    "satellite galaxies occur ; @xcite and @xcite investigated whether the sagittarius dwarf galaxy could have experienced an encounter with the smc and lmc some 23 gyrs ago , while the disturbed hi distribution noted by @xcite in the m81 group is highly suggestive of tidal interactions between the group galaxies .",
    "@xcite argues that tidal interaction between galaxies is the dominant mechanism driving cluster galaxy evolution and underpins the butcher - oemler effect and the morphology - density relation .",
    "+ it has been understood for some time that dark matter haloes must play an important dynamical role in encounters between galaxies because they significantly reduce the merging timescale @xcite .",
    "examples of tidal interaction and merging are observed in relatively low - density environments ( i.e. the field ) , but how reasonable is it to expect that interactions should be more common in higher density environments such as galaxy groups and clusters ?",
    "tidal interactions have been proposed as a mechanism for galaxy transformation in galaxy clusters , such as the  harassment \" scenario envisaged by @xcite , but what does the favoured paradigm for cosmological structure formation , the cold dark matter model , predict ?    the aim of this paper is to quantify the importance of satellite - satellite encounters and to assess their impact upon the transformation and mass loss of the substructure population within the context of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model .",
    "we have drawn on a sample of high resolution cosmological n - body simulations of cluster mass dark matter haloes and analysed the interactions of the substructure haloes ( hereafter subhaloes ) both with the host halo and with other subhaloes .",
    "we associate these subhaloes with the hosts of satellite galaxies ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in what follows we use the terms subhalo and satellite ( galaxy ) interchangeably .",
    "the fine time sampling of our simulations allow us to follow the time evolution of subhalo properties in detail , and so we can determine the relative contributions of the host and the other subhaloes to changes in a subhalo s structure .    in a previous study @xcite we quantified the frequency of encounters between subhaloes orbiting within a common cdm cluster mass halo , considering the period between the halo s formation redshift for the haloes we examined . ] and the present day .",
    "we found that , on average , @xmath4 of the  satellite galaxy \" population experienced at least one encounter per orbit with another satellite galaxy .",
    "this result was sensitive to the age of the host halo , with a clear trend for more encounters in younger systems .",
    "we also reported a correlation between the number of encounters and halocentric radius  satellite galaxies closer to the centre of the host were measured to experience more interactions , although we note that this simply reflects the increasing spatial density of satellites with decreasing radius within a host halo .",
    "the principal shortcoming of the approach adopted in @xcite is that we neglected the relative velocities of the satellite galaxies ; our satellites may have experienced encounters , but we had no information about their specific nature , i.e. were they fast or slow ?",
    "such information is important when considering the impact on the satellite s structure . in this present study ,",
    "we elaborate on that work by including information about the relative velocities of the satellites .",
    "in other words , we can now estimate the _ importance _ of encounters in addition to the frequency with which they occur , allowing us to differentiate between _ slow _ encounters , which we expect to be extremely disruptive to the satellite structure , and _ fast _ encounters , whose impact are likely to be minimal .",
    "we define a quantitative measure for interactions , which we call the _ integral interaction measure _ , based upon the force acting on a satellite over a given period of time , i.e. the ( induced ) momentum change .",
    "whereas before we could examine the number of encounters a satellite galaxy experienced per orbit , we may now study how the instantaneous force due to encounters acting on a satellite galaxy varies along its orbit and how this correlates with mass loss , thus providing a natural measure of the importance of mutual interactions between satellite galaxies .",
    "in what follows , we motivate our choice of the integral interaction measure ( hereafter iim ) as a gauge for the importance of interactions between satellite galaxies , and present the results of our analysis of a suite of high resolution cluster mass haloes that formed assuming the  cosmology .",
    "we demonstrate the suitability of the iim for our purposes by performing a series of experiments with `` cleaned '' simulations , in which we track the detailed mass loss history of a single satellite galaxy in a host halo in which the substructure has been removed .",
    "finally , we compare and contrast our results with those of previous studies , and comment on their observable consequences .",
    "our analysis is based on a suite of eight high - resolution simulations @xcite carried out using the publicly available adaptive mesh refinement code ` mlapm `  @xcite in a standard  cosmology ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "each run focuses on the formation and evolution of a dark matter galaxy cluster containing of order one million particles , with mass resolution @xmath6  and force resolution @xmath72  which is of the order 0.05% of the host s virial radius .",
    "these simulations have the required resolution to follow the satellites within the very central regions of the host potential ( @xmath8510% of the virial radius ) and the time resolution to resolve the satellite dynamics with good accuracy ( @xmath9170  myrs ) .",
    "such temporal resolution provides of order 10 - 20 timesteps per orbit per satellite galaxy , thus allowing these simulations to be used in a previous paper @xcite to accurately measure the orbital parameters of each individual satellite galaxy .",
    "substructure within these haloes is identified using the halo finder ` mhf `  ( ` mlapm`s - halo - finder ) . `",
    "mhf `  is based upon the  code ` mlapm`and acts with exactly the same accuracy as the  code itself ; it is therefore free of any bias and spurious mismatch between simulation data and halo finding precision arising from numerical effects .",
    "we applied ` mhf `  to each of our eight host halos at their formation time which is the redshift  where the halo contains half of its present day mass .",
    "we track the orbits of each of the satellites identified within and around the host halo from until @xmath10 and follow the evolution of their properties in great detail .",
    "for further details relating to the properties of the satellite galaxies , we refer the reader to the @xcite series of papers .",
    "in what follows , we have considered only those satellites that have completed at least one full orbit within their host halo , corresponding to more than 70% of the subhaloes .",
    "the number distribution of orbits peaks at about 12 orbits with the tail extending to as many as four orbits for the older host halos . a detailed discussion of the orbital properties ( amongst others ) of the substructure population can be found in @xcite .",
    "we restricted our sample of satellites to those that contain at least 100 particles , which translates to a minimum mass of @xmath11 . to ensure that our results are not affected by resolution effects",
    ", we checked that all results presented below are recovered when the lower mass limit is gradually increased ; that is , we considered additional lower mass cuts corresponding to 200 and 400 particles and we can confirm that our results are unaffected .",
    "we begin by calculating the forces acting on each satellite galaxy @xmath12 for each available snapshot of the simulation , treating it as a point particle with mass @xmath13 .",
    "the force @xmath14 exerted by the host halo and the force @xmath15 exerted by all other satellites are given as follow    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the mass of satellite @xmath12 and @xmath18 the mass of the host interior to the satellite distance @xmath19 .",
    "we need to stress that both these formulae assume spherical symmetry and hence are only approximations to the `` true '' forces .",
    "we define a so - called ( dimensionless ) `` integral - interaction - measure ''  iim  for each individual satellite galaxy as follows :    @xmath20    where we integrate over a time interval @xmath21 $ ] , which is the time satellite @xmath12 has spent within its host s virial radius . here",
    "we also note that due to our definition the iim values scale linearly with the  average satellite mass \" .",
    "the discrete nature of the time sampling of our data requires that the integral should be expressed as the following summation :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the age of the universe at redshift @xmath10 , @xmath24 the age of the universe when the satellite enters the host halo , and @xmath25 the time difference between two consecutive outputs .",
    "we average the forces exerted by both the other satellites and the host halo over the consecutive outputs , i.e. [ @xmath26 $ ] , or `` mid - point integration '' of equation  ( [ iimintegral ] ) :    @xmath27    the integral - interaction - measure equation  ( [ iim ] ) can now be used as a quantitative measure for the relative strength of satellite - satellite encounters .      in fig .",
    "[ msatiim ] we present the integral - interaction - measure @xmath28 , as defined by equation  ( [ iim ] ) , for each satellite in our suite of eight host halos plotted as a function of satellite mass .",
    "this figure suggests that there is no clear trend for interactions to correlate with mass , as we might have expected ; it would be rather surprising to find that , for instance , high - mass satellites tend to interact more prominently than low - mass ones ( or vice versa ) .    the most striking feature of fig .",
    "[ msatiim ] is the apparent rise of the @xmath28 values as a function of decreasing age for the host halos : the halos are ordered in age with halo  # 1 being 8.3 gyrs old and halo  # 8 a mere 3.4 gyrs .",
    "this can be better viewed in fig .",
    "[ niim ] where we plot the distributions of the integral interaction measure iim . for all our eight host halos",
    "these distributions have been fitted with a log - normal function    @xmath29    corresponding best fit parameters along with the halo age are listed in table  [ ageiim ] where iim@xmath30 = iim@xmath31 for a log - normal distribution .",
    ".best fit parameters of iim distribution to lognormal .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from table  [ meanmassloss ] we infer that the mass loss induced by satellite - satellite encounters can amount to as much as 45% of the total mass loss experienced by a single satellite . even though the integral interaction measure iim ( as defined by equation  ( [ iim ] ) ) and its distribution in fig .",
    "[ niim ] indicated a rather low importance of such interactions the conversion to mass loss reveals a more pronounced influence due to the observed power law scaling @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "however , the results are robust to changes in the power - law index , e.g. changing the exponent from @xmath34 to unity gives us the range from 15% mass loss due to interactions for the oldest host ( halo  # 1 ) up to 40% for the youngest system ( halo  # 8) .",
    "two questions remain unanswered :    1 .",
    "[ 1 ] why do we observe a higher mass loss due to interactions in younger systems ? 2 .",
    "[ 2 ] can our results be verified ?",
    "the most natural approach to addressing these questions involves explicitly tracking the mass loss of an individual satellite as a function of time and factoring out the influence of the other satellites . to do this ,",
    "we have performed two additional simulation runs of halo  # 8 , both starting at its formation redshift @xmath35 . in the first , we have removed all halos bar the progenitor of the @xmath10 host halo and one particular satellite that happened to have a rather high interaction value of @xmath36 ; our analysis indicates that about 40% of its average mass loss per gyr was induced by interactions with other satellites . in the second run",
    ", we removed only those subhaloes that have not merged with the host s progenitor at redshift @xmath10 except our  test satellite \" .",
    "we refer to these runs as  fully cleaned \" ( the former , including _ only _ the host and our test satellite ) and  cleaned \" ( the latter , also including the massive subhaloes merging with the host ) respectively .    a visual impression of the initial setup of the cleaned run is given in ( the upper left panel of ) fig .",
    "[ sat55orbit ] which nicely demonstrate the  smoothness \" of the cleaned simulation . the satellite in question",
    "is marked by a blue circle .",
    "for each of the three runs we closely follow the mass loss history of this satellite and the resulting curve ( normalized to the initial mass ) is presented in fig .",
    "[ sat55masshistory ] .",
    "note that we identify the set of particles that are bound to the satellite at the initial time and we explicitly track these particles through subsequent snapshots , checking what fraction are bound to the satellite at later times .",
    "this avoids any difficulties that may arise from attempting to identify the bound mass of the satellite as it is identified in subhalo catalogues constructed for consecutive snapshots . for each available output",
    "we find the new satellite centre by using the centre - of - mass of the innermost bound particles as a first guess for the central density peak .",
    "we then iteratively remove all of the satellite s particles that are not gravitationally bound .",
    "[ sat55masshistory ] shows that the mass loss suffered by the satellite is significantly reduced in both of the cleaned runs .",
    "however , we stress that removing all substructure not only affected the satellite under investigation but also the overall dynamics of the host , especially for the fully cleaned run : host halo  # 8 can be classified as a violent ( triple ) merger in the original cosmological simulation and removing all of its progenitors must clearly leave an imprint on its ( internal ) dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , we note that although the `` cleaned '' run retained most of its high mass substructures , we observed a trend for the mass loss to decrease .     from initial redshift @xmath37",
    "to @xmath38 through the actual (  normal \" ) simulation as well as out two test cases described in section  [ testcase].,width=302 ]     to @xmath10 .",
    "the solid line represent the power law @xmath39.,width=302 ]        this simple test has demonstrated that the principal driver for interaction induced mass loss is the mass spectrum of the substructure halos .",
    "we may strengthen this statement further by considering the cumulative circular velocity distribution presented in fig .",
    "[ nvcirc ] . noting that the maximum circular velocity is a reasonable measure of halo mass , we conclude from this figure that a sizeable fraction of the mass in satellites in each of the eight host haloes is bound to high mass systems roughly half way through their evolution ( i.e. @xmath40 ) .",
    "these massive subhaloes are likely to be responsible for the increased mass loss due to interactions , as already indicated by fig .",
    "[ sat55masshistory ] .",
    "we can investigate this assertion by determining the fraction of the iim measure that is due to massive satellites . as already mentioned in section  [ iimmeasure ]",
    ", we can reproduce the distributions of iim values presented in fig .",
    "[ niim ] by including only those satellite galaxies that are more massive than 1% of the host s virial mass , the mass limit of 1% @xmath41 corresponds to a cut in circular velocity at around 20% @xmath42 ( cf .",
    "[ nvcirc ] ) . ] .",
    "this indicates quite clearly that the iim values are dominated by more massive systems and the contribution of low - mass satellites is negligible .",
    "the hierarchical manner in which structure in our universe forms  from the bottom up , through mergers and accretions  implies that interactions between galaxies ( and consequently , between their dark matter haloes ) are commonplace .",
    "these interactions have been invoked to explain , for example , galaxy transformation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the exchange of angular momentum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the triggering of star bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and morphological change @xcite .",
    "the impact of interactions between satellite galaxies and their massive host on the structure of the satellites has been studied in some detail ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but less well understood is the role played by interactions between satellite galaxies ; in other words , the impact of satellite - satellite interactions . this important topic has formed the basis of this paper .",
    "we have defined an _ integral interaction measure _ ( iim ) that allows us to quantitatively measure the importance of interactions between satellite galaxies for their mass loss .",
    "our definition allows us to gauge the relative contributions of the host potential and other satellites for the mass loss suffered by an individual satellite .",
    "we have shown that the distribution of iims for a population of satellites within a cluster mass dark matter halo can be characterised as lognormal , and that the peak value ( or mode ) correlates with the age of the host system  typically the younger the host , the larger the peak iim . moreover , we note that the relative width of the distribution is broader in younger systems",
    ". we were able to confirm that the most significant contribution to the interaction measure comes from massive companion satellites which naturally explain the correlation with host age : subhaloes in young clusters have larger masses relative to the host since they have not been tidally disrupted yet which is validated by the observation that our younger hosts have a higher mass fraction in satellites .",
    "however , the iim values are generally much less than unity , implying that the bulk of the mass loss suffered by a satellite is driven by its interaction with the host potential .",
    "we have also shown that , in those cases where the iim is large , it can not be due to single encounters ; rather , it is built up through a series of many encounters .",
    "our investigations have also extended the result of @xcite by demonstrating that not only are penetrating encounters between satellite galaxies relatively rare events over the `` lifetime '' of a cluster , but that the timescale of such encounters is short , i.e. the relative velocities are typically of order the 1d velocity dispersion of the host .",
    "this result may be of interest to those engaged in developing semi - analytic models of galaxy formation because we might expect the severity of encounters between satellites to be important for the efficiency of starbursts arising from tidal interactions .",
    "finally we have proposed a simple _ empirical _ model for separating the respective contributions of the host potential and interactions with other satellites for the mass loss suffered by a satellite .",
    "our model suggests that mass loss driven by satellite interactions can be significant  in the particular test case we considered , we have shown that a given satellite can lose as much as @xmath43 of its initial mass .",
    "this may appear surprising at first , but we have shown that the iim is a cumulative measure and so while damaging encounters are relatively rare occurrences , a large number of `` weak '' interactions can affect the structure of a satellite and drive the mass loss it suffers .",
    "however , we stress that this empirical model should be taken as simple guide providing an `` order - of - magnitude '' estimate of the mass loss , and a more sophisticated model is required ; this will be the focus of future work .",
