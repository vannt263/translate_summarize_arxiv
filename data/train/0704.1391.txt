    "they key point in our calculation is that we convert the usual functional integral into a path integral where the direction in which the physical parameters change is treated like a fictitious time variable within the path integral formalism .",
    "the authors have already applied this approach to electrostatic problems where it has proved to be efficient for carrying out computations for films @xcite , interfaces @xcite and in cylindrical geometries such as lipid - tubules @xcite .",

    "however , our approach is slightly different and self - contained .",
    "hence , for the sake of completeness ( and because the results seem to be relatively unknown ) we have included a detailed description of this approach .",
    "in particular , we have shown how to generalize the pauli - van vleck formula for the evolution kernel of all theories of this type .    as a model system",
    "we have considered a toroidal lipid membrane with one very large circumference and the other finite of length @xmath25 , with a stripe of width @xmath7 wrapped around the finite circumference and of different , minority , lipid type to the bulk , majority , type .",
    "this is shown schematically in figure [ fpol ] .",
    "this geometry imposes periodic boundary conditions on the system .",
    "we have shown how to compute , in general , two important energies in this system , namely the energy , or line tension , associated with the lipid - lipid interface and the casimir force between the interfaces , as a function of width @xmath7 .",
    "an important controlling parameter , @xmath71 , has the dimensions of a mass and is given by @xmath167 .",
    "we have presented these calculations explicitly for the cases where @xmath168 and @xmath169 , where @xmath78 is the inter - lipid spacing .",
    "these correspond , respectively , to the cases where the actual area , @xmath130 , or the projected area , @xmath13 , is conserved . in the latter case , we calculate the mean excess area of the system @xmath170 in section [ bulk - stripe ] . in both cases ,",
    "the interface energy is positive and the casimir force attractive as can be seen from equations ( [ lenergy]),([fczero ] ) , ( [ fgnonzero ] ) and the associated figures .",
    "our general result is that in appropriate dimensionful units the energy coefficient is @xmath171 where , at maximum , @xmath172 .",
    "this is to be compared with the natural bending rigidity with lies in the range @xmath173 .    the general case where @xmath174 is complicated and long , and although we have the results we have not presented an explicit analysis in the @xmath164 parameter space because of the complexity .",
    "however , there is no computational or algebraic impediment to carrying this out .    in terms of relevance to the physical system we might consider two scenarios in the two - lipid model discussed here . either the minority lipid",
    "can be dissolved in the majority lipid to form a homogeneous phase for the mixture , or the minority lipid can precipitate out of solution and form a pure minority phase , the stripe in our idealized case , within the pure majority phase .",
    "which situation is stable is , of course , decided by a competition between the free energies of the configurations which is in turn dependent on the boundary conditions imposed .",
    "however , it is clear that the attractive casimir force will tend to reduce the stripe width @xmath7 , presumably by evaporation of minority lipid from the interface into solution .",
    "the interface energy is constant throughout such a process but will always tend to minimize the interface length . a stability analysis , however , requires a computation of the free energy of the mixed phase which our calculation does not address .",
    "however , as has been discussed in @xcite , the suppression of lipid mode fluctuations by confining the membrane in a stack will change the free - energy of both configurations and so can affect their stability ; an effect which can be analyzed by our methods .",
    "in this appendix we show how generalized quadratic path integrals can be evaluated giving a generalization of the pauli - van vleck formula .",
    "the treatment is very close to that of @xcite and is based on the chapman - kolmogorov decomposition of the path integral .",

    "the path integrals arising in section [ model ] are , of course , for the case @xmath184 which , as mentioned above , also arises for the path integrals of stiff or semi - flexible polymers .",
    "we also refer the reader to the approach of @xcite which is based on an eigenfunction expansion method for the case @xmath184 .",
    "now one must state how the initial and final points of the path integral should be specified .",
    "the presence of the term @xmath185 means that the paths that contribute to the path integral are ones where the derivatives @xmath186 and lower must be continuous .",
    "the path integral should therefore be specified in terms of the vector @xmath187 where we have used the notation @xmath188 .",
