    "astrophysicists are convinced that the observable universe is in a phase of rapid accelerated expansion and commonly termed it ` dark energy ' ( de ) possessing negative pressure and positive energy density .",
    "this conclusion has been supported by several astrophysical data findings of supernovae sne ia @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiations via wmap @xcite , galaxy redshift surveys via sdss @xcite and galactic x - ray @xcite .",
    "although the phenomenon of dark energy in cosmic history is very recent @xmath1 , it has opened new areas in cosmology research .",
    "the most elegant and simple resolution to de is the cosmological constant @xcite but it can not resolve fine tunning and cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "hence theorists looked for other alternative models by considering the dynamic nature of dark energy like quintessence scalar field @xcite , a phantom energy field @xcite and f - essence @xcite .",
    "another interesting set of proposals to de puzzle is the ` modified gravity ' ( including @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 etc ) which was proposed after the failure of general relativity to explain the de puzzle .",
    "this new set of gravity theories passes several solar system and astrophysical tests @xcite .",
    "a gravitational theory can be constructed on a non - riemannian ( weitzenbock ) manifold where the properties of gravity are determined through torsion of spacetime and not curvature .",
    "some earlier attempts in this direction were made by einstein himself and other researchers .",
    "a recent version of torsion based gravity is @xmath0 @xcite , where @xmath4 is the torsion scalar constructed from the tetrad .",
    "choosing @xmath5 , leads to the teleparallel gravity @xcite and is in good agreement with some standard tests of the general relativity in solar system @xcite .",
    "numerous features of theoretical interest have been studied in this gravity already including birkhoff s theorem @xcite , cosmological perturbations @xcite and phantom crossing of the state parameter @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the local lorentz invariance is violated which henceforth leads to violation of first law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "also the entropy - area relation in this gravity takes a modified form @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian structure of @xmath0 gravity has been investigated and found that there are five degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the torsion based theory is also an alternative candidate to the mechanism of cosmic inflation @xcite .    in teleparallel gravity ,",
    "the equations of motion for any geometry are exactly the same as of general relativity . due to this reason ,",
    "the teleparallel gravity is termed as ` teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ' . in teleparallel gravity ,",
    "the dark energy puzzle is studied by introducing a scalar field with a potential .",
    "if this field is minimally coupled with torsion , then this effectively describes quintessence dark energy .",
    "however if it is non - minimally coupled with torsion , than more rich dynamics of the field appears in the form of either quintessence or phantom like , or by experiencing a phantom crossing @xcite .",
    "xu et al @xcite investigated the dynamics and stability of a canonical scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity ( arising from torsion ) .",
    "they found that the dynamical system has an attractor solution and rich dynamical behavior was found . in the context of general relativity ,",
    "a scalar field non - minimally coupled with gravity has been studied in @xcite .",
    "we here extend these previous studies by replacing @xmath4 with an arbitrary function @xmath0 .",
    "we found that such a dynamical system possess no stable equilibrium point , however rich dynamical behavior of quintessence and phantom energy is observed .",
    "we follow the following plan : in section ii we write the action and equations of motion of our model . in section",
    "iii , we give motivation for choosing particular forms of model functions . in section iv , we write the dynamical system in dimensionless form and discuss its stability and phase space behavior . in section",
    "v , we discuss the cosmological implications of our model related to present accelerated universe .",
    "we provide conclusion in section vi .",
    "we are interested in conformally invariant models i.e. models which remain invariant under conformal transformation . under the rules @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 , the equations of motion and the whole action remain invariant of a conformally invariant model . here",
    "@xmath9 is the tetrad ( vierbein ) basis . in general for a @xmath10dimensional gravity model , the conformal coupling parameter @xmath11 so that in a four dimensional theory , @xmath12 @xcite . further @xmath0 theories from dynamical point of view are completely different under conformal transformation unlike @xmath13 theory .",
    "its not possible to rewrite the total action of @xmath0 gravity in form of teleparallel action plus scalar field @xcite .",
    "it shows that even the pure @xmath0 model behaves differently under conformal transformation .",
    "we propose an action of @xmath0 gravity conformally and non - minimally coupled with a scalar field as ] @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is a conformal coupling parameter of order unity while @xmath17 represents quintessence and phantom energy respectively .",
    "the dynamical quantity of the model is the tetrad and scalar field @xmath18 with a scalar potential @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the matter lagrangian .",
    "it is assumed that both matter and scalar field are distributed as perfect fluid .",
    "the action ( [ action ] ) can be considered as a generalization of a teleparallel gravity non - minimally coupled with a scalar field @xcite .",
    "we add some more comments on our model : the minimally coupled scalar fields are not conformal invariant , otherwise @xmath0 gravity is not local lorentz invariance . after the lorentz symmetry breaking , we prefer our model must have conformal symmetry . just for pure @xmath0 ,",
    "it is well - known that it can be possible to write the pure @xmath0 action in a conformal gauge , like @xmath2 .",
    "if we couple matter ( here scalar field ) with @xmath0 , this matter part must have the same ( conformal ) symmetry which can be interpreted as a generalized conformal invariance .",
    "we assume a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric as a background spacetime @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a scale factor and @xmath23 .",
    "the equations of motion are obtained by varying the action ( [ action ] ) w.r.t . @xmath22 and @xmath24",

    "we notice that the system of dynamical equations admit no stable critical point .",
    "the first critical point a is trivial one while point b contains an undetermined component @xmath36 . for a , @xmath37 @xmath38 while for b , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , thus both a and b are unstable points .    .",
    "solid line ( dot - dash ) corresponds to @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) . ]",
    "in this section , we will give some cosmological implications of our model by numerically solving the dynamical equations . in the top panel of figure-1 , the three dimensional phase space of @xmath44 , @xmath45 ,",
    "@xmath46 is plotted for two different values of @xmath47 . the top left figure ( for @xmath43 )",
    "shows that the trajectory starts from @xmath48 causing a negative friction term @xmath49 in the klein - gordon equation .",
    "the friction term gets less dominant while scalar field and potential energy parameters dominate in the later evolution .",
    "it shows that the late stage evolution is determined by scalar potential alone .",
    "this fact is also evident from bottom left figure that only potential term dominates the dynamics while scalar field and the kinetic term do not contribute in cosmological dynamics .",
    "however , putting @xmath42 in the dynamical system reverses the dynamical evolution of system as shown in right panel in fig.1 .",
    "the scalar potential remains vanishing while the cosmic dynamics are determined by kinetic term @xmath50 and scalar field .",
    "it shows that @xmath51 leads to kinetic term ( scalar potential ) dominated regimes in the late time evolution , despite the system evolves from same initial conditions ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) .    in figure 2",
    "we show the time evolution of scalar fields and logarithmic energy densities for @xmath57 .",
    "the top left figure shows that for phantom energy , the field undergoes successive stages of fluctuations after a time gap of unity . here",
    "the amplitude of phantom scalar field in each successive stage becomes progressively less than the previous stage . in the late time evolution",
    ", it is expected that the field will lose its energy and fluctuations decrease , as seen in bottom right figure .",
    "however for quintessence , the top left figure shows that field decays for @xmath58 , and corresponding log energy density stays around @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we define the equation of state parameter of the scalar field @xmath61 where @xmath62,\\\\ p^{\\text{eff}}_\\phi&=&\\frac{-2}{(1+\\alpha)(1+\\xi\\phi^2)}\\big [ -\\frac{(\\alpha+1)}{2}h^2(1+\\xi\\phi^2)\\nonumber\\\\&&-2\\xi(1+\\alpha)\\phi\\dot\\phi h-\\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\dot\\phi^2+\\frac{1}{2}v(\\phi)+\\frac{c\\sqrt{6}\\xi}{3}\\phi\\dot\\phi\\big]\\nonumber\\\\&&-\\frac{1}{3}\\big [ \\rho_m+\\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon\\dot\\phi^2+v(\\phi)-3h^2[(\\alpha+1)\\xi\\phi^2+\\alpha]\\big ] .\\label{pdot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in figure-3 , we plot the time evolution of the effective eos parameter of the scalar field @xmath63 for two available values of @xmath47 . adopting the same initial conditions as in previous figures , we observe that the state parameters for both models evolve from the same initial value @xmath64 which is a phantom state for the state parameter",
    ". however the later evolution follows opposite trajectory i.e. for @xmath43 , the state parameter goes on to take more negative values with time , thereby evolving to super - phantom state . for @xmath42",
    ", the state parameter initially behaves like phantom and slowly evolves to cross the @xmath65 boundary , while again returning to phantom regime in the late time evolution .",
    "to summarize , we investigated the stability and phase space of a non - minimally conformally coupled scalar field in @xmath0 cosmology .",
    "we found that the dynamical system of equations admit two unstable critical points , thus no attractor solutions exist in this cosmology . treating the scalar field as quintessence and phantom energy",
    "separately , we found that for phantom energy , the late stage evolution is determined by the potential energy in phase space while for quintessence case , it is kinetic energy term that plays central role . furthermore , the time evolution of phantom scalar field undergoes progressive stages of fluctuations while loosing energy density and ending up to the value @xmath66 in the relevant scale . for quintessence ,",
    "the scalar field remains stable for long time with a constant energy density .",
    "it is interesting to note that our model correctly predicts the present state of the universe is dominated by phantom energy while it will remain so in the far future .",
    "further , we observed that the transition of the state parameter crosses the cosmological boundary twice in the case of quintessence field only .",
    "also we noted that @xmath51 leads to kinetic term ( scalar potential ) dominated regimes in the late time evolution , despite the system evolves from same initial conditions .",
