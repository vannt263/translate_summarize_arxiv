    "the first and second derivatives of this function are @xmath167 and @xmath168 respectively , where @xmath169 denotes the expression under the square root in ( [ hubble2 ] ) .",
    "loitering occurs around the extremal point , i.e. , the zero of ( [ prime ] ) .",
    "we immediately see that this equation has only one zero , and only when the _ lower _ sign is chosen ( brane1 model ) , namely , at @xmath170 it then follows from ( [ double ] ) that the second derivative is strictly positive at this point ; thus , we are dealing with a true minimum of @xmath171 .",
    "we need to evaluate the hubble parameter at this point and to ensure that it is only _ slightly _ greater than zero ( the condition of loitering ) .",
    "we have @xmath172 where the extremal point @xmath173 is the solution of ( [ extremum ] ) .",
    "one can see that this model requires _ positive _ value of the bulk cosmological constant , hence , embedding of the brane in the five - dimensional de  sitter space rather than anti - de  sitter space . as can be seen from ( [ extremum ] ) , this model requires also @xmath174 i.e. , @xmath175 .",
    "the universe in this model eventually evolves to the de  sitter phase @xmath176 \\ , , \\ ] ] which implies the following restriction ( no ` quiescent ' singularity in the future  see @xcite ) : @xmath177    in principle , we could have the condition @xmath178 , in which case @xmath179 i.e. , the hubble parameter would tend to approximately the same value that it had at the loitering point @xmath173 .",
    "since the behaviour of @xmath171 is monotonic after the extremum , this implies that , beginning from the loitering point , the universe is effectively in the de  sitter state with the hubble parameter given by ( [ ds1 ] ) .",
    "thus , there is no loitering phase as such in this case , but the universe proceeds directly to the de  sitter phase , which should be expected since the brane1 model ( [ hubble2 ] ) in the limit @xmath180 passes to the randall  sundrum model , which does not admit spatially flat loitering solutions without dark radiation .",
    "however , if the condition @xmath181 is realized , then @xmath182 and the universe evolves to a much higher expansion rate after the period of loitering .",
    "the loitering braneworld model without dark radiation that we arrived at in this section may be problematic from the viewpoint of braneworld theory since it is embedded in de  sitter , rather than anti - de  sitter , five - dimensional space .",
    "we have demonstrated that a loitering universe is possible to construct within the framework of braneworld models of dark energy .",
    "an important aspect of braneworld loitering is that , in contrast to the conventional loitering scenarios that demand a closed universe , loitering on the brane can easily occur in a spatially flat cosmological model .",
    "a key role in making the brane loiter is the presence of ( negative ) dark radiation  a generic five - dimensional effect associated with the projection of the bulk gravitational degrees of freedom onto the brane .",
    "our universe can loiter at large redshifts ( @xmath0 ) while accelerating at the present epoch . during loitering , the value of the hubble parameter decreases steadily before increasing again . as a result",
    ", the age of the loitering braneworld is larger than that of a lcdm universe at a given redshift .",
    "this feature may help spur the formation of @xmath183 black holes at redshifts @xmath184 whose presence ( within high redshift qso s ) could be problematic for standard lcdm cosmology @xcite . , we find that the age of a loitering universe at @xmath2 can be several times that in lcdm cosmology , which is less than a billion years old at that redshift . ]",
    "loitering is also expected to increase the growth rate of density inhomogeneities and could , in principle , be used to reconcile structure formation models which predict a lower amplitude of initial ` seed ' fluctuations with the observed anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , an early loitering phase could lower the redshift of reionization from its currently high value of @xmath185 for the lcdm model @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to draw attention to the fact that earlier work on braneworlds has emphasized departure from the standard friedmannian behaviour either in the distant past ( @xmath186 ) @xcite or else , in the current epoch and remote future ( @xmath187 ) @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we have shown that a braneworld can also show interesting significant departures from the conventional behaviour at _ intermediate _",
    "redshifts @xmath0 .",
    "it is meaningful to ask ourselves whether this feature of braneworld cosmology is a unique aspect of the higher - dimensional action ( [ action ] ) or whether such properties are shared by a larger class of modified gravity and string - inspired models .",
    "perhaps future work will throw light on this question .",
    "_ acknowledgments _ : it is a pleasure to thank kandaswamy subramanian , subhabrata majumdar and carlo contaldi for stimulating discussions and alexei starobinsky for valuable comments on an early version of the paper .",
    "the authors acknowledge support from the indo - ukrainian program of cooperation in science and technology sponsored by the department of science and technology of india and ministry of education and science of ukraine .",
    "as pointed out in sec .  [ loitering ] , while not all loitering models pass through a minimum of the hubble parameter , a minimum value of the ratio @xmath188 is generic and is exhibited by all models .",
    "it is therefore useful to supplement the definition of loitering given in ( [ eq : loit ] ) by defining the loitering redshift @xmath129 as the epoch associated with the minimum of @xmath188 ( both models are assumed to have the same value of @xmath80 ) . in order to quantify the degree of loitering , it is useful to introduce the function @xmath189 where @xmath190 .",
    "small values @xmath191 imply _ weak loitering _ , whereas larger values @xmath192 correspond to _",
    "strong loitering_. it is straightforward to derive expressions for the loitering redshift @xmath18 and the degree of loitering @xmath145 : @xmath193 @xmath194 which are valid under the single assumption @xmath195 , or @xmath196      in practice , it is often convenient to take the values of @xmath80 , @xmath199 , and @xmath145 as control parameters and to determine the approximate ranges of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 from equations ( [ xextr])([b ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : param_space ] , we show , as an example , the range of allowed values for the parameter pair @xmath200 for a model which loiters at @xmath201 and has @xmath202 .",
    "it is necessary to draw the reader s attention to the fact that not every set of parameter values gives rise to a ` realistic ' cosmology .",
    "for some of them , the universe recollapses before reaching the present epoch .",
    "( the loitering braneworld shares this property with a closed frw universe , and the reader is referred to @xcite for an extensive discussion of this issue . )",
    "it is obvious that the model approaches a recollapsing universe as the loitering parameter @xmath203 .",
    "thus , setting @xmath204 in estimate ( [ b ] ) , we obtain the approximate boundary of the region of recollapsing universes in the parameter space @xmath200 : _ c _ 34 _ m^2 ( 1 + z_loit)^2  , which corresponds to the ` prohibited ' region in fig .",
