    "this degradation of the sis performance can be substantial for the faint x - ray background spectra since the position depenedence of the sis performance change is not known for the _ diffuse _ background emission .",

    "the night - earth data are available from the heasarc _ asca _ guest observer facility ( gof ) , which is an accumulation of the data from 1993 june to 1999 august . since the night - earth background is known to have long - term variations over the years , the data taken only between 1998 january and 1998 may are extracted in order to accomodate the observation dates of our data .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] , the histograms present the radial profiles ( arbitrarily scaled ) of the data to blank - sky intensity ratio where the night - earth contribution is subtracted from both . within 15@xmath18 radius of the nominal field of view , no statistcally significant intensity variation is observed . the same analysis has been performed in the soft and the hard band .",
    "the results from these subbands also indicate no significant intensity variations over the field .",
    "since the effect of the shadow is not explicitly seen in the images , off - cloud observations may be necessary to assure the utility of the x - ray shadow in constraining the distribution of the soft dxb emission along the line of sight .",
    "no such observations are currently available leaving it for follow - up observations .",
    "the solid angle of our data is however only 30@xmath18 diameter and is _ completely _ within the angular extent of the shadow .",
    "no intensity variation in the soft band image is thus not surprising considering no significant column variations around the central region of the cloud ( p98 ) and the limited field of view for the data covering only the central region of the shadow .",
    "the smooth distribution in the hard band image may also be reasonable since the cloud is most likely _ transparent _ on average in the 2 @xmath2 9 kev band ( @xmath27 @xmath28 1 )",
    ". there may be some contribution from the off - cloud emission due to the `` stray - light '' effect ( see  [ subsec : arf ] ) .",
    "for example , the contribution from offset angle @xmath12 1@xmath13 is expected to be @xmath10 15% of the total counts in the 1 @xmath2 2 kev band ( the contribution in the hard band is expected to be smaller ) @xcite . the bulk of the observed flux in the soft band is thus assumed to arise in on - cloud region presumably representing the x - ray emission originating in the foreground of the cloud .",

    "mirror responses @xcite",
    ". a specific energy response of the detector must be generated to resolve this problem .",
    "for this purpose an ancillary response file ( arf ) for the diffuse emission is generated through ray - tracing , assuming an _ uniform _ x - ray emitter having 1.5@xmath13 radius .",
    "this technique is essentially identical to those by kaneda et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and valinia et al .",
    "although the diffuse arf is created for the galactic diffuse emission , it is also used in determining the normalization for the extragalactic power law .",
    "this specific arf is utilized in the following spectral analysis .",
    "as the first step of the spectral analysis the nxb is subtracted using night - earth data .",
    "the extragalactic power law component of the dxb ( presumably from unresolved agns ) then needs to be considered since the contribution from this component in the photon energy of @xmath122 kev is significant even in the plane .",
    "the power law component of the dxb has been extensively studied with high latitude data and can be described with a photon index of @xmath29 @xmath4 1.4 in the 2 @xmath2 10 kev band @xcite .",
    "this extragalactic power law component is included in the spectral fitting as a fixed component . in order to produce an appropriate normalization of the power law component ,",
    "blank - sky data are fitted with a simple power law model in the 0.8 @xmath2 9 kev band after subtracting the nxb .",

    "we found that the difference due to the assumed n@xmath31 values in this range does not affect the fit , and a fixed value of n@xmath31 = 4 @xmath7 10@xmath32 @xmath9 is used for the analysis .",

( 1997 ) with _ asca _ data and the best fit temperature of @xmath47 kev was obtained for the hard component . on the other hand , presence of a power - law hard - tail in the grxe spectrum in addition to the thermal components has been suggested @xcite . as a matter of fact , the grxe as observed with _",

    "the ionization state of the grxe has thus been uncertain and the previous results have been dependent on different assumptions in the models .    considering the complex nature of the modeling grxe plasma , in this paper , we assume that thermal plasmas are in ionization equilibrium , as a first step toward the understanding of the nature of `` x - ray shadow '' . our results in this paper may be subject to the assumption of ionization equilibrium , on which further investigations will be required .",
