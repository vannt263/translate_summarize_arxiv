    "ever since the discovery of iron - based superconductors in 2008 @xcite , an avalanche of research effort was aimed at understanding the pairing mechanisms behind the origins of superconductivity in these materials @xcite .",

    "the study of iron - based materials even more elusive is that some experimental data suggest that the antiferromagnetic and superconducting order parameters compete in certain systems , while they coexist in others @xcite . in very recent times",
    "it has been suggested that magnetic and structural instabilities can potentially form the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "however , in order to understand the nature of the superconducting state and its underlying mechanism , it is imperative to gain insight into a materials electronic structure @xcite .",
    "one of the most relevant approaches to studying the electronic structure of superconductors has come in the way of exploring their magnetic responses to an external magnetic field , _ h _ , as a function of temperature , _",
    "t_. in the case of bcs superconductors , the upper critical field , @xmath3 , has been used as a measure of electronic coherence @xcite , as well as an indicator of the relevant pairbreaking mechanisms @xcite .",
    "detailed analyses of the @xmath4 phase diagrams of iron pnictides and chalcogenides have been utilized to suggest that they are multi - band superconductors with unconventional pairing mechanisms @xcite .    here , we report a striking persistence of superconductivity against high magnetic fields in the iron chalcogenide film fete : o@xmath0 below 2.52 k. the measured low - temperature @xmath3 increases progressively , showing a pronounced inflection , instead of the saturation expected from a mean - field theory with a single order parameter .",
    "this suggests the presence of a large supply of superconducting states accessible via magnetic field . additionally , our observations suggest that the rapid reduction of the upper critical field with increasing temperature ( concomitantly with the superfluid density ) is a consequence of thermal fluctuations involving these states .",
    "we explore a scenario of cooper pairs with finite center - of - mass momentum and find that , while not perfectly justifiable , it is consistent with our data below @xmath5 k. our findings reveal a fundamental characteristic of superconductivity and electronic structure in the strongly - correlated iron - based superconductors .    the procedure for the fete : o@xmath0 film deposition was described in detail elsewhere @xcite , albeit the lower @xmath2 of the present sample compared to the one discussed by si _",
    "@xcite ( a zero - field temperature scan of the resistivity exhibits a @xmath2 of 7.05 k , when in order to obtain the superconducting transition we consider the mid - point of the normalized resistivity , 50@xmath6 of @xmath7 ) .",
    "currently , the mechanism of oxygen - induced superconductivity in fete : o@xmath0 films is still unknown @xcite .",
    "further investigations to sort out the effects of oxygen in this class of films present an important scientific objective for the field . here , however , we focus exclusively on the behavior of superconductivity due to the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "ac transport measurements of the parallel and perpendicular components of @xmath3 with respect to the crystallographic _",

    "the most remarkable observation here is the unusual persistence of superconductivity against high magnetic fields at low temperatures , manifest in an inflection of the phase boundary of the @xmath4 phase diagram ( figure 2 ) , which is clearly present in the @xmath16 case , and less drastically in the @xmath15 one .",
    "apparently , at low temperatures ( @xmath27 k ) , the superconductivity survives much stronger fields by readjusting itself in some non - trivial way .",
    "this is in great contrast to the phase diagram saturation characteristic of a bcs superconductor described by a mean - field theory of a single order parameter . generally speaking ( without involving any specific theory )",

    "the thermal fluctuations involving these states cause the rapid reduction of @xmath3 ( and the superfluid density ) as the temperature increases . given the large gap size of the system ( @xmath28 ) @xcite , such fluctuations are likely in the phase ( not amplitude ) of the order parameter . this strong coupling behavior is expected in the underdoped samples @xcite ( like the present one ) with correlated electronic structure @xcite , as evident from the proximity to magnetic / orbital / structural orders .",

    "_ argued that the much larger @xmath32 s in comparison to the @xmath36 measured in a fete@xmath37se@xmath38 single crystal suggests that these observations could imply the importance of paramagnetic pair - breaking effects , or be due to multi - band scattering in the latter system @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding the above interpretation , both whh and cc are derived in the weakly - coupled limit , while their validity in a strongly coupled , non - bcs system such as fe(te , se ) remains dubious @xcite .    within bcs ,",
    "the finite momentum superconductivity is explained within the fflo picture @xcite .",
    "this should be considered as one possible scenario consistent with the above general considerations , but not necessarily representing the only ( or even the correct ) microscopic picture .",
    "the fflo state is marked by a smaller condensation energy , but also by a lower zeeman energy , compared to the normal state , resulting in an overall suppression of the normal state at magnetic fields higher than @xmath36 = 2@xmath39/__g__@xmath40 ( clogston limit @xcite ) , where @xmath39 , _ g _ and @xmath40 stand for the superconducting gap , the gyromagnetic ratio of a free electron , and the bohr magneton , respectively @xcite .",
