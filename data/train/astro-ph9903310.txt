    "the hypothesis that the planets in the solar system were formed in a flattened differentially rotating gaseous disk was originally proposed by kant ( 1755 ) and laplace ( 1796 ) . since then",
    ", the presence of disks around low  mass young stellar objects has been inferred from their infrared excess ( adams , lada  & shu 1987 ) .",
    "recently they have also been imaged directly with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( mccaughrean  & odell 1996 ; burrows et al . 1996 ; mccaughrean et al .",
    "1998 ; krist et al .",
    "1998 ; stapelfeldt et al .",
    "surveys in the orion nebula ( stauffer et al .",
    "1994 ) and the taurus  auriga dark clouds ( beckwith et al . 1990 ) indicate that these disks are common , apparently surrounding between 25 and 75% of the young stellar objects .",
    "their infrared emission may be produced by the gravitational potential energy liberated by matter flowing inwards at a rate @xmath5  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7 ( hartmann et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the nonobservation of disks around older t  tauri stars together with these values of @xmath8 suggest a disk lifetime of between @xmath9 and @xmath10  yr ( strom , edwards & skrutskie 1993 ) .",
    "masses between @xmath11 and @xmath12  m@xmath13 and dimensions in the range 10100  au have been estimated ( beckwith  & sargent 1996 ) .",
    "most theoretical protostellar disk models have relied on the @xmath3parametrization proposed by shakura  & sunyaev ( 1973 ) . in this context , the disk anomalous turbulent viscosity , which enables angular momentum to be transported outwards and therefore matter to flow inwards and be ultimately accreted by the central star , is assumed to give rise to a stress tensor which is simply proportional to the gas pressure .",
    "so far , only mhd instabilities ( balbus  & hawley 1991 ) have been shown to be able to produce and sustain turbulence in accretion disks , and they do lead to an @xmath3type disk ( balbus  & hawley 1998 ) . however , because these instabilities develop only in an adequately ionized fluid , they may not operate everywhere in protostellar disks ( gammie 1996 ) .",
    "therefore it is likely that the parameter @xmath3 , to which the viscosity is simply related , is not constant through these disks .",
    "it may even be that only parts of these disks can be described using this @xmath3 prescription for the viscosity .",
    "however , we may still learn about disks from these models in the same way as we learned about stars from simple polytropic models . therefore , for the purpose of considering planet formation , as we are interested in here , we will use such models .",
    "planets are believed to form out of protostellar disks by either gravitational instability ( kuiper 1951 ; cameron 1978 ; boss 1998 ) or by a process of growth through planetesimal accumulation followed , in the giant planet case , by gas accretion ( safronov 1969 ; wetherill  & stewart 1989 ; perri  & cameron 1974 ; mizuno 1980 ; bodenheimer  & pollack 1986 ) .",
    "the first mechanism is expected to produce preferentially massive objects in the outer parts of the disk , if anything . in this paper",
    "we will study planetary formation within the context of the second mechanism , which is commonly accepted as the most likely process by which planets form in at least the inner ten astronomical units of protostellar disks .",
    "we note however that important issues related to this model still remain to be resolved ( see lissauer 1993 for a review ) .    up to now , planetary formation has been studied at a given location in a disk .",
    "most work has concentrated on orbital distances corresponding to the neighborhood of jupiter .",
    "more recently , prompted by the detection of planets orbiting at short distances from their host star , _ in situ _ formation of giant planets at these locations has also been considered ( ward 1997a ; bodenheimer 1998 ; bodenheimer , hubickyj  & lissauer 1998 ) .    however , the importance of orbital migration as recently indicated by both observations ( see marcy and butler 1998 and references therein ) and theory ( see lin  & papaloizou 1993 and references therein ; ward 1997b ) suggests that planets may not form at a fixed location in the disk , but more likely grow while migrating through the nebula .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate the effect of migration on planetary formation .    in ",
    "[ sec : disk_models ] we construct steady state @xmath3disk models for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "a range of gas accretion rates , @xmath16 , varying between @xmath17 and @xmath18  m@xmath13  yr@xmath7 are considered .",
    "the steady state assumption is reasonable in the inner regions , below 5  au from the central star , where the local viscous timescale is short , typically on the order of @xmath19  yr for @xmath20  m@xmath13  yr@xmath7 .",
    "we present analytic fits for the steady state relation between disk surface density and mass accretion rate as a function of disk location .",
    "these fits can be used to solve the diffusion equation which governs the disk evolution .    in ",
    "[ sec : envelope ] we describe the construction of the protoplanet models based on a solid core with gaseous envelope .",
    "we review the theory of giant planet formation in ",
    "[ sec : background ] and give the equations governing a protoplanet atmosphere in ",
    "[ sec : envelope_eq ] . in   [ sec : envelope_calc ] we give the results of numerical calculations for the critical core mass above which the atmosphere can not remain in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium but must evolve , with the protoplanet entering a rapid gas accretion phase .",
    "these calculations are done at different locations in our disk models . for a given planetesimal accretion rate which supplies the core luminosity necessary to support the envelope , critical core masses",
    "are found to increase significantly by factors of 23 between 5  au and 0.05  au , at which point local conditions may not enable planetesimals to exist .",
    "in   [ sec : migration ] we consider migration of the protoplanetary cores which , according to recent estimates of the effects of tidal interactions with the disk by ward ( 1997b ) , may occur on a timescale between @xmath21  yr and @xmath22  yr for a core mass of several earth masses at 5  au .",
    "this is also comparable to the proposed formation time .",
    "we perform simulations which indicate that such a migrating protoplanet is likely to accrete 24% or more of the planetesimals initially interior to it .",
    "this accretion is likely to maintain the core luminosity such that attainment of the critical mass does not occur until it reaches small radii @xmath23  au where planetesimals no longer exist .    in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss our results in the context of short  period giant planets .",
    "we point out that the processes investigated in this paper are likely to result in a giant planet orbiting at small radii on a timescale significantly shorter than that derived for _ in situ _ formation .",
    "finally in   [ sec : summary ] we summarize our results .",
    "here we consider the equations governing the disk vertical structure in the thin  disk approximation .",
    "using cylindrical coordinates @xmath24 based on the central star and such that the @xmath25 plane corresponds to the disk midplane , we adopt the equation of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium in the form :    @xmath26    together with the energy equation , which states that the rate of energy removal by radiation is locally balanced by the rate of energy production by viscous dissipation :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the radiative flux of energy through a surface of constant @xmath29 which is given by :    @xmath30    here @xmath31 is the mass density per unit volume , @xmath32 is the pressure , @xmath33 is the temperature , @xmath34 is the angular velocity , @xmath35 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath36 is the opacity , which in general depends on both @xmath31 and @xmath33 , and @xmath37 is the stefan  boltzmann constant .",
    "we consider thin disks which are in keplerian rotation around a star of mass @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 , @xmath40 being the gravitational constant . in writing equation  ( [ dtdz ] )",
    ", we have assumed that the disk at the radius considered is optically thick .",
    "however , when the disk is optically thin , i.e. when @xmath41 integrated over the disk thickness is small compared to unity , the temperature gradient given by equation  ( [ dtdz ] ) is small , so that the results we get are consistent in that case also .    to close the system of equations , we relate @xmath32 , @xmath31 and @xmath33 through the equation of state of an ideal gas :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the boltzmann constant",
    ", @xmath44 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath45 is the mass of the hydrogen atom . here",
    "we shall limit our calculations to temperatures lower than 4,000  k , so that , at the densities of interest , hydrogen is in molecular form .",
    "since the main component of protostellar disks is hydrogen , it is a reasonable approximation to take @xmath46 .",
    "tests using a more sophisticated equation of state such as that of chabrier et .",
    "1992 ) indicate only minor differences in the results for the range of temperatures and densities considered .",
    "similarly transport of energy by convection can be neglected here ( see also lin  &  papaloizou  1985 ) .",
    "we adopt the @xmath3parametrization of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , so that the kinematic viscosity is written @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the isothermal sound speed ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "although in general @xmath3 may be a function of both @xmath50 and @xmath29 , we shall limit our calculations presented below to cases with constant @xmath3 ( see discussion in   [ sec : intro ] ) . with this formalism ,",
    "equation  ( [ dfdz1 ] ) becomes :    @xmath51      we have to solve three first order ordinary differential equations for the three variables @xmath28 , @xmath32 ( or equivalently @xmath31 ) , and @xmath33 as a function of @xmath29 at a given radius @xmath50 .",
    "accordingly , we need three boundary conditions at each @xmath50 .",
    "we denote with a subscript @xmath52 values at the disk surface .",
    "a boundary condition is obtained by integrating equation  ( [ dfdz1 ] ) over @xmath29 between @xmath53 and @xmath54 which define the lower and upper boundary of the disk , respectively . since by symmetry",
    "@xmath55 , this gives :    @xmath56    where we have defined @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the disk surface mass density and @xmath59 being the vertically averaged viscosity .",
    "if the disk were in a steady state , @xmath60 would not vary with @xmath50 and would be the constant accretion rate through the disk . in general",
    "however , the disk is not in a steady state ( but see   [ sec : evolution ] ) such that this quantity does depend on @xmath50 and the disk undergoes time dependent evolution .",
    "another boundary condition is obtained by integrating equation  ( [ dpdz ] ) over @xmath29 between @xmath54 and infinity .",
    "a detailed derivation of this condition is presented in appendix  [ appendixa ] .",
    "here we just give the result :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the optical depth above the disk .",
    "this condition is familiar in stellar structure , where @xmath63 would be replaced by the acceleration of gravity at the stellar surface ( e.g. schwarzschild 1958 ) .",
    "since we have defined the disk surface such that the atmosphere above the disk is isothermal , we have to take @xmath64 .",
    "providing this is satisfied , the results do not depend on the value of @xmath62 we choose ( see   [ sec : calcul ] ) .",
    "a third and final boundary condition is given by the expression of the surface temperature ( see appendix  [ appendixa ] for a detailed derivation of this expression ) :    @xmath65    here the disk is assumed immersed in a medium with background temperature @xmath66 .",
    "the surface opacity @xmath67 in general depends on both @xmath68 and @xmath69 and we have used @xmath70 .",
    "the boundary condition  ( [ ts ] ) is the same as that used by levermore & pomraning ( 1981 ) in the eddington approximation ( their eq .",
    "[ 56 ] with @xmath71 ) . in the simple case when @xmath72 and the surface dissipation term involving @xmath3 is set to zero , with @xmath60 being retained , it simply relates the disk surface temperature to the emergent radiation flux .      at a given radius @xmath50 and for a given value of the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath3 , we solve equations  ( [ dpdz ] ) , ( [ dtdz ] ) and  ( [ dfdz ] ) with the boundary conditions  ( [ fs ] ) , ( [ ps ] ) and  ( [ ts ] ) to find the dependence of the state variables on @xmath29 .",
    "the opacity is taken from bell  & lin ( 1994 ) .",
    "this has contributions from dust grains , molecules , atoms and ions .",
    "it is written in the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 vary with temperature .",
    "the equations are integrated using a fifth  order runge ",
    "kutta method with adaptive step length ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) . for a specified @xmath60 and @xmath3",
    ", we first calculate the surface flux @xmath77 and temperature @xmath68 from equations  ( [ fs ] ) and  ( [ ts ] ) , respectively . if @xmath68 is smaller than about 1,000  k , the opacity @xmath67 at the disk surface does not depend on @xmath69 . for larger values of @xmath68",
    ", it turns out that the second term in equation  ( [ ts ] ) , which contains @xmath67 , is negligible compared to the third term .",
    "therefore @xmath68 can always be calculated independently of @xmath69 ( or equivalently @xmath78 ) .",
    "we then determine the value of @xmath79 the vertical height of the disk surface , iteratively .",
    "starting from an estimated value of @xmath79 we calculate @xmath78 and integrate the equations from @xmath54 down to the midplane @xmath25 . the condition that @xmath80 at @xmath25 will not in general be satisfied .",
    "an iteration procedure is then used to adjust the value of @xmath54 until @xmath80 at @xmath25 to a specified accuracy .    an important point to note is that as well as finding the disk structure , we also determine the surface density @xmath81 for a given @xmath82 .",
    "in this way , a relation between @xmath83 and @xmath81 is derived .    in the calculations presented here ,",
    "we have taken @xmath84  m@xmath6 , the optical depth of the atmosphere above the disk surface @xmath85 and a background temperature @xmath86  k. in the optically thick regions of the disk , the value of @xmath54 is independent of the value of @xmath62 we choose . however",
    ", this is not the case in optically thin regions where we find that , as expected , the smaller @xmath87 the larger @xmath54 .",
    "however , this dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath62 has no physical significance , since the surface mass density , the optical thickness through the disk and the midplane temperature hardly vary with @xmath62 .",
    "this is because the mass is concentrated towards the disk midplane in a layer with thickness independent of @xmath88      in general an accretion disk is not in a steady state but undergoes time dependent evolution .",
    "the global evolution of the disk is governed by the well known diffusion equation for the surface density which can be written in the form ( see lynden  bell  & pringle 1974 , papaloizou  & lin 1995 and references therein ) :    @xmath89 \\label{aa4 } .\\ ] ]    the characteristic diffusion time scale at radius @xmath50 is then :    @xmath90    for disks with approximately constant aspect ratio @xmath91 as applies to the models considered here , @xmath92 scales as the local orbital period .",
    "one thus expects that the inner regions relax relatively quickly to a quasi  steady state which adjusts its accretion rate according to the more slowly evolving outer parts ( see lynden  bell  & pringle 1974 and lin  & papaloizou 1985 ) . for estimated sizes of protostellar disks of about 50  au ( beckwith  & sargent 1996 )",
    ", the evolutionary timescale associated with the outer parts is about 30 times longer than that associated with the inner parts with @xmath93  au , which we consider here in the context of planetary formation .",
    "thus these inner regions are expected to be in a quasi  steady state through most of the disk lifetime .",
    "we have verified that this is the case by considering solutions of equation  ( [ aa4 ] ) .    in order to investigate these solutions and for other purposes we found it convenient to utilize analytic piece  wise power law fits to the @xmath83@xmath81 relation derived above ( see   [ sec : calcul ] ) .",
    "details of these fits are given in appendix  [ appendixb ] .",
    "in figures  [ fig1]a  b we plot both the curves @xmath94 obtained from the vertical structure integrations and those obtained from the piece  wise power law fits .",
    "figures  [ fig1]a and  [ fig1]b are for @xmath14 and @xmath95 , respectively . in each case",
    "the radius varies between 0.01 and 100  au , and the calculations are limited to temperatures lower than 4,000  k ( see   [ sec : equations ] ) .",
    "the average errors are 18% and 13% for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "thus the fits give an adequate approximation .",
    "here , we present solutions corresponding to steady state accretion disks . in figures  [ fig1car]a  c and  [ fig2]a  c , we plot @xmath98 , @xmath81 and the midplane temperature @xmath99 versus @xmath50 for @xmath60 between @xmath18 and @xmath17  m@xmath13  yr@xmath7 ( assuming this quantity is the same at all radii , i.e. the disk is in a steady state ) for @xmath14 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "an inspection of figures  [ fig1car]a and  [ fig2]a indicates that the outer parts of the disk are shielded from the radiation of the central star by the inner parts , apart possibly from the very outer parts , which are optically thin anyway and therefore do not reprocess any radiation .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of lin  & papaloizou ( 1980 ) and bell et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . for @xmath95 , the radius beyond which the disk is not illuminated by the central star varies from 0.2  au to about 3  au when @xmath60 goes from @xmath18 to @xmath17  m@xmath13  yr@xmath7 .",
    "these values of the radius move to 0.1 and 2  au when @xmath14 .",
    "since reprocessing of the stellar radiation by the disk is not an important heating factor below these radii , this process will in general not be important in these models of protostellar disks .",
    "we note that this result is independent of the value of @xmath62 we have taken .",
    "indeed , as we pointed out above , only the thickness of the optically thin parts of the disk gets larger when @xmath62 is decreased .    however , there are some indications that disks such as hh30 may be flared ( burrows et al",
    ". 1996 ) . in this context ,",
    "chiang  & goldreich ( 1997 ) have considered a model based on reprocessing in which the dust and gas are at different temperatures .",
    "however , as they pointed out , some issues regarding this model remain to be resolved . in any case",
    ", it is possible that a multiplicity of solutions exists when reprocessing is taken into account , with it being important for cases in which the disk is flared and unimportant when it is not , such as maybe hk  tau ( stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 , koresko 1998 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath98 , @xmath81 and @xmath99 we get are similar to those obtained by lin  & papaloizou ( 1980 ) , who adopted a prescription for viscosity based on convection , and bell et al .",
    "since @xmath54 is measured from the disk midplane to the surface such that @xmath62 is small , it is larger than what would be obtained if a value of 2/3 were adopted for @xmath62 , as is usually the case .",
    "however , this does not affect other physical quantities .",
    "we also recall that @xmath79 as defined here , is about 23 times larger than @xmath100 with @xmath48 being the midplane sound speed , which is commonly used to define the disk semithickness .    in this paper we shall consider the migration of protoplanetary cores from @xmath1015  au , where they are supposed to form under conditions where ice exists , down to the disk inner radii ( see   [ sec : migration ] ) .",
    "it is therefore of interest to estimate the mass of planetesimals contained inside the orbit of a core when it forms , since this can potentially be accreted by the core during its migration . from figures  [ fig1car]b and  [ fig2]b",
    ", we estimate the mass of planetesimals @xmath102 contained within a radius @xmath50 using @xmath103 for @xmath104  au and @xmath105  au . here",
    "we have assumed a gas to dust ratio of 100 .",
    "the values of @xmath106 corresponding to @xmath14 and @xmath11 and @xmath107 and @xmath108  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7 are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we have checked that the disk with @xmath95 and @xmath109  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7 , although relatively massive , is gravitationally stable locally .",
    "namely the toomre parameter @xmath110 with @xmath111 , is larger than unity .",
    "it is also of interest , in relation to the possibility of giant planets being located at small radii , to estimate the mass of gas contained within a radius of 0.1  au .",
    "figure  [ fig2]b indicates that , when @xmath96 , this mass is about 0.3 jupiter mass for @xmath112  m@xmath13  yr@xmath7 . for @xmath113 , there is a similar mass of gas for @xmath114  m@xmath13  yr@xmath7 ( see figure  [ fig1car]b ) . for typical mass throughput of",
    "about @xmath97@xmath12  m@xmath115 the lifetime of such a state can range between @xmath19 and @xmath9  yr . supposing the disk to be terminated at some small inner radius , this suggests that , if a suitable core can migrate there , it could accrete enough gas to become a giant planet within the disk lifetime .",
    "we note however that the conditions for that to happen are marginal even in the early stages of the life of the disk when @xmath116  m@xmath13  yr@xmath117    at later stages , when @xmath118  m@xmath13  yr@xmath119 the models resemble conditions expected to apply to the minimum mass solar nebula with @xmath120  g  @xmath121 at 5  au if @xmath14 . under these conditions",
    ", the mass of gas at @xmath122  au is between 1 and 9  m@xmath1 for @xmath3 between @xmath97 and @xmath11 .",
    "lin et al . ( 1996 ) suppose that the inner disk is terminated by a magnetospheric cavity . in this case migration might be supposed to cease if the core is sufficiently far inside it .",
    "but gas accretion is likely to be very much reduced in this case .",
    "however , the protoplanet may be able to accrete more gas than the mass estimated above if circumstances were such that the core migration is halted at some small radius before the disk is terminated .",
    "we note that ward ( 1986 ) finds the direction of type  i migration is insensitive to the disk surface density profile but that it could reverse from inwards to outwards if the disk midplane temperature decreased inwards faster than approximately linearly .",
    "such a condition would not be expected in the disk models considered here .    on the other hand",
    ", conditions may be very different if interaction with a stellar magnetic field becomes important .",
    "it is expected that this happens when magnetic and viscous torques become comparable ( e.g. ghosh & lamb 1979 ) . in this region",
    "there may be open field lines connected to the disk with an outflowing wind ( paatz & camenzind 1996 ) .",
    "such a wind may provide an additional angular momentum and energy loss mechanism for the disk material ( papaloizou & lin 1995 ) . the inner regions could then be cooler than expected from the constant @xmath3 models considered here leading to a reversal of type  i migration .",
    "a faster gas inflow rate may also prevent the onset of type  ii migration .",
    "thus , although details are unclear , continued accretion of inflowing disk gas by a protoplanetary core that has stopped migrating in the inner disk may be possible .",
    "the solid cores of giant planets are believed to be formed via solid body accretion of km ",
    "sized planetesimals , which themselves are produced as a result of the sedimentation and collisional growth of dust grains in the protoplanetary disk ( see lissauer 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "once the solid core becomes massive enough to gravitationally bind the gas in which it is embedded ( typically at a tenth of an earth mass ) , a gaseous envelope begins to form around the core .",
    "the build  up of the atmosphere has first been considered in the context of the so  called core instability model by perri  & cameron ( 1974 ) and mizuno ( 1980 ; see also stevenson 1982 and wuchterl 1995 ) . in this model ,",
    "the solid core grows in mass along with the atmosphere in quasi  static and thermal equilibrium until the core reaches the so  called critical core mass above which no equilibrium solution can be found for the atmosphere . as long as the core mass is smaller than the critical core mass ,",
    "the energy radiated from the envelope into the surrounding nebula is compensated for by the gravitational energy which the planetesimals entering the atmosphere release when they collide with the surface of the core . during this phase of the evolution ,",
    "both the core and the atmosphere grow in mass relatively slowly . by the time the core mass reaches the critical core mass , the atmosphere has grown massive enough so that its energy losses can no longer be compensated for by the accretion of planetesimals alone . at that point",
    "the envelope has to contract gravitationally to supply more energy .",
    "this is a runaway process , leading to the very rapid accretion of gas onto the protoplanet and to the formation of giant planets such as jupiter . in earlier studies",
    "it was assumed that this rapid evolution was a dynamical collapse , hence the designation core instability for this model .    further time ",
    "dependent numerical calculations of protoplanetary evolution by bodenheimer  & pollack ( 1986 ) support this model , although they show that the core mass beyond which runaway gas accretion occurs , which is referred to as the crossover mass , is slightly larger than the critical core mass , and that the very rapid gravitational contraction of the envelope is not a dynamical collapse .",
    "the designation crossover mass comes from the fact that rapid contraction of the atmosphere occurs when the mass of the atmosphere is comparable to that of the core .",
    "once the crossover mass is reached , the core no longer grows significantly .",
    "more recent simulations by pollack et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that the evolution of a protoplanet is governed by three distinct phases . during phase  1 ,",
    "runaway planetesimal accretion occurs which leads to the depletion of the feeding zone of the protoplanet . at this point , when phase  2 begins ,",
    "the atmosphere is massive enough that the location of its outer boundary is determined by both the mass of gas and planetesimals .",
    "as more gas is accreted , this outer radius moves out , so that the feeding zone is increased and more planetesimals can be captured , which in turn enables more gas to enter the atmosphere .",
    "the protoplanet grows in this way until the core reaches the crossover mass , at which point runaway gas accretion occurs and phase  3 begins .",
    "the timescale for planet formation is determined almost entirely by phase  2 , and is found to be a few million years at 5  au . for typical disk models , this is comparable to the disk lifetime .",
    "note however that isolation of the protoplanetary core , as it occurs at the end of phase  1 , may be prevented under some circumstances by tidal interaction with the surrounding gaseous disk ( ward  & hahn 1995 ) .",
    "conditions appropriate to jupiter s present orbital radius are normally considered and then the critical or crossover mass is found to be around 15  m@xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with models of jupiter which indicate that it has a solid core of about 515  m@xmath1 ( podolak et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "we note that although phase  3 is relatively rapid compared to phase  2 for conditions appropriate to jupiter s present location , it may become longer when the luminosity provided by the accretion of planetesimals , and hence the critical core mass , is reduced ( see pollack et al .",
    "1996 and   [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "the designation runaway or rapid gas accretion may then become confusing .",
    "the similarity between the critical and crossover masses is due to the fact that , although there is some liberation of gravitational energy as the atmosphere grows in mass together with the core , the effect is small as long as the atmospheric mass is small compared to that of the core .",
    "consequently the hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium approximation for the atmosphere is a good one for core masses smaller than the critical value .",
    "therefore we use this approximation here and investigate how the critical core mass varies with location and physical conditions in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "let @xmath123 be the spherical polar radius in a frame with origin at the center of the protoplanet s core .",
    "we assume that we can model the protoplanet as a spherically symmetric nonrotating object .",
    "we also assume that it is in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium .",
    "the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is then :    @xmath124    where @xmath125 is the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath126 being the mass contained in the sphere of radius @xmath123 ( this includes the core mass if @xmath123 is larger than the core radius ) .",
    "we also have the definition of density :    @xmath127    at the high densities that occur at the base of a protoplanetary envelope , the gas can not be considered to be ideal .",

    "we plot curves of total protoplanet mass @xmath163 against core mass @xmath136 at different radii in a disk with @xmath168 and @xmath169  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7 . in each frame",
    ", the different curves correspond to planetesimal accretion rates in the range @xmath170@xmath17  m@xmath1  yr@xmath7 .",
    "the critical core mass is attained at the point where the curves start to loop backwards .",
    "when the core first begins to gravitationally bind some gas , the protoplanet is on the left on the lower branch of these curves .",
    "assuming @xmath138 to be constant , as the core and the atmosphere grow in mass , the protoplanet moves along the lower branch up to the right , until the core reaches @xmath2 .",
    "at that point the hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium approximation can no longer be used for the atmosphere , which begins to undergo very rapid contraction .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] indicates that when the core mass reaches @xmath2 , the mass of the atmosphere is comparable to that of the core , in agreement with bodenheimer  & pollack ( 1986 ) .",
    "since the atmosphere in complete equilibrium is supported by the energy released by the planetesimals accreted onto the protoplanet , we expect the critical core mass to decrease as @xmath138 is reduced .",
    "this is indeed what we observe in figure  [ fig4 ] .    for @xmath14 and @xmath20  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7 , the critical core mass at 5  au varies between 16.2 and 1  m@xmath1 as the planetesimal accretion rate varies between the largest and smallest value .",
    "the former result is in good agreement with that of bodenheimer  & pollack ( 1986 ) .",
    "note that there is a tendency for the critical core masses to increase as the radial location moves inwards , the effect being most marked at small radii . at 1  au , the critical mass varies from 17.5 to 3  m@xmath1 as the accretion rate varies between the largest and smallest value , while at 0.05  au these values increase still further to 42 and 9  m@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we note there has been some debate over the amount of grain opacity which should be used in these calculations .",
    "however , the results of bodenheimer  & pollack ( 1986 ) indicate that @xmath2 does not depend sensitively on the grain opacity in the envelope .",
    "in figure  [ fig5 ] we plot the critical core mass @xmath2 versus the location @xmath50 for three different steady disk models .",
    "these models have @xmath14 and @xmath171  m@xmath13  yr@xmath7 , @xmath14 and @xmath172  m@xmath13  yr@xmath7 , and @xmath95 and @xmath172  m@xmath13  yr@xmath7 , respectively . here",
    "again , in each frame , the different curves correspond to planetesimal accretion rates in the range @xmath170@xmath17  m@xmath1  yr@xmath7 .",
    "similar qualitative behavior is found for the three disk models , but the critical core masses are smaller for the models with @xmath173  m@xmath13  yr@xmath7 , being reduced to 27 and 6  m@xmath1 at 0.05  au for the highest and lowest accretion rate , respectively .",
    "these results indicate a relatively weak dependence on disk conditions except when rather high midplane temperatures @xmath174  k are attained , as in the inner regions .",
    "we indeed find similar values of @xmath2 for the three different models at radii larger than about 0.150.5  au , where @xmath99 is lower than 1,000  k. also , the fact that @xmath2 is similar for the two models with @xmath173  m@xmath13  yr@xmath7 indicates that @xmath2 is more sensitive to the midplane temperature than to the midplane pressure .",
    "these two models have indeed similar @xmath99 , whereas @xmath160 varies significantly from one model to the other .",
    "in the model with @xmath175  m@xmath13  yr@xmath7 , @xmath99 is significantly larger , hence the larger @xmath2 at small radii in this case .",
    "these results are consistent with the fact that @xmath2 depends on the boundary conditions only when a significant part of the envelope is convective ( wuchterl 1993 ) , being larger for larger convective envelopes ( perri  & cameron 1974 ) . in the model with @xmath14 and @xmath20  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7 , we indeed find that the inner 70% in radius of the envelope is convective at 0.05  au , this value being reduced to 10% at 5  au .",
    "when the envelope is mainly radiative , it converges rapidly to the radiative zero solution independently of its outer boundary conditions , so that @xmath2 hardly depends on the background temperature and pressure ( mizuno 1980 ) .",
    "we note that it is unlikely there are planetesimals at the smallest radii considered here .",
    "therefore , although critical core masses for the same planetesimal accretion rates may be higher there , a lack of planetesimals may result in a fall in the core luminosity , making the critical core mass relatively small at these radii .",
    "according to current models of planet formation ( safronov 1969 ; wetherill  & stewart 1989 ) , planetesimals form as the result of the coagulation of dust grains .",
    "further accumulation through binary collisions then results in the formation of a core of several earth masses .",
    "after the critical mass is attained , runaway gas accretion may begin ( see   [ sec : background ] ) .",
    "the core may form on a timescale of about @xmath176  yr at a distance of about 5  au as a result of runaway planetesimals accretion ( lissauer  & stewart 1993 ) .",
    "in addition , dynamical tidal interaction of a core of several earth masses with the surrounding disk matter becomes important , leading to phenomena such as inward orbital migration and gap formation ( lin  & papaloizou 1979a ; goldreich  & tremaine 1980 ; lin  & papaloizou 1993 ; korycansky & pollack 1993 ; ward 1997b ) . for conditions under which the tidal interaction with the disk is linear , ward ( 1986 , 1997b ) estimates inward migration ( referred to as type  i ) timescales @xmath177 of about @xmath178  yr at 5  au in a protoplanetary disk similar to the minimum mass solar nebula .",
    "the timescales at other radii are expected to roughly scale as @xmath179 for the model disks considered here .",
    "they are also somewhat shorter during the early phases of disk evolution when the disk is more massive .",
    "however , for core masses of the magnitude we consider , the interaction may become nonlinear , leading to a reduction in the inward migration ( then referred to as type  ii ) rate . to investigate the conditions for nonlinearity , korycansky  & papaloizou ( 1996 ) considered the perturbed disk flow around an embedded protoplanet assuming the disk viscosity to be negligible .",
    "they used a shearing ",
    "sheet approximation in which a patch , centered on the planet and corotating with its orbit , is considered in a 2d approximation .",
    "they found that the condition for nonlinearity or the formation of significant trailing shock waves in the response is that @xmath180 where @xmath181 is a multiple of the roche lobe radius .",
    "this condition effectively compares the strength of the protoplanet s gravity to local pressure forces . for the disk models considered here",
    ", this condition is met for @xmath182  m@xmath1 for all disk mass accretion rates @xmath16 at the inner radii .",
    "even for @xmath183  m@xmath1 , it is met at 0.1  au for the higher accretion rates .",
    "thus if we wish to consider core mass migration , nonlinear effects must be considered .",
    "these are expected to lead to a feedback reaction from the disk which couples the orbital migration to the viscous evolution of the disk ( lin  & papaloizou 1986 ) .",
    "however , this timescale can also be quite short , particularly for the models with higher accretion rates .",
    "for example ,",
    "when @xmath96 and @xmath184  m@xmath13  yr@xmath119 the viscous inflow timescale is on the order of @xmath185  yr at 5  au .",
    "the characteristic timescale of @xmath186  yr obtained for migration and estimated for core formation suggests that cores of several earth masses form at about 5  au and migrate inwards to small radii . in doing so",
    ", they continue to grow . as long as significant planetesimal accretion onto the core",
    "is maintained during the migration , the critical core mass @xmath2 remains significant and may not be attained before the core reaches small radii . at small radii ,",
    "typically smaller than 0.1  au , the planetesimal accretion rate decreases because the high temperatures have prevented the formation of planetesimals there .",
    "the critical core mass is then also reduced below the actual core mass , so that runaway gas accretion can begin .",
    "note though that the gas accretion phase may become longer than the disk lifetime if the mass of the core is too small ( see   [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "however , the build  up of a core massive enough through the merger of additional incoming cores may enable giant planets to form within the disk lifetime provided there is enough gas to supply the atmosphere .",
    "the accretion rate onto a protoplanet migrating in an approximately circular orbit through a planetesimal swarm with surface density @xmath187 can be estimated as :    @xmath188    here we use a simple two dimensional model appropriate for a thin planetesimal disk from which accretion occurs onto a large protoplanet .",
    "the impact target radius of the protoplanet is @xmath75 and @xmath189 is the relative velocity in collisions .",
    "we consider the case of near circular orbits .",
    "then the relative velocity associated with a collision is expected to be equivalent to the keplerian shear across the roche lobe radius .",
    "thus we adopt @xmath190 as characteristic induced relative velocity . the factor @xmath191 takes account of other effects such as gravitational focusing , which tends to increase the collision rate , and any local reduction in @xmath187 , which would be expected to occur",
    "if planetesimals are depleted locally and a gap tends to form ( tanaka & ida 1997 ) .",
    "this might be expected for very slow migration rates but the total amount of accretion would be expected to be large in that case .",
    "we take @xmath192 as characteristic effective size of the protoplanet core , this representing the actual physical size of a core with density 3.2  g  @xmath151 at 0.75  au . at smaller radii",
    "this is larger while at larger radii it is smaller .    in this context",
    "we note that there is some uncertainty in the size of the target radius to be used because there may be a disk of bound planetesimals .",
    "further , numerical tests indicate that the results we present below are not very sensitive to the magnitude of the target radius used because of the effects of gravitational focusing .",
    "this is also supported by the results of kary , lissauer & grenzweig ( 1993 ) .",
    "they considered the accretion of small planetesimals migrating inwards under the influence of gas drag by a protoplanet in fixed circular orbit ( see below ) .",
    "their results indicate that , for weak gas drag , which is appropriate for no resonant trapping , the impact probability typically differs from that assuming a target radius @xmath192 by no more than a factor of about three as @xmath75 varies between @xmath193 and @xmath194 we comment that if the target radius was 6 times the actual core size , all accretion rates derived here would be underestimates for migration occurring with @xmath93  au .    thus for a simple estimate we use :    @xmath195    we can estimate the total fraction of the total planetesimal mass accreted in a migration time @xmath196 to be :    @xmath197    characteristically , we find this fraction to be about 0.1 for @xmath198 @xmath199  m@xmath1 and @xmath200 , which are the expected characteristic values according to ward ( 1997b ) .",
    "the expected fraction scales only weakly with protoplanet mass , being proportional to @xmath201 .",
    "but note too that the above may underestimate the accretion rate because larger relative velocities may be induced if there are multiple close scatterings .",
    "it is of interest to compare the accretion rate expected from the above two dimensional model with predictions based on the standard accretion formula with gravitational focusing for three dimensions ( lissauer & stewart 1993 ) .",
    "this gives :    @xmath202    where @xmath203 is the semithickness of the planetesimal distribution . using the same estimate for @xmath189 as above ,",
    "this gives ( assuming the dominance of the second gravitational focusing term in the brackets ) :    @xmath204    for the same parameters as used above this gives the same prediction as equation  ( [ accrt ] ) with @xmath205 both these expressions and our simulations give consistent results suggesting that the migrating protoplanet accretes as if it were in a homogeneous medium without a gap forming in the planetesimal distribution .",
    "whether such a gap forms should be reliably determined by the two dimensional calculations .    given that the disk is expected to contain at least about 8  m@xmath1 within 5  au in the early stages ( see   [ sec : steady ] and table  [ tab1 ] ) , these estimates indicate that an accretion rate @xmath138 of at least about @xmath17  m@xmath1  yr@xmath7 is likely to be maintained during orbital migration in the present disk models .",
    "efficient gas accretion is then unlikely to start until small radii are reached , at least in the early phases of the disk lifetime .",
    "note too that the fractional accretion rate given by equation  ( [ migration ] ) is not expected to increase indefinitely with @xmath196 because of the tendency to form a gap ( tanaka & ida 1997 ) which would then be expected to cause a reduction in @xmath206    in order to verify the above conclusions , we have performed simulations of migrating protoplanets with @xmath182  m@xmath1 and migration times , @xmath207 measured at 1  au , of between @xmath208  yr and @xmath19  yr .",
    "we have also considered the case @xmath183",
    "m@xmath1 and @xmath196 between @xmath209  yr and @xmath176  yr . the protoplanet was taken to be in a quasi  circular orbit with @xmath210 decreasing on the specified timescale .",
    "the protoplanet was assumed to start at 1  au but the results can be scaled to any other initial radius in the usual way .",
    "the 256 planetesimals were initially regularly spaced between 0.6  au and 0.8  au , as indicated in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the protoplanet was allowed to migrate through them . to estimate the fraction of planetesimals accreted , just as above",
    ", we assumed that any particle approaching the protoplanet within 0.01  @xmath155 was accreted .",
    "we remark that the migration was imposed here , being possibly due to interactions with the disk .",
    "however , a migration mechanism based on the scattering of planetesimals alone has been noted by murray et al .",
    "their mechanism requires the protoplanet orbit to have a non zero eccentricity , but this could be damped by the disk interaction ( artymowicz  1994 ) .    for the protoplanet masses and migration rates we consider , we found significant accretion of planetesimals .",
    "we here present two examples .",
    "the final distribution of the planetesimals after a protoplanet of 1  m@xmath1 has migrated through them with @xmath211  yr is indicated in figure  [ fig7 ] . in this case , about 24% of the planetesimals initially present were accreted .",
    "even more planetesimals were accreted with slower migration rates .",
    "the final distribution of the planetesimals after a protoplanet of 10  m@xmath1 has migrated through them with @xmath212  yr is given in figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "in this case , about 23% of the planetesimals initially present were accreted .",
    "given that the disk models typically contain at least about 8  m@xmath1 interior to 5  au , we conclude that enough accretion occurs during the migration to prevent gas accretion as long as planetesimals are present .",
    "it is of interest to compare the results of our simulations with those of kary et al .",
    "these authors considered the accretion of small bodies migrating inwards under the influence of gas drag onto a protoplanet in fixed circular orbit .",
    "although this is not an identical situation to the one we consider here , it is similar enough to make a comparison interesting .",
    "an important aspect of these simulations is that gas drag causes eccentricity damping as well as inward migration .",
    "the eccentricity damping allows particles to be trapped in resonances such that they stop migrating , maintaining near circular orbits , with the consequence that close approaches to the protoplanet are avoided .",
    "the resonant interaction causes eccentricity growth at a rate governed by the migration rate .",
    "this is because energy and angular momentum transfer from the protoplanet is in the wrong ratio for keeping the other body in circular orbit . without eccentricity damping , near circular orbits for the particles",
    "could not be maintained ( see , for example , lin & papaloizou 1979b for a discussion ) .",
    "to relate the migration and damping rates , we consider a particle with semi  major axis @xmath213 and eccentricity @xmath214 undergoing resonant interaction with a protoplanet in a near circular orbit with semi ",
    "major axis @xmath215 under these conditions , the jacobi integral :    @xmath216,\\ ] ]    is conserved for the particle .",
    "thus , changes to @xmath217 and @xmath214 are related by :    @xmath218 \\sqrt{1-e^2 } { 1\\over a_p}{d a_p\\over dt}. \\label{jacobi}\\ ] ]    when an inwardly migrating protoplanet pushes an interior particle in front of it maintaining a fixed period ratio , just as for the protoplanet , @xmath219 then equation  ( [ jacobi ] ) implies that the eccentricity increases . if the orbit is to maintain a finite eccentricity , this rate of increase has to be balanced by the the eccentricity damping or circularization rate due to dissipative processes such as gas drag",
    ". if the circularization time is @xmath220 an equilibrium eccentricity can be maintained , such that for small @xmath214 :    @xmath221    equation  ( [ ecc ] ) also applies to the case of a fixed protoplanet orbit and particles migrating inwards due to gas drag . in that case @xmath222 and the resonant interaction gives positive rates of increase for both @xmath213 and @xmath223 these are balanced by the inward migration rate due to gas drag and the orbital circularization rate respectively .    the process of resonant trapping is accordingly expected to be similar in the cases of a free particle with inward migrating protoplanet and particle migrating inwards towards a protoplanet on fixed circular orbit .",
    "but it is important to note that the physical processes causing migration and circularization may both be very different .",
    "an interpolation of the results of kary et al .",
    "( 1993 ) indicates that resonant trapping is important for @xmath224  yr for a 1  m@xmath1 protoplanet at 1  au , and @xmath225  yr for a 10  m@xmath1 protoplanet at 1  au .",
    "these migration times are longer than those proposed by ward ( 1997b ) , or the disk viscous timescale at 15  au in the early stages of the protoplanetary disk considered here .",
    "the expectation is that resonant trapping will not be important then .    when there is no resonant trapping , the fraction of bodies accreted is similar to that found here , ranging between 10 and 40 percent .",
    "we comment that the high rate of eccentricity damping required for effective resonant trapping is only likely to be obtained for small bodies . from kary et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , when marginal trapping occurs for a 10  m@xmath1 protoplanet approached by small bodies with @xmath226  yr , @xmath227  yr at 1  au .",
    "as @xmath228 is proportional to the radius of the body , values less than 30  yr require the radius of the body to be smaller than 20  m at 1  au .",
    "but note that the relative effectiveness of gas drag tends to increase at smaller radii .",
    "thus resonant trapping , should it occur , is more likely in the inner regions of the disk .",
    "equation  ( [ ecc ] ) suggests that @xmath196 and @xmath228 should scale together for marginal resonant trapping occurring with the same orbital configuration .",
    "thus a 10  m@xmath1 protoplanet at 1  au migrating inwards with @xmath229  yr should resonantly trap bodies , causing them also to migrate inwards maintaining a fixed period ratio , if @xmath230  yr .",
    "we have verified that trapping occurs when @xmath231  yr .",
    "however , it appears that resonant trapping as a result of gas drag is unlikely for planetesimals with radii larger than about 10  km and the accretion rates should then be similar to those found here .",
    "departures are to be expected only for small bodies at the slowest migration rates .",
    "the above suggests that a protoplanetary core formed at about 5  au which migrates inwards will not attain the critical core mass , above which runaway gas accretion starts , before it reaches small radii @xmath2320.1  au where planetesimals no longer exist .",
    "runaway gas accretion onto a small core can then occur at these radii .",
    "however , if the core is too small , the gas accretion phase may be longer than the disk lifetime .    even for core masses in the range 1520  m@xmath1 ,",
    "the build  up of a massive atmosphere may take a time @xmath233  yr ( bodenheimer et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that once the core starts to accrete a significant atmosphere , energy production occurs through its gravitational contraction .",
    "the luminosity produced then slows down the evolution .",
    "an estimate of the evolutionary timescale at this stage can be obtained by noting that the luminosity should be equivalent to that required to make the core critical ( and hence to enable runaway gas accretion to begin ) , assuming it to be produced by planetesimal accretion .",
    "we may thus estimate the time scale as the kelvin ",
    "helmholtz time for our already calculated critical core mass models .",
    "this is given by :    @xmath234    where @xmath235 is the total internal and gravitational energy of the gas .",
    "we have calculated @xmath236 in this way for critical cores at different radial locations in a disk model with @xmath237 and @xmath238  m@xmath13  yr@xmath7 .",

    "the core masses required to get such a characteristic timescale increase rapidly interior to 0.06  au .",
    "however , we note that they decrease as the mass transfer rate through the disk does .",
    "the fact that fairly large core masses are required to give evolutionary timescales comparable or less than the expected disk lifetime means that mergers of additional incoming cores may be required in order to produce a core of sufficient mass that real runaway gas accretion may begin .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] indicates that , in a disk with @xmath95 and @xmath240 or @xmath108  m@xmath13  yr@xmath7 , 40  m@xmath1 of planetesimals are contained within 1 or 5  au .",
    "therefore , the timescale for building  up a core with a mass between 20 and 40  m@xmath1 at small radii is typically the timescale it takes for planetesimals to migrate from 1 or 5  au down to these small radii . according to ward ( 1997b ) ,",
    "the migration timescale of cores of a few tenths of an earth mass located at 1 or 5  au is at most @xmath9  yr in such a disk , and it decreases with increasing core mass .",
    "therefore , if planetesimals can be assembled into cores of at least a few tenths of an earth mass at these radii on a reasonably short timescale , a massive core could be obtained at small radii on a timescale much shorter than for _ in situ _ formation .    if the disk has @xmath14 , 40  m@xmath1 of planetesimals are contained within 5 or 11  au . in this case",
    "again , the migration timescale of cores of a few tenths of an earth mass located at 5 or 11  au is about @xmath9  yr , so that the above discussion still holds .",
    "a massive core can be built  up through the merger of additional incoming cores either after having stopped at small radii or on its way down to small radii ( where it would still be expected to be stopped ) .",
    "the former process resembles that discussed by ward ( 1997a ) .",
    "the latter scenario would occur if more massive cores , which migrate faster , overtake less massive cores on their way down .",
    "supposing that a protoplanetary core massive enough can be built  up on its way down to small radii and that it continues to rapidly move inward until it gets interior to the disk inner boundary , it can only accrete the gas which is in its vicinity , i.e. typically the amount of gas contained within @xmath2320.1  au .",
    "since the core is expected to reach these radii early in the life of the protoplanetary disk , there may still be an adequate amount of gas there ( see   [ sec : steady ] ) for it to build  up a large envelope and become a giant planet .",
    "however the conditions for that to happen are rather marginal .",
    "if the protoplanetary core is stopped at some small radius before the disk is terminated , it might be able to retain contact with disk gas . in that case",
    "it might be able to accrete enough gas supplied from the outer disk by viscous evolution to build  up a massive atmosphere .",
    "the question arises as to the nature of any process that can halt the migration .",
    "one might suppose that because the viscous evolution timescale of the disk increases as the disk gets older , protoplanet migration , if type  ii , gets slower and slower , and may halt altogether when the disk dissipates ( e.g. , trilling et al . 1998 ) . however , given that the migration timescale is shorter at smaller radii , if no mechanism halts it there , very fine tuning would be required to produce the large fraction of extrasolar planets found on very close orbits in this way .",
    "the disk may be terminated by a magnetospheric cavity ( lin et .",
    "al 1996 ) such that tidal torques producing inward migration vanish once the protoplanet enters it . however , as a result of such an entry , contact with the disk is lost and further accretion of gas may be difficult . also magnetospheric cavities may not extend up to a few tenths of an au , where some of the extrasolar planets have been found to orbit .",
    "the way in which the migration of a protoplanet would be halted in the inner regions is not yet clear ( e.g. , bodenheimer et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this context , we remark that migration rates are usually considered in relation to a standard @xmath3 disk model in which the disk midplane temperature increases inwards . in this situation inward migration is expected in general ( ward 1986 ) .",
    "however , if the inner disk is terminated through interaction with a stellar magnetic field , physical conditions may start to differ in the interaction zone where magnetic field lines penetrate the disk .",
    "additional energy and angular momentum transport mechanisms due to a wind for example may start to become important ( see discussion in   [ sec : steady ] ) . as a result , an inward midplane temperature decrease might be produced .",
    "it may then be possible that migration could be halted such that the protoplanet retains contact with disk gas .    in the context of several cores interacting together",
    ", we note that stellar tides are unlikely to provide enough eccentricity damping for resonant trapping to occur for the migration rates we consider .",
    "the circularization time resulting from stellar tides is given by ( goldreich and soter 1966 ) : @xmath241 here @xmath242 denotes the orbital period , @xmath243 the radius of the planet and @xmath244 is the usual tidal @xmath244value . for a @xmath245 earth masses planet orbiting a solar mass at @xmath246",
    "au , one typically finds @xmath247  yr . as @xmath248 this must exceed the migration times considered here , and so resonant trapping is unlikely .",
    "this is because normally @xmath249 is required ( kary et al .",
    "1993 , lin & papaloizou 1979b and see eq .",
    "[ [ ecc ] ] ) .",
    "similar conclusions can be obtained if stellar tides acting on a jovian planet are considered ( lin et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "however , conditions may be different later in the life of the disk when the viscous evolution time is longer and type  ii migration rates are slower . a model of the protostellar disk in which giant planets form at about 5  au at a later stage in the life of the disk after about @xmath250  yr ,",
    "when the viscous time is of comparable magnitude , has been considered by trilling et al .",
    "in this situation the planet is able to open a gap and undergo inward type  ii migration on the viscous timescale .",
    "these authors consider outward torques due to tidal interaction with the central star and roche lobe overflow as well as torques due to disk interaction . assuming disk dispersal on a similar timescale they are able to produce giant planets at a range of orbital radii .",
    "these may then undergo orbital instability , leaving one inner planet and one or several partners at larger radii ( e.g. , weidenschilling & marzari 1996 ; rasio & ford 1996 ) . in this regard , it is of interest to note that the only system detected so far which may be multiple , 55  cnc ( butler et al .",
    "1997 ) , has a planet at 0.11  au and maybe another planet beyond 4  au .",
    "the above scenario thus might be able to produce short period planets in the late stages of the life of the disk .",
    "in contrast , the processes which are the focus of this paper result in the short period planets originating early in the life of the disk . they would more likely result in a single planet at @xmath251  au than at intermediate radii and do not necessarily produce other giant planets at larger radii as a result of gravitational scattering processes . in this respect , the outcome would be in good agreement with the observations to date .      in this paper",
    "we have investigated how the critical core mass associated with a solid protoplanet varies with location in a protoplanetary disk . in the past , work has concentrated on _ in situ _ formation , mainly at orbital distances corresponding to the neighborhood of jupiter .",
    "however , the importance of orbital migration has recently been indicated by both observations ( see marcy  & butler 1998 and references therein ) and theory ( see lin  & papaloizou 1993 and references therein ; ward 1997b ) .",
    "this suggests that the behavior of the critical core mass as a function of location in and mass transfer rate through the protoplanetary disk should be considered .",
    "we constructed steady state protostellar disk models with constant values of @xmath113 and @xmath15 .",
    "a range of accretion rates varying between @xmath252 and @xmath18  m@xmath13  yr@xmath7 were considered .",
    "we calculated analytic piece  wise power law fits to the curves @xmath253 obtained from numerical calculations .",
    "these fits can be used to solve the diffusion equation governing the disk evolution for a wide range of disk parameters .",
    "we constructed protoplanet models with a solid core and a gaseous envelope in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium .",
    "we calculated the critical core mass , @xmath2 , above which the atmosphere can not remain in complete equilibrium but must begin to undergo a very rapid contraction . where they can be compared , these critical core masses agree with the crossover masses obtained from more sophisticated time dependent calculations ( bodenheimer & pollack 1986 , pollack et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "we found that , for a fixed core accretion rate , @xmath2 typically increases by factors of 23 between 5 and 0.05  au for disk parameters believed to be typical of the early stages of the disk evolution ( i.e. @xmath14 and a gas accretion rate @xmath254  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7 ) . for a core accretion rate of @xmath255  m@xmath1  yr@xmath7 ,",
    "the critical core mass is found to be about 16  m@xmath1 at 5  au , in agreement with bodenheimer  & pollack ( 1986 ) , and it decreases with @xmath138 . at radii smaller than about 0.05 - 0.1  au , local conditions may not enable the planetesimals , required to produce the accretion luminosity to support the atmosphere , to exist",
    ". therefore the critical core mass is reduced at these radii .",
    "we considered these results in the context of the migration of protoplanetary cores with mass in the range 110  m@xmath1 .",
    "according to recent estimates of the effects of tidal interactions with the disk ( ward 1997b ) , the migration timescale for such cores may be between @xmath19 and @xmath176  yr at @xmath256  au , being comparable to their proposed formation time . in order to investigate whether the planetesimal accretion would continue under migration , we performed simulations which indicate that a protoplanet migrating at the proposed rate is likely to accrete 24% or more of the planetesimals initially interior to its orbit .",
    "thus accretion is likely to maintain the core luminosity such that attainment of the critical mass does not occur until small radii @xmath23  au are reached , where planetesimals no longer exist .",
    "although runaway gas accretion can then begin onto small mass cores at these small radii , the timescale for building  up a massive envelope becomes longer than the disk lifetime if the core is too small .",
    "however , cores massive enough can be built  up through mergers of additional incoming cores on a timescale shorter than for _ in situ _ formation .",
    "the above considerations can lead to the preferential formation of short  period planets with semi ",
    "major axis less than about 0.1  au , on a timescale shorter than that derived for _ in situ _ planet formation .",

    "we then integrate this equation over @xmath259 between the surface of the disk and infinity , where the pressure is zero .",

    "the temperature gradient in the vertical direction is much larger than that in the horizontal direction , so that @xmath277 . using the expression  ( [ dfdz1 ] ) and the relation between @xmath269 and @xmath66",

    "we obtain the following equation for @xmath68 :    @xmath279",
    "to compute the evolution of a non  steady @xmath3disk , it is necessary to solve the diffusion equation  ( [ aa4 ] ) . to do this",
    ", @xmath280 has to be specified as a function of @xmath81 at each radius .",
    "we found it convenient to have an analytic fit to the curves @xmath281    we utilize fits in which these curves are approximated by three different power laws corresponding respectively to the optically thin , intermediate and optically thick regimes .",
    "the index of these power laws is independent of the radius @xmath50 and the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "however , the multiplicative constant characterizing each of them does vary with both @xmath50 and @xmath3 .",
    "we give this dependence below .",
