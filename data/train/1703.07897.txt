    "cosmic rays were discovered a little over 100 years ago  @xcite .",
    "they were called `` cosmic '' to distinguish them from the then equally mysterious `` x rays '' emanating from laboratory instruments and particular minerals . the increase in intensity of this cosmic radiation with altitude made it clear that the sources were extraterrestrial . over the next few decades , the grand questions were developed about their origin , the extent of the energy spectrum , and their composition .",
    "it took close to one hundred years to find the end of the remarkable , approximately power law energy spectrum , at energies near 50 joules per nucleus .",
    "we now know a great deal more , and at lower energies in significant detail ( as in the isotopic composition and gamma / electron / positron fluxes ) .",
    "but at the `` frontier '' energies of @xmath1ev , where the flux is most likely extra - galactic , the experimental tools , while greatly improved , are still too imprecise .",
    "while our ability to measure energy with reasonable certitude has improved dramatically , we attempt to measure the cosmic ray composition with what is effectively a blunt instrument .",
    "the measurement of arrival directions has also improved markedly , but there , nature has been unkind and only hints of cosmic ray anisotropy and sources have appeared .",
    "one hundred years ago , the argument was whether the radiation came from the earth or space , whether it was composed of charged or neutral particles , and what could be inferred about its energy by measuring `` penetrating power '' .",
    "now the arguments relate to the nature of observed structures in the energy spectrum - the knees , ankles and final cut - off , whether the composition is protonic , a mixture of p , he and cno group nuclei , or significantly heavy up to fe , and how this interplays with the spectral structure .",
    "hints of departure from arrival direction isotropy come and go and we fervently hold on to the most recent observation hoping that this time the significance will strengthen with additional data and a source , or sources , will finally be found . but except for the spectrum and its structures , much of what we argue about is ephemeral and can easily change with modification of hadronic models or a decrease in statistical significance of a source .",
    "it is a hard fact that we still do not know with any real certainty the origin of cosmic rays above a few tens of gev in energy .",
    "what is it then that we do know , how well , and what are the implications ? this is what will be discussed at length in this volume .",
    "our knowledge of our deficiencies also leads to new ideas for better detectors and new programmatic approaches to fill in needed extrapolations from accelerator data and ancillary measurements .",
    "this too will be explored in subsequent pages .    in the present paper",
    "we address broadly the experimental status above @xmath2ev and briefly describe the current status and the evolution of ultra - high energy ( uhe ) detection techniques .",
    "the pioneering volcano ranch , haverah park , sugar , yakutsk and akeno arrays  @xcite led to the major leaps forward represented by the agasa , fly s eye , hires , auger and ta experiments  @xcite .",
    "the early detectors led us to more precise formulations of the questions we now ask .",
    "the decades - long development of these second and third generation detectors culminated in the reliable results with well - understood energy and geometrical resolution that have given us new hope that many of the puzzles presented by uhe cosmic rays may soon be answered .",
    "the current generation of detectors has brought definitive confirmation on hints of an ankle structure above @xmath3ev  @xcite and settled once and for all the reality of a cut - off at energies between 4 and 6 @xmath4 @xmath5ev  @xcite .",
    "the `` holy grail '' of uhe cosmic ray physics has been found .",
    "it is striking that the suppression is in the same range of energy as the prediction of the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect  @xcite ( depending somewhat on the assumed distribution of sources , composition and the injection spectrum ) .",
    "improvements in the determination of extensive air shower ( eas ) profiles and the depth of shower maximum , @xmath6 , brought about by either using stereo air fluorescence measurements ( hires and ta )  @xcite or by hybrid surface detector and air fluorescence measurements ( auger and ta )  @xcite have reduced the reconstruction uncertainties in @xmath6 to near 10g/@xmath7 with systematic uncertainties approaching this number .",
    "we have reached the point where the experimental measurements are becoming more precise than the theoretical underpinnings of the shower simulations used to extract composition information .",
    "while data from the lhc in the forward region at an equivalent energy of @xmath3ev are very helpful in tuning the various hadronic models  @xcite , there are significant issues in extrapolating to p - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus interactions at much higher energies ( @xmath2 - @xmath8ev )  @xcite .",
    "currently the combined systematic uncertainties for data and simulations make it difficult to reliably find the mix of protons , he , cno and fe that would match the observed @xmath6 distributions .",
    "what can be said , and this is a great accomplishment , is that there is very little iron nucleus component  @xcite .",
    "why this should be the case , given the relative stability of the iron nucleus as it travels through the relic photon fields , and its relatively high acceleration efficiency , is a puzzle which we are just now beginning to confront .",
    "at the beginning of the 21st century , three experiments were studying the highest energy cosmic rays : the yakutsk array , the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) , and the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) .",
    "the yakutsk array in russia had operated in various forms since 1967 , and had reached a maximum collecting area of 17km@xmath9 around 1990 .",
    "subsequently , it was reconfigured to study lower energy cosmic rays , and today it has an area of 8km@xmath9 .",
    "while its focus has changed , analyses are still done on the data from high energy showers already collected e.g. @xcite .",
    "agasa , located 100 km west of tokyo at an average altitude of 667 m , operated from 1990 to 2004 as a 100km@xmath9 array consisting of over one hundred scintillator detectors inter - connected by optical fibers for timing measurements and data collection  @xcite .",
    "it pioneered many of the techniques employed today in more modern observatories , and produced important results on the uhecr energy spectrum , anisotropy and mass composition  @xcite .",
    "of particular historical interest was the observation by agasa of the continuation of the cosmic ray spectrum beyond @xmath8ev , with no sign of a flux suppression  @xcite .",
    "hires was the successor to the first successful air fluorescence detector , the fly s eye  @xcite which operated from 1981 to 1993 at the dugway proving grounds in utah , usa . the fly s eye achieved a time - averaged aperture of about 100km@xmath9sr at the highest energies , taking into account that it only operated on clear , moonless nights .",
    "hires was an advancement in resolution and sensitivity , achieved by increasing the telescope effective mirror areas to 3.8m@xmath9 , and reducing the camera pixel angular diameters to @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "two sites , 12.8 km apart , were instrumented , allowing for stereo observations of approximately @xmath11% of air showers that triggered either detector near @xmath5ev .",
    "the collecting area of hires was close to an order of magnitude larger than that of the fly s eye .",
    "the first hires site at five mile hill began full operation in 1997 , followed by the camel s back mountain site in 1999 .",
    "hires ceased operations in 2006 .",
    "a summary of the important physics results from hires is given in  @xcite .",
    "this includes the first unambiguous detection of a flux suppression at the highest energies , using monocular data from hires i and published in 2008  @xcite .    at the beginning of",
    "the 1990s discussions began about the next step in uhe cosmic ray observations , where it was recognised that apertures even larger than that of hires would be necessary to answer some of the long - standing questions in cosmic ray astrophysics .",
    "the experimental challenge was enhanced by the apparent disagreement in the energy spectra presented by agasa and hires in the first few years of the new century .",
    "this led to the next generation of experiments adopting hybrid designs , with combinations of surface arrays and air fluorescence detectors .    .",
    "the tale detector is situated at the md site  @xcite . ]    .",
    "the tale detector is situated at the md site  @xcite . ]",
    "the pierre auger observatory had its beginnings in 1991 when james cronin and alan watson began discussions with a number of experimenters in the field .",
    "its design evolved through an initial meeting in paris in 1992 , a two week design workshop in adelaide in 1993 , and a six - month design study hosted by fermilab in 1995 .",
    "initial ideas were based on a 5000km@xmath9 surface array without fluorescence telescopes , but the advantages of the hybrid approach soon became apparent  @xcite .",
    "the auger observatory is near malarge , argentina , and its construction began in 2001 with an engineering array .",
    "the observatory was completed in 2008 , though official data taking began in 2004 during construction .",
    "auger s surface detector ( sd ) consists of 1660 water - cherenkov detectors ( wcds ) arranged on a 1.5 km triangular grid covering 3000km@xmath9  @xcite , see figure  [ fig : auger ] .",
    "the wcds are 10m@xmath9 in area and 1.2 m deep , and build on the experience gained from the haverah park detector in the uk ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "such detectors have the advantage of having a broad zenith angle sensitivity , and are deep enough to produce signal from the numerous photons in the extensive air shower .",
    "the sd is fully efficient for cosmic ray energies greater than @xmath12ev and zenith angles less than @xmath13 .",
    "a small 23.5km@xmath9 area of the array hosts a denser 750 m spacing of wcds , which is fully efficient for @xmath14ev and zenith angles less than @xmath15 .",
    "the main fluorescence detector ( fd ) consists of 4 sites on the perimeter of the surface array .",
    "each site hosts six telescopes , each with a field of view of @xmath16 in azimuth and an elevation range from @xmath17 to @xmath16 .",
    "each telescope is of the schmidt design and consists of a 13m@xmath9 segmented spherical mirror with a 2.2 m diameter entrance aperture ( including a ring of corrector lenses ) and a camera composed of 440 photomultiplier pixels , each viewing a @xmath17 diameter area of sky  @xcite .",
    "the entrance aperture also contains a uv transmitting filter to match the air fluorescence spectrum spanning approximately 300400 nm .",
    "the telescope design benefits from experience with the fly s eye and hires experiments , with the primary difference being the schmidt optics design , allowing for a wide field of view with minimal coma aberration . apart from the 24 telescopes of the main fd described here , an additional three telescopes make up the heat ( high elevation auger telescopes ) system .",
    "these view the elevation range between @xmath16 and @xmath18 to study lower energy air showers ( currently down to @xmath3ev ) that , due to their lower brightness , are observed closer to the fd site  @xcite .    the combination of the surface and fluorescence detectors to make a `` hybrid '' observatory has been exploited in much of auger s scientific output .",
    "the sd has many strengths , including robust wcds that operate with a 100% duty cycle .",
    "it also measures the lateral characteristics of the air shower , albeit at one altitude , which are being used for several studies including mass composition .",
    "the fd , while having the disadvantage of a 15% duty cycle  @xcite , measures fluorescence light which is produced in direct proportion to the energy deposited by the air shower .",
    "thus , the fluorescence technique measures air shower energies calorimetrically , and it is the fd measurements of energy that calibrate the sd energy scale , as described below . the fd views the developing shower and has access to the depth of shower maximum , @xmath6 , used in mass composition studies .",
    "finally , the fd reconstruction of the direction and position of the air shower axis is greatly assisted by the sd measurement of the shower arrival time at ground level  @xcite .",
    "this hybrid reconstruction produces an fd arrival direction resolution of about @xmath19  @xcite , which helps achieve typical resolutions in energy and @xmath6 of @xmath20% and 20g/@xmath7 , respectively , at @xmath5ev  @xcite .",
    "descriptions of the calibration procedures for both the sd and fd are given in  @xcite .",
    "in both cases the calibration is `` end - to - end '' , either using unaccompanied muons ( in the case of the sd ) or a large `` drum '' to illuminate an fd aperture , so as to calibrate the full detector and data acquisition chain in one step .",
    "the atmosphere is also carefully monitored .",
    "the density of the lower atmosphere has a well known effect on the lateral distribution of the air shower at ground level , and these weather corrections are applied to the sd energy measurements for certain studies , such as large scale anisotropy measurements  @xcite .",
    "finally , the light attenuation characteristics of the atmosphere are measured on an hourly basis during fd operations to account for varying molecular and aerosol scattering , and to monitor cloud cover  @xcite .",
    "the auger collaboration had always planned to build a northern array in order to achieve full sky coverage .",
    "the site was chosen to be in south - eastern colorado , usa  @xcite .",
    "currently there is a strong focus on an upgrade of the southern site  @xcite ( discussed in section 4 ) , and exploration of the northern sky is being undertaken by the telescope array collaboration .",
    "the telescope array ( ta ) project was originally proposed around 1997 by members of the agasa and hires experiments as a large fluorescence telescope complex with an effective aperture ( after accounting for a 10% duty factor ) of 5,000km@xmath9 sr for 10@xmath21  ev cosmic ray particles  @xcite .",
    "an apparent discrepancy in the measurements of the uhecr flux above the gzk energy by agasa and hires ( see @xcite ) , however , encouraged the members of ta to make a critical examination of the experimental methods used .",
    "this led to the present form of ta , started in 2003 , as two complete and co - sited sd and fd detectors , each observing the same uhecr events and allowing for a critical comparison of the measured shower parameters  @xcite .",
    "the ta experiment occupies a large area near the town of delta , 200 km south - west of salt lake city , utah , usa , and is now operated by a collaboration of 120 members from five countries : japan , usa , korea , russia and belgium .",
    "the experiment is conducting a high - statistics exploration of the northern sky as a hybrid array of surface and fluorescence detectors .",
    "the ta surface detector comprises 507 detectors on a 1.2 km square grid covering an area of 700km@xmath9 ( figure  [ fig : ta ] ) .",
    "each detector has an area of 3m@xmath9 and consists of two layers of 1.2 cm plastic scintillator separated by a 1 mm thickness of stainless steel  @xcite .",
    "the scintillators are equally sensitive to all minimum ionising charged particles ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , with the sd energy determination being dominated by the em ( electromagnetic ) component .",
    "this is seen as an advantage as it reduces uncertainties in the energy scale due to mass composition or hadronic physics .",
    "the array reaches full efficiency above @xmath5ev for zenith angles less than @xmath24 , providing an aperture of 1100km@xmath9sr .",
    "three fluorescence detector sites sit near the boundary of the array .",
    "one of the sites , at middle drum , uses 14 refurbished telescopes originally part of the hires detector .",
    "they are arranged in two `` rings '' that together view an elevation range from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , and an azimuth range of @xmath27 .",
    "each telescope consists of a 2 m diameter spherical mirror and a camera of 256 hexagonal pixels , with pixels viewing approximately a @xmath10 diameter section of the sky  @xcite .    the other two fd sites at black rock mesa ( br ) and long ridge ( lr ) each contains 12 newly fabricated telescopes .",
    "each telescope consists of a 3.3 m diameter segmented spherical mirror focusing light onto a 256 pixel camera .",
    "the pixels also have a field of view of @xmath10 diameter and each site covers a field of view of @xmath28 in elevation and @xmath29 in azimuth using a two ring structure  @xcite .",
    "the electronics in the new fd stations digitise the pixel signals at 10mhz with 14 bits of precision  @xcite .",
    "the ta detectors began full operation in march 2008 .",
    "various data sets are being collected , and the consistency between different data sets and different analysis procedures has been carefully examined .",
    "surface detector energy spectrum studies use contained events within the array with zenith angles @xmath30 , while anisotropy studies use looser cuts and zenith angles @xmath31  @xcite . for fluorescence analysis ,",
    "some studies are done with mono observations ( requiring observations from one fd site ) , stereo observations ( two fd sites ) , and hybrid observations . in the latter case ,",
    "fd observations are coupled with sd measurements of the shower at ground level , much in the style of auger analysis , except that timing information from more than one sd station is used , and the shower core location derived from sd data alone is used to constrain the hybrid core  @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric transparency of the ta site is monitored by a suite of instruments , including a central laser facility , ir cloud cameras and a lidar station  @xcite . in analyses performed to this point",
    ", the aerosol content of the atmosphere has been assumed to be constant with time .",
    "atmospheric transparency data has been used to determine an average value of the vertical aerosol optical depth of 0.04 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and the effect on systematic uncertainties of fluctuations about the mean has been studied .",
    "the ta project has in recent years extended its reach towards lower energy cosmic rays with the tale ( ta low energy ) extension . with an additional 10 telescopes in an extra two `` rings '' at the middle drum site , the field of view there is now @xmath32 in elevation and approximately @xmath33 in azimuth . by using cherenkov - rich events , the energy threshold of tale is below @xmath34ev , complementary to the standard fluorescence observations  @xcite .",
    "the surface detector array is being increased in density in front of this fd site to assist with lower energy hybrid observations .      the advances in our understanding of uhecr that we will discuss in the following sections owe much to the large collecting areas now instrumented by the auger and ta collaborations .",
    "additionally , the number of scientists now studying uhecr is much larger than in early generations of experiments , meaning that more manpower is available for the maintenance of the experiments , for calibration of the detectors and the atmosphere , and for devising new and creative analysis techniques and cross - checks .",
    "thus the increase in sensitivity of the modern observatories is due to more than an increase in the collecting area alone .",
    "we give some examples here of recently exploited advances in detectors , tools and techniques .",
    "a stable surface detector is necessary for optimal energy resolution , and for searching for weak broad - scale anisotropies .",
    "for example , temperature - dependent particle density measurements can introduce diurnal variations into shower rates above some energy threshold , which may be wrongly interpreted as sidereal harmonics . both auger and",
    "ta avoid this by monitoring their sd detector performance on short time scales .",
    "this is done by collecting histograms of the fundamental unit used to calibrate sd signals - in the case of ta scintillator detectors , a histogram of integrated charges from @xmath350.4 million penetrating particles is collected every 10 minutes for each detector  @xcite , while for auger wcds , histograms of signals from through - going muons are collected every minute , from which the signal due to a `` vertical - equivalent muon '' ( vem ) can be derived  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this basic calibration , auger also makes a correction ( in broad - scale anisotropy studies ) for the effect of diurnal atmospheric variations on air - shower development .",
    "these weather effects make small but significant corrections to the sd energy estimator @xmath36 ( the detector signal 1000 m from the shower core ) using the local air density and pressure  @xcite .    in fluorescence light detection ,",
    "both collaborations have benefitted from experience with the hires and fly s eye experiments .",
    "the electronics in the new fds in both ta  @xcite and auger  @xcite include sophisticated triggering circuitry , and digitisation of each pixel signal is performed at 10mhz .",
    "improved telescope design is a feature in both experiments , with auger using a schmidt optics design which gives a coma - free optical spot over a @xmath16 field of view  @xcite . at ta ,",
    "signals from uv - bright stars are used to verify ray - tracing estimations of optical aberrations , and to check telescope alignment  @xcite .",
    "calibrations of the fds feature end - to - end procedures . at auger ,",
    "a `` drum '' calibrating system is moved from telescope to telescope periodically .",
    "it uniformly illuminates the aperture of a telescope with an absolutely calibrated light source at a number of wavelengths . between these absolute drum calibrations ,",
    "the system calibration is monitored with light sources illuminating the mirror and camera  @xcite . at ta ,",
    "a small number of absolutely - calibrated pmts are in each camera  @xcite , and their gains are monitored with a radioactive source - scintillator yap unit  @xcite .",
    "the other pmts in the camera are cross - calibrated and monitored every 30 minutes during observation time using a diffuse xenon light source installed in front of each camera  @xcite .",
    "the telescope array is going one step further , experimenting at the black rock fd station with an electron light source ( els ) , which shoots a vertical beam of 40mev electrons 100 m from a fd telescope , creating artificial air fluorescence in - situ  @xcite .",
    "the els aims to make an end - to - end calibration of the fd - from energy deposits in the air to the detection of fluorescence light by the telescope  @xcite .",
    "since both experiments rely on fluorescence measurements to calibrate the sd energy scales , much effort has recently gone into laboratory measurements of the fluorescence efficiency , that fraction of the shower s ionisation energy deposit going into light production . after the pioneering work of bunner , kakimoto et al . and",
    "nagano et al .",
    "@xcite , new measurements include those of the airfly  @xcite and flash  @xcite experiments .",
    "results include precise measurements of the fluorescence efficiency and spectrum , and the pressure , temperature and humidity dependence of the light  @xcite .",
    "auger , which uses the airfly results , has been able to reduce the systematic uncertainty in shower energy associated with the fluorescence yield from 14% to 3.6%  @xcite .",
    "ta has used the kakimoto et al .",
    "@xcite fluorescence yield model , also used by hires , for the sake of consistency and continuity .",
    "it is now re - examining its energy scale using more contemporary measurements .",
    "air shower simulations are used in a variety of applications in both experiments , including the extraction of mass composition estimates from air shower development measurements .",
    "the corsika three dimensional shower simulation program  @xcite is still the most widely used , with other code such as the longitudinal profile simulator conex  @xcite being used in certain applications .",
    "the continuing challenge is to improve the implementation of high energy hadronic interactions in the code . in the last decade",
    "important new constraints on these interactions have come from measurements at the large hadron collider , spawning new hadronic models for corsika and conex , including epos - lhc  @xcite , qgsjetii-04  @xcite and sibyll  2.3  @xcite .",
    "information is also moving in the other direction , with cosmic ray experiments like auger and ta testing certain aspects of these predictions ( see section  [ sect2:interactions ] ) .",
    "the surface detectors of auger and ta are the `` work - horses '' of the respective experiments , since they are operational 24 hours per day and contribute the majority of exposure to studies such as the energy spectrum . however , both experiments use their fluorescence detectors to determine the energy scale of their surface detectors , avoiding much of the uncertainty associated with the alternative , air shower simulations .",
    "systematic uncertainties in the energy scale have been derived taking account of uncertainties in detector calibration and stability , atmospheric transmission , fluorescence yield , and reconstruction . for auger",
    "this amounts to a total systematic uncertainty of 14%  @xcite , and for ta 21%  @xcite .",
    "both quoted uncertainties are independent of energy .",
    "the most recent energy spectra were presented in 2015 by auger  @xcite and ta  @xcite . the telescope array presented a spectrum over 4.5 decades of energy from below @xmath34ev , combining results from the sd , the two japanese fd sites ( monocular reconstruction ) and tale ( figure  [ fig : taspectrum ] ) . at @xmath8ev",
    "the exposure is approximately 6200km@xmath9sryr for the sd and 650km@xmath9sryr for the fds .",
    "a remarkable set of features is present in the combined spectrum , represented by a series of five power - law segments .",
    "the flux suppression at the highest energies , identified by ta as consistent with the gzk mechanism  @xcite , is present above @xmath37ev ( @xmath38ev ) , and the spectral ankle appears at @xmath39ev ( @xmath40ev ) , again consistent with proton interactions with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite . at lower energies ,",
    "tale detects two other features , a second knee at @xmath41ev ( @xmath42ev ) , and a low energy ankle at @xmath43ev ( @xmath44ev ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainties of the tale measurements are currently being evaluated .",
    "the latest auger spectrum  @xcite ( figure  [ fig : augerspectrum ] ) is a combined measurement from the 1500 m spaced sd ( zenith angle @xmath45 ) , the fds operating in hybrid mode , and the 750 m spaced sd ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "two separate analyses were performed for the 1500 m sd array , for `` vertical '' ( @xmath47 ) and for `` inclined '' ( @xmath48 ) showers , with the latter events being muon dominated .",
    "the integrated exposures for the 1500 m vertical sd , inclined sd and 750 m sd are 42,500km@xmath9sryr , 10,900km@xmath9sryr and 150km@xmath9sryr , respectively .",
    "the energy - dependent exposure for the hybrid spectrum is 1500km@xmath9sryr at @xmath5ev .",
    "the combined spectrum extends from @xmath49ev to the highest energies , and shows the ankle feature at @xmath50ev ( statistical and systematic uncertainties are quoted ) .",
    "the flux suppression is characterised by a smooth function with @xmath51ev , with @xmath52 representing the energy at which the flux falls to one - half of the value of the power - law extrapolation .",
    "when comparing the auger and ta spectra , the following points have been made by a joint auger / ta energy spectrum working group  @xcite :    * in the overlapping region of energy , the spectral slopes are consistent within uncertainties , and the energy of the `` ankle '' is consistent given the statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "a flux difference at energies from @xmath53ev of @xmath54 could be the result of a shift in the energy scale within systematic uncertainties .",
    "* on the other hand , the energy of the flux suppression at the highest energies , characterised by @xmath55 ( a measure of the suppression energy favoured by ta  @xcite ) is inconsistent .",
    "the ta measurement is @xmath56ev , compared with the auger measurement of @xmath57ev .",
    "* the agreement in the position of the ankle and the disagreement in the suppression energy might be explained by an energy - dependent systematic uncertainty in energy , or a real difference in the physics of cosmic rays in the northern and southern hemispheres . at the current time , no source of the former has been identified and , as mentioned above , both experiments quote an energy independent systematic . as an example , differences in the correction for _ invisible energy _ used by auger and ta in the fd analyses ( i.e. that energy carried by high energy muons and neutrinos that does not result in proportionate fluorescence light ) , and differences in fluorescence yield models , produce only a small shift in the energy scale of @xmath58% which is essentially energy independent . *",
    "the possibility that the uhecr sky is different in the northern and southern hemispheres has been studied by determining the energy spectrum as a function of declination .",
    "the auger sd `` vertical '' ( @xmath47 ) spectrum covers a declination range from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , 71% of the total sky .",
    "four energy spectra have been derived for independent declination bands  @xcite , which are then compared with the total auger spectrum .",
    "a small , and statistically insignificant declination dependence in the flux is observed ( @xmath61% below the suppression energy @xmath52 and @xmath62% above ) within the declinations studied .",
    "the conclusion is that the auger / ta spectrum difference in the suppression region can not be explained in terms of a declination dependence , unless there is a significant change in the spectrum north of @xmath63 .",
    "the ta collaboration see a hint of such an effect when considering an sd energy spectrum extended to include zenith angles @xmath31 , covering a range of declinations from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "the position of the suppression energy @xmath55 is approximately @xmath66 higher for declinations north of @xmath67 compared with those south of @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "the question of a declination dependent spectrum is connected to the observations of anisotropies of the flux discussed below in section  [ sect2:anisotropy ] .",
    "currently the source of the disagreement in the energy spectrum at the highest energies is an open question .",
    "any declination - dependence of the spectrum appears weak , but more studies are on - going . in parallel , the auger and ta groups are working together to understand differences in the analysis procedures , and how these might lead to an experimental explanation for the spectral differences .",
    "the methods used by the collaborations for measuring the energy spectrum have many things in common , most importantly in the use of fluorescence measurements to set the energy scale .",
    "but there are significant differences in other areas , either necessitated by detector differences ( scintillators vs. water - cherenkov detectors ) , or because of the philosophy of the collaborations .",
    "a case in point is how each experiment accounts for the zenith angle - dependent attenuation of showers for sd measurements .",
    "the auger collaboration has a philosophy of avoiding the use of air shower simulations , wherever possible , in deriving energy estimates . to account for shower attenuation",

    "while the new observatories have not uncovered the strong anisotropies that had been predicted by some , a number of interesting results have ruled out several scenarios for uhecr sources and propagation .",
    "broad - scale anisotropies are often searched for using a harmonic analysis in right ascension ( ra ) , though increasingly more sophisticated multipole analyses are undertaken .",
    "results are challenging to interpret , as they depend not only on distribution of sources , but also on the distribution ( including turbulence ) of the galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields , and the magnetic rigidity of the cosmic rays .",

    "the _ dominance _ of protons of _ galactic _ origin around @xmath2ev is excluded by the low limits on the amplitude of the anisotropy as measured by both auger and ta  @xcite with ta concluding that less than 1.3% ( 95% cl ) of cosmic rays with energies between @xmath2 and @xmath91ev are galactic protons ( given certain assumptions about the galactic and halo magnetic fields , and assuming an isotropic extragalactic flux ) .",
    "if , in this region , an extragalactic flux is taking over from a galactic origin , the low level of anisotropy could be explained by the flux being the sum of two fluxes with first - harmonic phases almost @xmath82 apart .",

    "future joint analyses are awaited with interest .      at the highest energies , source distances are likely to be closer than 100mpc because of energy loss interactions of cosmic rays ( of all masses ) on various photon fields ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "then , if magnetic deflections are not too extreme , the arrival direction distribution will mirror the distribution of sources in the local universe .",
    "both collaborations have searched for event clustering , and for cross - correlations with various astronomical catalogs over a range of angular scales and above a number of energy thresholds .    the most recent auger data - set ( including inclined events out to a zenith angle of @xmath94 ) has been used for searches with energy thresholds between @xmath95ev and @xmath96ev  @xcite .",

    "there is no obvious source or galaxy cluster in this direction , though the excess may be associated with large scale structure , its center being @xmath104 away from the supergalactic plane .",
    "an update of the result with an additional two years of exposure showed a total of 24 events when the background expectation was 6.88  @xcite .",
    "this represents a 3.4@xmath90 post - trial significance , no change since the original result .",
    "the future evolution of this analysis will be followed with interest .",
    "the lack of strong statistical evidence for small - scale anisotropies at the highest energies starts to put constraints on the source characteristics , but those constraints are tightly coupled to the mass ( charge ) of the particles and the magnetic fields . if the uhecr were proton dominated , and if extragalactic magnetic fields are generally at the nano - gauss scale , we would need to conclude that there was a high source density within the 100mpc horizon ( e.g.  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if most of the uhecr have medium to high charge , the lack of strong anisotropy could be blamed on magnetic deflections .",
    "this emphasises the importance of the next topic in our discussion .",
    "unfortunately our access to information on the mass of uhecr is rather indirect , through observations of the extensive air showers they initiate .",
    "we must rely on models of hadronic interactions at extreme energies to interpret these observations in terms of the mass of the cosmic ray . as described in section  [ sect2:advances ] , hadronic models have improved in recent years with the availability of measurements from the lhc at centre of mass energies of up to 13tev .",
    "however , given that this corresponds to a fixed target energy of around @xmath3ev , laboratory measurements still fall short of the energies involved in uhecr interactions .    with this large caveat in mind , we can attempt to transform measurements of air shower development into estimates of primary mass .      for many years",
    "the depth of shower maximum @xmath6 has been the prime measurement for this purpose , first in cherenkov light experiments around the knee of the energy spectrum in the 1970s , and more recently in fluorescence detector measurements at the highest energies .",
    "@xmath6 is the slant depth in the atmosphere ( in g/@xmath7 ) at which the air shower reaches its maximum size ( number of particles ) or , near equivalently , at which the shower reaches the maximum of its energy deposit , @xmath105 . from simple arguments it can be shown that the depth of maximum increases with the logarithm of the primary energy for a fixed primary mass , and with the logarithm of the primary mass number , @xmath106 , at fixed energy ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "unprecedented resolution in @xmath6 is now possible with the fluorescence technique , particularly due to reliable reconstruction of the shower axis with the hybrid or stereo techniques , and partly due to finer pixelisation and digitisation in fd cameras",
    ". statistical resolution can be better than 20g/@xmath7 above @xmath5ev  @xcite , with measurement systematics below 10g/@xmath7 for auger",
    "@xcite and somewhat higher for ta  @xcite .",
    "now it is possible to confidently quote not only mean values of @xmath6 as a function of energy , but also the width ( rms or @xmath90 ) of the distribution in some energy range .    in the interpretation of @xmath6 measurements",
    ", one needs to be aware of any biases imposed by the detection or reconstruction processes .",
    "a simple example of detection bias would be a bias against the detection of showers with very deep @xmath6 ( say 900g/@xmath7 ) , since vertical showers of this type would have their maxima very close to , or below , ground level .",
    "the auger and ta collaborations have approached the detection bias issue in quite different ways , both valid .",
    "the auger approach  @xcite is to apply strict cuts on the axis geometry of air showers to avoid bias in the detection of both shallow and deep showers .",
    "despite the cost of lower statistics , this allows evaluation of the energy dependence of the `` true '' ( free of detector bias ) @xmath6 distributions , which can then be compared with theoretical predictions for various mass groups . when computing the rms of the @xmath6 distributions , the experimental resolution is subtracted in quadrature , and care is taken ( with more than one method ) to account for possible undersampling of the tails of the distributions  @xcite .",
    "the alternate philosophy , practised by ta  @xcite and inherited from the fly s eye and hires approaches , is to only apply cuts based on data quality , not potential bias .",
    "the theoretical expectation for a particular mass group is then derived using simulations of the detection and reconstruction processes , so that any biases and resolution effects are also present in the expectation .",

    "the auger collaboration has presented results on both the mean and rms of @xmath6 ( @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) from @xmath3 to @xmath109ev  @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : augermass ] .",
    "the reduction in the lower energy limit below the previous value of @xmath110ev  @xcite is due to the inclusion of data from the heat fd enhancement ( see section  [ sect2:auger ] ) .",
    "the number of events in the latest analysis is 23872 , including 7142 events above @xmath111ev .",
    "the results can be summarised as follows ,    * the rate of change of @xmath107 per decade of energy ( known as the elongation rate ) is not consistent at any energy with that expected of an unchanging mass composition , namely about 60g/@xmath7 per decade .",
    "below @xmath112ev the elongation rate is 85g/@xmath7 per decade , while above that energy it becomes much flatter at approximately 26g/@xmath7 per decade .",
    "this is interpreted as the average mass of cosmic rays decreasing with energy up to the break - point , and then increasing again up to the highest energies .",
    "( the lower energy elongation rate is compatible with the measurement by the hires / mia experiments in the same energy range  @xcite ) . *",
    "the behaviour of @xmath108 is broadly consistent with the behaviour of the mean value .",
    "up to @xmath112ev the spread of @xmath6 is roughly constant ( plausible even if the mean mass is decreasing , since a significant proton component appears to remain throughout this energy range ) , after which the spread appears to decrease with energy . * using two post - lhc hadronic models , epos - lhc and qgsjetii-04 , the experimental data are expressed in terms of @xmath113 and @xmath114 , where @xmath106 is the mass number of a cosmic ray nucleus  @xcite . with both models",

    "the epos - lhc model interprets the data with slightly heavier mean @xmath106 at all energies , compared with qgsjetii-04 . at the higher energies @xmath114 approaches zero for the epos - lhc model ( implying a single type of nucleus ) and becomes unphysically negative for the qgsjetii-04 model . * @xmath6 distributions for energy bins from @xmath110ev to the highest energies",

    "however , the intermediate masses concluded to be present at any energy have a strong model dependence .",

    "we summarise the conclusions of those studies here ,    * the md hybrid study published in early 2015  @xcite detailed the analysis of showers with energies above @xmath111ev viewed by the refurbished hires fd detector over five years . using improved profile reconstruction cuts ( based on a pattern recognition approach ) , @xmath6 resolution better than 25g/@xmath7",
    "was achieved , with a systematic uncertainty in @xmath6 of better than 18g/@xmath7 .",
    "data were compared with expectations of the qgsjetii-03 hadronic model , both in terms of the mean @xmath6 as a function of energy , and by comparing the shapes of the @xmath6 distributions in a number of energy bins .",
    "the overall conclusion was that , taking into account systematic uncertainties , the mean behaviour and the distributions are consistent with the expectations for a light , mainly protonic composition .",
    "an additional two years of hybrid md data were included in an analysis presented in 2016  @xcite with no change in conclusions . * an alternative to `` hybrid '' geometrical reconstruction of fd events using information from the sd is to use the stereo technique combining views of the shower from at least two fd sites .",
    "an @xmath6 analysis of stereo data from all three fd sites over seven years was published in 2015  @xcite , with an energy threshold of @xmath115ev .",

    "based on the behaviour of the mean @xmath6 as a function of energy , and on the shape of the @xmath6 distribution for all energies , the authors conclude that no iron is required at any energy , and that the data are consistent with protons from the early qgsjet-01c model .",
    "while pure protons from post - lhc models are disfavoured , a light composition remains consistent with the data within the systematic uncertainties .",
    "* finally , a new analysis of seven years of hybrid data from the br / lr fd stations has been presented at the uhecr 2016 conference  @xcite .",
    "this data set is the largest with 2597 events above @xmath111ev , compared with 1346 events from the stereo analysis ( @xmath116ev ) and 623 from the md hybrid analysis . with the aid of the fadc digitisation of the signals in these fd sites ,",
    "the @xmath6 resolution is improved to better than 20g/@xmath7 , though the systematic uncertainty is now conservatively quoted as 20.3g/@xmath7 .",
    "the data are compared with expectations from the qgsjetii-03 and qgsjetii-04 models , see figure  [ fig : tamass ] .",
    "one conclusion is that , within the systematic uncertainty , the mean @xmath6 versus energy is consistent with that expected for a `` light '' composition .",
    "in addition , the _ shapes _ of the @xmath6 distributions in five energy bins are consistent with the protonic expectations , and inconsistent with those of iron .    a joint group of collaborators from both auger and ta have been working to understand the differences in @xmath6 results from hires , ta and auger  @xcite .",
    "a particular question is , are the differences related to experimental factors , or due to the interpretation via hadronic models ? as we have discussed , the comparisons are complicated by the different philosophies of the experiments , with auger applying cuts designed to remove detection bias . in their latest report",
    "@xcite , the group has asked the following question : are the measurements of @xmath6 made by auger ( both the mean values and the distributions ) consistent with the measurements of ta ?",
    "this is a question quite separate from any particular hadronic model and mass interpretation , though such models must be used to `` translate '' auger measurements into ta expectations .",
    "the auger fractions of protons and nuclei of he , n and fe in energy bins above @xmath111ev were taken from  @xcite under the assumption of the qgsjetii-04 model .",
    "those mixtures were then processed through the ta detector simulation and reconstruction to give the @xmath6 distributions expected in each energy bin at ta for the auger `` mix '' , taking into account any detection bias . in particular , the comparison was done for the seven - year , higher - statistics br / lr hybrid data set described above .",
    "the conclusions are that the auger mix produces a mean @xmath6 as a function of energy that is consistent with the ta measurements within the current systematic uncertainty of 20g/@xmath7 ; and that there is also qualitative agreement between the shapes of the auger mix distributions of @xmath6 and ta distributions in several energy bins below @xmath5ev where ta has sufficient statistics . above @xmath5ev",
    "the ta data still suffer from insufficient statistics to come to more definite conclusions about the distribution widths .",
    "this important study removes much of the doubt about the consistency of auger and ta results , and shows the importance of continuing dialog between the two experiments .",
    "surface detector arrays are sensitive to variations in shower development ( and hence mass ) through measurements of parameters such as the pulse rise - time in a detector , the radius of curvature of the shower front and the lateral distribution function ( e.g. see historical examples in  @xcite ) .",
    "those arrays with particular sensitivity to muons can also attempt to tackle the mass issue through measuring the muon content of air showers , as will be discussed in section  [ sect2:interactions ] .",
    "recently the auger observatory , in particular , has explored air shower development with several sd methods , and we briefly mention two here . while the resolution in inferred mass - related parameters such as @xmath6 is typically poorer than the equivalent fd measurement , the sd has the advantage of a 100% duty cycle .",
    "the rise - time of a signal in a water - cherenkov detector , defined as the time taken for the signal to increase from 10% to 50% of the total integrated value , is related to the core - distance of the wcd and the zenith angle of the air shower .",
    "it also displays azimuthal asymmetry with respect to the azimuth of the shower axis , which can be exploited to study shower development  @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of the study is that above @xmath117ev there appears to be an increase in the mean mass of cosmic rays , but that the detail of the mass increase depends on the hadronic model assumed , and the core radius range used in the analysis .",
    "the latter dependence implies a deficiency in both of the ( post - lhc ) hadronic models used .",
    "similar interpretational issues occur with auger s measurements of the muon production depth , mpd , using inclined energetic showers above @xmath118ev  @xcite . in such showers ,",
    "the electromagnetic component of the shower is essentially absent at ground level , and the digitised signals from the wcds can be analysed to give the longitudinal profile of the production depths of muons , and the depth of the maximum of that profile , @xmath119 . while not the same as the depth of maximum of the overall shower @xmath6 ( dominated by the electromagnetic component ) , @xmath120 also has sensitivity to mass .",
    "the measurements show that the mean @xmath119 is effectively flat with energy above @xmath118ev , implying a mass increasing with energy . the mean mass implied by",
    "the qgsjetii-04 model is heavy , but that implied by the epos - lhc model is unphysically heavier than iron .",
    "again , this is an indication that the current hadronic models are not describing the measurements well .",
    "finally , there is one auger measurement , this time at energies just above the spectral ankle ( @xmath121ev ) , where it is claimed that its main conclusion is insensitive to details of hadronic models  @xcite . here",
    ", hybrid data are used to produce a scatter plot of @xmath6 vs @xmath36 , and a correlation coefficient is determined .",
    "( the energy and zenith angle dependence of the variables is removed before plotting ) .",
    "the value of the correlation coefficient is found to be inconsistent with any _ pure _ composition of _ any _ mass , with the conclusion the same for all three post - lhc hadronic models tested .",
    "this result disfavours , for example , a pure protonic cosmic ray flux around the spectral ankle , that proposed by the so - called `` dip '' model of this feature  @xcite .",
    "apart from attempting to characterise the nuclei within the cosmic ray flux , there is great interest in searching for photon and neutrino candidates within the events detected by the experiments .",
    "photons and neutrinos will be produced at some level in the sources due to interactions of hadronic cosmic rays with ambient gas and photon fields .",
    "they will also be produced through photo - pion production when the highest energy protons interact with photons of the cosmic microwave background ( often called `` gzk '' or cosmogenic photons and neutrinos )  @xcite , and several exotic models of `` top - down '' cosmic ray production ( e.g. from super - heavy dark matter ) predict significant photon fluxes ( e.g.  @xcite ) . thus measurements , or limits , on the flux of uhe photons and neutrinos are important .",
    "both ta and auger have produced updates to their photon limits in the past two years .",
    "for ta , the discrimination between hadronic and photon initiated air showers is done using a multivariate analysis of ta sd data using machine learning techniques  @xcite . among the variables tested are a shower front curvature parameter , and the signals in the top and bottom layers of the sd scintillators , the latter seeking to exploit the deficit of muons in photon initiated showers .",
    "no photon candidates were observed with @xmath47 , and 95% cl upper limits on the integral flux were derived : 0.032 , 0.0047 , 0.0021 and 0.0011 km@xmath122sr@xmath123yr@xmath123 above 3 , 10 , 30 and 100@xmath124ev respectively .    the auger collaboration searches for photons using two techniques . at lower energies",
    "hybrid data are used , and a multivariate analysis of variables including @xmath6 and a measure of the sd lateral distribution function ( ldf ) is the basis of the photon discrimination  @xcite . using 9 years of hybrid data ,",
    "three photon candidates have been identified near @xmath2ev , a number consistent with the expected mis - classification of hadronic showers .",
    "thus , upper limits on the integral photon flux are calculated for five lower energy thresholds of 1,2,3,5 and 10@xmath125ev , namely 0.027 , 0.009 , 0.008 , 0.008 , and 0.007 km@xmath122sr@xmath123yr@xmath123 ( 95% cl ) .",
    "this puts the photon fraction of the flux at less than 0.1% in the first bin and less than 2.7% in the last .    in the decade of energy above @xmath5ev ,",
    "sd data alone were used in the auger study  @xcite . there , discriminating shower parameters are related to the signal ldf , and the rise - times of the wcd signals - photon showers have steeper ldfs and longer rise - times than hadronic initiated showers . with 8.5 years of data , five photon candidates are observed ( consistent with expectations for hadronic mis - classification ) , and upper limits on the photon integral flux are @xmath126km@xmath122sr@xmath123yr@xmath123 ( 95% cl ) above thresholds of 1 , 2 and @xmath127ev .",
    "these limits are summarised in figure  [ fig : photons ] .",
    "note that while the auger results are stronger because of the larger exposure , the ta experiment explores a different hemisphere , relevant in the case of point sources .",
    "the figure shows expectations for models of top - down production of uhecr , now disfavoured at almost all energies , as are two models of cosmogenic photons which assume a pure proton uhecr flux .",
    "the experimental limits are encroaching on the cosmogenic model with optimistic selections of the source spectral index and maximum energy .",
    "the other model expectation , assuming a proton source spectral index of @xmath128 and a maximum energy of @xmath129ev , is 4 times lower than the integral limit at @xmath5ev .",
    "sensitivity to this model may be reached by the current experiments in the next decade .",
    "the current competitive limits on uhe neutrinos come from the pierre auger observatory and the icecube experiment .",
    "the telescope array has not yet published results of their searches .",
    "icecube and auger have similar sensitivities at the highest energies .    the basis of auger s neutrino search is to identify `` young '' showers at large zenith angles ( or indeed , upward - going ) in the sd dataset .",
    "a young shower at ground level is one with both electromagnetic and muonic components intact .",

    "thankfully , the near - calorimetric fluorescence technique has meant that energy assignments have very little dependence on these models .    despite the very indirect nature of our observations of cosmic ray interactions , modern observatories can contribute knowledge to the nature of hadronic physics at energies well above those probed by the lhc .",

    "both the auger and telescope array experiments have detected likely deficiencies in the hadronic interaction models employed in air shower simulations .",
    "that there are deficiencies is unsurprising , given that these models are extrapolations of direct accelerator measurements , but it is encouraging that some of the more recent models , based on lhc data , are less discrepant with respect to the cosmic ray measurements ( see below ) .",
    "an example from the ta experiment relates to the sd energy estimator @xmath145 .",
    "it has been related to primary energy using simulations of proton showers ( a preference based on hires and ta interpretations of mass composition ) and the qgsjetii-03 hadronic model  @xcite .",
    "the sd energy ( @xmath146 ) at a given zenith angle is determined as the ( simulation ) energy that reproduces the measured @xmath145 at the same zenith angle . for hybrid events ,",

    "the lateral distribution and other experimentally measured variables are well reproduced by the energy - rescaled shower simulation ( proton , qgsjetii-03 ) .",
    "the required rescaling points to a deficiency in the simulations that predicts fewer charged particles ( electrons and/or muons ) hitting the sd , although a further quantitative analysis studying the dependence on hadronic model , assumed mass composition and zenith angle is necessary .",
    "the uncertainty of the ratio @xmath147 is currently dominated by the fd energy uncertainty , which is 21% for ta , and its improvement will help to pin down the nature and the level of the deficiency .",
    "the auger collaboration has studied the muon content of inclined ( zenith angle @xmath151 ) air showers above @xmath152ev  @xcite . at these angles",
    "the electromagnetic component of the showers is absorbed by the atmosphere , and the wcd signal is essentially due to muons . using hybrid showers , the energy is known from the fd ( to within its systematic uncertainty of 14% ) and the muon content measured by the sd can be compared with expectations from simulations ( using two pre - lhc and two post - lhc hadronic models ) of proton , iron and mixed compositions .",
    "the mixed composition is that implied ( for each hadronic model ) from auger fd measurements at these energies .",
    "a relative integrated muon number @xmath153 , designed to remove the energy and zenith - angle dependence of the measurement , is used to compare real measurements with simulations .",
    "it is found that the simulations underestimate the muon measurements by @xmath154% to @xmath155% for the assumed mixed composition at @xmath5ev , over the range of models tested .",
    "the models with smallest discrepancy are the post - lhc qgsjetii-04 and epos - lhc models .",
    "the quoted systematic uncertainties arise primarily from the experimental measurement , a significant part of which is due to the 14% systematic uncertainty in fd energy . in this study ,",
    "the energy systematic is necessarily transferred to a systematic in muon number .",
    "this mixing of systematics is largely avoided in another auger study , this time with more vertical ( @xmath156 ) hybrid showers with energies between @xmath157 and @xmath158ev  @xcite .",
    "simulated showers were generated using the epos - lhc and qgsjetii-04 hadronic models for pure protons , and for mass mixtures consistent with the auger measurement for each model .",
    "then for every one of the 411 real showers , the simulation library for a given model and mass option was searched for the best match to the real longitudinal profile as measured by the fd .",
    "the lateral distribution function of that simulated shower was then compared with that measured by the sd . on average ,",
    "the simulations underestimated the signal @xmath36 for both models and both compositions , and the deficit was _ not _ constant with zenith angle .",
    "it is this zenith angle dependence that reduces the degeneracy between a systematic shift in energy or muon content , since the fd is sensitive mainly to the electromagnetic component , and the sd is sensitive to both em and muonic components , the mixture of which changes with zenith angle . the analysis results in rescale factors @xmath159 for the muon content and @xmath160 for the energy scale , for each model / composition combination .",
    "the data and the simulation can be brought into agreement with the application of @xmath159 and/or @xmath160 to the simulation .",
    "the results are that , for the mass mixture , the energy rescale factor was consistent with unity for both hadronic models : @xmath161 for epos - lhc and @xmath162 for qgsjetii-04 , where the error is the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature .",
    "however , the magnitude of the rescale factors necessary for the simulated muon numbers to match the experiment were @xmath163 for epos - lhc and @xmath164 for qgsjetii-04 , both improvements in the significance of the model discrepancies compared with the inclined air shower study discussed above .",
    "obviously , the hadronic rescale factors required for a pure - proton composition were even larger .",
    "recent preliminary results from the ta collaboration indicate that the muon content of eas at distances between 2 and 4 km from the core of the shower is substantially larger by factors of two to three ( at the @xmath165 level ) than predictions from any of the current hadronic models for both proton and iron primaries .",
    "the improved sensitivity to muons is provided by making very selective cuts that maximise the absorption of electrons by the atmosphere .",
    "results indicate that the discrepancy increases with core distance , which may imply problems with our understanding of the early part of eas development , since the muons at large core distances would originate there  @xcite .",
    "these examples show that there is sensitivity for testing hadronic models with the current observatories , taking advantage of hybrid measurements of air showers with surface and fluorescence detectors .",
    "we can expect even better sensitivity in the future using surface detectors that can separately measure muon and electromagnetic shower components , for example with the upgraded auger observatory  @xcite .",
    "linsley  @xcite first proposed a simple way to look for changes in the cosmic ray composition as a function of energy .",
    "this involves the so - called `` elongation rate '' or mean @xmath6 as a function of energy . in a simple superposition model , a pure single component composition will have @xmath166@xmath6@xmath167 depend logarithmically on @xmath168 with a constant change per decade ( the elongation rate ) .",
    "a change in the composition would create an energy dependent change in this rate . a change from a light to heavier composition",
    "would produce a decrease in the rate of change of mean @xmath6 with energy ( a flatter or even negative elongation rate ) for example .",
    "as long as there are no rapid changes in hadronic interaction physics , this is true in a model independent way .",
    "however , the elongation rate does not tell us what the composition actually is .",
    "for this , hadronic models must be used to simulate air showers , the response of the fluorescence detector must be folded in or dealt with using cuts , and the resultant absolute position of @xmath166@xmath6@xmath167 compared with data at a number of energies .",
    "there are a number of problems with this approach .",
    "firstly , the absolute predicted value of @xmath166@xmath6@xmath167 is hadronic model dependent , with variations of 10 - 20g/@xmath7 between extreme models at any given energy .",
    "then , the actual @xmath6 distribution is asymmetric and if there is a significant protonic component it will have a long tail extending to deep @xmath6 .",
    "heavier nuclei will have less pronounced tails .",
    "the mean value , @xmath166@xmath6@xmath167 , is sensitive to these tails which can be affected by detector systematics .",
    "this is one possible source of bias that can produce a systematic difference between simulations and data .",
    "studies indicate that all the various effects can produce a net residual systematic in the mean @xmath6 as large as 10 - 20g/@xmath7 for the ta experiment  @xcite , and up to 10g/@xmath7 for the auger experiment  @xcite .",
    "unless care is taken , undersampling due to low statistics may also shift @xmath166@xmath6@xmath167 .",
    "the second moment of the distribution , the rms , is sensitive to both the tails and the width of the distribution and hence carries additional information .",
    "the rms is less hadronic model dependent since the distribution width mostly depends on superposition .",
    "a change of rms from 60g/@xmath7 ( characteristic of proton showers for essentially all hadronic models ) to 30g/@xmath7 as a function of energy is observed by the auger collaboration  @xcite in the energy range above 10@xmath169ev and it can be considered evidence for a change in composition .",
    "the smaller rms can only be produced by heavier nuclei such as cno or fe , again in an essentially model independent way .",
    "however , the rms measurement suffers some of the same systematic problems as the elongation rate .",
    "undersampling of the tail of a distribution either due to low statistics or detector bias can mimic a composition change .",
    "the auger collaboration has been able to address this in some detail because of its high statistics  @xcite .",
    "the ta measurements at the highest energies still suffer from insufficient statistics to address this issue completely .",
    "a puzzling issue that has emerged from this approach is that it is difficult to reconcile the @xmath166@xmath6@xmath167 with the rms distributions . in a simple two component p / fe model for example ,",
    "the rms at the highest energies agrees well with a nearly pure fe composition but the @xmath166@xmath6@xmath167 requires a much lighter mix .",
    "reproducing this is a struggle even with a four component composition .",
    "for all these reasons , comparison of the full @xmath6 distribution between data and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations seems the best approach . in principle",
    "it provides the maximum information .",
    "however , a straightforward statistical comparison of data and simulations is made impractical because of the presence of significant systematic uncertainties both in the data ( overall @xmath6 position ) and the hadronic model .",
    "there are two approaches to deal with the problem of determining composition .",
    "the ta and hires collaborations apply loose cuts to data ( sufficient to ensure good resolution ) and carefully simulate p , he , n and fe air showers based on a variety of hadronic models .",
    "whatever distortions in the @xmath6 distribution are generated by the detection method and reconstruction should then be evident in the reconstructed simulated data .",
    "the auger collaboration instead applies much tighter fiducial volume cuts which minimise any detector and reconstruction bias .",
    "the resulting data can then be directly compared to the `` thrown '' simulations .",
    "direct comparison of the data from these two approaches can be problematic since the detector distortions will be different , though the biases in the most recent ta hybrid analysis are much smaller than for previous results .",
    "recently , the auger and ta groups have developed a method to improve comparison of @xmath6 distributions  @xcite .",
    "the auger group fits their cut and unbiased data to a simulated composition mixture as a function of energy .",
    "the resultant composition fractions are then used by the ta group to generate `` thrown '' simulations .",
    "these are then processed through the ta reconstruction process and compared to the data .",
    "preliminary results show agreement within the systematic uncertainty for the overall elongation rate .",
    "this approach is , in principle , independent of the hadronic model used , since this is only used as a method to port one data set into another experiment s acceptance .    but",
    "how does one deal with systematic uncertainties in these comparisons ? what is needed is a comparison method that allows for a sliding @xmath6 scale ( to take account of overall systematics ) while preserving the shape of the distribution .",
    "the ta group has proposed such a method  @xcite which first removes the energy dependence of the distributions and allows an @xmath6 shift for the data which is determined by the best overall @xmath6 profile fit .",
    "one can then compare the distribution shape goodness of fit to the required sliding @xmath6 scale factor to see how well any given composition assumption does when compared to the data .",
    "for example , if the scale factor shift required is well beyond the estimated systematic uncertainties and there is a poor profile shape fit , then that hypothesis can be discarded .",
    "another approach , used by auger  @xcite , is to directly compare a multi - component mix of simulated showers with the data .",
    "this is done for a variety of hadronic models .",
    "this approach uses p , he , n and fe as markers for the actual cosmic ray composition .",
    "the qgsjetii-04 , sibyll 2.1 , and epos - lhc hadronic models are used .",
    "the individual components have separate weights that vary as a function of energy and the experimental systematics are folded in to the degree that they are known .",
    "the results change as one shifts hadronic model assumptions ; while an overall trend of moving from p to he in the energy range from @xmath170ev is shared by all 3 models , only epos - lhc gives a nearly constant and large fraction of n (  40% ) across the full energy span , while the other two models are consistent with almost zero n fraction . above @xmath171ev , dominant components are he and n , but their proportions are very much model dependent ; epos - lhc favors n while the other two models strongly support he .",
    "these differences make an astrophysical interpretation challenging as they are most likely due to model inadequacies . while the details are not clear , the required proton fraction decreases above 3@xmath410@xmath169ev and there is no requirement for any significant iron fraction .",
    "the lack of consistency is not surprising given that even for a single hadronic model , hires publications  @xcite have noted that introducing more than two components into a fit to an @xmath6 distribution does not lead to an easily interpretable result as various combinations can give equally good fits . in the case of auger ,",
    "the best fits are produced with more than two components , but the uniqueness of the interpretation remains problematic .",
    "any particular approach to reconstruction shower profiles has hidden systematics which are intrinsic to the chosen approach and the particular software implementation .",
    "this systematic uncertainty is separate from detector or atmospheric systematics .",
    "two different , error - free , reconstruction programs that use different approaches ( different binning , least - square fitting routines , tabular vs functional corrections etc . ) will produce slightly different results .",
    "the ta group has explored this `` intrinsic '' systematic by comparing completely independent and otherwise well - vetted hybrid reconstruction programs as well as by comparing results from stereo data .",
    "they find that it is very difficult to make the @xmath6 distributions ( for the same data or simulations ) agree to better than 5 - 10g/@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "this seems to be an irreducible systematic uncertainty .",
    "a particular complication in the study of cosmic ray composition is the fact that any nucleus heavier than a proton will eventually fragment to a lighter nucleus as it travels from its source to the earth .",
    "this fragmentation is due to the interaction of the nucleus with both the relic 2.7k black body photons and the ir radiation fields produced by stellar radiation  @xcite . as a result",
    ", even a pure single nucleus composition heavier than a proton at the source should appear as a mixed composition .",
    "a pure proton primary composition will arrive intact , but observation of a proton component can not rule out that part of this component is due to heavier nuclei .",
    "on the other hand , observation of an iron component uniquely indicates the existence of a primary iron at the source , since stellar nucleo - synthesis does not provide any significant concentration of nuclei above iron .",
    "propagation models show that he , cno and fe have different spallation probabilities as a function of energy  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly evident above 3@xmath410@xmath172ev where the he mean free path is on the order of 10 mpc , compared to @xmath35 100 mpc for n  @xcite .",
    "a he dominated flux above 3@xmath410@xmath172ev only makes sense if sources are very close .",
    "the lack of anisotropy makes any such assertion implausible .",
    "indeed propagation calculations indicate that integrated over the large scale structure , the mean @xmath106 of nuclei originating as he is essentially one  @xcite .",
    "if the observed he is the result of fragmentation of heavier nuclei , then a proper proportion of these heavy nuclei , whose mean free paths are much longer , must also be seen in the composition distribution . incorporating the observed cosmic ray nuclear abundances found with a particular hadronic model directly with propagation effect weights in a more direct fashion than is currently done could be very helpful . in some cases , this may rule out an otherwise well fitting model as leading to astrophysically implausible scenarios .",
    "while the systematic uncertainties in @xmath6 determination and comparison to simulated compositions are still too large to make strong statements about the relative abundance of elements in the cosmic ray flux at earth or at their origin , we have learned that there is very little iron in the flux above 10@xmath169ev .",
    "given existing systematic uncertainties , it is safe to say that any direct or secondary heavy nuclei from fe to si are absent from the spectrum . we know this absence with better precision than we know what elements are present in the flux .",
    "what does this imply about the sources and acceleration mechanisms of uhecr ?",
    "uhe primary iron can easily reach the earth from as far away as 100 mpc and its spallated byproducts down to si from much further distances .",
    "are magnetic field effects strong enough to substantially increase the effective path length ?",
    "is there a deficit of iron in the cosmic material feeding the accelerator ?",
    "there is astronomical evidence that iron attaches itself to dust particles and hence appears to be somewhat depleted in its free form , for example  @xcite .",
    "however , why the iron - rich dust particles can not be swept from an accretion disk into the accelerator beam , decomposed to their atomic constituents and provide the original iron abundance is not clear . with a charge 26 times that of a proton , iron will be accelerated quite efficiently at the highest energies .",
    "if iron is indeed accelerated at the source then its absence must require photon fluxes at the source that essentially eliminate it from the cosmic ray flux .",
    "the absence of heavy elements in the cosmic ray spectrum may thus be an important constraint and clue to cosmic ray origins .",
    "much of the progress in establishing the structures in the cosmic ray spectrum come from the reliable energy scale provided by air fluorescence . with a @xmath3515% fd energy resolution and similar systematics , calibrating the sd energy scale to",
    "simultaneously observed fd events has made the sd spectrum energy largely hadronic model independent  @xcite .",
    "for the ta case , the energy scale adjustment that needs to be made between the fd and sd is on the order of 25 - 30% if one uses qgsjetii-03 proton simulations for the sd energy .",
    "the measured particle densities produce a lateral distribution which , were it analyzed based on hadronic model simulations of air showers , would generate too high an energy by this amount . in other words , there are too many charged particles at ground level for a shower with an energy as determined by the fds . because auger water cherenkov detectors are quite sensitive to muons , this mismatch has been attributed to an excess of muons in the data compared with expectation . in the case of ta",
    "s plastic scintillation detectors , electrons and muons have similar detector response and the mismatch can only be partly attributed to a muon excess .",
    "studies are proceeding to investigate whether scintillation detectors at large distances from the core which should have mainly muon initiated signals are consistent with the auger results  @xcite . in any case , it is clear that the hadronic models that are used to simulate showers are not adequate . until this issue",
    "is resolved it is difficult to use muon density to measure cosmic ray composition precisely , though trends can certainly be established ( see below ) .      [",
    "[ a .- radio ] ] a. radio + + + + + + + +    the fluorescence technique revolutionised the study of uhecr physics because it made possible a largely calorimetric determination of the energy scale and a relatively direct measure of composition using @xmath6 of the showers .",

    "recently a great deal of work has been done in investigating the possibility of using radio emission from eas in much the same way as one now uses fluorescence  @xcite .",
    "radio can , in principle , determine the shower energy and @xmath6 and would have the advantage of @xmath35100% on - time .",
    "a number of radio arrays have now been operating either stand - alone or in conjunction with surface and air fluorescence detectors  @xcite . because there are several mechanisms in the air shower development that can generate radio waves ,",

    "meaningful comparisons with real data have been done and good agreement is now evident between simulations and radio and sd measurements  @xcite .",
    "these studies have been largely limited to energies less than 10@xmath169ev however , and in this energy regime it appears that an array of radio antennas with spacings not dissimilar to sd spacings are required for good energy and @xmath6 resolution . if similar spacings is required for @xmath173 10@xmath169ev energies , the costs associated with instrumenting @xmath173 1000 km@xmath9 arrays become significant . until more complete optimisation and cost / benefit analyses for the uhecr regime",
    "are done it is not clear that this technique will supplant fluorescence and particle sd arrays . in any case ,",
    "significant physics from the low energy arrays is required before this new technique can be considered fully vetted .",
    "recently an approach to studying composition has been proposed using the correlation between @xmath6 and the sd signal  @xcite .",
    "this is based on the very old idea that if iron and proton showers have different @xmath6 distributions and different @xmath174 distributions then superposing their @xmath6-@xmath174 scatter plots will lead to a negative correlation even though the pure distributions have a positive correlation . since this is generally true of any hadronic model ,",
    "the claim of this approach is that this is more model independent than either a pure @xmath6 or pure @xmath174 analysis .",
    "however , since neither auger or ta actually measure @xmath174 ( except at large zenith angles in the case of auger ) the searched for correlation is with @xmath36 or @xmath145 .",
    "the recent work on this by auger  @xcite shows that in the @xmath175ev energy region the correlation is inconsistent with a pure composition .",
    "a preliminary study by the ta collaboration on the other hand shows no inconsistency with the assumption of a protonic composition  @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of ta , the method is not nearly as sensitive as the @xmath6 method .",
    "this may be because the muon content in ta is not as large a component of the sd signal as for auger . since the method is `` de facto '' dependent on detector muon sensitivity it must also be to some extent model dependent , although the auger study checks this with two independent models . studying the applicability of this method in the lower energy region ( @xmath139ev )",
    "would be of interest since there the composition is likely to be more pure , given both the auger and ta @xmath6 data .",
    "one of the most significant results coming from auger and ta is the overall agreement in the shape of the uhecr spectrum . at first glance ,",
    "both spectra show a clear ankle structure and a cutoff , although the precise energies for these structures differ .",
    "however , a shift of either experiment s energy scale by 10 - 15% brings the ankle structure into excellent agreement  @xcite .",
    "since such a shift is within the systematic uncertainties of either experiment , it would seem that there are no significant north - south differences here . a closer look at the ratio of the two spectra shows , however , that the location and shape of the cutoff seems different at the @xmath353@xmath90 level  @xcite .",
    "the auger - ta combined working groups have looked at this difference and , so far , have found no reason to believe it is a result of systematic uncertainties in energy .",
    "if this is truly a difference in the flux of northern and southern sources at the highest energies , there should be an overall declination dependence .",
    "preliminary evidence from ta indicates that the ta spectrum becomes much more like the auger spectrum near the cutoff if a declination cut of @xmath176 is made  @xcite .",
    "the difference ( a higher energy cutoff for ta ) must then come from higher declinations which also contain the `` hot spot '' that may be a signature for a relatively nearby source . while this is suggestive , much more work needs to be done to demonstrate that this can not be a systematic effect either in energy or aperture estimation .",
    "as indicated above , the ankle structure which is seen with high statistics in both ta and auger data can be used to estimate the difference in energy scale of the two experiments . while the result is within systematic uncertainty estimates , it is important to understand the nature of the energy shift as well as possible",
    ". given the current precise nature of shower reconstruction , differences in energy can most likely be attributed to systematic uncertainties in optical properties ( mirror reflectivity , light collection efficiency etc . ) , phototube gain calibration , atmospheric transmission and air fluorescence efficiency .",
    "all but the last are by their nature detector dependent and we must rely on the diligence of the experimenters in estimating how well they know these parameters .",
    "the air fluorescence efficiency is in principle a common factor , though it depends on humidity and temperature corrections which may be somewhat different in the two locations . for reasons of keeping a historically consistent energy scale ,",

    "neither of these experiments was able to produce an absolute value for the fluorescence efficiency with sufficiently small uncertainties to compete with the thin target experiments , though they did show that the relative longitudinal development of showers is well tracked by the resultant air fluorescence . recently a new experiment at slac called sflash  @xcite is attempting a @xmath177 10% total systematic uncertainty measurement of air fluorescence from a @xmath3510 gev electron shower developing at sea level and observed near shower maximum .",
    "if successful , this will be a valuable cross check on the thin target results .",
    "what is lacking is a common air fluorescence result that is used for both ta and auger analysis .",
    "it is to be hoped that such a convergence can occur in the near future .",
    "large scale anisotropy can be searched for using a multipole expansion .",
    "this is however tricky to do without bias unless one has full coverage over the celestial sphere .",
    "it is thus very advantageous to combine ta and auger arrival direction data .",
    "there are several challenges to using this data set however . because of the energy scale difference one can not simply apply the same energy cut for both data samples .",
    "there are also potential systematic differences in determining the detector apertures of the two detectors .",
    "the auger / ta anisotropy working group has developed an approach that uses the overlapping declination band for the two detectors  @xcite .",

    "the resultant distributions have yet to show any statistically significant dipole or quadrupole moments , though auger itself observes a significant dipole enhancement  @xcite",
    ". a better understanding of the energy scale shift between the two experiments , and strategies to deal with it , could provide a simpler method of combining data without additional assumptions .      with the fading of the auger association of uhecr with agn  @xcite , the community s hope for finding clear associations of cosmic ray arrival directions with astrophysical sources",
    "has received a lift with the possible observation ( at the 3.4@xmath90 level ) of a concentration of cosmic rays with energies above 5.7@xmath410@xmath172ev in the northern sky by the ta experiment  @xcite .",
    "this `` hot spot '' of @xmath101 radius is observed near ursa major , about 10 degrees off the supergalactic plane . if this intermediate - scale anisotropy is confirmed with more statistics its location raises interesting questions , since none of the previously assumed cosmic ray sources ( e.g. the virgo cluster ) are in the immediate vicinity .",
    "if the sources are actually in the adjacent portion of the supergalactic plane , then there must be a magnetic field effect shifting the flux to the observed location .",
    "a suggestion has been proposed that there is a magnetic flux tube produced by a filament of galaxies connecting the hot spot to sources such as m87  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is m82 which is sufficiently close to account for the hot spot using currently estimated magnetic fields .",
    "tidal disruption events creating one or more flashes of extremely high energy protons or nuclei have been proposed for the acceleration mechanism  @xcite .",
    "if this hot spot strengthens in significance it will pose a challenge to our understanding of sources and magnetic field configurations .",
    "if medium or small - scale anisotropy is finally observed the next major challenge is to correlate our composition related information with arrival direction information .",
    "hybrid fd plus sd data would be the most convincing , but requires the most running time for any given source .",
    "if the muon content of showers can be better understood and correlated with composition , this could give the most sensitive composition dependent anisotropy measurement .",
    "it is unfortunate that the currently most likely source ( ta hot spot ) and the major auger upgrade of their sds to better detect muons correspond to disconnected parts of the sky .",
    "if the hot spot is confirmed , and the muon content becomes better understood , coming to grips with this issue will be one of the major challenges for this community .",
    "above the `` knee '' at around @xmath34ev , the cosmic ray energy spectrum and @xmath6 measurement demonstrate rich features , and around @xmath5ev and above , various anisotropies seem to show up in the energy spectrum and flux . where statistics are adequate , no obvious inconsistency is found in the @xmath6 measurements in the northern and southern hemispheres above @xmath2ev , but their interpretation allows a range of composition mixes and energy dependencies due to statistical and systematic limitations .",
    "it is important for auger and ta to cover the entire sky and the whole energy region together , in order to bring these indications to a consistent set of observational facts .",
    "it will become the basis of locating the galactic to extra - galactic transition energy of cosmic rays sources , and of building a viable astrophysical model to explain the production and propagation of uhecr . continuing to challenge this physics , ta and",

    "the measurement range of @xmath166@xmath6@xmath167 using hybrid events will be extended to @xmath180ev from the present @xmath181ev  @xcite . the sd design of the ta@xmath44 was re - optimised to use a much shorter length of wavelength shifting fibers ( 1/3 of the length in the ta / sd ) while keeping the same number of photo - electrons collected by the pmt for a minimum ionising particle .",
    "the quantum efficiency and the linear range of the pmt is nearly doubled .    in the southern hemisphere ,",
    "the auger observatory plans to upgrade the detector to augerprime by 2018  @xcite .",
    "all the @xmath351600 stations will be equipped with a 3.8 m@xmath9 plastic scintillator on top and the waveform sampling electronics will become three times faster ( to 120 mhz ) .",
    "an integrated analysis of water - cherenkov and scintillator signals will enable an isolation of muonic and electromagnetic ( em ) energy deposits , and enable the counting of the number of muons hitting the sd .",
    "new methods are being developed to estimate @xmath6 from sd measurements alone , taking advantage of so - called shower universality  @xcite .",
    "the search for small - scale anisotropy and source correlation is expected to improve significantly by selecting sd events with high likelihood of being protons or light nuclei .",

    "the mixed composition result  @xcite will be further checked with measurements from the fd together with the enhanced sd with its own measurements of @xmath6 and muon content .",

    "the overlapping region at low declinations ( @xmath64 to @xmath182 ) will be important in understanding the relative exposures and to examine systematics of the detectors and data analyses .",
    "air shower detectors operating in the last decade have reported a series of earth - science related findings ; ta s sd recorded bursts of particle showers associated with lightning  @xcite , the development of distant atmospheric `` elves '' was recorded by auger  @xcite , and the lopes radio signal from air showers was modulated by thunder - clouds  @xcite etc .. uhecr observatories may become an interesting research tool for earth and atmospheric sciences in the next decade .      understanding",
    "the mechanism of air showers generating radio signals in the sub-100 mhz range has advanced greatly in the last decade ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "newly developed simulation codes tell us that the radio signal comes from two types of time - varying , fast - moving effective charges generated in the air shower ; one is the lateral movement of shower e@xmath183 under the geomagnetic field and the other is the longitudinal movement of net charge in the shower front ( the askaryan effect ) . both signals scale with the square of the electromagnetic energy ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "the signal is sharply forward peaked in the direction of air shower development and stands well above the galactic radio noise for energies exceeding 10@xmath185ev .",
    "the radio telescope lofar , operating in cosmic ray detection mode , realised a very fine radio sampling of air showers , and succeeded in observing air showers of energy 10@xmath186 - 10@xmath187ev with a typical @xmath6 reconstruction uncertainty of 17g/@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the aera radio array with varied antenna spacing has been deployed at the auger site for testing the detection of the highest energy showers  @xcite .",
    "the results demonstrate that a dense deployment of antennae is required for the effective detection of uhecr that have a footprint of several 100 meters in diameter .",
    "even though the elements of the rd ( radio detector ) may be relatively simple and inexpensive , the total cost of deploying and operating a large area detector would become prohibitive .",
    "one practical application for uhecr is for the measurement of very inclined air showers with @xmath188 , which has an extended oval footprint larger than 10 km@xmath9 .",
    "such rds deployed together with the sd may also be used for the calibration of sd energy , making use of the fact that the radio signal originates predominantly from the em component of the shower , and that it has a negligible attenuation in the atmosphere . note that this is the kinematic region where precise measurements by standard sd techniques , using a water - cherenkov station or a scintillator , have large uncertainties , and redundant information is useful .",
    "the radio detector is also expected to have a high duty factor of @xmath3595% .",
    "another direction of progress foreseen for using radio signals from eas is the detection of high energy neutrino - induced showers in the antarctic ice via the askaryan effect . pioneering work searching for such short , ghz polarised radio signals from the horizon in antarctica began with the anita balloon experiment in 2006  @xcite .",
    "its 4th flight was launched in december 2016 .",
    "the ara and arianna experiments were recently proposed and extensive rd is underway to detect the askaryan signal from cosmogenic neutrinos near or on the surface of the antarctic ice  @xcite .",
    "searches for ghz `` molecular bremsstrahlung '' radio emission from particle showers in the atmosphere  @xcite have so far not been successful  @xcite .",
    "also , a limit has been set by the tara experiment at the ta site for detecting the modulation of 54.1mhz carrier radio waves by the ionised column generated by a uhecr shower in the atmosphere  @xcite .",
    "the euso international collaboration was formed in 2000 to install a wide field of view ( fov ) telescope at the international space station ( iss ) to look down on the earth s atmosphere and search for air fluorescence flashes from uhecr  @xcite .",
    "the jem - euso detector employs a fresnel lens telescope with a diameter of 2.4 m and a 60@xmath89 fov , covering a ground area of 200 km radius from an altitude of 400 km  @xcite .",
    "the effective ground coverage with the expected duty factor of 20% is 28,000km@xmath9 , or approximately five times that of augerprime and ta@xmath44 combined",
    ". a tilted mode of observation would increase the acceptance by a factor of three or more at the cost of reduced resolution and higher detection threshold .",
    "the iss inclination angle of 51.6@xmath89 allows a uniform survey of the earth s atmosphere in the northern and southern hemispheres with nearly the same acceptance and event geometry .",
    "the observations from high altitude and the limited optical entrance pupil of the fresnel lens will however limit the jem - euso detection threshold to be @xmath189ev , and the @xmath6 resolution is foreseen to be larger than 60g/@xmath7 in the nadir mode  @xcite , making the differentiation of nuclear composition difficult .",
    "the mission schedule of jem - euso is yet to be determined , but an extensive series of tests of the prototype instruments is being performed  @xcite .",
    "major efforts include the balloon borne euso - spb test ( 2017 ) , and deployments of mini - euso ( 2017 ) and k - euso ( 2020 ) at the iss .",
    "the k - euso experiment will have a segmented fresnel mirror 3.4 m in diameter , and its effective coverage of the ground will be 6,200 km@xmath9 above 10@xmath190ev , about equivalent to augerprime and ta@xmath44 combined .",
    "an exploring russian satellite experiment , tus , with similar optics was launched in 2016 and is being commissioned  @xcite .",
    "the uniform all - sky coverage of k - euso will be very important in understanding the nature of the north - south anisotropy , or the inconsistency of the flux , being seen by ta and auger .",
    "given that observations by the extended ground detectors will proceed well into the next decade , and that exploratory space projects will start giving a large acceptance coverage of the entire sky , what are the new and/or remaining challenges for future ground observatories ( fgo ) of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ?",
    "in this section , we take `` auger@xmath410 '' as a hypothetical example of an fgo , and discuss how the fgo might look , and how research might proceed with the fgo .    *",
    "fgo : * we assume `` auger@xmath410 '' is a symmetric set of northern and southern observatories , each with 30,000 km@xmath9 ground area , covered in whole by hybrid arrays of fds and sds .",
    "an array of radio detectors ( rds ) may be overlaid on the sd to enhance the energy and possibly the @xmath6 determination for inclined events , improving the quality of all sky coverage .",
    "we assume the sd is equipped with a particle identification function for a fraction of shower particles , and that this is to be used for the likelihood tagging of the primary composition .",
    "approximately 10 % of events are sd - fd hybrid , which offers a direct means of composition determination via @xmath6 .    *",
    "composition at the cutoff : * such an fgo will collect approximately 10,000 sd events above @xmath55 ( 10@xmath191ev for ta ) or above @xmath192 ( 10@xmath193ev for auger ) in 10 years of operation , of which about 1,000 events will be sd - fd hybrid . protons and iron",
    "are the natural nuclear species to compose a cutoff structure , due to their expected abundance at the acceleration site and their comparative stability in the subsequent propagation in the nearby ( @xmath35100mpc ) universe .",
    "indeed propagation calculations indicate that cosmic rays above energies of @xmath194ev will have a simplified , approximately bimodal arrival composition , even if they are produced in equal proportions from protons to iron at the source .",
    "intermediate mass nuclei will appear mostly as proton and he spallation by - products .",
    "thanks to the high statistics , the improved @xmath6 resolution and the additional n@xmath195 information of the fgo hybrid events , we expect that contributions of protons and iron will clearly stand out in a @xmath6 @xmath196 @xmath174 scatter plot . protons or iron at the cutoff will be a straightforward confirmation of the existence of the corresponding astrophysical mechanism that creates the strong suppression , either the gzk or the acceleration limit scenarios .",
    "if protons and iron were both identified in the hybrid sample it would allow the measured estimators of composition , @xmath6 and n@xmath195 , and their predictions by the simulation code , to be `` calibrated '' by the observation .",
    "even when contributions of he , cno and heavier nuclei are significant ( and the isolation of protons and iron is not obvious ) , we still expect proton and iron contribution , because the existence of he results in ( spallation ) protons , and the existence of cno calls for the parent fe of the spallation ( see sections  [ sect3:using_xmax ] and [ sect3:lack_of_iron ] for a discussion ) .",
    "the statistics of the fgo hybrid sample , 1,000 events above @xmath55 or @xmath192 , would allow a reasonable `` calibration '' or cross - check to be performed for compositions in the range of protons ( z=1 ) to iron ( z=26 ) .",
    "* composition dependent anisotropy and energy spectrum : * the sd and rd events of the fgo are tagged with a likely primary mass derived from the @xmath6 and n@xmath195 analysis , both of which are being calibrated using hybrid events .",
    "the statistics of these events , 10,000 or more in total above the flux suppression , is enough to allow the flux , energy spectrum and composition of uhecr to be separately determined in @xmath35100 different sections of the sky .",
    "their correlations , such as the `` proton / iron sky above a certain energy '' and the  energy spectrum of proton / he / cno / iron in particular sections of the sky \" , can be plotted from a single unified event sample .",
    "this will be very effective in establishing astrophysical models to explain the observed features of uhecr .",
    "searches for auto - correlation and association with astrophysical sources , as well as the multi - messenger analysis , will be effectively made using the tag of primary composition .    as a result",
    ", we can continue investigating the nature of galactic and extra - galactic magnetic fields , background photons in the universe , cosmological development of uhecr sources , special relativity with exceptionally high lorentz factors , and other subjects in astro - particle physics .",
    "* cosmogenic @xmath197s and @xmath70s : * the search for uhe neutrinos and gamma rays by the fgo will be limited only by statistics , using the primary composition tagging of the fgo / sd .",
    "the sensitivity to cosmological neutrinos and gamma rays will allow us to enter the region of possible detection , or of placing significant limits on standard predictions ( see section  [ sect2:photonsneutrinos ] ) .    * uhe interactions : * our understanding of ultra - high energy air showers is incomplete ;",
    "the data from present detectors indicate that the number of shower particles in the off - core region is larger than what the simulation program predicts , or that the simulated air shower is `` slimmer '' than the real one ( see section  [ sect2:deficiencies ] ) . using a large collecting area and high sensitivity for penetrating particles ,",
    "this is most clearly demonstrated for muons detected in the auger water - cherenkov stations .",
    "the difference between the data and the simulation remains after the ambiguities from energy determination and primary composition are removed , and updated hadronic interaction models with the lhc data are used  @xcite . using composition - tagged sd events of the fgo ,",
    "the lateral distribution of muons and electrons in the off - core region , and its relation to the primary energy and composition will be studied .",
    "the measurements are to be compared with a variety of model predictions with the highest energy lhc data , including taking into account nucleus - nucleus collisions .    in the case where a certain region of the sky is identified as protonic without significant contributions of heavier components",
    ", the ankle and the cutoff features in this region could possibly be attributed to the pair - production on the cmb and the gzk effect , and the corresponding energies can be used for calibrating the energy scale of the incoming protons . while it is possible that there may still be a contribution from galactic protons , this can be checked by examining the ratio of the ankle to gzk energies and the berezinsky modification factor  @xcite as a function of light / heavy anisotropy . in any case , the possible anisotropies of these ratios would be of great importance in constraining cosmic ray origin and propagation models . given that these features are able to be associated with pair production and the gzk cut - off , then the difference between the expected primary energy and the measured calorimetric energy by the fd or rd is to be accounted for by the `` invisible energy '' carried underground by the very high energy muons and neutrinos in the shower core region . in this way , we expect ultra - high energy air showers will remain as a source of observational information for the study of the nature of hadronic and nuclear interactions beyond collider energies .    * fd : * measuring the energy and composition of uhecr will remain a basic mission of the fgo .",
    "the fgo / fd does this by covering the entire acceptance , but with a limited duty cycle of @xmath3510 % .",
    "the fgo / rd would cover a limited acceptance at large @xmath198 but with a duty cycle higher than 90% , and its eventual contribution may become significant . when working in hybrid mode with the sd ,",
    "some of the fd information is redundant .",
    "this leads to the fast concept of deploying an array of compact , wide - angle and essentially single pixel fd telescopes that record the time development of air fluorescence in multiple stations  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of the shower core location and arrival direction may be achieved mainly by using the sd information , and the time variation of the fast signal is then converted into the longitudinal development of the shower . the fast detector would work exclusively for supplying the calorimetric energy and @xmath6 information of the event .",
    "optimisation studies have been performed with the goal of obtaining good resolution with limited photon statistics . controlling the effect of background photons on - line for the trigger and data acquisition",
    "remains a technical challenge .",
    "a small fd telescope with a similar concept has been tested by the crafft team  @xcite . the current design of fast assumes fd stations with 360@xmath89 azimuthal coverage on a rectangular grid of 20 km separation . a total of 75@xmath42 fd stations will be necessary to cover the entire fgo acceptance in the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "* sd : * the fgo / sd is expected to have a good particle identification capability for shower particles .",
    "the isolation of muons will be of particular importance , and various types of detectors have been tested during the design study of augerprime using the existing water - cherenkov station as a bulk muon counter and absorber of the em component .",
    "here we remind the reader of another example , the `` lead burger '' : a sandwich of segmented scintillator and lead absorber , tested in the agasa array as a candidate for the original auger sd detector  @xcite .",
    "advances in photo - detectors and electronics may now allow a significantly finer detector segmentation and fast waveform sampling , strengthening the multi - hit capability of the lead burger  @xcite .",
    "de / dx measurement and coarse tracking of individual particles may also be incorporated . besides muon identification , detection of spallation neutrons",
    "may be possible for tagging the nuclear composition and identifying primary gamma rays .",
    "ta and auger are ideal testing grounds for developing the fgo / sd and for optimising its performance . taking the 2.1 km grid spacing of ta@xmath44 as an example",
    ", 6,900@xmath42 sd units will be necessary to fill the fgo acceptance .",
    "* electronics and network : * the fgo electronics may follow the base design of auger and ta with fadc sampling of wave - forms , multi - level digital triggers and wireless communication networks .",
    "for the fgo / sd , the number of readout channels must be significantly increased for the segmented detector and for the integration of fgo / rd , and faster digitisation is required for better timing measurement .",
    "the biggest challenge would be that all these performance upgrades need to be realised with a limited power budget due to local electricity generation and storage .",
    "taking advantage of the low duty cycle of sd digitisation electronics , clever methods could be invented to save electric power consumption .",
    "reliability and fault - tolerance are required for the stable operation of many fgo / sds distributed over a large ground area . with a steady increase of locally available computing and data storage capacities ,",
    "real - time requirements for trigger generation and data acquisition may be loosened , and greater autonomy may be allowed for the operation of individual sds . this in turn reduces the network load of communications between sds , and increases the overall system reliability .",
    "it may also allow for the whole communication system of the fgo to reside on a standard communication network .",
    "this will be advantageous in terms of construction cost , long - term operation and for taking advantage of progress in communication technologies and updates in the daq system .",
    "implementing a prompt coincidence trigger formed over several clustered sds , assuming it is required , may be a technical challenge in building such an autonomous daq system .    for the fgo / fd array , the load on digitisation electronics will decrease compared with the current many - channel system , but triggering on a limited number of sensor pixels will be itself a challenging task .",
    "a clever time coincidence method between the neighboring sds and fds , or the introduction of an external trigger via the network , may be a resolution to this problem .",
    "reliable remote operation of the telescopes , monitoring and calibration devices via the wireless network is the key to the success of achieving good operational performance of the fgo .    *",
    "collaboration : * the construction and operation of the fgo will be a challenge for technology , management and resources .",
    "it may be accomplished only through a collaboration of people with zeal , having excellent expertise and experience .",
    "some of the features of the fgo detector , electronics and communication system were already discussed in the proposals for northern auger and augerprime  @xcite .",
    "the physics issues , and an experiment of similar sensitivity to the fgo known as `` ta2 '' , have been discussed in physics community meetings in japan .",
    "the era of the very large observatories has produced many new and important insights into the properties of the ultra - high energy cosmic ray flux .",
    "this has been achieved with well designed detectors and very large collecting areas , with important design input from previous generations of experiments .",
    "an important feature of both auger and ta is the hybrid nature of the observations .",
    "apart from providing calorimetric energy measurements , a hybrid observatory offers a multitude of cross - checks which have improved the measurements and reduced the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the uhecr energy spectrum is now measured with high statistics , resulting from a combined auger / ta exposure of over 60,000km@xmath9sryr at the highest energies .",
    "the spectrum now reveals several features including an unambiguous suppression beyond @xmath95ev .",
    "a dipole anisotropy has been observed for the first time at ultra - high energies , and there is great interest in the possible northern hemisphere `` hot spot '' over a @xmath101 radius area of sky which will be monitored by ta@xmath44 for an increase in significance in coming years .",
    "small - scale anisotropies and associations of cosmic ray arrival directions with astronomical catalogs have not been convincingly observed .",
    "it is probably fair to say that this lack of success was not expected .",
    "this may be related to an apparent increase in the cosmic ray mass and charge above the ankle of the energy spectrum .",
    "while not currently embraced by the entire community , a heavier flux would help to explain the lack of small - scale anisotropy . on the other hand ,",
    "if the northern hemisphere `` hot spot '' persists , its appearance may be related to mass composition differences between the north and the south .",
    "the difference of the flux suppression energies between auger and ta may also suggest that the astrophysics is not identical in both hemispheres . in that context",
    ", a composition dependent anisotropy study will be of great interest .",
    "the promising aspect is that our measurements of air shower development , whether they be from fds or sds , are continuing to improve , with the likely future outcome being the ability to ( at least ) identify the lighter fraction of the flux with a surface detector , 24 hours per day , as being realised by augerprime .",
    "photon and neutrino limits set by the experiments have ruled out certain exotic production mechanisms for the highest energy cosmic rays , including the decay of super - heavy dark matter .",
    "they are now probing cosmogenic photon and neutrino models that may provide information on the fraction of protons present at the highest energies .",
    "finally , measurements at the observatories are constraining some aspects of hadronic and nuclear interaction models at very high energy , a remarkable feat given the indirect view of the interactions afforded by characteristics of the air shower .    as well as these achievements",
    ", we have also discussed the present challenges for the field .",
    "for example , despite much progress in measurements at accelerators , and despite constraints from ultra - energetic cosmic rays , we do not know the systematic uncertainty to attach to a simulation prediction for the mean @xmath6 of a proton ( or any ) shower , reducing the power of our mass measurements and their influence on the open astrophysics questions .",
    "it also means that we are currently limited in being able to confidently select showers initiated by low charge primaries in our attempts to improve the sensitivity to anisotropies , especially since we do not yet have a mass estimate for every event we observe .",
    "finally , we still lack sufficient collecting area to answer some of the big questions , given that we appear to be faced with a cosmic ray sky remarkably free of strong anisotropies at the highest energies .    for the future",
    ", we must build on this impressive progress with new ideas and techniques that will lead to new observatories that are sufficiently large ( and cost - effective ) to answer the remaining questions . while further increases in collecting area are of prime importance , it seems crucial that future ground observatories be endowed with at least some mass - composition sensitivity for all collected events .",
    "we thank all of our colleagues in the pierre auger and telescope array experiments for their inspiring collaboration . while we have benefitted greatly from discussions with many of them over the years ,",
