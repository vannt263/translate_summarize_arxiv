    "the detection and initial investigations of highly ionised emission line species in agn , has been possible for several decades eg . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however it is only relatively recently that sensitive near - ir spectroscopy and ifus have renewed the impetus to use these features as diagnostics of both the ionisation processes and gas kinematics . at high energies",
    "x - rays and the ultraviolet , observational evidence has been accumulating in support of the presence of outflows .",
    "although estimates of the mass in the outflow are difficult to make and assumption dependent , in some cases it may be substantial , and the associated kinetic energy a significant fraction of the bolometric luminosity ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* reeves et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ) ) .",
    "thanks to advances in the technology of near - ir arrays , we now have significant numbers of agn with high quality spectra from 1 - 2.5@xmath0 eg . @xcite and @xcite . although generally the near - ir spectral resolution is not yet comparable with similar samples at optical wavelengths .",
    "based mostly on optical studies there is now convincing evidence of blue - shifts of the highly ionised species with respect to the systemic velocity , see @xcite and @xcite . in a recent study @xcite used spectra mined from the sdss catalogue to select 63 agn , based on the strength of their [ fex ] 6374 line emission .",
    "clearly such a sample has a strong selection effect , but it is valuable to compare its properties with other studies which almost aways draw their targets from the optically brighest and best observed agn .",
    "@xcite find strong correlations between the x - ray continuum and lines of [ fex ] and [ fexi ] , as well as a trend for the broadest hil profiles to have the highest blue - shifts .",
    "smaller samples of agn have been observed via narrow band imaging in the emission line of [ sivii ] 2.48@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite showed that in a small sample of seyfert 2s , the region is extended from a few tens up to 150pc , making it significantly less extended than the nlr .",
    "furthermore , several studies of the hil , for example recent work by @xcite , have shown that the profiles of the hils can often be deconvolved into several components , and that the broadest of these has a fwhm in between those of the blr and the nlr ( as typified by the [ oiii ] line at 5007  ) . finally , a very recent study of hils using hst+stis data ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "although statistical studies of high ionisation line species detected in large samples of agn , such as those mentioned above are very useful , these need to be complemented by detailed studies of some individual cases . in their seminal study of the optical and near infrared coronal lines in ngc1068 , @xcite , demonstrated the diagnostic potential of combining several ratios of hil of various elements and ionisation species .",
    "however , ngc1068 is a seyfert 2 , and presumably some proportion of the region emitting the highly ionised gas will be blocked by the torus .",
    "it would therefore be desirable to make a detailed studies of seyfert 1s .",
    "@xcite used new spectroscopic data on the nls1 akn564 , and extended the modeling techniques described in @xcite .",
    "they were able to build a self consistent model which explains both the line ratios and kinematics of the highly ionised gas .",
    "in essence this model invokes gas liberated from the the dusty torus , and then accelerated to its terminal velocity . in principle",
    "this model can be tested and constrained using additional hil species , and high spatial resolution spectroscopy .",

    "an elongation can be seen towards the north ( top ) , of a few tenths of an arcsec .",
    "the projected physical extent is @xmath242pc .",
    "interestingly the blue - shift from systemic velocity of both the on and off - nucleus profile is about the same ie .",

    "[ ngc3783b ] ) .",
    "this lack of a velocity gradient is what might be expected if one were viewing a conical outflow roughly aligned along the line of sight .",
    "more detailed modelling of spatially extended emission line ratios is in progress .",
    "because the hil emitting region is very probably statified , good spectral resolution is essential to deconvolve the line profiles .",
    "this , combined with high spatial resolution is now possible using ifus such as sinfoni , and a start has been made on a few nearby agn .",
    "other routes are also available . for example , one of the key open questions regarding the innermost hil region , is the nature of the ionisation mechanism .",
    "this is assumed to be via photionisation based on estimates of the gas temperature , and good correlations with the high energy continuum .",
    "however , the crucial continuum photon energies lie in the unobservable region of the spectrum . to circumvent this",
