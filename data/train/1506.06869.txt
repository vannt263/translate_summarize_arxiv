    "it is known since the beginning of recursion theory that there is a close relation between the computational power of a set @xmath0 and the classes of recursive and partial recursive functions which can be dominated by an @xmath0-recursive function @xcite : the halting problem @xmath10 is turing reducible to @xmath0 iff every partial recursive function is majorised by some @xmath0-recursive total function iff some fixed @xmath0-recursive function dominates all partial recursive functions .",
    "furthermore , martin showed that a set @xmath0 has high turing degree iff there is an @xmath0-recursive function @xmath12 dominating every total recursive function .",
    "this generalises to r.e .",
    "turing degrees by the fact that an r.e .",
    "set @xmath0 is low@xmath13 iff some @xmath10-recursive function dominates all total @xmath0-recursive functions .    for r.e .",
    "sets , one has also the further result that @xmath14 iff the convergence module of @xmath0 is majorised by some @xmath15-recursive function .",
    "it is also known that for sets @xmath16 , @xmath14 iff for every @xmath0-recursive function @xmath12 there is a @xmath15-recursive function @xmath17 majorising @xmath12 .",
    "this does , however , not generalise to the larger class of the sets below @xmath18 : there is a nonrecurisve set @xmath19 for which every @xmath0-recursive function is majorised by a recursive function ; such a set @xmath0 is said to have a hyperimmune - free degree @xcite .",
    "there have also been various attempts to generalise domination to relations between the partial recursive functions of two relativised worlds .",
    "for example , stephan and yu @xcite considered the notion where @xmath0 is strongly hyperimmune - free relative to @xmath15 ; here @xmath0 is strongly hyperimmune - free relative to @xmath15 iff for every partial @xmath0-recursive function @xmath12 there is a partial @xmath15-recursive function @xmath17 such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "their results include the result that , when @xmath23 then @xmath0 is strongly hyperimmune - fre relative to @xmath15 iff @xmath14 .",
    "so real power in terms of the degrees of being strongly hyperimmune - free is only achieved by being above @xmath10 .",
    "one of the reasons for this phenomenon was that the domains have to be compatible in the sense that whenever @xmath12 is defined so is @xmath17 and furthermore @xmath17 is above @xmath12 .",
    "the notion investigated in the current work tries to overcome this shortcoming by permitting @xmath17 to be above the value @xmath24 not at @xmath3 itself but at places below @xmath3 . in this initial work",
    ", the emphasis is more on domination than majorisation ; that is , on the question of when there is a partial @xmath15-recursive function dominating all partial @xmath0-recursive functions in this sense",
    ". then @xmath15 must be properly above @xmath0 and already the question when this can be done with the lower oracle being recursive turned out to be an interesting and challenging notion .",
    "the notion itself stems from a principle in reverse mathematics , more precisely , it is motivated by the bounded monotone enumeration principle bme .",
    "chong , slaman and yang @xcite introduced bme in order to analyse the rate of growth of a finite collection of partial recursive functions in a nonstandard model of a fragment of peano arithmetic . the ability to control the growth rate in that model was key to separating stable ramsey s theorem for pairs from ramsey s theorem for pairs over the system rca@xmath25 .    the formal definition of when a function pdominates another function or a set of functions is the following .",

    "a set @xmath0 is pdominant iff some partial @xmath0-recursive function pdominates the set of all partial recursive functions .",

    "thus , if one relativises the notion , one can have two oracles , namely @xmath0 and @xmath11 , such that a total @xmath11-recursive function dominates all partial @xmath0-recursive functions though @xmath56 .    for further properties of @xmath11 ,",

    "the first results will deal with @xmath7 classes which are a convenient tool to construct sets of various types ; for the construction of pdominant sets , they turn out to be of limited value as no @xmath7 class consists entirely of pdominant sets and some do not contain any pdominant set .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , @xmath7-classes are classes of sets represented by their @xmath57-valued characteristic functions and they are not empty .",
    "furthermore , a @xmath7-class is called nonrecursive iff it contains only nonrecursive sets .",
    "@xmath7-classes correspond to the sets of infinite branches of recursive trees .",
    "every @xmath7-class contains a set which is not pdominant .",
    "let a @xmath7-class be given as the infinite branches of a recursive tree @xmath58 .",
    "now one defines inductively a sequence of trees @xmath59 such that the following holds for all trees :    * @xmath60 ; * each @xmath61 is linked to two numbers @xmath62 such that @xmath63 is computed by the function @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the minimum possible size of the set @xmath66 when @xmath15 ranges over the infinite branches of @xmath63 ; * @xmath67 is a recursive tree having exactly those infinite branches of @xmath63 for which the intersection @xmath68 \\cap dom(\\varphi_e^b)$ ] contains at most @xmath65 elements .",
    "note that the intersection of a descending sequence of binary trees with infinite branches is not empty , as each tree defines a compact subset of the set of possible infinite branches and the intersection of a descending intersection of nonempty compact sets is not empty in the cantor space .",
