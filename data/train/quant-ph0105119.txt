    "<S> we study general teleportation scheme with an arbitrary state of the pair of particles ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) shared by alice and bob , and arbitrary measurements on the input particle 1 and one of the members ( 2 ) of the pair on alice s side . </S>",
    "<S> we find an efficient iterative algorithm for identifying optimum local operations on bob s side . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we find that simple unitary transformations on his side are not always optimal even if particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 are perfectly entangled . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the most interesting protocols in the language of extremal completely - positive maps .    of many potential applications of quantum information processing , </S>",
    "<S> the quantum teleportation is probably the most appealing example . </S>",
    "<S> several experiments @xcite have been done since the first proposal in @xcite , confirming thus that teleportation  a popular subject of sci - fi literature  is indeed feasible ; at least if one deals with simple quantum objects .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that ideal teleportation requires a source of maximally entangled particles and a very delicate measurement on the sender s side . </S>",
    "<S> this is not always easy to do with realistic experimental devices . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it has been shown in @xcite that a never - failing bell - state measurement is impossible with linear elements and detectors only . </S>",
    "<S> more severe limitations might arise if the teleported object gets more complicated .    </S>",
    "<S> however , even with restricted resources there is still the possibility to optimize the teleporting scheme . </S>",
    "<S> a natural question is : what is the optimum local operation on particle @xmath1 ( output of teleportation ) for the given resources of the shared entangled pairs of particles ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , and of the measurements performed jointly on particle @xmath0 and the input particle @xmath2 ? </S>",
    "<S> several attempts have been done in this direction . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the authors analyzed a teleportation with realistic linear elements . </S>",
    "<S> they found that local unitary transformations on the side of receiver are not always optimum ; sometimes more general operations can improve the performance of the realistic protocol . </S>",
    "<S> optimization of protocols with arbitrary shared entangled states has been pursued in @xcite and @xcite but the optimization was done over local unitary transformations only .    </S>",
    "<S> the main goal of this paper is to consider the most general case . for the given resources of the sender ( type of the measurement on particles @xmath2 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 ) and resources on the quantum channel shared by two parties ( the state of particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) we will optimize the teleportation protocol by finding the optimum local operation that should be applied by the receiver on particle @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the naive picture suggesting that every interaction of a quantum system with environment leads to a `` loss of information '' , we here find that such an interaction on receiver s side might enhance the fidelity of teleportation even if the pair of particles constituting the quantum channel are perfectly entangled .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper has two parts . in the first one we will derive an iterative algorithm that solves our problem . in the second part we will try to describe the most interesting protocols involving two - level systems in the language of extremal completely - positive maps .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the teleportation of an unknown state @xmath3 of particle @xmath2 between two parties called alice and bob . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that before the teleportation starts they share two particles in an arbitrary state @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> alice then performs a measurement on particles @xmath2 and @xmath0 and sends the outcome by a classical channel to bob . based on the classical communication he receives he performs a local transformation on particle @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the optimum local transformation is such that the final state of particle @xmath1 gets as close to the input state @xmath3 as possible on the average .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurement performed by alice will be described by a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) @xmath5 , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> its elements generate probabilities of all possible outcomes of alice s measurement . </S>",
    "<S> consider the situation where one such particular outcome , say @xmath7 has been registered with probability @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the state of the third particle conditioned on this result reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 now bob applies a local ( @xmath11-dependent ) transformation on this state . </S>",
    "<S> the most general transformation is a trace preserving completely positive ( cp ) map of the form @xcite @xmath12 the state describing the ensemble of teleported particles is obtained by averaging ( [ cp ] ) over all possible outcomes , @xmath13 the optimality of the given set of local transformations will be judged by the fidelity of the corresponding teleported state . to simplify further considerations let us assume that the input state is pure @xcite . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity can be defined as follows : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the input state in the hilbert space of particle @xmath1 . using eqs .  ( [ state - cond ] ) and ( [ final ] ) </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity becomes @xmath16 where @xmath17 mean averaging over a priori distribution of input states . </S>",
    "<S> the average fidelity @xmath18 will be our global measure of quality of the given teleportation protocol that is to be maximized over the set of all possible local operations applied to particle @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> although the following optimization can be carried out for arbitrary dimensional hilbert spaces we will illustrate the idea on the simple example of spin-@xmath19 particles . the generalization to more dimensions is straightforward .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by decomposing the input density matrix in some basis of hermitian generators . in the case of spin @xmath19 the convenient choice is the basis of pauli spin matrices . after substituting the decomposition in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fidel ] ) and simple integration over the whole surface of poincare sphere ( we assume that all possible input states are equally - probable states , hence the isotropic a priori distribution ) , we get @xmath20 where @xmath21 where @xmath22 and where we have dropped now unnecessary subscript of particle @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> .    since cp maps corresponding to different registrations @xmath23 are independent , each term on the right - hand side of ( [ f2 ] ) can be maximized independently . </S>",
    "<S> omitting therefore notation @xmath11 and taking the constraint @xmath24 into account , the expression to be maximized is @xmath25 variation of this expression with respect to @xmath26 gives the extremal equation in the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the ( hermitian ) lagrange operator . </S>",
    "<S> it can be determined from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cp - extrem ] ) as follows : @xmath29 where we have introduced hermitian operators @xmath30 which provide another representation of the cp map @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cp - extrem ] ) can be brought to the form suitable to iterations . </S>",
    "<S> multiplying it by @xmath32 from the left and summing over @xmath33 we obtain @xmath34 a formula suitable to iterative solving is obtained by adding @xmath35 to the left - hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cp - vec ] ) and rearranging , @xmath36 the iterative algorithm for finding optimum cp maps based on eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cp - lagrang ] ) and ( [ iter ] ) is the main formal result of the present article . </S>",
    "<S> starting from some `` unbiased '' cp map , for example @xmath37 ( means that particle @xmath1 is always brought to the maximally mixed state ) , the equations can be successively iterated until the stationary point is attained . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we get the operators @xmath38 corresponding to the optimum local transformation of particle @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> notice that the average fidelity of teleportation bears very simple form when expressed in terms of @xmath39 , @xmath40 notice also that @xmath18 is a linear functional of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that all its maxima lie on the boundary of the set of physically allowed operators @xmath38 that is determined by the constraint of complete positiveness of the corresponding local transformations . </S>",
    "<S> so there is a clear connection between optimum teleportation protocols and extremal cp maps . </S>",
    "<S> the topology of cp maps is a well studied field related to many problems in quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> we will use some of the recently derived results on cp maps for the discussion of some cases of special interest in the present problem .    </S>",
    "<S> but before we come to this point let us first demonstrate the usefulness of our iterative optimizing algorithm on some interesting examples involving spin @xmath19 systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that ideal teleportation protocols ( @xmath41 ) utilize a source of maximally entangled pairs of particles and a bell state analysis on alice s side . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is definitely more difficult to realize in a laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> let us therefore analyze the realistic situation with an ( almost ) perfect source of shared particles but with an imperfect measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the imperfect measurement will be drawn from this one - parametric family of povms , @xmath42 here @xmath43 and @xmath44 are two orthogonal states , for example states spin up and spin down in the @xmath45 direction and @xmath46 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> one boundary point @xmath47 corresponds to the perfect bell measurement . </S>",
    "<S> alice gets no information about the incoming state but the teleportation with fidelity one is possible . </S>",
    "<S> the other boundary point @xmath48 corresponds to a projective measurement on the first particle and no measurement on the second one . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and we have only two distinct outcomes @xmath51 less information is extracted about the input state and an imperfect quantum teleportation is possible . </S>",
    "<S> as we have mentioned above we will take particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a maximally entangled state , for instance let them be in the singlet state @xmath52 accordingly , the operators @xmath53 have the form , @xmath54 where @xmath55 the operators @xmath56 generated by the remaining three povm elements @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 differ from ( [ rr ] ) only in signs of its elements and hence their contribution to the average fidelity ( [ f3 ] ) is the same </S>",
    "<S> .    fidelities ( [ f3 ] ) of the optimum bob s local transformations that were found by our iterative algorithm ( [ cp - lagrang ] ) and ( [ iter ] ) for the above alice s measurements are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - fidel ] ( solid line ) .    as could have been anticipated , the fidelity continuously changes from the classical limit @xmath60 @xcite to the maximum value of @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the optimum cp maps for @xmath61 are actually local unitary operations . </S>",
    "<S> however for @xmath62 unitary operations are not optimum , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - fidel ] ( dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> this becomes trivial statement if @xmath63 . in that case </S>",
    "<S> alice performs no measurement on particle @xmath0 and therefore the state of particle @xmath1 remains a complete mixture for any outcome @xmath11 she obtains . </S>",
    "<S> so the fidelity of `` teleported '' state is @xmath19 if one is allowed to perform unitary transformations only . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , if one adopts more general transformations , bob can construct the input state with fidelity @xmath64 on the basis of the outcomes of alice s measurement ( which is here optimal state estimation ) thus attaining the classical limit .    </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting situations correspond to alice s measurements that allow non - classical teleportation only if followed by a _ </S>",
    "<S> non unitary _ operation on bob s particle . in our case </S>",
    "<S> this happens for @xmath65 ( see later ) and the optimum cp map turns out to be a kind of decoherence process @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us emphasize again that the above simple example of teleporting spin @xmath19 system has been chosen for the sake of simplicity only . if needed , our iterative algorithm could be straightforwardly generalized to larger hilbert spaces . </S>",
    "<S> the generalization consists of replacing pauli spin matrices by the appropriate basis of hermitian operators in that space and replacing the integration over the surface of the poincare sphere by the integration over the surface of generalized @xmath66-dimensional sphere .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the relative simplicity of the set of cp maps operating on a @xmath0-dimensional space allows one to get further insight into the optimum teleportation protocols and obtain analytical results . </S>",
    "<S> we will therefore stick to the teleportation of spin @xmath19 particles in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> first let us express the local operation acting on the bob s particle using operators @xmath38 , @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are defined as follows : @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the bloch vector defining the state of the bob s particle before he applies the operation @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> to each local operation on the bob s particle there correspond a simple transformation of the poincare sphere : the unit sphere is mapped onto an ellipsoid , the lengths of its axes being the eigenvalues of @xmath69 , which is translated by @xmath68 from the origin . </S>",
    "<S> of course the ellipsoid has to lie within the unit poincare sphere ( positivity ) . </S>",
    "<S> however not all such ellipsoids define _ completely _ positive maps which are the most general maps in quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> recently it has been shown @xcite how to parameterize the set of _ extremal _ cp maps comprising the boundary of the convex set of all cp maps . </S>",
    "<S> this set contains all optimum bob s local transformation . </S>",
    "<S> matrix @xmath69 can be always brought to the diagonal form by a local unitary transformation . </S>",
    "<S> when in diagonal form , extremal cp maps can be parametrized by two angles @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 with @xmath76 , @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> now let us show how the above example can be elegantly solved using this trigonometric parameterization of extremal cp maps . due to the form of matrix @xmath78 eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rr ] ) it can be shown that the optimum cp map is degenerated , @xmath79 , so there is only one free parameter left ( see appendix ) .    substituting the map ( [ uv ] ) with @xmath79 together with the povm element ( [ rr ] ) into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f3 ] ) and maximizing the fidelity with respect to @xmath74 one easily finds the analytical expression for the optimum fidelity : @xmath80 ( \\cos^2\\theta+2\\cos\\theta+3)/6 ,   & \\cos\\theta\\in [ \\frac{1}{2 } , 1 ] \\end{array }   \\right.\\ ] ] in contrast to this , the fidelity of the optimum local unitary operation is given by the second of the two expressions for all angles @xmath81 and thus coincides with the optimum value if @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the optimum unitary operation is the identity map @xmath82 ( bob leaves particle @xmath1 alone ) for all @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical solution confirms the results obtained numerically with the help of our iterative algorithm shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - fidel ] . </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting alice s measurement ( [ povms ] ) is that for which optimum unitary operation just gives the classical limit @xmath83 , but enables non - classical teleportation using a non - unitary cp map . </S>",
    "<S> this happens for @xmath84 , optimum fidelity being @xmath85    the enhancement of quantum teleportation by non - unitary process has recently been discussed by badziag and horodeckis family @xcite in a slightly different context . </S>",
    "<S> they considered teleportation protocols with perfect bell analyzer but imperfect preparation of the shared pair of particles and found out that teleportation protocols can sometimes be enhanced by the interaction of the teleportation device with environment ( damping ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most pronounced example yielded improvement corresponding to our @xmath84 case . in fact the choice of our povms ( [ povms ] ) which are bell states being subject to a kind of decohering process has been inspired by their result . </S>",
    "<S> now we can use the language of extremal cp maps to explain why the result of badziag _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ is so exceptional . </S>",
    "<S> a general teleportation protocol is , in fact , a cp map composed of two different maps : the first one @xmath86 being the alice s transformation of the input state to the output state sent to bob ; the second being the local operation @xmath72 on the output state applied by bob . </S>",
    "<S> the teleportation protocol @xmath87 becomes perfect if the two maps make up the identity map : @xmath88= \\bar{\\rho}_3,\\quad \\forall \\bar{\\rho}_1.\\ ] ] obviously , the most interesting protocols are protocols where both parts @xmath86 and @xmath72 are _ extremal _ cp maps , because they contain optimal maps , see discussion after eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f3 ] ) , and because all remaining protocols are just convex combinations of such `` extreme '' protocols . among the protocols consisting of two extremal maps one can find the standard teleportation , both maps here being unitary operations , but this is also the case of our example ( [ povms ] ) ! </S>",
    "<S> this is immediately seen using another equivalent representation of our @xmath86 @xcite : @xmath89 where @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is partial transposition with respect to system @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> for povms from our example ( [ povms ] ) and shared singlets ( [ max - ent ] ) we have that the operator @xmath92 is at most rank @xmath0 operator and hence the map @xmath86 it generates is extremal . also , the associated operators @xmath56 , entering the fidelity expression ( [ f3 ] ) in a similar way as @xmath38 do , posses the form of ( [ uv ] ) .    the trigonometric parameterization of optimum cp maps hints on a possible generalization of horodecki s considerations . </S>",
    "<S> one could think of a situation where the first cp map @xmath86 would not be degenerated with respect to angles @xmath73 and @xmath74 [ unlike in ( [ rr ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> such non - degenerated alice s povms would not however lead to substantially new physics since also in this case the optimum bob s operation would be realizable by a unitary operation on an enlarged space of the third qubit followed by tracing out the auxiliary degrees of freedom  thus representing a damping channel @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the trigonometric parameterization ( [ uv ] ) also provides a nontrivial lower bound on the fidelity of teleportation . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that bob , for the lack of invention , decides just to repeat the first cp map which results from alice s measurement in the sense @xmath93 . in non - degenerated case </S>",
    "<S> this simple protocol yields fidelity @xmath94 and angles @xmath73 and @xmath74 define both @xmath56 and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this results shows another interesting , but not surprising , feature of extremal cp maps : if used by both parties they cover the whole range of non - classical fidelities .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have derived an iterative algorithm for finding optimum cp maps for quantum teleportation . </S>",
    "<S> it provides a convenient way of optimizing teleportation protocols on hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied our procedure to protocols with imperfect bell analysis and have identified situations where a unitary transformation on the third particle is not optimal and should be replaced by a more general completely - positive map .    * acknowledgements * : </S>",
