    "[ fig : fig3 ] , and the decrease due to orbital polarization ( about 1.6 ev ) is visualised by the arrow .",
    "the lowering of the ground state energy is associated with a partial co and oo which arises in the @xmath5 states , however , it does not generate the gap opening yet .",
    "in fact , the calculation suggests that this is rather a metastable state , showing only short - range charge - orbital correlations without well defined symmetry .",
    "total energy @xmath158 _ decreases _ further from that obtained for the state with co and oo induced by finite coulomb interactions for increasing phonon distortion @xmath312 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) , which leads eventually to the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the strongest decrease of the total energy was found for the @xmath0 mode . on the contrary , by considering a single @xmath307 phonon amplitude we have verified that this type of distortion does not induce any energy decrease .",
    "instead , the acoustic @xmath1 phonon mode leads to the energy lowering when local coulomb interactions are present .",
    "therefore , we included in fig . [",
    "fig : fig3 ] also the energy dependence for this acoustic mode .",
    "the energy decrease is here smaller than in case of the @xmath0 mode .",
    "note however that because of double degeneracy the total energy may also depend on the phase .",
    "finally , the groundstate energy for the @xmath38 symmetry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] as the lowest dashed line . since the lattice deformation induced by either @xmath0 or @xmath1 mode is not sufficient to lower the energy to this level , other ops have to be active as well .",
    "the changes in the electron dos induced by the considered phonon modes at the @xmath35 point are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "they are compared with the respective dos found for the undistorted structures with @xmath37 and @xmath38 symmetry , respectively .",
    "the results of the calculations performed in the gga and in the gga+@xmath3 approach are shown on the left and right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , respectively .",
    "the main effect of finite @xmath3 for the cubic structure is to increase the exchange splitting between the up and down spin states , cf",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) and [ fig : fig4](e ) . the up - spin states at fe(@xmath7 ) ions and down - spin states at fe(@xmath8 ) ones",
    "are shifted to lower energies below @xmath317 .",
    "in addition , finite @xmath3 decreases the spectral density of minority @xmath5 states just above @xmath317 .",
    "this indicates the enhancement of electron localization due to local electron interactions , which leads to gap opening in the distorted structure .",
    "first observation connected with the ep interaction is that the overall effects of @xmath0 and @xmath307 distortion are much weaker for the uncorrelated ( @xmath23 ) case than for the correlated ( @xmath163 ev ) one .",
    "comparing these two distortions for @xmath23 [ figs .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) and [ fig : fig4](c ) ] , we see that the strongest coupling is associated with the @xmath0 phonon . especially for down - spin states above",
    "@xmath317 one finds a decrease of the spectral density .",
    "this instability is connected with the @xmath35 nesting vector at the fermi surface , as discussed some time ago by yanase and hamada.@xcite it is quite remarkable that this effect alone does not suffice to induce a metal - insulator transition , but such a transition is triggered when it is amplified by local hubbard interaction @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , when the @xmath0 distortion is made in presence of finite @xmath3 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](f ) ] , the gap opens at @xmath317 , and the metal - insulator transition takes place . note that apart from some subtle differences , the distribution of the spectral weight near @xmath317 found with the @xmath0 distortion is quite similar to that found in the @xmath38 phase [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](h ) ] .",
    "surprisingly , the @xmath307 mode does not produce a similar effect , although the changes of the electron dos were here similar to those due to @xmath0 for @xmath23 , and the ep coupling is here also much stronger than for @xmath23 .",
    "this result agrees perfectly with the group theory analysis of sec .",
    "ii , showing that @xmath0 is the primary op and @xmath307 is neither primary nor secondary op for the vt .",
    "we remark that the influence of the @xmath1 mode on the dos has been discussed previously,@xcite and it does not induce the insulating gap either in spite of its significant coupling to the electronic density .",
    "thus , we conclude that the @xmath0 mode plays the decisive role in the metal - insulator transition which accompanies the vt .      realistic treatment of the charge and orbital order requires the electronic structure calculations with finite local coulomb interactions using lsda+@xmath3-like methods .",
    "the electronic dos in the cubic phase [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](e ) ] , as well as earlier experimental studies,@xcite suggest that magnetite is an itinerant magnet and not a mixed valent system .",
    "the vt is therefore not due to freezing of charge fluctuations at fe(@xmath7 ) ions , but rather due to the symmetry change , which leads only to weak co as a consequence of the undergoing phase transition .",
    "this scenario is confirmed by the changes in the electron dos above and below the vt , as the gap at the fermi energy induced by the @xmath0 phonon [ see fig . [",
    "fig : fig4](f ) ] splits the @xmath5 band into the occupied states at the @xmath212 and @xmath213 fe ions and empty states at the @xmath206 and @xmath207 ions .",
    "thus , this mode is responsible for the charge disproportionation which persists also in the @xmath38 phase [ fig . [",
    "fig : fig4](h ) ] : increased @xmath5 electron density for @xmath318 ions and reduced density for @xmath319 ions .",
    "note that four fe(@xmath7 ) sites split into two subclasses as a result of the lattice distortion in the @xmath0 mode [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a ) ] .",
    "the amplitude of the charge ( spin ) disproportionation is comparable with that found for the @xmath38 symmetry ( see table vi ) .",
    "interestingly , this co pattern is _ similar _ to that proposed originally by verwey and fulfills the anderson criterion .",
    "these findings agree also with other lsda+@xmath3 and gga+@xmath3 calculations.@xcite    in addition , we have found that the @xmath0 mode stabilizes the oo in the @xmath5 states . the resulting orbital polarization with atomic displacements",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a ) .",
    "in the considered mode the atoms vibrate along the @xmath309 $ ] direction , and the dominating components are those connected with distortions of fe(@xmath7 ) ions and oxygen ions in the same planes .",
    "oxygen displacements are 65% of fe(@xmath7 ) displacements , while fe(@xmath8 ) atoms shift only by about 23% of them ( not shown ) .",
    "the considered mode is limited to single fe ",
    "o planes : fe(@xmath7 ) ions move along with o ions in one plane , while atoms in neighboring planes do not move at all ( they participate in the other @xmath0 branch in the perpendicular direction ) .",
    "this deformation modifies distances between fe(@xmath7 ) atoms and oxygens situated above and below them , inducing changes in the electron density distribution within @xmath5 states and a coexisting charge and orbital order in the @xmath212 and @xmath213 chains . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , electrons occupy orthogonal @xmath320 and @xmath321 orbitals , thus forming the state with alternating oo .",

    "the balls indicate fe and o ions in the respective crystal structure , with the same meaning of colors as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the arrows in ( a ) represent the atomic displacements in the @xmath0 mode.,width=309 ]    this coexisting charge - orbital order and the insulating gap induced by the @xmath0 mode has to be compared with that observed in the monoclinic phase of @xmath38 symmetry [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](b ) ] . the electronic dos for this symmetry",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](h ) .",
    "the magnitude of the gap is similar to the gap generated by the @xmath0 phonon mode shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](f ) , however , the occupied states below @xmath317 belong now to the @xmath230 ions and empty states to the @xmath231 ones .",
    "actually , fe(@xmath7 ) ions are split into two groups @xmath230 and @xmath231 , as average fe  o distances for the bonds to the @xmath231 sites are significantly smaller than those for the @xmath230 ones .",
    "therefore , the co has to change from that promoted by the @xmath0 mode alone .",
    "surprisingly , the weak co found in the lt monoclinic phase does not satisfy the anderson criterion , but plays no role in the actual mechanism of the transition .",
    "the corresponding orbital pattern also has changed [ see fig . [",
    "fig : fig5](b ) ] .",
    "the occupied states on @xmath212 and @xmath207 irons form the alternating oo with the orthogonal orbitals on the nearest neighbor iron sites . we emphasize that in the @xmath38 frame , the occupied @xmath5 states are given by @xmath323 and @xmath324 combinations .",
    "therefore , on comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a ) and [ fig : fig5](b ) , we conclude that the @xmath0 mode demonstrates a generic tendency towards the oo within the @xmath5 minority states , but only partly explains the observed oo in the lt phase with @xmath38 symmetry .",
    "this is however quite natural and expected , since the @xmath0 mode is only one component of the ops that condense at the vt , which _ all _ finally lead to the change of symmetry to the lt monoclinic phase .    in the next step , one should consider the superposition of the @xmath0 with the @xmath1 mode .",
    "the latter one is crucial to explain the doubling of the unit cell and the observed charge - orbital pattern . as we mentioned before",
    ", this mode is double degenerate and the atomic displacements depend on the phase .",
    "so , a detailed analysis of the ep coupling , similar to that presented above for the @xmath0 modes , is rather difficult .",
    "moreover , because of the system complexity , it is likely that the atomic displacements belonging to the secondary ops are also involved in the final charge - orbital order . in spite of these difficulties ,",
    "the studies presented in this section demonstrate how the phonons interplay with charge and orbital degrees of freedom in the vt .",
    "from the results presented in the previous section and from the earlier experimental studies , it is clear that the mechanism of the vt includes two essential ingredients : ( i ) strong intraatomic coulomb interactions @xmath179 at fe ions , and ( ii ) phonon - driven lattice instability . on the one hand ,",
    "the electron interactions are responsible for the orbital polarization , which breaks the symmetry of the wavefunction and enhances the electron localization in the @xmath5 states . on the other hand ,",
    "the phonon ops induce the crystal distortion , which generates the structural transformation from the cubic @xmath37 phase to the lt phase with monoclinic @xmath38 symmetry .",
    "the coupling between these two subsystems is crucial since none of them alone would be able to explain the metal - insulator transition which occurs in magnetite at @xmath19 .",
    "as we have shown , without the hubbard interaction @xmath3 , the ep interaction would be too weak to induce structural changes . in the presence of electron correlations ,",
    "the coupling between the electrons in @xmath5 states and phonons is largely enhanced since it leads to stabilization of the oo and to lowering of the total energy .",
    "the corresponding co is very subtle and seems to be rather a consequence of the joint effect of the oo and enhanced ep interactions than the driving force of the vt .",
    "the splitting of the @xmath5 states due to the ep interaction is usually referred to as the jahn - teller effect . in principle , the mechanism observed in magnetite is similar to this effect , however , it differs in many respects from the classical examples . in a typical situation ,",
    "one considers the displacements of oxygen ions around the transition metal cations , which break the symmetry and split the degenerate @xmath2 states . as we discussed in the previous sections ,",
    "the displacement pattern in the monoclinic structure is more complicated and involves also @xmath325b@xmath326 ions . in particular , in the @xmath0 mode",
    "the iron atoms ( with largest amplitudes ) vibrate in the same plane as oxygens .",
    "therefore , the orbital polarization results in this case mainly from the interplanar interactions between iron and oxygen ions .",
    "a dynamical coupling between the charge - orbital fluctuations and phonons induces the critical diffuse scattering above @xmath19 .",
    "temperature dependence of this scattering gives us important information about precursors , which show up far from the critical point .",
    "the signs of the transition appear already at about 200 k. apart from neutron scattering coming from @xmath327 and @xmath328 points,@xcite there are maxima at other positions , also with an incommensurate wavelengths .",
    "for instance , very pronounced critical behavior was observed at @xmath329 .",
    "@xcite when temperature is lowered , the coupling between different modes , described by the landau free energy ( [ free ] ) , leads to stabilization of particular phonons with commensurate wavelengths . very close to the transition point , about 5 k above @xmath19",
    ", the @xmath1 op becomes active , producing the signal in neutron measurement.@xcite the question arises why is this mode observed only a few kelvins above @xmath19 , while signals from the @xmath31 and @xmath176 points are seen at much higher temperatures ?",
    "this may be connected with the relative strength of different ops . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we see that the coupling to @xmath1 mode is weaker than to @xmath0 mode , and it gives a different signal in neutron scattering .",
    "critical scattering is one of indications of a short - range ( charge and orbital ) order above the vt , first discussed by anderson.@xcite another evidence is connected with the change in entropy , which is smaller than in the order - disorder phase transitions.@xcite also the temperature dependence of resistivity at @xmath330 , which is not typical for metals , suggests the polaronic nature of charge carriers .",
    "first photoemision measurements indicated the gap closing above @xmath19 , @xcite but more detailed studies@xcite established that the gap only decreases , without any sharp change at @xmath19 .",
    "the optical conductivity studies suggest also the gap opening below @xmath19 , but above the transition the conductivity spectrum does not exhibit a metallic drude - type behavior.@xcite instead , a hopping type conductivity is observed , with highly diffuse character of charge dynamics .",
    "this picture is supported by the structural exafs studies , which found that the local crystal geometry does not change at @xmath19 . @xcite",
    "it means that the quasistatic lattice distortions are present already in the high - symmetry cubic phase above @xmath19 .",
    "all these results are consistent with the present theory , which shows that some phonons strongly couple to electronic states and may induce local crystal deformations and polaronic short range order above @xmath19 .",
    "as demonstrated in this work and the previous study,@xcite the theoretical approach based on the gga+@xmath3 ( or lda+@xmath3 ) provides a very good description of the vt .",
    "however , there are some aspects , which involve dynamical processes and many - body interactions . for example",
    ", the detailed analysis of the photoemision spectra showed that the dft is not sufficient to explain changes induced by the vt and better agreement with experiment can be achieved only by using the dmft approach.@xcite an interesting effect was observed in the spin excitation spectrum , which shows a large splitting in the acoustic magnon branch at @xmath33 below the vt.@xcite this effect can not be explained merely by the dependence of exchange interactions on the crystal structure or charge ordering , but is rather a consequence of the magnon - phonon coupling .",
    "additionally , a recent neutron scattering study revealed an anomalous broadening and energy shift of the @xmath1 spin wave above @xmath19.@xcite a strong spin - phonon interaction , suggested by the present work , provides a sound starting point for studying such effects .    finally , the behavior of magnetite at high pressure is rather intriguing .",
    "according to diffraction studies,@xcite the critical temperature @xmath19 decreases with pressure , so the vt can be induced at rather low temperature by applying pressure in the lt monoclinic phase . recently",
    "two contradicting views on the vt based on pressure experiments have been suggested . on the one hand ,",
    "a possible transition from the inverse to normal spinel structure has been suggested as consistent with the interpretation of the mssbauer and x - ray scattering measurements.@xcite this scenario precludes a co on the fe(@xmath7 ) sites below @xmath19 , but predicts a large @xmath264% increase in the bulk magnetization with increasing pressure or by lowering temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "no change in magnetic moments at both @xmath8 and @xmath7 sites has been detected by the neutron diffraction studies in a broad range of pressure up to @xmath331 gpa.@xcite this latter result rules out a posibility of the inverse spinel to normal spinel transition under decreasing temperature ( increasing pressure ) , at least in the regime of pressure lower than @xmath332 gpa .",
    "it also agrees with earlier band structure calculations,@xcite and with the present mechanism of structural transition in magnetite . as the electron occupations at @xmath8 and @xmath7",
    "sites are modified rather weakly , no significant change in the values of magnetic local moments is expected .",
    "we emphasize that this latter view does not imply large co below the vt .",
    "in fact , the structural transition suggested in the present work not only _ explains _ the dramatic change in the conductivity observed at @xmath19 , but also _ predicts _ rather weak co , in agreement with experiment.@xcite",
    "in this work , we have presented a detailed group theory analysis of the verwey transition .",
    "we have identified three primary ops : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath30 , which describe the symmetry reduction in the crystal structure transformation from the high - temperature cubic @xmath322 phase to the lt monoclinic @xmath38 phase . by performing the numerical _ ab initio _ computations ,",
    "we have demonstrated that a prominent role is played by the @xmath0 mode which : ( i ) couples strongly to the electronic states , ( ii ) lowers the total energy , and ( iii ) is responsible for the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the latter transition occurs only when local coulomb interaction @xmath3 is explicitly included in @xmath5 iron states and may trigger weak charge order at @xmath7 sites .",
    "in fact , this pnenomenon appears counterintuitive and occurs only as a result of the accompanying local lattice distortions which may be seen as a jahn - teller lattice instability .",
    "these results support the recent point of view@xcite that neither pure electrostatics is the main factor responsible for the charge order observed below the verwey transition , nor the charge order is the mechanism driving the transition by itself . at the same time , the local coulomb interaction generates alternating orbital order , which leads to strong reduction of charge mobility and amplifies electron - lattice effects .",
    "the present study reconciles several previous points of view on the verwey transition in magnetite and suggests that the physical effects which occur simultaneously below this transition in the monoclinic @xmath38 phase can be classified into the ones which are the primary cause of the symmetry change and the ones which occur only as its consequence .",
    "in this way it contributes to the recent debate concerning the origin of the transition and clarifies the role played in it by the charge order . while weak charge order has been found at fe(@xmath7 ) sites , it is not surprising that it does not obey the verwey model .",
    "in fact , it is only one of the manifestations of strong local electron interactions in partly occupied @xmath5 states rather than the primary cause of the observed symmetry change .",
    "we have also compared phonon energy spectrum of magnetite with the experimental data obtained by raman and infrared spectroscopy , as well as by neutron scattering .",
    "we have found that phonon frequencies strongly depend on local electron interactions , and the gga+@xmath3 calculations performed with realistic parameters for fe ions ( @xmath163 ev and @xmath164 ev ) give very satisfactory qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental data .",
    "in contrast , when the electron interaction effects are neglected , the phonon spectra are even qualitatively different from the observed ones .",
    "summarizing , we have shown that the verwey transition is promoted by a set of order parameters with mixed electron and phonon character .",
    "the insulating monoclinic @xmath38 phase occurs below the transition as a result of the instability driven by the electron - phonon coupling in presence of strong electron correlations .",
    "we argue that the electron - lattice coupling plays an important role also in other transition metal oxides with strongly correlated electrons .",
    "further studies of the lattice relaxation effects in these systems may lead to discoveries of new electronic phenomena that could be understood only by simultaneous treatment of electronic and lattice degrees of freedom .",
