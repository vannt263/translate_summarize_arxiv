    "it is generally believed that the phase - resolved spectra can provide the most detailed information about the structure of the pulsar magnetosphere , acceleration mechanism , and , pair creation and radiation processes in the outer magnetosphere . @xcite and @xcite firstly calculated the phase - resolved spectra of the vela pulsar .",
    "then , @xcite and @xcite calculated the phase - resolved spectra of the crab pulsar in the @xmath2-ray and the x - ray regimes separately .",
    "it will be interesting to find a general scenario that can produce both the @xmath2-ray and the x - ray regimes in the phase - resolved spectra of the crab pulsar .",
    "our preliminary results have been reported in the 2006 cospar conference @xcite .",
    "we have continued to study the phase - resolved spectra of the crab pulsar in more details . here , we present our recent results with a different parametric fitting @xcite .    according to @xcite ( @xcite ; hereafter chr ) ,",
    "the outer gap starts at the null charge surface , ends at the light cylinder , is bounded below by the last closed field line and is bounded above by a layer of electric current which replenishes charges to the open field lines outside the gap to maintain a steady charge density , the goldreich - julian charge density @xcite , @xmath3 the charge depletion within the outer gap due to global flows of charged particles causes a large electric field along the magnetic field lines so that @xmath4 inside the gap . this gap",
    "thus acts as an accelerator to boost the charged particles to relativistic speeds . through a cascade process",
    ", high energy @xmath2-ray photons and e@xmath5 pairs are produced .",
    "recently , the classical outer gap model is being challenged by @xcite . by solving the set of maxwell and boltzmann equations , they find that a current at nearly goldreich - julian rate can shift the position of the inner boundary of the outer gap .",
    "therefore , we adopt a modified version of the chr outer gap model such that the inner boundary of the outer gap is shifted inwards .    the photon emission mechanism starts with curvature radiation of the accelerated charged particles in the gap .",
    "the emission direction is tangent to the local magnetic field lines . as a photon escapes",
    ", it may encounter a low energy photon .",
    "the low energy photon may be a thermal photon from the stellar surface or a magnetospheric soft synchrotron photon emitted by the secondary e@xmath5 pairs which are created by the curvature photons from the inner field lines .",
    "the primary curvature photons will then be converted into the secondary e@xmath5 pairs via photon - photon pair production , i.e.  @xmath6 or @xmath7 inside and outside the gap . as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "although pair production inside an outer gap is limited to a small region , pair production outside the outer gap can cover a much wider area because the synchrotron photons produced by the secondary pairs are more abundant than the thermal photons from the stellar surface .",
    "although the secondary synchrotron photons can not get into the outer gap due to the field line curvature , they can convert most of the primary curvature photons from the outer gap into secondary pairs . since the synchrotron radiation is beamed to a small angle by the relativistic beaming effect @xcite , synchrotron photons",
    "will also be seen as more or less tangent to the field lines if observed .    besides curvature radiation and synchrotron radiation",
    ", inverse compton scattering is another important radiation mechanism in the neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "it occurs when a fast moving electron or positron collides with a photon and net energy is transferred from the particle to the photon . in the far region of the magnetosphere ,",
    "the relativistic particles collide with the soft synchrotron photons through the inverse compton scattering process .",
    "@xcite and @xcite calculated the light curves by considering a single outer gap with the photon emission to be beamed to the outside alone in order to avoid the multiple - peak feature that does not occur in true observation data of the crab pulsar .",
    "@xcite pointed out the lack of a reason to explain the ignorance of the incoming photons ( the photons that are beamed towards the star ) .",
    "however , in section  [ emigeo ] , we estimated that inward emission is much fainter than the outward emission ( see also @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , since the previous models by @xcite and @xcite considered emission beyond the null charge surface only , they suggest that the observer can measure the photons from one gap only , that is , a single - pole model is considered in the canonical model . however , if the gap extends below null charge surface , the photons originating from another gap become measurable by the observer as well . in this paper , therefore , although we follow @xcite and @xcite to calculate the light curve , we consider both gaps , that is , a two - pole model is examined .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the pulse profile and the phase - resolved spectra for the crab pulsar with an outer gap accelerator model . because the crab pulsar is one of the brightest @xmath2-ray sources in the sky , the detailed observation for the pulse profile and the phase - resolved spectra",
    "have been obtained .",
    "these provide useful information to the study of the non - thermal processes in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "since the crab pulsar is still young and is believed to have a thin gap , calculating the contribution from one layer suffices . by fixing an inclination angle and an observer angle , the photon emission locations that produce the light curve are used to calculate the phase - resolved photon spectra which are compared with the observation data . for the crab pulsar , we adopt @xmath8  km for the stellar radius and @xmath9  gauss for the stellar magnetic field strength .    another major feature in this paper is the relaxing of the assumption that all curvature radiation has been converted into e@xmath5 pairs as in the previous studies . in fact , by letting trace amount of the curvature radiation , which is emitted far away from the star , to survive and escape , we can obtain better fitting curves for the phase - resolved spectra of the crab pulsar , especially in the phases of trailing wing 1 , bridge and leading wing 2 .    in section  [ section : lightcurve ] , we review briefly the emission geometry in the magnetosphere . then we discuss the location of the inner boundary of the outer gap and produce the light curve for the crab pulsar . in section  [ section :",
    "spectra ] , we discuss the electric field component along the magnetic field lines and the three major emission mechanisms , namely synchrotron radiation , inverse compton scattering and curvature radiation . we argue that although most of the primary curvature photons have been converted to secondary pairs to produce synchrotron photons , some curvature photons which are emitted far away from the star can survive the cascade process and escape .",
    "they contribute to the peak in the high energy regime at several gev of the phases trailing wing 1 , bridge and leading wing 2 . in the final section ,",
    "we conclude our results and discuss briefly about the justification of our assumptions .",
    "to calculate the light curves and the spectra , we adopt the rotating dipole field in the magnetosphere . for a rotating dipole ,",
    "the local magnetic field @xmath10 is given by @xcite @xmath11-\\left(\\frac{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\mu$}}{r^3}+\\frac{\\dot{\\mbox { \\boldmath$\\mu$}}}{cr^2}+\\frac{\\ddot{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\mu$}}}{c^2r}\\right),\\nonumber \\label{eq : br}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the magnetic moment vector , @xmath13 is the radial unit vector and @xmath14 is the inclination angle .",
    "we calculate the polar cap edge by using @xmath15 as the initial trial values for the computer program .",
    "@xmath16 is the polar cap radius of an aligned static dipole where @xmath17 is the stellar radius and @xmath18 is the radius of the light cylinder .",
    "@xmath19 is the azimuthal angle about the magnetic axis .",
    "we call it the polar cap angle .",
    "then we employ the runge - kutta method to trace out the field lines . in subsequent iterations",
    ", we try to find the scaling factors , @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 correspond to the footprints of the last closed field lines , i.e.  the boundary of the polar cap . in figure  2 of @xcite",
    ", they have shown that @xmath20 is @xmath19-dependent .",
    "the polar cap of a rotating dipole is not circular in shape especially for those having large inclination angles",
    ". a three - dimensional view of the last closed field lines is shown in figure  [ fig:3d ] .",
    "next we define another scaling factor @xmath22 to denote the footprints of the open field lines as @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 represents the magnetic pole and @xmath25 represents the last closed field lines .",
    "since the star is rotating , aberration occurs along the line of sight . with @xmath26",
    ", we have @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the emission direction in the co - rotating and observer frames , respectively . choosing the rotational axis as the @xmath33-axis , in the observer frame , the polar angle from the rotational axis is given by @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the viewing angle with @xmath36 when the star is viewed directly above its rotational axis and @xmath37 when the star is viewed over the stellar equator .    comparing to the photons emitted at the centre of the star , a photon emitted at any particular location",
    "@xmath38 will take less time to travel to the light cylinder .",
    "the phase difference due to the travel time is given by @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we have the phase angle @xmath40 in the observer frame @xcite to be given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the azimuthal angle in the observer frame .",
    "choosing - plane to be the @xmath43-@xmath33 plane , @xmath44 is the length of the projection of @xmath45 on the @xmath43-@xmath46 plane .",
    "we would like to remark that we assume the dipole field in the corotating frame . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite assumed the rotating dipole field in the observer frame . with the difference in the magnetic field configuration in the observer frame , the emission direction near",
    "the light cylinder is azimuthal direction for the present case and nearly radial for the case in @xcite .",
    "essentially , this difference appears because the poloidal magnetic field dominates the toroidal field near the light cylinder in the observer frame for the present case , and the poloidal and the toroidal fields are comparable to each other for the case in @xcite .",
    "although there is a large difference in emission direction near the ligh cylinder , the pulse profiles do not change very much @xcite because the radiation very close to the light cylinder mainly contribute to the bridge phase . as we will see later , however",
    ", the calculated phase - resolved spectra in the present case explain the observations better than the results in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the present results suggest that the radiation diretion near the light cylinder seem to be in the azimuthal direction rather than in the radial direction .",
    "recent particle simulation for the global structure of the charge separated magnetosphere done by @xcite also indicated such behavior of the emission direction . on the other hand , the time - dependent force free relativistic mhd solution obtained by @xcite indicated the radial motion of the particles near the light cylinder . furthermore bucciantini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have considered a more general relativistic mhd approach for rotating pulsars and their solutions asymptotically approach the force - free ones similar to that obtained by @xcite in the high magnetized wind case , which is closed to our case .",
    "therefore the global structure of the magnetic field is still an open question .    in this paper",
    ", we neglect the contribution from the inward emissions with the following reasons . in general , since the charged particles accelerate only within the gap and they lose energy during the cascade process , the incoming charged particles and hence the incoming photons can not have an energy exceeding @xmath47 which is the energy of a charged particle immediately after it leaves the gap .",
    "@xmath48 is the local lorentz factor of the charged particle upon leaving the outer gap ( cf .  equation  [ eq : gammae ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "charged particles within the gap are being accelerated continuously and will gain an energy of @xmath49 with @xmath50 v @xcite where @xmath51 is the average value of the local gap size at @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , we can roughly estimate the ratio of the intensity of the radiation due to the incoming photons to the radiation due to the outgoing photons by @xmath53 . as a result ,",
    "when we compute the light curve , we neglect the contribution from the incoming photons .    by considering the radiation to be emitted tangent to the magnetic field lines in the co - rotating frame , we project the radiating points onto the @xmath54 plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : pattern ] shows the photon emission pattern for the inclination angle @xmath55 and @xmath56 . here",
    "we assume the emission region to extend from the stellar surface to the light cylinder and assume a symmetry between the north and the south poles .",
    "in other words , when there is a photon emitting with @xmath57 from the north pole , there is another photon emitting with @xmath58 from the south pole as well . in figure  [ fig : pattern ] , the grey lines correspond to the outgoing photons emitted from the north pole , the pole which is making an acute angle with the rotational axis .",
    "the black lines correspond to the outgoing photons emitted from the south pole .",
    "for example , for an observer at a viewing angle smaller than @xmath59 , the emission region by the north pole ( grey ) corresponds to the radiation emitted in the region between the inner boundary ( stellar surface ) and the null charge surface , and the emission region by the south pole ( black ) corresponds to the radiation emitted in the region beyond the null charge surface .",
    "the viewing angle which is the angle between the observer and the rotational axis can be set at a certain value @xmath60 .",
    "then we can measure the number of photons traveling in this @xmath60 direction and produce a theoretical light curve . however , before we move on to produce the theoretical light curve , we need to mention that the radiation is , in fact , emitted within a finite emission cone of half - angle @xmath61 instead of simply tangent to the field lines .",
    "the criteria for counting a photon becomes @xmath62 .",
    "this effect can be understood in a geometrical point of view .",
    "figure  [ fig : sin_beta ] shows a close - up illustration of two field lines that approximate two concentric circles .",
    "@xmath63 is the local thickness of the outer gap , @xmath64 is the local radius of curvature of the field line and @xmath65 is the pair creation mean free path .",
    "according to figure  [ fig : sin_beta ] , since the secondary pairs are produced just above the outer boundary of the outer gap accelerator , we can estimate the pitch angle of the new born pairs as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the fractional gap thickness defined by @xmath68 .",
    "the self - sustained outer gap model of @xcite estimated the fractional gap thickness as @xmath69 which is @xmath70 for the crab pulsar and @xmath71 for the vela pulsar . by considering the conservation of magnetic flux along a field line , with 1-d approximation , @xmath72 @xcite . since @xmath73 in static dipole approximation , @xmath74 .      as the electrodynamical studies have shown @xcite , the inner boundary of the outer gap accelerator",
    "is shifted inwards from the null charge surface with an increase in the current through the gap .",
    "in fact , if there is no current injection from the inner and the outer boundaries , the inner boundary will be located at a position on which @xmath75 is satisfied , where @xmath76 is the current density in unit of @xmath77 carried by the pairs created in the gap and is constant along the field line for the steady state @xcite .",
    "for example , if no current is created in the gap ( @xmath78 ) , the inner boundary is located at the position where @xmath79 is satisfied , that is , on the null charge surface . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath80 on a particular magnetic field line , the inner boundary on the field line is located at the stellar surface , where @xmath81 is satisfied .",
    "we expect that the created current density is proportional to the pair - creation rate , which depends on the radial distance as @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "since most of the pairs are created around the null charge surface in the outer gap , we may be able to relate the created current density with the radial distance to the null charge surface of each last closed field line as @xmath83^{-3/8}$ ] , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are , respectively , the created current density on and the radial distance to the null charge surface on the last closed field line with the polar cap angle @xmath86 .",
    "we know the location of the inner boundary with the azimuthal angle if we would estimate the created current density @xmath84 . as demonstrated by the electrodynamical studies , however , the current structure in the gap is very sensitive to the gap geometry such as trans - field thickness and the longitudinal width . since the gap geometry in the pulsar magnetosphere should be determined by the global condition @xcite and since there is no study for the 3-dimensional magnetosphere of an inclined rotator , we deal with the created current @xmath84 by using some model parameters",
    ". figure  [ fig : inner ] summarizes the variation of the radial distances to the inner boundary and the null charge surface on the last closed field lines against the polar cap angle of the field lines around the magnetic axis . from figure",
    "[ fig : inner ] , we can see that only a small current is created around @xmath87 , so the outer gap must be less active there . in this paper , we constrain the width of the polar cap angle with the field lines on which the pair creation mean - free path , @xmath88^{1/2}\\sim 2 f^{1/2}(r_l/2)r$ ] , at the null charge surface of the active field lines is estimated to be shorter than @xmath52 .",
    "this condition produces an azimuthal extension of the outer gap of @xmath89 .    for the outer boundary",
    ", the position should be determined with the global model such as @xcite with current . for the present local model ,",
    "the position is a free parameter and we put it at the light cylinder because we assume that the emissivity of the curvature radiation is declined rapidly near / beyond the light cylinder and/or the radiations beyond the light cylinder are beamed out of line of sight due to the magnetic bending .",
    "we may put the outer boundary inside of the light cylinder .",
    "however , the resultant pulse profile and the spectra does not change very much unless the outer boundary is located close to the null charge surface , because the accelerated particles inside of the gap contribute to the total radiation emission outside the outer gap @xcite .      since the general feature of the light curve such as the standing phase of the pulse is mainly affected by the geometry of the emission regions , we produce a theoretical light curve by assuming constant emissivity .",
    "figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] shows the theoretical light curve for a pulsar with the inclination angle @xmath90 , @xmath56 , viewing angle @xmath91 and the azimuthal extension of the outer gap @xmath92 .",
    "the pitch angle at @xmath52 is treated as a fitting parameter and is assumed to be @xmath93 .",
    "these parameters are chosen so that the modeled light curve explains the general features of the observation such as two peaks in a single period with a phase separation of @xmath94 between the two peaks .",
    "the breakdown of the light curve to show the contribution from the two poles separately is given in figure  [ fig : lightcurvepoles ] .",
    "the color scheme is the same as the one for the emission pattern in figure  [ fig : pattern ] . as we shall see later , the inclination angle and the viewing angle chosen to explain the observed light curve also produces phase - resolved spectra which are consistent with observation",
    "we adopt the local electric field equation in the chr model for the region beyond the null charge surface . by assuming that the local electric field is decreasing in a quadratic form for the region between the null charge surface @xmath95 and the inner boundary of pair production region @xmath96 , we have @xmath97 } { \\left[\\left(\\frac{r_{\\rm null}}{r_{\\rm in}}\\right)^2 - 1\\right ] } & r < r_{\\rm null}. \\end{array}\\right . \\label{eq : er}\\ ] ] for @xmath98 , @xmath99 is the vacuum solution given in @xcite .",
    "the vacuum solution is a good approximation for pulsars with thin gaps like the crab pulsar .",
    "the radial distance @xmath100 to the null charge surface varies with the field lines and the local curvature radius also depends on the field lines .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , the electric field component along a magnetic field is a function of both the radial distance @xmath100 and the polar cap angle @xmath19 , that is , @xmath101 .",
    "when a relativistic charged particle which is accelerated continuously along a magnetic field line by the strong local electric field radiates by means of curvature radiation , the power gained by the accelerated particle as it goes through the electric potential , @xmath102 , is transformed to the power radiated as curvature radiation in order to maintain the equilibrium .",

    "the pulse of the crab pulsar is divided into 8 phases , namely leading wing 1 , peak 1 , trailing wing 1 , bridge , leading wing 2 , peak 2 , trailing wing 2 and off pulse .",
    "the criteria for the division is listed in table  [ table : kuiper ] .",
    "we choose the azimuthal angle of @xmath195 from the @xmath196-@xmath197 plane to be phase zero .",
    "the footprints corresponding to each phase are plotted for both poles in figure  [ fig : nspoles ] .",
    "although our prediction is not too good ( for example , in lw1 , the peak at about @xmath0  mev can not be produced ; whereas in p2 and tw2 , the peaks at about @xmath0  mev are much too high ) , most of the spectral features can be explained .",
    "however , it has been argued that the north pole and the south pole need not to be perfectly symmetric .",
    "since the dipole may not be at the centre of the star , just like the sunspot geometry @xcite , it is possible that the two poles could have small differences . furthermore , @xmath198 is calculated according to a simple static dipolar field , which is clearly not a good approximation in the outer magnetosphere of a realistic rotating dipolar field with current flow . in the best fit",
    ", we thus allow the gap sizes to be different for the two poles and the pitch angles to vary for individual phases .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the comparison between the observed data of the phase - resolved spectra of the crab pulsar and the theoretical best fitting results .",
    "table  [ table : fitting ] summarizes the values of @xmath199 and @xmath198 for different phases for each pole .",
    "we find that the fitting pitch angles for the phases consisting of field lines at a polar angle closer to @xmath86 are smaller , while those for the phases consisting of field lines at a polar angle closer to @xmath200 are larger .",
    "this agrees with the theory that the outer gap is thinner around @xmath86 and thicker around @xmath200 .",
    "as we consider the emission region to extend inwards to an inner boundary inside the null charge surface , we can fit the spectrum of lw1 .",
    "this can not be done in @xcite which considered the emission region to be from null charge surface to light cylinder alone , i.e.  one pole only .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows that this phase is mainly contributed by the radiation from the north pole .",
    "another phase that can not be produced in @xcite is tw2 . @xcite",
    "estimated @xmath201 , but in section  [ section : azimuth_width ] , we estimated that @xmath202 can be @xmath203 for the extended new emission geometry .",
    "the widening of the azimuthal extension of the outer gap allows us to obtain a reasonable fitting for the phase tw2 .    from figure",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , we can see that except lw1 and the @xmath0 mev regime of p1 , all the phase - resolved spectra are dominated by the radiation from the south pole .",
    "in general , the spectra are mainly contributed by the part from the null charge surface to the light cylinder , so the results in @xcite are good approximations .",
    "the peaks at the high energy regime near several gev in tw1 , bridge and lw2 are believed to be the survival curvature radiation emitted at locations far away from the star ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : phi_r ] ) .",
    "this agrees with the model that most of the curvature radiation has been converted into e@xmath5 pairs and then emitted as synchrotron and inverse compton scattering photons .    for the 3 phases between the peaks , i.e.  in the middle row of figure  [ fig : spectra ] , namely tw1 , bridge and lw2 , the synchrotron peaks from the south pole are much wider than their counterparts from the north pole .",
    "in fact , they show a kind of double - peak feature with a plateau around @xmath191 mev . according to figure  [ fig : phi_r ] , the radiation of each of these 3 phases",
    "are actually emitted from two well - separated regions .",
    "for tw1 , the radiation is emitted from an outer region around @xmath204 and an inner region around @xmath205 . for bridge , they are @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "for lw2 , they are @xmath208 and @xmath209 . in order to know more clearly this feature ,",
    "we plot a further decomposed phase - resolved spectra for tw1 , bridge and lw2 in figure  [ fig : bridge_decompose ] . in figure  [ fig : bridge_decompose ] , we decompose each blue line in figure  [ fig : spectra ] into two components .",
    "the green lines represent the radiation coming from the outer emission region and the magenta lines represent those from the inner region .    from figure",
    "[ fig : bridge_decompose ] , we can notice that the radiation emitted at a larger @xmath100 , i.e.  from the outer region , will produce a synchrotron peak at a lower energy .",
    "this can be explained by the typical synchrotron photon energy given in equation  ( [ eq : esyn ] ) with @xmath210 .",
    "let us take the bridge as an example .",
    "we choose the representative @xmath100 to be the midpoint of the emission region from figure  [ fig : phi_r ] , i.e.  @xmath211 for the outer region and @xmath212 for the inner region . in this case",
    ", the ratio of @xmath100 is about @xmath213 and hence the characteristic @xmath214 of the inner region is about @xmath215 times that of the outer region . from the modelled fit ,",
    "the ratio of the peaks is about @xmath216 .",
    "therefore , the theory matches quite well with the observation in this case .",
    "we have used the modified three dimensional outer magnetosphere gap model with the inner boundary of the outer gap being extended from the null charge surface to near the stellar surface .",
    "the exact location of the inner boundary does not affect the fitting results .",
    "the  inwardly - extended \" part of the outer gap contributes to lw1 and tw2 of the light curve with a slight modification of p1 and p2 .",
    "such modified outer gap geometry also plays a vital role in explaining the optical polarization properties of the crab pulsar @xcite .",
    "together with the results of @xcite on the gap accelerator , this model explains the pulse profile , phase - resolved spectra and polarization of the crab pulsar .",
    "also , the outer gap model can explain the observed complex morphology change of light curve as a function of the photon energy @xcite .",
    "four adjustable parameters are used to simulate the light curve : the inclination angle of the magnetic axis to the rotational axis @xmath14 , @xmath22 , the viewing angle also to the rotational axis @xmath35 and the emission cone pitch angle due to geometry of the emission location @xmath198 .",
    "as constrained by the phase separation of the double peaks , we choose the values @xmath90 and @xmath217 . from radio observations , @xcite estimated @xmath218 with @xmath35 unknown . by using the polarimetric observations at frequencies between @xmath219 and @xmath220 ghz , @xcite calculated @xmath221 and @xmath222",
    "therefore , further observations is required in order to determine these two parameters more accurately .",
    "for the photon spectra , our model fitting requires @xmath223 , which is larger than the theoretical estimation ( @xmath224 ) by a factor of @xmath225 .",
    "however , the theory @xcite has assumed a vacuum dipole potential .",
    "it has been pointed out that in order to explain the observed radiation power on high energy region , current must flow in the accelerator and hence the potential at the gap will be reduced @xcite .",
    "consequently , the gap size with current flow should be larger than the vacuum one .",
    "moreover , we have taken the stellar radius of a neutron star to be @xmath226 cm . due to the lack of a direct method to determine the size of a neutron star @xcite , and the equation of state inside a neutron star given by different theoretical models",
    "do not provide a unanimous value for the neutron star size , we can only determine the magnetic moment , i.e.  @xmath227 , of the pulsar from the energy loss rate .",
    "however , although the dipole radiation comes from the spin down power of the star , it is not all of it .",
    "for example , the vacuum formula of the dipole radiation for the aligned rotator is usually used to infer the dipole moment of the pulsar . on the other hand",
    ", mhd solution @xcite suggested that the effect of the current increases the spindown luminosity from the the vacuum formula .",
    "therefore , we may have overestimated the value of the magnetic moment and therefore the strength of the magnetic field . since @xmath228 hence @xmath227 , the synchrotron peak may have been overestimated .",
    "similarly , the peak synchrotron flux @xmath229 may also be overestimated . since the power of synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering can be compared by the ratio of the local magnetic energy density and the photon energy density , @xmath230 which is independent of @xmath227 shows that @xmath231 may not be affected . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath232 may have been overestimated , @xmath233 should be smaller . hence less curvature photons should be absorbed .",
    "the crab pulsar is one of the most important pulsars because of its close distance and strong radiation signals in all frequencies .",
    "although observation data of it have been gathered for about 40 years , the underlying physics involved in this pulsar are not completely understood .",
    "for example , the structure of the charged particle accelerator in the magnetosphere can be different in the polar cap model , the outer gap model and the newly proposed caustic model @xcite which proposed a two pole model with the thin gap regions starting from each polar cap to the light cylinder .",
    "we hope that further observation by the more sensitive satellites in the future missions , e.g.  glast , can bring more crucial and critical information so that we can determine the mechanisms that are truly taking place .",
    "for example , as shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] , we predict that there is a clear component ( @xmath234 mev - @xmath234 gev ) , which is mainly dominated by the survival curvature photons , in tw1 , bridge and lw2 .",
    "our model also suggests that the high energy turn over in tw1 , bridge and lw2 is @xmath235 gev , whereas the high energy turn over of lw1 is only @xmath236 mev ( much lower than the other phases ) .",
    "this difference results from the consequence of the radiation in lw1 being emitted from a different pole in the region between the inner boundary and the null charge surface , where the local electric field is much weaker ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ eq : er ] ) . with an increase in sensitivity and a widening of the energy range than egret , glast may be able to confirm our predictions .",
