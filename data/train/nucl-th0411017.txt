    "the pairing is the most important correlation beyond the independent particle approximation in the nuclear mean field @xcite . for the description of nuclei close to the beta stability line ,",
    "the bcs approximation has been successfully employed in order to take into account the pair correlation .",
    "although this approximation does not treat the interplay between the particle - hole and the pairing channels in a fully consistent manner @xcite , one can expect that the defect is minor in well bound nuclei .",
    "as the fermi energy approaches to zero , however , virtual scattering of nucleon pairs to the positive energy spectra may significantly alter the situation .",
    "if the continuum states acquire an appreciable occupation probability , in the bcs approximation , the particle density does not tend to zero asymptotically . in this case , the unphysical particle gas surrounding the nucleus appears @xcite , and one has to use the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method @xcite , which is theoretically more robust than the bcs approximation .",
    "recently , sandulescu _ et al .",
    "_ have argued that the non - resonant part of the single particle continuum spectra can be neglected in the pairing correlation @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "since the wave function for a resonance state is well localized inside the nucleus , the unphysical particle gas is negligible if the non - resonant part is excluded from the positive energy space . by taking only a few narrow resonance states into account , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the bcs approximation leads to similar results to the hfb method concerning the binding energy as well as the root mean square radius both for stable and weakly bound nuclei .    those results ,",
    "however , do not necessarily mean that the bcs approximation provides a good representation for quasi - particle wave functions .",
    "in fact , dobaczewski _ et al . _ have shown @xcite that the smaller part of the two component quasi - particle wave functions in the bcs approximation behaves quite differently from that obtained with the hfb method , although the larger component is similar to each other .",
    "since transitions are usually more sensitive to the details of wave function than energies , a more intriguing test of the bcs approximation should be for quasi - particle wave functions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss how the bcs approximation can be improved while retaining its intuitive picture . to this end",
    ", we start from the full hfb equations and simplify them by the bcs approximation .",
    "we then propose a model which treats the effect beyond the bcs approximation by the perturbation theory .",

    "surprisingly , the quasi - particle energy is off only by 0.04 mev at most in the bcs approximation , and the approximation seems to work well as long as the quasi - particle energy is concerned .",
    "this is in accordance with the finding in refs .",

    "@xcite , the smaller component of the wave function in the bcs approximation is inconsistent with the hfb wave function .",
    "notice , however , that the perturbative method p - hfb dramatically improves the radial dependence of the wave function , suggesting that the bcs approximation still provides a good starting point to begin with . for the larger component , although the difference between the hfb and the bcs wave functions is small ( but see below for the wave function for the 1g@xmath58 state ) , the perturbation again improves the shape of the wave function in a consistent way .",

    "4 compares the occupation probability for the @xmath46 states obtained by the hfb method ( the solid line ) , the bcs approximation ( the dotted line ) and the perturbative approach , p - hfb ( the dashed line ) .",
    "again , the p - hfb well reproduces the result of the hfb method .",
    "notice that the occupation probability for the 3@xmath46 state at the hf energy of @xmath593.16 mev is much larger than that in the bcs approximation , which essentially leads to a zero occupation probability for this state . the unperturbed quasi - particle energy , i.e.",
    ", the quasi - particle energy in the bcs approximation , for this state ( 3@xmath46 ) is 3.66 mev , which is close to the quasi - particle energy for the 1@xmath46 state ( 3.73 mev ) .",
    "therefore , according to the perturbation theory , these two states strongly couple to each other by the off - diagonal components of the pairing potential .",
    "the wave functions for these two states are plotted in fig .",
    "5 . indeed , the shape of the wave functions are similar to each other . in the hfb theory ,",
    "hole states appear as narrow resonance states when the quasi - particle energy is larger than @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the width of the hfb resonance states of this kind originates from the coupling between the hole and the particle states due to the off - diagonal components of the pairing potential .",
    "namely , the particle states which have a similar quasi - particle energy as the hole state in the bcs approximation participate in the resonance state so that the quasi - particle wave functions behave similarly between the hole and the particle states within the resonance width@xcite .    this important mechanism of the particle - hole couplings is missing in the bcs approximation . note that the 3@xmath46 state is a non - resonant continuum state in the absence of the pairing . the resonance bcs method ,",
    "therefore , is not expected to be adequate in the circumstance where details of wave function plays an important role , for instance in the calculation of a strength function with the quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) @xcite .",
    "within the mean - field approach , the pairing correlation is best incorporated with the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method .",
    "this method consistently takes into account the couplings between the particle - hole and the particle - particle channels , and thus theoretically robust .",
    "this method , however , is somewhat cumbersome to solve , and the application of the fully continuum hfb calculation has been limited only to spherical systems so far .",
    "the hfb method , being based on the independent quasi - particle approximation , also abandons a simple and intuitive single - particle picture . in this paper , we have developed a perturbative model to the hfb method , which provides an intuitive connection between the hfb and the bcs methods , and at the same time which can be solved much easier than the hfb . applying the perturbative approach to weakly bound nuclei",
    ", we have found that the lowest order perturbation reproduces well the results of the hfb method both for the quasi - particle energy and the radial dependence of wave function .",
    "this suggests that the bcs approximation provides good unperturbative states , although it leads to inconsistent quasi - particle wave functions with the hfb wave functions , especially for the smaller component . as good as the self - consistent hfb calculation",
    ", one may thus take into account the many - body pairing correlation by using the perturbative model on top of the bcs approximation after the convergence of the bcs calculation is achieved .",
    "this scheme might be easily applied to deformed nuclei for which the self - consitent hfb calculation is very dufficult .",
    "we have also pointed out that non - resonant scattering states in a mean - field potential can gain an appreciable occupation probability when there is a weakly bound single particle state close to the fermi energy . this important coupling effect between particle and hole states",
    "can not be incorporated in the bcs approximation . evidently , the bcs approximation is inadequate for the qrpa calculations in weakly bound nuclei , where the details of the quasi - particle wave functions play an essential role .",
