    "the predicted disc temperature profile is @xmath1 at @xmath2 , where @xmath3 with @xmath4 the black hole mass and @xmath5  the quasar s bolometric luminosity relative to its eddington luminosity .",
    "the corresponding prediction for the variation of the half - light radius with wavelength is @xmath6 for a broad range of wavelengths .",
    "quasar accretion disc half - light radii can be inferred using observations of gravitationally lensed quasars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy causes the flux ratios of the lensed images to deviate from the predictions of models with smooth mass distributions .",
    "the amplitude of these deviations depends on the size of the emission region at the wavelength being observed relative to the typical einstein radius of the lensing stars .",
    "observationally , it has been found that quasar accretion discs have _ microlensing sizes _ ( inferred from microlensing observations ) which are larger than the _ theory sizes _",
    "@xcite predicted from theory given each quasar s estimated black hole mass and assuming accretion at the eddington rate , 10% accretion efficiency and an average disc inclination to the line of sight of 60@xmath7 .",
    "in the three studies to date with sample sizes of ten or more objects , the microlensing sizes range from a factor of @xmath8 higher on average at mean rest - frame wavelength 2660  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m10 ) to a factor of @xmath9 @xcite to @xmath10 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b11 ) higher on average at mean rest - frame wavelength 1736 .",
    "the above results show that microlensing sizes are larger than theory sizes at only marginal significance ( assuming accretion at the eddington limit , which may be an overestimate ; see @xcite ) .",
    "however , microlensing sizes are significantly larger than quasar _ flux sizes _ ( m10 ) .",
    "flux sizes are found by determining how large a standard disc would need to be to generate the specific luminosity corresponding to the observed magnification - corrected flux of the quasar at a given wavelength .",
    "m10 find that microlensing sizes are @xmath11 times larger than flux sizes .",

    "as for the wavelength dependence of quasar half - light radii , the microlensing sizes in the study of b11 are very weakly dependent on wavelength in ten of eleven cases studied , implying in the simplest case a temperature profile steeply decreasing with radius at temperatures that generate ultraviolet emission . on average , b11 finds @xmath12 with @xmath13 ( quoting random and systematic errors ) , where @xmath14 is predicted by theory .",
    "the results of b11 contrast with studies of individual objects which have generally found results consistent with the theoretical prediction : @xmath15 for he 1104@xmath161805 @xcite ; @xmath17 for mg 0414 + 0534 @xcite , as compared to @xmath18 for that object in b11 ; @xmath19 for he 0435@xmath161223 @xcite , as compared to @xmath20 for that object in b11 ; @xmath21 for q 2237 + 0305 ; @xmath22 for sbs 0909 + 532 @xcite ; and @xmath23 at 94% confidence for sdss j0924 + 0219 @xcite , as compared to @xmath24 for that object in b11 .",
    "further studies of microlensed quasars are clearly needed @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , investigation of possible explanations for unexpectedly large sizes and nonstandard temperature profiles in quasar accretion discs is warranted .",
    "to summarize : there is marginal evidence that quasar accretion discs are larger than their theory sizes ( though the evidence strengthens if quasars are not typically accreting at the eddington limit ) , considerable evidence that they are larger than their flux sizes , and possible evidence that their half - light radii have a different wavelength dependence than that predicted by theory . as discussed in m10 , a complication to the latter issue is that reconciling the three size measurements may require _ flatter _ temperature profiles ( @xmath25 ) and thus a steeper size - wavelength relation ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the two constraints are not necessarily contradictory ; a nonmonotonic temperature profile can be locally steep yet effectively flat overall .",
    "if the correct temperature profile and physical parameters are used , theory sizes and flux sizes should agree with each other and with the microlensing sizes and the observed wavelength dependence of the sizes should match that predicted by the temperature profile .",
    "other options discussed in m10 to help explain the three discrepant size measurements include low accretion efficiency for unobscured quasars or increasing the apparent disc size through contamination by line emission arising on larger physical scales or through scattering ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also ) .",
    "for example , a large fraction of the disc continuum could be intercepted by a strongly warped disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in that case ,",
    "the half - light radius will increase with a wavelength dependence related to the disc albedo , as radiation not scattered by the disc will be absorbed and reradiated at the local equilibrium temperature ( which will be lower than the characteristic temperature of the continuum emission from smaller radii ) .",
    "disc sizes also increase with eddington ratio , so super - eddington accretion may also help explain discrepant size measurements .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have suggested that the steep temperature profile found by b11 arises from the formation of a scattering photosphere in gas outflowing from the inner regions of an accretion disc undergoing super - eddington accretion ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the small size of the x - ray emitting regions in quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) could be explained in their model if the outflowing gas forms a compton - thick funnel - shaped wind and photosphere , so that quasars are only visible within the cone of the funnel because the funnel obscures both the x - ray and uv continuum source regions when viewed from other angles .    another possible explanation for the temperature profiles found by b11 may arise from changes to an accretion disc resulting from misalignment of its initial angular momentum vector and the angular momentum vector of a spinning black hole .",
    "any material in the vicinity of a massive spinning object experiences a precession induced by the frame dragging due to the object @xcite .",
    "the result of this precession , known as the lense - thirring effect , on a misaligned disc around the object is that each individual ring in the disc will precess at different rate , warping the disc .",
    "@xcite showed that the discs around spinning black holes evolve in such a way that in the final configuration the disc is warped , with the orbital angular momentum of the inner region either aligned or anti - aligned with the spin axis of the black hole while the disc s outer region remains unperturbed .",
    "warped - disc dynamics has been the subject of extensive research ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in several recent papers , nixon and colleagues have suggested that the inner regions of inclined discs could evolve by tearing apart instead of smoothly warping .",
    "* hereafter nkpf ) showed that for realistic parameters , the inner region of randomly oriented accretion discs around a spinning black hole will tear , due to the lense - thirring effect . if the angle between the outer disc and the black hole spin is in the range @xmath27 , the misalignment between the inner edge of the outer disc and the annulus ( of width @xmath28 ) torn off it will be @xmath29 after half a precession period .",
    "the rotational velocities of those gas parcels will then be partially opposed , leading to cancellation of angular momentum and rapid infall ( see * ? ? ?",
    "nkpf suggested that , given the smallness of the misalignment angle upper limit for avoiding disc tearing ( of order a few degrees ) , the effect should be common in accretion around the supermassive black holes that power quasars .    when gas in a precessing annulus torn from a disc intersects with gas in an annulus still connected to the disc , the intersecting gas will be collisionally heated .",
    "high - temperature gas in intersection regions at relatively large distances from the central black hole can in principle help explain the large , relatively wavelength - independent half - light radii inferred for quasar accretion discs . in addition , the wide range of behaviors possible in the torn disc model as a function of the initial disc - bh spin misalignment angle could in principle help explain the wide range of wavelength dependences in quasar accretion disc half - light radii @xcite .    in this paper",

    "the disc s spin axis is oriented at a random angle @xmath34 relative to the black hole spin axis",
    ".    the disc spreads inwards and different annuli in it precess at different rates due to the lense - thirring effect , so the disc warps as it spreads inwards .",
    "the disc eventually reaches a radius where viscous dissipation can not overcome the shear between adjacent annuli imposed by the lense - thirring effect .",
    "the innermost annulus of the disc then tears away from the rest of the disc and precesses independently .",
    "this annulus has width @xmath28 , where @xmath35 is the local disc height .",
    "there will be two contact points between the precessing annulus and the next innermost annulus ( which forms the inner edge of the outer disc ) . at these points gas from each annulus on intersecting orbits is likely to shock , converting some orbital motion to heat",
    ". the post - shock gas will be unable to remain in circular orbits at the intersection radius .",
    "the original nkpf picture consists of gas intersecting at angles up to @xmath36 .",
    "the disc tears at a break radius @xmath37 given by eq . 7 and eq .",
    "8 of nkpf : @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 instead of @xmath35 appears in the above equations because we use @xmath35 to refer to the disc scale height , whereas nkpf use it to refer to the disc thickness .",
    "gas which precesses and intersects at @xmath37 loses angular momentum , meaning that it can recircularize its orbit only at some circularization radius @xmath41 .",
    "@xcite give an approximate expression for @xmath42 ( their eq .",

    "the intersection angle between these annuli as a function of time , @xmath49 , is given by @xmath50 where the precession period is @xmath51 , with @xmath52 the lense - thirring precession frequency in degrees per unit time .",
    "at each intersection , each annulus approaches at an angle @xmath53 to their mutual bisector .",

    "if all this transverse kinetic energy is converted to heat , the resulting thermal energy is distributed among the same @xmath58 particles : @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the temperature increase of the gas .",

    "we therefore cap the value of @xmath64 at @xmath67  k.",
    "the temperature profile and sed of a torn disc ultimately depend on the disc / bh spin misalignment angle @xmath48 , the dimensionless bh spin parameter @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , the dimensionless viscosity parameter @xmath70 , the disc height to radial distance ratio @xmath71 , and the black hole mass @xmath4 and normalized mass accretion rate @xmath72 .",

    "if the results of b11 are borne out by further observations , a strong test of such simulations will be how naturally they can generate the temperature profiles allowed by observations .    alternatively , if future observations rule out the possibility that quasar accretion discs have flat temperature profiles , inhomogeneous accretion discs @xcite offer a potential solution to the discrepancy between microlensing and flux sizes .",
    "inhomogeneous discs simultaneously increase the radius within which emission at a given wavelength occurs ( increasing the microlensing size ) and decrease the area within that radius which emits at that wavelength ( increasing the flux size ) .",
