    "mankind has been dreaming to fly for centuries .",
    "however , the fundamental flying mechanism had not been understood until the pioneers of aerodynamics , such as kutta and joukowski @xcite , connected lift generation to the circulation of an airfoil in the steady sense . over the last several decades , in order to design high - performance micro aerial vehicles ( mavs ) , major research effort has been focused on unveiling the unsteady aerodynamic secrets of insects and birds that have demonstrated unrivaled maneuverability and agility .",
    "early researchers @xcite have attributed the high lift performance of the natural flyers to an attached leading edge vortex ( lev ) .",
    "later , numerous experimental investigations @xcite have been carried out to study the dynamics of the wake vortices as well as their effects on force generation for wings or airfoils undergoing unsteady motions , such as accelerating , pitching , flapping , etc .    for theoretical investigation ,",
    "inviscid potential flow together with vortex methods has been extensively applied to provide reduced flow model without solving the navier - stokes equation .",
    "for example , @xcite adopted a virtual coordinate frame to develop an unsteady framework for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) rotating flat plate and employed a single point vortex to emulate the effect of the lev .",
    "however , the single vortex was still modeled in a quasi - steady manner that the location and circulation of the vortex are fixed during the movement of the plate .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite modeled the wake using finite sets of point vortices with varying strengths and evolving locations .",
    "this resulted in significant improvement in capturing the unsteady features of the flow ; whereas the accuracy of the model is still limited , especially for cases with complex near - field wake patterns , due to the overly - reduced modeling of the vortical structures .",
    "an alternative approach is to fully represent the wake vortex sheets in a discretized sense , using either point vortices or vortex panels as demonstrated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . due to a relatively complete representation of all vortical structures in the wake ,",
    "the vortex - sheet approach generally yields promising accuracy ; however , the simulation becomes increasingly expensive as time proceeds . as a remedy",
    ", a vortex - amalgamation method @xcite has recently been proposed to effectively restrain the growth of the computational cost for large simulations .    in practice",
    ", our previous model @xcite for a 2d unsteady flat plate could be readily applied to the case of a rigid wing or airfoil with negligible thickness . however , the same extension might not be applicable for an airfoil as the model requires to establish an analytical mapping between the airfoil and a circle . although special solutions for certain types of airfoil could exist ( such as the joukowski airfoil ) , it is generally challenging to obtain such transformation for an arbitrary - shaped airfoil . to address this difficulty",
    ", the effect of the airfoil might be substituted by a closed vortex sheet coinciding with the surface of the airfoil , the framework of which is consistent with the boundary - element method @xcite . similar to the flow model for a flat plate , discretized vortex sheets could still be incorporated to account for the wake vortical structures shed from the leading and trailing edges of the airfoil , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : physical_flow_af ] .",
    "the essence of vortex - based flow models lies in the accurate predictions of the strength and distribution of the vortices in the flow field .",
    "since the time evolution of free vortical structures can be solved using the birkhoff - rott equation @xcite , the key problem to be addressed is how vorticity detaches from the surface of the solid body and enters the fluid . in reality",
    ", the generation of vorticity is related to the interaction between fluid and solid boundary that forms the shear layer , which is essentially the product of viscous effect . since the flow model is inviscid , a typical solution to that is applying vorticity releasing conditions at the vortex shedding locations of the solid body , e.g. the kutta condition at a sharp trailing edge .",
    "this means that all the viscous effects can be translated into a single condition @xcite that yields an estimation of the circulation around the body or the vorticity created near each vortex shedding location . for trailing edges",
    ", the classical kutta condition has been shown to be effective for steady background flows , thus it is also commonly known as the steady - state trailing - edge kutta condition which requires a finite velocity at the trailing edge @xcite . for a joukowski airfoil , the steady state kutta condition",
    "is realized by setting the trailing edge to be a stagnation point in the mapped circle plane .",
    "the effect of this implementation is that the stagnation streamline from the trailing edge will be tangential to the edge ( or bisect a finite - angle trailing edge ) , which is consistent with the physical flow near the trailing edge . for the case of a flat plate , this condition will guarantee the streamline emanating from this stagnation point to be inline with the plate , fulfilling the condition proposed in previous studies @xcite .",
    "however , the stagnation streamline for a finite - angle trailing edge is ambiguous @xcite , which causes great challenge to modeling the trailing - edge vortex sheet .    in this study , we employ discretized bound and free vortex sheets to model the unsteady flow around an airfoil .",
    "the flow field is given by solving the euler equation obtained by removing the viscous term in the navier - stokes equation .",
    "to this end , flow models based on the euler equation have difficulty in capturing viscous effects around and behind a moving object .",
    "the introduction of the vortex sheet could partially address this difficulty .",
    "physically , a vortex sheet represents a viscous shear layer in the euler limit , by letting the thickness of the shear layer approach zero ( section 2.2 of @xcite ) . from a kinematic perspective",
    ", this approximation would yield the solution to the inviscid flow outside the vortex sheet with the non - penetration boundary condition implemented at the fluid - solid interface .",
    "however , a vortex - sheet is inadequate to represent a viscous shear layer in the dynamic sense .",
    "this is because the vortex sheet only conserves the tangential velocity jump , which is also the circulation per unit length of the original shear layer .",
    "therefore , a vortex sheet does not resolve the velocity gradient across the sheet ; neither does it account for the mass and momentum associated with the shear layer , nor the fluid entrained by the shear layer . to this end ,",
    "a vortex - sheet based flow model is likely to capture the force contributions from circulation , i.e. lift and pressure drag , but not the viscous drag which is closely related to the momentum balance of the viscous shear layer . in order to properly capture other viscous effects , such as entrainment , viscous drag , or even energy dissipation , we propose a generalized sheet with superimposed quantities and discontinuities associated with the original shear layer . in this way",
    ", the original vortex sheet could be extended to represent a general shear layer at the fluid - fluid or fluid - solid interfaces for single and multiple phase flows .    as seen in this manuscript , application of proper boundary conditions and standard conservation laws to this model",
    "allows for the calculation of correct wall - bounded vortex sheet as well as the free vortex sheet released at the trailing edge of an airfoil .",
    "the proposed generalized sheet model enables the application of the conservation laws of mass and momentum for a system of triple - joint vortex sheets and surrounding flow .",
    "the result will be applied to a particular case , which is the finite - angle trailing edge of an airfoil where two incoming bound vortex sheets on the airfoil surface join together to form the free vortex sheet . together with the unsteady kutta condition and the conservation of circulation , one obtains a general analytical condition to determine the angle , strength , and relative velocity of the trailing - edge vortex sheet .",
    "the framework of the flow model for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) airfoil is not fundamentally different from that for a 2d flat plate wing @xcite . in both situations ,",
    "potential flow is applied as the governing equation , which is based on solving the navier - stokes equation in the eulerian limit .",
    "this has two main advantages : one is analytical representation of the entire flow field , the other is saving computational cost since the domain of interest is reduced from the entire flow field to only finite vortical structures .    assuming that the rigid - body motion of the airfoil in a quiescent environment can be decomposed into a translational motion of velocity @xmath0 and a rotational motion of angular velocity @xmath1 .",
    "both the translational and the rotational motions can be incorporated into the boundary condition at the solid - fluid interface .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : physical_flow_af ] , flow separation near the leading edge and at the sharp trailing edge of the airfoil causes the formation of two free vortex sheets in the wake . in a cartesian coordinate system with the origin fixed at the rotation center ,",
    "the complex potential of the flow around an airfoil with angle of attack , @xmath2 , can be formulated as @xmath3   + \\underbrace{\\vphantom{\\int } w_b(z , t)}_{\\text{body term } } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the complex position , @xmath5 is the curve length between the separation point and a vortex element along a vortex sheet , @xmath6 represents the total length of an entire vortex sheet , and @xmath7 is the vortex sheet strength ( circulation per unit length ) .",
    "the subscripts @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the properties associated with the leading - edge and trailing - edge vortex sheets , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath10 represents the flow induced by the body motion of the airfoil , and is usually associated with the so - called ` bound vortex ' .",
    "therefore , the ` bound vortex ' can be viewed as a substitute for the solid body so that the non - penetration boundary condition can still be satisfied at the fluid - solid interface while the solid body is removed from the flow model .",
    "again , we note here that the ` body term ' or the ` bound vortex ' implicitly accounts for the effects of translation , rotation , or deformation , and more details will be provided in section  [ sec:3 ] . in general , ` bound vortex ' can be realized by placing image vortices inside the solid body for a joukowski airfoil or a flat plate , where the strength and location of the image vortices can be first decided from milne - thomson s circle theorem @xcite in the circle plane and then mapped back to the physical plane .",
    "however , for an arbitrarily - shaped airfoil which can not be easily mapped to a circle , an analytical solution for @xmath10 is not available . in this case , the ` bound vortex ' can be realized by placing a bound vortex sheet along the surface of the airfoil as shown in figure  [ fig : physical_flow_af ] , and @xmath10 becomes @xmath11 where the subscript @xmath12 denotes the properties associated with the bound vortex sheet .",
    "note here that @xmath5 for the bound vortex sheet starts from the trailing edge with a counter - clockwise direction .",
    "now , combining equations  ( [ eq : cplxpotential_af0 ] ) and  ( [ eq : cplxpotential_af1 ] ) and taking the derivative @xmath13 , we obtain the complex - conjugate velocity field , @xmath14 , in the form @xmath15 . \\end{split}\\ ] ] it should be noted that the velocity field represented by equation  ( [ eq : cplxvelocity_af0 ] ) is singular on the vortex sheets , where the jump of the tangential - component velocity is equal to the strength of the vortex sheet @xcite .",
    "more details regarding the evaluation of the vortex sheets will be discussed in sections  [ sec:3 ] and  [ sec:4 ] . at this point ,",
    "the calculation of the entire flow field are reduced to determining the strength and distribution of only a few finite - length vortex sheets .    following previous studies @xcite ,",
    "the aerodynamic force applied on the airfoil can be estimated based on the rate of change of the total impulse in the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the position vector of a vortex - sheet element , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the unit vector normal to the 2d plane .",
    "@xmath20 is the density . @xmath21",
    "represents the entire vortex - sheet system , and @xmath22 in the current model .",
    "similarly , the total torque exerted by the fluid on the airfoil can be obtained from @xmath23 the main advantage of equations  ( [ eq : af_force ] ) and  ( [ eq : af_torque ] ) is that the calculations of force and torque are completely transformed into the dynamics of the bound and wake vorticies , which can be explicitly obtained from this aerodynamic model .",
    "the instantaneous velocity field around an airfoil can now be decided if the two free vortex sheets and one bound vortex sheet are given .",
    "this requires knowing the strengths and positions of the vortex sheets ( @xmath24 ) . considering the case where the flow initially remains",
    "fully attached , this indicates no flow separation or free vortex sheet existed at @xmath25 . under this assumption , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 for later times",
    "might be found through solving the formation and evolution of the free vortex sheets .",
    "so we assume that @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are known in order to solve the bound vortex sheet at any given time .",
    "furthermore , the position of the bound vortex sheet , @xmath30 , is also known as it coincides with the surface of the airfoil at any time . as a result ,",
    "the main task here is to solve for the vortex sheet strength @xmath31 .",
    "we should note that a bound vortex sheet is treated differently from a free vortex sheet since @xmath30 is prescribed .",
    "actually , the free vortex sheet is applied to represent the physical free shear layer , while the bound vortex sheet is introduced to ` mimic ' the effect of solid boundary .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the primary role of the bound vortex sheet is to satisfy the non - penetration boundary condition , which can be expressed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the flow velocity at the surface of the airfoil , @xmath30 , and @xmath34 is the unit normal vector of the surface .",
    "note that the definitions for @xmath35 and @xmath36 only applies to sections  [ sec:3 ] and  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "also , time @xmath37 is dropped here and in following derivations for simplicity although they should be satisfied instantaneously .",
    "@xmath38 is the velocity associated with the surface element of the airfoil so it generally describes the deformation of an airfoil .",
    "however , @xmath38 can be also applied to account for the translational motion in the complex - conjugate form , @xmath39 , and the rotational motion in the complex - conjugate form , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath35 .",
    "since the bound vortex sheet is placed at the surface of the airfoil , it creates a velocity jump across @xmath30 .",
    "based on equation  ( [ eq : cplxvelocity_af0 ] ) and the definition of a vortex sheet @xcite , the two limiting values for @xmath42 can be derived as @xmath43 \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma_{b}(s')\\frac{\\mathrm{d } \\bar{z}'}{|\\mathrm{d } z'| } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 denotes the cauchy principal value which excludes the vorticity at @xmath35 from the integral .",
    "@xmath45 is the complex form of the unit tangential vector , @xmath46 , at the surface of the airfoil . with @xmath46 pointing in the counter - clockwise direction of the airfoil body",
    ", @xmath47 becomes the velocity limit when the bound vortex sheet is approached from the outside of the airfoil , whereas @xmath48 is the velocity limit when the vortex sheet is approached from the inside .",
    "since @xmath49 is the flow velocity outside the surface of the airfoil , it should take the value @xmath47 . with",
    "@xmath34 written as @xmath50 , equation  ( [ eq : bc_af ] ) has the complex form @xmath51 \\frac{-i \\mathrm{d } z'}{|\\mathrm{d } z'| } \\right\\ } = 0.\\ ] ] ideally , equation  ( [ eq : bc_af1 ] ) would give the strength of the bound vortex sheet , @xmath31 , if @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are given . however , a general analytical solution to equation  ( [ eq : bc_af1 ] ) does not exist for an arbitrarily - shaped airfoil .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to solve this problem numerically by discretizing the bound vortex sheet into piecewise linear vortex panels .",
    "it should be noted that the strength of the bound vortex sheet @xmath31 can be expressed as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 represents the potential flow velocity at the fluid - solid boundary . with no - slip",
    "boundary condition , @xmath31 can be divided into two terms , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , according to @xcite .",
    "@xmath54 is purely associated with the body - surface motion relative to the reference frame , and it can be estimated from @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath55 is the physical vortex sheet corresponding to the viscous shear layer , which is given by @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , @xmath55 is invariant regardless of the reference frame being global or body - fixed , while both @xmath54 and @xmath31 could change as the reference frame changes . to avoid ambiguity",
    ", @xmath31 in this study only represents the bound vortex sheet in the global reference frame .",
    "now , with the velocity field and the bound vortex sheet determined from equations  ( [ eq : cplxvelocity_af0 ] ) and  ( [ eq : bc_af1 ] ) , respectively , we are faced with the task of determining the intensities and locations of the two free vortex sheets since @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the prerequisites for both equations .",
    "note again that the flow is assumed to be fully attached at @xmath58 , which means there is no free vortex sheet initially .",
    "therefore , determining the vortex sheets in the wake at @xmath59 requires understanding of the formation and evolution of the free vortex sheets that are detached from the airfoil .",
    "the evolution of a free vortex sheet should follow helmholtz laws of vortex motion @xcite for barotropic fluid with conservative body force . according to the third helmholtz law ,",
    "the circulation of a vortex sheet element can be treated as time invariant once it is detached from the airfoil .",
    "furthermore , the second helmholtz law dictates that a vortex element and its overlapping fluid particle should move together in the flow . in accordance with these principles , the velocity describing the motion of an element on a free vortex sheet can be derived using the birkhoff - rott equation @xcite . as a result ,",
    "this velocity formulation is similar to equation  ( [ eq : cplxvelocity_af0 ] ) , with @xmath60 replaced by @xmath61 for an element on the leading - edge vortex sheet or @xmath62 replaced by @xmath63 for an elment on the trailing - edge vortex sheet .",
    "again , @xmath44 denotes the cauchy principle integral , which removes the singularity induced by a vortex element itself .",
    "now , with the instantaneous distributions of vorticity obtained from the vortex - sheet evolution , we are left with the question of how vorticity is generated and shed from the root of a free vortex sheet .",
    "we first consider a simple case , where the vortex sheet is formed at the edge of a flat plate or a cusped trailing edge of an airfoil . without considering the viscous effect , a typical way of deciding the vortex - sheet formation at the trailing edge is the classical steady kutta condition .",
    "this condition requires the flow velocity at the trailing edge to be finite or the loading at the trailing edge to be zero , based on the physical sense that flow can not turn around a sharp edge .",
    "the application of this condition for a flat plate or a joukowski airfoil ( with cusped trailing edge ) has already been demonstrated in several previous works @xcite among others .",
    "basically , this condition is equivalent to enforcing a stagnation point at the trailing edge in the transformed circle plane .",
    "however , @xcite recently pointed out that a stagnation point generally does not exist at the trailing edge for the case of body rotation . as a result",
    ", they proposed to implement the unsteady kutta condition by relaxing the trailing edge point of the circle plane from totally stagnant to only stagnant in the tangential direction of the surface , which still conforms to the requirement of the classical kutta condition in the sense of preventing flow around the sharp edge .",
    "again , it is emphasized here that these steady and unsteady kutta conditions should be implemented in the transformed circle plane , which means they only apply to an airfoil that can be mathematically mapped to a circle .",
    "alternatively , @xcite modeled the flow around a flat plate using a bound vortex sheet coincident with the plate and two free vortex sheets that are emanating from the plate s two sharp edges , which is similar to the flow model presented here for an airfoil . by removing the singularities of the flow velocity at the trailing edge , which complies with the classical kutta condition that flow velocity",
    "should be finite at a sharp edge , jones managed to derive an analytical formulation for the unsteady kutta condition as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total circulation of the forming vortex sheet , so @xmath66 is the rate at which circulation is generated at the sharp edge to form the free vortex sheet .",
    "@xmath67 represents the average tangential slip between the plate and the bound vortex sheet at the sharp edge , and @xmath68 is the strength of the bound vortex sheet at the edge .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath67 and @xmath68 are properties associated with the bound vortex sheet . for an unsteady flow , according to the study of @xcite ( eq .",
    "4.134 ) , the free vortex sheet formed at the sharp edge satisfies @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the tangential velocity component and the strength of the forming vortex sheet , respectively .",
    "a comparison between this equation and equation  ( [ eq : fp_kc ] ) suggests that the strength of the forming vortex sheet is equal to the strength of its adjacent bound vortex sheet , while the tangential velocity of the forming vortex sheet relative to the flat plate equals the average tangential slip velocity between the bound vortex sheet and the sharp edge .",
    "furthermore , jones derivation also suggests that the tangential directions of the forming vortex sheet and the bound vortex sheet should match at the flow separation edge in order to completely remove the velocity singularities .",
    "therefore , jones unsteady kutta condition allows the analytical calculation of the direction , velocity , and strength of the forming vortex sheet for the trailing edge of a flat plate or a cusped airfoil , without any arbitrary implementation in the shedding procedure .",
    "since the current work is concerned with a general - shaped airfoil , the trailing edge of which could be different from a flat plate or a cusped edge like the joukowski airfoil , jones unsteady kutta condition might not be suitable . specifically ,",
    "if the upper and lower surfaces of the trailing edge have different tangential directions as shown in figure  [ fig : te - schm ] , the vortex - sheet configuration would be fundamentally different from that of jones work . to generalize this problem , we consider a sharp trailing edge where there is a finite angle , @xmath72 , between the upper and lower surfaces .",
    "a relevant question here is how to decide the direction of the forming free vortex sheet , given that the direction of the bound vortex sheet is ambiguous at the trailing edge .    before further discussions",
    ", here we emphasize that the second helmholtz law of vortex motion @xcite dictates that a free vortex sheet moves with its background flow as a material sheet . from a kinematic perspective",
    ", this means that a forming vortex sheet could be viewed as a streakline released from the vortex shedding edge in the body - fixed reference frame .",
    "furthermore , at the releasing location of a streakline , the directions of the streakline and the streamline are identical to each other .",
    "this further indicates that the direction of the forming vortex sheet coincides with the direction of the stagnation streamline at the trailing edge in the body - fixed reference frame .",
    "therefore , the ambiguity of the vortex - sheet direction is also reflected by the ambiguity of the streamline direction , which has been investigated by many previous studies .",
    "actually , for steady trailing - edge flow where the shedding of vorticity vanishes ( @xmath73 ) , @xcite pointed out that the steady kutta condition requires the stagnation streamline to bisect the wedge angle of a finite - angle trailing edge .",
    "otherwise , an unbalance between the upper and lower shear layers near the trailing edge would cause a non - zero vorticity generation which would violate the steady flow condition . according to this argument",
    ", an unsteady trailing - edge flow naturally generates vorticity and causes the stagnation streamline to divert from the wedge bisector line , which has been confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "a prominent theory for the unsteady situation has been proposed by @xcite and @xcite that the stagnation streamline is an extension of one of the two tangents at the trailing edge .",
    "although @xcite has provided extensive discussion supporting the giesing - maskell model , a notable drawback of this model is that it does not reduce to the steady - state solution in the limit of @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite reported that the giesing - maskell model only approximately holds for large @xmath75 , while they observed a smooth change of the stagnation - streamline direction for small @xmath75 .    in this study",
    ", we believe that the generation of the free vortex sheet at the trailing edge not only satisfies the physical kinematic condition , i.e. the kutta condition , but also complies with the conservation laws of circulation , mass , and momentum associated with the shear layers and their surrounding flow . figure  [ fig : te - schm ] shows the merging process of the upper and lower bound vortex sheets , which result in the formation of a free vortex sheet at the trailing edge . to formulate the problem ,",
    "we define a 2d material volume @xmath76 in the body - fixed reference frame with its boundary @xmath77 . @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the unit tangential and normal vectors of @xmath80 , respectively . and we recall that @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the unit tangential and normal vectors of a vortex sheet . @xmath83 and @xmath84 represent the velocity and the vorticity , respectively .",
    "a few physical assumptions and boundary conditions are listed below to simplify this problem . +",
    "( a ) the merging zone @xmath76 in reality should be a finite volume ( area ) with a length scale of @xmath85 .",
    "so @xmath86 have the dimension of @xmath87 .",
    "the merging process does not happen until the upper and lower streams meet exactly at the trailing edge , and any lead area of @xmath76 before the trailing edge should be much smaller than @xmath76 itself . to this point ,",
    "the length scale of @xmath88 and @xmath89 are assumed to be @xmath90 .",
    "for approximated solution , the length scale @xmath85 will be assumed to approach zero in the final derivations of this study .",
    "+ ( b ) @xmath91 and @xmath92 coincide with streamlines , so there is no mass flux across the surfaces and @xmath93 .",
    "+ ( c ) assuming the flow field changes smoothly , so @xmath94 of any quantity is finite . in the following",
    "we first take steps to derive the kutta condition and conservation of circulation for the above described problem .",
    "the conservations of mass and momentum will be discussed in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "we start with the analytical implementation of the physical kinematic relation , the unsteady kutta condition . according to our previous study of an unsteady flat plate @xcite , the rate of circulation generation @xmath66 at the trailing edge",
    "can be calculated by satisfying the condition @xmath95 which enforces the streamline in the tangential direction of the forming vortex sheet . for a flat plate or a cusped airfoil",
    ", this condition basically requires the vortex sheet to be tangential to the trailing - edge surface , which is consistent with the classical kutta condition that flow can not turn around a sharp edge . as discussed in section",
    "[ sec:4 - 1 ] , the rationale for equation  ( [ eq : unsteady_kutta ] ) is that the vortex sheet can be viewed as a streakline in the body - fixed reference frame , which coincides with the streamline at the trailing edge . here ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : unsteady_kutta ] ) will extended to the situation of a finite - angle trailing edge , with the direction of the forming vortex sheet assumed to be known for the time being .    to implement equation  ( [ eq : unsteady_kutta ] )",
    ", one needs first to calculate @xmath96 , the flow velocity at the trailing edge .",
    "figure  [ fig : te - vs - schm ] illustrates the vortex - sheet structures near the trailing edge , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the bound vortex strengths and @xmath99 is the strength of the forming vortex sheet as they approaches the trailing edge .",
    "we start by noting that the vortex - sheet strength is not well defined at the trailing - edge point , where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 are discontinuous with each other .",
    "so the trailing - edge point is actually a singularity point in the vortex - sheet system .",
    "fortunately , according to the birkhoff - rott equation @xcite , @xmath96 is estimated based on the de - singularized flow field without considering the vortex at the trailing edge point . based on the vortex - sheet configuration of figure  [ fig :",

    "considering the actual viscous shear layers near a separation point as shown in figure  [ fig : le - schm ] , the downstream - side shear layer consists of a reverse - flow layer and a separated - flow layer . in the vortex - sheet limit , the reverse - flow layer becomes the bound vortex sheet while the separated - flow layer becomes the separated vortex sheet .",
    "apparently , the velocities at both sides of the reverse - flow layer are zero ( @xmath287 ) , meaning the corresponding bound vortex - sheet strength is zero ( @xmath288 ) near the separation point .",
    "based on the above discussions , we can attribute the formation of the separated vortex sheet to the scenario of the giesing - maskell model . because @xmath289 for a smooth surface , we immediately obtain @xmath279 and @xmath290 , which means that the forming vortex sheet from a separation point of a smooth surface should be tangential to the surface .",
    "finally , applying equations  ( [ eq : vorticity_merge8 ] ) and  ( [ eq : vs_gamma_te ] ) gives the strength and velocity of the forming vortex sheet , which are actually equal to the values of its upstream bound vortex sheet ( @xmath291 and @xmath292 ) .    at this point",

    "although the background flow can be treated as a steady flow for @xmath298 , the problem itself is naturally unsteady because of the formation of a starting trailing - edge vortex ( tev ) .",

    "furthermore , it is important to note here that @xmath310 at @xmath312 does not start from zero although the bound circulation increases from zero . following recent studies @xcite that attributed major lift generation to the effect of vortex motion , this initial lift should be caused by a strong redistribution effect of the vorticity inside the bound vortex sheet .",

    "we again observe a generally good agreement between experiment and simulation , verifying the performance of the proposed flow model .",
    "especially , the results of @xmath343 have promising accuracy for all three different cases .",
    "since @xmath343 physically represents the lift coefficient , this indicates a prospective application of the current model for lift estimation without modeling the leading - edge separation .",
    "however , the void of flow separation in the current simulation seems to have a notable impact on @xmath342 , which corresponds to the thrust coefficient .",
    "this is reflected by the over - prediction of @xmath342 in some cases displayed in figures  [ fig : af_comp3](a ) and  [ fig : af_comp4](a ) .",
    "other than the flow separation , the viscous effect at the solid - fluid interface could also affect the accuracy of predicting thrust or drag using an inviscid flow model .    to explain the effect of the additional in - line motion on force generation of the airfoil , the variations of the airfoil velocity @xmath319 and the angle of attack @xmath297 are plotted in figures  [ fig : af_comp3](b ) ,  [ fig : af_comp4](b ) , and  [ fig : af_comp5](b ) .",
    "we can observe that the variations of @xmath297 in figures  [ fig : af_comp4 ] and  [ fig : af_comp5 ] are identical , and @xmath297 only changes in the first half cycle while it remains zero in the second half cycle .",
    "since the shedding of strong vorticity mainly occurs at non - zero angles of attack , the force generation associated with vortex shedding should mostly happen during the first half cycle . in this sense ,",
    "the first half cycle is the actual ` stroke ' while the second half can be considered as the ` recovery ' .",
    "however , the different in - line motions during the first half cycle causes @xmath319 to increase significantly for the bird - like downstroke in figure  [ fig : af_comp4 ] and decrease significantly for the turtle - like downstroke in figure  [ fig : af_comp5 ] .",
    "this creates stronger and faster trailing - edge vortices of the bird - like downstroke compared to the turtle - like downstroke . as a result ,",
    "the bird - like downstroke provides much higher lift than the turtle - like downstroke . finally , we note that the angle of the trailing - edge vortex sheet , @xmath137 , varies smoothly within the limits of the two tangential directions of the trailing edge , @xmath295 and @xmath296 .",
    "this also implies the correct implementation of the proposed models , and is in accordance with the experimental observation of @xcite that the direction of the trailing - edge streamline changes smoothly .",
    "an unsteady aerodynamic model for an airfoil was derived based on the dynamics of the bound vortex sheet and the wake vortices .",
    "the vorticity generation mechanism at the trailing edge was studied since it is essential to predict the vortex shedding and evolution processes in the wake . for a flat plate or a cusped trailing edge ,",
    "this can be solved by applying an unsteady kutta condition , based on the physical sense that flow can not turn around a sharp edge . however , this condition for an airfoil with finite - angle trailing edge is not straightforward to implement .",
    "specifically , the vortex sheet formed at the trailing - edge of a flat plate is known to the tangential to the flat plate , whereas the angle of the forming vortex sheet for an airfoil could vary between the two tangential directions of the trailing edge . realizing that any arbitrary choice for the vortex - sheet angle would be ad - hoc , this study proposed to calculate this angle based on the basic conservation laws of mass and momentum , together with the condition derived from the kelvin s circulation theorem .",
    "this resulted in the analytical expression of the angle , strength , and velocity of a free vortex sheet formed at a finite - angle trailing edge , establishing a general unsteady kutta condition for relevant problems .",
    "the significance of this work is that the vortex - sheet formation condition allows the angle of the forming vortex sheet to continuously change between the two tangents of the trailing edge .",
    "this resolves the paradox of the giesing - maskell model that it does not converge to the steady - state kutta condition .",
    "airfoils in various steady and unsteady flows were simulated and the resulting flow field and force calculations were compared with experimental data .",

    "<S> , the classical kutta condition can be extended to unsteady situations by realizing that a flow can not turn abruptly around a sharp edge . </S>",
    "<S> this condition can be readily applied to a flat plate or an airfoil with cusped trailing edge since the direction of the forming vortex sheet is known to be tangential to the trailing edge . however , for a finite - angle trailing edge , or in the case of flow separation away from a sharp corner , the direction of the forming vortex sheet is ambiguous . to remove any ad - hoc implementation , the unsteady kutta condition , the conservation of circulation , as well as </S>",
    "<S> the conservation laws of mass and momentum are coupled to analytically solve for the angle , strength , and relative velocity of the trailing - edge vortex sheet . </S>",
