    "a crucial ingredient in the continuum hydrodynamics is the boundary condition of fluid flow past a solid surface .",
    "the no - slip boundary condition , i.e. , zero relative velocity between the fluid and solid at the interface , is a core concept in fluid mechanics @xcite . in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , however , a small amount of relative slip between the fluid and the solid surface is generally detected @xcite .",
    "such slip can be accounted for by the navier boundary condition ( nbc ) , whereby the slip velocity is proportional to the tangential viscous stress and the degree of slip is measured by a slip length @xcite .",
    "as the relative slip is extremely small in macroscopic flows , the nbc is practically indistinguishable from the no - slip boundary condition in most situations .",
    "when applied to the immiscible two - phase flow of moving contact line , where a fluid - fluid interface intersects the solid wall , the no - slip boundary condition would cause non - integrable diverging stress and unphysical infinite dissipation , which directly imply the breakdown of the no - slip boundary condition @xcite . in the past two decades , md simulations have shown fluid slip in the molecular - scale vicinity of the moving contact line @xcite .",
    "recent evidences have shown the slip velocity profile obtained from md simulations to be accountable by the generalized navier boundary condition @xcite , in which the slip velocity is proportional to the total tangential stress  the sum of the viscous stress and the uncompensated young stress ; the latter arises from the deviation of the fluid - fluid interface from its static configuration .",
    "the no - slip boundary condition also runs into trouble when applied to the driven cavity flow , where a rigid plane slides steadily over another , with a constant inclination angle @xcite .",
    "this geometry readily shows that the no - slip boundary condition would cause the same non - integrable diverging stress as in the problem of moving contact line . near the corner where fixed and moving solid surfaces intersect , the velocity variation becomes very fast because two different velocities are assumed at the two solid surfaces .",
    "moreover , a velocity discontinuity occurs at the corner if the no - slip boundary condition is everywhere applied .",
    "this is the origin of the non - integrable @xmath0 stress at @xmath2 .",
    "a slip boundary condition is therefore imperative .",
    "koplik and banavar first used md simulations to explore the small - scale structure of the driven cavity flow @xcite .",
    "their results indicate that slip occurs in the corner region . to uncover the slip mechanism",
    ", they measured the microscopic tangential stress at the fluid - solid interface .",
    "this stress measurement led to the conclusions that local non - newtonian region exists in a low - shear and otherwise newtonian flow ( at low reynolds number ) and that the nbc is not valid .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to uncover the slip boundary condition and formulate a continuum hydrodynamic model for the driven cavity flow , from which we will answer the intriguing question : in a mesoscopic or macroscopic system , what is the slip profile which consistently interpolates between the inevitable slippage in the immediate vicinity of the corner and the no - slip boundary condition that must hold at mesoscopic / macroscopic regions far away ?",
    "success would lead to new understanding to slip and dissipation in restricted geometries @xcite .",
    "the continuum hydrodynamic modeling requires a slip boundary condition and a momentum transport equation .",
    "we have carried out md simulations similar to those performed for the moving contact line problem @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the conclusions in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nbc is found to be governing the slip of fluid relative to the solid .",
    "the shear stress is verified to be newtonian in the vicinity of the corner where velocity and stress variations are extremely large .",
    "technically , we denote a molecular boundary layer of fluid at the fluid - solid interface .",
    "we then perform stress measurement using a method that is reliable near the interface @xcite .",
    "velocity and stress data collected at the boundary layer provide molecular evidence for the validity of the nbc .",
    "we emphasize that unlike the couette flow simulated in ref .",
    "@xcite , here the driven cavity flow requires a local verification of the nbc , because the slip velocity varies along the solid surface and this variation becomes very fast in the corner region . as for the newtonian behavior , local velocity and shear stress",
    "are measured everywhere in the fluid , showing that the shear stress is proportional to the local shear rate .",
    "based upon the conclusions drawn directly from the simulated cavity flow , a continuum hydrodynamic model has been formulated , comprising the navier - stokes equation and the nbc . with all the material parameters directly determined from md simulations ,",
    "our model has _ no _ adjustable parameter .",
    "numerical calculations have been carried out to produce continuum results for comparison with md results .",
    "it is shown that in a wide range of reynolds number , md and continuum flow fields agree well , from the molecular - scale corner region ( with large slip ) to the large - scale outer region ( with vanishing slip in a large system ) .",
    "the largest reynolds number ever reached is @xmath3 , at which deviation from the stokes flow is clearly noted ( see sec .",

    "we consider a single fluid confined in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) cavity formed by two horizontal walls in the @xmath4 plane and two vertical walls in the @xmath5 plane ( see fig .",

    "each of the four walls is constructed by two to four [ 001 ] planes of an fcc lattice , with each wall molecule attached to the lattice site by a harmonic spring .",

    "the wall - fluid interaction is modeled by a modified lj potential @xmath16,\\ ] ] with energy and range parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and a @xmath19 for tuning the wetting property of the fluid .",
    "both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are truncated at @xmath22 . in our simulations ,",
    "the density of fluid @xmath23 equals to @xmath24 , the density of wall @xmath25 equals to @xmath26 ( which determines the wall lattice constant ) , the mass of wall molecule @xmath27 equals to the mass of fluid molecule @xmath28 , the parameters in @xmath21 are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , and the temperature @xmath32 is fixed at @xmath33 .",
    "the values of @xmath11 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 are varied as external conditions in different simulations .",
    "the steady - state flow fields are obtained from time averages over @xmath34 to @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the atomic time scale @xmath37 .",
    "we have also performed similar simulations for other temperatures ranging from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "the md velocity profiles can always be reproduced by our continuum model , with material parameters directly determined from md simulations .",
    "this is due to the fact that the fluid remains to be newtonian and the slip length is a constant at a given temperature .",
    "details will be presented in sec .",
    "[ temperature - effect ] .",
    "we denote the region within @xmath40 of the fluid surface the boundary layer ( bl )",
    ". it must be thin enough to ensure sufficient precision for measuring the slip velocity at the solid surface , but also thick enough to fully account for the tangential wall - fluid interaction force .",
    "the wall force can be singled out by separating the force on each fluid molecule into wall - fluid and fluid - fluid components .",
    "the fluid molecules in the bl , being close to the solid wall , can detect the discrete structure of the wall ( the ` roughness ' of the wall potential @xcite ) . when coupled with kinetic collisions with the wall molecules",
    ", there arises a nonzero tangential wall force density @xmath41 that is sharply peaked at @xmath42 and vanishes beyond @xmath43 . here",
    "the subscript @xmath7 in @xmath41 and the @xmath9 coordinates are for the bl at the lower fluid - solid interface ( same below ) , with the understanding that the same physics holds at the other three fluid - solid interfaces . from the force density @xmath41",
    ", we define the tangential wall force per unit area as @xmath44 , which is the total tangential wall force accumulated across the bl",
    ".    spatial resolution along the @xmath7 and @xmath9 directions is achieved by evenly dividing the sampling region into bins , each @xmath45 by @xmath46 in size .",
    "the slip velocity @xmath47 in the lower / upper bl is obtained as the time average of fluid molecules velocities in each bl bin , measured with respect to the moving wall ( @xmath48 in the lower bl , or @xmath49 in the upper bl ) ; the tangential wall force @xmath50 in the lower / upper bl is obtained from the time average of the total tangential wall force experienced by the fluid molecules in each bl bin , divided by the bin area in the @xmath4 plane ; the fluid stress component @xmath51 is obtained from the time averages of the kinetic momentum transfer plus the fluid - fluid interaction forces across the constant-@xmath52 bin surfaces , and the fluid velocity component @xmath53 is measured as the time - average of that component within each bin .",
    "in particular , we have directly measured the fluid - fluid interaction forces across bin surfaces to obtain the contribution of intermolecular forces to the fluid stress , because the validity of the irving - kirkwood stress expression was noted to be not justified at a fluid - fluid or fluid - solid interface @xcite .",
    "the technical details for the stress measurement near a fluid - fluid or fluid - solid interface may be found in appendix b of ref .",
    "figure [ fig - slip ] shows the md evidence for the existence of slip .",
    "it is seen that the slippage along @xmath7 becomes quite large near the corner , as already observed in ref .",
    "in particular , the fluid undergoes near - complete slip in approaching the corner , regardless of the system size .",
    "( by near - complete , we mean @xmath54 approaches @xmath11 . )",
    "far away from the corner ( for fluid that extends long enough along @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath55 ) , the flow is not perturbed by the vertical walls due to viscous damping , i.e. , the uniform shear flow prevails and a small constant slip is detected .",
    "the nbc is the simplest alternative of the no - slip boundary condition .",
    "it states that the amount of slip is proportional to the tangential fluid stress at the solid surface . for a newtonian fluid ,",
    "the tangential viscous stress is proportional to the shear rate .",
    "consequently , the nbc becomes that the amount of slip is proportional to the shear rate @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 , where the proportionality constant @xmath58 is the slip length @xcite .",
    "physically , a nonzero slip length arises from the unequal wall and fluid densities , the weak wall - fluid interaction , and the high temperature .",
    "together , they prevent the epitaxial locking of fluid layer(s ) to the solid wall , and thus allow slip to occur .",
    "a recent study shows that fluid flow in carbon nanopores is characterized by a large slip length @xcite .",
    "the verification of the nbc in the driven cavity flow , where slip velocity varies along the solid wall , consists of three stages .",
    "( i ) we show that @xmath47 is proportional to @xmath50 , the local tangential wall force per unit area .",
    "( ii ) we show that @xmath50 is balanced by the tangential fluid force @xmath59 .",
    "this force balance is necessary because inertial effects are negligible in the bl of molecular thickness .",
    "accordingly , @xmath47 is also proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "here we emphasize that our stress measurement scheme has been designed to obtain the tangential fluid force correctly .",
    "( iii ) we show that the shear stress is newtonian . from ( ii ) and ( iii )",
    "the slip length @xmath58 can be defined and measured .",
    "as shown in fig . [ fig - wall ] , the tangential wall force per unit area @xmath50 is proportional to the local slip velocity @xmath47 : @xmath60 where the proportionality constant @xmath61 is the slip coefficient . to see",
    "if nonlinearity would arise for large @xmath11 , md simulations have been performed at @xmath62 .",
    "figure [ fig - wall ] shows that for the wall - fluid interaction used here , nonlinearity in the slip boundary condition is accessible when @xmath63 .",
    "according to the nonlinear effect discovered by thompson and troian @xcite , the slip length @xmath64 increases with the increasing slip velocity when the latter is sufficiently large .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - wall ] where @xmath61 decreases with the increasing @xmath54 .",
    "the bl is thin enough to make the inertial term negligible in momentum equation ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "it follows that the tangential wall force @xmath50 is balanced by the tangential fluid force per unit wall area , @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath66 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - balance ] .",

    "( more strictly , @xmath70 because there is no fluid below @xmath71 , hence no momentum transport across @xmath71 . )",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ gwslip ] ) and the tangential force balance that @xmath72    it is worth emphasizing that the normal stress @xmath73 in the bl exhibits extremely large variation in the partial - slip region close to the corner , where @xmath47 varies quickly along @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , the normal stress variation is so large that a small fluid density difference is even noted between the low- and high - pressure regions .",
    "quantitatively , the bl - integrated normal stress @xmath74 is essential to reaching eq .",
    "( [ gfslip ] ) , because close to the corner , the contribution of @xmath75 to @xmath59 is of the same order as that of @xmath76 .",
    "( in the region of uniform shear flow far away from the corner , @xmath77 . )    to summarize , in obtaining the navier slip condition eq .",
    "( [ gfslip ] ) , we first identify the bl and measure the tangential wall force therein to obtain eq .",
    "( [ gwslip ] ) .",
    "we then measure the normal and tangential stresses @xmath73 and @xmath78 according to the original definition of stress ( because the irving - kirkwood expression is not reliable near the fluid - solid interface ) .",
    "we finally calculate the tangential fluid force according to eq .",
    "( [ gf - expression ] ) to verify the equation of bl force balance .    equation ( [ gf - expression ] ) is due to the finite thickness of the bl , in which a tangential wall force is sharply distributed along the solid surface normal .",
    "nevertheless , it is a reasonable expectation that the fluid would experience almost the identical physical effect(s ) from a wall force density @xmath79 , concentrated strictly at @xmath71 with the same total wall force per unit area . replacing a diffuse bl by a sharp bl",
    "can considerably simplify the form of the boundary condition , because local force balance along @xmath7 then requires @xmath80 away from @xmath71 .",
    "integration of this relation from @xmath81 to @xmath82 yields @xmath83 a comparison with eq .",
    "( [ gf - expression ] ) then relates @xmath59 to @xmath78 at surface : @xmath84 .",

    "the bl is from @xmath87 to @xmath81 , instead of from @xmath88 to @xmath82 as in the diffuse case .",
    "correspondingly , the nbc becomes @xmath89 in the sharp boundary limit .",
    "it remains to be seen if the fluid is newtonian , that is , if the viscous stress tensor is proportional to the rate of strain tensor .",
    "in particular , we need to find out if the tangential stress @xmath78 is still proportional to the local shear rate @xmath56 as the fluid - solid interface is approached .",
    "we have measured both @xmath78 and @xmath56 at @xmath90 ( @xmath91 is the top surface of the lower bl ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - newton ] , the ratio of @xmath78 to @xmath56 is indeed a constant at each @xmath9 level , but this constant varies a little along @xmath9 near the wall , due to the short - range density modulation induced by the rigid wall @xcite .",
    "far away from the wall , the fluid density approaches a @xmath9-independent constant , and so does the ratio of @xmath78 to @xmath56 . to see if non - newtonian response would arise for large @xmath11 , md simulations have been performed at @xmath92 .",
    "figure [ fig - newton ] shows that the viscosity remains to be a constant for @xmath11 as large as @xmath93 .",
    "this is due to the fact that for @xmath92 and @xmath94 , the shear rate is @xmath95 or smaller , whereas non - newtonian response of bulk fluid is expected for @xmath96 .    from eq .",
    "( [ gfslip ] ) and the sharp boundary limit @xmath97 , we have eq . ( [ sharp - boundary - nbc ] ) .",
    "as the shear stress is verified to be newtonian , i.e. , @xmath98 , we obtain the commonly used hydrodynamic nbc @xmath99 with the slip length @xmath64 . according to the sharp boundary limit involved in obtaining eq .",
    "( [ nbc ] ) , we should compare the md tangential fluid force @xmath100 with the continuum tangential viscous stress @xmath101 at surface .",
    "practically , a comparison between the md and continuum profiles of @xmath47 would suffice because @xmath102 in the md and @xmath103 in the continuum hydrodynamics .",

    "taking @xmath8 as the length unit , @xmath11 as the velocity unit , and @xmath115 as the pressure / stress unit , we are left with three dimensionless controlling parameters : the aspect ratio @xmath116 , the dimensionless slip length @xmath117 , and the reynolds number @xmath118",
    ". in the regime of small reynolds number ( stokes flow ) the only controlling parameters are @xmath116 and @xmath119 .",
    "the finite - difference scheme used for solving the navier - stokes equation is a modified version of the pressure - poisson formulation given in ref .",

    "it is seen that the three md profiles approach the same limiting profile @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the reynolds number @xmath123 ranges from @xmath124 to @xmath125 in the three cases , thus justifies the stokes - flow limit . in fig .",

    "a small discrepancy is noticed for the bl tangential velocity ( or slip velocity ) in a small region close to the corner where the slip amount is relatively large and displays sharp decay .",

    "[ fig - stokes ] .",
    "again , this is caused by the short - range density modulation induced by the rigid wall @xcite , given the same short distance @xmath126 here .",

    "note this @xmath135 tends to vanish as @xmath8 is sufficiently large .",
    "now we turn to the variation of the slip velocity along the solid surface , still in the regime of small reynolds number ( the largest @xmath136 for the largest @xmath8 ) .",

    "the tangential slip velocity profiles at the fluid - solid interface , i.e. , the slip profiles , are shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig - power ] .",

    "according to the nbc , the power - law variation of slippage means the same variation of tangential stress .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic @xmath0 behavior of the stress variation @xcite has indeed been observed in md simulations . with @xmath8 being finite and @xmath6 being sufficiently large ( @xmath141 ) ,",
    "far from the corners there is always a region of uniform shear flow , where the slip amount is a constant , given by @xmath134 .",

    "we want to point out that when formulated correctly , continuum hydrodynamic approach may still be applicable to some of these problems , including the moving contact line @xcite and the driven cavity flow . for each problem ,",
    "the validity of its continuum model has been verified , first by a direct md measurement and then by a comparison with full md results .",

    "<S> the md results not only show the existence of fluid slip but also verify the validity of the navier slip boundary condition . to better understand the fluid slip in this problem , a continuum hydrodynamic model has been formulated based upon the md verification of the navier boundary condition and the newtonian stress . </S>",

    "<S> , the structure of this core region is nearly independent of the system size . on the other hand , for sufficiently large system , an additional partial - slip region appears where the slippage varies as @xmath0 with @xmath1 denoting the distance from the corner along the moving solid surface . </S>",
