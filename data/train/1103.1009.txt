    "the seminal work by watts and strogatz on small - world networks  @xcite , and that by barabsi and albert on scale - free networks ( i.e. , b - a networks )  @xcite , have pioneered a wave of research activities on the complex networks in last decade ( see , for instance , recent review articles  @xcite , books  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "research toward understanding the new critical phenomena in complex networks , e.g. , the structural phase transitions in networks , is also a rapidly developing area  @xcite .",
    "it is found that the condensation phase transitions occur in many complex network models  @xcite .",
    "particularly , in ref .",
    "@xcite , bianconi - barabsi ( b - b ) fitness model  @xcite was mapped into an equilibrium bose gas , a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) behavior was obtained , and the critical point for condensation was identified by mean - field arguments . there",
    "the well - known b - a networks  @xcite are generalized by introducing the _ fitness _ parameter , @xmath2 . at each time step , a new node with @xmath3 links is added to the nodes that already presented in the network .",
    "the fitness @xmath2 , accounting for the competition for links in the network , is chosen randomly from a distribution .",
    "the probability @xmath4 that a new node connects one of its @xmath3 links to a node @xmath5 depends on the number of links , @xmath6 , and on its fitness @xmath2 , is _",
    "[ pi ]    in order to map the fitness model into bose gases , one assigns an `` energy '' @xmath7 , introduced randomly from a distribution @xmath8 , for the @xmath5th node , and the fitness of the node , @xmath2 , is defined as _",
    "i = e^-_i , where the parameter @xmath9 , can be identified as inverse `` temperature '' @xmath10 .",
    "this growing network can be solved in a mean - field approximation and a `` chemical potential '' @xmath11 is determined by the self - consistent equation i ( , ) = d g ( ) n ( ) = 1 , [ selfc ] where the bose occupation number @xmath12 is the number of links attached by the preferential attachment mechanism to nodes with `` energy '' @xmath13 . a bec phase transition occurs in the networks if @xmath14 , i.e. , the self - consistent equation ( [ selfc ] ) has no solution ( in such case the self - consistent approach fails ) .",
    "a necessary condition for condensation is that the distribution @xmath15 for @xmath16 . for this type distributions",
    "there exists a critical temperature @xmath17 such that @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "however , it should be noted that be statistics appearing in b - b growing network is only formally equivalent to that in ideal bose gases .",
    "this is due to the fact that the evolution of b - b network is in essential irreversible and out - of - equilibrium , while the bec of ideal bose gases is a temperature - driven equilibrium process . on the other hand ,",
    "it was argued  @xcite a wide variety of complex networks have self - similar , fractal property . under such circumstances , a particularly useful and appropriate framework to describe",
    "the dynamical evolution of the network is so - called tsallis nonextensive statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "it is a certain generalization of the usual boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) formulation . for the applications of the formulation in many fields , including complex networks , one may see ,",
    "e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein . in present work ,",
    "we consider the possibility of embedding the b - b fitness model in the framework of tsallis formulation of the non - extensive statistical mechanics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we briefly review tsallis formulation of the nonextensive statistical mechanics , and introduce tsallis mapping in the b - b fitness model of the complex network . we show that the corresponding rate equation has a power - law solution under some approximation within the high temperature regime , in thermodynamic limit .",
    "for general situations without the thermodynamic limit , the numerical simulations are need .",
    "the main simulation results are shown and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . finally , we summarize and draw our conclusions .",
    "in tsallis formulation of non - extensive statistical mechanics , the central equation is so - called the nonextensive entropy , which is defined as    s_q = ( 1 - _ i p^q_i ) ,    where @xmath20 is the probabilities for the ensemble to be in the state @xmath5 .",
    "the non - extensive parameter @xmath0 describes the degree of deviations of a physical quantity from extensive and therefore may be regarded as a new phenomenological parameter of the model used , different values of @xmath21 quantifies the departure from the bg limit .",
    "the standard results of bg statistical mechanics are recovered in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "the application of the non - extensive statistical mechanics to boson gases predicts a @xmath0-deformed be statistics  @xcite : n_q ( ) = , [ qbe ] where @xmath23 is the occupation number of an energy level @xmath13 and @xmath11 the chemical potential .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is the inverse temperature .",
    "a @xmath0-exponential function is introduced in eqn .",
    "( [ qbe ] ) as follows  @xcite : e^z_q ^1/(1-q ) , if the argument @xmath24 is positive , @xmath25 equals to zero otherwise .",
    "its inverse function , the @xmath0-logarithm , for any positive real number @xmath26 , is _ q z .",
    "[ qlog ] both @xmath0-logarithm and @xmath0-exponential functions go back to the usual logarithm and exponential functions , respectively , when one takes @xmath22 limit .    in order to map b - b fitness model to a boson gas with tsallis statistics , under the self - consistency condition",
    ", we assign the @xmath5th node with a fitness , @xmath2 , by _",
    "i = e^-_i_q = ( 1 + ( 1 - q)(-_i))^1/(1 - q ) , and its inverse is _",
    "i = - _ q_i = - , where @xmath7 follows the energy level distribution @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a normalization factor .",
    "a necessary condition for condensation is that when @xmath16 , @xmath15 consistently .",
    "the resulting rate equation which describes the degree of connectivity at time @xmath29 of the @xmath5th node ( energy level ) , @xmath30 , is then : [ rate ] = , where [ zq ] z^q_t = ^t_j = 1 e^-_j_q k_j ( _ j , t , t_j ) , is the @xmath0-deformed partition function . following the standard statistical mechanics  @xcite , the definition of fugacity @xmath31",
    "is given , in a consistent way , by @xmath0-deformed form , @xmath32 , in which @xmath11 is the chemical potential .    the phase structure of this b - b fitness model with tsallis mapping",
    "is now controlled by two parameters , i.e. , the inverse temperature @xmath9 and the nonextensive parameter @xmath0 , instead of ( only ) one parameter @xmath9 in the original b - b fitness model .",
    "these two parameters both affect the phase transition of the network .",
    "a few limiting situations are worthy of being discussed before further detailed numerical simulations .",
    "first , in @xmath22 limit , the b - b model with tsallis mapping goes back to the original one with bose gas mapping , due to the fact that tsallis @xmath0-deformed expressions approach to the usual ones , and all the known results of the b - b model are recovered as they should .",
    "henceforth , the scale - free phase in original b - b fitness model is trivially recovered when all nodes have the same fitness , i.e. , @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "second , with @xmath22 limit and the thermodynamic limit @xmath34 as well , we find that the rate equation ( [ rate ] ) has a power law solution under some appropriate approximation , within high temperature region , in which @xmath9 is a small quantity .",
    "this phase , as matter of fact , is similar to the fit - get - rich ( fgr ) phase in the original b - b fitness model  @xcite .    to see the latter , we assume that the solution takes the following form : [ powerlaw ] k_i(_i , t , t_i ) ~()^f_q(_i ) , where @xmath35 is some unknown power - law exponent and to be determined later . for simplicity we will write @xmath36 from now on . taking the energy distribution of the nodes @xmath8 into account ,",
    "the partition function becomes ~d g",
    "( ) ^t_1 e^-_q k_i ( , t , t_0 ) , here we use @xmath37 stand for the partition function averaging over @xmath8 . now inserting @xmath38 ( in eqn.([powerlaw ] ) ) into @xmath37 , one obtains & ~ & d g ( ) ^t_1 e^-_q ( ) ^f_q + & = & d g ( ) e^-_q t^f_q - 1 ( ) + & = & d g ( ) e^-_q t^f_q - 1 ( _ f_q t ) + & ~ & z^-1 ( 1 - t^-(1 - f_q ) ) , [ last ] [ zqt ] where @xmath39 is the @xmath40-logarithm as introduced in eqn .",
    "( [ qlog ] ) and the inverse fugacity @xmath41 is [ invfugacity ] z^-1 = d g ( ) . note that in eqn .",
    "( [ zqt ] ) , @xmath42 , such that in thermodynamic limit @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and hence @xmath45 in the corresponding limit .",
    "this makes one able to determine aforementioned power - law exponent @xmath40 .",
    "note that in high temperature region , @xmath9 is small , and that @xmath0 is very close to unity ( such that @xmath46 is small as well ) , so we can take the approximation @xmath47",
    "@xcite , as a result , the exponent @xmath40 of the power - law solution in eqn .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) is , [ fq ] f_q = e^-(- ) _ q , in @xmath22 limit , this exponent goes back to the one in the original b - b fitness model  @xcite .",
    "the fugacity becomes [ limit ] z^-1 = _ t = dg ( ) , and the chemical potential @xmath11 is the solution of the following equation , [ iq ] i_q ( , ) = d g ( ) = 1 , which indicates a mapping to bose gas with tsallis statistics , and the corresponding occupation number of a energy level @xmath13 is @xmath48 .",
    "this just follows tsallis statistics .    for general situations without taking into account above limits",
    ", one has to resort to numerical simulations for current model with tsallis mapping .",
    "in the original b - b fitness model , the signal of the condensation phase transition lies on the change of sign of the chemical potential @xmath11 , i.e. , when @xmath11 experiences a change from negative value to positive value within some regime , that change identifies the critical point of the corresponding phase transition .",
    "similarly , we use the same criterion for the phase transition in the b - b fitness network with tsallis mapping .",
    "this is done by numerically computation of the chemical potential @xmath11 , without the thermodynamic limit , according to the following way : = - _ q = - , [ mu_q ] where @xmath49 is the @xmath0-logarithm of @xmath37 which is defined in eqn .",
    "( [ zq ] ) .",
    "note that in above numerical simulations , the computation of @xmath11 strictly follows its definition and has no approximations in them .",
    "the  phase diagrams \" of the b - b fitness network with tsallis mapping are demonstrated by our numerical simulations and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]   [ fig3 ] . in both figures , the size of the evolving network , or the time steps , is taken to be @xmath50 and we fix @xmath51 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the absolute value of the chemical potential @xmath11 , which is defined in eqn .",
    "( [ mu_q ] ) , is numerically computed with an average over @xmath52 runs , using the energy level distribution @xmath53 for energies @xmath54 ( 0 , 1 ) , i.e. , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , respectively . as expected , for @xmath57 , the phases emerge in the system are coincident with those in the original b - b fitness model : the fgr phase and the bec phase ( the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , and the same transition temperature is located at @xmath61 ( the vertical dash - line on the right ) .",
    "however , when the value of parameter @xmath0 deviates from @xmath62 , e.g. , for @xmath63 , @xmath59 , and/or @xmath60 , the phases correspondingly change depending on both the specific value of @xmath0 and the temperature they take ( see the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "also , it can be seen from the figure that the transition temperature @xmath64 decreases and @xmath65 ( the vertical dashed line on the left in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , in @xmath66 regime , the whole  tsallis condensate \" curve deviates from the bec curve . on the other hand ,",
    "it is no surprise that the effect of @xmath0 parameter disappears gradually in the high temperature limit . the effect of different energy level distribution is shown in fig .",

    "in conclusion , we consider bianconi - barabsi fitness model of growing networks in the framework of non - extensive statistical mechanics via tsallis mapping in the fitness parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the phenomenological nonextensive parameter @xmath0 plays an important role in the dynamical evolution of complex networks : the underlying evolving networks may undergo some fgr - like phase in high temperature region with a nonextensive parameter controlled power - law degree distribution and it goes back to the original fgr phase of b - b fitness model in @xmath22 limit ; on the other hand , in low temperature regime , particularly for @xmath92 ( where @xmath1 is the critical temperature ) , a condensate phase emerges . for this condensate phase ,",
