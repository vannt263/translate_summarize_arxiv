    "a fraction of the electron neutrinos produced by thermonuclear reactions in the core of the sun disappear during their travel to the earth .",
    "this deficit is the famous `` solar neutrino problem '' , discovered almost forty year ago .",
    "there have been many attempts to solve this puzzle during the years since its discovery .",
    "some of them were based on modifications of the solar model in order to have a lower neutrino production , although there was a conflict with the energy spectrum provided by the four first - generation experiments homestake @xcite , kamiokande @xcite , gallex / gno @xcite and sage @xcite .",
    "recent experiments ( super - kamiokande @xcite and sno @xcite ) have improved dramatically the precision of solar neutrino data .",
    "the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) experiment @xcite , in which the fluxes of solar @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 on the earth have been measured through charged - current ( cc ) , neutral - current ( nc ) and elastic scattering ( es ) interactions , has shown that the solar neutrino deficit is due to @xmath5 transitions .",
    "the fit of all solar neutrino data favor the so - called large mixing angle ( lma ) solution , in which the msw effect @xcite is operative inside the sun .",
    "the lma solution has been confirmed by the reactor experiment kamland @xcite , which observed @xmath6 oscillations of reactor antineutrinos .",
    "working in the framework of three - neutrino mixing with a small @xmath7 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we analyzed the solar neutrino data with the effective mixing @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mixing angle and @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the massive neutrinos with masses @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the flavor neutrino @xmath14 is a linear combination of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are indistinguishable in solar neutrino experiments and in the kamland experiment .",
    "in fact , it is easy to show that @xmath17 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , with @xmath18 from the super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino data @xcite .    in the framework of neutrino oscillations , a standard least - squares analysis method is usually adopted to analyze the data in the context of frequentist statistics @xcite .",
    "these analyses have shown that the solar neutrino problem is solved by the lma solution .",
    "however , there is a different statistical approach , the bayesian probability theory .",
    "the bayesian analysis of solar neutrino data has several advantages over a frequentist one ( see the discussions in refs .",
    "bayesian analyses of early solar neutrino data have been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the updated solar neutrino data and the last kamland data .",
    "the solar and kamland neutrino experiments are briefly described in section  [ sec : experiments ] . section  [ sec : numerical ] gives a short description of our implementation of the standard least - squares method . in section",
    "[ sec : bayesian ] we present our results for the bayesian allowed regions corresponding to a flat prior in the plane of the oscillation parameters @xmath0 and @xmath19 . in section  [ sec : work ]",
    "we investigate the stability of the bayesian allowed regions for other reasonable choices of the prior .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the first experiment to observe solar neutrinos , was designed and started by r. davis and his collaborators in the late 1960s .",
    "this is the famous radiochemical chlorine experiment located in the homestake gold mine in south dakota @xcite .",
    "it is made of 615 ton of @xmath20 .",
    "the weak process used for the detection is @xmath21 which has an energy threshold of 0.814 mev .",
    "thus , the event rate measured in the homestake experiment is due mainly to @xmath22 solar neutrinos , with small contributions from @xmath23 and cno neutrinos .",
    "other radiochemical experiments are the gallium experiments gallex / gno @xcite , located in the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso in italy , and sage @xcite , located in an underground laboratory at baksan .",
    "the reaction for the detection is @xmath24 which has an energy threshold of 0.233 mev .",
    "due to such a low energy threshold , the gallium experiments can detect the most abundant neutrinos from the initial @xmath25 reaction in the sun .",
    "the calculated flux in this part of the neutrino spectrum is much less sensitive to the input parameters of the ssm , and thus is more reliable , than that of the @xmath22 neutrinos .",
    "kamiokande @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite are water cherenkov detectors located in the kamioka mine in japan . in these experiments",
    "solar @xmath26 s are detected through the elastic scattering process @xmath27 we use the high - statistics data of the super - kamiokande experiment , which is a 50 kton detector sensitive to @xmath28 solar neutrinos with an energy threshold of about 5 mev .    the sno experiment @xcite is located in sudbury , ontario , canada .",
    "it is a heavy - water cherenkov detector which can make simultaneous measurements of the @xmath28 solar @xmath26 flux and the @xmath29 flux produced by neutrino oscillations through the charged - current and neutral - current interactions on deuterons and the elastic scattering on electrons @xmath30 the first phase of the sno experiment was carried out from nov . 2 , 1999 to jan .",
    "15 , 2001 @xcite using pure @xmath31 . the data collected during this phase allowed the sno collaboration to publish in 2002 @xcite a model - independent evidence of solar @xmath32 transitions . in the second phase , from july 26 , 2001 to aug . 28 , 2003 @xcite",
    ", 2 ton of nacl were added to the @xmath31 target to enhance the detection efficiency of the nc channel .",
    "the sno salt - phase data confirmed the results of the @xmath31 phase , with more precision .",
    "different from the solar neutrino experiments , kamland @xcite is an experiment which detects the antineutrinos produced by the decay of heavy nuclei in commercial japanese and korean nuclear reactors .",
    "it is a 1000 ton liquid scintillator detector located in the kamioka mine in japan .",
    "kamland detects neutrinos though the inverse beta decay process @xmath33 which has a 1.8 mev energy threshold .",
    "kamland is the first experiment which observd a disappearance of reactor @xmath34 s .",
    "the results of the kamland experiment provided a definitive proof in favor of the lma solution of the solar neutrino problem @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we use the 766 ton - years data @xcite .",
    "following the tradition @xcite , we first analyzed the data with a standard least - squares analysis ( often called `` @xmath35 analysis '' ) . in our analysis ,",
    "the least - squares function for each type of solar neutrino experiment is @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are , respectively , the experimental values and theoretical predictions of the observables . the theoretically calculated rates @xmath38 depend on the oscillation parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , @xmath39 is the inverse of the covariance error matrix built by adding in quadrature the statistical and systematic errors , considering mutual correlations .",
    "we have used the data of the homestake , gallex / gno , sage , super - kamiokande and sno solar neutrino experiments . for the global analysis of solar neutrino data",
    ", we define the solar neutrino least - squares function as @xmath40 where we have separated the least - squares function of the radiochemical experiments , in which only the total rate is measured , and those of the super - kamiokande and sno experiments , which measured also the energy spectra in the es and cc reactions .",
    "the initial @xmath28 solar neutrino flux is considered as a free parameter to be determined by the fit , mainly through the sno nc data . for the other solar neutrino fluxes",
    ", we assume the bp04 standard solar model @xcite and treat the uncertainties as described in refs .",

    "the survival probability of the reactor electron antineutrinos can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the reactor - detector distance in meters , @xmath43 is expressed in ev@xmath44 and @xmath45 in mev .",
    "the results of the kamland experiment are divided into 13 energy bins above the threshold . in the analysis of kamland data , we use the least - squares function @xcite @xmath46 + \\frac{(\\eta - 1)^2}{\\sigma_{\\,sys}^2 }",

    "the least - squares function is @xmath51",
    "in the bayesian approach it is assumed that there is some prior knowledge of the values of the parameters to be determined by the data analysis .",
    "this prior knowledge must be quantified by a function which is called `` prior probability distribution function '' ( see refs .",
    "the bayes theorem allows the calculation of the `` posterior probability distribution function '' , which quantifies the knowledge of the values of the parameters provided by the data viewed in the light of the prior knowledge .    in the case of the effective two - neutrino mixing in eq .",
    "( [ mixing ] ) , the parameters to be determined with the statistical analysis of the solar and kamland neutrino data are @xmath52 and @xmath1 .",
    "the bayes theorem says that the posterior probability distribution function of @xmath52 and @xmath1 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the likelihood function and @xmath55 is the prior probability function .",
    "@xmath56 represents the data and @xmath57 represents all the prior general knowledge and assumptions on solar and neutrino physics ( in the bayesian probability theory all probabilities are conditional ) .",
    "the function @xmath58 is the global likelihood , which acts as a normalization constant through the constraint @xmath59 , leading to @xmath60    assuming that the statistical and systematic errors have normal distributions , the likelihood function is given by @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the number of solar data points and @xmath63 is the number of kamland data points .",

    "@xmath66 is the kamland least - squares function in eq .",
    "( [ son ] ) and @xmath67 is the corresponding covariance matrix .",
    "the prior distribution of the parameters , @xmath55 , is a subjective ingredient which quantifies the knowledge on the values of the parameters which is independent from the data to be analyzed . in physics , it is generally considered desirable to assume a prior distribution which carries as little information as possible on the values of the parameters , in order to obtain an unbiased result . in this spirit , we consider a flat prior distribution in the @xmath52@xmath1 plane , @xmath68 in this case , eq .  ( [ bayes1 ] ) becomes @xmath69 using this expression , we obtained , in the @xmath52@xmath1 plane , the credible regions with 90% , 95% and 99.73% posterior probability shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : gaus1 ] shows the 90% , 95% , and 99.73% credible regions for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the value @xmath72 corresponds to a prior belief in favor of a large mixing angle , close to maximal .",
    "the leftmost panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaus1 ] shows that , with respect to the case of a flat prior considered in section  [ sec : bayesian ] , a small value of @xmath73 leads to an enlargement of the credible regions towards large values of @xmath0 , which are allowed by the kamland data , as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bay ] .",
    "the low-@xmath0 part of the credible regions is affected only mildly by the change of prior .",
    "in conclusion , in this section we have shown that the lma solution is stable when reasonable priors are chosen in place of the flat one considered in section  [ sec : bayesian ] , with a possible shrink or enlargement of the large-@xmath0 part of the credible regions depending on a prior belief in favor of a small or large mixing angle .",
    "in this paper , we presented the results of a bayesian analysis of the solar and kamland neutrino data .",
    "we showed that the bayesian analysis with a flat prior distribution in the @xmath52@xmath1 plane leads to an allowed lma region for @xmath74 transitions which practically coincides with the one obtained with a standard least - squares ( @xmath35 ) analysis .",
    "we investigated the stability of the lma allowed region for other reasonable choices of the prior .",
    "we have shown that the lma solution is stable against reasonable variations of the prior , with a possible shrink or enlargement of the large-@xmath0 part of the allowed lma region if one has a prior belief , respectively , in favor of a small or large mixing angle .",
