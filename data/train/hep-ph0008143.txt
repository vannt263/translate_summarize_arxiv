    "<S> the hierarchy between the planck and electroweak scales is related to the large volume of the extra dimensions where only gravity propagates  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the exponential warp factor , obtained imposing four - dimensional poincar invariance , accounts in this case for the hierarchy between the planck and the electroweak scales ( see however ref .  </S>",

    "<S> only gravity is assumed to propagate in the extra dimension . </S>",
    "<S> however the possibility of placing the standard model ( sm ) fields in the five - dimensional bulk has been also considered in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> bulk scalars were analysed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , gauge bosons propagating in the bulk were studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and fermions were included for the first time in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the complete sm living in the bulk has been treated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and a complete parametrization of bulk field masses and their phenomenology can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where supersymmetry is also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the phenomenology of the rs model with the fields living on and off the wall , is reviewed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where experimental bounds and the reach of tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) are studied in detail .    fields living in the five - dimensional bulk can be expanded as a tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) four - dimensional states , with the mass of each level being the ( quantized ) momentum in the transverse dimension . in the case of sm fermions , </S>",
    "<S> chiral zero modes can be obtained using an orbifold projection in the fifth dimension . the rest of the kk tower , however , is necessarily vector - like : the massive modes are dirac particles whose left - handed ( lh ) and right - handed ( rh ) parts transform in the same way under the sm gauge group </S>",
    "<S> . the presence of these extra fermions in the spectrum can induce large mixing between the sm zero modes . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility has been usually neglected arguing the mixing suppression due to the large kk fermion masses @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed experiment tends to banish these kk excitations above @xmath3 , implying at least a suppression of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the electroweak vacuum espectation value </S>",
    "<S> . however , smaller @xmath2 masses are also possible . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it can be shown in the rs model with fermions in the bulk that there is a point in parameter space where the conformal limit is recovered  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the five - dimensional momentum is then conserved and couplings between zero mode fermions and a non - zero mode gauge boson are forbidden . as a result , bounds on the new gauge boson masses coming from electroweak precision data or direct production of kk gauge boson excitations do not apply . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , around this point fermion couplings to the graviton tower remain small . in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the kk excitations could have masses @xmath6 tev or even smaller in this region of parameter space , depending on the ratio between the bulk curvature and the planck mass  @xcite . thus , ignoring quark mixing and the corresponding universality constraints , the experimental information available at present and even after lhc leaves an open window to small kk masses . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the constraints on the mixing induced by bulk fermion excitations . </S>",
    "<S> their contributions to fermion couplings can be readily read from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . there </S>",
    "<S> the sm extension with an arbitrary number of vector - like fermions is considered and the effective lagrangian resulting from integrating them out obtained . using this lagrangian </S>",
    "<S> we show in the following that to keep the quark mixing in the rs model small enough to fulfil universality to few per cent , the lightest kk quark excitation must be heavier than @xmath7 tev in the window around the conformal point . </S>",
    "<S> vector - like quark masses will be also constrained by direct production at lhc . as a matter of fact </S>",
    "<S> , a lower bound of @xmath8 tev will be placed on them if none of such quarks is observed  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , the universality limit derived from the expected precision in the determination of the top couplings at lhc  @xcite is larger by more than a factor of 2 . </S>",
    "<S> this will close the window of small masses , allowing lhc to test crucially the rs ansazt for solving the gauge hierarchy problem . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the consistency of this model with sm fields off the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> it will be shown that all the mixing contributions of the kk fermions have the same sign , with the total sum being dominated by the first excited states . </S>",
    "<S> it seems improbable that other contributions to two - fermion gauge couplings cancel those from kk fermion excitations , which is the largest tree level source for mixing beyond the sm  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first review the rs model to fix our notation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the topology of the fifth dimension is an orbifold @xmath9 of radius r , with two 3-branes sitting on the orbifold fixed points ( @xmath10 for the planck boundary and @xmath11 for the tev boundary ) . </S>",
    "<S> the background metric which satisfies five - dimensional einstein s equations and four - dimensional poincar invariance reads @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 the @xmath1 curvature radius . </S>",
    "<S> the exponential warp factor in the metric reduces the only fundamental scale , the planck mass @xmath15 , to tev scales on the @xmath11 boundary , @xmath16(tev ) provided @xmath17 . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the sm higgs lives on the tev boundary , as it is phenomenologically preferred  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider that the sm fermions live in the bulk since we want to study the effects of their kk excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the sm gauge bosons are also allowed to propagate in the fifth dimension to maintain in general gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> the kk excitations of the gauge bosons can also introduce fermion mixing but this has been discussed elsewhere  @xcite , and we will not study this possibility in detail here .    in five dimensions </S>",
    "<S> there are no chiral fermions . </S>",
    "<S> thus five - dimensional fermions @xmath18 are vector - like and can have a dirac mass of the form @xmath19 where @xmath18 is the sum of the two four - dimensional `` chiralities '' @xmath20 , transforming in the same way under the gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the rs background @xmath21 and @xmath22 must have opposite parities under the @xmath23 symmetry @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the dirac mass must present a kink profile and can be parametrized as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a free parameter determining the location of the zero mode  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ xdl1 ] ) is proportional to @xmath127 and the bound on @xmath128 is reduced by a factor @xmath129 , varying from 0.2 to 1.1 tev for 0.45 @xmath130 0.55 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the unitarity condition @xmath131 is satisfied to few per mille  @xcite , but the new contributions in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ wl1 ] ) are proportional to @xmath132 and to @xmath133 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the corresponding limits on @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( equal to @xmath113 for a unique @xmath46 ) are further suppressed by a small mass and by small mixing angles times small masses , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> if each type of quark has a different location , the same limits on @xmath136 above apply . </S>",
    "<S> ( the bound on @xmath137 is equal to the @xmath134 limit if @xmath138 is measured with the same precision as @xmath114 . ) again , as we are only interested in the most stringent bound on the common factor @xmath139 , the limit on @xmath140 from the precise measurement of @xmath114 is enough for closing the open window in the rs model with the sm fields off the wall .    </S>",
    "<S> if we allow different quarks to be located at different points of the fifth dimension ( which could explain the fermion mass hierarchy  @xcite ) and then for non - diagonal @xmath99 corrections , one must wonder about possibly large fcnc and cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> these can originate from the exchange of kk gauge bosons  @xcite and from mixing with kk fermions . in the first case </S>",
    "<S> the effective scale must be very large ( or as above , the first two families must be almost at the same location or in the region of equal coupling , @xmath141 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested , however , in the effects of quark mixing induced by the tower of vector - like quarks with different family location . in this case fcnc and cp violation are not too large due to the scaling of the @xmath87 corrections with the quark masses @xmath142 ( see eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xul1]-[xdr1 ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is enough to suppress those effects below experimental limits if we require @xmath114 to agree with its sm value at lhc . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , @xmath143 , with @xmath144_k$ ] and @xmath145 and @xmath146_k$ ] positive . </S>",
    "<S> then the limits above apply for some @xmath147 because not all mixing elements vanish . </S>",
    "<S> ( similar arguments apply for @xmath88 but with small mixing angles ( see eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ wl1 ] , [ wr1 ] ) ) . ) </S>",
    "<S> this kind of behaviour has been usually assumed in sm extensions with vector - like quarks ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references there in ) . </S>",
    "<S> the models with extra dimensions realize naturally this scaling , introducing an infinite tower of exotic fermions with contributions dominated by the lightest states . a detailed study of fcnc and cp violation and their different origins will be presented elsewhere .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that if fermions are allowed to live in the bulk of the rs model , mixing effects between the sm fermions and the tower of their kk ( vector - like ) excitations can be important . in the conformal limit region </S>",
    "<S> , this mixing gives a strong constraint , even in the absence of fcnc . at this point , other experimental tests ( including both electroweak precision measurements and direct collider searches ) provide smaller lower bounds from the decoupling of the towers of gauge bosons and gravitons . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the inclusion of quark mixing in the phenomenological study of models with extra dimensions results in a significant improvement of the experimental constraints , allowing to completely cover the parameter space up to scales of the order of several tev . </S>"
