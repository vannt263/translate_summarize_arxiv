    "light nuclear systems show many different properties in the structure . around the low - lying energy region ,",
    "the mean field and the associated shell structure are dominant properties , however cluster structures appear close to their decay thresholds . in this context , an @xmath1-particle , which is strongly bound and an @xmath1-@xmath1 interaction is not strong enough to make a bound state , can be considered as an effective building block of the structure of light nuclei @xcite .",
    "one of the typical examples of cluster structures is the second @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) state of @xmath0c at @xmath7 mev just above the 3@xmath1-threshold energy .",
    "this state is considered to have an exotic cluster structure of 3@xmath1 in analogy with the so - called  mysterious @xmath5 state \" of @xmath8o at @xmath9 mev , which has a @xmath0c+@xmath1 cluster structure and is hardly explained by a simple shell - model picture .",
    "the @xmath6 state plays a crucial role in synthesis of @xmath0c from three @xmath10he nuclei in stars @xcite , and the state has been proven to contain a developed 3@xmath1-configuration by many microscopic cluster calculations @xcite , which is a gas - like state without a specific geometrical - shape .",
    "this state is recently reinterpreted as an @xmath1-condensed state @xcite .    to prove the existence of cluster states",
    ", recently it has been proposed that the strong enhancement of isoscalar monopole ( e0 ) transitions can be a measure of the cluster structure @xcite .",
    "for instance , the presence of the cluster states in @xmath11c has been suggested by measuring the isoscalar e0 transitions from the ground @xmath12 state induced by the @xmath11c@xmath13c reaction @xcite .",
    "the obtained crosssections are much larger than those of the shell - model calculations , which suggest that protons and neutrons are coherently excited and they have spatially extended distribution in the excited states .    from the theoretical side , the relation between the monopole transition strength and the cluster structure has also been discussed @xcite . the basic idea arises from the bayman - bohr theorem @xcite , which shows that the lowest representation of the shell - model contains a component of the lowest @xmath3 representation of the cluster states .",
    "thus , even cluster states with spatially extended distribution , such as the second @xmath5 state of @xmath0c , can be generated by multiplying operators to the shell - model - like ground state .",
    "the monopole operator is the very one which induces the spatial extension of the ground state and connects it to cluster states by raising the quanta of the cluster - cluster relative wave function by two .",
    "the monopole matrix element of @xmath0c ( @xmath14 ) calculated with the cluster model agrees with the experimental value ( 5.4@xmath150.2 @xmath16 for proton part @xcite ) , and this is much larger than that given in the @xmath17-shell single particle models .",
    "this is one of supports for the proposal that strong monopole transition can be a signature of 4@xmath18 correlated states from the theoretical side .",
    "it is also discussed that the mixing of the cluster component in the ground state is another important factor for the enhancement of the monopole transition strength to cluster states @xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "the relation between the monopole transition strength and existence of well - developed cluster structure in the excited states is discussed based on an algebraic cluster model .",
    "the structure of @xmath0c is studied with a 3@xmath1 model , and the wave functions for the relative motions between @xmath1 clusters are described by the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis states forming symplectic algebra .",
    "the importance of the symplectic structure for light nuclei has been investigated also in @xcite , and the relation between the symplectic algebra and the cluster model has been discussed . in our study , we focus on the relation between the symplectic structure and monopole transition strength . as a final goal of this study , we aim to treat the solution of the unbound states in a correct way and explicitly impose the boundary conditions in outer region . for this purpose",
    ", it is necessary to introduce basis states with large principal quantum numbers for the relative motion of clusters , but the number of the basis states drastically increases with increasing principal quantum numbers if we adopt @xmath3 algebra .",
    "this problem is overcome by introducing symplectic algebra @xmath2 , where the basis states correspond to the linear combinations of @xmath3 states with different multiplicities .",
    "this @xmath2 algebra can be a powerful tool to create the states corresponding to the excitation modes of relative motions between @xmath1 clusters .",
    "the cluster states with @xmath3 representations which have different total ho quanta are connected by a common eigenvalue @xmath4 of the @xmath2 algebra , and it will be shown that strong monopole transitions are classified by this @xmath4 .",
    "it is also discussed that limited values ( small values ) of @xmath4 are enough to achieve good convergence for the states corresponding to the excitation modes of the clusters @xcite . because of this effect , we can adopt states with large values of the ho quanta into the model space in this study .    the outline of this paper is given as follows .",

    "the states with the parentheses ( @xmath144 ) are obtained as bound state approximation but do not show the behavior of stationary solutions . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these characters are deduced from the calculated root mean square radii ( @xmath142 ) and probabilities of each @xmath145 configuration listed in table [ tab : state12c ] .",
    "the gas - like states are characterized by the large @xmath142 value , and since the wave function is dilutely distributed , it has components of various @xmath145 configurations .",
    "for instance , the @xmath146 state ( @xmath101= 2.73 mev ) is considered to have the gas - like nature .",
    "although a candidate has been reported @xcite , the excited states of the hoyle state have not been experimentally confirmed .",
    "on the other hand , the linear - chain states are characterized by large overlap with @xmath147 configurations .",
    "the @xmath5 state at @xmath126 5.12 mev obtained within the present framework contains the characteristics of linear - chain configuration .",
    "we can see that the amount of the linear - chain component decreases as @xmath33 increase .",
    "moreover , the stationary point of energy convergence indicates that the linear - chain structures tend to have relatively large decay widths than the gas - like states .",
    "therefore , the clear rotational band structure can not be seen in the present calculation .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the relation between the monopole transition strength of @xmath0c and the special algebraic structure to investigate the large strength including the one for @xmath0c ( @xmath14 ) . here",
    ", we have focused on the similarity of the monopole operator and the generators of the @xmath19 algebra .",
    "the model space is constructed based on the @xmath19 algebra , and the ladder states were generated from the band head states given by the @xmath3 representation .",
    "we have found that the large contribution for the monopole transition strength can be explained from the properties of the generators of @xmath19 and the ground state .",
    "we have been able to discuss the mechanism that the monopole strengths are closely related to the @xmath4 value of the final states . here , the importance of the @xmath4 ladder state which is the same as the ground state ( @xmath118 ) has been discussed .",
    "we found that the overall behavior of the monopole strength is given by the amount of @xmath118 configuration .",
    "however , the detailed value is sensitive to the properties of the wave function , where we have seen these values as a function of the @xmath18-quanta of harmonic oscillator .",
    "we have also seen that the mechanism appears even in the linear - chain like @xmath5 state where the small amount of @xmath118 configuration exists .",
    "we have also checked the stability of these states to select the candidates for the resonance states . for this purpose",
    ", we have investigated the behavior of the energy convergence with respect to the @xmath18-quanta of harmonic oscillator .",
    "we have also analysed whether the obtained states have gas - like or linear - chain structure , and the candidate for the excited hoyle state ( @xmath73 ) has been found .    since",
    "our wave functions are constructed from purely pauli allowed states , the applicability for further analyses is quite large .",
    "for instance , applying non hermitian formalism by taking correct boundary condition based on complex scaling method ( csm ) @xcite is feasible . in the forthcoming paper",
    ", we will construct the formalism which can be combined with csm .",
    "the present analysis is an important first step for the analysis along this line .",
