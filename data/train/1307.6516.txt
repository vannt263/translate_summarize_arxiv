    "this difference is probably due to the strongly anisotropic angular distribution , which has been studied experimentally by just one group  @xcite .",

    "an earlier @xmath0ca(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3ti angular distribution measurement by the same group included one ge(li ) detector as a yield monitor and a second ge(li ) at a target distance of just 4 cm for the measurement  @xcite .",
    "it seems prudent to assume a 10% uncertainty for the angular corrections derived on the basis of these previous works  @xcite .",
    "taking into account which uncertainties are common and which are individual to the data point and method used , a global average for the total strength of the triplet of 8.4@xmath680.6ev is found ( tables  [ table : totalresonancestrength ] and  [ table : literaturereview ] ) .      from an experimental point of view , the triplet can be treated as one composite resonance due to the negligible difference in the squared de broglie wavelength . for an astrophysical scenario ,",

    "therefore it is useful to understand how much strength each resonance of the triplet contributes individually .",
    "based on the in - beam data and on the total resonance strength ( table  [ table : totalresonancestrength ] ) , the individual strengths for the three resonances included in the triplet have been computed ( table  [ table : triplet_resonance_strenghts ] ) .",
