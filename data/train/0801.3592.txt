    "* theorem 20 ) that @xmath14 hence the lmi set @xmath15 is basic semialgebraic : it is the intersection of polynomial sublevel sets . from linearity of @xmath16 and convexity of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices",
    ", it also follows that @xmath15 is convex .",
    "hence lmi sets are _ convex basic semialgebraic_.    , title=\"fig:\",width=566 ] +    one may then wonder whether all convex basic semialgebraic sets are lmi . in @xcite , helton and vinnikov answer by the negative , showing that in the plane ( @xmath1 ) some convex basic semialgebraic sets can not be lmi .",
    "an elementary example is the so - called tv screen set defined by the fermat quartic @xmath17 see figure [ tv_screen ] .",
    "assume that the set @xmath15 defined in ( [ lmi ] ) has a non - empty interior , and choose a point @xmath18 in this interior , i.e. @xmath19 where @xmath20 means positive definite .",
    "a segment starting from @xmath18 attains the boundary of @xmath15 when the determinant @xmath21 vanishes .",
    "the remaining polynomial inequalities @xmath22 , @xmath23 only isolate the convex connected component containing @xmath18 .",
    "this motivated helton and vinnikov @xcite to study semialgebraic sets defined by a single polynomial inequality @xmath24 the set @xmath25 is called an algebraic interior with defining polynomial @xmath3 , and it is equal to @xmath26 when @xmath5 is convex . with these notations , the question addressed in @xcite is as follows : what are the conditions satisfied by a polynomial @xmath3 so that @xmath5 is an lmi set ?    for notational simplicity we will assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath27 , so that @xmath5 contains the origin , and hence we can normalize @xmath3 so that @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 for some matrix mapping @xmath16 we say that @xmath3 has a determinantal representation .",
    "in particular , the polynomial @xmath30 in ( [ basic ] ) has a symmetric linear determinantal representation .",
    "consider an lmi set @xmath15 as in ( [ lmi ] ) and define @xmath31 as the determinant of the symmetric pencil @xmath16 .",
    "note that @xmath32 , the dimension of @xmath16 .",
    "define the algebraic variety @xmath33 and notice that the boundary of @xmath15 is included in @xmath6 . indeed , a point @xmath34 along the boundary of @xmath15 is such that the rank of @xmath35 vanishes .",
    "since the origin belongs to @xmath15 it holds @xmath36 .",
    "now consider a line passing through the origin , parametrized as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a parameter and @xmath39 is any vector with unit norm .",
    "for all @xmath40 , the symmetric matrix @xmath41 has only real eigenvalues as a pencil of @xmath42 , and its determinant @xmath43 has only real roots .",
    "therefore , a given polynomial level set @xmath5 as in ( [ poly ] ) is lmi only if the polynomial @xmath44 has only real roots for all @xmath40 , it must satisfy the so - called _ real zero condition _ @xcite .",
    "geometrically it means that a generic line passing through the origin must intersect the variety ( [ var ] ) at @xmath45 real points .",
    "the set @xmath5 is then called _ rigidly convex _ , a geometric property implying convexity .",
    "a striking result of @xcite is that rigid convexity is also a sufficient condition for a polynomial level set to be an lmi set in the plane , i.e. when @xmath1 .",
    "for example , it can be checked easily that the tv screen set ( [ tv ] ) is not rigidly convex since a generic line cuts the quartic curve only twice .    in the litterature on partial differential equations , polynomials satisfying real zero condition",
    "are also called hyperbolic polynomials , and the corresponding lmi set is called the hyperbolicity cone , see @xcite for a survey , and @xcite for connections between real zero and hyperbolic polynomials .    in passing ,",
    "note the fundamental distinction between an lmi set ( as defined above ) and a semidefinite representable set , as defined in @xcite .",
    "a semidefinite representable set is the projection of an lmi set : @xmath46 where the variables @xmath47 , sometimes called liftings , are instrumental to the construction of the set through an extended pencil @xmath48 .",
    "such a set is called a lifted lmi set .",
    "it is convex semialgebraic , but in general it is not basic .",
    "however , it can be expressed as a union of basic semialgebraic sets . in the case of the tv screen set ( [ tv ] )",
    "a lifted lmi representation follows from the extended pencil @xmath49\\ ] ] obtained by introducing two liftings .",
    "it seems that the problem of knowing which convex semialgebraic sets are semidefinite representable is still mostly open , see @xcite for recent developments .",
    "once rigid convexity of a plane set , or equivalently the real zero property of its defining polynomial , is established , the next step is constructing an lmi representation .",
    "algebraically , given a real zero bivariate polynomial @xmath50 of degree @xmath11 , the problem consists in finding symmetric matrices @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 of dimension @xmath11 such that @xmath54 and @xmath36 .",
    "if the @xmath55 are symmetric complex - valued matrices , this is a well - studied problem of algebraic geometry called _ determinantal representation _ , see @xcite for a classical reference and @xcite for more recent surveys and extensions to trivariate polynomials .",
    "if one relaxes the dimension constraint ( allowing the @xmath55 to have dimension larger than @xmath11 ) and the symmetry constraint ( allowing the @xmath55 to be non - symmetric ) , then results from linear systems state - space realization theory ( in particular linear fractional representations , lfrs ) can be invoked to design computer algorithms solving constructively the determinantal representation problem .",
    "for example , the lfr toolbox for matlab @xcite is a user - friendly package allowing to find non - symmetric determinantal representations :    .... > > lfrs x1 x2 > > f=1/(1-x1",

    "now if one insists on having symmetric @xmath55 of minimal dimension @xmath11 , then two essentially equivalent constructive procedures are known in the bivariate case to derive hermitian complex - valued @xmath55 from a defining polynomial @xmath50 of degree @xmath11 .",
    "real symmetric solutions must then be extracted from the set of complex hermitian solutions .    the first one is based on the construction of a basis for the riemann - roch space of complete linear systems of the algebraic plane curve @xmath6 given in ( [ var ] ) .",

    "the focus of this paper is mostly on computational methods and numerical algorithms .",
    "the contribution is twofold .",
    "first in section [ rigid ] we describe an algorithm for detecting rigid convexity in the plane . given a bivariate polynomial @xmath50 , the algorithm uses a hybrid symbolic - numerical method to detect whether the connected component of the sublevel set ( [ poly ] ) containing the origin is rigidly convex .",
    "the problem boils down to deciding whether a univariate polynomial matrix is positive semidefinite .",
    "this is a well - known problem in linear systems theory , for which numerical linear algebra algorithms are available ( namely eigenvalue decomposition ) , as well as a ( more expensive but more flexible ) semidefinite programming formulation .",
    "then in section [ rational ] we describe an algorithm for solving the determinantal representation problem for algebraic plane curves of genus zero .",
    "the algorithm is essentially symbolic , using bzoutians , but it assumes that a rational parametrization of the curve is available . the idea behind the algorithm is not new , and can be traced back to @xcite , as surveyed recently in @xcite .",
    "an algorithm for detecting rigid convexity of a connected component delimited by such curves readily follows .",
    "extensions to positive genus algebraic plane curves and higher dimensional sets are mentioned in section [ extensions ] .",
    "in particular we survey the case of cubic plane curves and cubic surfaces which are well understood .",
    "the case of quartic ( and higher degree ) curves seems to be mostly open , and computer implementations of determinantal representations are still missing .",
    "similarly , checking rigid convexity in higher dimensions seems to be computational challenging since it amounts to deciding whether a multivariate polynomial matrix is positive semidefinite .",
    "in this section we design an algorithm to assess whether the connected component delimited by a bivariate polynomial around the origin is rigidly convex .",
    "the idea is elementary and consists in formulating algebraically the geometric condition of rigid convexity of the set @xmath5 defined in ( [ poly ] ) : a line passing through the origin cuts the algebraic curve @xmath6 defined in ( [ var ] ) a number of times which is equal to the total degree @xmath11 of the defining bivariate polynomial @xmath59    a line passing through the origin can be parametrized as : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 . along this line",
