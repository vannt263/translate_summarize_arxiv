    "recently , a lot of attentions are focused on the study of the azimuthal anisotropy of the particle production in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "this anisotropy is usually expanded into a fourier series : @xmath12 with @xmath0 and @xmath13 represent the magnitude and direction of @xmath14-order anisotropy , respectively . at low @xmath11 , @xmath0 is driven by the anisotropic pressure gradient associated with the initial spatial asymmetries , with more particles emitted in the direction of largest gradients  @xcite .",
    "asymmetries giving rise to non - zero @xmath0 are associated with either average shape ( for @xmath6 ) or shapes arising from spatial fluctuations of the participating nucleons  @xcite .",
    "they can be characterized by a set of multi - pole components ( also known as `` eccentricities '' ) at different angular scale , calculated from the participating nucleons at @xmath15  @xcite : @xmath16 the orientations of the minor axis for each moment @xmath17 , also known as the participant plane ( pp ) are given by @xmath18 when fluctuations are small and linearized hydrodynamics is applicable , each moment of the flow @xmath0 is expected to be independently driven by @xmath19 along @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "this may not be true when the fluctuations are large , as the non - linear effects may lead to significant mixing between harmonic flow of different order  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", they are assumed to be the same to facilitate the study of the correlations between @xmath13 of different physics origins .    at high @xmath11 ( @xmath21 )",
    "gev , the @xmath0 is understood to be driven by the path - length dependent energy loss of jets traversing the medium , with more particles emitted along the direction of shortest path - length ( or direction of smallest jet attenuation )  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to flow which is sensitive to the global geometry manifested through the global evolution of the created matter , this anisotropy is more sensitive to the local density experienced by the jets as they traverse the matter .",
    "nevertheless , since both flow and jet quenching are influenced by the same geometry , the directions of largest pressure gradient for flow and direction of smallest jet attenuation are strongly correlated .",
    "in fact , they are often implicitly assumed to be the same in many theoretical calculations  @xcite .",
    "an explicit study of the correlation between the two directions can help clarifying this assumption .    in this paper , we estimate the high-@xmath11 anisotropy coefficients @xmath0 and their associated directions @xmath22 ( qp stands for `` quenching plane '' ) using a simple jet absorption model with event by event fluctuating glauber geometry .",
    "we study the correlations between @xmath23 and @xmath22 , and discuss implications of these correlations for the interpretation of the `` ridge '' phenomena in two - particle correlations ( 2pc ) .",
    "we use a simple jet absorption / glauber model of ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate @xmath0 and @xmath22 .",
    "this model has been used previously to study the centrality and path - length dependence of single particle suppression @xmath24 , dihadron suppression @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "back - to - back jet pairs are generated according to the binary collision density profile ( @xmath27 ) in the transverse ( @xmath28 ) plane with random orientation .",
    "they are then propagated through the medium , whose density is given by the participant density profile ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "both profiles are generated with a monte carlo glauber model with event by event fluctuation of positions of nucleons in au ions  @xcite .",
    "the nucleons are sampled from a woods - saxon distribution with a radius of 6.38 fm and diffuseness of 0.535 fm , with a nucleon - nucleon cross - section of @xmath30  mb . in order to have smooth distributions for @xmath27 and @xmath29 ,",
    "the nucleons are assumed to have a gaussian profile in transverse plane with a width of @xmath31  fm in @xmath32 and @xmath33 direction similar to ref  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath34 is varied from 0.2 - 0.4  fm , and the nucleon is also assumed to be a uniform disk with a radius of @xmath35  fm . however the final results are found to be insensitive to the details of the nucleon shape , except in peripheral collisions .",
    "the jet quenching is implemented via exponential attenuation @xmath36 , where the matter integral @xmath37 is calculated as @xmath38 for jet generated at @xmath39 and propagated along direction @xmath40 .",
    "they corresponds to @xmath41 dependence of absorption ( @xmath42 ) in a longitudinal expanding or 1 + 1d medium ( @xmath43 ) with a thermalization time of @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45 is fixed to 0 by default , but we have checked the @xmath0 do not change much for @xmath46  fm  @xcite .",
    "the two cases , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , are motivated for the @xmath49 dependence expected for radiative and ads / cft energy loss in 1 + 1d medium  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the absorption coefficient @xmath50 controls the jet quenching strength and is the only parameter in this calculation .",
    "it is tuned to reproduce @xmath51 for 0 - 5% @xmath52 data at rhic after averaging over many glauber events  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a value of @xmath53  @xmath54 and 0.0968  @xmath55 for @xmath47 and 2 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] summarize the basic information obtained from this procedure for one typical au - au event in 0 - 5% centrality interval .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) shows the density profile for @xmath29 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "panel ( c ) shows the normalized probability distribution of @xmath56 : @xmath57 , which is obtained by calculating @xmath56 over all possible di - jet production point @xmath27 and jet propagation direction @xmath58 .",
    "this distribution exhibit characteristic high density and low density regions in @xmath59 space , presumably reflecting spatial correlation between the @xmath27 and @xmath29 profiles .",
    "panel ( d ) shows the normalized probability distribution of the attenuation @xmath60 .",
    "panel ( e ) shows the @xmath61 averaged along the y - axis in panel ( d ) as a function @xmath58 , which is precisely the azimuthal angle dependent suppression @xmath62 .",
    "a clear anti - correlation can be seen between the peak magnitude of the @xmath62 and breadth of the @xmath56 distribution in panel ( c ) .",
    "this distribution can also be obtained by randomly generating many di - jet pairs according the @xmath27 and propagating them through @xmath29 via eq .",
    "we expand it into a fourier series : @xmath63 where @xmath64 represents the average suppression , @xmath65 and @xmath4 represent the magnitude and direction of @xmath3-order harmonic of emission probability distribution , respectively .",
    "similar studies of @xmath62 were pursued before in ref .",
    "@xcite for a pqcd energy loss in a event by event hydrodynamic underlying event .",
    "however it focused primarily on the influence of fluctuations on the event - averaged @xmath62 distribution relative to the @xmath66-order event plane ( ep ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] ( f ) shows a distribution calculated from @xmath19 and @xmath4 : @xmath67 it visualizes the shape of the initial geometry that is transformed into the final momentum anisotropy via either flow or jet quenching .",
    "a good alignment is seen between @xmath9 and @xmath4 for @xmath68 .",
    "it also shows that the large @xmath19 for @xmath2 are strongly damped after jet absorption , leading to very small values of @xmath69 for @xmath2 .    the study shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] can be repeated for many events .",
    "we divide the simulation data into 5% centrality intervals , each containing about 2500 events .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the distribution of @xmath70 for two centrality intervals .",
    "strong positive correlations are obtained for @xmath1 , 2 and 3 , while the correlations are rather weak or even become negative for @xmath2   in eq .",
    "is calculated with @xmath71 weighting .",
    "we have also repeated the study using @xmath72 weighting for @xmath73 and @xmath74 weighing for @xmath1  @xcite , but very little differences are seen . ] .    in heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc , the @xmath0",
    "is usually measured from particle distribution relative to @xmath75 via eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ]  @xcite .",
    "however it has also been derived from the fourier coefficients of two - particle correlation in relative azimuthal angle @xmath76  @xcite : @xmath77 with @xmath78 the fact that the quenching plane and participant plane do not align exactly with each other implies that the @xmath0 measured relative to @xmath23 is not the same as those contributing to the 2pc in eq .",
    "[ eq:6a ] . in other words , it is possible that the @xmath0 obtained from single particle analysis is only a fraction of the true anisotropy resulting from jet quenching : @xmath79 since what is measured in experiment is the event plane not the pp , it is important to check whether the event plane align with qp or not , for example in a hydrodynamic model calculation .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] ( a ) and ( c ) summarize the centrality dependence of @xmath65 for @xmath16 and for @xmath56 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "significant @xmath69 signals are observed for @xmath8 , while higher - order @xmath69 are usually smaller than 1% .",
    "the @xmath81 and @xmath82@xmath83 all show strong centrality dependence , while the @xmath84 and @xmath85 show little centrality dependence for @xmath86 .",
    "interestingly , the value of the @xmath84 is consistently larger than that for @xmath85 , and it even exceeds @xmath81 value in most central collisions .",
    "this behavior suggest that the path - length dependence of energy loss and initial dipole asymmetry from fluctuations corroborate to produce a large @xmath84 .",
    "this large @xmath84 is expect to contribute to the high-@xmath11 @xmath87 signal observed by the atlas collaboration  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] also shows that the @xmath80 type of path - length dependence induces significantly larger @xmath69 than that for @xmath56 : the increase is almost a factor of two for @xmath1 and @xmath88 .",
    "this is also observed in other studies before  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] ( b ) and ( d ) summarize the centrality dependence of @xmath89 for @xmath90 and for @xmath56 and @xmath80 , respectively . as indicated by eq .",
    "[ eq:7 ] , this represents the reduction factor of the @xmath0 when it is measured relative to the @xmath9 .",
    "the reduction is small for @xmath6 , except in central collisions where it reaches 15% for @xmath56 and 30% for @xmath80 .",
    "however the reduction is significantly larger for @xmath1 and 3 , reaching about 50% for @xmath1 in mid - central collisions .",
    "the @xmath89 value becomes negative for @xmath2 in central collisions , reflecting an anti - correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath4 ( already shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , @xmath89 values for @xmath1 are always smaller than that for @xmath88 ( more misalignment ) , while @xmath84 is always larger than @xmath85 .",
    "the dispersion between the @xmath4 and @xmath9 has important implications on the factorization relation eq .",
    "[ eq:6b ] .",
    "the factorization of @xmath10 into @xmath0 is obviously valid for correlations between two low @xmath11 particles ( soft - soft correlation ) as both are modulated around @xmath9 .",
    "the factorization should also be valid for correlation between a low-@xmath11 particle and a high-@xmath11 particle ( soft - hard correlation ) since it involves the projection of the @xmath0 onto @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath91 .",
    "experimental data indeed support this  @xcite . however",
    "the correlation between two high-@xmath11 particles from two independent hard - scattering processes ( hard - hard correlation ) is expected to be larger than the product of the two single particle @xmath0 : @xmath92 therefore , the factorization can not work simultaneously for soft - soft , soft - hard and hard - hard correlations .",
    "the large anisotropy coefficients @xmath69 also has important consequences for the `` ridge '' observed in two - particle correlations  @xcite .",
    "this `` ridge '' is understood to be the result of the constructive contribution of harmonics at @xmath93 . in the literature ,",
    "it is referred to as either the `` soft - ridge ''  @xcite for soft - soft correlation or `` hard - ridge ''  @xcite for soft - hard correlation , respectively . here",
    "we show that the correlation between two independently produced high-@xmath11 jets can also produce the `` ridge''-like structure .",
    "this `` hard - hard ridge '' can be calculated on a probability basis event - by - event by simply self - convoluting the @xmath62 distribution like fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( e ) .",
    "examples of these structures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] for two representative events in both 0 - 5% and 20 - 25% centrality intervals .",
    "the magnitude of the ridge , as well as the away - side shape changes dramatically from event to event .",
    "they also changes a lot between the @xmath56 and @xmath80 types of path - length dependence jet absorption .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] show the long - range structures ( solid lines ) obtained from the jet absorption model , averaged over many events .",
    "the ridge magnitude increases with centrality to about 1.5% ( 4% ) for @xmath56 ( @xmath80 ) path - length dependence in mid - central collisions",
    ". this signal should be measurable with the large statistics dataset from lhc .",
    "the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] show the 2pc predicted from the @xmath0 measured relative to @xmath9 .",
    "clearly the misalignments between @xmath4 and @xmath9 reduces the ridge magnitude .",
    "the reduction is almost 50% in most central collisions , but decrease to about 20% in mid - central collisions .",
    "this suggests the difference between the measured ridge and those predicted by the event plane method could be large and measurable .",
    "the anisotropy of high-@xmath11 particle is studied in a simple jet absorption framework with event by event fluctuating geometry .",
    "the harmonic coefficients @xmath94 are found to be significant for @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) but become very small for @xmath2 .",
    "the correlation between the quenching plane and participant plane are studied .",
    "a strong de - correlation is found for @xmath6 in central collisions and for @xmath1 and @xmath97 over the full centrality range .",
    "the correlations become negative for @xmath2 in central collisions . this de - correlation ,",
    "if also confirmed between the event plane and the quenching plane ( e.g via hydrodynamic model that has dijets embeded ) , is expected to break the global factorization of the two particle fourier coefficient @xmath10 into the @xmath0 for the two single particles .",
    "it would also imply that the high-@xmath11 @xmath0 measured relative to the event plane could be significantly smaller than the true anisotropy from path - length dependent jet energy loss .",
    "these jet quenching @xmath0 also give rise to long range `` ridge '' structure in two - particle correlations .",
    "the predicted ridge amplitude is on the order of 0.5 - 4% depending on the centrality and functional form of the @xmath49 dependence of the energy loss , and should be measurable at the lhc using the correlations between two high-@xmath11 particles with a large rapidity separation .",
    "our study bear some similarities to ref .",
    "@xcite . however , ref .",
    "@xcite uses a cumulant expansion framework instead of monte carlo glauber model for initial geometry , and that it focus on the soft - hard ridge instead of the hard - hard ridge in our case .",
