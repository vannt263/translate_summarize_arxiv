    "this is the second of a series of papers in which we try to classify four dimensional @xmath0 superconformal field theories ( scfts ) using classification of singularity .",
    "this program has several interesting features :    * the classification of field theory is reduced to the classification of singularities , which in many cases are much simpler than the classification using field theory tools . *",
    "many highly non - trivial physical questions such as coulomb branch spectrum and the seiberg - witten solution @xcite can be easily found by studying the mini - versal deformation of the singularity .    in @xcite , we conjecture that any three dimensional rational gorenstein graded isolated singularity should define a @xmath0 scft .",
    "a complete list of hypersurface singularities was obtained in @xcite , and this immediately gives us a large number of new four dimensional @xmath0 scfts .",
    "the natural next step is to classify three dimensional rational weighted homogeneous isolated complete intersection singularities ( icis ) . to our surprise",
    ", the space of such singularities is also very rich , and we succeed in giving a complete classification .",
    "let s summarize our major findings :    * the number of polynomials defining icis is two , i.e. the singularity is defined as @xmath1 . * we find a total of 303 class of singularities , and some of them consist only finite number of models , but we do get many infinite sequences .",
    "our classification gives many new interesting 4d @xmath0 scfts .",
    "some of these singularities describe the familiar gauge theory , i.e. the singularity @xmath2 describes the affine @xmath3 quiver gauge theory with su type gauge group , see figure .",
    "the major purpose of this paper is to describe the classification , and more detailed study of the corresponding scfts will appear in a different publication .",
    "scft described by the singularity @xmath2 . here",
    "the gauge group is @xmath4.,width=192 ]    this paper is organized as follows : section two reviews the connection between the physics of 4d @xmath0 scft and the property of icis ; section iii reviews some preliminary facts about the general property of singularities ; section iv proves that the maximal embedding dimension of 3d rational icis is five , and section v classifies the general weighted homogeneous icis and we also compute the milnor number and the monomial basis of the mini - versal deformations .",
    "four dimensional @xmath0 scft has an important @xmath5 r symmetry .",
    "these theories have half bps scalar operators @xmath6 which can get expectation value and parameterize the coulomb branch , here @xmath7 is the @xmath8 charge and this operator is a singlet under @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "the scaling dimension of operator @xmath6 is @xmath10 , and if @xmath11 , one can turn on the relevant deformation @xmath12 the scaling dimension of the coupling constant is determined by the relation @xmath13 + [ { \\cal e}_{r,(0,0)}]=2 $ ] .",
    "the coupling constants do not lift the coulomb branch , but will change the infrared physics , so we need to include those coupling constants besides the expectation values of @xmath6 to parameterize the coulomb branch .",
    "we also have the dimension one mass parameters @xmath14 which can also change the ir physics , which should also be included as the parameters of coulomb branch . to solve the coulomb branch of a @xmath0 scft , we need to achieve the following two goals :    * determine the set of rational numbers which include the scaling dimension of the coupling constants @xmath15 , coulomb branch operators @xmath6 , and mass parameters @xmath14 . @xmath16",
    "since the scaling dimension of the coupling constant is paired with that of coulomb branch operator , this set is symmetric with respect to identity .",
    "* once we find out the parameters on the coulomb branch , we want to write down a seiberg - witten curve which describes the low energy effective theory on the coulomb branch @xmath17 here @xmath18 includes all the parameters discussed above .",
    "these two questions are central in understanding coulomb branch of a @xmath0 scft , and in general are quite hard to answer .",
    "if our 4d scft is engineered using 3-fold singularity , the above two questions can be found from the miniversal deformation of the singularity .",
    "the formulae for the hypersurface case has been given in @xcite . in the following , we will review the relevant formulas for icis case , which is first derived in @xcite .",
    "consider a three dimensional icis defined by two polynomials @xmath19 , where@xmath20 is the map @xmath21 .",
    "we require the defining polynomials to have a manifest @xmath22 action , which is proportional to the @xmath8 symmetry of the field theory .",
    "we normalize the @xmath22 action so that the weights of the coordinates @xmath23 are @xmath24 , and the degree of @xmath25 is one , the degree of @xmath26 is d : @xmath27 this singularity has a distinguished @xmath28 form : @xmath29 which has charge @xmath30 under the @xmath22 action . to define a sensible 4d scft",
    ", we require this charge to be positive , which means that @xmath31 we conjecture that this condition is necessary and sufficient to define a scft .",
    "such singularity is called rational singularity , see section iii for the definition .",
    "the sw solution is described by the mini - versal deformation of the singularity : @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the monomial basis of the jacobi module of @xmath20 , and @xmath34 is the milnor number . the coefficient @xmath35 is identified with the parameters on coulomb branch .",
    "the scaling dimension of @xmath35 is determined by requiring @xmath36 to have dimension one as its integration over the middle homology cycle of milnor fibration gives the mass of bps particle , and we have @xmath37:~~[\\lambda_{\\alpha}]={1-q_{\\alpha}\\over \\sum w_i-1-d } , \\nonumber\\\\ & \\phi_{\\alpha}=[0,\\phi_{\\alpha}]:~~[\\lambda_{\\alpha}]={d - q_{\\alpha}\\over \\sum w_i-1-d}. \\label{spectrum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath38 is the @xmath22 charge of the monomial @xmath33 .",

    "* exact marginal deformations if @xmath39=0 $ ] .",
    "these deformations are related to the moduli of the singularity . *",
    "irrelevant deformations if @xmath39<0 $ ] .",
    "the spectrum is paired and is symmetric with respect to one , which is in perfect agreement with the field theory expectation .",
