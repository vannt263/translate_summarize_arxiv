    "samples consisted of a 20-nm thick silicon nitride membrane spanning a 20 @xmath4 m wide square silicon window .",
    "the pattern was cut through the membrane with a dual - beam focused ion beam instrument ( fei , national center for electron microscopy , lawrence berkeley national laboratory ) , using a 500 pa beam of 30 kev @xmath18 ions .",
    "the 20 nm thick silicon nitride membrane has a transmission of 44% at a wavelength of 32 nm , and causes an estimated phase advance of 20@xmath3 relative to propagation through the same length of vacuum , calculated from the known low - fluence optical constants @xcite .",
    "experiments were performed in vacuo as everything in the direct beam contributes to the diffraction pattern .",
    "the samples were placed in a vacuum vessel 70 m from the fel undulator .",
    "the fel pulse was focused to a 30 @xmath4m@xmath1920 @xmath4 m focal spot on the sample with a 2-m focal length ellipsoidal mirror in the beam line .",
    "single pulses were selected with a fast shutter . due to the source coherence , no aperture was needed to select a coherent patch of the beam , nor was a monochromator used to select a narrow wavelength band of the radiation .",
    "a novel x - ray camera was developed to record low - noise diffraction data from the sample in the forward direction ( see figure 1 ) . in this camera",
    ", a graded multilayer plane mirror separates the diffracted beam from the direct beam , and the intense direct beam passes harmlessly through the hole in the centre of the mirror without damaging the detector .",
    "the diffracted light reflects onto a back - illuminated direct - detection ccd chip ( princeton instruments in - vacuum pi - mte ccd ) , containing @xmath20 square pixels of 20 @xmath4 m width .",
    "the resonant x - ray multilayer of the planar mirror consists of layers of si , mo , and @xmath21 , and was fabricated so that the layer period varies from 18 nm to 32 nm across the mirror .",
    "the variation in multilayer period matches the variation in the angle of incidence of rays emanating from the sample and which strike the mirror .",
    "this angle varies from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , as depicted by the contour lines on the mirror in figure 1 .",
    "the gradient was achieved by sputter - depositing the multilayer materials through a mask onto the rotating substrate , so that the time - averaged deposition gave the desired material thickness at each point on the mirror .",
    "the 32-nm reflectivity across the mirror was 45% , as measured at a synchrotron - based reflectometer @xcite",
    ". only x - rays within a bandwidth of 9 nm and which propagate from near the sample interaction point are efficiently reflected .",
    "broadband plasma emission from the sample is filtered out by the resonant mirror .",
    "also , off - axis radiation scattered from beamline components is reflected at less than 1% and hence filtered from the diffraction pattern .",
    "the reflectivity of the coating diminishes smoothly to zero close to the edge of the central hole , due to decoherence of the coating layers caused by the underlying substrate roughness where the hole was cored .",
    "this  soft edge \" reduces scatter from the hole , whose shadow can be seen as a dark circle at the centre of the patterns in figure 2 . the on - axis path length of the reflected beam from the sample to the ccd was 55 mm , and for 32 nm radiation and objects smaller than 20 @xmath4 m , this distance is in the far field , where the diffraction pattern is equal to the fourier transform of the exit wave @xcite .",
    "image reconstruction was carried out with the shrinkwrap algorithm @xcite .",
    "phase retrieval in shrinkwrap is a non - linear optimization problem in a high - dimensional phase space .",
    "the dimensionality is equal to the number of phases to be retrieved : 1.7 million in this case .",
    "the solution is obtained iteratively by sequentially enforcing known constraints in diffraction and image spaces .",
    "we specifically aim for diffraction phases that are such that the waves re - interfering to form the image must all destructively cancel in areas outside the object s boundary ( called its support ) , and that the amplitudes of the discrete fourier transform of the image match the measured diffraction amplitudes ( which must be measured finely enough to include enough empty space beyond the object to constrain the phases ) .",
    "other iterative transform algorithms usually require that the support of the object be known a priori , and the closer the support to the actual object boundary , the better the reconstruction .",
    "shrinkwrap , however , periodically refines the support constraint from the current estimate of the image .",
    "the support constraint is calculated every 70 iterations by selecting pixels with intensity values greater than 0.2 times the maximum image intensity , after first blurring the image with a gaussian kernel .",
    "the blurring kernel is initially set to 3 pixels full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) and is gradually reduced to 0.7 pixels fwhm by iteration 5000 .",
    "the final support is that found four update cycles prior to the point where the normalized image error @xcite exceeds a value of 0.2 .",
    "this stopping criterion is typically reached in 3000 to 4000 iterations . during the iterations",
    "we did not constrain the intensity or phase in the region in the mirror hole , which contains the unrecorded zero spatial frequency , nor did we constrain the object to be real or positive .",
    "we performed many reconstructions , starting each time from random phases .",
    "each reconstructed image varied slightly due to the fact that with photon shot noise there is no true solution that exactly satisfies all constraint sets .",
    "however , each image determined from the final iterate was clearly recognizable as compared with the sem image .",
    "the image estimate , displayed in fig .",
    "3 ( b ) and ( d ) is the average of 250 independent reconstructions .",

    "<S> x - ray free - electron lasers ( x - ray fels ) are expected to permit diffractive imaging at high - resolutions of nanometer- to micrometer - sized objects without the need for crystalline periodicity in the sample @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> thermalisation of the ejected electrons through collisional electron cascades is completed within 10 - 100 femtoseconds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> heat transport , diffusion and radical reactions take place over some picoseconds to milliseconds .    </S>",
    "<S> radiation tolerance in the x - ray beam could be substantially extended , if we could collect diffraction data faster than the relevant damage processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach requires very short and very bright x - ray pulses , such as those expected from short - wavelength free - electron lasers . </S>",
    "<S> however , the large amount of energy deposited into the sample by a focused fel pulse will ultimately turn the sample into a plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the question is when exactly would this happen </S>",
    "<S> ? there are no experiments with x - rays in the relevant time and intensity domains , and our current understanding of photon - material interactions on ultra - short time scales and at high x - ray intensities is , therefore , limited . </S>",

    "<S> the speckles remain well defined out to the edge of the detector , although their visibility diminishes with scattering angle </S>",
    "<S> . this may be due to the fact that at the high diffraction angles at the edge of the ccd detector , the optical path difference between rays diffracting from points in the object transversely separated by 20 @xmath4 m ( the sample window size ) is @xmath11 @xmath12 m . </S>",

    "<S> the increased ccd acceptance gives a resolution length of 43 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the actual image resolution would be worse than the diffraction limit if the retrieved phases were incorrect , in the same way that phase errors in a lens cause image aberrations . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the image resolution by computing the phase - retrieval transfer function ( prtf ) @xcite , shown in figure 4 . </S>",
    "<S> this function represents the confidence for which the diffraction phases have been retrieved and is calculated by comparing the fourier amplitudes of the average of multiple independent reconstructions to the measured diffraction amplitudes . where the phase of a particular fourier component is consistently retrieved the complex values add in phase , </S>",
    "<S> whereas if the phase is random the sum will approach zero . </S>",
    "<S> the prtf is thus equal to unity when the phase is consistently retrieved and zero when the phase is unknown . </S>",
    "<S> we use the convention that the resolution is given by the point where the prtf drops to 1/e ( reference @xcite ) , which for this image occurs at the resolution limit ( 62 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the same experimental geometry deployed on a hard x - ray free electron laser operating at 0.15 nm wavelength would yield a diffraction - limited resolution length of 0.3 nm .        </S>",
    "<S> the `` lensless '' imaging method used here can be extended to atomic resolution , which will require shorter wavelength x - rays and tighter focusing than demonstrated here . </S>",
    "<S> hard x - ray fels are currently being developed that will create pulses which , when focused on the sample , will produce five orders of magnitude higher photon intensities than used here . an understanding of photon - material interactions on ultra - short time scales and at high x - ray intensities is fundamentally important to all experiments with x - ray lasers . </S>",
    "<S> this area of science is virtually unexplored . </S>",
    "<S> the flash free - electron laser in hamburg is the first radiation source to permit experiments near the relevant photon energies and intensities . </S>",
    "<S> our present results validate the concept of single - shot imaging with extremely intense and ultra short soft x - ray pulses that are capable of destroying anything in their path . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting diffraction pattern carries high - resolution structural information about the object , and the resolution of the reconstructed image extends to the diffraction limit . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that significant damage occurs only after the ultrashort 25 fs fel pulse traverses the sample . </S>",
    "<S> these results have implications for studying non - periodic molecular structures in biology , or in any other area of science and technology where structural information with high spatial and temporal resolution is valuable . </S>",
    "<S> they also point to the viability of nanometer- to atomic - resolution imaging of non - periodic and non - crystalline objects @xcite with hard x - ray fels . </S>"
