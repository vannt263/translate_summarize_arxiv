    "the value of studying electronuclear reactions has long been recognized . in such studies",
    "the entire nucleus is accessed via a well - understood interaction .",
    "a new avenue of investigations has been opened up with the completion of the continuous beam , multi - gev electron accelerator at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility , also known as jefferson lab ( jlab ) .",
    "the present paper reports results from the first experiment done at this facility , which is a study of ( e , ep ) reactions in the quasi - elastic region .",
    "this experiment utilized one of the advantages of electron scattering , namely , the transferred energy and momentum can be varied separately , and one of the main features of jlab , namely , the high intensity continuous electron beam of cebaf which makes it possible to do coincidence measurements orders of magnitude more extensive than could be done previously .",
    "the simplest model of a nucleus is one of independent nucleons populating the lowest available shell - model orbits . in a simple picture of @xmath4 scattering within a nucleus , the electron scatters from a single protons which is moving due to its fermi momentum .",
    "the struck proton may then interact with the residual a-1 nucleons before leaving the nucleus .",
    "of course , neither the nucleus nor the scattering process are this simple and the deviations from these simple pictures reveal much about nuclei and their constituents , both real and virtual . the present experiment consisted of measuring proton spectra in coincidence with inelastically scattered electrons with the energy of the electrons chosen such as to be in the `` quasi - elastic '' region , i.e. at energies corresponding to scattering from single off - mass - shell nucleons .",
    "the spectra were taken in an angular region about the `` conjugate '' angle , i.e. the angle for scattering from stationary nucleons , over an angular range sufficient to cover the smearing of the two - body kinematics caused by the fermi momentum of the confined protons .",
    "data were taken over the range 0.64  @xmath5  q@xmath6  3.25  ( gev / c)@xmath3 where q@xmath3 is the square of the four - momentum transferred to the struck proton .",
    "for an electron knocking a proton , @xmath7 , out of a nucleus @xmath8 with energy transfer @xmath9 and ( three ) momentum transfer @xmath10 leaving a scattered proton , @xmath11 , and a residual nucleus , @xmath12 , two important kinematic quantities are the missing energy : @xmath13 and missing momentum : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the kinetic energy of the knocked out proton and recoiling nucleus , respectively .",
    "the spectral functions were extracted from the @xmath17 and @xmath18 spectra and compared to a variety of theoretical calculations .",
    "the total ( e , ep ) yields are obtained by integrating over the spectral functions and the transparencies then determined by comparing these yields with those predicted by plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) calculations . because the pwia does not allow for final - state interactions the ratio of measured to calculated yield should just be the fraction of outgoing protons which do not suffer a final - state interaction and this is what is defined to be the transparency .",
    "determinations of nuclear transparencies using the ( e , ep ) reaction have been reported for a range of targets covering the periodic table , at bates for q@xmath3 = 0.34 ( gev / c)@xmath3  @xcite , at slac for q@xmath3 between 1 and 7 ( gev / c)@xmath3  @xcite , and more recently at jlab between 3 and 8.1 ( gev / c)@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the present work maps out regions not previously covered and is of greater statistical accuracy .",
    "longitudinal - transverse ( l - t ) separations were performed at two values of q@xmath3 from which the first reported extensive separated spectral functions are obtained .",
    "some transparency results from the present experiment have been previously published  @xcite , as have the separated spectral functions for carbon  @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section for elastic electron - proton scattering is given by the well - known rosenbluth formula : @xmath19\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the differential cross section for the scattering of an electron off a unit point charge , @xmath21 is the virtual polarization parameter , @xmath22 , g@xmath23 is the proton electric form factor and g@xmath24 is the proton magnetic form factor in units of the nuclear magneton , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the proton mass .",
    "the l - t separation is performed by measuring the cross section at different values of @xmath27 while keeping q@xmath3 constant , thus permitting the extraction of g@xmath23 and g@xmath24 .    in scattering from a nucleus",
    "the cross section is expressed in terms of four response functions and in the pwia the coincidence ( e , ep ) cross sections can be written : @xmath28 @xmath29w _ { t}(q,\\omega)+\\ ] ] @xmath30^{1/2}w_{lt}(q,\\omega)\\cos(\\phi ) +   \\frac{\\lambda}{2}w_{tt}(q,\\omega)\\cos(2\\phi)].\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the scattering angle and @xmath33 is the azimuthal angle between the scattering plane and the plane containing @xmath10 and @xmath34 .",
    "the physics of interest is contained in the 4 response functions w@xmath35 , w@xmath36 , w@xmath37 and w@xmath38 . both of the interference terms , w@xmath37 and w@xmath38 are proportional to sin@xmath39 , where @xmath39 is the angle between the scattered proton and the transferred momentum @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , when measurements are made along @xmath10 , i.e. in `` parallel kinematics '' , the interference terms are absent .",
    "varying the incident energy makes it possible to vary @xmath32 at constant @xmath40 and @xmath9 and thus disentangle w@xmath35 and w@xmath36 , that is , perform an l - t separation .",
    "although , the position of the spectrometers allowed measurements only in the scattering plane , the interference term w@xmath37 could be investigated by varying the proton angle about the direction of @xmath10 .",
    "measurements were taken by varying both @xmath32 and @xmath39 .",
    "this is the first l - t separation measured for quasi - elastic ( e , ep ) scattering that covers a large range in both a and q@xmath3 .",
    "the experiment was performed in 1995  -  1996 in hall c at jlab and , was the first experiment performed at the laboratory .",
    "data were taken at ( nominal ) electron energies e@xmath41 = ( 0.8n + 0.045 ) gev with n = 1 - 4 representing the number of `` passes '' the electrons made around the accelerating track .",
    "the absolute beam energy was determined at one - pass by two independent methods .",
    "one method is to use the inelastic scattering to an excited state whose energy is accurately known to calibrate the dispersion of a spectrometer and then use the calibrated spectrometer to measure the energy of the scattered electron as a function of nuclear target mass . for these measurements",
    "a carbon target was used and the dispersion determined by measuring the difference in position of the electrons scattered to the ground and the 4.43891 @xmath42 0.00031 mev  @xcite first excited state . a beo target",
    "was then substituted and the energy of the beam , e , determined using the formula :    @xmath43    one can accurately determine @xmath44 because once the dispersion has been accurately measured the only unknown in eq .",
    "[ disp ] is the beam energy @xmath45 .",
    "this procedure was repeated for several values of the spectrometer magnetic field . with both targets",
    "a small correction was made for the energy loss of the electrons in the target .",
    "the other method is to determine the angle of the diffraction minimum for scattering to a state where the position can be accurately calculated .",
    "the minimum for scattering to the @xmath0c first excited state has been determined to be at @xmath46 = 0.129@xmath420.0006 ( gev / c)@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the ( four ) momentum transfer can be written :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the mass of the scattering nucleus and @xmath32 is the electron scattering angle .",
    "an improvement in accuracy in the measurement of @xmath49 is obtained by using the ratio of elastic scattering to inelastic scattering . again , then , the only unknown is the incident electron energy @xmath45 .",
    "the two methods agreed to 1 part in 2000 and the absolute energy determination using these methods is believed to be accurate to 10@xmath50 .",
    "these methods become less feasible as the energy is increased .",
    "the beam energy can also be determined by measuring the energy and angle of the scattered particles in electron - proton elastic scattering . because of the uncertainties in the angle and momentum measurements this method is less accurate than the other two but has the advantage that it can be used over the entire range of incident electron energies .",
    "elastic @xmath4 scattering was used to measure the energy of the three - pass beam with an uncertainty of 1 part in 500 .",
    "beam energy was also determined by measuring the magnetic field needed to bend the beam around the hall c arc .",
    "the energy calibration as well as other aspects of the experiment are discussed more completely elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "beam currents of 10 to 60 @xmath51amps were used .",
    "the currents were monitored by 3 microwave cavities that were installed for this purpose in the hall c beam line@xcite .",
    "the absolute calibration was performed by comparison with an unser cavity , which is a parametric dc current transformer with very stable gain but a drifting offset which was determined as part of our daily calibration procedure .",
    "the overall accuracy in the beam current measurement was @xmath421% .",
    "data were taken with @xmath52 200 mg / cm@xmath3 c , fe and au targets mounted on a steel ladder in an aluminum scattering chamber .",
    "the target thicknesses were determined to about 0.1% .",
    "the @xmath4 elastic scattering data used for calibration were taken using the 4.0  cm cell of the hall c cryogenic target  @xcite . during the early part of the experiment ,",
    "before the cryogenic target was available , some data were taken with a solid ch@xmath54 target but these data were used to check some kinematic offsets only .",
    "the compositions of hydrocarbon targets are subject to change under beam irradiation and therefore all the calibration data were taken with the liquid hydrogen target .",
    "the cryogenic targets are also mounted on a ladder with both ladders contained in the aluminum scattering chamber .",
    "the 123.0  cm diameter scattering chamber has entrance and exit snouts for the beam and several pumping and viewing ports .",
    "the particles that went to the high momentum spectrometer ( hms ) spectrometer exited through a 0.4  mm aluminum window and those to the short orbit spectrometer ( sos ) through a 0.2  mm aluminum window . for both spectrometers",
    "the particles had to pass through about 15  cm of air before entering the spectrometer .",
    "data were taken with the hms and the sos in coincidence .",
    "this experiment served as the commissioning experiment for these spectrometers .",
    "the hms detected the electrons and the sos the protons , except at the highest q@xmath3 where the roles of the spectrometers were reversed .",
    "the hms is a 25@xmath55 vertical bend spectrometer made up of superconducting magnets in a qqqd configuration .",
    "the dipole field is monitored and regulated with an nmr probe and kept constant at the 10@xmath56 level .",
    "the spectrometer rotates on a pair of rails between 12.5@xmath55 and 90@xmath55 with respect to the beam line .",
    "the hms maximum central momentum is 7.3 gev / c and in preparing for the present experiment the spectrometer was tested up to 4.4 gev / c although the highest setting at which data were taken was 2.6 gev / c .",
    "the usable momentum bite is of the spectrometer is @xmath5220% .",
    "a momentum resolution ( @xmath57 ) of @xmath51.4  10@xmath50 , and an in - plane ( out - of - plane ) angular resolution of 0.8  ( 1.0 )  mrad was achieved for the hms . with no collimator in place",
    "the solid angle subtended for a point target is 8.1  msr .",
    "a 6.35  cm thick heavymet ( machinable tungsten alloy,10% cu ni ; density  =  17 g/@xmath58 ) collimator with a flared octagonal aperture limited the solid angle to 6.8  msr .",
    "the higher momentum particles were usually detected in the hms and except at the backward ( electron ) angles these were the electrons .",
    "detailed information about the hms can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the sos consists of 3 ( normal conducting ) magnets in a qd@xmath59 configuration .",
    "the deflection is vertical with the net bend of 18@xmath55 at the central momentum .",
    "the magnetic fields are monitored with hall probes . with its short path length of 11 m",
    "this spectrometer is particularly well suited for detecting short - lived particles though obviously this attribute was not used in the present experiment .",
    "the spectrometer can be moved between 13.1@xmath55 and 168.4@xmath55 with respect to the beam line ( during this experiment the minimum angle was 14.5 @xmath55 ) and can be moved up to 20@xmath55 out of the horizontal plane , though this was not done in this experiment .",
    "the spectrometer maximum central momentum is 1.8 gev / c with a nominal momentum bite of 40% . a momentum resolution ( @xmath57 ) of @xmath5  1.0  10@xmath50 , an inplane ( out - of - plane ) angular resolution of 4.5(0.5 ) msr was achieved for the sos .",
    "the solid angle subtended is @xmath52 9  msr for a point target , although a collimator similar to that used with the hms limited the solid angle to 7.5  msr . as with the hms",
    ", further details about the sos can be found in the spectrometer documentation  @xcite .",
    "the detector stacks in the two spectrometers are virtually identical .",
    "the particles pass through , in order , a set of drift chambers , a pair of hodoscopes , a gas erenkov detector , another pair of hodoscopes and then a lead - glass calorimeter .",
    "the particle velocity is inferred from the time - of - flight between the two pairs of hodoscopes though the spectra proved to be so clean that it was not necessary to use time - of - flight for particle identification .",
    "signals from the hodoscope planes provide the trigger and in the electron arm particle identification can be incorporated into the trigger by requiring a signal from the erenkov counter and/or a sufficiently large pulse from the calorimeter .",
    "coincidences between the triggers selected out the ( e , ep ) events that make up the physics data .    the drift chambers serve to determine the particles position , x ( y ) , and direction , x ( y ) , in the bend ( nonbend ) plane of the spectrometer and it is these quantities that are used to reconstruct the events .",
    "each spectrometer has two chambers and each chamber contains six planes of wires . in each hms chamber one",
    "pair measures x , one pair measures y and the remaining two planes are rotated @xmath4215@xmath55 with respect to the x plane . the purpose of the third pair of planes is to correlate the xy information when more than one particle traverses a chamber during the readout interval . in the sos chambers one pair is in the x plane and the other two pairs of planes are at @xmath4260@xmath55 with respect to the x plane .",
    "position resolution per plane is @xmath5  250  @xmath51 m in the hms chambers and @xmath5  200  @xmath51 m in the sos .",
    "the wire chamber data was used to reconstruct the trajectory of the particles and determine the particles momentum fraction relative to the central momentum , @xmath60p / p .",
    "wire chamber tracking efficiency is an important element in the overall system efficiency and , as such , must be accurately measured .",
    "this was done by using the position information in the hodoscopes to tag particles passing through a small central region of the chambers and then see what fraction of such events was reconstructed from the wire chamber signals . in both spectrometers typical tracking efficiency was greater than 97% which was determined to better than 1% .",
    "the main sources of wire chamber tracking inefficiency are inefficiencies in the chambers themselves ( we require 5 of the 6 planes have good hits ) and inefficiency in the reconstruction algorithm .",
    "the measured inefficiency was the sum of these inefficiencies and no attempt was made to disentangle the two .        because this was the first experiment performed in hall c , considerable effort went into first optimizing the performance of the spectrometers and then optimizing the data analysis so as to achieve the highest possible accuracy .",
    "the magnetic field of the hms quadrupoles was mapped to determine its optical axis and its effective field length versus current , with effective field length defined as the line integral of the field divided by the average field .",
    "however , the hms dipole was not mapped and its magnetic field to current ( b - to - i ) relation was calculated using the tosca program  @xcite . the measured field map of the quadrupole and the tosca generated map of the dipole were used to build an optics model of the spectrometer with the cosy program  @xcite . for a desired magnetic field of the dipole ( i.e. a desired central momentum ) the dipole current was set according to the b - to - i relation predicted by the tosca program , while the cosy model was used to get the starting value of the quadrupole to dipole ratio ( q / d ) .",
    "the q / d ratio was then varied to get the best focus in the spectrometer and these optimized ratios were used to determine the current settings of the quadrupole for a desired central momentum of the spectrometer . from elastic @xmath4 scattering data it was later determined that the b - to - i relation of the dipole predicted by tosca was wrong by about 0.9% .",
    "the dipole currents were adjusted accordingly to correct for this difference .",
    "a similar procedure was followed for the sos except that the quadrupole was not mapped and the optics model was formulated using the cosy program assuming the field of the quadrupole magnet to be an ideal quadrupole .",
    "the sos dipole b - to - i relation was also found to be slightly wrong ( 0.55% ) and suitable corrections were made to the setting procedure .",
    "the basic strategy in determining the momentum and direction of the scattered particles is to use the wire chamber data to determine the position , ( x , y ) , and the angles , ( x,y ) , of the particles at the focal plane which , in turn , specifies the trajectory of the particle through the spectrometer .",
    "this of course requires knowing the fields of the spectrometer , which are represented by a set of matrix elements that relate the position and direction of the particles as they cross the focal plane , to the particle s momentum , angles of emission , and starting position along the beam direction .",
    "the accuracy of the final results then depends on how well the matrix elements simulate the spectrometers and hence a great deal of effort went into optimizing these matrix elements .",
    "the cosy program was used to calculate an initial set of reconstruction matrix elements using the mapped fields for the hms magnets and the sos dipoles and an assumed pure quadrupole field for the sos quadrupole .",
    "the hall c matrix element optimization package cmop  @xcite was used to optimize the reconstruction matrix elements . in this package",
    "the dispersion matrix elements are optimized using momentum scans , i.e. varying the central momentum by varying the magnetic fields . for each spectrometer",
    "these momentum scans were performed for both elastic p(e , e ) and elastic @xmath0c(e , e ) scattering . in order to obtain",
    "the angular matrix elements sieve slits , which are collimators containing accurately positioned holes , were placed in front of each of the spectrometers so that rays of known initial position and direction could be traced .",
    "the angular matrix elements were then fit by the cmop package ( using singular value decomposition method ) to accurately reproduce the known positions of the sieve slit holes .",
    "similarly the target @xmath61 position ( projection of the target length along the beam ) reconstruction was optimized by utilizing the cmop package with data from scans along the beam direction .",
    "these scans were performed by raising and lowering a slanted carbon target and the continuum portion of the carbon spectrum was used .",
    "most of these calibration data were taken at one - pass , 845 mev , with a check for reproducibility made with two - pass , 1645 mev , electrons .      the spectrometer s acceptances were studied with the aid of the simulation code simc , which is an adoption to the jlab hall c spectrometers of the ( e , ep ) simulation code written for slac experiment ne18  @xcite .",
    "this simulation package employs models for each of the spectrometers ( hms and sos ) .",
    "the same models were also used to study the optical properties of the spectrometers .",
    "these models use cosy generated sets of matrices to simulate the transport of charged particles through the magnetic field of the spectrometer to each major aperture of the spectrometer . energy loss and multiple scattering in the intervening material",
    "were also included .",
    "the events that passed through all apertures were then reconstructed back to the target using another set of matrices generated by cosy .",
    "surviving events were assigned a weight based on the pwia cross - section , radiative corrections and coulomb corrections .",
    "the pwia cross - section was calculated using the deforest  @xcite prescription @xmath62 for the off - shell @xmath4 cross - section and an independent particle shell model ( ipsm ) spectral function for the target nucleus involved .",
    "the pwia calculations and the ipsm spectral functions are elaborated in the next two sections .",
    "the radiative corrections in simc were performed according to the mo and tsai  @xcite formulation adapted for the coincidence ( e , ep ) reaction as described in ref .",
    "further , a normalization factor was calculated from the experimental luminosity , phase space volume and the total number of events generated , so that the simulation provided a prediction of the absolute yield .",
    "the reconstructed momentum , scattering angle , out - of - plane angle and target length distributions generated by the model were compared with the distributions obtained from the @xmath4 elastic scattering data as shown in fig .",
    "1 . these results are an indicator of how well the model acceptance simulated the true acceptance of the spectrometer .",
    "this was the status of the model during the experiment , there has been significant improvement in the model since then .",
    "a major issue in electron scattering experiments is radiative corrections .",
    "the incoming and outgoing electrons can interact with the coulomb field of the nucleus involved in the scattering which results in the emission and absorption of virtual photons and emission of real , primarily soft , photons .",
    "formulas for correcting for these radiative losses have been worked out by mo and tsai  @xcite . correcting spectral functions deduced from ( e , ep ) coincidence spectra is considerably more complicated because in this case the radiated momentum as well as the lost energy must be allowed for .",
    "although these are real physical processes they are experiment specific and so most theoretical calculations do not take them into account .",
    "the prescription for doing this for coincidence ( e , ep ) reactions developed by ent et al .",
    "@xcite was used in the present work . using this prescription , radiated spectra",
    "are generated which can be directly compared with the experimentally measured spectra .",
    "this point is discussed further in the section on spectral functions .",
    "protons , being hadrons , will undergo strong interactions in traversing the detector stack and valid coincidences will be lost .",
    "this loss was measured directly using @xmath4 elastic scattering .",
    "each scattered electron must have an accompanying proton and electrons were selected from a small region at the center of the acceptance thus insuring that protons could only be lost through nuclear interactions and other spectrometer inefficiencies .",
    "transmissions of close to 95% were measured for both spectrometers and are believed to be known to 1% .",
    "the absorption is virtually constant over the range of proton energies encountered in this experiment and therefore the small uncertainty in the absorption has little effect on any of the results .",
    "there were two data acquisition deadtimes of possible concern : electronic deadtime and computer deadtime .",
    "electronic deadtime occurs when triggers are not counted because the electronics hardware is busy processing previous triggers .",
    "electronic deadtime is dependent on the width of the logic signals , which for nearly all of the gates was 30 ns .",
    "this deadtime was measured by recording the rates of multiple copies of the trigger with varying widths and then extrapolating to the rate at zero width . for both spectrometers",
    "the electronic deadtime was found to be @xmath5 0.1% .",
    "computer deadtime is a more serious matter .",
    "most of the earlier data were taken in non - buffered mode where the processing time was about 400  @xmath51s .",
    "later data were taken in the buffered mode with processing times of about 75  @xmath51s .",
    "over 80% of the data were taken with deadtimes of @xmath510% but there were a few runs where deadtimes were as great as 60% . even in these extreme cases the loss of event is known to better than 0.5% from the ratio of the number of triggers generated to the number of triggers recorded by the data acquisition .",
    "this method was checked by measuring a large rate run and then varying the fraction of triggers recorded by the data acquisition .",
    "table i shows the kinematics settings where data were taken .",
    "the protons in the nucleus have finite momentum and therefore the struck protons from quasi - elastic scattering will emerge in a cone about the three - momentum transfer @xmath10 and measurements must be taken across this cone .",
    "the lower the magnitude of @xmath10 the broader the cone but , fortunately the cross section increases with decreasing q@xmath3 .",
    "while it is desirable to take data over as large a range of q@xmath3 as possible the cross section falls off so rapidly with increasing q@xmath3 that at the highest q@xmath3 point , 3.25 ( gev / c)@xmath3 , the cross section is so small that data could only be taken on one side of the conjugate angle .",
    "l - t separations were performed at q@xmath3 of 0.64(gev / c)@xmath3 and 1.8(gev / c)@xmath3 . in order to get a good separation ,",
    "data should be taken at as divergent values of @xmath27 ( eq 1 ) as possible , which translates into a large @xmath27 point at small ( electron ) angle and large incident energy and a low @xmath27 point at large angle and small energy ( table i ) .",
    "the cross section decreases rapidly with increasing angle and so it was only possible to cover one side of the proton cone at @xmath27 = 0.31 , q@xmath3 = 1.8(gev / c)@xmath3 and even at q@xmath3 = 0.64(gev / c)@xmath3 there was time for only one point on the low - angle side of the cone .",
    "furthermore , no gold data were taken at the larger angle and higher q@xmath3 ( 1.8 gev / c@xmath3 ) .",

    "requires accurate data , partially because the anomalous proton magnetic moment leads to the response function being primarily transverse which , in turn , means that it is necessary to separate out a longitudinal response from a response function that is dominated by the transverse over the entire range . as noted above , except at the large @xmath27 , small q@xmath3 point it was not possible to cover the entire cone , which would have made it possible to average over the interference terms in the response function . the fact that the differential cross sections are not symmetric about the conjugate angle ( fig .",
    "15 ) demonstrates that these terms are not necessarily negligible . for the l  -  t separations",
    "it was therefore decided to use only data where these terms must be small , namely , requiring that @xmath63 be less than 80 mev / c .",
    "the spectral functions obtained using the pwia are the weighted average of what can be called separated spectral functions , s@xmath35 and s@xmath36 , and can be written : @xmath64 and the l  -  t separation then separates out @xmath65 and @xmath66 with the deforest prescription  @xcite used to modify @xmath67 and @xmath68 from the free nucleon values in order to account for the fact that the nucleons are bound in a nucleus .",
    "the separated spectral functions for carbon have already been reported  @xcite",

    "17 . because of the increasing dominance of the magnetic scattering with increasing q@xmath3 ( eq .",

    "19(20 ) for carbon at q@xmath3 = 0.64(1.8 ) ( gev / c)@xmath3 . at 0.64 ( gev / c)@xmath3",
    "there is little effect on either spectral function and the decrease in transverse strength at the higher q@xmath3 shows little change .",
    "however , the form factors of ref .  @xcite lead",
    "to a 60% increase in the longitudinal strength between the two values of momentum transfer .",
    "it is hard to imagine a mechanism that would lead to such a q@xmath3 dependency and it is clear that the final interpretation of the present ( and a great deal of other ) data must await a resolution of the question of the free proton electric form factor .    the extra transverse strength at low q@xmath3 , which we attribute to multi - nucleon exchange currents and perhaps other multi - nucleon effects , could lead to an overestimation of the transparency because the pwia only deals with single nucleon currents .",
    "therefore , we also show in fig .",
    "16 the transparencies at q@xmath3 = 0.64 ( gev / c)@xmath3 deduced from the longitudinal spectral function alone , and these deduced transparencies are substantially lower than the nominal transparencies .",
    "however , we must note that the same procedure at q@xmath3 = 1.8 ( gev / c)@xmath3 does not have a big effect on the deduced transparency .    the behavior of the transverse spectral function as a function of q@xmath3 is consistent with a recent calculation of the separated cross - sections on @xmath73o  @xcite .",
    "this calculation includes contribution from two - nucleon photo - absorption and predicts a reduction in the transverse strength with increasing q@xmath3 , as observed in this experiment .",
    "however , it also predicts a large effect due to the two - nucleon photo - absorption on the longitudinal strength which is inconsistent with the present results .",
    "it should be pointed out that the effects due to two - nucleon photo - absorption calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite are an upper limit rather than an exact prediction .",
    "taking advantage of the high - quality electron beams and associated detection systems that have become available with jlab coming into operation , ( e , ep ) coincidence measurements were made on carbon , iron and gold targets at momentum transfers q@xmath3 of 0.64 , 1.28 , 1.8 and 3.25(gev / c)@xmath3 .",
    "spectral functions were measured for missing momentum out to 300 ( mev / c ) and missing energy up to 80 mev and these differ in detail , but not in overall shape , from independent particle shell model calculations .",
    "other reported calculations do not give much better fits except perhaps those from a code based on a @xmath74 mean field theory . by comparing the experimental yields integrated over missing energy and missing momentum with pwia calculations",
    "nuclear transparencies for 350 - 1800 mev protons were determined with an accuracy that is considerably greater than previously reported transparency determinations .",
    "longitudinal - transverse separations were performed at 0.64 ( gev / c)@xmath3 and 1.8 ( gev / c)@xmath3 with the iron and gold separations being the first such data on medium and heavy nuclei .",
    "considerable excess transverse strength is found at q@xmath3 = 0.64 ( gev / c)@xmath3 which is much reduced at 1.8 ( gev / c)@xmath3 .",
    "this excess strength is attributed to multi - nucleon effects that have less effect on smaller distance probes .",
    "recently reported determinations of g@xmath23/g@xmath24 for the proton which are in substantial disagreement with previously accepted values will , if they are confirmed , substantially alter the magnitude of the longitudinal spectral function at 1.8 ( gev / c)@xmath3 .",
    "however , because g@xmath24 is primarily determined by the absolute cross section the transverse spectral function will be little affected .",
