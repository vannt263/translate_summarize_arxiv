    "ground - state density - functional theory(dft)@xcite is enjoying more and more popularity for calculating various atomic and molecular properties .",
    "the balance between accuracy and calculation speed in dft is achieved using an auxiliary kohn - sham(ks ) system of non - interacting electrons . if the exact exchange - correlation energy were known as a functional of the density , dft would yield exact ground - state energies .    in principle , all atomic and molecular properties are functionals of the ground - state density , including the properties of excited states@xcite , but in practice only the ground - state energy functional has been usefully approximated .",
    "the excited - state properties of the non - interacting kohn - sham reference system are often used to understand and even approximate those of the true interacting system , but in most cases this has no theoretical justification .",
    "thus the results of excited - state calculations with ground - state dft must be carefully examined , since the ks orbitals and energies are ( within ground - state dft ) artificial constructs designed only to reproduce the ground - state density .",
    "the more we understand about the differences between the ks system and the real system , the better we can determine whether an excited property of the ks system can be justified as an approximation to the real property .",
    "we study the exactness of the ks oscillator strength at the first ionization threshold in this paper .    on the other hand , time - dependent density - functional theory(tddft ) in principle gives several exact properties of excited states@xcite .",
    "linear response tddft is a method that begins from ground - state dft , and couples ground- state ks transitions to give the correct properties of excited states.@xcite if we could use the exact time- dependent functional , the tddft method would exactly generate the properties of the real system from the results of the ground - state ks calculation of systems with non - interacting electrons .",
    "thus our study of the exactness of the ks oscillator strength is converted to a question about the difference betweeen ground - state dft and tddft .",
    "this may seem to be a simple problem , since ground - state dft is not designed to give the correct oscillator strength at the ionization threshold .",
    "the oscillator strengths can be extracted from strength of the poles of the linear response function , and the ks linear response function does not involve the hartree - exchange - correlation(hxc ) kernel(refer to eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : bkgnd : dysonlike ] ) and ( [ eqn : bkgnd : fhxc ] ) ) , so there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect the exact ks system to give the correct oscillator strength at the ionization threshold . by exact",
    "ks we mean the ks potential as extracted from an extremely accurate ground - state density@xcite , thereby avoiding the difficulty of distinguishing the effect of approximate ground - state xc functionals from that of ks - dft itself . however , the ionization threshold of the exact ks system _ is _ equal to the ionization threshold of the real system , since koopmans theorem holds exactly for the exact ks system.@xcite thus this specific excited - state property is given exactly by the ks system , despite the lack of input from the hartree and xc kernels .",
    "this is the only known direct link between real excited - state properties and their ks counterparts , and such links have proven invaluable in studying and understanding both ground - state and tddft@xcite .",
    "given the usefulness of such links , and how both the strength and position of the the threshold occur at the same frequency , it is important to ask the title question , to see if some unknown exact condition might be lurking beneath the surface . to do this , we study one specific case .",
    "if , for he , we find definitively that the threshold oscillator strength is not given by the ks system , the answer is definitely no , and this can not be true in general . if we did find it to match , the title question would remain open , and we would look for other cases and/or a proof of the equality . as we show below",
    ", the answer is indeed no .",
    "this has important consequences for the unknown exact xc kernel of tddft . to shift an ionization threshold ,",
    "the kernel would need to be complex , with a branch cut at the position of the ks threshold .",
    "this is not the case for the first ionization threshold , but is for all higher ionizations .",
    "on the other hand , since we show that , typically , the oscillator strength of the ks system _ is _ corrected by tddft , this means that , at the threshold , the hartree - xc kernel _ must _ have some non - zero off - diagonal matrix elements . to understand this",
    ", @xcite showed that , in the absence of off - diagonal matrix elements , the ks oscillator strengths are unchanged by the action of the kernel .",
    "in this paper we will show the answer to the title question is no . to prove that the ks oscillator strength does nt have to be exact at the ionization threshold , we only need to provide a counter - example , so we study the helium oscillator strength spectrum in this paper .",
    "the helium atom is the simplest multi - electron system , and thus a theorists favorite .",
    "[ fig : thres ] shows the photoabsorption spectrum of helium near the ionization threshold(24.6 ev ) , and the two curves are of the real helium and of the exact ground - state ks helium .",
    "[ fig : thres ] suggests the answer to the title question is no , but there could conceivably be near - degeneracies near the ionization threshold , and we wish to demonstrate that the oscillator strength curve can be expected to be smooth near the ionization threshold explicitly .",
    "hence we use a fit to explicitly show that the oscillator strength curves of the real helium and the ks helium are smooth across the ionization threshold , showing there are no near - degeneracies at the threshold .",
    "this allows the comparison of the value of the oscillator strengths at the ionization threshold of these two systems , showing that the difference between the spectra near the threshold of ks and real systems is inherent . since our purpose is to understand the difference between ks system and the real system , the fit is not done to the data points but to the general properties , such as the oscillator strength sum rules .",
    "we test our fit on the hydrogen oscillator strength spectrum , and then apply the fit to ks helium , real helium , and the result of using approximated tddft on the exact ground - state ks spectrum .",
    "in this section we provide a brief definition of notation and concepts used in this article . for any interacting electronic problem ,",
    "the exact ground - state ks system is described by the ks equations@xcite : @xmath0 here and unless otherwise noted , we use atomic units so that energies are in hartrees and distances in bohr radii .",

    "the exact dependence of the xc contribution on the density is unknown and many approximation schemes are available , but in this article we use the exact value@xcite .",
