    "the source,``afgl  5356 '' , represents the first recognition of anything unusual at _ l_=354.88@xmath3 , _",
    "b_=-0.54@xmath3 in the form of the discovery of mid - infrared ( mir ) emission from a point source in the rafgl rocket sky survey of price & walker ( 1976 ) .",
    "oh354.88 - 0.54 was independently discovered as a strong 1612-mhz maser during a maser survey of the galactic plane , between _ l_=340@xmath3 and the galactic centre , by caswell et al .",
    "the 1612-mhz spectrum showed two well - defined peaks with an expansion velocity of @xmath415kms@xmath1 , typical for asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars with high mass - loss rates . by the early 1980s ,",
    "oh354.88 - 0.54 was recognized to be an extremely heavily obscured star with no detectable optical counterpart .",
    "the next 15 years saw a variety of infrared ( ir ) measurements of the source , culminating in a secure identification of the object as an extreme , large amplitude , long period variable , with several unusual characteristics .    in this paper",
    "we bring together the key multi - wavelength data on oh354.88 - 0.54 .",
    "we introduce the nebular ring (  2 ) , summarize what is currently known about oh354.88 - 0.54 from the perspective of the maser (  3 ) , the ir photometry (  4 ) , and the optical spectrum of the nebula (  5 ) , leading to our conclusions about the nature of the nebula (  6 ) .",
    "to provide a framework within which to locate the elements of oh354.88 - 0.54 described in this paper , we offer the following cross - section of a typical agb star s circumstellar shell ( reid & menten ( 1997 : their figure  12 ) , cohen ( 1989 ) , and chapman & cohen ( 1986 ) ) by radius and temperature .",
    "stellar photosphere : @xmath5  cm , 2400  k ; sio masers : @xmath6  cm , 1250  k ; dust formation zone : @xmath7  cm , 1100  k ; oh 1612-mhz masers : @xmath8  cm , @xmath450  k.    the unexpected optical detection of the h@xmath0 ring nebula clearly associated with the oh / ir star has prompted this work because of what it might tell us about the earliest onset of the fast wind in pn formation .",
    "the overriding issues are to identify the source of ionization for this nebula , to explain its visibility and regular form at a time when the central star is still a long period variable , and hence locate it in the context of late stellar evolution as it proceeds to the pn phase .",
    "the region of the sky where oh354.88 - 0.54 is located shows much complex and diffuse nebular emission . the aao / ukst h@xmath0 survey of the southern milky way ( parker & phillipps 1998 ; parker & phillipps 2003 ) took a survey exposure of field ha630 ( exposure number ha18520 ) on which a distinct , circularly symmetric nebula ( figure  [ ring ] ) was discovered .",
    "this was during a systematic search for galactic planetary nebulae ( pne ) derived from this survey ( parker et al .",
    "version 1.0 of the edinburgh / aao / strasbourg catalogue of galactic planetary nebulae has been released ( parker et al .",
    "2003b ) , and the effort continues as the macquarie - aao - strasbourg h@xmath0 pn project ( hereafter referred to as the  mash \" ) .",
    "the object appears projected against the edge of the highly opaque dark cloud g354.9 - 00.6 ( hartley et al .",
    "1986 ) , measuring about @xmath9 .",
    "the size of the nebula was measured by overlaying circles with a wide variety of centres and radii from which both the circularity and 39@xmath101@xmath11 diameter were determined . as part of the standard procedure for comparing detections of new pn candidates with possible alternative identifications ,",
    "it was noted that the position of the centroid of the ring ( 17@xmath12 35@xmath13 02.62@xmath14@xmath100.16@xmath14 , @xmath1533@xmath3",
    "33@xmath16 27.92@xmath11@xmath101.90@xmath11 , j2000 ) very closely matched the position of a known strong oh maser source , oh354.88 - 0.54 .",
    "( the positional uncertainties arise from the difficulty in defining the outer edges of the faint ring . )",
    "details of the nebula are given in table  [ bdata ] , including data presented later in this paper .",
    ".details of the planetary nebula around oh354.88 - 0.54 [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]",
    "during the programme of spectroscopic follow - up of mash pne candidates on the saao 1.9 m telescope a long - slit ( 2@xmath16 ) spectrum of the newly identified h@xmath0 ring ( within which the maser source is centred ) was taken on 2003 june 28 ( jd2452819 , phase 0.30 ) .",
    "the instrumental configuration was similar to that described by parker & morgan ( 2003 ) with the use of a high dispersion 1200r grating giving @xmath17  pixel@xmath1 over the range 6152 - 6912 .",
    "wavelength calibration was via copper - argon arc lamp exposures taken on either side of the 1200s exposure on the h@xmath0 ring .",
    "the location of the slit is indicated in figure  [ ring ] .",
    "a nebular detection was obtained confirming the veracity of the optical shell .",
    "the nebula spectrum was flux calibrated using the spectrophotometric standard star ltt6248 taken 15  min prior to the target exposure . the spectrum is given in figure  [ nebspec ] , which shows h@xmath0/[nii ] and [ sii ] emission lines together with evidence of a faint red continuum .",
    "the abruptly rising red continuum we attribute to contamination by a faint red star within the slit .",
    "consequently , we regard the spectrum as that of a planetary nebula , because it is circularly symmetric , centred on an evolved exciting star of intermediate mass , still a red agb star , and exhibits the canonical emisson lines associated with such nebulae .",
    "the weighted average of the heliocentric radial velocities of these five lines is @xmath18  km  s@xmath1 , equivalent to an lsr velocity of @xmath19  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the ratio of the sulphur lines , i(6717)/i(6731 ) , is 0.59 . adopting t@xmath20=10@xmath21  k , and using table 5.7 of osterbrock ( 1989 ) yields n@xmath20@xmath44000  @xmath22 .",
    "one can estimate the ionized gas mass ( m@xmath23 ) in the pn from the correlation for galactic disk pne between m@xmath23 and absolute size derived by boffi & stanghellini ( 1994 : their eqn.(9 ) ) .",
    "we find m@xmath23  =  0.35  m@xmath24 .",
    "using the expression for m@xmath23 in a pn given by boffi & stanghellini ( 1994 ) in their eqn.(5 ) , treating the pn as a sphere of radius @xmath410@xmath25  cm ( @xmath420@xmath11 at 3.2  kpc ) , with n@xmath20 determined from the red [ sii ] lines , the deduced filling factor is 0.02 .",
    "thus this pn is characterized by a somewhat larger than average ionized mass and a smaller than average filling factor .",
    "we have identified a faint , circular nebula with a typical pn spectrum , centred on an extremely red , long - period variable star associated with a bright oh 1612-mhz maser .",
    "the pn spectrum is proof of the reality and nature of the h@xmath0 nebula , and the good centring of the oh maser suggests a causal link between the long period variable and the nebula .",
    "the h@xmath0 survey image covered the position of the oh / ir star on jd2451338 ( 1999 august 6 ) at a light curve phase of the star s ir variation of 0.34 , almost the same as the phase at which the optical spectrum was obtained ( 0.30 ) .",
    "the optical spectrum of the nebula samples the expanding gas only near the tangent to the ring , giving us rather limited information on the outflow velocity of the gas far from the star .",
    "the formal difference between the star s systemic velocity and that of the nebular emission lines is @xmath420  km  s@xmath1 , but this must be a lower bound on the true outflow speed because of our viewing geometry at the edge of the ring .",
    "could it be fast enough to collisionally ionize the ambient gas ?",
    "the spectrum reveals no hint of [ oi ] 6300/6363  emission lines , but our wavelength region did not cover [ oii ] 7320/7330  nor hei 5876 , lines that could signify gas cooling after a shock at a velocity between a few tens and @xmath4100 km  s@xmath1 . at much lower velocities ,",
    "the resulting fractional ionization of h would be too low for us to detect .",
    "if the nebular emission were due solely to shock interaction with the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) , one would not expect a uniformly bright nebula because the interaction would produce emission line cooling strongly dependent on local density inhomogeneities encountered in the ism .",
    "we plan to reobserve this nebula with a larger telescope , to widen our wavelength coverage , and to secure new nebular spectra at several light curve phases .",
    "the central star appears to come from a progenitor of intermediate mass ( @xmath26  m@xmath24 ) .",
    "it is still pulsating strongly , and moving along a suggested evolutionary track characteristic of miras and oh / ir stars .",
    "if oh354.88 - 0.54 were truly an li source , sevenster has argued that such objects are more likely to become bipolar pne",
    ". the high signal - to - noise oh spectral profile we present shows no hint of bipolarity as yet , based upon the oh profiles predicted by zijlstra et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that signal the onset of bipolarity in early post - agb stars .",
    "the oh envelope around this star is elongated in an e - w direction but sparser in maser emission at its poles ( n - s ) , like an edge - on torus .",
    "mir stellar emission is elongated orthogonal to the oh maser emission , suggesting that any outflowing gas in which dust grains have condensed is dominantly in the polar directions .",
    "therefore , the mir emission is likely to represent a more recent phenomenon than the accumulated toroid of oh gas .",
    "might this signify the earliest onset of the fast wind ( kwok , purton & fitzgerald 1978 ) in this source ?",
    "the existence of the ionized nebula poses the question of what mechanism for ionization such an agb star has available to it .",
    "the oh spectral profile indicates no evidence for a hot binary companion , precluding direct radiative ionization of the circumstellar gas .",
    "oh envelopes around long period variables are known to be sparsely populated and dominated by a relatively small number of clumps ( welty et al .",
    "1987 ; van langevelde et al .",
    "1990 ) . therefore ,",
    "conceptually , a fast wind might penetrate through the toroid containing the oh molecules and far into the circumstellar region , producing collisional ionization of the accumulated material previously shed by the star during its agb evolution .",
    "one other scenario is worth considering as a possible source of nebular ionization .",
    "if the central agb star were a  born - again \" ( e.g. , iben 1984 ) object that had undergone a `` very late thermal pulse '' (  vltp \" ; e.g. , blcker & schnberner 1997 ) as it entered the cooling track , then material would have been shed and ionized by the hot central star as it created a pn at the end of its former agb life . given sufficient remaining core helium , this late helium flash would have returned the central star to the agb within a very short period of time ( a few hundred years in a star initially of roughly solar mass and abundances ( lawlor & macdonald ( 2003 ) , their table  2 ) ) .",
    "perhaps the currently oh - masing , long - period ir variable never had to ionize the nebulous ring .",
    "empirical estimates for the luminosity of the star range from 1.7@xmath2710@xmath21 ( le sidaner & le bertre 1996 ) to 3.1@xmath2710@xmath21  l@xmath24 ( table 2 , this paper ) , implying a bolometric magnitude between -5.85 and -6.50 , respectively .",
    "vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) have modeled the evolution of agb stars . from their table 2",
    "one derives a minimum initial mass for the progenitor of oh354.88 - 0.54 of 4 - 5  @xmath28 and an expected core mass of @xmath40.8 - 0.9  @xmath28 .",
    "this initial mass is higher than those of the roughly solar - mass stars undergoing vltps discussed by lawlor & macdonald ( 2003 ) , and vassiliadis & wood ( 1994 ) did not incorporate vltps into their work on the evolution of intermediate mass stars .",
    "if a 4 - 5  @xmath28 progenitor could undergo the vltp phenomenon , is it likely that the pn ejected after the first agb phase of evolution would have remained ionized while the star rejoined the agb ?",
    "the recombination time scale for the pn around oh354.88 - 0.54 , with t@xmath20=10@xmath21 , would be @xmath2910@xmath30/n@xmath20 yr ( e.g. marten & szczerba 1997 ) , or 25  yr",
    ". it would be remarkable if such a progenitor could accomplish its post - vltp evolution and return to the agb within only a few years .",
    "it is also noteworthy that this star has shown no hint of the rapid changes of behaviour so characteristic of other possible vltp sources such as v605 aql and fg sge .",
    "therefore , we speculate that we may be witnessing a hitherto unobserved phase of pn evolution , in which a pn has only recently started to appear around a star that is unequivocally still in its agb phase .",
    "mc thanks nasa for supporting this work under its long term space astrophysics and astrophysics data analysis programmes , through grants nag5 - 7936 and nng04gd43 g with uc berkeley .",
    "the aao has undertaken the h@xmath0 survey on behalf of the astronomical community .",
    "we thank jim caswell for his ever reliable and well - documented dossier on the early oh survey ; nicolas epchtein and terry jones for helping us to understand the discordant nir measurements from february 1981 ; rachel deacon for providing us with a table of the _ iras _ and msx flux densities for her samples of maser sources ; and falk herwig for valuable discussions about the vltp phenomenon in agb stars .",
