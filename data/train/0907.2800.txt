    "the existence of two diffeomorphism classes in the case ( @xmath424 , @xmath425 , @xmath503 ) gives the following interesting examples of embeddings : starting from an @xmath488 of this type , representing a generator of @xmath449 by an embedded @xmath235-sphere and doing surgery on this sphere , we obtain a manifold @xmath504 with @xmath441 , @xmath505 , @xmath506 .",
