    "it is obvious that the amplitudes for the reflection and transmission for the different illumination directions are identical since there are no losses .",
    "the phase in transmission is equally identical due to reciprocity . on the contrary ,",
    "the phase in reflection is not .",

    ", a unit cell must provide a @xmath0 phase change prior being applicable in a reflectarray @xcite .",
    "this @xmath0 phase change shall be obtained by a suitable geometrical tuning .",
    "moreover , it has to maintain a high reflection amplitude across the considered geometrical configuration .",

    "( b ) the same plot as in ( a ) for variation of air hole height .",
    "@xmath51 is fixed to @xmath70  nm . , scaledwidth=49.0% ]    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : figphas](a ) , the proposed nanoparticle satisfies the required condition for the phase variation of the reflection coefficient for both illumination directions when we fix the height @xmath71 nm and change the diameter @xmath72 nm .",
    "the amplitude of the reflection coefficient is close to unity within an acceptable range while it drops down to one half at both ends of the diameter variations .",
    "the situation is a bit worse for the case when we fix the diameter @xmath73 nm and vary the height @xmath74 nm . in this case , we obtain a phase variation of @xmath0 only for the forward illumination direction while the amplitude of the reflection coefficient , in some parameter regions , drops down to @xmath75 [ see fig .  [ fig : figphas](b ) ] . we should mention that better results might be obtained if the geometry is carefully optimized .",
    "the presented example only serves the purpose to demonstrate the idea .",
    "another important point is that the proposed nanoparticles in the array , provides asymmetric phase variations .",
    "that is , the variation of reflection phases are different for different illumination directions .",
    "it means that we may properly design a reflectarray with two different properties when looking from different directions onto the plane .",
    "this is impossible using symmetrical structures which do not provide bianisotropic properties .",
    "the most important point about the proposed reflectarray is its transparency out of the resonance band . indeed , in the investigated reflectarray",
    ", we do not rely on a metallic back reflector @xcite .",
    "instead , we have offered resonant nanoparticles with bianisotropic properties to obtain a full reflection .",
    "this gives us the possibility to preserve transparency outside the resonance band in the reflectarray .",
    "this transparency is very important when combining multiple receiving / transmitting systems .",
    "then , we need a reflectarray at a frequency band while we do not want to prevent signals to get transmitted out of that frequency band .",
    "we have proposed a novel design for high - index dielectric nanoparticle which supports an omega - type bianisotropic coupling in addition to magnetic and electric optically - induced dipole resonances .",
    "we have demonstrated that the magneto - electric coupling can be tuned by geometric parameters of the nanoparticle . in particular",
    ", the nanoparticle can possess different backward cross sections and consequently different optical scattering forces , when being illuminated by a plane wave from opposite directions along with the identical forward cross sections .",
    "for a metasurface created by a periodic array of bianisotropic nanoparticles , we have observed interesting effects , e.g. asymmetric reflection phases for the opposite illumination directions , and a possibility to achieve a @xmath0 phase change together with an acceptable reflection amplitude across the entire phase spectrum by tuning the geometric parameters of the nanoparticle .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated that the employment of the proposed resonant nanoparticle together with the absence of a fully reflective metallic screen gives the opportunity of _ out - of - band transparency _ in reflectarrays .",
    "all the effects described here are the direct outcome of the engineered omega - type bianisotropy that may open a new direction to design high - index nanoparticles and metasurfaces , including reflectarrays , transmitarrays , and huygens metasurfaces .",
