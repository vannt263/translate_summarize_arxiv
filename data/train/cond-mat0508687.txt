    "the dynamics of a bosonic fluid rotating within a thin torus and , particularly , the study of the properties relevant to its weakly - excited states have received recently a large attention @xcite-@xcite due to the rich phenomenology that characterizes such a system . for example , the quantization of fluid circulation is shown @xcite to disappear whenever the physical parameters cause the hybridization of condensate ground state over different angular momentum ( am ) states .",
    "a similar effect is found in the mean - field dynamics of the condensate wavefunction on a circle @xcite , where the circulation loses its quantized character when the system is in the soliton regime .",
    "the rotating fluid exhibits low - energy am quantum states ( corresponding to the presence of plateaus of quantized circulation ) that determine the hybridization effect by a suitable tuning of the model interaction parameters @xcite . in the simplest possible case ,",
    "the model exhibits two momentum ( bosonic ) modes associated to two am states ( the ground - state and the first excited state ) of the fluid .",
    "an almost identical model @xcite-@xcite has been studied thoroughly in the recent years within bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) physics , where a condensate is distributed in two potential wells that exchange bosons via tunneling effect .",
    "the two - well model @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are bosonic space - modes and @xmath3 , displays hybridized states when the well - depth imbalance vanishes ( @xmath4 ) .    for both models",
    "the energy regime of interest is that corresponding to the ground - state or to weakly excited states . in this respect , many authors have tried to develop approximation schemes able to provide a satisfactory analytical description of the low energy spectrum and of its states .",
    "the nonlinear character of the model hamiltonian entails a difficult diagonalization process unless one resorts to numerical calculations . in this case the exact form of the spectrum is obtained quite easily .",
    "however , for n - well systems such as condensate arrays described by the bose - hubbard model , josephson - junction arrays and , in general , n - mode bosonic systems @xcite , @xcite , the exact diagonalization requires a computational effort rapidly increasing with n. this motivates the interest in developing effective , analytical approximation methods able to solve the diagonalization problem .",
    "the present work has been inspired by papers @xcite and @xcite where , among the variuos issues considered , the structure of the ground state of a ring condensate ( within a two - am - mode approximation of the bosonic quantum field ) has been studied . as to the closely related two - well boson model",
    ", the same problem has been investigated in @xcite within the hermitian phase operator method . in order to obtain a satisfactory description of the system ground state as well as of the weakly - excited states for the two - mode model , we implement , in the present paper , an algebraic approach based on the _ inn - wigner contraction _",
    "method @xcite .",
    "this method allows one to simplify the algebraic structure of the hamiltonian reducing the latter in a form apt to perform a completely analytic derivation of its spectrum . a well defined limiting procedure",
    ", mapping the original hamiltonian generating algebra to a simpler algebra , often succeeds in reducing the nonlinear terms to a tractable form .",
    "these terms , originated by the boson - boson interaction and thus occurring in any model inherent in bec dynamics , are known to make the hamiltonian diagonalization a hard task .",
    "such a technique and the effect of simplifying the algebraic structure of model hamiltonians , has found a wide application in many fields of theoretical physics .",
    "it is well illustrated , e. g. , in reference @xcite where it is applied to study collective phenomena in nuclear models .    the contraction - method approach ( cma ) namely the contraction procedure and the ensuing approximation of weakly excited states works well for the spectrum sectors where the energy levels are close to the minima and the maxima of the classical hamiltonian and thus seems suitable for studying the low - energy regime of two - mode nonlinear models .",
    "the results obtained within the cma in sections [ sez2 ] and [ sez3 ] will be compared both with the exact spectrum calculated numerically and with an alternative approch based on the coherent - state semiclassical appproximation ( cssa ) reviewed in section [ sez4 ] .",
    "we consider @xmath5 interacting bosons with mass @xmath6 whose boson - boson interaction can be either attractive or repulsive .",
    "these are confined in a narrow annulus whose thickness @xmath7 is much smaller than the annulus radius @xmath8 .",
    "bosons are also acted by an external potential which causes inter - mode tunneling . particularly ,",
    "the rotating fluid with attractive interaction can be shown to be equivalent to the two - well model of repulsive bosons introduced previously . in the coordinate frame of the potential rotating with angular velocity @xmath9 and with @xmath10 axis parallel to total angular momentum @xmath11",
    ", the bosonic - field hamiltonian reads @xmath12 { \\hat\\psi}_{\\bf r } + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int \\ ! \\ !",
    "\\int d^3 { \\bf r } \\ , d^3 { \\bf s } \\ ,   { \\hat\\psi}^+_{\\bf r } \\ , { \\hat\\psi}^+_{\\bf s }   u ( |{\\bf r}- { \\bf s}| ) { \\hat\\psi}_{\\bf s } \\ , { \\hat\\psi}_{\\bf r } % \\label{ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the destruction ( creation ) boson field operator at @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the confining potential . at low temperature ,",
    "the interaction between dilute bosons is well represented by the fermi contact interaction which entails the standard approximation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the @xmath19wave scattering length @xcite .",
    "the two - mode approximation involves only the first two states of am , with eigenvalue equations @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "field operator @xmath22 in the two - mode basis of @xmath23 is thus written as @xmath24 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are bosonic operators and the validity of the two - mode approximation requires the condition @xmath25 ( greater angular velocities would involve other angular - momentum states ) .",
    "within such an approximation  @xcite and considering a thin torus ( @xmath26 ) @xmath27 reduces to @xcite @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , while @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are the critical angular frequency , the mean interaction energy per particle , and the asymmetry of potential @xmath34 , respectively . in the schwinger picture @xcite of algebra su(2 ) @xmath35 further simplifies becoming , up to a constant term , @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "such generators satisfy the commutators @xmath42= i \\epsilon_{rsv } j_v$ ] ( @xmath43 is the antisymmetric symbol ) and commute with the total boson number operator @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) whose eigenvalue @xmath5 is connected with the su(2)-representation index @xmath46 by @xmath47 . in such a scheme , the am states are defined by @xmath48 where the @xmath49-basis states satisfy the eigenvalue equations @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , the index @xmath46 being the eigenvalue of @xmath52 .",
    "the positive ( negative ) sign of @xmath53 in model [ hmod ] implies that the effective interaction between bosons is repulsive ( attractive ) .",
    "the conditions of weak asymmetry and interaction ensuring the validity of the model @xcite are given by @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "the simple spin form of hamiltonian [ hmod ] evidences how the attractive model ( @xmath56 ) coincides with a ( repulsive ) two - site bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite modeling two potential wells of different depth that share @xmath57 bosons and exchange them via tunnel effect .",

    "it worth noting that the study the algebraic structure characterizing the second - quantized hamiltonian for a condensate trapped in two potential wells has received a large attention in the literature . in the seminal work @xcite and in reference",
    "@xcite , in particular , such hamiltonian has been shown to reduce , within a standard mean - field approach , to the sum of mode hamiltonians describing the momentum conservation in the presence of inter - well boson exchange due to the tunneling .",
    "each mode hamiltonian is written in terms of operators @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( @xmath64 are the momentum modes ) and can be reformulated as a linear combination of su(1,1 ) generators . in model [ hmod ] the momentum conservation is explicitly violated since one of the mode takes into account the fluid rotation .",
    "this fact entails that the previuos schwinger realization of algebra su(2 ) , rather than the algebra su(1,1 ) connected with the momentum conservation , characterizes the system .    in our analysis",
    "the dimensionless mean - value per boson of the angular momentum @xmath65 ( where the notation @xmath66 has been introduced ) represents an important quantity .",
    "the angular momentum , in fact , expressed as @xmath67 relates the macroscopic behavior of the rotating condensate to the minimum - energy state properties through the ground - state components @xmath68 . in the sequel we consider the spectral properties of model [ hmod ] both in the attractive case ( @xmath56 ) @xmath69 and in the repulsive case ( @xmath70 )",
    "@xmath71 it is worth noting that the study the ground - state properties of the repulsive case is closely related to the study the maximum - energy state for the attractive hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , after the substitutions @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the repulsive hamiltonian is identical to the attractive one up to a factor @xmath74 . since these two changes can be effected in a unitary way by means of transformations @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , respectively , the spectra of @xmath77 and @xmath78 turn out to satisfy the equation @xmath79 $ ] @xmath80 $ ] . concerning the parameter @xmath81 of hamiltonian [ hmod ]",
    ", we note that the constraint @xmath82 , implies the inequality @xmath83 .",
    "the definition of the further parameters @xmath84 , @xmath85 , allows one to better characterize the regimes of the rotational dynamics as well as the conditions of validity of the present model .",
    "parameter @xmath86 ( representing the ratio of the self - interaction energy per particle to the single - particle energy - level spacing ) should satisfy the inequalities @xmath87 , @xmath88 , owing to the conditions @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively . both these conditions can be satisfied if @xmath91 is not excessively large @xcite",
    ". moreover , parameter @xmath92 allows one to distinguish , in both the attractive and repulsive case , three regimes :    * fock regime , where @xmath93 entails @xmath94 , * josephson regime , where @xmath95 entails @xmath96 , * rabi regime , where @xmath97 entails @xmath98 .",
    "we note that the condition of weak asymmetry @xmath99 given by @xmath100 appears to be compatible with the first two regimes and with part of the rabi regime .",
    "we introduce a simple algebraic approach for studying the low - energy spectrum of hamiltonians [ hatt ] and [ hrep ] for large @xmath46 whose essence consists in simplifying the nonlinearity due to the term @xmath101 .",
    "the inn - wigner contraction @xcite supplies a method for mapping some given algebraic structure in a new one , as the result of a singular limiting process .",
    "the contraction is realized by defining a set of new operators @xmath102 as linear combinations @xmath103 of the generators @xmath104 of a given algebra ( identified by its commutators @xmath105= \\varepsilon_{rsk } g_k$ ] ) and of the identity operator @xmath106 .",

    "the contraction of the algebra mapping is driven by @xmath112 ( with @xmath113 ) and generates , in this limit , the harmonic oscillator ( namely the heseinberg - weyl ) algebra @xcite .",
    "the classical study of attractive ( @xmath56 ) hamiltonian @xmath114 developed in [ appb ] demonstrates ( see formula [ min1 ] ) how @xmath115 , @xmath116 , at low energies .",
