    "the purpose of the e246 experiment is to measure the transverse component of the muon polarization in the decay @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , while we were also able to extract @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) decay as a by - product .",
    "the transverse muon polarization is a t - odd observable defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is used for @xmath1 and @xmath6 for @xmath3 , respectively .    in the framework of the phenomenological consideration",
    ", the transverse muon polarization can be related to the @xmath1 and @xmath3 form factors .",
    "for @xmath1 the t - violating polarization is proportional to the imaginary part of the ratio of @xmath1 form factors : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are defined through @xmath11   \\cdot \\left[\\bar{u}_\\mu\\gamma_\\lambda(1-\\gamma_5)u_\\nu\\right]\\ ] ] the standard model predicts a vanishing value of less than @xmath12 for @xmath13 in @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the calculations of @xmath13 due to the electromagnetic final state interactions result in a value of less than @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "there are several non - standard models predicting sizeable value for @xmath13 : multi - higgs models , susy with squarks mixing , susy with r - parity violation , leptoquark models @xcite .",
    "the values predicted in these models vary from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .    in case of @xmath3",
    "the transverse polarization is related to the decay form factors in a more complicated way : @xmath17\\mbox{im}(\\delta_p)$ ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 $ ] are the functions of @xmath3 kinematic parameters ( shown in fig .",

    "although the standard model prediction for @xmath13 in @xmath3 is as small as for @xmath1  @xcite , the contribution of the final state interaction to this value is @xmath24  @xcite , i.e. considerably larger than in the case of @xmath25 decay .",
    "the predictions for non - zero @xmath13 for @xmath3 come from the same non - standard models mentioned for @xmath1 and also from left - right symmetric models  @xcite .",
    "the expected values vary from @xmath26 to @xmath16 .",
    "the noteworthy peculiarity of these predictions obtained in different models is the correlations between the expected values of @xmath13 for @xmath1 and @xmath3  @xcite : in the three higgs doublet model the @xmath13 expectations are related as @xmath27 ; in susy with squarks mixing the relation for @xmath13 induced by higgs exchange : @xmath28 , while for @xmath13 arising from w - boson exchange : @xmath29 , @xmath30 ; in susy with r - parity violation the relation is @xmath31 ; in left - right symmetric models we have : @xmath32 , @xmath30 .",
    "the previous experimental results for @xmath1 came from the bnl experiment which used kaon decays in flight  @xcite : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , as well as from e246  @xcite : the result obtained for the data collected during 1996 - 1997 period was @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "both results indicated no t - violation in @xmath1 . for @xmath3",
    "there has been no @xmath13 measurement , so our result is the first one .",
    "the e246 apparatus is shown in fig .  [ fig : e246setup ] ,        and described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . kaons with @xmath37 mev / c",
    "are identified by a @xmath38erenkov counter , slowed in an al+beo degrader and then stopped in a target array of 256 scintillating fibers located at the center of a 12-sector superconducting toroidal spectrometer .",
    "charged particles from kaon decays in the target were tracked by means of multi - wire proportional chambers at the entrance ( c2 ) and exit ( c3 and c4 ) of each magnet sector , along with the target and a scintillation ring hodoscope around the target .",
    "the momentum resolution of @xmath39 mev / c at p=205 mev / c was obtained using mono - energetic products from the two - body decay @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) . the energies and angles of the photons from @xmath42 decays",
    "were measured by a csi(tl ) photon detector consisting of 768 modules .",
    "the photon detector covers a solid angle of 3@xmath43 steradian , with openings for the beam entry and exit and 12 holes for charged particles to pass into the magnet gaps . to suppress accidental background from the beam , timing information from each crystal",
    "was used . a good time resolution of 3.5 nsec ( rms ) at 100 mev was achieved .",
    "energy resolution of @xmath44% at 200 mev , angular resolutions of @xmath45 and the invariant mass resolution of @xmath46 mev / c@xmath47 were obtained .",
    "muons entering the polarimeter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : e246setup]c ) were degraded by an al+cu block and stopped in a stack of pure al plates .",
    "positrons from @xmath48 decays of stopped muons were detected by positron counters which were located azimuthally between the muon stoppers .",
    "the trigger included the signals from @xmath38erenkov , target , tof and positron counters along with the requirement of at least one hit in csi(tl ) calorimeter .    the t - violating asymmetry was extracted using a double ratio as : @xmath49 \\label{atdr}\\ ] ] here , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the sums over all 12 sectors of counts of clockwise ( @xmath52 ) and counter - clockwise ( @xmath53 ) emitted positrons and @xmath54/@xmath55 denote events with the photon ( or @xmath42 ) going forward / backward with respect to beam direction .",
    "the sign of @xmath56 for @xmath54 events is opposite to that of @xmath55 events that allows us to employ a double ratio method which reduces most systematic errors and enhances the effect . moreover , considerable reduction of systematic effects was achieved due to the azimuthal symmetry of the 12-sector detector .",
    "the value of @xmath57 is related to @xmath58 by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the analyzing power of the polarimeter , @xmath61 is an angular attenuation factor and @xmath62 is the overall fraction of backgrounds .",
    "the extraction and analysis of @xmath1 and @xmath3 events comprised several procedures common for both decays .",
    "the common stage included target analysis , charged particle tracking and tof analysis and the analysis of muon decay in polarimeter .",
    "active target analysis included target energy deposition and target timing cuts to get rid of kaon decays in flight .",
    "the momentum of charged particle reconstructed by four - point tracking procedure was used to suppress @xmath63 and @xmath41 decays by selecting events with @xmath64 mev / c .",
    "the cut on @xmath65 for the charged particle track was used to suppress @xmath41 decays with @xmath66 decay in flight .",
    "to separate muons and positrons ( thereby suppressing @xmath67 ) we used time - of - flight  ( tof ) technique to calculate charged particle mass and then , on the scatter plot of the tof energy deposition versus tof - reconstructed mass square , we separated the muon cloud from the positron one .",
    "finally , the common stage included the signal extraction from the positron time spectra in the polarimeter .",
    "the second stage of event selection was specific for each decay mode .",
    "for @xmath1 we selected one - photon events with @xmath68 mev and two - photon events which satisfy the constraints on the invariant mass of the two photons and on the missing mass ( reconstructed mass of missing neutrino ) : @xmath69 mev / c@xmath47 and @xmath70 mev@xmath47/c@xmath71 .",
    "additionally , we used the cuts on the opening angles between two photons and between muon and @xmath42 : @xmath72 and @xmath73 to suppress kaon decays in flight and @xmath41 .    the second stage for @xmath3 selected one - photon events with @xmath74 mev and",
    "comprised three major cuts : a constraint on the neutrino missing mass @xmath75 mev@xmath47/c@xmath71 , a cut on the neutrino momentum @xmath76 mev / c and a cut on the opening angle between muon and photon @xmath77 .",
    "these cuts suppressed the @xmath1 by a factor of 70 , while sustaining a @xmath3 loss by a factor of 2 .",

    "the background fractions for extracted @xmath1 and @xmath3 events were estimated using experimental spectra along with the mc simulation data . for @xmath1",
    "the major background contributions come from csi(tl ) accidental hits , @xmath67 and @xmath41 .",
    "all these backgrounds do not induce spurious asymmetry and only dilute the sensitivity to @xmath13 .",
    "the total background fraction for @xmath1 was estimated to be @xmath82% .    in the case of @xmath3",
    "the situation is much worse due to the predominant background of @xmath1 events with one photon escaping csi(tl ) detector .",
    "such events almost completely mimic @xmath3 kinematics , so they can not be suppressed without a considerable loss of useful @xmath3 events .",
    "the optimized @xmath3 cuts reduced the background fraction from @xmath1 to about 17% .",
    "the background @xmath1 events might have non - zero @xmath13 thereby inducing spurious transverse asymmetry .",
    "fortunately , we measure @xmath13 in @xmath1 with higher sensitivity in the same experiment and can reliably estimate this effect .",
    "therefore , we can safely assume no spurious contribution to @xmath13 from @xmath1 background .",
    "the second major source of background is accidental photons in the csi(tl ) detector .",
    "it was suppressed to the level of @xmath83% by requiring a photon energy threshold of 50 mev and a coincidence between a signal from charged particle and a photon signal in the csi within a window @xmath84 ns .",
    "other background modes are suppressed by the @xmath3-specific cuts to a negligible level .",
    "the total background fraction for @xmath3 sample was estimated to be @xmath85% .    the valuable part of the asymmetry analysis includes the extraction of the value of the normal asymmetry @xmath86 which is proportional to the t - even muon polarization , i.e. the in - plane component of the muon polarization normal to the muon momentum .",
    "it can be measured by selecting events with @xmath42 ( or photon for @xmath3 ) moving into the left or right hemisphere with respect to the median plane of the given magnet sector .",
    "the theoretical calculations indicate that the normal polarizations for @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath3  @xcite have opposite signs for the kinematic region where selected events are located , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pn ] .",
    "( left ) and @xmath3 ( right ) .",
    "the dots represent the @xmath3 experimental data.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   ( left ) and @xmath3 ( right ) .",
    "the dots represent the @xmath3 experimental data.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    for one - photon @xmath1 events , we obtained @xmath87 while for @xmath3 we have @xmath88 .",
    "this gives us a robust evidence of the sufficiently pure @xmath1 and @xmath3 selection .",
    "the study of the dependence of the normal asymmetry on the energy of @xmath42 shows a sound agreement with the theoretical calculation . by comparing the values of the normal asymmetry and normal polarization obtained using monte carlo simulation using the relation @xmath89 , we are able to extract the value of the polarimeter analyzing power @xmath90 .",
    "the main systematic uncertainties in @xmath13 come from magnetic field rotation , detector components misalignment , csi(tl ) accidental background , beam profile asymmetry and decay plane rotation .",
    "the important point is that the sources of systematics are mostly the same for both measured decays , so we can estimate the systematic contributions using a large sample of @xmath1 data and then use the same error value for @xmath3 .",
    "most of the systematic effects are canceled by the unique features of the set - up ( azimuthal symmetry , double ratio , etc ) .",
    "we evaluated the contributions from all relevant sources using the mc simulation data and comparing them with the experimental distributions  @xcite .",
    "overall systematic error was estimated to be @xmath91 which is well below the level of the statistical error .",
    "after the analysis of the entire data set collected in the period 1996 - 2000 we obtained the results for both @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "for @xmath1 we selected @xmath92 one- and two - photon forward / backward events and using the angular attenuation factor value extracted from mc simulation ( @xmath93 for @xmath94 events and @xmath95 for @xmath96 events ) the preliminary result @xmath97 is obtained . using the relation @xmath98 ( where @xmath99 is a kinematic factor , evaluated from mc simulation @xmath100 ) we get @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "the dependences of the transverse asymmetry on the beam cycle , @xmath42 energy and magnet sector number indicate no systematic irregularity and thus confirm the robustness of our systematics study .",
    "the results indicate no evidence of t - violation in @xmath1 and can be interpreted as limits on the measured quantities : @xmath102 at 90% c.l . and",
    "@xmath103 at 90% c.l .",
    "we have performed the first measurement of @xmath13 in the @xmath3 decay ( it is also the first @xmath3 measurement below @xmath41 peak ) .",
    "the result obtained for 1996 - 1998 data was published in  @xcite . here",
    "we present the result of the analysis of the whole data set of @xmath104 forward / backward events .",
    "we obtained the value @xmath105 with the evaluated attenuation factor of @xmath106 . similarly to the case of @xmath1 , we see no indication of t - violation in this decay and we can put the limit @xmath107 ( 90% c.l . )",
    "we have performed the new measurement of t - violating muon polarization in two decays @xmath1 and @xmath3 for which several non - standard models predict non - zero @xmath13 values . for @xmath3 decay",
    "our result is the first one . at the current level of the experimental sensitivity",
    ", we see no evidence for t - violation and our results allowed us to impose constraints on several non - standard models : three higgs doublet model ( the most stringent experimental constraint ) , susy with squark mixing , susy with r - parity violation , leptoquark models , left - right symmetric models ( see , for example , ref .",
    "much higher statistical sensitivity to @xmath13 of @xmath108 can be reached in a proposed experiment  @xcite at the high intensity low energy separated kaon beam at j - parc  @xcite .",
