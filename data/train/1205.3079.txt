    "few - layer graphene@xcite is attractive for applications in optoelectronics as transparent conductors where precise control over layer thickness is not necessary owing to its low sheet resistance and high transparency , and in field - effect transistors due to the opening of an electronic bandgap that , at least in bilayer graphene , can be tuned with an electric field.@xcite given that device characteristics depend on the work function of graphene and on how it varies at contacts,@xcite it is of fundamental and practical importance to understand the nature of the contact ( ohmic or schottky ) at metal - graphene interfaces . in the case of monolayer graphene ,",
    "recent studies indicate that the crystallographic orientation of graphene domains with respect to the metal can alter their electronic properties.@xcite for few - layer graphene , the role of the specific metal surface and of the in - plane orientations of those layers on the electrical characteristics of the graphene is not well known .",
    "we choose pd(111 ) , one of the commonly used contact materials recently shown to exhibit low contact resistance,@xcite as a model to investigate the influence of thickness and orientation on the work functions of graphene layers on metals .    here , we present results of in situ low - energy electron microscopy ( leem ) and density functional theory ( dft ) investigations of the growth structure and work function of bilayer graphene on pd(111 ) .",
    "selected area low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) patterns indicate that bernal stacking is typically not observed in the as - grown graphene layers . from the electron reflectivity data , we have extracted work functions of graphene domains as a function of the in - plane orientations of the top and bottom layers . for monolayer graphene",
    ", we have previously shown that the work functions can vary by up to  0.15 ev depending on the orientation of the domains with respect to the substrate.@xcite different registries between the graphene monolayer and the pd(111 ) substrate lead to strong spatial variations of the charge transfer between the graphene and substrate .",
    "the resulting net surface dipole moment varies with the in - plane orientation of the monolayer . in case of bilayer graphene",
    ", we find that a smaller net electric dipole develops between the topmost graphene layer and the rest of the system ( _ i.e. _ , the monolayer - covered substrate ) .",
    "the direction of this secondary dipole moment is opposite to that of the dipole developed at the pd / graphene interface , and leads to an increase in the work function as compared to monolayer - covered pd .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of the secondary dipole changes with the orientation of the second layer .",
    "this observation suggests that the first graphene layer does not fully passivate the substrate but allows charge transfer into the second layer , thus affecting the work function of the supported bilayer graphene .",
    "all of our experiments are carried out using a carbon - saturated pd(111 ) single crystal in an ultra - high vacuum ( uhv , base pressure @xmath0 torr ) leem system .",
    "sample preparation and other experimental details are presented in ref .  .",
    "graphene layers of desired thickness are obtained by cooling from @xmath1 900 @xmath2c to lower temperatures , during which c segregates from the bulk to the surface .",
    "for example , monolayer graphene is obtained when the sample is cooled from @xmath1 900 to @xmath1 790 @xmath2c at the rate of @xmath1 1 k / s . upon completion of the first layer , further cooling to @xmath1 700 @xmath2c or lower yields multilayer graphene .",
    "bright - field leem images are acquired as a function of time at the annealing temperature .",
    "the direct observation of graphene formation helps identify the layer thickness and is also useful in understanding the nucleation and growth kinetics .",
    "after the growth of a desired number of layers , the sample is quench - cooled to room temperature .",
    "leem images are then acquired as a function of electron energy e at 0.1 ev intervals between @xmath3 = -5 and 30 ev and 0.01 ev intervals between @xmath3 = 0.0 and 2.5 ev . from the leem image intensity @xmath4 vs. @xmath3 data ,",

    "the sample is cooled from 790 @xmath2c when the surface was already covered with 1 ml graphene ( fig .",

    "[ fig1:leem]b - d , as we show below , are multilayer stacks of graphene .",
    "( the black contrast region observed along the upper right corner of the leem images is due to a three - dimensional pd mound on the surface . )",
    "we observe three interesting phenomena : ( i ) growth occurs at selected locations on the sample , suggestive of heterogeneous nucleation , presumably at surface defects ; ( ii ) multiple layers nucleate and grow simultaneously , _",
    "i.e. _ , third and higher layers appear before the completion of the second layer . in this measurement sequence , within 205 s of cooling to 660 @xmath2c , most of the nucleated sites are covered with ten or more layers of graphene at the nucleation sites ( see fig .  [",
    "fig1:leem]d ) ; and ( iii ) the multilayer domains are faceted with regular triangular and/or truncated hexagonal shapes , indicative of strong anisotropy in step energies .",
    "we explain this observation as follows .",
    "graphene s honeycomb lattice gives rise to two types of simple edge structures , armchair and zigzag .",
    "the angle between any two armchair or any two zigzag edges is 60@xmath2 or 120@xmath2 , and that between armchair and zigzag edges is 30@xmath2 or 90@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , if the edges of the equilateral triangular and/or truncated hexagonal shapes are simple , they must all be either zigzag or armchair in structure . by comparing the directions of domain edges observed in the leem images with the leed spot orientations , we determined that the domains are bounded by graphene sheets with zigzag edges .",
    "we suggest that asymmetries in the geometry of zigzag edges relative to an adjacent graphene layer may account for the anisotropic shapes of multilayer domains .",
    "the asymmetry is most easily illustrated for the case of two bernal - stacked layers , as shown in fig .  [ fig2:edges ] .",
    "all of the armchair edges are equivalent",
    ". however , any two zigzag edges oriented at 120@xmath2 to each other are not equivalent , analogous to the a- and b- type steps on ( 111)-oriented face - centered cubic crystals .",
    "as we describe in the next section , however , none of the observed graphene bilayer domains exhibit bernal stacking ( see fig .  [ fig3:leem - multilayergr ] ) .",
    "yet , it is possible that the energies of both armchair and zigzag edges can vary with their orientation relative to the adjacent layer .",
    "this may explain the observation of multiple types of anisotropic shapes .        in the following sections , we report the thickness , crystallographic orientation , and work functions of the graphene layers . fig .",

    "in all of the leed patterns , we find that one of the layers in multilayer graphene is oriented at the same angle ( @xmath21 in the example of fig .",
    "3 ) as in the 1 ml graphene that surrounds the multilayer stack .",
    "this observation suggests that orientation of the top layer graphene is unaffected during the growth of subsequent layers , consistent with the expected growth of multiple layers below the layer that grows first.@xcite from leed patterns acquired from over 10 different regions of the sample , we identified at least 12 different in - plane orientations in bilayer graphene . in all cases the two layers",
    "are not rotationally aligned , as required for bernal stacking , similar to previous reports.@xcite based upon our data , we suggest that bernal stacking will be rare in graphene layers grown on pd(111 ) .",

    "however , @xmath5 values are precise to within 0.02 ev and , therefore , can be used to compare how @xmath6 changes with orientation and layer thickness .",
    "recently , we reported that @xmath6 of monolayer graphene on pd(111 ) varies with in - plane rotation due to spatial variations in charge transfer at graphene - pd interface.@xcite using the same approach and assuming that @xmath25 = 3.4 ev , we have determined @xmath27 for bilayer graphene domains as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .     and @xmath29 of the two graphene layers .",

    "4 shows the work function values @xmath6 for bilayer graphene plotted at different values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 . for all domain orientations ,",
    "the work function of bilayer graphene is higher than that for monolayer graphene .",
    "our results for @xmath6 of graphene bilayers on pd(111 ) are similar to recent reports on epitaxial graphene grown on sic ( where the @xmath6 of bilayer graphene is also higher than that of a monolayer),@xcite but opposite to those for free - standing graphene transferred onto sio@xmath30,@xcite where @xmath6 is found to decrease with increasing layer thickness .",
    "we note , however , that the effect of domain orientation on the @xmath6 values of bilayer graphene on pd(111 ) is smaller ( up to 0.07 ev ) compared to that observed ( up to 0.15 ev ) in @xmath6 for monolayer graphene domains ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . in order to confirm these results , we determined @xmath6 values using a different procedure , and obtained consistent results .",
    "an important factor that affects the work function of bilayer graphene is the in - plane orientation of the two layers , which we next discuss from the perspective of electronic structure calculations .",
    "in order to gain insights into how the second graphene layer and the orientation of both layers affect the work function , we have performed dft calculations on systems with one and two graphene layers placed on one side of a pd(111 ) substrate .",
    "we have used the siesta code@xcite with double - zeta ( dz ) basis set within the local density approximation ( lda ) with the ceperley - alder exchange - correlation functional .",
    "a uniform grid in real space with a mesh cutoff of 150 ry was used .",
    "the brillouin zone has been sampled only at the @xmath31 point since the unit cells were large , with periodicity vectors of 19.72 .",
    "the residual forces on any atom are smaller than 0.04 ev /    at the end of structural relaxations , and the total energy has been converged to within @xmath32 ev for all electronic property calculations .",
    "we have used @xmath33 surface supercells for the construction of 19.9@xmath2 and 30@xmath2-rotated graphene domains ( 126 c atoms and 128 c atoms , respectively ) , and 46 pd atoms per layer with four pd layers in the substrate . for the 30@xmath2 orientation",
    ", we have adopted the epitaxial structure proposed by giovanetti _",
    "et al._@xcite the choice of the two particular orientations , 19.9@xmath2 and 30@xmath2 , is determined both by the necessity to keep the computations tractable and by the fact that these two orientations can be placed simultaneously on the pd(111 ) substrate with virtually no strain in either of them .",
    "thus , any computed variations in @xmath6 are due only to their orientations and/or stacking order , but not to the ( insignificant ) strain in the graphene layers .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     , vs. values determined directly from dft calculations , @xmath6 .",

    "( 2 ) ] shows that the electrostatic dipole largely accounts for the work function of single- and bi - layer graphene on pd ( fig .",
    "5a ) . for both single- and bi - layer graphene , the values of the dipole moment @xmath39 are positive ( _ i.e. _ , pointing away from the substrate , see table 1 ) and of same order of magnitude as that reported for other graphene - metal systems.@xcite    to account specifically for the influence of the second graphene layer on @xmath6 , we resort to another way of computing the dipole moment , one in which the reference consists of the topmost ( second ) graphene layer and the palladium substrate covered with monolayer graphene , @xmath40 the charge transfer @xmath41 and the dipole moment @xmath42d@xmath36 developed with respect to the new reference are , therefore , much smaller when compared to the transfer to the first layer , as shown in fig .",
    "6 and listed in table 1 .",
    "although smaller , the secondary dipole moment @xmath43 does account for the work function changes between the single- and bi- layer graphene on pd , @xmath44 as seen in fig .",
    "the secondary dipole moment @xmath43 ( table 1 ) is always negative ( _ i.e. _ , it points into the substrate ) , which explains our observation that the work functions of bilayer systems are greater than those of monolayer systems .",
    "we note that although the variations in experimentally measured values are in qualitative agreement with the dft variations , they are smaller than those obtained using dft . possible reasons for the smaller variations in experimental values are ( a ) different orientations used in calculations compared to experiments ( our initial attempts to use the experimental orientations in dft simulations resulted in supercells that were either too large or too strained ) , and ( b ) the presence of elastic strain , carbon adatoms at the graphene - pd interface , or other impurities in graphene layers .    finally , we have also estimated the electron transfer to each graphene layer by integrating the density using as integration limits the midpoints between atomic layers . for computing the electron transfer to the second graphene layer ( topmost ) , we integrated from the midpoint between the first and second graphene layers to the middle of the vacuum .",
    "the results , listed in the last column of table 1 , show that the first graphene layer is @xmath45-doped ( loss of electrons ) , while the second layer is @xmath13-doped .",
    "as seen in table 1 , the magnitude of the electron transfer to the second layer is relatively small and can be attributed to charge screening by the first layer.@xcite the signs of the estimated electronic transfer to each graphene layer are certainly consistent with directions of the calculated dipoles @xmath39 and @xmath43 , _ i.e. _ , a loss of electrons on the first graphene layer leads to a dipole @xmath39 parallel to the surface normal , while a gain of electrons on the second graphene layers leads to a secondary dipole @xmath43 antiparallel to the surface normal .",
    "in conclusion , we used in _ situ _ leem and dft to investigate the growth structure and work function of multilayer graphene on pd(111 ) .",
    "none of the bilayer domains we examined had the rotational alignment required for bernal stacking . instead , there are multiple orientations of the layers relative to the substrate and each other .",
    "the orientation - dependent variations in work functions of bilayer graphene are relatively smaller than those observed in monolayer graphene .",
    "we explain these results using dft calculations , which reveal that the charge transfer from pd depends sensitively on the orientations of both graphene layers .",
    "our results indicate that one can not infer how multilayers of graphene interact with a metal substrate ( for example , in a contact ) by examining only the first layer .",
    "therefore , for the fabrication of graphene - based transistors and/or transparent conductors , knowledge of the graphene layer stacking and its influence on the device characteristics is desirable .    _",
