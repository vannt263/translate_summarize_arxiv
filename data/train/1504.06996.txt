    "modulational instability ( mi ) refers to a process where a weak periodic perturbation of an intense continuous wave ( cw ) grows exponentially as a result of the interplay between dispersion and nonlinearity .",
    "mi constitutes one of the most basic and widespread nonlinear phenomena in physics , and it has been studied extensively in several different physical systems like water waves , plasmas , and optical devices @xcite . for a cubic nonlinearity , as the one occurring in the nonlinear schrdinger equation used to model optical fibers , the underlying physical mechanism can be understood in terms of four - wave mixing between the pump , signal and idler waves",
    ". however , the scalar four - wave interactions in a homogeneous fiber can be phase matched , and hence efficient , only in the anomalous group - velocity dispersion ( gvd ) regime . in the normal gvd regime , on the other hand",
    ", mi can occur in detuned cavities @xcite , thanks to constructive interference between the external driving and the recirculating pulse .",
    "alternatively mi with normal gvd can also arise in systems with built - in periodic dispersion @xcite , among which dispersion oscillating fibers ( dofs ) have recently attracted renewed attention @xcite . in this case ,",
    "phase matching relies on the additional momentum carried by the periodic dispersion grating ( quasi - phase - matching ) .",
    "the occurrence of unstable frequency bands can then be explained using the theory of parametric resonance , a well - known instability phenomenon which occurs in linearized systems for which at least one parameter is varied periodically during the evolution @xcite . up to now , most experimental investigations realised in optical fibers have been performed with basic sinusoidal  @xcite or amplitude modulated  @xcite modulation formats . in this work ,",
    "on the other hand , we study a radically different periodic modulation of the gvd , in the form of a periodic train ( or comb ) of dirac delta spikes .",
    "this is a fundamental and widespread modulation format , encountered in a variety of physical systems . in optics ,",
    "delta combs have been exploited to model lumped amplification in long haul fiber optic transmission systems @xcite , or to model the power extraction in soliton based fiber lasers @xcite .",
    "moreover , comb - like dispersion - profiled fibers have been exploited to generate trains of solitons starting from a beat signal @xcite . at more fundamental level kicked systems",
    "are widely investigated as a paradigm for the emergence of chaos in perturbed hamiltonian systems , with the delta - kicked rotor being the most renowned example @xcite .",
    "its quantum version is described by a schrdinger equation forced by a dirac comb and has been extensively analyzed to study chaos in quantum systems @xcite .",
    "recirculating fiber loops have been used to reproduce the quantum kicked rotor with an optical system , to study chaos and anderson localization @xcite , and to illustrate how an optical system can be used to mimic other physical systems that are more difficult to reproduce experimentally . in the same vein ,",
    "we hope the experimental setup we propose in this paper could be used as an experimental platform to investigate such phenomena in the presence of nonlinearities , a topic of much current interest .",
    "finally the approach that we propose to analyse mi in the fiber with delta - kicked gvd allows us , on one hand to enlighten the featuress of the parametric resonance that are not dependent on the specific format of the modulation , and on the other hand to compare and contrast the features of the ideal delta - kicked profile with other formats including non - ideal ( physically realizable ) kicking as well as widely employed profiles such as oscillating gvd .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s : centralfreq ]",
    "we provide a simple argument allowing to determine the central frequencies of the unstable sidebands for general periodically modulated fibers . in section  [ s :",
    "diraccomb ] , we then use floquet theory to analytically compute the width of the gain bands and as well as their maximum gain for dispersion - kicked fibers . in section",

    "note that this is a hamiltonian dynamical system in a two - dimensional phase plane with canonical coordinates @xmath22 . analyzing the linear ( in)stability of the stationary solution @xmath10 therefore reduces to studying the solutions to   for each @xmath23 .",
    "since the coefficients in the equation are @xmath24-periodic with period @xmath6 , floquet theory applies .",
    "this amounts to studying the linearized evolution over one period @xmath6 , to obtain the floquet map @xmath25 which in the present situation is the two by two real matrix defined by @xmath26 . as a result @xmath27 .",
    "note that @xmath28 necessarily has determinant one , since it is obtained by integrating a hamiltonian dynamics , of which we know that it preserves phase space volume . as a consequence , if @xmath29 is one of its eigenvalues , then so are both its complex conjugate @xmath30 and its inverse @xmath31 .",

    "we will explain below that , whereas their precise form depends on the choice of @xmath40 , the position of their tips does not .    since the system   is not autonomous , it can not be solved analytically in general .",

    "the eigenvalues of @xmath45 can be readily computed as @xmath47 what will happen if we now switch on the interaction terms @xmath48 and @xmath49 ?",
    "it is then no longer possible , in general , to give a simple closed form expression of the solution to  , which is no longer autonomous , and hence of the linearized floquet map @xmath50 .",
    "nevertheless , we do know that , for small @xmath51 , the eigenvalues of @xmath50 must be close to the eigenvalues @xmath52 .",

    "they then must remain on the unit circle under perturbation since , for the reasons explained above , they can not move into the complex plane away from the unit circle .",
    "consequently , in this case , the stationary solution @xmath10 is linearly stable under a sufficiently small perturbation by @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and this statement does not depend on the precise form of @xmath48 or of @xmath49 .",
    "in fact , with growing @xmath36 and/or @xmath37 , the two eigenvalues will move along the unit circle until they meet either at @xmath57 or at @xmath58 for some critical value of the perturbation parameters . only for values of the latter above that critical value",

    "finally , it is interesting to note that a sinusoidal modulation @xmath69 , with the same value of @xmath36 , gives a gain close to one half with respect to the delta case . indeed for a sinusoidal modulation , it has been shown that ( see equation  ( 7 ) from ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath151 by expanding equation  ( [ gmax_sin ] ) for small @xmath36 , we get @xmath152 at first order in @xmath36 . in conclusion , a large concentrated perturbation of the gvd about its average enhances the mi gain .",
    "it is well known that in homogeneous fibers , the gvd depends on the diameter of the fiber .",

    "to do so experimentally in fibers b and c , we slightly tuned the pump wavelength until the first mi side lobe is generated at 4.8 thz as in fiber a. as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp et simul](a ) ( red and black curves ) , the position of the first mi side lobe in fibers b and c is indeed located at that frequency by tuning the pump wavelength to 1061.8 nm and 1067 nm , respectively . we can therefore consider that the average gvd values are very similar in the three fibers and hence that only the areas of the gaussian functions , i.e. the equivalent of the dirac weights , vary .",
    "the amplitudes of the first mi side lobes generated in fibers b and c are indeed larger compared to fiber a , as predicted by the theory .",
    "this is in pretty good agreement with numerical simulations ( fig.[fig : exp et simul](b ) ) , where the same procedure was used .",
    "we found that the average values in fibers b and c are @xmath183 and @xmath184 respectively .",
    "the small discrepancy between these values is attributed to spurious longitudinal fluctuations arising during the drawing process . indeed , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fibres exp](a ) , the background over which gaussian pulses are superimposed is not perfectly flat , and in fibre c , it is not horizontal . to counterbalance these imperfections , it was necessary to adjust the average dispersion values .",
    "we checked that with a series of perfect gaussian pulses superimposed on a flat and horizontal background , the same average gvd value would be obtained .",
    "furthermore , we can note that in fibers b and c , additional mi side lobes are generated due to the periodic modulation of the gvd ( labelled mii in [ fig : exp et simul](a ) , up to 5 in fiber b ) .",
    "their positions are also well predicted by numerical simulations and by equation  [ omega_l ] ( green lines in [ fig : exp et simul](b ) ) .",
    "this excellent agreement confirms that their positions indeed scale approximately as @xmath185 , @xmath186 being the side lobe order , that is the typical signature of the mi process occurring in dispersion oscillating fibers .",
    "it was already reported experimentally in refs.@xcite , with a sinusoidal variation of the gvd , modulated in amplitude or not and it is now illustrated in this paper with a dirac delta comb .",
    "moreover , in fibers b and c two symmetric side lobes that are not predicted by the theory appear around the pump at about 2.15 thz ( labelled spurious side lobes in fig.[fig : exp et simul](a ) ) .",
    "they result from a non - phase matched four - wave mixing process involving the pump , the first and second mi side lobes .",
    "the energy conservation relation involving these waves predicts a frequency shift of 2.2 thz from the pump for the fourth wave , that is in good agreement with the shift of 2.15 thz measured experimentally .",

    "modulation instability has been investigated theoretically and experimentally in dispersion kicked optical fibers .",
    "an analytical expression of the parametric gain has been obtained allowing to predict the behavior of the mi process in such fibers .",
    "specifically , it was shown that increasing the weights of the dirac functions leads to larger mi gains for the first mi side lobe .",
    "we exploit the fact that the dirac delta comb can be well approximated by a series of short gaussian pulses in order to perform an experimental investigation using microstructured optical fibers .",
    "we then experimentally report , for the first time to our knowledge , multiple mi side lobes at the output of these dispersion kicked optical fibers .",
    "we demonstrate that they originate from the periodic variations of the dispersion .",
    "we also validate experimentally that increasing the height of the modulation leads to a larger gain for the first mi side lobe .",
