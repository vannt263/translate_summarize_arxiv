    "although colliders give well - known advantages compared to the fixed target experiments , the kinematics of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at colliders creates certain complications in the beam monitoring as well as in the identification of collision events .    due to the geometrical factor @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the impact parameter",
    ", the number of central nuclear collisions ( @xmath5 ) is relatively very small in the whole set of the collisions with nuclear overlap , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the nuclear radii ) .",
    "moreover , in peripheral collisions without direct overlap of nuclear densities , @xmath9 , one or both nuclei may be disintegrated by the long - range electromagnetic forces .",
    "this process of electromagnetic dissociation ( ed ) is a well - known phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "the properties of central and peripheral collisions are very different and then should be studied separately .",
    "the ed events are less violent than the collisions with the participation of strong interactions .",
    "namely , the average particle multiplicities are essentially lower  @xcite and the main part of nucleons and mesons is produced in projectile and target fragmentation regions , very far from the mid - rapidity region .",
    "calculations show  @xcite that the ed cross section in collisions of heavy nuclei at rhic and lhc by far exceeds the dissociation cross section due to the direct nuclear overlap . in @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "collisions at such energies many neutrons can be produced in the ed process  @xcite . among other interesting phenomena",
    "one may expect a complete disintegration of nuclei induced by the electromagnetic fields of collision partners  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is very well known in nuclear reactions under the name of `` multifragmentation ''  @xcite .",
    "several operational problems of heavy - ion colliders are connected with the high rate of the ed process . on the one hand ,",
    "the ed process reduces the lifetimes of heavy ion beams in colliders as compared with the proton - proton accelerator mode  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the process of simultaneous neutron emission from the collision partners , where the ed process plays a dominant role , can be useful for the luminosity monitoring  @xcite .",
    "the luminosity monitoring method based on mutual dissociation has several advantages  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the beam - residual - gas interaction events can be strongly suppressed in favour of the beam - beam events by the condition that a pair of neutrons should be detected in coincidence by each arm of the calorimeter .",
    "the cross section of mutual neutron emission can be calculated in the framework of conventional theoretical models designed for describing the heavy ion disintegration in peripheral collisions .",
    "corresponding nuclear data , especially photoneutron emission cross sections , may be used as numerical input for such calculations .",
    "therefore , the neutron counting rates in zero degree ( very forward ) calorimeters may provide an accurate measure for the heavy - ion collider luminosity .    in the present paper the neutron emission in peripheral collisions of ultrarelativistic heavy ions",
    "is considered with the aim of providing the theoretical basis for the luminosity monitoring method proposed in refs .",
    "the uncertainties in results originating from uncertainties in input nuclear data and in the theoretical model itself are carefully examined .",
    "a brief review of corresponding photonuclear data is given with special attention to the publications describing data evaluation and re - measurement .",
    "model predictions for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 fragmentation cross sections are compared with recent experimental data obtained in fixed target experiments at cern sps with the highest energies available thus far .",
    "this serves as an important test before extrapolating our methods to the rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the electromagnetic excitation of one of the collision partners , @xmath14 , followed by its dissociation is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ em ] . in such a process",
    "another partner , @xmath15 , emits a photon , but remains in the ground state without any nuclear excitation .",
    "besides this `` classical '' process , one can consider a non - classical process where the emission of a photon is accompanied by the nuclear excitation ( see fig .  [ emfirst ] ) , particularly , the giant resonance excitation .",
    "such lowest - order contribution to the simultaneous ( mutual ) excitation of the nuclei @xmath15 and @xmath14 was considered in refs .",
    "also the correction to photon - photon luminosity function due to the inelastic photon emission was considered in ref .",

    "@xcite ) , the lowest order process of simultaneous excitation of the collision partners has a small cross section . for the cases of interest ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath10 and @xmath11 collisions , the cross sections for the simultaneous dipole - dipole excitation of such nuclei are 0.49 and 0.54 mb , respectively  @xcite . using a rough estimation of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath17  mb , one can get for the same nuclei 0.39 and 0.43 mb , respectively . from the following discussion",
    "one will see that for heavy nuclei these first order contributions ( fig .",
    "[ emfirst ] ) are negligible compared to the second order ones ( fig .",
    "[ emsecond ] ) .",
    "the latter leading order process with exchange of two photons is a classically allowed mechanism .",
    "it is considered in the next section where the formalism previously used in ref .",
    "@xcite is extended to the case of mutual excitation .",
    "let us consider a collision of heavy ultrarelativistic nuclei at impact parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the masses and charges of these nuclei are denoted as @xmath15 , @xmath18 and @xmath14 , @xmath19 , respectively . hereafter the case of equal nuclei ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) is investigated .",
    "nevertheless , in some cases the indexes are used to show explicitly which of the collision partners emits or absorbs photons .    according to the weizscker - williams ( ww ) method  @xcite ,",
    "the impact of the lorentz - boosted coulomb field of the nucleus @xmath15 on @xmath14 is treated as the absorption of an equivalent photon by the nucleus @xmath14 ( see fig .  [ em ] ) . in the rest frame of this nucleus the spectrum of virtual photons from the collision partner @xmath15 at impact parameter @xmath4",

    "@xmath35 one usually takes the neutron emission threshold , while the upper limit of integration is @xmath36 .",

[ em ] ) leading to a certain dissociation channel @xmath38 as : @xmath39 where the probability of dissociation at impact parameter @xmath4 is defined as : @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the branching ratio for the considered channel @xmath38 in the absorption of a photon with energy @xmath42 on nucleus @xmath14 .",
    "the choice of a critical impact parameter @xmath43 , which separates the domains of nuclear and electromagnetic interactions , will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ parameters ] .",
    "let us turn now to the mutual dissociation process shown in fig .",
    "[ emsecond ] .",
    "the corresponding graph may be constructed from two graphs of the single dissociation by interchanging the roles of `` emitter '' and `` absorber '' at the secondary photon exchange .",
    "several assumptions have to be made to obtain an expression for the mutual dissociation cross section .",
    "firstly , we suppose that the emitted photon with energy @xmath44 does not change essentially the total energy , @xmath45 , of the emitting nucleus , where @xmath46 is the nuclear mass .",
    "this can be justified by estimating the ratio @xmath47 which is close to @xmath48 for heavy nuclei .",
    "therefore , the kinematical conditions for the secondary photon exchange are very similar to those for the primary one , and there are no correlations between the energies of the primary and secondary photons , @xmath42 and @xmath49 . in other words , the primary and secondary photon exchanges may be considered as independent processes even if they take place in the same collision during a short - term overlap of the lorentz - contracted coulomb fields of the colliding nuclei . secondly , the equivalent photon spectrum from the excited nucleus , @xmath50 in the notations of fig .  [ emsecond ] , is the same as the spectrum from the nucleus in its ground state , @xmath14 .",
    "this follows from the fact that at ultrarelativistic energies the collision time is much shorter then the characteristic deexcitation time during which a nucleus changes its initial charge via proton emission or fission .",
    "following these assumptions , one can express the cross section for the _ mutual _ dissociation of nuclei @xmath15 and @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ emsecond ] ) to channels @xmath38 and @xmath51 , respectively , as : @xmath52 substituting eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) for each of the nuclei and changing the order of integration one obtains : @xmath53 where the spectral function @xmath54 for mutual dissociation is introduced : @xmath55 conditions @xmath20 and @xmath21 were used in eqs .",
    "( [ smfull ] ) and ( [ nm ] ) , as it is usually in heavy - ion colliders , and therefore @xmath56 .",
    "nevertheless , the dissociation channels @xmath38 and @xmath51 may be different for each of the nuclei even in such case .    several remarks may be made concerning eqs .",
    "( [ smfull ] ) and ( [ nm ] ) . compared to another process of the second order dissociation of a single nucleus (",
    "see fig .  [ em2 ] ) some points of similarity may be found .",
    "indeed , expressions given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the corresponding cross section @xmath57 of the second order process are as following : @xmath58 @xmath59 however , there is an important difference in the definitions of branching ratios @xmath41 , @xmath60 compared with @xmath61 , since the former are for the absorption of two photons by _ two different _ nuclei leading to certain dissociation channels @xmath38 and @xmath51 , while the latter is for the absorption of two photons by a _",
    "nucleus leading to a channel @xmath38 .",
    "another difference is due to an additional factor of @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ smfull ] ) compared with eq .",
    "( [ sd ] ) .",
    "it comes from the fact that eq .",
    "( [ smfull ] ) contains the product of the poisson probabilities for the single photon absorption for the collision with impact parameter @xmath4 : @xmath63 while @xmath64 is the poisson probability for the double photon absorption  @xcite .",

    "[ lhc ] .      the second order process , which is shown in fig .  [ emsecond ] and considered in sec",
    ".  [ emd_main ] , is the leading order mechanism of mutual electromagnetic dissociation .",
    "this is confirmed by the calculations of the corresponding total cross sections for the leading order ( lo ) , fig .",

    "[ emsecond ] : @xmath66 here the case of equal masses and charges of collision partners is considered , i.e. @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    for the nlo process with exchange of three photons ( @xmath67 ) ,",
    "[ emnlo12 ] , the total cross section is given by : @xmath68 a complementary process ( @xmath69 ) with the excitation of another nucleus , @xmath14 , via double photon absorption is equally possible and has the same cross section .",
    "another nlo process of mutual dissociation is due to exchange of four photons ( @xmath70 ) , fig .",
    "[ emnlo22 ] , and its cross section can be written as : @xmath71    finally , one can calculate the sum of all contributions using the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath72 since for each of the ions the probability of collision without photon exchange is equal to @xmath73 , eq.([smtot ] ) is evident .",
    "calculations of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and cross sections for specific dissociation channels , @xmath77 , with and without nlo corrections were performed by the modified reldis code , which contains now a special simulation mode for the mutual electromagnetic dissociation process .",
    "our results for the total dissociation cross sections in electromagnetic and nuclear interactions are given in tab .",
    "these cross sections values are in good agreement with results of other authors .",
    "the total cross sections for mutual electromagnetic dissociation given in tab .  [ t1 ] are much lower than the cross sections for single dissociation .",
    "however , even the former values are found to be comparable to the total nuclear dissociation cross sections , see tab .",
    "[ t1 ] .",
    "as one can see , the ratios between the first and second order processes are very different for single and mutual dissociation .",
    "the first order dissociation process ( with exchange of a single photon ) can be safely neglected in considering the mutual dissociation of heavy nuclei at ultrarelativistic energies .    tab .",
    "[ t1 ] contains also the cross sections for lo process , @xmath75 .",
    "as one can see , the lo mechanism gives @xmath78% and @xmath79% of the @xmath74 at rhic and lhc energies , respectively .",
    "the sum of the nlo contributions to the total cross section gives additional @xmath8027% .",
    "therefore , at rhic energies , for example , the remaining contribution of @xmath81% ( or @xmath82 b ) is due to exotic triple excitations .",
    "finally , @xmath83 and @xmath84 written for the lo mutual dissociation process , eqs .",
    "( [ smfull ] ) and ( [ nm ] ) , can be easily generalized to the case of different nlo processes .",

    "several nucleons can be abraded from collision partners in grazing nuclear collisions .",
    "we are interested in a situation when only few nucleons are removed .",
    "this is the case when nuclear densities overlap weakly and mainly nuclear periphery is involved in the interaction .",
    "the cross section for the abrasion of @xmath85 nucleons from the projectile @xmath86 in a collision with the target @xmath87 may be derived from the glauber multiple scattering theory  @xcite : @xmath88 here @xmath89 is calculated as the overlap of projectile , @xmath90 , and target @xmath91 densities in the collision with impact parameter @xmath4 : @xmath92 where the nuclear thickness functions , @xmath93 are introduced . in our calculations",
    "the nuclear density functions are approximated by fermi functions : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a parameter which defines the nuclear half - density radius , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 fm is the diffuseness parameter .",
    "the choice of these and other important parameters of the model , the integration cutoff parameter , @xmath98 , and the total nucleon - nucleon cross section , @xmath99 , is discussed in sec .",
    "[ parameters ] .",
    "the above expressions determine only the number of nucleons removed from the projectile and do not specify how many protons or neutrons were knocked out .",
    "further assumptions are needed to determine the charge - to - mass ratio of the residual nucleus and hence the numbers of protons , @xmath100 , and neutrons , @xmath101 , abraded from the initial nucleus ( see also the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the present work we use the so - called hypergeometrical model  @xcite , assuming that each removed projectile nucleon has a @xmath102 probability ( @xmath103 ) of being a neutron : @xmath104 in other words this means that there is no correlation at all between the proton and neutron distributions and the abrasion process removes protons and neutrons from the projectile nucleus in a random way .",
    "several physical processes , which might be important in heavy - ion collisions , were neglected in this model .",
    "the excited residual nucleus created due to the abrasion process should undergo its de - excitation on the second ablation step . on this step",
    "more neutrons may be emitted via evaporation . however , as it was noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the excitation energies obtained on abrasion step due to removal of one or two nucleons are generally not sufficient for intensive particle evaporation .",
    "therefore , for the cases of interest , i.e. @xmath105 and @xmath106 dissociation channels , the ablation step can be neglected .",
    "the abrasion of nucleons from projectile and target proceeds via high - energy collisions between nucleons .",
    "nucleon - antinucleon pairs may be created in such interactions and neutrons may be presented in these pairs . however , as one can find in a compilation  @xcite , even at high energies @xmath107 agev , the relative rate of such pair production is not so high , @xmath108 . because of this , we do not consider such processes in calculations of the neutron emission cross sections .    knocked - out nucleons can also suffer a final state interaction with spectators  @xcite .",
    "we believe that this process is less important at high energies compared with intermediate energies of @xmath109 agev . for the latter case",
    "the escape probability is estimated to be @xmath110 for peripheral collisions of heavy nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the momenta of recoil nucleons may be comparable with the fermi momentum of intranuclear nucleons and their angular distribution is very wide so that they can be easily captured by one of the spectators .",
    "the situation is different at high energies , where the transverse momenta of collided nucleons are typically large , of order of 0.5 gev , and therefore their subsequent capture is less probable .",
    "other effects like a finite hadronization length may further reduce the secondary interaction probability .",
    "therefore , we assume that in peripheral collisions at rhic and lhc the probability for each of the collided nucleons to escape the residual nuclei is close to unity , @xmath111 .    as we will show in sec .",
    "[ comparison ] , the above - mentioned simplifications do not lead to noticeable disagreements with experimental data when the removal of one , two or three nucleons is considered .",
    "it means that either above mentioned physical effects are negligible , or they compensate each other in peripheral nuclear collisions with removal of only few nucleons .",
    "however , the predictions of the present model for more central collisions with removal of many nucleons should be taken with care .",
    "this simple abrasion model can be easily extended to the case of mutual dissociation .",

    "( [ abr_main ] ) and ( [ hyper ] ) was used .",
    "as shown in sec .  [ emtheory ] , the photonuclear cross sections are used as input data in calculations of the electromagnetic dissociation cross sections .",
    "this is verified by the coherent nature of the photon emission by the collision partner as a whole .",
    "since these photons represent the lorentz - boosted coulomb fields of original nuclei , their virtuality is very small , @xmath123 , i.e. these photons are almost real .",
    "therefore , one can use the photonuclear reaction data obtained in experiments with real monoenergetic photons and apply theoretical models describing such photonuclear reactions .",
    "the accuracy of the mutual dissociation cross section calculation depends heavily on the quality of the data and parameters used as input .",

    "simultaneous gdr excitation in both of the nuclei is a dominant process leading to the mutual dissociation , but it is responsible only for a part of the total mutual dissociation cross section , @xmath280 at rhic , for example . the rest is provided mainly by asymmetric processes , when one of the nuclei is excited in a gdr state , while another nucleus absorbs a photon with the energy above the gdr region , which leads to emission of many neutrons .    as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : rhic ] and [ fig : lhc ] , the probabilities of the simultaneous emission of three and more neutrons are small and such processes with participation of high energy photons are distributed over the large area in the plots .    for the sake of completeness the cross sections of the mutual dissociation without neutrons emitted from one or both of the collision partners are also included . the rates of such processes , when mainly the proton emission takes place , are small .",
    "this is another difference between the electromagnetic and nuclear dissociation .",
    "the nuclear interaction events , when only a proton is removed from one or both of the nuclei , are very probable , see figs .",
    "[ fig : rhic ] and [ fig : lhc ] .",
    "since its experimental discovery , the process of electromagnetic dissociation of heavy ions has been studied only in fixed target experiments . in the year 2000",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) became operational at bnl and among other experiments the electromagnetic dissociation of ultrarelativistic heavy ions can now be investigated in collider kinematics by means of the zero degree calorimeters ( zdc )  @xcite .",
    "this makes possible to study the mutual heavy ion dissociation process for the first time .    in the present paper",
    "the equivalent photon method and the abrasion model for grazing nuclear collisions were extended to the case of mutual dissociation of collision partners .",
    "our numerical results for the total heavy ion dissociation cross sections are very close to the results of related studies , ref .",
    "@xcite . restricting ourselves to the domain of equivalent photon energies below 24 mev ,",
    "where only the giant resonance excitations are possible in electromagnetic dissociation , we obtained the cross section of correlated 1n-1n emission close to one of ref .",
    "however , as we have found , at collider energies the neutron emission process in mutual electromagnetic dissociation is not entirely exhausted by the simultaneous excitation and decay of the giant resonances in both of the colliding nuclei . apart from the mutual gdr excitation , asymmetric processes with the gdr excitation in one of the nuclei accompanied by a photonuclear reaction in the other nucleus",
    "are very probable .",
    "a wide set of photonuclear reactions should be taken into account to obtain a realistic estimation of the mutual dissociation rate .",
    "as we found , the cross sections of emission of two and especially three neutrons in mutual dissociation are very sensitive to the presence of the next - to - leading - order processes where a collision partner ( or even both of the nuclei ) absorbs a pair of photons in a collision event .",
    "the contribution of multiple photon absorption processes to the total _ single _ electromagnetic dissociation cross section at ultrarelativistic energies is 12% only .",
    "this is very different from the case of _ mutual _ electromagnetic dissociation where 30 - 40% of events are due to multiple photon absorption .",
    "indeed , the main part of mutual dissociation events takes place in close collisions with small @xmath281 , where the probability to absorb a virtual photon is large , and hence , two or more photons can be absorbed by each of the collision partners .",
    "we have examined the reliability of our results by studying their sensitivity to the variation of input data and parameters . trying to answer a key question on whether the mutual dissociation cross section can be calculated with high accuracy , we have critically reviewed our model assumptions and the results of previous theoretical and experimental studies of photonuclear reactions and heavy ion dissociation processes .",
    "the ambiguity in the calculations of @xmath263 correlated emission cross section alone , @xmath282 , is found to be up to 15% .",
    "this is mainly due to the difference in the values of the photoneutron cross sections measured in different experiments .",
    "however , the ambiguity is lower , @xmath283% , if the sum of one and two neutron emission channels , @xmath284 , is considered .",
    "therefore , it is a kind of cumulative neutron emission rate which should be used as the luminosity measure at colliders .",
    "we have found several distinctive features of the mutual electromagnetic dissociation process which are helpful for its experimental identification . beside the enhancement of @xmath105 and @xmath106 emission channels",
    ", the electromagnetic interaction leads to very asymmetric mutual dissociation channels where only one neutron is lost by one collision partner while many neutrons are lost by another partner .",
    "such dissociation pattern is very unlikely in grazing nuclear collisions with participation of the strong nuclear forces .",
    "the correlated emission of one or two neutrons in both the forward and backward directions without any additional particles in the mid - rapidity region can be used as a clear sign of the electromagnetic dissociation of ultrarelativistic heavy ions .",
    "the identification of such mutual dissociation events and counting their rates in both arms of zdc along with the calculation results of the present paper can provide a basis for an absolute luminosity calibration at rhic .",
    "similar methods can be used for the alice heavy ion experiment  @xcite planned at the future large hadron collider ( lhc ) to be build at cern .",
