    "the emergence of classical behavior in quantum systems is a topic of great interest from both conceptual and experimental points of view @xcite .",
    "it is well established by now that the interaction between a quantum system and an external environment can lead to its classicalization ; decoherence and the occurrence of classical correlations being the main features of this process ( for a recent overview see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most intriguing prospects in quantum physics is the possibility of observing quantum tunneling on macroscopic scales @xcite .",
    "macroscopic systems are generally open systems , interacting with an external environment , and in this context quantum tunneling is qualitative different from its experimentally verified microscopic analogue @xcite .    the analysis of open systems has led to interesting results , detailing the dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a thermal bath with arbitrary temperature .",
    "a closed quantum system described by a state localized around a meta - stable minimum , should tunnel through the potential barrier with a well defined time - scale .",
    "this tunneling time can be estimated using standard techniques such as the instaton method @xcite . for an open system ,",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that the environment induces decoherence on the quantum particle , its behavior becoming classical as soon as interference terms are destroyed by the external noise @xcite .",
    "this transition from a quantum to a classical behavior is forced by the interaction with a robust environment and takes place at a given time - scale , the decoherence time @xcite .",
    "this quantity depends on the properties of the system , its environment and their mutual coupling .",
    "if the decoherence time is significantly smaller than the tunneling time , one would expect that after classicalization the state should become confined to the meta - stable vacuum , with tunneling being suppressed .",
    "the particle could still cross the barrier but only if excited by the bath , its energy increasing via thermal activation , for example .",
    "this process is distinct from quantum tunneling , is classical in its nature and should be efficient mostly at high environmental temperatures .",
    "an interesting question arises : what is the effect on tunneling if the particle is coupled to a reservoir at zero temperature ?",
    "though in this case there should be in principle no thermal activation , we know there is decoherence induced by a quantum environment at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "this would lead to classicalization and one could conclude that even at @xmath1 , quantum tunneling should be inhibited by the interaction with the external environment @xcite .",
    "the study of the effects of an external environment on tunneling was initiated by caldeira and legget @xcite who showed that dissipation inhibits tunneling .",
    "dissipation in the primary system is not the only result of the interaction with the external environment .",
    "not only does the bath lead to the renormalization of the coupling constants and of the frequency but it dissipation induces fluctuation ( noise ) on the system as well @xcite .",
    "since this ground - breaking study @xcite , many other works have looked at the various aspects of the same phenomenon arriving more often than not at similar conclusions @xcite .",
    "what s even more appealing is the fact that nearly all studies rely on analytical techniques , either functional based approaches or generalizations of instanton - type calculations .",
    "these approaches are based on equilibrium concepts and may miss important dynamical aspects of the evolution . in particular , it is hard to treat both tunneling and activation - like effects simultaneously , and to differentiate their individual contribution to the outcomes .    since the early works on open quantum systems ,",
    "computational power has increased hugely and it is now feasible to test and extend many analytical results using large - scale numerical simulations . in the context of simulations of open - systems with tunneling effects , the main focus has been on driven systems , where tunneling between regular and non - regular islands is of interest @xcite . in these models , the interplay of classical chaos and dissipation bears interesting effects at the boundary between classical and quantum mechanics , e.g. , the elimination of classical chaos by quantum interference , or its restoration by dissipation .    in this article",
    "we will concentrate on a simple tunneling system described by a static hamiltonian . specifically",
    ", we will look in detail at the evolution of a particle in a quantum state localized at one of the minima of a double well potential , when coupled to an external environment at both zero and high temperature .",
    "we will present an analytical description of the effects of dissipation and diffusion , and estimate the time - scales associated with the distinct physical processes governing the dynamics of the system : decoherence , quantum tunneling and activation . using large - scale numerical simulations we",
    "will then be able to obtain a full description of the dynamics of the model , and test the analytical estimates .",
    "moreover , since we will have access to the state of the system at any time , we will be able to distinguish between the effects of the several processes mentioned above .    as we will discuss below",
    ", we confirm that in the high - temperature regime , the evolution can be indeed well understood in terms of simple decoherence , tunneling and activation time - scales .",
    "this enlightens the problem conceptually and offers a great degree of control over the behavior of the system . in particular",
    ", we will see how the environment can be manipulated in order to delay or accelerate decoherence , and how the strength of the bath s coupling allows activation to be retarded .",
    "the estimates provided can be used in wider situations and hopefully be generalized to realistic systems with tunneling on macroscopic scales .",
    "finally , we will show than in the particular case of a zero temperature environment , not only tunneling is inhibited , but contrarily to what may be naively expected , noise - activation is also observed .",
    "consequently , at large times after decoherence , the particle has always a non - zero probability of crossing the potential barrier .",
    "we will discuss how this result can be understood by means of a the classical finite - temperature analogue .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present our model and derive estimates of the relevant scales involved . in section iii",
    "we analyze the high temperature limit , showing how decoherence inhibits tunneling and describing thermal activation in the classical regime .",
    "this is done using both analytical and numerical results .",
    "section iv contains a similar analysis detailing the case of zero environmental temperature . finally , in section",
    "v , we include our final remarks and in the appendix we expand on more technical details of calculations relevant for the body of the paper .",
    "we will start by considering a quantum anharmonic oscillator with a potential given by @xmath2 .",
    "this is a double well potential with two absolute minima at @xmath3 separated by a potential barrier with height @xmath4 .",
    "we will assume that the system is open , meaning that it is coupled to an environment composed of an infinite set of harmonic oscillators @xcite .",

    "the mass of the anharmonic oscillator is set to one .",
    "the main system is coupled linearly to each oscillator in the bath with strength @xmath9 .",
    "this action describes one of the most simple quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) models , which has been widely used in the study of quantum to classical transition phenomena @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the non - linear oscillator can be obtained by tracing over the degrees of freedom of the environment and obtaining a master equation for the reduced density matrix of the system , @xmath10 .",
    "we will assume that the initial states of the system and environment are uncorrelated , with the latter being in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath11 ( possibly zero ) for @xmath0 ( i.e when the interaction between system and environment is switched on ) .",
    "at the initial time , the state is a product of a given state of system ( entirely on the left well ) and a thermal state for the environment . only when the interaction is turned on the system",
    "is allowed to evolve .",
    "the initial condition is not an equilibrium state of the complete action . under these assumptions , and using that the system - environment coupling is small , the reduced density matrix satisfies the following time - convolutionless master equation @xcite :    @xmath12 \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\int_0^t d\\tau \\left\\ { \\nu(\\tau ) \\,[x(t),[x(-\\tau),\\rho_{\\rm r}(t ) ] ] \\right .",

    "we will work in the under - damped case , which ensures the validity of the perturbative solutions up to the times we are interested in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will keep in mind that we are considering an ohmic environment and consider situations in which @xmath13 .",
    "this is a weakly - interacting setting and from it one can define the temporal domain of validity for perturbative solutions .",

    "it is worth noting that eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) is valid at any temperature , and is local in time , despite the fact that no markovian approximation was explicitly taken . in the next few sections",
    ", we will show how the general master equation simplifies in different regimes , making it more tractable for both analytical and numerical techniques .    as discussed in section",
    "[ intro ] , we are interested in studying tunneling - like phenomena . with this in mind , we will look at the evolution of a state for which the particle is initially localized in one of the sides of the double potential well . in particular",

    "we should take into account that once the main system is coupled to the environment , the oscillator changes its frequency to a shifted one due to the coupling .",
    "we will set parameters in order that this frequency shift can be neglected at all times ( we will come back to this point below , when we discuss numerical results at zero temperature ) .",
    "the frequency @xmath26 is the natural frequency obtained by expanding @xmath27 in the vicinity of its minimum @xmath28 with @xmath29 , thus , it describes a particle which is `` locally '' in the `` vacuum '' . for the closed system",
    ", we expect the state to tunnel through the potential barrier : after a tunneling time @xmath30 , the wave function should be approximately given by a gaussian with similar width centered on the right - hand minimum of the potential .",
    "the tunneling time can be estimated using standard techniques .",
    "the initial gaussian is well approximated by a linear combination of the first two energy eigenstates of the full potential @xmath27 .",
    "denoting the energies of the symmetric / anti - symmetric eigenstates by @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively , we expect the tunneling time to be given by @xmath33 . however , as the initial condition eq.([psi0 ] ) is not an exact sum of the two eigenstates , there will be a correction in the tunneling time .",

    "( [ kernel1]-[kernel2 ] ) . the first term on the right - hand side of eq.([wigner_eq ] ) is the poisson bracket , corresponding to the usual classical evolution .",
    "the second term includes the quantum corrections to the dynamics .",
    "the last three terms describe dissipation and diffusion effects due to the coupling to the environment . in order to simplify the problem",
    ", we consider a high - temperature ohmic environment , _",
    "i.e. _ we take @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a high frequency cutoff which is larger than any frequency involved in the system . in this approximation",
    "the coefficients in eq.([wigner_eq ] ) become constant in time : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the anomalous diffusion coefficient @xmath48 is much smaller than the other ones and therefore we neglect it in eq.([wigner_eq ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that the high - temperature approximation is well defined only after a time - scale of the order of @xmath49 .",
    "for all cases we will be studying the relevant period of the evolution lies at much later times , well in the regime where the approximation holds on .    as discussed in section  [ intro ] , the thermal bath will have two distinct effects on the evolution of the initial wave packet . in a regime where the weak coupling to the environment is strong enough , the diffusion will make the initial quantum packet decohere , quantum interference terms will be suppressed and the system will behave classically . after the decoherence time @xmath50 , quantum behavior will be inhibited and tunneling should not be possible any longer . because the initial energy of the particle is less than the barrier height @xmath51 , we would expect it to remain localized on the initial side of the barrier after @xmath50 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the particle is in contact with a high - temperature environment it will `` warm up '' and in time its energy will increase . at some time @xmath52",
    "there will be a significant probability for the particle to cross through the top of the barrier , via thermal activation .",
    "for very long times , the system should reach a state of thermal equilibrium , with the particle being equally likely to be found on either side of the barrier .",
    "we will now estimate these two time - scales .",
    "in particular , we will be interested in understanding how @xmath50 and @xmath52 interplay with each - other , making the crossing of the barrier more or less likely at different stages of the evolution .",
    "the decoherence time in the high - t limit is usually assumed to be inversely proportional to the diffusion term @xmath53 and to the square of the spatial extension of the wave packet @xmath54 . for our choice of initial conditions we assume that for early times @xmath54 can can be set to the width of the original gaussian wave function , that is @xmath55 .",
    "using @xmath56 we obtain ( in units of @xmath16 ) @xcite : @xmath57 though the result is not exact , with @xmath50 being slightly overestimated due to the choice of @xmath54 , its accuracy is enough for our purposes .",
    "the thermal activation rate for a classical system can be obtained by working with the classical analogue of eq .",
    "( [ wigner_eq ] ) , the fokker - planck equation : @xmath58 note that after decoherence takes place and quantum terms become irrelevant for the evolution , eq .",
    "( [ wigner_eq ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) .",
    "the classical evolution for the average of any physical observable @xmath59 in this regime is then given by : @xmath60 if we take @xmath59 to be the hamiltonian of the main system , we obtain @xmath61 .",
    "this expression can be further simplified by assuming @xmath11 to be much higher than the relevant energy scales in the problem , @xmath51 and @xmath62 , during the early stages of the evolution . as a result",
    ", the time dependence of the energy of the system is given by : @xmath63 where @xmath31 is the initial energy of the system .",
    "we can then estimate the thermal activation time @xmath52 to be of the same order of the time it takes the system to reach , on average , the energy of the height of the barrier : @xmath64 when the energy of the initial state is considerably smaller than the potential height this reduces to @xmath65 .",
    "these estimates clearly show that there is a large region of parameter space where it is possible to have decoherence taking place before the tunneling time , and delay considerably thermal activation . in these cases",
    "the particle should remain confined in the original side of the barrier as long as @xmath66 .",
    "ideally we would like to have @xmath50 and @xmath52 separated as much as possible from the tunneling time scale @xmath30 , that is @xmath67 . for practical purposes we write : @xmath68 from the first and last terms we find a restriction on the parameters of the potential :",
    "@xmath69 together with a choice of tunneling time , eq .",
    "( [ v0omega ] ) fixes the potential of the main system .",
    "the parameters of the environment can then be set using the first part of eq .",

    "our goal here is to use a numerical simulation to test and illustrate the suppression mechanism discussed above . in terms of the notation of eq .",
    "( [ tdlltaulltth ] ) we should favour a system with large @xmath73 and small @xmath74 . though such values are perfectly admissible physically , they correspond to a situation which is hard to tackle numerically . from eq .",
    "( [ v0omega ] ) we see that a large ratio of @xmath73 to @xmath74 implies a high value for @xmath75 .",
    "this quantity , @xmath76 , is none other than the semi - classical estimate for the number of states trapped in the potential well .",
    "as we will discuss below , our numerical method is based on evolving an equation for the eigenstates , which will be in large number .",
    "since the tunneling time depends exponentially on @xmath77 , we will also be faced with very large integration times . as a consequence we will have to chose `` conservative '' values for @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "nevertheless , the results will still describe in a conclusive way the phenomena described in the previous section .",
    "the master equation  ( [ wigner_eq ] ) can only be solved by step - by - step methods up to relatively short times . as a way out of this problem we resorted to numerically integrating equation ( [ master ] ) on the basis @xmath78 of eigenstates of the hamiltonian of the isolated system , @xmath79 . on our high@xmath11 limit",
    "this reduces to : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is _ time  independent_. the full expression for @xmath81 can be found in appendix .",
    "we have for notation simplicity dropped the sub - index @xmath82 on @xmath83 .    as equation ( [ rhomunu ] ) has _ constant _ coefficients , it can be integrated up to _ any _ time once the coefficients @xmath81 are numerically calculated .",
    "that means , we can write the exact solution of the master equation ( [ rhomunu ] ) in terms of @xmath81 as : @xmath84 all the difficulty is now shifted to the calculation of the eigenstates @xmath78 of the system @xmath14 , the construction of @xmath81 and the calculation of its exponential . here",
    "problems may arise since @xmath81 has dimension @xmath85 ( where @xmath86 is the dimension of the space representing the real hilbert space of the problem ) .",
    "thus @xmath86 should not be too large .",
    "on the other hand , the number @xmath86 of states should be large enough to faithfully represent the system s hilbert space : as decoherence couples these states , the expected quasi - equilibrium state resulting from the master equation should be diagonal in the eigenstate basis .",
    "the master equation tends to mix these states in such a way that the entropy grows to a level where all states become occupied with equal probability .",
    "this provides a good criterion for the validity of the numerical simulation - in practice we will trust the numerical solution of the master equation only up to times when the entropy @xmath87 is below saturation , _ i.e. _ @xmath88 .",
    "we have solved equation ( [ rhomunu ] ) for the system parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which leads to @xmath91 .",
    "for this set of parameters the estimated tunneling time is @xmath92 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath93 and @xmath94 so that @xmath95 , which is a very small value .",
    "this is to be desired so that the system heats very slowly , delaying thermal activation until after the tunneling time .",
    "finally , we obtain the relation between the three time scales @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    as the initial state",
    "is well expanded by 10 eigenstates of @xmath14 and @xmath98 , we have chosen a hilbert space with @xmath99 which is as large a value of @xmath86 as we can afford numerically . the environment high frequency cutoff is set to @xmath100 for all @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath102 is the frequency separation for eigenstates @xmath103 and @xmath104 .    for the numerical solution of the isolated system",
    "we have very accurately calculated the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the @xmath14 checking that the tunneling time of our initial state  ( [ psi0 ] ) is indeed very close to that estimated by eq .",
    "( [ initial ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] where we show the time evolution of the probability of finding the particle on the original well , for both the isolated and open system . starting from unit at @xmath0 , the probability for the former decreases as the particle tunnels through the barrier , reaching zero when @xmath105 . for longer times",

    "the value of the probability never goes to zero , neither are any oscillations observed .",
    "in fact the probability decreases monotonically and for very long times we should expect it to approach @xmath107 ; when the system thermalizes it is equally probable to find the particle on each side of the barrier .",

    "both the probability distribution plots and the wigner functions corroborate this picture . from very early - times , the negative regions of @xmath113 in the @xmath1 case are considerably suppressed when compared with the closed system , suggesting that tunneling has a small contribution to the evolution . for @xmath194 , @xmath113 becomes positive definite and the system displays no tunneling oscillations . as in the high - t case , the separatrix becomes densely populated when cross - over starts being significant .",
    "both this and the fact that for late times @xmath115 and @xmath113 are symmetrical around @xmath195 , suggests we should be able to describe the dynamics of the open system in terms akin to classical activation .",
    "when trying to interpret the post - decoherence behaviour of the open system , several features of its dynamics should be kept in mind .",
    "firstly , one should emphasize that the initial condition is clearly not the ground state of the total action eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) .",
    "as soon as the interaction between the main system and the environment is turned on , at @xmath0 , the system will find itself in an excited state . in relation to the new minima of the potential",
    ", the environment will have a non - zero amount of energy . from a purely classical point of view",
    ", this energy can not be responsible for the excitation of the particle over the potential barrier .",
    "in fact , the height of the potential increases in relation to the new vacuum , in a way such that the _ total _ energy of the full system is still lower than the barrier separating regions of positive and negative @xmath121 . this argument can be made more quantitative in the following way : the full potential for the system plus environment is @xmath196 with @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 .",
    "classically , the initial condition is @xmath200 , and , because the environment is at t=0 , @xmath201 .",
    "so , for the full action , the energy terms of the initial condition are given by @xmath202 ( the minimum of @xmath203 ) , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 ; and so @xmath206 .",
    "note that classically , the value of the total energy is the same as the energy of the isolated main particle , even when the interaction with the environment is  switched on \" .",
    "this is a consequence of taking zero temperature for the environment .",
    "it is true that when the full system is considered , we are no longer in the state of minimum of energy , @xmath51 corresponding to an excited state .",
    "nevertheless , this initial energy can not be responsible for making the particle cross the potential barrier .",
    "the classical trajectory of a particle going over the barrier would have necessarily @xmath195 at some point . if @xmath195 the value for the total energy must be positive @xmath207 .",
    "since for the initial state implies @xmath208 , this can never happen .",
    "in other words , when the interaction is switched on , the system does  gain \" energy relatively to the new vacuum , but the height of the barrier increases by the same amount , so classical activation can not take place .",
    "note that the fact that there are no fluctuations in the environment classically at t=0 , plays a crucial role in this reasoning . even for small but finite t",
    ", the energy of the environment would go as t. by choosing t small enough , this contribution could always be made smaller than the barrier height . as a consequence , and in contrast with the high - t case , we will not be able to describe the evolution of the quantum system after classicalization by simply taking its classical exact equivalent . the quantum fluctuations present in the initial state of the environment must play a role in the `` activation '' .",
    "one should note that these fluctuations are not  vacuum fluctuations \" of the full system .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that they have such a clear effect on the evolution of the system is quite remarkable .",
    "whereas in the high - t case the quantum and classical oscillators composing the bath had identical distributions , they behave in a markedly different way as @xmath209 .",
    "the quantum nature of the environment , which could be ignored at high - t , leads in this limit to important non - negligible effects .    in terms of the master equation ,",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the bath oscillators generate non - zero @xmath42 and @xmath41 terms , making diffusive phenomena possible .",
    "this is particularly true of the anomalous diffusion coefficient @xmath42 that depends logarithmically on the cutoff @xmath44 and thus can be considerably large @xcite .",
    "diffusion effects induced by quantum fluctuations are thus responsible for exciting the particle over the potential barrier .",
    "though this process is very different from high - t thermal activation , we conjecture that it may still be interpreted in terms of a modified classical setting .",
    "the key ingredient is that the classical bath should mimic the properties of the quantum @xmath1 environment .",
    "considering the classical and quantum versions of the noise kernel @xmath210 , it is possible to show that a bath of classical oscillators with a frequency dependent temperature @xmath211 should reproduce the effects of the initial quantum state .",
    "in fact , for this choice of classical environment one obtains @xmath42 and @xmath41 terms identical to those of the @xmath1 quantum case .",
    "our main point is that after decoherence takes place , a quantum open system at @xmath1 should behave as a classical open system in contact with a classical bath whose oscillators are excited in a way that reproduces the fluctuations of the corresponding quantum environment . in order to fully understand this correspondence",
    ", one should simulate a classical system interacting with this type of generalized bath , reproducing the results of the quantum case and obtaining the same time - scales for fluctuation - induced activation @xcite .",

    "since we do not have explicit estimates of the `` activation '' time in terms of @xmath44 , it is hard to predict whether there is a regime for which decoherence happens fast enough and excitation is considerably delayed .",
    "numerical results presented in figs .",

    "is completely suppressed , with the oscillating term in ( [ fit ] ) becoming irrelevant for the fit .",
    "this suggests that @xmath220 can be taken as the threshold for the fluctuations to play the principal role in the evolution , with excitation becoming the dominant processes in the dynamics in this regime . in all cases",

    "[ prob - l2 ] .",
    "clearly , the `` activation '' process for high frequency cutoff is accompanied by a fast increase in the energy of the system .",
    "once again , the fact that the energy of the main system is considerably lower than the barrier height for low @xmath44 , supports the interpretation that quantum fluctuations are behind the excitation mechanism .",
    "= 7.6 cm    finally , we looked at how the value of @xmath223 affects the overall pattern of evolution , in the case of a cutoff @xmath213 .",
    "we found that as @xmath223 decreases , as expected , tunneling reappears and the activation time increases as shown in fig  [ t_act_gamma ] .",
    "interestingly the value of the measured tunneling time @xmath30 varies with @xmath223 .",
    "for very small values of the coupling , we obtain @xmath224 in units of tunneling time",
    ". this value increases with @xmath223 up to @xmath225 of the original tunneling time . at this point ,",
    "tunneling is suppressed and , as in the case discussed above , the oscillatory term in the fit can be ignored .",
    "this suggests renormalization effects are likely to play a role in this case , as the strength of the interaction with the environment becomes larger .",
    "also worth remarking is the fact that within the region of parameters tested , @xmath217 seems to vary as the inverse of @xmath223 .",
    "this is reminiscent of eqs .",
    "( [ tdlarge ] ) and ( [ td1 ] ) indicating once again that decoherence and activation for this type of system are closely related .",
    "overall , a very rich structure seems to emerge from the interplay of several physical mechanisms taking place simultaneously at @xmath1",
    ". a detailed numerical study of these will be the focus of a future publication .",
    "we have analyzed a simple time - independent bistable system , by following the quantum evolution of a particle initially localized at one of the minima of the potential , when coupled to an external environment at both zero and high temperatures .",
    "when isolated , the particle undergoes tunneling through the barrier . for the open system , we described the effects of dissipation and diffusion on its dynamics in terms of three main phenomena : decoherence , tunneling and thermal activation .",
    "we estimated the corresponding time - scales analytically and showed that , depending on the parameters of the system and its environment , these processes can be made to act independently on the evolution .",
    "the numerical results confirmed the analytical estimates and allowed us to illustrate the distinct properties of the three types of process involved in the evolution .",
    "for the closed system , the numerical simulations displayed all the expected features of standard quantum tunneling , with the wave packet bouncing back and forth between the two vacua , with a rate given by the estimated tunneling time @xmath30 .",
    "in the high - t regime , for an appropriate region of parameter space , the open system was shown to evolve in a fundamentally different way , with the probability for the particle to be found in the original well decaying at a much slower rate .",
    "with basis on the relevant time scales determined analytically , we explained the absence of tunneling in this case as a consequence of early time classicalization at @xmath116 . the later time evolution on the other hand , was interpreted as a result of classical thermal activation .",
    "this picture was confirmed by looking at the evolution in terms of the space - probability distribution and the wigner function .",
    "in contrast with the tunneling dynamics , the wigner function for the open system became strictly positive soon after the decoherence time , evolving classically for most of the simulation time .",
    "for late times , the properties of the wigner function were characteristic of thermal activation , with the phase - space separatrix becoming heavily populated as the particle crossed over the potential barrier .",
    "as an extra check , we evolved a similar classical system and confirmed that the concentration of probability around the separatrix at @xmath52 does signal the onset of thermal activation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the environment can , for both high and zero temperatures , be tailored so as to have tunneling before decoherence or in fact any other permutation of the three processes describing the dynamics .",
    "this can be easily seen by comparing the estimated time - scales for each process . though not shown here , we have checked numerically that all these cases are indeed possible .",
    "the evolution of the open system at zero temperature shows subtly different and , in some ways , unexpected properties .",
    "tunneling is also undoubtedly quickly suppressed , as can be seen by inspecting either the probability of the particle to remain on the original well or the evolution of its wigner function . in both cases",
    "we observe typical classical features since very early times .",
    "nevertheless , at @xmath1 , the quantum fluctuations of the environmental oscillators , absent in a purely classical evolution , lead to non - zero diffusive terms .",
    "their effect is felt primarily through the anomalous diffusion coefficient @xmath42 that can have a large magnitude .",
    "we conjecture that these non - trivial diffusion effects induced by the quantum environment are large enough to excite the particle over the potential barrier .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the case where the environment is classical forbidding any kind of activation phenomena . though the late time evolution in the presence of a quantum vacuum is in nature very different from high - t thermal activation , we suggest that it could still be interpreted in terms of a purely classical setting , if the environment oscillators are described by a particular non - thermal statistical state .",
