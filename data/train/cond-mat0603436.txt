    "since the works by janssen , shaub and schmittmann @xcite , and huse @xcite , the critical properties of statistical systems have been a subject of considerable interest in nonequilibrium physics . by using renormalization group methods and numerical calculations , respectively , they showed that there is universality and scaling behavior even at the early stage of the time evolution after quenching from high temperatures to the critical one .    the dynamic scaling relation obtained by janssen _",
    "@xcite for the _",
    "_ k__th moment of the magnetization , extended to systems of finite size @xcite , is written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the time evolution , @xmath5 is an arbitrary spatial scaling factor , @xmath6 is the reduced temperature and @xmath7 is the linear size of the lattice .",
    "the exponents @xmath8 and @xmath9 are as usually the equilibrium critical exponents associated respectively with the order parameter and the correlation length , and @xmath10 is the dynamical exponent characterizing time correlations in equilibrium .    besides to avoid the well - known problem of the `` critical slowing down '' , characteristic of the equilibrium , and to provide an alternative way to obtain the familiar set of static critical exponents and dynamic critical exponent @xmath10 , in this new universal regime a new dynamic critical exponent @xmath11 is found by following the above scaling law for the order parameter at the critical temperature ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the initial magnetization of the system .",
    "this new index , independent of the previously known exponents characterizes the so - called `` critical initial slip '' , the anomalous increase of the order parameter when the system is quenched to the critical temperature @xmath15 . in addition , a new critical exponent @xmath16 , which represents the anomalous dimension of the initial magnetization is introduced to describe the dependence of the scaling behavior on the initial conditions .",
    "this exponent is related to @xmath11 as @xmath17    as proposed by majumdar _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , another dynamic critical exponent can be obtained in the study of systems far from equilibrium . by studying the behavior of the global persistence probability @xmath0 that the order parameter has not changed its sign up to time @xmath4 , they shown that @xmath0 should behave , at the critical temperature , as @xmath18 where @xmath1 is the global persistence exponent .",
    "they also argued that , if the time evolution would be a markovian process , then the exponent @xmath1 should obey the equation @xcite @xmath19 however , as shown in several works @xcite the exponent @xmath1 is an independent critical index closely related to the non - markovian process .    in this work ,",
    "we perform short - time monte carlo simulations to explore the scaling behavior of the global persistence probability @xmath0 for the fsp model @xcite , bw model @xcite and imwtsi @xcite , that belong to the same universality class at equilibrium .",
    "we also calculate the exponent @xmath2 of these models through the eq .",
    "( [ eq : x0 ] ) .",
    "however , before calculating this exponent , we decide to reobtain more reliable estimates of the exponents @xmath11 and @xmath10 for the fsp and imtsi models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the models . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we show the short - time scaling relations and present our results .",
    "finally , in section [ section4 ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the @xmath20 state potts model which is a simple extension of the ising model , has a rich phase diagram with first order phase transitions when @xmath21 and second order phase transitions when @xmath22 .",
    "its hamiltonian is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath26 represents nearest - neighbor pairs of lattice sites , @xmath27 is the dimensionless ferromagnetic coupling constant and @xmath28 is the spin variable which takes the values @xmath29 on the lattice site @xmath30 .",
    "it is well known that the critical point of this model is given by @xcite @xmath31 and its order parameter is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath7 is the linear size of the lattice and @xmath33 is the dimension of the system .",
    "the bw model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath34 where @xmath35 are ising spin variables located at the sites of the triangular lattice and the sum is over all elementary triangles .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ising model with three - spin interactions in the horizontal direction and simple two - spin interactions in the vertical direction is given by @xmath36 where the sum is over all sites of a square lattice , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the coupling constant in the horizontal and vertical directions , respectively , and @xmath39 are ising spin variables located at the sites @xmath40 of the lattice .",
    "both bw and imtsi ( for the isotropic case , @xmath41 ) models undergo a continuous phase transition at critical temperature @xmath42 which is the same temperature as the ising model on a square lattice .",
    "the order parameter of these models is defined as , @xmath43    the bw and imtsi models present semi - global up - down spin reversal symmetry , i.e. , their hamiltonians are invariant under reversal of all the spins belonging to two of three sublattices into which the original lattice can be decomposed .",
    "the ground state of these models are fourfold degenerate , being that the possible spin configurations of the bw and imtsi models consist of repetitions of the patterns @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "the main difference between them is that the bw model is defined on a triangular lattice whereas in the fsp and imtsi models the spins are located on a square one .    from the degeneracy and symmetry considerations",
    ", one can conjecture that both models belong to the same universality class at equilibrium as the fsp model with exponents @xcite @xmath48    however , when deepenly study one these models , differences among sub - dominant exponents appear .",
    "these exponents are responsible for scale corrections , which can be related to the character of the convergence of the results obtained through the finite size scaling .",
    "these differences arised on the first time in the study of the conforme invariance .",
    "in addition , when the dynamic critical behavior of these models is take into account , the dynamic exponents found for the bw model are completely different from that values of the fsp model universality class @xcite .",
    "in our monte carlo simulations , we consider two - dimensional lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the dynamic evolution of the spins in local and updated by the heat - bath algorithm at the critical point @xmath49 . in order to check the possibility of finite - size effects , we consider three different lattice sizes , @xmath50 , 180 and 240 and",
    "the exponents were obtained from five independent bins of 20000 samples each one .",
    "the global persistence probability @xmath0 can be defined as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the fraction of the samples that have changed their state for the first time at the instant @xmath53 .",
    "the dynamical exponent @xmath1 that governs the behavior of @xmath0 at criticality is obtained through the power law behavior given by @xmath54    in order to obtain the exponent @xmath1 , the initial configuration of the system should be carefully prepared with a precise and small value of @xmath14 . after estimating @xmath1 for a number of @xmath14 values , its final value is obtained from the limit @xmath55 . in this work",
    ", we used @xmath56 .",
    "as we are consider three models and two different order parameters , it is worth to explain how obtain @xmath14 in each case . for the fsp model ,",
    "each site on the lattice is occupied by a spin variable which takes the values @xmath57 , 1 , 2 or 3 with equal probability .",
    "after , the magnetization is measured by using the eq .",
    "( [ eq : fspm ] ) and then , the variables in the sites are randomly chosen up to obtain a null value for the magnetization .",
    "the last procedure is to change @xmath58 sites on the lattice in order to obtain the initial magnetization desired . when using the eq .",
    "( [ eq : fspm ] ) , the initial magnetization is given by @xmath59 and a value of @xmath14 is obtained choosing @xmath58 sites occupied by @xmath57 , 2 or 3 and substituting them by @xmath60 . for the eq .",
    "( [ eq : bwimtsim ] ) , @xmath14 is given simply by @xmath61 and to obtain a value of @xmath14 , we choose randomly @xmath62 sites occupied by @xmath63 and substitute them by @xmath60 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta_g ] we show the behavior of the global persistence probability for @xmath64 and a small value of @xmath14 for the fsp ( on top ) , bw ( on middle ) , and imtsi ( on bottom ) models , in double - log scales .",

    ".the global persistence exponent @xmath1 from the power law behavior for the fsp , bw , and imtsi models . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     because the value of the exponent @xmath11 , the anomalous dimension of the bw model is also different of the estimates for the fsp and imtsi models . while @xmath2 is negative for the bw model , it have a null value for the fsp and imtsi models whose meaning is the presence of the marginal operator , i.e. , the operator which have the scaling dimension equal to dimensionality of the system and whose effect is not modified under renormalization - group operations .",
    "an alike value was found recently by da silva and drugowich de felcio @xcite for the fsp model . by using mixed initial conditions for the magnetization",
    ", they found @xmath67 that is in very good agreement with our results .",
    "we estimate the dynamic exponent @xmath1 of the fsp , bw and imtsi models using the time - evolution of the global persistence probability that the magnetization has not changed its sign up to time @xmath4 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 found for the bw model is completely different of that found for the fsp and imtsi models . on the other hand ,",
    "our results obtained for the fsp and imtsi models are in good agreement each other .",
    "we also reobtained the dynamic exponents @xmath11 and @xmath10 of the fsp and imtsi models in order to calculate de exponent @xmath2 .",
    "our estimates of these exponents confirm that the fsp and imtsi models belong to the same universality class far from equilibrium .",
    "following , we also calculated the exponent @xmath2 of the fsp , bw , imtsi models .",
    "our estimates of @xmath2 for the fsp and imtsi models are very closed to zero , whereas for the bw model it is very negative .",
    "these results , together the estimates of the exponents @xmath1 , @xmath11 , and @xmath10 allow us assert that , although the bw model belong to the universality class of the 4-state potts model at equilibrium , it seems not be the case far from equilibrium .",
    "these results suggest that the short time simulations get to reveal some properties that in the equilibrium stage are very difficult of note .",
