    "the discovery of the graphene - like systems and topological insulators systems introduced a new dynamic in the applications of the framework of the high energy physics in low energy systems in special condensed matter systems .",
    "the fact that these systems can be described by dirac equations give us new possibilities for theoretical and experimental applications . in this direction",
    "there are some effects in condensed matter systems still without a full description as the magnetizable systems that we described in this work . in this sense",
    "the construction of the theoretical frameworks that can , in some limit , be obtained in low energy systems is the crucial importance to understand the invariances and interactions in certain limits .",
    "one of the important effects that we can study is related with the spin systems .",
    "so , in this work we deal with the new framework to study the spin systems considering the dirac equation in non - relativistic limit with torsion interaction@xcite .",
    "spin systems are generally connected with magnetic systems .",
    "it is well known that spin angular momentum is an intrinsic property of quantum systems .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied , each material presents some level of magnetization , and quantum mechanics says that magnetization is related to the expectation value of the spin angular momentum operator . in the case of ferromagnetic materials",
    ", they can have a large magnetization even under the action of a small magnetic field and the magnetization process is always followed by hysteresis , and the magnetization is uniform and lined up with the magnetic field , usually these materials exhibit a strong ordering process that results in a parallel line up the spins@xcite . in materials graphene type we also can generate magnetic moment . in this form",
    "it is possible to study the transport phenomena @xcite .",
    "overlapping between electronic wave functions are interactions well understood , again thanks to quantum mechanics , however there are other kinds of interactions occurring such as magnetocrystalline anisotropy , connected with the temperature dependence@xcite and demagnetization fields @xcite , acting in low range . in such systems",
    "if we only consider the precession we will not reach the right limit . certainly , the precession equation has to include a damping term providing the magnetization alignment with the magnetic field after a finite time @xcite . in order to simulate these phenomena , several physical models have been presented . however , the landau - lifshitz model is still the one widely used in the description of the dynamics of ferromagnetic media . in their pioneering work @xcite in 1935 , landau and lifshitz proposed a new theory based on the following dynamical equation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 denote an effective magnetic field , with the gyromagnetic ratio absorbed , interacting with the magnetization @xmath6 .",
    "the first term is the precession of the magnetization vector around the direction of the effective magnetic field and the second one describes a damping of the dynamics . with this theory",
    "we are able to compute the thickness of walls between magnetic domains , and also understand the domain formation in ferromagnetic materials .",
    "this theory , which now goes under the name of micromagnetics , has been instrumental in the understanding and development of magnetic memories .",
    "landau and lifshitz considered the gibbs energy g of a magnetic material to be composed of three terms : exchange , anisotropy and zeeman energies ( due to the external magnetic field ) , and postulated that the observed magnetization per unit volume m field would correspond to a local minimum of the gibbs energy .",
    "later researchers added other terms to g such as magnetoelastic energy and demagnetization energy .",
    "they also derived the landau lifshitz ( ll ) equation using only physical arguments and not using the calculus of variations . in subsequent work",
    ", gilbert @xcite realized a more convincing form for the damping term , based on a variational approach , and the new combined form was then called landau lifshitz gilbert ( llg ) equation , today it is a fundamental dynamic system in applied magnetism .",
    "nowadays , the scientific and technological advances provide a wide spectrum of manipulations to the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the complete formulation for magnetization dynamics also include the excitation of magnons and their interaction with other degrees of freedom , that remains as a challenge for modern theory of magnetism @xcite .",
    "these amazing and reliable kinds of procedures are propelling spintronics as a consolidated sub - area of condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "since the experimental advances are increasingly providing high - precision data , many theoretical works are being presented @xcite and including strange materials , as the topological insulators , connected with the magnetocondutivity @xcite and graphene like structures @xcite for a deeper understanding of the phenomenon including the spin polarization super currents for spintronics @xcite , holographic understanding of spin transport phenomena @xcite and non - relativistic background @xcite .",
    "the torsion field appears as one of the most natural extensions of general relativity along with the metric tensor , which couples to the energy - momentum distribution , inspects the details of the spin density tensor .",
    "actually , in general relativity , fermions naturally couple to torsion by means of their spin .    in this work we consider that the torsion interacts with the matter in two types one of these is present in covariant derivative that contains the spin connection related with the christoffell symbol given by the metric of the curve space time and the contorsion given by the torsion that have two antisymmetric index .",
    "the other contribution is given by the non minimal spin torsion coupling that is important to the consistence of the theory .",
    "it is possible to study the non relativistic approach to the torsion in connection with the spin particles @xcite , in this work we only consider the torsion contribution considering the plane space - time .",
    "our work is organized as follows , in section 2 , we analyse the torsion coupling in relativistic limit , in section 3 the modified version of pauli equation is presented .",
    "our approach starts with a field theoretical action where a dirac fermion is non - minimally coupled in the presence of a torsion term , a low relativistic approximation is considered and the equivalent pauli equation is then obtained .",
    "we derive a very similar expression to the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation from our pauli equation with torsion . under specific conditions for the magnetic moment , we show that the llg equation can be established with damping and dislocations terms .",
    "in this section , let us understand the way to describe the spin interaction by taking into account the torsion coupling . in our framework there are two terms in dirac action ,",
    "one of these is connected with spin current effect from the spin connection , the other is a non - minimal spin torsion coupling whose effects are the subject of this work .",
    "dirac s equation is relativistic and we should justify why we use it in our model .",
    "dispersion relations in condensed matter physics ( cmp ) linear in the velocity appear in a wide class of models and one adopts the framework of dirac s equation to approach them .",
    "however , the speed of light , c , is suitably replaced by the fermi velocity , @xmath7 . here",
    ", this is not what we are doing .",
    "we actually start off from the dirac s equation and we take , to match with effects of cmp , the non - relativistic regime , for the electron moves with velocities @xmath8 .",
    "so , contrary to an analogue model where we describe the phenomena by a sort of relativity with c replaced by @xmath7 , we here consider that the non - relativistic electrons of our system is a remnant of a more fundamental relativistic world .",
    "the non - relativistic limit is also more complete because it brings effects that do not directly appear in galilean physics .",
    "this is why we have taken the viewpoint of associating our physics to the dirac s equation .      in this sub - section ,",
    "we consider the microscopic discussion that gives the explicit form of the spin current in function of the gauge potential and torsion coupling .",
    "the scenario we are setting up is justified by the following chain of arguments : ( i ) we are interested in spin effects .",
    "we assume that there is a space - time structures ( torsion ) whose coupling with the matter spin becomes relevant .",
    "but , we are actually interested in the possible non - relativistic effects stemming from this coupling , which is minimal and taken into account in the covariant derivative though the spin connection .",
    "( ii ) the other point we consider is that , amongst the three irreducible torsion components , its pseudo - vector piece is the only one that couples to the charged leptons .",
    "then , with this results in mind , we realize that the electron spin density may non - minimally couple , in a pauli- like interaction , to the field - strength of the torsion pseudo - vector degree of freedom .",
    "so , our scenario is based on the relevant role space - time torsion , here modeled by a pseudo - vector , may place in the non - relativistic electrons of spin systems in cmp .",
    "the spin current that we talk about is the spin magnetic moment and in general is not conserved alone .",
    "the quantity that is conserved is the total magnetic moment that is the composition between both @xmath9 . in form that @xmath10 where the spin current can be defined in related to the three component spin current as @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "is the spin orbit coupling . in analogy with the charge current , defined by the derivative of the action in relation to the gauge field @xmath13 we used the definition where the spin current is the derivative of the action in relation with the spin connection .",
    "we consider here the spin current as the derivative of the action in relation to the spin connection @xmath14 then the spin current is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the contorsion given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the torsion . in this work",
    "we consider two terms for torsion , on of these is the totally anti symmetric tensor , that respecting the duality relation given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the pseudo - vector part of torsion",
    ". , the afine connection is not symmetric , @xmath23 , and we can split it into three irreducible components , where one of them is the pseudo - trace @xmath24 . ] the other term that we consider is the 2-form tensor @xmath25 where @xmath26 this term is analog to the field strength of the electromagnetic gauge potential @xmath27 that in our case is changed to pseudo - vector @xmath28 . the invariant fermionic action that contained these contributions for torsion is given by @xmath29 where the covariant derivative is @xmath30 that contain the covariant gauge derivative @xmath31 and the spin connection covariant derivative .",
    "we consider the flat space - time where the only contribution for the spin connection is the contortion . in this form",
    "we have a spin current given by @xmath32 we consider the ansatz where @xmath33 contain the total antisymmetric part of the contorsion given by @xmath34 we used the splitting @xmath35 that give us the current in the form @xmath36 where the currents are @xmath37 then the current part of the action coming from the covariant derivative is given by    @xmath38    the action ( [ dirac ] ) considers the temporal component of the torsion pseudo - vector @xmath39 , we have can be written as @xmath40 our sort of gravity background does not exhibit metric fluctuations .",
    "the space - time is taken to be flat , and we propose a scenario such that the type of gravitational background is parametrized by the torsion pseudo - trace @xmath41 , whose origin may be traced back to one geometrical defect .",
    "now , we discuss the dirac equation given by eq .",
    "( [ dirac1 ] ) . from the action above , taking the variation with respect to @xmath42 , a modified dirac s equation reads as below : @xmath43\\psi=0 .",
    "\\label{dirac }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a vanishing @xmath44parameter , the equation ( [ dirac equation ] ) has been carefully studied in @xcite .",
    "the generation , manipulation , and detection of a spin current , as well as the flow of electron spins , are the main challenges in the field of spintronics , which involves the study of active control and manipulation of the spin degree of freedom in solid - state systems , @xcite .",
    "a spin current interacts with magnetization by exchanging the spin - angular momentum , enabling the direct manipulation of magnetization without using magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the interaction between spin currents and magnetization provides also a method for spin current generation from magnetization precession , which is the spin pumping @xcite .",
    "we showed in last sections that there are two type of deformations induced by the torsion .",
    "both of these can be generating a spin current .",
    "after a suitable separation of components @xmath45 , the equation of motion can be written as , @xmath46    defining a gauge - invariant momentum , @xmath47 , and using that @xmath48 with @xmath49 , the effective hamiltonian takes the form , @xmath50 where we have the matricial definitions :    @xmath51    in the heisenberg picture , the position , @xmath52 , and momentum , @xmath53 , operators obey two different kinds of relations ; we consider the torsion as a function of position only , @xmath54 , so that @xmath55 one reproduces the usual relation for @xmath56 , while the equation for @xmath57 presents a new term apparently giving some tiny correction to the lorentz force .    however , if we consider the torsion in a broader context , now as a momentum- and position - dependent background field , @xmath58 , we have to deal with the following picture , @xmath59    the two sets of dynamical equations above are clearly showing us the small corrections induced by the torsion term . nevertheless , we are still here in the relativistic domain , and it is necessary change this framework for a better understanding of the she phenomenology . for this reason , in next section we are going to approach the system by going over into its non - relativistic regimen      in this sub - section , we consider the dirac equation in its non - relativistic limit .",
    "one important requirement for the dirac equation is that it reproduces what we know from non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "we can show that , in the non - relativistic limit , two components of the dirac spinor are large and two are quite small . to make contact with the non - relativistic description , we go back to the equations written in terms of @xmath60 and @xmath61 of the four component spinor @xmath62 , just prior to the introduction of the @xmath63 matrices .",
    "we obtain two equation on of these for @xmath60 and the other for @xmath61 .",
    "we can solved in @xmath64 and substiuted in the dirac equation given by ( [ dirac1 ] ) and take the non - relativistic regimen @xmath65 .",
    "so , in this physical landscape , from now and hereafter , our goal is to consider a low - relativistic approximation based on an extended pauli equation version by including torsion as presented before . employing the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] )",
    ", we could carry out our calculations in the framework of the fouldy - wouthuysen transformations ; however for the sake of our approximation at lowest order in @xmath66 , we take that she is adequately well described by the low - relativistic pauli equation .",
    "we are considering that the electron velocities are in the range of fermi s velocity .",
    "in this case , we arrive at the version given below for the pauli s equation : @xmath67\\varphi\\ , .",
