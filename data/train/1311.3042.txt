    "the nucleus @xmath0th is located in a region where strong octupole correlations are important in the properties already of the low - lying excitations .",
    "besides the interplay of collective and single - particle excitations , which takes place in deformed rare earth nuclei , the reflection asymmetry additionally complicates the picture of excitations . already in an earlier publication @xcite",
    ", a conclusion was made that the nature of the first excited 0@xmath4 states in the actinide nuclei is different from that in the rare earth region , where they are due to the quadrupole vibration .",
    "the strong excitations in the ( p , t)-reaction suggest that these states represent a collective excitation different from the @xmath5-vibration .",
    "decay modes of the levels of the band on the first excited 0@xmath4 state in @xmath0th have led to the suggestion that this band might predominantly have an octupole two - phonon structure @xcite .",
    "one has to expect a complicated picture at higher excitations : residual interactions could mix the one - phonon and multiphonon vibrations of quadrupole and octupole character with each other and with quasiparticle excitations .",
    "detailed experimental information on the properties of such excitations is needed . on the experimental side ,",
    "two - neutron transfer reactions are very useful . on the theoretical side , a test of the advanced interacting boson model ( ibm ) and a microscopic approach , such as the quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm )",
    ", would be very interesting .",
    "after the first observation of a large number of excitations with the @xmath6 transfer in the ( p , t ) reaction seen in the odd nucleus @xmath3pa @xcite , it was logical to investigate such excitations in the even - even nucleus @xmath0th , since @xmath3pa corresponds to @xmath0th + p , as well as in other actinide nuclei .",
    "such measurements were carried out for the nuclei @xmath0th , @xmath7th and @xmath8u , and the results of a limited analysis have been published in @xcite ( besides the earlier preliminary study of @xmath0th and @xmath9u in @xcite ) .",
    "the paper @xcite concentrated only on the energies of the excited @xmath1 states in these actinide nuclei and the ( p , t ) transfer strengths to these states .",
    "the ( p , t ) reaction , however , gives much more extensive information on specific excitations in these nuclei , which was not analyzed previously .",
    "such information was obtained for @xmath7th in our paper @xcite after detailed analysis of the experimental data from the ( p , t ) reaction . for the @xmath1 excitation",
    ", we were able to derive additional information on the moments of inertia , which can be useful in clarifying the structure of these excitations . in this paper",
    "we present the results of a careful and detailed analysis of the experimental data from the high - resolution study of the @xmath7th(p , t)@xmath0th reaction carried out to obtain deeper insight into all excitations in @xmath0th .",
    "the total picture for @xmath0th has to differ from the one for @xmath7th , since the first one is considered as an octupole soft and the latter as a vibration - like nucleus",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the @xmath1 excitations in the even nucleus @xmath0th and the odd nucleus @xmath3pa , the data for which in the low - energy part of excitations are known from the publication @xcite .",
    "information on excited states of @xmath0th prior to this study was obtained mainly from the @xmath10-decay of @xmath8u , the @xmath5- and ec - decay of @xmath0ac and @xmath0pa , as well as from the ( @xmath10 , xn@xmath11)-reaction .",

    "the lowest collective bands in @xmath0th were studied in the ( @xmath10 , xn@xmath11)-reaction @xcite . a total of 58 levels were reported in @xcite and 80 levels were observed in @xcite below 2.1 mev , connected by more than 240 @xmath11-rays that were established in these studies .",
    "present results , derived from the @xmath7th(p , t)@xmath0th reaction , lead to about 163 levels in the energy range up to 3.25 mev .",
    "unfortunately , during the experiment the radioactive target was destroyed and assignments were made only for 106 levels in the range up to 2.5 mev .",
    "energies and cross sections for one angle were obtained additionally for 57 levels . besides 0@xmath4 excitations , where the number of reliable assignments could be increased for five states in comparison with the preliminary analysis in publication @xcite , information on the spins for many other states was obtained .",
    "this information was essentially complementary to what was known from publications @xcite .",
    "some levels are grouped into rotational bands , thus allowing to derive the moment of inertia for some @xmath1 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 bands .",

    "a problem arising in such calculations is the lack of prior knowledge of the microscopic structure of these states .",
    "we can assume , however , that the overall shape of the angular distribution of the cross section is rather independent of the specific structure of the individual states , since the wave function of the outgoing tritons is restricted to the nuclear exterior and therefore to the tails of the triton form factors . to verify this assumption ,",
    "dwba calculations of angular distributions for different @xmath31 transfer configurations to states with different spins were carried out in our previous paper @xcite .",

    "the maximum cross section for forward angles suggests the presence of a @xmath1 excitation , though the angular distribution fitted by a calculation for transfer of the @xmath83 configuration to the @xmath1 state is not perfect .",
    "a satisfactory fit of the experimental angular distribution was obtained assuming overlapping states with spins @xmath1 and @xmath43 ( fig .",

    "an ambiguous picture is observed for the 2335.9 kev state , where the angular distribution is measured for a limited range of angles .",
    "the fitting agreement is perfect for a transition to the 4@xmath4 state , but the cross section is surprisingly large for a 4@xmath4 state , twice larger than for the @xmath34 member of the g.s . band .",
    "therefore , the possibility of a 0@xmath4 excitation can not be excluded , but the experimental angular distribution is fitted for a @xmath1 state only with adding a constant of 14 @xmath19b .",
    "this ambiguity can be resolved by measurements in wider angular regions .",
    "thus we can make firm @xmath1 assignments for 17 states for energies excitations below 2.5 mev , in comparison with 12 states found in the preliminary analysis of the experimental data @xcite .",
    "of course , some higher lying 0@xmath4 levels are lost because of the cutoff of the investigated energy region .",
    "but as follows from a similar study for @xmath7th , only a few @xmath1 states are observed above 2500 kev , where the density of @xmath1 excitations decreases for higher energies ( or else that the cross section of such excitations is very low and they are hidden in very dense and complicated spectra ) .",

    "since we have no a priori knowledge of the microscopic structure of the excited states , and thus do not know the relative contributions of the specific @xmath31 transfer configurations to each of these states , these ratios can not be considered as spectroscopic factors .",

    "similar results are obtained for the @xmath245 state , having 2 @xmath146 bosons in their structure and which are supposed to have mainly a double - octupole phonon character ( see table  [ be_ibm ] and corresponding discussion ) . at the same time , the b(e1)/b(e2 ) ratio is considerably smaller for the decay of the @xmath247 state , which is a @xmath5-vibrational state , again in agreement with the experiment .",
    "the same result is obtained in the ibm .    generally , the qpm is quite accurate in nuclei with small ground - state correlations .",
    "these correlations increase with the collectivity of the first one - phonon states , which is exactly the case of the @xmath249 octupole phonon state in @xmath0th . to decrease the correlations the value of the octupole - octupole isoscalar interaction strength was diminished so that the calculated energy of the @xmath249 state was almost 200 kev higher than the experimental value @xcite .",
    "in addition , the effect of multi - phonon admixtures ( three and more phonons ) that pushes two - octupole phonon poles and consequently two - octupole phonon energies to lower values was then underestimated . in summary , the accuracy of the calculations of @xmath0th as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite is worse due to the increased ground - state correlations and the shift of two - phonon poles towards smaller energies . in future qpm studies",
    "one also has to take into account the spin - quadrupole interaction that is known to increase the density of low - lying @xmath1 states @xcite .      at a microscopic approach",
    "there can be a few situations of structure of the @xmath182 states .",
    "a @xmath5-vibrational mode can be characterized by the relatively small two - nucleon transfer strength and a relatively large b(e2 ) value with a moment of inertia close to the one of the ground state .",
    "the large ratio b(e1)/b(e2 ) and the increase of the moment of inertia indicate the presence of the octupole two - phonon component .",
    "if a state has a relatively weak b(e2 ) value and also a weak two - nucleon transfer strength , but exhibits an increase of the moment of inertia , it should be a state with one dominant 2qp configuration .",
    "the pairing vibrational excitations can be characterized by their large two - nucleon transfer strengths and relatively small b(e2 ) values .",
    "it is clear that the first and second @xmath1 excited states can not be the @xmath5-vibrational states as usually is observed in deformed rare - earth nuclei since their moments of inertia are much larger than those of the ground state and also their ( p , t ) strengths are large . the actual @xmath5-vibrational state is observed at 1120 kev and it is excited very weakly in the ( p , t ) reaction .",
    "as we have seen , both the ibm and the qpm reproduce the @xmath182 relative level reaction strength for the ( p , t ) reaction and the b(e1)/b(e2 ) ratios of the decay of the lowest @xmath1 states reasonably well . at the same time",
    ", the nature of @xmath1 excitations in the qpm differs significantly from the one in the _ spdf_-ibm . in all low - lying states of the qpm calculations ,",
    "quadrupole phonons are dominant and the octupole phonons are predicted to play a relatively modest role , whereas the ibm predicts the lowest @xmath1 state as having mainly 2@xmath146 bosons in their structure @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the lowest quadrupole phonon wave function in the qpm reveals that the backward rpa amplitudes @xmath250 contribute considerably to the relative ( p , t ) reaction strength thus indicating that the lowest excited @xmath1 state describe pairing vibrations arising from ground state fluctuations @xcite .    for an additional hint to the nature of the lowest @xmath1 states ,",
    "we include fig .",
    "[ fig : b(e1)-b(e2 ) ] with the b(e1)/b(e2 ) ratio stemming from the lowest excited states in @xmath0th and @xmath7th .",
    "intuitively , one would expect that a large b(e1)/b(e2 ) ratio might be characteristic for a two - octupole - phonon excitation , whereas a small ratio might indicate a shape oscillation .",
    "such a picture is observed for @xmath0th : large b(e1)/b(e2 ) ratios for the @xmath245 and @xmath246 states , and vanishing values for @xmath5- and @xmath11-vibrational states .",
    "the assumption in @xcite that just the two - phonon structure is a reason of the very strong excitation of the @xmath245 state in the ( p , t ) reaction has to be rejected , since the b(e1)/b(e2 ) ratio for the @xmath245 state in @xmath7th is small at strong excitation in the ( p , t ) reaction ( or the b(e1)/b(e2 ) ratio is no reliable manifestation of the two - phonon nature of a state ) .    .",
    "in this aspect a comparison of the relative transfer strengths in the ( p , t ) reaction leading to the @xmath1 states in @xmath0th and the @xmath251 states in @xmath3pa ( data are taken from @xcite ) has to be considered additionally ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : b(e1)-b(e2 ) ] ) .",
    "since the ground - state spin in the target nucleus @xmath252pa is @xmath251 , just these spins are excited in a two - neutron @xmath253 transfer .",
    "@xmath3pa can be regarded as @xmath0th plus a strongly coupled proton . the rotational band built on the first @xmath251 excited state in @xmath3pa at 11.6 kev @xcite corresponds to the g.s .",
    "band in @xmath0th and is excited very strongly .",
    "the main component in the structure of the ground state in the target nucleus @xmath252pa is 1/2[530 ] @xcite .",
    "therefore the levels excited in the @xmath253 transfer are @xmath254 states and they are members of collective bands based on the state originating from coupling the @xmath255 state to the @xmath0th core - excited states . such bands , as identified in @xcite , can be used to derive the moments of inertia for at least three @xmath251 states .",
    "values of @xmath256 in mev@xmath126 are given below ( energies in @xmath3pa are relative to the lowest @xmath251 state ) +    @xmath3pa : * 79.2*(0.0 kev ) , * 78.4*(703 kev ) , * 127.5*(830 kev ) + ( 1524 kev ) .",
    "+ @xmath0th : * 51.9*(0.0 kev ) , * 70.3*(832 kev ) , * 73.2*(939 kev ) . +    the moments of inertia in @xmath3pa are larger than those in @xmath0th which is a manifestation of the contribution of the odd proton",
    ". the large moment of inertia for the 830.5 kev state can probably be explained ( at least partly ) by neglecting the coriolis coupling when fitting the energies of the corresponding band .",
    "nevertheless the increment of the moment of inertia for the state at 830.5 kev relative to other states in @xmath3pa can be put in correspondence to similar increments for the states at 831.8 and 938.6 kev relative to the g.s . in @xmath0th . but this state , as well as other low - lying states in @xmath3pa , are only weakly excited in contrast to the strong excitation of the state 831.8 kev in @xmath0th . at the same time",
    ", the @xmath251 state at 1523.7 kev is excited strongly , but it can not be put in correspondence to the first excited state in @xmath0th : there is practically no increment of its moment of inertia relative to the lowest 3/2@xmath95 state .",
    "besides that , its energy is almost twice larger than the first excited @xmath1 state in @xmath0th .    from the insufficient information",
    "we can only conclude that the 831.8 kev state in @xmath0th has the largest pairing vibrational component and in @xmath3pa the additional proton has the effect that the largest pairing vibrational component is moved to the 1523.7 kev state .",
    "no theoretical explanation was undertaken since the publication of the experimental results on @xmath3pa @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to undertake the theoretical analysis of the excitations with the @xmath6 transfer in odd nuclei and first of all in the @xmath3pa nucleus .",
    "experimental study of excitations in other odd nuclei , as we have seen , may promise unexpected phenomena .",
    "as for the experimental evidence of the nature of other @xmath1 states , we have only the moments of inertia derived from the sequences of states treated as rotational bands and thus only tentative conclusions can be drawn about their structure .",
    "in contrast to @xmath7th @xcite , for which they are distributed almost uniformly over the region from 47 to 98 mev@xmath126 , the moments of inertia in @xmath0th have values close to 50 mev@xmath126 only for the g.s . , @xmath5-vibrational @xmath1 states and for the state at 1531.7 kev , all other @xmath1 states have larger values from 70 to 95 mev@xmath126 .",
    "this fact can indicate that corresponding states are possibly of two - phonon nature too , or two quasi - particle states with an admixture of the pairing vibrations .",
    "excited states in @xmath0th have been studied in ( p , t ) transfer reactions .",
    "106 levels were assigned , using a dwba fit procedure , additionally only the energies are determined for 57 states . among them , 17 excited @xmath1 states have been found in this nucleus up to an energy 2.5 mev , most of them have not been experimentally observed before .",
    "their accumulated strength makes up for more than 70% of the ground - state strength .",
    "firm assignments have been made for most of the 2@xmath4 and 4@xmath4 states and for some of the 6@xmath4 states .",
    "these assignments allowed to suggest multiplets of states , which can be treated as one- and two - phonon octupole quadruplets , and to identify the sequences of states , which have the features of rotational bands with definite inertial parameters . moments of inertia are derived from these sequences . only for the g.s . and @xmath5-vibrational states and additionally for the state at 1531.7 kev ( for which the shape of the angular distribution is different from most other ones ) , the moments of inertia are about 50 mev@xmath126 . for all other states they are larger than 70 mev@xmath126 , i.e. the value for the first excited @xmath1 state .",
    "this information , together with the spectroscopic information on some @xmath257-transitions , were used for conclusions on the nature of the @xmath1 states .",
    "the experimental data have been compared to _ spdf_-ibm and qpm calculations .",
    "spectroscopic factors from the ( p , t ) reaction , and the trend in their change with excitation energy , are approximately reproduced by both the ibm and qpm for the 0@xmath4 states .",
    "a remarkable feature of the ibm and qpm is the prediction of strong first vibrational excitations , close in magnitude and position to the experimental ones . giving also an approximately correct number of @xmath1 states ,",
