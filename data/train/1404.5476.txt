    "the problem of elastic collision between a pair of interacting particles has numerous applications , in particular to the transport properties of gases , plasmas , simulation of rarefied gas flows , etc .",
    "when classical description is sufficient and the interaction potential @xmath1 is isotropic , the problem is equivalent to the scattering of a single particle of reduced mass @xmath2 in a central force field .",
    "the scattering angle @xmath3 depends on the impact parameter @xmath4 and the kinetic energy of colliding particles , @xmath5 , as  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the reduced effective potential energy @xmath8 integration in ( [ scattering_angle ] ) is performed from the distance of the closest approach , @xmath9  the largest root of the equation @xmath10 using eqs .",
    "( [ scattering_angle])-([closestapproach ] ) , the dependence @xmath11 can be calculated ( at least numerically ) for an arbitrary pair interaction potential @xmath1 .",
    "the transport cross sections can then be obtained as proper integrals over the impact parameters .",
    "the two key quantities associated with the transport coefficients ( in the binary collision approximation ) are the diffusions ( momentum transfer ) cross section @xmath12\\rho d\\rho \\label{crossectiond}\\ ] ] and the viscosity cross section @xmath13\\rho d\\rho . \\label{crossectionv}\\ ] ] these cross sections are velocity - dependent .",
    "their names come from the fact that the diffusion and viscosity coefficients can be obtained by properly integrating these cross sections over the distribution of velocities .",
    "the diffusion and viscosity cross sections have been calculated for many potentials that are used to model interactions in real systems .",
    "perhaps , the most studied case is the conventional @xmath14 lennard - jones ( lj ) potential  @xcite of the form @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the separation between the particles , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are characteristic energy and length scales .",
    "a number of values of the cross sections along with the resulting transport integrals were tabulated ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , in particular for the high - energy regime .",
    "accurate analytical expressions for the transport cross sections can be of considerable value when searching for simplified collision models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monte carlo simulations of rarefied gas flows .",
    "in particular , this includes the so - called variable hard - sphere and variable soft - sphere models as well as their generalizations and modifications  @xcite .",
    "they can be also of practical use in other situations , an example will be given in this work .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce simple and accurate analytical expressions for the diffusion and viscosity cross sections for the lj potential , which are convenient for practical implementation . in order to do this ,",
    "the cross sections are re - evaluated numerically in a very wide range of energies .",
    "the limits of high and low energy scattering are then analyzed to identify the corresponding asymptotic behavior .",
    "it is then suggested how to modify the asymptotes in order their combination fits the numerical results with excellent accuracy ( deviations do not exceed @xmath0 ) .",
    "examples of using the proposed expressions are given towards the end of the paper .",
    "a portion of the obtained numerical results is shown in fig .  [",
    "symbols correspond to the diffusion and viscosity cross sections ( here and throughout the paper , the cross sections are in units of @xmath19 ) , plotted versus the scattering parameter @xmath20 , defined as @xmath21 from the definition ( [ beta ] ) it is clear that @xmath20 measures the relative energy of colliding particles .",
    "the high - energy collision occurs when @xmath22 , while the low - energy collision takes place when @xmath23 .",
    "note that the reduced transport cross sections depend only on @xmath20  @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath24 , respectively ) as functions of the scattering parameter @xmath20 .",
    "symbols correspond to numerical results , curves are the fits .",
    "( b ) ratio of the viscosity - to - diffusion cross sections ( @xmath25 ) as a function of @xmath20 .",
    ", width=321 ]    figure [ f1](b ) shows the ratio @xmath25 as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "this ratio is almost constant for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , but exhibits a pronounced non - monotonic behavior in the transitional regime .",
    "the present numerical results have been compared with those available in the literature .",
    "for example , table  [ tab2 ] lists the values of the diffusion cross section obtained in this work and those from ref .",
    "the maximum deviations do not exceed @xmath28 .",
    "the comparison has also been performed with the values of diffusion and viscosity cross sections tabulated in the classical paper by hirschfeleder _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "the agreement is normally better than to within @xmath29 in the high - energy regime , but becomes worse when @xmath20 approaches unity",
    ". the maximum relative deviation can be as high as @xmath30 for the diffusion cross section at @xmath31 .",
    "this observation correlates well with the earlier conclusion from ref .",
    "@xcite that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are not very accurate in the regime of moderate energies ( see figures 10 and 11 from ref .",
    "overall , the obtained numerical results are expected to have an accuracy of @xmath32 , which is more than sufficient for the main purpose of this study .",
    ".[tab2 ] diffusion ( momentum transfer ) cross section @xmath33 obtained in the present work and in ref .",
    "@xcite for several values of the scattering parameter @xmath20 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     situation becomes more complicated when deviations from the ideal gas behavior become significant . at present",
    "there is no unifying quantitative description of transport phenomena in condensed matter .",
    "methods that have been used to describe transport phenomena in liquids include for instance the enskog theory for hard sphere fluid and its modifications  @xcite , empirical fits based on the results from computer simulations  @xcite , as well as various corresponding - states relationships . among them",
    "the excess entropy scaling of the transport coefficients  @xcite can be particularly mentioned since it applies to a wide class of simple fluids , with quite different interactions .",
    "we do not elaborate on this further since the main focus here is on the weakly coupled ( gaseous ) lj systems .",
    "as another simple example , let us apply the obtained results to the problem of thermophoresis .",
    "thermophoresis describes the phenomenon wherein small particles ( or molecules ) , suspended in a gas or liquid where a temperature gradient exists ( but macroscopic flows are absent ) , drift along this temperature gradient  @xcite .",
    "the drift is normally from the side of high to the side of low temperature , but in some parameter regimes it can reverse the direction , which is then called negative thermophoresis  @xcite .    in the free molecular regime , the thermophoretic force responsible for the drift can be expressed via the momentum transfer cross section as  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the gas thermal conductivity , @xmath36 is the temperature , and @xmath37 is the gas thermal velocity ( @xmath38 when the particle is much heavier than the atoms or molecules of the gas ) .",
    "the velocity dependence of the momentum transfer cross section is a key factor , which governs the direction of the force .",
    "for relatively big spherical particles , the gas - particle collisions can be approximated as a hard sphere scattering , with the constant momentum transfer cross section ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ tp ] ) reduces to the well - known waldmann s expression  @xcite and the force pushes the particles towards low temperatures . on the other hand ,",
    "when dealing with charged particles in a plasma environment  the so - called complex ( dusty ) plasmas  @xcite the thermophoretic force can be associated not only with the neutral component  @xcite , but also with the electron and ion components . in this case , the momentum transfer is dominated by coulomb scattering and the thermal force associated with electrons and ions will normally push the particle towards the region of higher temperatures  @xcite , implying negative thermophoresis .",
    "the physical reason behind this phenomena is that the ( coulomb ) scattering momentum transfer cross section quickly decreases with velocity ( @xmath40 ) , so that the momentum transfer from the colder side turns out to be more effective",
    ".    one can easily derive simple general criterion for the negative thermophoresis .",
    "writing @xmath41 , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ tp ] ) can be evaluated explicitly to give @xmath42 it changes the sign at @xmath43 , corresponding to the switch between positive and negative thermophoresis .",
    "as the particle size decreases from micron - range to molecular scale , the model of hard sphere scattering in gas - particle collisions becomes progressively less and less accurate  @xcite .",
    "lennard - jones - type potentials may better describe gas - particle interactions in this regime .",
    "although , the conventional ( 12 - 6 ) lj potentials is likely not the best model for these interactions , we adopt it here for illustrative purposes .",
    "the numerical results plotted in fig .",
    "[ f1](a ) indicate that @xmath44 in the high energy regime and @xmath45 in the low energy regime , and according to the criterion above the conventional ( positive ) thermophoresis takes place . in the transitional regime , however , the decay of the cross section with velocity is more steep and here the negative thermophoresis can be expected  @xcite .",
    "we substitute expression ( [ diffusion ] ) into the integral in ( [ tp ] ) , perform the integration , and identify the conditions for negative thermophorersis .",
    "this results in the range @xmath46 , where negative thermophoresis occurs .",
    "these upper and lower boundaries , which are expected to be accurate to within @xmath47 , slightly improve the previous estimate from ref .",
    "@xcite , where the interval @xmath48 has been reported .",
    "to summarize , simple analytical fits for the diffusion and viscosity cross sections for elastic scattering in the lennard - jones potential are proposed .",
    "the accuracy of these fits is better than @xmath49 , which is sufficient for most practical applications .",
    "two relevant illustrations are provided . the strategy used in this work",
    "can be easily applied to other model potentials of the lennard - jones type .",
