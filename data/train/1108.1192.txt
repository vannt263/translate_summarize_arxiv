    "in recent years , the study of strongly correlated ultracold gases in optical lattices has become an important focus of experimental and theoretical research @xcite .",
    "initially , many of the efforts were devoted to studying equilibrium quantum phase transitions , for which the observation of the superfluid to mott - insulator phase transitions in three @xcite , two @xcite , and one @xcite dimension was a major experimental accomplishment .",
    "more recently , the study of the nonequilibrium dynamics of these systems has started gaining attention @xcite .",
    "the latter is possible , and offers great insights into the coherent dynamics of quantum systems , thanks to the nearly ideal isolation of the gas from the environment , and to the unique control that has been achieved experimentally over the parameters that determine the dynamics .",
    "the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum systems is a rich subject ; see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will be mainly interested in the expansion of a strongly interacting bosonic gas in the presence of an optical lattice .",
    "experimentally , expansions ( time - of - flight measurements ) have been used to learn about the properties of equilibrium gases @xcite .",
    "the idea behind those measurements is that , if the gas is allowed to expand in the absence of interactions , the initial momentum distribution function fully determines the density distribution after a long expansion time .",
    "hence , by taking a picture of the latter , one can determine the former by means of a simple rescaling @xcite .",
    "in such experiments , the particles are allowed to expand in absence of both the trapping potential and the underlying optical lattice .",
    "this implies that the kinetic energy is significantly larger than the interaction energy and , therefore , interactions can generally be neglected during the expansion . on the other hand , in the presence of the optical lattice where",
    "interactions can not be neglected during the expansion , unusual phenomena can occur @xcite , e.g. , the transformation of the momentum distribution of an expanding gas of impenetrable bosons into the momentum distribution function of a noninteracting fermi gas in equilibrium , which has a fermi edge @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been recently proposed that the expansion of two - component fermions in the presence of strong interactions in an optical lattice can be used as a tool to cool the gas through a `` quantum distillation '' process @xcite .",
    "there is another remarkable phenomenon that occurs during the expansion of a strongly interacting gas of bosons in an optical lattice , and that is the emergence of coherence during the expansion of mott - insulating states",
    ". this phenomenon will be the main focus of the present paper .",
    "a mott insulator is an interaction - generated insulator that exhibits a gap to one - particle excitations .",
    "the presence of this gap produces an exponential decay of the one - particle correlations . within the bose - hubbard model description ,",
    "the mott insulator is the ground state of lattice bosons for commensurate fillings and sufficiently strong interactions @xcite . as mentioned before ,",
    "mott insulators have been created experimentally using ultracold gases in optical lattices . due to the presence of a trapping potential",
    ", the mott insulating phases in experiments usually coexist with superfluid domains .",
    "surprisingly , when mott insulators are allowed to expand by turning off the trap in the presence of a lattice , coherence emerges between initially uncorrelated particles @xcite , a phenomenon that resembles a sort of dynamical phase transition .    the study in ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the expansion of pure mott - insulating states of hard - core bosons in one dimension ( 1d ) leads to the development of quasi - long - range correlations and to the emergence of quasi - condensates at finite momenta @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the lattice parameter ) . in a related setup",
    ", the onset of quasi - long - range correlations has been studied more recently ( in the spin-1/2 language ) using various analytic and approximate approaches @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that these results were obtained in the limit of infinite on - site repulsions between the bosons ( hard - core limit ) , and for pure mott - insulating domains .",
    "it is , therefore , natural to wonder whether the same results can be observed experimentally with ultracold gases , for which the on - site interactions are not infinite and the insulating domains are always surrounded by superfluid ones .",
    "systems containing hard - core bosons , in which superfluid and insulating domains coexist , were studied in ref .",
    "it was found there that , if most of the initial system is in a mott - insulating state , quasicondensates with momenta @xmath2 are generated .",
    "the superfluid wings surrounding the insulating domain in the initial density profiles appeared to have no negative effect on the emergence of quasicoherence during the expansion .",
    "furthermore , the expansion of a mott insulator in a system with finite on - site interactions ( soft - core bosons ) was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . once again ,",
    "quasi - long - range coherence developed during the expansion and lead to quasicondensates with momenta @xmath3 .",
    "the differences between the position of the peaks for soft - core bosons and hard - core bosons can be understood by considering their respective dispersion relations . finally , a similar onset of power - law decaying correlations has been observed during the expansion of a mott insulator within the fermionic hubbard model @xcite .",
    "a more challenging question is what happens in higher dimensions .",
    "this question poses greater conceptual and computational challenges . since hard - core bosons in 1d",
    "are described by an integrable model , one may expect their behavior to be unique .",
    "hence it may not extend to nonintegrable models far from any integrable limit , such as the bose - hubbard model with finite on - site interaction in higher dimensions . in the particular case of one spatial dimension ,",
    "since the boson s on - site interaction has to be strong enough for a mott insulator to exist , the results obtained for the 1d expansion @xcite can be thought as still affected by the infinite - repulsion integrable limit , and thus may not generalize to higher dimensions .",
    "furthermore , while the 1d expansion can be studied by means of exact analytical and/or numerical approaches in the hard - core limit @xcite and by means of an unbiased numerical technique for the soft - core case ( the time - dependent - density - matrix - renormalization - group approach @xcite ) , no such tool exists to study the expansion in higher dimensions . for the latter , no efficient and unbiased , analytical , or computational approach",
    "is known that can deal with the dynamics in the presence of strong interactions .",
    "approximations are therefore required to study these systems .",
    "a first step toward understanding what happens in higher dimensions was taken in ref .  @xcite . in that work , which was a study in the hard - core limit utilizing the gutzwiller mean - field approximation ,",
    "a three - dimensional ( 3d ) mott insulator was allowed to expand in a single direction in the lattice .",
    "the study showed that condensates emerge at finite momenta following the  melting \" of a mott insulator .",
    "in addition , the momenta of the resulting condensates were found to be fully determined by the ratio between the hopping amplitudes transverse to and along the expansion .",
    "hence these systems can be used to create highly controllable atom lasers .",
    "other nonequilibrium setups that allow one to obtain condensation at finite momentum @xcite do not seem suitable for the latter purpose .    in this paper , we extend the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite to the expansion of mott insulators with finite on - site interaction in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "our results in 2d can be straightforwardly extended to three dimensions .",
    "we first consider a setup similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which soft - core bosons are allowed to expand in a single direction .",
    "we show that similarly to the case in the hard - core limit , condensates emerge at finite momenta .",
    "we then proceed to study a system in which the mott insulator is allowed to expand in all directions of the lattice . for this particular case ,",
    "we show that , at least within the mean - field approximation , a simple condensate with many different momenta develops as the mott insulator expands .",
    "we also discuss how these results can be understood in terms of the exact dispersion relation in the hard - core limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ methods ] , we introduce the model and the time - dependent mean - field approach used to study the expansion .",
    "the explanation of how our initial states are prepared is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : inistate ] .",
    "section  [ laser ] is devoted to the study of the expansion along one direction .",
    "the case in which the mott insulator is allowed to expand in all directions is discussed in sec .",
    "[ isotropic ] .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "our study is relevant to ultracold bosons trapped in deep optical lattices .",
    "they can be well described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the boson creation ( annihilation ) operator at a given site @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the particle number operator .",
    "the first two terms of the expression are the usual kinetic and interaction terms that define the hubbard model in the homogeneous case , where @xmath9 is the hopping amplitude between neighboring sites @xmath7 and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 is the on - site interaction strength . in experiments involving ultracold gases ,",
    "a trap is required to confine the atoms . to a good approximation ,",
    "those traps are harmonic , as considered in the last term in eq .  . here ,",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the strength of the trap in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 direction , while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the coordinates of site @xmath7 with respect to the center of the trap . in the remainder of the manuscript ,",
    "positions will be given in units of the lattice spacing @xmath1 , which is taken to be the same in all directions .",
    "the ground - state phase diagram of the homogeneous case ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) has been studied extensively in all dimensions @xcite . as mentioned earlier",
    ", it contains both superfluid and mott - insulating phases .",
    "the former occurs for incommensurate fillings , and for commensurate fillings for @xmath21 is below some critical value that depends on the filling and dimensionality of the system .",
    "the insulating phases are only present for commensurate fillings and sufficiently strong interactions .",
    "this model is not exactly solvable in any dimension .",
    "unbiased results for the phase diagram have been obtained using quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , density - matrix renormalization group ( 1d ) @xcite , and strong coupling expansions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a simple approximation such as the gutzwiller mean - field theory , which is exact only in the limit of infinite dimensions , can still describe qualitatively the complete phase diagram of this model for finite dimensions @xcite .    in the presence of a trap , superfluid and mott - insulating phases",

    "the particular shape of the density distribution function can be understood within the local density approximation @xcite , given the phase diagram in the homogeneous case ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lda ] , and the accompanying explanation ) .",
    "experimentally , such a structure has been observed by several groups @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the unique opportunities provided by the study of these systems come from the experimentalist s high degree of control over the depth and structure of the optical lattice and the confining potential .",
    "essentially , all the microscopic parameters in eq .   can be manipulated and made time dependent .",
    "for example , @xmath22 , @xmath12 , and @xmath23 can be modified by changing the intensity of the laser beams that produce the lattice ; @xmath23 can be modified by introducing an additional trapping ( or antitrapping ) magnetic field ; and @xmath12 can be modified using feshbach resonances . together with the high degree of isolation from the environment",
    ", this level of control makes these experiments ideal to study the effects of strong correlations and dimensionality in the nonequilibrium dynamics of the expanding gases .    in this paper , we are interested in studying the expansion of mott - insulating states in the lattice . for this , we prepare the system in its ground state , for a particular number of particles , @xmath12 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . at time @xmath24 , we turn off the trap and allow the system to expand in the presence of the optical lattice . during the expansion ,",
    "particles interact strongly and we compute observables such as the density , momentum distribution function , and condensate fraction , as a function of time .",
    "all our calculations are performed utilizing the time - dependent gutzwiller mean - field theory .",
    "this is a good approximation in high dimensions and , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown to qualitatively reproduce the behavior seen in an exact diagonalization study of the expansion in ( small ) 2d lattices .",
    "this mean - field theory is based on the restriction that the wave function is of the gutzwiller - type product state , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of lattice sites , @xmath27 is a cutoff taken to be large enough such that all our results are independent of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 in our calculations ) , @xmath29 are the fock states for lattice site @xmath7 , and the complex coefficients @xmath30 are variational parameters determined by minimizing the expectation value @xmath31 in eq .  , @xmath32 is the chemical potential , i.e. , we work on the grand canonical ensemble , and @xmath33 the total number of particle operator .",

    "the mean - field @xmath38 is defined as @xmath39 by solving eq .",
    ", one obtains all the coefficients @xmath30 in eq .  , and hence determines the initial state for the time evolution .    an alternative approach , which is equivalent to that of solving eq .",
    ", can be used .",
    "it consists in finding the ground state of the following mean - field decoupled hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath40 this hamiltonian is obtained by a decoupling of the hopping terms in eq .   as @xmath41 equation",
    "can then be written as a sum over single - site hamiltonians @xmath42 , coupled only through constant neighboring terms @xmath38 .",
    "this implies that the ground state of the decoupled hamiltonian can be written as the product state in eq .  .",
    "the optimal set of coefficients @xmath30 is related to the ground - state eigenvector components of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "subject to the condition in eq .  , which has to be self - consistently satisfied .",
    "in practice , this condition is reached as follows : an arbitrary set of nonzero @xmath43 is used to construct a set of decoupled hamiltonians @xmath42 which are diagonalized for each site in order to obtain a set of @xmath30 s . given @xmath30 , a set of @xmath44",
    "is computed according to eq .  .",
    "if the elements on this new set are equal to those of the previous set @xmath43 within a certain desired precision , then self - consistency has been reached . if not , we set @xmath45 and construct and a new set of decoupled hamiltonians and the process of diagonalizing and finding @xmath44 is iteratively repeated until self - consistency is satisfied .",
    "we have verified that both approaches based on eq .   and",
    "eq .   provide quantitatively consistent results .",
    "however , at least within our implementations , the one based on the mean - field decoupled hamiltonian is more stable and considerably faster than the one based on the direct solution of eq .  .",
    "after turning off the trap , the time evolution of @xmath46 is computed using the time - dependent variational principle @xcite , which minimizes the expectation value , @xmath47 and leads to the following set of differential equations : @xmath48 \\\\   +",
    "n \\left[\\ , \\frac{u}{2}(n-1 ) + v_i - \\mu   \\right]\\gamma_{i n } \\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here , we use the same notation as in eq .  .",
    "it is important to note that eq .",
    "determines the time evolution while preserving the normalization of the wave function and the total number of particles @xmath49 in the system .",
    "we solve this set of @xmath50 differential equations numerically , using a fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "self - consistency is enforced by monitoring the total energy , particle number , and the normalization .",
    "we are interested in the expansion of mott - insulating states , though we know _ a priori _ that , in presence of a trapping potential , such mott states are inevitably surrounded by superfluid regions .",
    "nevertheless , one can aim at finding a setup for which those mott domains are as large as possible for a given value of @xmath51 .",
    "our approach to achieving large mott domains is based on the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the lda assumes that the local properties of the confined system can be mapped to those properties of the homogeneous system with the same value of @xmath51 and an effective chemical potential corresponding to the spatially varying @xmath52 at site @xmath7 in the trap .",
    "one can , therefore , get an approximate picture of what the trapped system looks like based on the phase diagram of the homogeneous system . within the lda , in order to get the largest mott domain , it is enough to set the chemical potential at the center of the trap to be the largest chemical potential of the homogeneous system that allows for a mott insulator with density @xmath53 .",
    "that is just the value of the chemical potential @xmath54 right at the transition from the mott insulator with density @xmath53 to the superfluid with @xmath55 .",
    "this is based on the observation that , as the distance from the center of the trap is increased , the effective chemical potential of the homogeneous system decreases . in 2d",
    ", the critical value @xmath54 can be determined within the mean - field theory by finding the largest solution for @xmath32 from the following relation that determines the boundaries of the mott lobes @xcite , @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the hopping parameters along the @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions , respectively .",
    "these ideas are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lda ] , where the mean - field phase diagram of the homogeneous 2d system is depicted [ fig .",
    "[ fig : lda](a ) ] , as well as the density profile across the center of a trapped system that contains the largest mott domain as obtained from the lda [ fig .",
    "[ fig : lda](b ) ] .",
    "we should stress that , once @xmath54 has been identified , we select a value of @xmath32 close to @xmath54 and solve eq .   and/or eq .   to obtain the initial state .",
    "hence our initial state is always the exact ground state within the mean - field approximation , i.e. , it is not the lda ground state .",
    "this is the way the initial wave function in eq .",
    "is constructed for all our expansions .",
    "let us first consider the expansion of a mott insulator along one direction in the lattice .",
    "we study the case in which the initial state is confined only along the @xmath15 direction , i.e. , @xmath59 , while @xmath13 is kept finite , but the system has open boundary conditions in the @xmath16 direction ( a box trap ) .",
    "we allow for the hopping amplitudes to be anisotropic , namely , that the hopping along the @xmath15 direction ( @xmath57 ) differs from the one along the @xmath16 direction ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we then study the expansion for several values of @xmath60 , large enough so that the mott - insulating phase exists , as well as different values of @xmath61 . in all cases considered in this section , the expansion takes place in a lattice with @xmath62 sites .",
    "as stated in the introduction , this study extends the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite on the expansion of hard - core bosons in three - dimensional lattices to the expansion of soft - core bosons confined in two - dimensional lattices .",

    "the particles are allowed to expand by switching off the confining potential along the @xmath15 direction . as a result ,",
    "the mott - insulating domains melt .",
    "this process is seen to be qualitatively similar for the two values of @xmath60 considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisodens ] . note that during the time evolution , due to the symmetry of the initial state , the system expands only along the @xmath15 direction , and the density profile maintains the reflection symmetry with respect to both @xmath15 and @xmath16 axes .",

    "[ fig : anisomom ] . at @xmath24",
    ", although barely observable in the plots ( first row in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisomom ] ) , there is a sizable population of low momentum modes , because of the presence of the inevitable superfluid regions surrounding the initial mott insulators .",
    "those modes are embedded in a roughly homogeneous background of low - populated momenta .",
    "the latter are the result of the large mott - insulating domains present in the initial states ( top panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisodens ] ) . remarkably , shortly after the expansion has started , particles get redistributed in momentum space , and they tend to fill up states surrounding two well - defined momentum values @xmath77 .",
    "this effect , which can be clearly observed in all panels with @xmath75 in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisomom ] , is already present at very early times @xmath78 .",
    "as the expansion goes on , the values of the momentum of the highly populated modes become time independent .",
    "their finite momenta reflects the motion of the two groups of particles moving away from the center of the systems in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisodens ] .",
    "we find that the structure around the momentum peaks , better seen in the left column in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisomom ] around @xmath79 , disappears as the value of @xmath60 is increased , and only sharp peaks are left .",
    "this is apparent by comparing the momentum distribution functions between @xmath80 and @xmath81 in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisodens ] .",
    "there , the peaks for @xmath65 are much sharper than those for @xmath72 .    to a very good approximation",
    ", on can predict the values of @xmath79 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisomom ] using energy and momentum conservation arguments . in order to do that",
    ", we first realize that , if @xmath60 is large enough , double or higher occupancies of the lattice sites become energetically too costly and can be , to a first approximation , ignored .",
    "the system can then be thought as composed of hard - core bosons .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the kinetic energy can then be written as @xmath82 where @xmath76 is the momentum distribution function at any given time , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the dispersion relation @xmath85 in order to further simplify the calculations , one can assume that the system before the expansion is a pure mott insulator , thus neglecting the small superfluid regions that are always present in the trap , and implying that the initial kinetic energy is @xmath86 .",
    "( note that if double occupancies are neglected , the kinetic energy is essentially the total energy of the system after the trap has been turned off . )",
    "we further recall the observation that , in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisomom ] , many particles tend to populate modes with @xmath77 , from which we understand that the @xmath16 component of @xmath79 is zero due to the symmetry of the expansion , which occurs only along the @xmath15 direction .",
    "we can now ask , within our simplified picture of the systems presented in figs .  [",
    "fig : anisodens ] and [ fig : anisomom ] , which modes [ with ( @xmath87 ) ] could be populated by all the particles after the expansion while still conserving the energy .",

    "for the two set ups mentioned before , we also presented analytical arguments to determine which momentum modes are populated during the expansion .",
    "it is important to notice that the phenomena we have observed here arise because of a subtle interplay between quantum tunneling and strong correlations .",
    "both effects play a crucial role in the generation of the condensates as , on the one hand , tunneling is necessary for the system to expand , and on the other hand , interactions are necessary for the bosons to redistribute the energy and couple coherently . in the absence of interactions ,",
    "the system still expands , but the momentum distribution remains unchanged from its initial value , i.e. , it remains featureless if one starts from purely localized particles in the lattice sites ( a fock state ) , and no condensation occurs .",
