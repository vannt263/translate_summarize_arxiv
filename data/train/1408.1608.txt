    "gamma  ray bursts ( grbs ) are transient emission episodes of radiation detected at high energies .",
    "the first emission phase , detected at hard x  rays and @xmath5rays , lasts for @xmath6  0.01 ms100 s ( prompt phase ) .",
    "then , the bulk of emitted radiation shifts to lower energies and becomes observable at longer wavelengths , from x ",
    "rays to radio , with typical duration of @xmath6  days  months ( afterglow phase ) .",
    "the observed duration of the prompt phase is characterised by the @xmath7 parameter , i.e. the time interval during which the central 90% of the counts are recorded by the detector .",
    "the distribution of @xmath7 of grbs observed by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board the compton gamma ray observatory ( _ gcro _ ) has been found to be bimodal with a separation at @xmath6  2 s in the observer frame @xcite . according to this finding",
    ", grbs are classified either as _ short _ gamma  ray burst ( sgrb ) if @xmath8  2 , or as _ long _ ones ( lgrb ) if @xmath9  2 s ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "besides , the prompt phase of sgrbs is characterised by harder spectra @xcite and smaller spectral lags between different energy bands @xcite with respect to the prompt phase of lgrbs .    for bursts with reliable redshift estimates , it has been shown that sgrbs are systematically less energetic than lgrbs , with total x and @xmath5ray emitted energies smaller by a factor @xmath6  10100 @xcite .",
    "also , the afterglows of sgrbs , when detected , are correspondingly dimmer than those of lgrbs , but similar in other respects @xcite .",
    "finally , several nearby ( @xmath10 ) long grbs have been associated with explosions of core ",
    "collapse supernovae @xcite , while there is no similar evidence for short bursts @xcite .",
    "these findings suggest that short and long grbs might originate from different progenitors ( @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , the most important difference between short and long grbs is their @xmath7 duration . a first attempt to compare the spectral properties of short and long grbs detected by _",
    "cgro_/batse showed that ( i ) the difference in hardness could be due to a harder low energy spectral index of short grbs rather than a harder peak energy and ( ii ) that the spectra of sgrbs and the first 12 s of lgrbs appear similar @xcite .",
    "these results suggested that the engine might be similar in the two classes , but the activity would last longer in the case of lgrbs @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite found that the ratio of the shortest pulse duration to the total burst duration for both short and the first 12 s of long grbs were comparable .    with the advent of the gamma burst monitor ( gbm ) on board _ fermi _ , it became possible to compare the spectral properties of large samples of short and long grbs and to compare them with those detected by _",
    "@xcite showed that long and short grbs occupy different regions in the observer frame hardness ( defined by the peak of the @xmath11 spectrum ) versus fluence , with sgrbs having smaller fluences than long events .",
    "this also suggested that the possible selection of fluence limited samples for the comparison of sgrbs and lgrbs could introduce biases .",
    "the availability of redshift estimates for long grbs allowed one to estimate their rest frame ( intrinsic ) spectral properties , and to highlight a few correlations among them ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "@xcite found that the rest frame @xmath12 peak energy ( @xmath2 ) is correlated with the total energy emitted in the 1 kev10 mev energy range ( under the hypothesis of isotropic emission , @xmath1 ) , with a slope of @xmath6  0.5 .",
    "@xcite found a correlation between @xmath2 and the isotropic peak luminosity evaluated at the flux peak over an interval of 1 s ( @xmath13 ) , with a slope of @xmath6  0.4 .",
    "the latter correlation is valid also when considering the time resolved spectral quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 of a single burst , i.e. the evolutionary tracks of grb spectra in the @xmath16@xmath3 plane align with the yonetoku relation @xcite .    with the fast slewing _",
    "swift _ satellite @xcite it became possible to localize the x  ray afterglows of short grbs , and estimate their redshifts by means of the associated host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the comparison of intrinsic spectral properties of short and long grbs have shown that short grbs are consistent with the yonetoku relation , but are significant outliers of the amati relation @xcite . however , by analyzing a sample of 7 short grbs , @xcite suggest that short grbs might follow a parallel amati relation at lower values of @xmath17 . moreover , the sgrbs follow the same three parameter correlation ( @xmath18@xmath19@xmath2 ) valid for long grbs @xcite .",
    "the isotropic luminosities are similar in both short and long grbs , but the former are less energetic than the latter by a factor similar to the ratio of their durations .",
    "when considering the time averaged spectra , short grbs have harder low  energy spectral index , but this difference vanishes when comparing the sgrbs with only the first 12 s of long grbs @xcite .    also the time resolved spectroscopy has shown that the observed peak energy tracks the flux evolution in both short and long grbs @xcite , suggesting a common physical mechanism linking these quantities .",
    "the existence of a time resolved correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath20 was also shown to hold in short grbs @xcite .",
    "this is the most compelling evidence that the @xmath14@xmath21 correlation holding in long and short grbs ( with similar slope and normalization ) hints to a common origin which could be related to the emission mechanism @xcite and that the corresponding yonetoku correlation ( holding between time integrated properties ) can not be subject to strong selection effects .",
    "an interesting hypothesis discussed in @xcite is that both short and long grbs may share a common emission process , and that the observed differences may be ascribed to the different engine lifetime of their progenitors .",
    "yet , the comparison of short and long grbs in search for possible similarities or differences should account for their possible different redshift distributions .",
    "while several lgrbs have their redshift measured , the population of short bursts still suffers from a lack of redshift measures .",
    "recent collection of small , well defined , samples of sgrbs with measured redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allowed us to compare the energetic properties of short and long events in their rest frame .",
    "the aim of this work is to further explore the similarities between short and long grbs by comparing their intrinsic ( i.e. rest frame ) spectral properties estimated on the same rest frame time scales .",
    "the average @xmath22 duration of the short grbs with reliable ( spectroscopic ) redshifts and without x  ray extended emission in the @xcite sample is 0.3 s ( 10 bursts ) .",
    "this will be our reference time scale to perform spectral analysis of the first part of long grbs , and compare the results with those of short grbs .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a @xmath23cdm cosmology with h@xmath24 = 71 km s@xmath25 mpc@xmath25 , @xmath26 = 0.27 , @xmath27 = 0.73 .",
    "since we aim to study the prompt emission spectral properties and energetic / luminosity of grbs , we need a broad energy coverage in order to determine where the peak energy is . while _",
    "swift_/bat has a limited energy range ( 15150kev ) which is not suited for grb prompt emission spectral characterization , the gbm instrument on board _ fermi _ covers almost 2 orders of magnitude in energy with the nai detectors ( 8kev1mev ) and can extend this energy range to a few tens of mev with the inclusion of the data of the bgo detectors .",
    "hence we selected all grbs observed by _",
    "fermi_/gbm up to december 2013 with a redshift estimate .",
    "this amounts to 64 long and 7 short grbs .    among the long ones we discarded :",
    "2 grbs with missing response matrix files ; 2 grbs observed with a non  standard low level threshold ; 3 grbs whose first part was missed by the gbm ; 12 grbs for which we could not constrain either the low energy spectral index or the peak energy (  [ sec - data_an ] ) .",
    "the final lgrb sample comprises 45 long bursts .    _",
    "fermi_/gbm observed 7 short grbs with known redshift . to this sample we added the sgrb flux limited sample of 12 sources with redshift discussed in (",
    "* hereafter d14 sample ) , but discarded : grb 080905a since its redshift is likely not accurate , grb 090426 and grb 100816a since their classification as short grb is debated .",
    "four grbs in the d14 sample were also in the gbm sample : for these bursts we considered the results reported in d14 .",
    "the final sgrb sample comprises 3 grb observed with _ fermi_/gbm and 9 from d14 .    the short grb sample ,",
    "although relatively small , stems from a flux limited sample of short grb with a redshift completeness of @xmath670% @xcite .",
