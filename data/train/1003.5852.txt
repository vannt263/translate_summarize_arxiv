    "according to iau resolution b2 of the xxiiird general assembly ( 1997 ) , the hipparcos catalog @xcite is the primary realisation of the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) at optical wavelengths .",
    "its first and basic extension to higher star densities and fainter limiting magnitudes is tycho-2 , based on observations of the tycho experiment onboard the esa - hipparcos satellite .",
    "the early epoch observations of tycho-2 were taken from new reductions @xcite of the observations made for the astrographic catalog and 143 other ground - based astrometric catalogs .",
    "tycho-2 contains about 2.5 million stars and is 90 percent complete down to @xmath3 = 11.5 .",
    "published the ppmx catalog of positions and proper motions of 18 million stars with limiting magnitude around 15 in a red band .",
    "the typical accuracy of the proper motions is about 2 mas / y for 4.5 million stars with first epoch in the astrographic catalog and about 10 mas / y for all other stars .",
    "very recently , the ucac3 catalog @xcite was released .",
    "ucac3 is based on a new full - sky astrometric survey made in the years 1998 to 2004 .",
    "the catalog contains some 100 million stars down to @xmath4 = 16 mag .",
    "the largest catalog in the optical regime is usno - b1.0 @xcite with more than one billion objects .",
    "however , usno - b1.0 is not in the system of icrs ; it contains relative , not absolute proper motions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a comparison of usno - b1.0 and ppmx performed in the present work yielded systematic differences ( in areas of square degrees ) of up to 15 mas / y in proper motion and up to 0.6 arcseconds in positions at epoch 2000.0 .",
    "the two micron all sky survey @xcite , 2mass , is a complete sky - survey in the j , h and k@xmath5 bands performed in the years from 1997 to 2001 .",
    "the point source catalog of about 471 million entries is also a source of accurate astrometric positions , but contains no proper motions .    for kinematical studies in the milky way",
    "a catalog of proper motions in the icrs system and with a well - defined completeness limit is indispensable .",
    "ppmx fulfills this requirement , but with only 18 million stars it is rather small .",
    "usno - b1.0 with inertial proper motions would be a big step forward .",
    "when sdss observations became available , inertial proper motions have been constructed from a combination of sdss with usno - b1.0 using sdss galaxies as reference @xcite .",
    "this is , of course , restricted to the sdss part of the sky .",
    "the fact that usno - b1.0 is not on icrs creates a problem for minor planet observers .",
    "right ascensions and declinations based on usno - b1.0 , when combined with older epoch observations on icrs may cause biases in orbit determinations of minor planets .",
    "this is of great importance for fly - by manoeuvers of interplanetary spacecraft @xcite .",
    "combining usno - b1.0 with 2mass is such an obvious idea that it is already mentioned by @xcite . in the following",
    "we first give a schematic overview of the entire procedure(section [ over ] ) , then we describe in detail the initial steps to _ coarsely _ put usno - b1.0 to the icrs ( section [ prel ] ) .",
    "this is followed by a description the combination with 2mass observations ( section [ lsqadj ] ) , the details of the construction of the system of positions and proper motions on icrs ( section [ system ] ) , and we close with an overview of the properties of the catalog ( section [ finalcat ] ) .",
    "our approach can be considered an affordable effort to put usno - b1.0 onto icrs , and improve the individual proper motions by inclusion of 2mass",
    ". a sophisticated re - reduction of all the material might deliver superior results provided that a better reference catalog were available before gaia .",
    "[ over ]    in this section we give an executice summary of all the steps that lead to the construction of the catalogue :    step 1 : reconstruction of the individual observations that went into usno - b1.0 .",

    "step 2 : identification of usno - b1.0 stars in a given  field ",

    "step 4 : attributing weights to each observation and weighted least - squares adjustment for each star .",
    "result : new positions and proper motions of each star .",
    "step 5 : the positions and proper motions of all stars with @xmath9-magnitudes between 12 and 13 from step 4 represent the preliminary system ps1 .",
    "cross - matching the stars in ps1 with ucac3 . south of -20@xmath1 declination , adding systematic differences ucac3-ps1 in proper motions on a grid with 0.25@xmath100.25 deg@xmath11 bins with a 3@xmath103 bin moving average filter .",
    "the proper motions of ps1 north of -20@xmath1 declination are left unchanged .",
    "this system is called ps2 .",
    "step 6 : cross - matching the stars in ps2 with ppmx and adding systematic differences ppmx - ps2 in proper motions on a grid with 1@xmath101 deg@xmath11 bins with a 3@xmath103 bin moving average filter .",
    "this is called ps3 and completes the proper motion system of ppmxl .",
    "step 7 : putting stars without 2mass observations onto the system ps3 .",
    "make a least - squares adjustment ( as in step 4 ) giving all 2mass observations weight zero .",
    "compare the proper motions of all stars in ps2 with the proper motions obtained in this step and add the systematic differences to a non-2mass star on a grid with 0.25@xmath100.25 deg@xmath11 bins with a 3@xmath103 bin moving average filter .",
    "step 8 : putting the system of position 2000.0 onto the icrs .",
    "cross - matching the stars in ps2 with ppmx and determine the differences in position at epoch 2000.0 . add systematic differences ppmx - ps2 in positions on a grid with 1@xmath101 deg@xmath11 bins with a 3@xmath103 bin moving average filter .",
    "proceed analogously to step 7 for the positions of non-2mass stars .",
    "[ prel ]    usno - b1.0 is an impressive piece of work .",
    "the individual positions and proper motions are derived from up to 5 original observations . for each star ,",
    "usno - b1.0 publishes not only positions for the epoch 2000.0 and proper motions , but also gives additional information that enable to re - construct all the original observations , i.e. offsets in the x - coordinate ( negative right ascension ) and the y - coordinate ( declination ) together with field and survey identifiers which allow to recover the observational epoch . for the different surveys used for the construction of usno - b1.0 see @xcite .",
    "altogether usno - b1.0 is divided into 7435 fields , and table 3 of @xcite gives the necessary information to reconstruct all the individual observations that went into usno - b1.0 .",
    "the epochs for the fields can mostly be found in http://www.nofs.navy.mil / data / fchpix/. additional epoch information was provided by dave monet .",
    "epochs and corrections for all fields contributing to ppmxl can now be found at http://vo.uni-hd.de/usnob/res/usnob/pc/form .    as astrometric reference usno - b1.0 uses spm and npm ( the lick southern and northern proper motions program ) , which has the advantage of giving a dense grid of reference stars on each field , but the disadvantage that the mean epoch of spm and npm is about 1975 . also , the mean motion between the schmidt plates of usno - b1.0 and the spm and npm was set to zero in the least - squares adjustment .",
    "given the situation above , the re - constructed individual right ascensions and declinations could not be combined immediately with 2mass , because they are on different reference systems . to overcome this ,",
    "we made the following assumption : as a dense reference catalog had been used in each field ( roughly corresponding to a schmidt plate ) , the offset of a field ( at the field epoch ) from icrs can be described to zeroth order by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , the mean deviations in right ascension and declination ( at epoch ) from a suitable reference catalog on icrs .",
    "since usno - b1.0 gives all stars from tycho-2 with their tycho-2 entries , these can not be used directly as a reference .",
    "instead , we used the stars in ppmx fainter than the tycho-2 limits and cross - identified them with usno - b1.0 .",
    "although the fainter part of ppmx is based partly on the same surveys this approach is justified because ppmx as a whole is already on icrs whereas usno - b1.0 is not .",
    "it turned out that this simple but straighforward approach yielded remarkably good results north of -20@xmath1 declination , proving that the plate reductions using spm and npm were highly successful in these areas of the sky .",
    "this completes steps 1 and 2 from the previous section .    in step 3",
    "usno - b1.0 was cross - matched with 2mass using a cone - search with radius 2 arcsec .",
    "the crossmatches were performed with in a postgresqla database using the q3c indexing scheme @xcite .",
    "double identifications are allowed ; consequences thereof are discussed in section [ properties ] . after these steps usno - b1.0 observations could be combined with the 2mass observations .",
    "the construction of the final system , however , has been deferred to after the least - squares adjustment of mean positions and proper motions .",
    "[ lsqadj ]    before entering a least - squares adjustment , individual weights @xmath12 must be attributed to the observations of a star at epoch @xmath13 ( step 4 ) .",
    "the a - priori error of unit weight @xmath14 is arbitrarily set to 1 mas .",
    "the assignment of @xmath15 is always discussible .",
    "we attributed @xmath16  mas for each individual observation from usno - b1.0 . @xcite",
    "give @xmath17  mas for an usno - b1.0 position .",
    "@xcite however , note that they found systematic offsets of up to 250  mas usno - b1.0 positions when compared with the sdss edr .",
    "our weight corresponding to @xmath16  mas is therefore a reasonable estimate .",
    "this weight has been chosen independent of the magnitude of the star .",
    "if we assume that the accuracy of individual observations in each survey in usno - b1.0 deteriorates proportionally , then the resulting proper motion itself is not affected , however the covariance matrix is . a deeper investigation of magnitude dependent effects on individual accuracies in usno - b1.0 was beyond this work .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of 2mass is 80 mas ( 1 @xmath18 ) relative to the hipparcos reference frame for @xmath19 14 , and increases to 250 mas at @xmath20 16 @xcite .",
    "we used these values for the @xmath15 of a 2mass observation .",
    "the number of observations per star for the lsq - adjustment varies from 2 ( one early and one late epoch ) to 6 ( up to 5 epochs from the usno - b1.0 and one from 2mass ) . given the notations above , we determine the resulting covariance matrix of the unknowns as    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the mean epoch , @xmath23 is the weight of the mean position , and @xmath24 is the weight of the resulting proper motion . because of the few degrees of freedom ( @xmath25 6 observations for 2 unknowns ) in each lsq - adjustment we did not determine an a posteriori error of unit weight for individual stars .",
    "hence , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the mean errors of position and proper motion per coordinate , respectively .",
    "the mean positions @xmath28 and proper motions @xmath29 for each object are computed as    @xmath30    automatic tests for unduly large scatter among the measurements ( based on the @xmath31 sum ) and automatic elimination of outliers ( based on appropriately normalised individual residuals ) were implemented .",
    "all stars having @xmath31 sums beyond a certain significance limit , but still not showing obvious outliers , were marked as `` problem cases '' and got a `` p '' flag in the catalog .",
    "[ system ]    with the coarse systematic corrections described in section [ prel ] and the least - squares solution , a _ preliminary catalog _ of positions and proper motions was constructed with only the final systematic corrections missing .",
    "[ pmsystem ]    to link a proper motion system of a sky survey ( catalog ) to the icrs , two distinct approaches are possible .",
    "either the  proper motions  of extragalactic objects are forced to vanish , this is the method adopted by @xcite or @xcite in their reduction of sdss proper motions , or , the optical representation of the icrs , the hipparcos catalog , is extended to fainter magnitudes .",
    "we chose the second alternative , as we did not try to identify point - source - like extragalactic objects in usno - b1.0 .",
    "also , at low galactic latitudes this method can hardly work .",
    "the hipparcos catalog itself is , of course , unsuited for the link because of its low spatial density and its bright stars .",
    "the next obvious choice , tycho-2 , is is unsuitable as well for reasons laid out in section [ prel ] .",
    "this leaves the fainter part of the ppmx for the construction of the link between the usno - b1.0 proper motions and the icrs .    before we come to this comparison ,",
    "let us note that the proper motion system can be checked , to a certain degree , independent of a comparison with a reference catalog .",
    "the proper motions in an inertial reference system must , except for their peculiar motions , on average only reflect the physical motions of the stars in our galaxy , i.e. the reflex of solar motion and the rotation of the galaxy .",
    "systematics parallel to the axes of right ascension or declination must not appear , nor should features be seen representing the plate lay - out of a photographic survey . in step 5 the stars in the _ preliminary catalog _ with 2mass @xmath9-magnitudes between 12 and 13 have been chosen to represent the preliminary system ( ps1 ) .",
    "doing so , we get a fair overlap with the faint stars in ppmx .",
    "the magnitudes in the visual range from usno - b1.0 are not suited , because the magnitude system is very inhomogeneous from plate to plate .",
    "[ muealps ] and [ muedelps ] show the proper motions of the ps1 in the right ascension , declination plane in bins of 0.25@xmath320.25@xmath1 averaged via a 3@xmath103 bin moving average filter .",
    "surprisingly , the proper motion system is remarkably smooth north of @xmath33 declination .",
    "only minor plate - dependent effects can be seen .",
    "this is a hint that the authors of usno - b1.0 achieved very satisfactory results in their plate reductions in this portion of the sky .",
    "however , south of -20@xmath1 declination , plate - dependent distortions of the proper motion system are obvious and need to be corrected for .    in august 2009 ,",
    "ucac3 was released .",
    "ucac3 contains some 100 million stars and therefore goes deeper than ppmx , and , in principle , could be used for the correction of ps1 . to characterise the ucac3 system ( u3s ) of proper motions we chose stars with @xmath34 from ucac3 .",
    "this is well away both from the bright tycho-2 stars and from the magnitude limit of ucac3",
    "[ muealu3s ] and [ muedelu3s ] show the proper motions of the u3s in bins of 0.25@xmath320.25@xmath1 averaged via a 3@xmath103 bin moving average filter .",
    "white pixels show areas where ucac3 ( 14 @xmath35 15 ) contains only stars without proper motions .",
    "these areas presumably largely coincide with those without first epochs in the ucac3 project .",
    "we interpreted proper motion zero and negative errors on it ( found for about 9 million stars ) as signifying null values in the corresponding columns of ucac3 .",
    "while the proper motion system is well - determined south of -20@xmath1 declination , it clearly shows unphysical effects in both coordinates north of -20@xmath1 , where pattern - dependent proper motions occur with amplitudes exceeding @xmath36 12 mas / y . according to zacharias ( 2009 , private communication )",
    "the source of the systematic effects comes from the schmidt plates used for the first - epoch positions , whereas in the south ( @xmath37 ) the plates from the spm could be used .",
    "these systematic errors in ucac3 north of @xmath38 are so large that ucac3 can not be considered to be on the icrs system , and the reader is advised to take care when using it for kinematic investigations of our galaxy .",
    "to summarize the situation , it happens that we have proper motion systems north and south of @xmath38 which do not show conspicious plate - dependent structure .",
    "this enabled us to construct an intermediate system as a combination of both , i.e the proper motions of the ps1 are left unchanged north of @xmath38 , and differences u3s - ps1 are applied south of @xmath38 on a grid with 0.25@xmath100.25 deg@xmath11 bins with a 3@xmath103 bin moving average filter .",
    "the resulting system is called ps2 .",
    "this completes step 5 .",
    "absence of plate - dependent distortions alone does not place a proper motion system onto the icrs , the link to the hipparcos system is mandatory . in step 6 , we chose ppmx as respresentative for hipparcos , and we added systematic differences ppmx - ps2 to ps2 on a grid with 1@xmath101 deg@xmath11 bins with a 3@xmath103 bin moving average filter .",
    "this lay - out was chosen to have enough ppmx stars for the link .",
    "their number varies between 1000 and 5000 , with a few areas containing only 500 stars per bin .",
    "this link completes the proper motion system of ppmxl .",
    "the resulting system ps3 is shown in figs .",
    "[ muealfinal ] and [ muedelfinal ] .",
    "the link to ppmx introduced a negative systematic in fig .",
    "[ muealfinal ] compared to fig .",
    "[ muealps ] at + 40@xmath1 declination .",
    "this depression is already inherent in tycho-2 as shown by .",
    "so far , we only discussed the proper motion system of ppmxl for stars having 2mass observations . to ensure that objects in ppmxl beyond the 2mass limits are on the same proper motion system",
    ", we made a least - squares adjustment giving weight zero to 2mass observations ( step 7 ) .",
    "then , we compared this proper motion system with ps3 and applied the resulting corrections on a grid with 0.25@xmath100.25 deg@xmath11 bins with a 3@xmath103 bin moving average filter .",
    "in other words , for the stars in ps3 we derived positions and proper motions with and without including 2mass observations and , so , corrected the stars that happen to have no 2mass observations .    it is well known that magnitude- and colour - dependent systematic errors occur in astrometric observations , be they photographic , taken with ccds or even with photoelectric meridian circles . in the case of usno - b1.0 or ppmxl they are hard to be detected , as there is no independent reference on icrs at fainter magnitudes , e.g. at `` blue '' or `` red '' magnitudes between 19 and 20 .",
    "also , these stars have kinematics different from the bright stars in solar reflex and galactic motion .",
    "so , to a certain extent is it difficult at present to distinguish between systematic errors and different kinematics .",
    "there is only one thing one can check : the plate structure of the underlying surveys _ must not _ be seen . as an example we show in fig .",
    "[ muedelfaint ] the proper motion system of ppmxl in the i - band of usno - b1.0 in magnitudes 18 @xmath39 i @xmath39 19 .",
    "we chose the i - band here as respresentative , because the i - magnitudes are more homogenous over the full sky than are the ",
    "blue  or  red  magnitudes .",
    "qualitatively the faint stars show a similar pattern as the bright ones ( 12 @xmath40 13 ) in fig .",
    "[ muedelfinal ]",
    ". however , plate dependent distortions still are not neglegible .",
    "empty areas display regions where the stars in ppmxl have no i - band observations in the range 18 @xmath39 i @xmath39 19 .",
    "we attribute this to inhomogeneities in the usno - b1.0 i - band photometry , which leads to an apparent underdensities or missing stars compared to other fields .    in conclusion ,",
    "the proper motions system at the faintest magnitudes is more uncertain than at bright ones .",
    "a remedy could come from a sophisticated new reduction of all the survey plates where care is taken to study and avoid all magnitude- and colour dependent effects .",
    "with gaia at the horizon , this effort probably is not warranted .",
    "[ possystem ]    unlike the proper motions , the positions of ppmxl at j2000.0 can only be referred to the icrs by comparison with a catalog which is on icrs . the obvious choice would be ucac3 .",
    "however , ucac3 does not publish the original observations made in the years 1998 to 2004 with the ccd camera on the usno astrograph from ctio and flagstaff . in the published catalog",
    "the positions at 2000.0 are given , which result from applying proper motions to the original positions .",
    "in the following we show that the positional system of ucac3 at 2000.0 is already corrupted by the systematically distorted proper motions even over the few years between observation and 2000.0 .",
    "indeed , this can best be seen in fig .",
    "[ pos2000 ] for the declination system . in section [ pmsystem ]",
    "we showed the ucac3 proper motions in declination ( see fig .",
    "[ muedelu3s ] ) .",
    "if we average the proper motions over right ascension and let them pass through a high - pass filter ( variations on scales larger than 10@xmath1 are suppressed ) , we get on the northern sky 0@xmath1 @xmath41 90@xmath1 a wave - like behaviour with an amplitude of more than 5 mas / y , a period of 5 degrees and phase 0 at the equator .",
    "a similar behaviour is seen on the southern hemisphere but with a much smaller amplitude of only 1 mas / y . this is illustrated in the upper left panel of fig .",

    "@xmath43    @xmath44    subtracting both equations @xmath45    note that in this magnitude range , @xmath46 essentially coincides with the 2mass declination , because 2mass has the highest weight and is almost at epoch 2000.0 .",
    "the difference @xmath47 hence gives the difference between an original 2mass position and an original ucac3 position where no proper motions ( i.e. old epochs ) are involved .",
    "both are reduced with tycho-2 , are almost coeval , and the mean difference should be zero , at least not showing 5-degree waves . also , having filtered out the large scale effects , @xmath48 is neglegibly small ( smaller than 1 mas / y , fig.[pos2000 ] upper right panel ) , so we get :    @xmath49    for @xmath50 we find that the position difference at 2000.0 is in phase with the ucac3 proper motions as long as @xmath51 , and in anti - phase otherwise",

    "the proper motions without 2mass are of poor quality , because the first epoch is much later than in the other zones , and hence the epoch difference is rather small .",
    "2mass improves the situation , but a contemporary ( 2010 ) survey such as the sky mapper southern sky survey @xcite will give a considerable improvement .",
    "ppmxl is a catalog which is nominally on the icrs system .",
    "it is linked to the hipparcos catalog , the optical representation of the icrs , via tycho-2 and ppmx .",
    "a word about the inertiality of ppmxl is therefore appropriate .",
    "the uncertainty of a residual rotation of hipparcos itself is 0.25 mas / y .",
    "this is a global quantity , on smaller scales the uncertainty is larger . on a typical field of the sky of one square degree",
    "we find about 3 faint hipparcos stars with an rms error of the proper motion of , say , 1.7 mas / y each .",
    "therefore , their `` average motion '' has a mean error of roughly 1 mas / y , a figure representative of the uncertainty of the deviation of hipparcos from a truly inertial system on a one degree scale .",
    "the actual value of such a deviation can only be determined with the results from gaia or other space missions with limiting magnitude deeper than hipparcos such as jmaps and , perhaps , nano - jasmine .",
    "also , full - sky block - adjustment procedures applied to old and new surveys can help .",
    "the two intermediate steps from hipparcos to ppmxl introduce additional systematic errors which can not be estimated rigorously .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to state that the absolute proper motions given in ppmxl have an underlying systematic uncertainty of at least 1 to 2 mas / y , which is small compared to the random error for the vast majority of ppmxl stars .",
    "the mean motion of an ensemble of stars , however , can not be determined better than the 1 to 2 mas / y mentioned above .",
    "these arguments , of course , hold similarly to tycho-2 , ppmx and the ucac series of catalogs .      [ caveats ] _ stars with @xmath55 or with p flags _ : about 146 million stars ( or 16% ) have proper motions based on 2 observations only ; and some 77 million ( or 8.4% ) carry the p flag defined in section [ lsqadj ] denoting bad @xmath31 sums of the residuals after the lsq adjustment .",
    "both cases concentrate towards the edges of plates and in dense regions of the southern sky .    _",
    "magnitude system _ : we made no attempt to recalibrate the usno b1.0 magnitude system .",
    "there are discrepancies in the magnitude system from field to field and from early to late epoch . in principle",
    ", the magnitudes can be calibrated using the guide star photometric catalog .    _",
    "double entries _ :",
    "cross - matching with 2mass has been performed using a cone of 3 arcsec radius . given the spatial resolution on the schmidt - plates underlying usno - b1.0",
    "only a single match between a 2mass and a usno - b1.0 entry should occur .",
    "however , on the northern hemisphere a single match was found in 93.6@xmath56 of all cases , on the southern hemisphere in only 88.7@xmath56 .",
    "there are also triple and multiple matches , but their number is smaller than 0.03@xmath56 north , 0.16@xmath56 south .",
    "the number of doubles and multiples strongly increases at plate boundaries and in dense regions on the southern sky ( lmc , inner galactic plane ) .",
    "no complete auto - crossmatch has been made with ppmxl , but extrapolating the matches with 2mass to the full 900 million objects , we estimate that about 90 million ( 10@xmath56 ) are false doubles or multiples from usno - b1.0 . turning the cross - match around",
    "we also found double matches of 2mass stars with an usno - b1.0 star .",
    "this amounts to 1.5@xmath56 of all cases .",
    "so , 2mass has between 6 and 7 million doubles .",
    "_  high proper motion  stars _ : there is a huge number of stars with high proper motions , e.g. on the northern hemisphere about 24.5 million objects have proper motions larger than 150 mas / y .",
    "the vast majority of them must be fakes ; a practically flat proper motion distribution function between 130 and 430 mas / y is a hint to this .",
    "also , the lspm - north catalog @xcite lists only some 61000 stars on the northern hemisphere with proper motions larger than 150 mas / y and claims to be complete to v = 19 .",
    "an attempt to solve the problem with these large proper motions ( already inherent in usno - b1.0 ) is far beyond this paper ; we only note in passing that many cases occur among the above - mentioned doubles or multiples .",
    "observers using usno - b1.0 for the reduction of their ccd frames get positions of their targets which are not on the icrs .",
    "such positions can neither be used to derive inertial stellar proper motions , nor should they be used for in orbit determinations in the case of solar system bodies . according to @xcite , there are millions of minor planet positions based on usno - b1.0 in recent years .    to aid in reducing these observations to icrs we present systematic correction tables from usno - b1.0 to ppmxl for positions at epoch 2000.0 and for proper motions .",
    "the tables give the means of the four quantities in circles of radius @xmath57 degrees around the centers of 360 by 180 spherical squares covering the sky .",
    "the application of these tables is straighforward .",
    "suppose you have an observation ( @xmath6 ) based on usno - b1.0 at epoch t ( in years ) . for this @xmath6",
    "the tables give four quantities @xmath58 in the sense ppmxl - usno - b1.0 .",
    "then the conversion to icrs is given by        the correction tables can be used or downloaded from http://vo.uni-hd.de/ppmxl . in applying these formulae",
    "note that they are not rigorous near the poles , and also that a star can cross the @xmath61 border when one applies the corrections in right ascension",
    ". we will also deliver correction tables for usno - a2.0 , ucac2 and ucac3 and 2mass on the same server .",
    "note that 2mass is an observational catalog , literally speaking with proper motions @xmath62 , observed in the years 1997 and 2001 .",
    "so , in 2010 _ systematic _ offsets may already reach 150 mas ( 15 mas / y@xmath1010 years ) .",
    "all the correction tables are created under the implicit assumption that ppmxl has no magnitude dependent systematics .",
    "this research made use of the facilities of the german astrophysical virtual observatory ( gavo ) .",
    "this publication refers to observations from the esa hipparcos satellite .",
    "it makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "we also acknowledge the institutions that funded the sky surveys on which usno - b1.0 is based upon ."
