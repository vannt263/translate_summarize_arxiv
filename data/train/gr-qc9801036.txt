    "we were very much surprised when we learned during the 8@xmath2 marcel grossmann meeting in jerusalem @xcite that kaniel & itin @xcite were able to propose a gravitational model which looks viable at a first sight even if it had neither an einstein - hilbert type of lagrangian nor the schwarzschild metric as an exact solution .",

    "let us be a bit more specific : the yilmaz - rosen metric , in isotropic coordinates , is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 . if we introduce an orthonormal coframe , @xmath8 then the following coframe , up to arbitrary local lorentz transformations , represents the yilmaz - rosen metric : @xmath9 the tracefree part of will be determined in sec .",

    "[ sec : ca ] .",
    "kaniel & itin tried to derive the field equation from a suitable lagrangian . for that purpose they had to assume specifically that the variation @xmath11 of the coframe @xmath1 commutes with the hodge star : @xmath12 .",
    "however , such a commutativity is only valid for internal yang - mills fields .",
    "it is violated for the coframe and the metric .",
    "therefore the kaniel - itin model is based on somewhat shaky foundations .    in the light of the results mentioned so far ,",
    "the following questions come to mind : ( i ) what is the source on the right hand side of the field equation ?",
    "( ii ) can the yilmaz - rosen metric also be adjusted to the trace part of and , more generally , to a possible source term on the right hand side of ? ( iii ) is there a consistent variational principle available which would allow to derive , including a source term , from a suitable lagrangian ?",
    "( iv ) what is the ( geometrical ? ) meaning of the constrained variations of kaniel & itin ?",
    "the purpose of this article is to try to answer these questions .",

    "any reasonable gauge approach to gravity contains in some way the gauging of the translation group .",
    "the simplest gauge theories of gravity are teleparallel theories with only the translation group as gauge group .",

    "accordingly , their lagrangian is a special teleparallelism lagrangian with the additional postulate of constrained variations .",
    "the commutativity of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is , in general , _ not _ fulfilled for gauge theories of _ external _ ( or spacetime ) groups , i.e. , for gravitational gauge theories . in this case",

    "6 we collect our arguments .",
    "the kinetic part of the lagrangian of a yang - mills theory is conventionally built from the first derivative of the gauge potential @xmath20 and the corresponding hodge dual . for an internal gauge group , such as for the @xmath21 or the @xmath22 , the gauge potential @xmath20 is _ independent _ of the metric @xmath18 or the coframe @xmath1 of the underlying spacetime manifold .",

    "the choice @xmath31 looks suggestive .",

    "consequently the sum of the lagrangians and , enriched by a matter lagrangian , @xmath33 would yield directly the wave equation:@xmath34 however , the lagrangian ( [ eq : lmax - dagger ] ) is not gauge - invariant : for the regauging by means of the arbitrary function @xmath35 , @xmath36 one finds - forms , see @xcite .",

    "@xmath40 accordingly , the lagrangian has to be rejected .",
    "we can obtain the wave equation only in the _ special _ gauge , _ after _ the derivation of the field equation by means of the variational principle with the lagrangian .",
    "if we used massive fields , then we would have no difficulties with lack of gauge invariance , because the mass term is not gauge invariant anyway .",
    "since we want to study gravity  la kaniel - itin , we start with a quartet of 1-form fields @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is an internal index with @xmath43 .",
    "we again derive a wave type equation as in the last subsection , but we now add a massive term for each of the four fields : @xmath44 we vary with respect to @xmath41 and find as the euler - lagrange equation : @xmath45 one could also think of an additional higgs - type ( or ` cosmological ' ) term",

    "<S> recently kaniel & itin proposed a gravitational model with the wave type equation @xmath0\\vartheta^\\alpha=0 $ ] as vacuum field equation , where @xmath1 denotes the coframe of spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> they found that the viable yilmaz - rosen metric is an exact solution of the tracefree part of their field equation . </S>",
    "<S> this model belongs to the _ teleparallelism _ class of gravitational gauge theories . </S>",
    "<S> of decisive importance for the evaluation of the kaniel - itin model is the question whether the variation of the coframe commutes with the hodge star . </S>",
    "<S> we find a master formula for this commutator and rectify some corresponding mistakes in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> then we turn to a detailed discussion of the kaniel - itin model . </S>",
