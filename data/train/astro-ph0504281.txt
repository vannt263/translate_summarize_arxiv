    "in the last decade the field of galaxy evolution has gained substantial momentum , owing to the wealth of high - quality multi - wavelength surveys from the main ground and space - based telescopes and sophisticated theoretical models .",
    "nonetheless , the current knowledge of the major physical mechanisms for galaxy formation and evolution is still affected by serious uncertainties .",
    "traditionally , star formation ( sf ) in cosmology and galaxy formation studies is naively described by simple universal laws , and the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is assumed to be constant in time and space .",
    "the only way to obtain detailed information on these crucial evolution parameters is to study the stellar populations of nearby galaxies and derive the sf history ( sfh ) over cosmological timescales .",
    "one of the fundamental tools is the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the galaxies resolved into single stars .",
    "since all the cmd features are related to the evolutionary state of the stellar populations , we can understand the sfh of a certain region within a galaxy by interpreting its cmd in terms of stellar evolution theory with the method of the synthetic cmds .",
    "in theory , from the cmd we can infer how many bursts have occurred , their duration and star formation rate ( sfr ) , and the initial mass function @xcite for any star - formation law and metallicity . in practice ,",
    "observational errors and theoretical uncertainties impose severe restrictions .",
    "the requirement of resolving a galaxy into stars limits the exploration of the sfh to nearby galaxies . at present ,",
    "even the largest telescopes only permit such studies for galaxies with distance @xmath10 15 @xmath0 20 mpc , i.e. , in the local universe . in this limited space volume",
    "we find many spirals and a plethora of both late and early dwarf galaxies .",
    "dwarf irregular galaxies ( dirrs ) and blue compact galaxies ( bcds ) play a major role in the field of galaxy evolution @xcite . with their high gas content and low metallicity , they could be similar to primeval galaxies @xcite and the best possible sites for determining the primordial @xmath11he abundance @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the excess of number counts of faint blue galaxies at redshift z @xmath12 1 may be ascribed to dwarf galaxies undergoing their first burst of sf@xcite .",
    "dwarf galaxies are important in galaxy formation models since in hierarchical models they are assumed to be the building blocks from which other types of galaxies form through merging .",
    "key questions on the evolution of late - type dwarfs are : did all the dirrs and bcds experience sf in the past ?",
    "if so , what are the properties of the sf episodes ?",
    "several stellar population studies have suggested that dirrs are characterized by a gasping ( episodes of moderate activity separated by short quiescent phases ) sf with no evidence of extended gaps @xcite .",
    "their sfr is not strong enough to explain the faint galaxy counts excess .",
    "ngc 1569 is a dirr near the local group .",
    "its intrinsic distance modulus has been estimated to be 26.71 @xmath13 0.60 @xcite , corresponding to a distance of 2.2 @xmath13 0.6 mpc .",
    "@xcite obtained a distance modulus of 27.0 @xmath13 0.5 corresponding to 2.5 @xmath13 0.5 mpc , while @xcite and @xcite found 1.8 @xmath13 0.4 mpc and @xmath12 1.7 mpc , respectively .",
    "recently , @xcite derived a new distance to ngc 1569 based on the i magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "their data are consistent with two possible distances : 1.95 @xmath13 0.2 or 2.8 @xmath13 0.2 mpc .",
    "hereafter we adopt a distance of 2.2 @xmath13 0.6 mpc @xcite , which encompasses the wide range of distances proposed in the literature .    the low galactic latitude ( b @xmath14 ) of ngc 1569 implies significant galactic reddening .",
    "@xcite estimated a value of @xmath15 for the foreground extinction using the hi column density .",
    "@xcite found a total extinction of @xmath16 from the uv color - color diagram .",
    "furthermore , many authors have suggested the existence of a strong , differential , internal reddening .",
    "@xcite found a total reddening of @xmath17 in the direction of the super star clusters ( sscs ) , where the component of the intrinsic reddening is @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite estimated the galactic extinction to be @xmath19 and the intrinsic mean extinction @xmath20 , using optical emission spectra of the ionized gas in ngc 1569 .",
    "@xcite found a variation of the total reddening in the galaxy from @xmath21 to @xmath22 with an average value @xmath23 ( with r = 3.1 ) .",
    "they found it reasonable to assume a galactic foreground of @xmath15 and ascribe the difference to the internal reddening . in @xcite ,",
    "the extinction for the area discussed in the present paper is @xmath24 , except for the sscs and hii regions .",
    "@xcite derived a foreground extinction of @xmath25 and an intrinsic reddening of @xmath26 from uv spectra .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper assume @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the mean oxygen abundance of ngc 1569 found in the literature is @xmath27 dex . with an assumed [ o / fe]@xmath28 ,",
    "the average metallicity is then 0.25 @xmath29 corresponding to @xmath30 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "this rather exceptional dwarf galaxy is known to contain two sscs , ssc - a and ssc - b , with ssc - a having two components , a1 and a2 @xcite .",
    "many hii regions are observed in those zones where sf is currently active @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , ngc 1569 is considered a `` post '' star - forming galaxy with a total dynamical mass of m@xmath32  @xmath33 m@xmath4  @xcite , one  third of which is neutral hydrogen gas ( m@xmath34 @xmath12 1.3 @xmath35 m@xmath4 , * ? ? ?",

    "there are discrete features such as arms and bridges @xcite . in the ir",
    ", @xcite found both large and very small grains exposed to a strong radiation field . @xcite found different dust properties in ngc 1569 ( most of the grains are small ) compared to other more metal rich galaxies .",
    "these results are consistent with the presence of shocks having dramatic effects on the dust . in the optical",
    ", deep @xmath37 images show filaments and arcs of warm ionized gas .",
    "these filaments have a length of several kiloparsecs with typical velocities around 50 @xmath0 100 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the highest velocities , up to 200 km s@xmath5 , have been attributed to expanding superbubbles with dynamical ages of 10 myr @xcite generated by a strong sf episode . at high energy ,",
    "x - ray observations reveal that @xmath38 of the soft x - ray emission in ngc 1569 is centered between the two sscs .",
    "its origin is attributed to thermal emission from the hot gas of a galactic superwind emanating from the disk @xcite .",
    "chandra observations find many high - mass x - ray binary systems and large inhomogeneities in the metal abundances of the interstellar medium ( ism ) with ranges from @xmath39 to @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "this is evidence that the ism has been affected by numerous supernova explosions from a recent sf episode @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite demonstrated that a galactic wind triggered only by snii explosions ( i.e. without stripping or other environmental effects ) would not be very effective in removing the ism in ngc 1569 .",
    "in fact , even if most of the metal - rich stellar ejecta can be efficiently expelled from the galaxy and dispersed in the intergalactic medium , cold and dense gas replenishes the central region of the galaxy a few hundred million years after the starburst .",
    "the sfh of ngc 1569 has most recently been studied by two groups with hubble space telescope ( hst ) data . in optical bands ( v and i ) ,",
    "@xcite found a global sf episode from 100 myr ago to 4 myr ago and hints of an older episode of sf from 1.5 gyr ago to 150 myr ago .",
    "they ruled out the existence of long quiescent phases in the last 1.5 gyr . based on b and v data , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g98 ) found a global sf episode of @xmath41 0.1 gyr duration , ending @xmath42 myr ago . during the burst ,",
    "the sfr was approximately constant , and , if quiescent periods occurred , they lasted less then @xmath12 10 myr .",
    "the derived sfr is very high and equal to 3 , 1 or 0.5 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5  for a single slope initial mass function . in this notation ,",
    "salpeter s slope is @xmath43 2.35 ] with an exponent @xmath43 3 , 2.6 or 2.35 , respectively , and a mass range from 0.1 to 120 m@xmath4 . from hst nicmos images , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter al01 ) found that young stars ( m @xmath44 m@xmath4 , age @xmath45 myr ) are more clustered around the two sscs , while the intermediate - age objects ( @xmath46 m@xmath4  @xmath10 m @xmath47 m@xmath4 , 50 myr @xmath10 age @xmath10 1 gyr ) have an almost uniform distribution , and the old stars ( m @xmath48 m@xmath4 , age @xmath49 gyr ) are located at the outskirts of the starbursting region .",
    "all these studies show that ngc 1569 experienced a strong sfr in recent epochs . with a total mass of @xmath33 m@xmath4 ,",
    "the system can not have sustained such a strong activity over a hubble time , since it would have consumed all the gas in less than 1 gyr ( g98 ) .",
    "the question then is whether the sf in ngc 1569 has started only in relatively recent epochs or has lasted for several gigayears but at much lower rates .",
    "our goal is to obtain a better understanding of the past history of this galaxy . the best way to study old stellar populations , at least in principle ,",
    "is to observe in the ir bands where the rgb phase is more evident , and where reddening effects are not as severe as in optical bands .    in this work ,",
    "we derive the sfh with the synthetic cmd method [ @xcite and g98 ] using the data of al01 in the nir filters . in section 2",
    "we summarize the data and the observed cmd . in section 3",
    "we briefly describe the cmd method and the artificial star experiment in order to derive completeness and photometric errors .",
    "the results are presented in section 4 .",
    "they are discussed and compared with the literature in section 5 .",
    "we briefly summarize the main characteristics of the observations and photometric reductions ; for further details , see al01 . the observations of ngc 1569 were performed in 1998 with the nicmos / nic2 camera on board of hst in the f110w and f160w filters .",
    "the images cover the crowded central region of the galaxy , where ssc - a , ssc - b , cluster # 30 , and part of an extended hii region complex are present .",
    "the nic2 camera has a field of view of @xmath50 , corresponding to @xmath51 pc@xmath52 at a distance of 2.2 mpc .",
    "the observations were taken with dithering .",
    "the resulting `` drizzled '' images have a point - spread function ( psf ) fwhm of 3.0 and 3.9 pixels in f110w and f160w , respectively , and a pixel size of @xmath53 , which corresponds to @xmath54 pc .",
    "the photometric reduction has been performed by al01 using daophot via psf fitting .",
    "psf - fitting photometry is not the ideal procedure for drizzled images , because drizzle creates a position - dependent psf smearing and produces correlated noise between adjacent pixels @xcite .",
    "however psf - fitting is the only viable technique in a crowded field like the central region of ngc 1569 .",
    "al01 used the deepest image ( f110w ) to locate the stars and used their coordinates to force photometry in the f160w image .",
    "this implies that all of the objects detected in the f160w image are also present in f110w but the opposite is not necessarily true .",
    "then , they selected the objects by adopting the daophot parameters @xmath55 and sharpness @xmath56 and obtained the final catalog of 3177 stars .",
    "the objects rejected by the selection criteria described above are typically the brightest objects in the sscs , smaller star clusters , extended objects , and blends .",
    "the star magnitudes were calibrated in the hst vegamag system .",
    "the cmd and luminosity function ( lf ) for ngc 1569 derived by al01 are plotted in figures  [ cmdobs ] .",
    "the limiting magnitude is m@xmath57  @xmath58 24.5 , and the color range is m@xmath57-m@xmath59  @xmath60 - 3 . to easily identify the main evolutionary phases",
    ", we plotted the padova tracks @xcite for a metallicity of z = 0.004 on the same scale ( fig .",
    "[ cmdobs ] ) .",
    "the dominant feature is the `` red plume '' extending from m@xmath57  @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "it has a small spread in color ( 0.2 mag ) and a long range in magnitude .",
    "the region corresponds to the he burning phases of stars with masses approximately from 9 to 20 m@xmath4 .",
    "the more massive stars in our catalog have masses of @xmath63 m@xmath4 , corresponding to ages of @xmath64 myr .",
    "a second feature is defined by the bulk of objects with m@xmath57  @xmath65 and m@xmath57-m@xmath59  @xmath66 where the tip of the rgb could be located .",
    "unfortunately , the rgb feature is not recognizable in the observed cmd .",
    "the tip of the rgb should be located at m@xmath57  @xmath67 for an adopted distance modulus @xmath68 and @xmath69 on the other hand , the dm uncertainty introduces an uncertainty of 0.6 mag in the location of the rgb tip ( between 21.8 and 23.0 in m@xmath57 ) . in addition , the rgb tip feature on the lf could be blurred in the cmd because the strong sf occurred at intermediate ages , as found by @xcite and in this paper ( see below ) .",
    "the derivation of the sfh from the cmd is critically dependent on the completeness and analysis of the photometric errors .",
    "this is particularly true for the oldest populations in a crowded field such as the central region of ngc 1569 , where blending of unresolved stars may severely affect our data and create spurious features in the derived cmd .",
    "it is therefore crucial to quantify these effects as well as possible by following the recipes of the data reduction , and include them in the construction of the synthetic cmds .",
    "we accounted only for the completeness of the f160w frame in our simulations because , as mentioned above , all the stars detected in f160w were previously found in f110w .",
    "however , we have performed the artificial star experiment ( ase ) in both images , since the photometric errors in both bands are required .",
    "we initially adopted the ase performed by al01 .",
    "they performed tests in which the fake stars have a psf equal to that adopted in the data reduction .",
    "then a fraction ( @xmath1210% ) of the number of detected stars was added at random positions on the image in each run and about 10 runs were performed .",
    "the total number of artificial stars was then similar to that of the detected objects .",
    "they derived an effective limiting magnitude of the data of m@xmath59  @xmath70 and a 50% completeness level at m@xmath59  @xmath71 . in the top panels of figure  [ compl ] we plot their completeness and photometric error distributions .",
    "the results obtained for m@xmath59  ( m@xmath57 ) are shown in the right ( left ) panel . in the top panels we plot the completeness factors from al01 as dashed lines , while in the middle panels we draw their estimated photometric error distributions .",
    "when we applied the ase results from al01 to the simulations , we found that they do not allow us to reproduce the faintest part of the cmd .",
    "for instance , if we simulate an old sf episode ( starting @xmath72 yr ago and still active ) with the same number of stars of the observed cmd , we obtain a synthetic diagram that underproduces the faint ( m@xmath57  @xmath41 23.5 ) tail of the lf by @xmath73 .",
    "we interpret this result as being due to an underestimate of the true completeness in the al01 ase , and we therefore performed new ase computations .",
    "we believe that this is because al01 s approach does not add a sufficient number of artificial stars at faint magnitudes , where crowding , blending and incompleteness are very severe .",
    "we therefore adopted a procedure developed by p. montegriffo at the bologna observatory @xcite , which uses @xmath74 artificial stars per band .",
    "we have put fake stars in the images according to a lf similar to the observed one . at brighter magnitudes this lf follows the observed one , but at low luminosities ,",
    "a higher number of stars is required because of the high probability of losing objects because of crowding .",
    "all the fake stars have a psf equal to that adopted in the actual data reduction . to avoid artificial crowding , we divided the frames in grids of cells of known width , and we randomly positioned only one fake star per cell at each run .",
    "we forced each star to have a distance from the cell edges large enough to guarantee that all its flux and background measuring regions fell within the cell . in this way",
    ", we could control the minimum distance between adjacent stars . at each run ,",
    "the position of the grid is randomly changed and the artificial stars are then searched in the image by using the same procedure adopted for the real data and selected with the same criteria .    an artificial star was considered lost when the difference between the input and output magnitude was larger than 0.75 .",
    "such a difference implies that the artificial star overlaps with another star of the same luminosity or brighter . in the top panels of figure  [ compl ] , the completeness derived using montegriffo s method is shown as a solid line .",
    "the photometric error distributions are plotted in the bottom panels as dots .",
    "the effective limiting magnitude of the data is m@xmath59  @xmath75 and the sample is 50% complete at m@xmath59  @xmath76 .",
    "we found _ a posteriori _ that the completeness function obtained with montegriffo s method allows us to reproduce the faint lf significantly better than with the previous ase .",
    "the input  output magnitude difference of the artificial stars provides an estimate of the photometric errors , which is safer than the error indicators of the reduction package ( @xmath77 in our case ) .",
    "the outcomes are plotted in panels [ compl]b and c for the ase approaches by al01 and montegriffo , respectively .",
    "the synthetic cmds obtained by adopting the photometric errors from the artificial star tests , usually reproduce the color and magnitude spread of the observational cmds very well [ see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] . in this case , however , by adopting the input  output magnitude difference of fig .",
    "[ compl]b as photometric error , we obtain an excessively large color spread in the sequences of the synthetic cmd .",
    "this effect is clearly evident along the red plume , where the observed cmd is tight in color .",
    "we therefore used the synthetic cmds to heuristically infer the appropriate error distribution in each filter .",
    "first , we cut the wings of the photometric error distributions at the @xmath78 level in each magnitude bin , and adopted these distributions to derive a test cmd .",
    "since in this test cmd the @xmath78 photometric error still has a color distribution larger than observed , we iterated the cutting procedure until we obtained photometric error distributions capable of reproducing the spread in the main features of the cmd .",
    "the cuts performed on the photometric error distributions eventually adopted are those shown within the solid lines in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ compl ] .",
    "we have also checked whether different portions of the image have different completeness and photometric errors . to this end , we have divided the nic2 images into three regions : the central one covering the most crowded part of the image including the sscs , and the other two towards the edges in opposite directions . no relevant deviation has been found either in the completeness factors or in the input  output magnitude difference of the three regions .",
    "many authors have found evidence of spatially variable intrinsic extinction in ngc 1569 ; this extinction increases toward the central region of the galaxy , where sscs and hii regions are located @xcite .",
    "we have divided the image in subregions and compared the corresponding color functions in order to investigate whether strong differential reddening is present in our field .",
    "no significant differences in the color distributions have been detected from the image center to the edges .",
    "we are confident that differential reddening is not an issue in our @xmath51 pc@xmath52 sized region .",
    "since the cmds of all the subregions show similar photometric errors , completenesses and color distributions , we have derived a global sfh over the whole @xmath51 pc@xmath52 image .",
    "the synthetic cmds are constructed via monte carlo extractions of ( mass , age ) pairs , according to an assumed imf , sf law , and initial and final epoch of the sf activity .",
    "each synthetic star is placed in the theoretical @xmath79 plane by suitable interpolations on the adopted evolutionary tracks ( in this case , the padova sets by * ? ? ?",
    "luminosity and effective temperature are transformed into the desired photometric system by interpolation within appropriate tables for photometric conversions [ the transformations to the vegamag system by @xcite , in this case ] , and the resulting absolute magnitude is converted to a provisional apparent magnitude by applying reddening and distance modulus .",
    "an incompleteness test on the f160w magnitudes is then performed , based on the results from montegriffo s ase .",
    "a photometric error is assigned to all the retained stars by using the `` modified distributions '' discussed in section 3.1 .",
    "the value of the sfr is obtained when the number of objects in the synthetic cmd ( or in regions corresponding to specific evolutionary phases ) is consistent with the observational data .",
    "when the examined cmd region contains only a few objects , we perform several simulations in order to avoid problems due to small number statistics . in these cases",
    ", we adopted the average value of the resulting sfrs .",
    "in order to derive the sfh of a galaxy , we explore a parameter space dependent on the distance modulus , reddening , imf , sf law , metallicity , and age of the episodes .",
    "we obtain a solution when we have a combination of parameters that generate a synthetic cmd similar to the observed one .",
    "the exploration is also limited by the intrinsic uncertainties of the theoretical models , like those introduced by the stellar evolution tracks and the photometric conversions .",
    "first , we attempt to reproduce the observed cmd with a single episode and metallicity model over the whole range of ages covered by the empirical cmd .",
    "if a single episode does not reproduce the observed cmd , we assume multiple sf events .",
    "if a single metallicity does not allow us to simulate an acceptable cmd , we try to change the metallicity for each episode .",
    "then we perform other simulations in order to check the effect on the resulting sfh by assuming different imfs , distance moduli and reddenings .",
    "this approach gives us an indication of the uncertainty on the results of our simulations .",
    "it allows us to identify the range of the parameter values leading to a satisfactory agreement with the data , and to reject those clearly inconsistent with the observational evidence . following this line of thought",
    ", we will show the simulated episodes that fit the observed data but also some of the bad episodes , because they provide hints for a better understanding of the sfh .",
    "we ran more than 1000 simulations to infer the sfh of the complicated case of ngc 1569 .",
    "we first present the results obtained by adopting @xmath68 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and a salpeter imf ( @xmath822.35 ) over the whole mass range from 0.1 to 120 m@xmath4 . in paragraph 4.3",
    "we discuss the effect of assuming different values for the imf slope , distance and reddening parameters .",
    "the models all assume a constant sfr within the specific age ranges ; we always report the sfr of each episode both in m@xmath4  yr@xmath5  kpc@xmath6  and in m@xmath4  yr@xmath5  ( the latter in brackets ) .",
    "[ bad ]      we have run several cases with a single episode of sf in ngc 1569 , all constrained to reproduce the total number of stars in the observed cmd .",
    "here we describe only three representative models : the first one ( hereafter sim1 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ bad ] ) assumes a long sf activity , commencing 5 gyr ago and still ongoing . the second model ( hereafter sim2 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ bad ] ) assumes a sf commencing only 500 myr ago and terminating 10 myr ago . the third simulation ( hereafter sim3 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ bad ] ) generates stars from 150 to 10 myr ago .",
    "sim1 has a sfr of 0.28 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5  kpc@xmath6  ( 0.01 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 ) .",
    "the simulated objects are concentrated in the lower , fainter part of the cmd ( m@xmath57  @xmath41 22.5 ) , where the low - mass stars in the rgb phase are located .",
    "the observed cmd does not show a similar concentration of objects in the faintest part .",
    "conversely , at brighter magnitudes ( m@xmath57  @xmath10 22.5 ) , the synthetic red plume shows a star deficiency with respect to the observed lf .",
    "these inconsistencies show that the bulk of the assumed sf activity is located at excessively early epochs and provides too many old stars . at the same time",
    "the synthetic cmd is populated by blue massive stars ( with m @xmath83 m@xmath4 )",
    ". a dozen of these synthetic stars are in the main - sequence phase . however , we can not clearly distinguish the main - sequence from the other evolved phases in the observed cmd because of the large photometric errors at faint magnitudes .",
    "we have also performed several simulations to overcome the small number statistics of the stars located at bright luminosity ( m@xmath57  @xmath84 ) .",
    "these simulations suggest that too many red supergiant stars are produced without observational counterparts .",
    "we can conclude that , in addition to the excess of old stars in the synthetic cmd , we also have an excess of young stars .",
    "this is the reason why in sim2 we have turned on the sf more recently and turned it off earlier ( 10 myr ago ) .",
    "sim2 has a sfr @xmath12 1.1 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5  kpc@xmath6  ( @xmath12 0.04 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 ) and fails to account for the brighter stars of the red plume .",
    "again , at faint magnitudes , sim2 shows an excess of stars . in both simulations ( sim1 and sim2 )",
    ", we have a feature in the region @xmath85 m@xmath57  @xmath86 and @xmath87 m@xmath57-m@xmath59  @xmath88 , which corresponds to stars with masses",
    "@xmath89 m@xmath4   in the agb phase and does not appear in the observed cmd .",
    "we then tried to simulate the cmd with a single episode starting @xmath90 yr ago and terminating 10 myr ago in order to avoid these stars .",
    "sim3 has a sfr of @xmath91 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5  kpc@xmath6  ( 0.07 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 ) .",
    "this simulation avoids the feature obtained in sim1 and sim2 but shows a shortage of stars at low luminosities ( m@xmath57  @xmath92 ) and at the top of the red plume ( m@xmath57  @xmath93 ) , and an excess of objects in the middle ( @xmath94 m@xmath57  @xmath95 ) of the luminosity function .    at the end of these preliminary simulations",
    ", no solution has been found that simultaneously fits both the bright and the faint parts of the cmd .",
    "hence , a single episode can not reproduce the observed cmd : to improve the fit to the data , we need to perform multiple - episode cases .",
    "[ box ]      we use the age - box procedure to investigate multiple episodes .",
    "the basic idea is that we can perform our analysis by dividing the cmd in regions ( boxes ) populated by stars with selected properties , such as age or evolutionary phase @xcite .",
    "a similar procedure is adopted by @xcite .",
    "the star counts in each box are directly linked to the mass that went into stars in the sf episodes that occurred at the corresponding epochs , i.e. the average sfr over the specific time intervals @xcite .    in order to better understand the age - box procedure , we introduce figure  [ box ] where we plot the apparent magnitude versus age of red ( m@xmath57-m@xmath59  @xmath66 ) post main sequence stars .",

    "major problems in our analysis are instead crowding , the shallow limiting magnitude and the high reddening .",
    "crowding is severe in the central region because the high recent sf activity has generated many bright , young objects that hide fainter , older ones .",
    "in addition , the shallow limiting magnitude does not allow us to reliably detect features that could help us to better determine the characteristics of the older episode .",
    "from this point of view , despite the high reddening , deeper , higher resolution hst images in optical bands could have possibly provided a better data set to study the earlier epochs .",

    "wfpc2 photometry has allowed to reach @xmath176 mag below the rgb tip in regions where nic2 barely allows the identification of the tip .    an additional uncertainty on the analysis of the central region of ngc 1569 comes from the presence of many small clusters @xcite and star - like systems .",

    "they both contain sscs , show evidence of galactic winds , and have sfrs consistent with those required by @xcite to let dwarfs account for the excess of blue galaxies at intermediate redshift .",
    "neither shows evidence of long quiescent phases in the last couple of gyrs .    at the rates derived in this paper , the central region of ngc 1569 has formed @xmath196 m@xmath4  of stars in the last 1 gyr , i.e. about @xmath197 of the total mass estimated by @xcite and about @xmath198 of the mass that is not associated with neutral hydrogen ( @xmath199 m@xmath4 ) .",
    "the field of view of nic2 corresponds to an area of 0.04 kpc@xmath52 , which covers only @xmath200 of the optical size of ngc 1569 [ 1.76 kpc@xmath52 @xcite ] .    to improve our knowledge of the sf history",
    "we have compared the integrated optical and infrared fluxes of the whole field and of the resolved stars in the nicmos area , from the images described by g98 an snd al01 .",
    "the integrated magnitudes in the hst f439w , f555w , f110w and f160w filters are 13.7 , 12.9 , 10.9 and 10 , respectively , for the field ; they are 15.2 , 14.5 , 12.1 , and 11 for the resolved stars .",
    "the dereddened m@xmath201 m@xmath59 color of our investigated region is then @xmath58 1.6 , noticeably bluer than the corresponding color for a solar kurucz model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( m@xmath202 m@xmath59)@xmath203 2.2 ) .",
    "the apparent integrated b magnitude of our nicmos field is m@xmath204 , whilst the total b magnitude of ngc  1569 is m@xmath205 @xcite .",
    "hence , our nicmos frame samples @xmath12 20% of the total b light from the galaxy , if the average reddening of the nicmos region is representative of that of the whole galaxy .",
    "notice that our sampled area is only 2.5% of the total , therefore the sf per unit area in ngc  1569 is very centrally concentrated .",
    "we can explore some possible scenarios in order to place constraints on the past history of ngc 1569 . given the total and hi masses of ngc 1569 estimated by @xcite and the astrated mass in the last 1 gyr extracted from our cmd procedure and assuming a salpeter s imf over the whole mass range , we are left with only @xmath206 m@xmath4  for the whole galaxy for the sum of the older stars and the dark matter . assuming that these old stars were produced at a constant rate over the interval @xmath207 yr ago",
    ", the corresponding sfr is @xmath208 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 .",
    "since this sfr refers to the whole galaxy , the normalized value is @xmath209 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5  kpc@xmath6 .",
    "this value is comparable to what has been derived via simulations for dwarf galaxies in the local group ( see g98 and references therein ) . for the nic area , the corresponding astrated mass over the age interval is @xmath210 m@xmath4 . if we simulate an episode that generates the @xmath211 mass over the age interval reported above , we obtain a synthetic cmd that contains @xmath212 of the total objects of the observed cmd .",
    "these synthetic stars are on the rgb .",
    "hence , in this scenario we can not rule out that a constant but low sf might have occurred over the hubble time .",
    "however , it would be very unusual for a galaxy of this type to have a dark / visible mass ratio much lower than 10 .",
    "moreover , chemical evolution models @xcite show that without the usual dark matter ratio , ngc 1569 would experience too early strong galactic winds and it would be impossible to reconcile the model predictions with the observational data .    in the second scenario ( fig . 8",
    "dashed line ) we therefore assume that the stellar component is only 10% of the dynamical mass ; then our astrated masses are probably inconsistent with a salpeter s imf extrapolated down to 0.1 m@xmath4 .",
    "however if we adopt @xcite imf , the central region has generated only @xmath213 of the stellar mass of the galaxy over the last 1 gyr .",
    "the resulting mean sfr over the interval @xmath207 yr ago is @xmath214 m@xmath4  yr@xmath5  kpc@xmath6 . alternatively , considering an onset of the sf 7 gyr ago ( i.e. , the galaxy started to form stars at redshift 1 by adopting the `` concordance cosmology '' [ @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 ) , the mean sfr is about 2 times higher than the value above .",
    "all these quantities lie in the range of sfrs typical for nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "these scenarios do not allow us to rule out a past sf with a low rate ( or similar to the typical sfr of the other dwarf galaxies ) , but we can safely conclude that the last 1 @xmath0 2 gyr have been peculiar .    what could be the cause of this peculiar sf in the last gyr ?",
    "interestingly , there is an hi cloud with mass @xmath218 m@xmath4 located at a projected distance of 5 kpc from ngc 1569 .",
    "it is connected to the galaxy by a bridge similar in mass to the hi cloud @xcite .",
    "this cloud may have triggered the star formation @xcite .",
    "moreover , according to muehle ( 2003 ) , who studied the galaxy with high - resolution hi data , the structure of the galaxy halo is the remnant of an intergalactic hi cloud in the process of merging with the galaxy .",
    "if true , this may provide both the cause and the fuel for the strong and concentrated sf activity of ngc 1569 .    to better understand the history of this intriguing object , we should try to resolve its stars older than the few gyr reached by our current data , in both the inner and outer regions .",
    "although the nir bands are important to explore old stellar population , nicmos is not an optimal instrument .",
    "the detection of the tip of the rgb ( if it exists ) will be achievable only with the hst advanced camera for surveys , which has both the necessary spatial coverage and resolution .",
