    "the superstatistics concept introduced in 2003 @xcite provides a useful tool to describe a large variety of complex systems @xcite . the basic idea is to characterize the complex system under consideration by a superposition of two statistics , one corresponding to ordinary statistical mechanics ( on a mesoscopic level modeled e.g.  by a langevin equation ) and the other one corresponding to a slowly varying parameter @xmath2 of the system which can be , but need not to be , an inverse temperature .",
    "there are many interesting applications of superstatistical techniques .",
    "recent work in this direction includes train delay statistics @xcite , the distribution of accelerations of test particles in turbulent flows @xcite and cancer survival statistics @xcite .",
    "further applications are described in @xcite .    in this paper , as a working example , we study measured statistics of wind speed fluctuations . for previous work in this direction ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we will extract the superstatistical distribution function @xmath1 out of our data set and show that in good approximation it is an inverse gamma distribution . as a theoretical model for these and other data sets , we will study langevin and fokker - planck equations with a varying , position - dependent @xmath0 .",
    "we will show that in the overdamped limit these models reduce to standard type of superstatistics .",
    "skewed stationary distributions arise naturally in these types of models if the overdamped limit is not completely performed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we recall the basic concepts of superstatistics , illustrated with the example of a linear langevin equation .",
    "in section iii we apply our methods to measured wind speed data , extracting various relevant distributions and parameters out of the data set . in section",
    "iv we extend our theoretical approach by studying a kramers - like equation with spatially varying @xmath0 .",
    "we show that this model reduces to standard type of superstatistics in the overdamped limit .",
    "an example is studied in section v. then , in section vi we comment on the skewness of the generated distributions .",
    "the last section gives a short discussion of the results of this paper .",
    "let us study as a simple example the following langevin equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constants and @xmath6 corresponds to gaussian white noise with unit variance .",
    "@xmath7 is a stochastic process that can be associated with the velocity of a brownian particle .",
    "if @xmath8 is a constant , then one ends up with the standard langevin equation which describes the dynamical process of a brownian particle with mass @xmath5 in an environment with constant temperature @xmath9 .",
    "it is well known that the stationary velocity distribution of a brownian particle is a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath9 .",
    "the relaxation time is @xmath10 . in superstatistics ,",
    "one considers a brownian particle moving through an environment with a slowly fluctuating temperature field whose changes take place on a typical time scale @xmath11 such that @xmath12 .",
    "when this inequality holds , the local velocity distribution of the system can relax to a gaussian distribution before the next change of @xmath13 takes place .",
    "as such , after a long time , the stationary velocity distribution @xmath14 of the particle is just a superposition of gaussian distributions weighted with a function @xmath1 @xmath15 this @xmath1 is the probability density to observe some value of @xmath0 .",
    "depending on the properties of @xmath1 , different results for the stationary velocity distribution @xmath14 will occur @xcite , e.g. , power - laws or stretched exponentials . in @xcite a method was introduced to determine @xmath1 , given an experimental time series .",
    "the method extracts the main superstatistical parameters out of a given data set and examines the validity of the superstatistical model assumptions . depending on the system under study",
    ", one can obtain different results for @xmath1 .",
    "we will first briefly outline this method to extract @xmath1 from the data .",
    "the starting point is a discrete time series @xmath16 containing @xmath17 data points . using the definitions proposed in @xcite , one can estimate values for the two different time scales @xmath18 and @xmath11 . in case that",
    "the inequality @xmath19 holds , one proceeds by dividing the time series @xmath16 in @xmath20 different time slices of length @xmath21 with @xmath22 , where @xmath23 means rounding the value of @xmath24 to the nearest lower integer .",
    "then , one calculates the variance of @xmath16 in each of these sub - intervals .",
    "the inverse of the variance is an estimator for the value of @xmath0 .",
    "as such , one obtains a new series containing @xmath20 points which are denoted as @xmath25 with @xmath26 . within this assumption , the distribution @xmath14 is approximated by @xmath27 when @xmath20 is large enough , one can replace expression ( [ hu_1 ] ) by ( [ super_ap ] ) with @xmath1 being the probability density that the value of the inverse variance in a randomly chosen time slice of length @xmath11 equals @xmath0 .",
    "notice that the superstatistical approach includes two approximations . in the first step",
    ", one assumes the existence of two time scales @xmath18 and @xmath11 such that in every time slice local equilibrium is reached .",
    "then , @xmath14 can be approximated by ( [ hu_1 ] ) . in the second step",
    "one assumes the existence of a distribution @xmath1 replacing the summation in expression ( [ hu_1 ] ) by an integral .",
    "then , @xmath14 can be approximated by ( [ super_ap ] ) .",
    "in the following , as a working example , we apply our method to an experimentally measured time series of the horizontal component @xmath7 of wind speeds recorded af the lammefjord site at a height of 10 m ( cup 1 ) during the year 1987 @xcite . the incremental distribution of @xmath28 exhibits non - gaussian behavior that can be modelled using superstatistics @xcite . as an illustration",
    ", we calculated the superstatistical approximation of the incremental distribution ( @xmath29 ) of the windspeeds at day @xmath30 .",
    "the measuring frequency is @xmath31hz .",
    "this means that the number of data points is @xmath32 .",
    "the two different time scales extracted from the data are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , obtained by using similar techniques as in @xcite .",
    "this illustrates that the data set shows clear time scale separation , in agreement with the results of @xcite . knowing the value of @xmath11",
    ", one can construct the distribution @xmath1 and try to approximate this histogram with some well - known distributions such as the gamma distribution , the lognormal distribution or the inverse gamma distribution .",
    "the latter one is given by @xmath35 here @xmath36 and @xmath37 are parameters . the relevance of the above three distributions was motivated in @xcite .",
    "the results of our calculations are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "there is an excellent agreement between the histogram extracted from the data and the inverse gamma distribution .",
    "the right part of the figure also shows the empirical distribution @xmath38 together with the first and second approximation of superstatistics given by eqs .",
    "( [ hu_1 ] ) and ( [ super_ap ] ) , respectively .",
    "the first approximation of superstatistics well models the fat tails of the empirical distribution @xmath38 , see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the excellent agreement between @xmath38 and expression ( [ super_ap ] ) , with @xmath1 being the inverse gamma distribution , gives further evidence that this latter distribution is well able to represent the fluctuations of @xmath0 .",
    "summarizing , our simple superstatististical model discussed so far is a good first - order approximation of the process of windspeeds increments .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the extracted time scale ratio @xmath39 as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "apparently , for small @xmath40 the time scale separation between @xmath11 and @xmath18 is less pronounced .",
    "the right part of the figure also shows a parameter @xmath41 as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "this @xmath41 was defined in @xcite as a measure of quality of the superstatistical approximation . the smaller @xmath41 , the better the superstatistical model assumptions are satisfied for the given time series .",

    "we will now generalize the langevin approach to superstatistics .",
    "we start from the following set of equations @xmath43 with @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 is a confining potential like , e.g. , a harmonic potential , and @xmath24 is a position variable .",
    "crucial for our approach is that @xmath0 depends on @xmath24 but not on the velocity @xmath16 .",
    "we are interested in the stationary velocity distribution @xmath14 .",
    "it is well known that in case @xmath46 is a constant , this distribution becomes a gaussian distribution @xmath47 however , we are interested in the general problem where the temperature is position dependent . then , in order to obtain an exact expression for @xmath14 , one has to solve the corresponding stationary fokker - planck equation for the joint distribution @xmath48 , @xmath49p(v , x)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and integrate out the dependence of the variable @xmath24 @xmath50 the problem with this procedure is that usually it is not possible to obtain an analytical expression for @xmath48 .",
    "however , in order to make the connection with the superstatistical approach outlined in the previous section , it is not necessary to have the exact form of @xmath48 .",
    "it is sufficient to study ( [ xv_lan ] ) in the high friction limit , i.e. , @xmath51 . taking this overdamped limit of ( [ xv_lan ] ) results in a stochastic differential equation in the variable @xmath52 only : @xmath53 the associated fokker - planck equation for the stationary distribution @xmath54 becomes @xmath55 ( we used ito s interpretation ) .",
    "the lower index @xmath56 is used to denote the overdamped limit .",
    "equation ( [ over_fp ] ) can be solved analytically @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a normalization constant .",
    "taking the overdamped limit physically means that the velocity will thermalise very quickly . as a consequence , for large values of @xmath4 , the solution @xmath48 of the complete fokker - planck equation ( [ full_fp ] )",
    "is approximated by @xcite @xmath59 here @xmath60 denotes the conditional distribution of @xmath16 given the local value of the slow variable @xmath24 .",
    "this is just a gaussian distribution ( [ ggg ] ) with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath61 . as a consequence ,",
    "one obtains the following approximation for the distribution of interest : @xmath62 after a change of variables , one ends up with ( [ super_ap ] ) in which the superstatistical distribution @xmath1 is associated with @xmath63 this shows that the superstatistical approximation is formally equivalent to taking the high friction limit of a stochastic differential equations of type ( [ xv_lan ] ) .",
    "the latter model describes the dynamics of a brownian particle in an inhomogeneous heat bath in the presence of a confining potential .",
    "to illustrate the theoretical considerations of the previous section , we study an explicit example here .",
    "assume for simplicity that the temperature is linear in the position @xmath24 . in order to ensure that the temperature remains positive we introduce an arbitrary small positive constant @xmath64 and define @xmath65 ^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with",
    "this choice one obtains for the velocity distribution in the overdamped limit ( [ faaa ] ) @xmath66 where we absorbed constants in the normalization @xmath58 . in the limit @xmath67",
    ", this integral simplifies to latexmath:[\\ ] ] notice that the contribution of the first order correction vanishes for @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "the third order moment becomes @xmath81 this shows that the theoretical model introduced in section iv can be used to systematically describe the experimental data .",
    "the superstatistical approximation ( the overdamped limit ) is used to model the fat tails ( the kurtosis ) of the empirical distribution . by going beyond the overdamped limit",
    ", skewness is naturally introduced in the theoretical distribution .",
    "in previous papers dealing with superstatistics , the superstatistical concept was completely probabilistic in nature .",
    "one was facing the question what the relevant temperature distributions @xmath1 are . in this paper",
    ", we have shown that the superstatistical model is equivalent to a dynamical process with a position dependent temperature field in the overdamped limit .",
    "this opens up the possibility to relate the choice of @xmath1 to a concrete question with a clear physical interpretation , namely what are appropriate choices for the potential and the temperature fields .",
    "one such example was studied in this paper . if one assumes a temperature field that is linear in the position , in combination with basically a harmonic potential , one ends up with an inverse gamma distribution for @xmath1 .",
    "this distribution is indeed observed in empirical data of wind speed fluctuations .",
    "we emphasize that other choices for temperature field and potential are of course possible .",
    "it is an interesting topic for further research to examine other physically meaningfull combinations of @xmath61 and @xmath45 .",
    "one can also try to extract the position dependence of @xmath61 and @xmath45 immediately out of empirical data , see e.g. @xcite where such analysis is performed for financial time series .",
    "finally , we showed that the theoretical approach to superstatistics presented in this paper naturally leads to skewed probability distributions if one goes beyond the overdamped limit .",
    "slightly skewed distributions are observed in several scientific fields for various variables , e.g. , wind speed fluctuations ( see section vi ) , log returns of prices in the stock market @xcite , and velocity increments of turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "apart from the observed skewness in the data , these three examples have in common that the symmetric part of the empirical distribution can be well approximated by ( [ super_ap ] ) with different expressions for @xmath1 , see , e.g. , the present paper and @xcite . in the theoretical model developed in this paper , expression ( [ super_ap ] ) is the zeroth - order approximation of the true superstatistical distribution which is obtained by fully taking into account the position dependence of @xmath61 and @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the current approach is very promising , since one can now go beyond ( [ super_ap ] ) and try to calculate successive higher - order corrections in order to describe all the essential features of an empirical distribution at hand .",
    "apart from the aforementioned examples , also dense granular flows are interesting experimental systems from a superstatistical point of view , because position dependent temperature profiles can be estimated for these kinds of systems .",
    "also , it has been shown that the particle velocity distribution shows skewness @xcite .",
