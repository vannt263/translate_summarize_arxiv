    "vacuum fluctuations are an outstanding consequence of the quantum theory of the electromagnetic radiation field , and observable manifestations of vacuum fluctuations include radiative level shifts and casimir forces @xcite .",
    "these forces are long - range interactions between neutral objects due to their interaction with vacuum fluctuations ; they are quantum effects of the radiation field and have not a classical analogue .",
    "usually casimir effect refers with this kind of interactions between macroscopic objects @xcite , and casimir - polder forces with the interactions of atoms or molecules with a macroscopic object such as a surface or among atoms and molecules @xcite .",
    "vacuum fluctuations are changed by the presence of boundary conditions given by dielectric or metallic surfaces .",
    "this change of electric and magnetic field fluctuations gives rise to energy shifts of atoms or molecules , placed near the surface , that depend from their position , yielding casimir - polder forces @xcite .",
    "evaluating field fluctuations around a boundary allows also to obtain how interactomic casimir - polder forces are modified by the presence of the boundary @xcite .",
    "these facts give further elements making relevant studying the dependence of vacuum fluctuations or vacuum energy densities on the distance from a dielectric or conducting surface .    in the case of a perfectly conducting infinite plate , the vacuum electric and magnetic fluctuations @xmath0 and @xmath1 , after subtraction of the homogeneous zero - point terms existing even in the absence of the plate ,",

    "the physical origin of this divergence and the possible presence of further singular terms at the interface has been recently questioned in the literature @xcite , and possibility of their regularizations has been investigated in the case of a scalar field using an appropriate potential to represent the wall @xcite . it has been shown that , in the case of a half - space filled with a non - dissipative dielectric material characterized by a real dielectric constant @xmath4 independent from the frequency , such divergences at the interface are still present in the limit @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "an analogous behavior has been obtained also if dispersion is introduced using the plasma model @xcite . in the case of a scalar field , it has been shown that the stress - tensor components are regularized by reflection and transmission coefficients ; also , the surface divergence associated to a perfectly reflecting mirror is canceled by a new energy density near the surface @xcite .",
    "surface divergences in the casimir energies has also been considered by introducing extra terms in the lagrangian in the form of a @xmath6-function potential , in order to simulate the boundary condition @xcite .",
    "research in this direction has been also motivated by the quest for situations where negative energy densities occur @xcite , and solving discrepancies between total self - energies and the local energy densities @xcite .",
    "the presence of surface divergences may be relevant also from the point of view of the coupling of the related field energy densities with gravity @xcite .    in this paper we shall consider electric and magnetic field fluctuations in the vacuum region near a half - space filled with a homogeneous nondissipative dielectric characterized by a real refractive index @xmath7 .",
    "the field fluctuations are evaluated using the carniglia - mandel triplets as field modes .",
    "a time - splitting procedure is used in evaluating the frequency integrals , and we notice that this is mathematically equivalent to introduce an exponential cut - off function @xmath8 , with @xmath9 playing the role of a cut - off frequency .",
    "we then consider the limit @xmath10 , leading to a model for a metallic material .",
    "if the quantity @xmath11 introduced by the time - splitting procedure is kept finite , this is representative of a situation where the contribution of field modes with @xmath12 is suppressed by the exponential cut - off .",
    "we can then consider the limit of an ideal metallic plate by taking the limit @xmath13 .",
    "after this limit , the cut - off function is one for all frequencies and we recover the nondispersive case . with this procedure",
    ", the ideal metal case is obtained through a limiting procedure , and at no point we need to use boundary conditions for ideal metals .",
    "we find that in the limit @xmath10 the renormalized field fluctuations are finite for any finite value of @xmath14 .",
    "we are also able to show that in the ideal metal limit @xmath15 surface divergences at the metal - vacuum interface emerge , and to investigate their properties . as far as we know",
    ", the structure of these surface divergences can not be derived if the field is directly quantized with a perfectly conducting boundary .",
    "moreover , no discrepancy between total self - energy and local energy densities is present in our model .",
    "such discrepancies indeed occur when energy densities are evaluated directly for the ideal metallic plate , because of the singular behavior at @xmath16 . from the field energy density we can also evaluate the electric and magnetic casimir - polder force on an atom placed near the dielectric half - space",
    ". strong radiative interactions of cesium atoms near dielectric boundaries have been recently investigated experimentally @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we calculate the vacuum fluctuations of the electric and magnetic field in the vacuum space in presence of a nondissipative homogeneous dielectric half - space .",
    "we use quantization in terms of the carniglia - mandel triplets , that include evanescent waves , and we use the known time - splitting procedure . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we consider the ideal metal case by a limit procedure from the dielectric case , and we analyze in detail the field fluctuations ( and field energy densities ) , in particular in proximity of the metal - vacuum interface .",
    "the emergence and structure of surface divergences at the interface in the ideal conductor limit is discussed in detail .",
    "we consider an half - space filled with an homogeneous dielectric medium and the vacuum in the other half - space .",
    "we label @xmath3 the direction orthogonal to the dielectric - vacuum interface : @xmath17 is the dielectric half - space and @xmath18 the vacuum half - space .",
    "our model has a translational symmetry in the x - y directions .",
    "we assume that the dielectric is non - dissipative with a ( real ) dielectric constant independent on the frequency .",
    "we shall later discuss how to introduce in our model a dependence on the frequency , in particular when considering the limit for an ideal conductor .",
    "first step is the calculation of the square of the electric and magnetic fields in the vacuum half - space ( @xmath18 ) in the ground state of the field .",
    "we use the well - known quantization scheme in terms of the carniglia - mandel triplets @xcite .",
    "the carniglia - mandel modes are given by the following expressions    [ tripletticm ] @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22    where the index @xmath23 indicates waves propagating toward the dielectric - vacuum interface from left or right , respectively , and @xmath24 specifies transverse electric ( te ) modes and @xmath25 transverse magnetic ( tm ) modes .",

    "thus we obtain    @xmath72    and @xmath73    from the expressions above , it is evident that the time - splitting procedure introduces an exponential cut - off in the frequency integrals , suppressing contributions of modes with frequency @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath14 in kept finite , the renormalized field fluctuations and are finite for any @xmath3 , including at the interface @xmath16 , due to the regularization introduced by the cut - off function .",
    "also , the electric and magnetic parts are opposite each other in all points and for any value of @xmath62 .",
    "if we take @xmath75 , we get a divergence at the conductor - vacuum interface @xmath16 : in this case , a cut - off function such as that given by the plasma model for a real conductor ( assumed valid also at very high frequecies ) , that introduces a @xmath76 factor for frequencies larger than the conductor plasma frequency , would not be enough to avoid the divergence at the interface , as showed in @xcite .",
    "there is however some controversy in the literature about which model of a real conductor ( plasma , drude or other ) should be used for calculating casimir energies and the casimir force between real materials .",
    "an explicit evaluation of the integrals in , , yields : @xmath77 for the vacuum case ; @xmath78 for the conductor case , and @xmath79 for the renormalized conductor case .",
    "as expected , @xmath80 and @xmath81 diverge for @xmath82 .",
    "the limit @xmath82 of for @xmath83 gives back the well - known result for the vacuum average value of the electric field squared in the presence of a perfectly conducting plate @xcite @xmath84    analogous results are obtained for the magnetic field fluctuations @xmath85",
    "@xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88    the renormalized field fluctuations @xmath89 and @xmath90 given by and , which are proportional to the renormalized electric and magnetic energy densities , are finite provided @xmath62 is not vanishing .",
    "equations and show also , as it is already known , that the presence of a perfectly conducting plate increases the fluctuations of the electric field whereas reduces magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "we can now address the main point of this paper , that is the limit to an ideal conductor , and in particular the behavior of the field fluctuations near the plate , and the presence and origin of surface divergences in our limit to the ideal conductor .",
    "as already noticed , the use of the time - splitting procedure introduces an exponential cut - off function in the frequency integrals of sec.[sec:2 ] giving field fluctuations .",
    "this is equivalent to assume a cut - off function with the scale of the exponential related to a frequency such that modes of higher frequency are suppressed .",
    "a similar cut - off function has already been used in @xcite and in @xcite for the scalar field case .",
    "thus we can take expression and as the renormalized fluctuations of the electric and magnetic field for this model of a conductor with an exponential cut - off function . in this model",
    ", @xmath11 plays a role analogous to that of a plasma frequency ( but we are not dealing with the plasma model , that yields a different form of the cut - off function ) . the fact that an exponential cut - off could be not representative of a real conductor is not essential in our case , because our interest is to consider the limit @xmath82 or @xmath15 : in this limit our cut - off function is approaching one for all frequency , and we recover the physical situation of a nondispersive material .",
    "however , our procedure of considering the ideal conductor through a limiting process allows us to show the existence of surface divergences , and discuss their structure .",
    "as we shall show in the following , this does not seems possible if the field is directly quantized with the perfectly conducting plate , nor if the plasma model is used in the limit of a large plasma frequency ( because , as it is shown in @xcite , the plasma model does not completely remove the divergences at the metal - vacuum interface ) .",
    "we first notice that , for any @xmath59 , the integrals of the renormalized energy densities over all vacuum space vanish for both their electric and magnetic parts , because @xmath91 thus both electric and magnetic renormalized energy densities vanish when integrated over the @xmath18 half - space , whichever the cut - off frequency is .",
    "this also means that , in the ideal conductor limit @xmath82 , the ( diverging ) electric and magnetic energy for @xmath18 , proportional to the spatial integrals of and respectively ( both behaving as @xmath2 for @xmath92 ) , must be canceled by electric and magnetic energies confined at @xmath16 in the form of surface divergences at the conductor - vacuum interface .",
    "the existence of surface divergences was already guessed in @xcite in the case of an ideal flat boundary condition for a massless scalar field ; additional @xmath93function terms were added in the lagrangian in order to take into account the presence of the plate .",
    "a similar situation occurs for a scalar field with appropriate diverging potentials which simulate the boundary @xcite .",
    "our approach of obtaining the ideal conductor through an appropriate limit process , as we will now show , actually allows us to physically understand the origin and properties of such surface divergences of the electric and magnetic energy densities , without additional hypothesis .",
    "we now consider the behavior of the electric fluctuations and energy density for growing values of @xmath11 , and compare it with the same quantity for an ideal metal as given by .",
    "figure [ figdivergences ] shows @xmath94 as given by with a value of @xmath11 comparable with a typical plasma frequency of a real metal , in comparison with the @xmath2 behavior of @xmath95 given by .",
    "significant differences are evident in the proximity of the interface .     with @xmath96hz (",
    "dashed blue line ) and @xmath95 ( continuous black line).,width=321 ]     for different values of @xmath62 .",
    "when @xmath62 decreases ( @xmath14 increases ) , renormalized field fluctuations and energy densities for @xmath18 tend to the @xmath2 law of the ideal conductor case ( continuous line ) , whereas at @xmath92 surface divergences appear with a positive and a negative peak that in the limit tend to squeeze at @xmath16.,width=328 ]    figure [ figcomdivergences ] shows the behavior of @xmath94 for different values of @xmath62 , and compared with @xmath95 ( continuous line ) . for any nonvanishing value of @xmath62 , i.e. for any finite value of the cut - ff frequency @xmath14 , renormalized fluctuations and energy densities are finite in all points of the vacuum region and there are not divergences at the surface ; @xmath97 has a maximum at @xmath98 with the positive value @xmath99 , and a minimum at @xmath100 with the negative value @xmath101 .",
    "the width of the curve , that can be estimated as the distance between the two inflection points around the maximum , is @xmath102 . for an increasing cut - off frequency @xmath11",
    ", the curves in figure approach the ideal conductor limit for large distances from the interface , but significant differences still remain close to the surface .",
    "in fact , while the ideal conductor limit @xmath95 diverges with positive values at the surface , @xmath94 assumes more and more negative values as @xmath103 , and the width of the curve reduces to zero .",
    "maximum and minimum values of @xmath94 tend to collapse each other at the surface in the ideal conductor limit , yielding a surface divergence containing a nonvanishing electric and magnetic energy @xmath104 { } z_\\eta^{\\mathrm{min}}=0.\\ ] ] thus , by analyzing the limiting case @xmath15 ( @xmath82 ) it becomes evident that the well - known diverging behavior as @xmath2 near the surface for the ideal conductor , indeed originates from the maximum of @xmath94 .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure [ figcomdivergences ] . the negative divergence at @xmath16 when @xmath82 is completely lost if the calculation is directly performed for an ideal conductor .",
    "our approach thus makes clear the origin of the surface divergences of the renormalized squares of electric and magnetic field ; these divergences , and their detailed structure , naturally appear in the limit process from the dielectric to the ideal conductor that we have used .",
    "the limit @xmath15 is well defined in our model for any distance @xmath3 except @xmath16 . also , due to ,",
    "both integrals over all vacuum space of the ( renormalized ) electric and magnetic energy densities vanish , as expected from the evaluation of global field energies .",
    "this feature does not seem to occur if the calculation is performed directly for an ideal boundary or the plasma model is used even in the limit of an infinite plasma frequency ( see @xcite ) , because in these cases the surface divergences are not fully included in the expressions of the field energy densities . by taking into account the surface divergences with our limit procedure , we thus obtain consistency between global field energies and ( integrated ) local energy densities .    field fluctuations and energy densities near the surface can be investigated through the retarded casimir - polder interaction energy with an appropriate polarizable body with static polarizability @xmath105 .",
    "when the distance @xmath106 between the surface and this body is larger that the wavelength associated to its main transition , the so - called far zone approximation holds ; in this case the casimir - polder energy is given by @xmath107 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "a similar expression holds for the magnetic fluctuations .",
    "in this paper we have considered zero - point electric and magnetic field fluctuations ( or equivalently field energy densities ) in the vacuum space , when half - space is filled with a homogeneous non - dissipative dielectric .",
    "the material is characterized by a constant real refractive index @xmath7 .",
    "we have then taken the limit @xmath10 and , by introducing a time - splitting procedure with a parameter @xmath62 , we have mathematically included also a high - frequency exponential cut - off function characterized by a cut - off frequency @xmath108 .",
    "we have considered in detail two successive limits : @xmath10 with @xmath14 finite , and then @xmath15 ( ideal conductor limit ) .",
    "we have found that no divergences in the renormalized field fluctuations ( and in the renormalized field energy densities ) are present if @xmath14 is kept finite . in this case ,",
    "field fluctuations at small distances from the interface significantly differ compared to known results for a perfectly conducting plate , as shown in figures [ figdivergences ] and [ figcomdivergences ] . in the limit @xmath15 ( ideal conductor limit ) surface divergences of the field fluctuations ( or energy densities ) at the interface @xmath16 are found , while for @xmath109 the fluctuations approach the well - known @xmath2 behavior of the perfect conductor case .",
    "the structure of the surface divergences has been discussed in detail .",
    "these surface divergences of field fluctuations are not obtained if the field is directly quantized in the presence of an ideal metallic surface ; also the plasma model does not seem to allow to obtain their structure . thus our approach of obtaining the ideal metal through an appropriate limit procedure starting from a dielectric has allowed us to obtain in a natural way the explicit structure of the surface divergence at the interface between vacuum and a conducting material .",
    "having taken into account the field energy in the surface divergences has also allowed us to show consistence between global and local field energies .",
    "finally , we have stressed that field fluctuations and energy densities near the interface can in principle be investigated through the casimir - polder interaction energy with an appropriate electrically or magnetically polarizable body placed near the interface .",
