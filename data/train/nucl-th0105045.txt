    "deep - inelastic - scattering ( dis ) from nucleon targets has provided a wealth of information about the nature of strong interactions and the structure of the nucleon . from the initial discovery of partons in the 1970 s",
    ", dis continues to provide ever more precise measurements of the parton - distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "it is highly desirable to make a direct connection between the experimental data and the now well - established theory of strong interactions , qcd .",
    "a rigorous and model - independent comparison will be accomplished by performing high - statistics unquenched or partially - quenched  @xcite lattice - qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "presently , lattice calculations can not be performed with the physical values of the light quark masses , @xmath1 , ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and extrapolations from the lattice masses , that produce a pion of mass @xmath4 , to the physical values must be performed .",
    "of course , such extrapolations require knowledge of the @xmath1-dependence of the matrix element of interest .",
    "recently hadronic models , such as the cloudy bag model ( cbm ) , have been used to motivate explicit forms for the @xmath1-dependence of forward matrix elements of the non - singlet twist-2 operators that contribute to dis from the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "in addition , these models have been used to connect lattice calculations to other properties of the nucleon , such as electromagnetic form factors  @xcite .",
    "it is well established that one can determine the @xmath1-dependence of hadronic observables by performing a systematic expansion about the chiral limit  @xcite .",
    "in fact , extensive work has been accomplished in understanding the properties and interactions of the low - lying mesons and baryons in both two - flavour and three - flavour qcd , such as the magnetic moments  @xcite , the electric form factors  @xcite , the axial matrix elements  @xcite , and the polarizabilities of the nucleons and other octet baryons  @xcite , to name just a few , and the analogous quantities in hadrons containing heavy quarks  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there has been an extensive effort during the last decade to include multi - nucleon systems in this framework  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we include twist-2 operators in the chiral lagrangian , and compute the leading non - analytic contributions of the form @xmath0 to their matrix elements .",
    "the pion fields are introduced into the low - energy effective field theory ( eft ) , chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath5pt ) , through the @xmath6-field , @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 transforms as @xmath10 under @xmath11 chiral transformations . in order to construct an eft with well - defined power - counting ,",
    "the nucleons are treated as heavy fields in the heavy - baryon formulation of jenkins and manohar  @xcite , and transform as @xmath12 ( the subscript @xmath13 denotes the four - velocity of the nucleon ) under chiral transformations ( for reviews see ref .",

    "in this section we will focus on forward matrix elements of the non - singlet twist-2 operators @xmath31 where the @xmath32 denotes symmetrization on all lorentz indices .",
    "once the transformation properties of @xmath33 under @xmath11 have been established , the operators in the pion - nucleon eft that reproduce matrix elements of @xmath33 can be constructed , and further , the eft can be used to perform a model - independent calculation of the low - momentum contributions to its matrix element . in order to determine its transformation properties it is convenient to write it in terms of left - handed and right - handed quark fields , @xmath34 with @xmath35",
    "from which it is clear that @xmath33 transforms as @xmath36 under @xmath11 . for bookkeeping purposes",
    "we have introduced the flavour matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38 that are taken to transform as @xmath39 and @xmath40 under @xmath11 .    if we are interested in dis from pions , or in pion loop contributions to dis from the nucleon we require the matrix element of @xmath33 in the pion .",

    "however , these operators do not contribute to single - pion forward matrix elements at tree - level , and only give interactions between three or more pions .",
    "in addition , the symmetry of the lorentz indices and the tracelessness of @xmath33 means that these operators do not contribute to single - pion forward matrix elements even at one - loop level . therefore the diagrams shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq : ntotal ] ) differs from previous computations  @xcite primarily due to our inclusion of the two - pion - nucleon interaction associated with the tree - level matrix element of @xmath33 , but also in the numerical coefficient of the @xmath59 contribution . in ref .",

    "while the contributions from the @xmath49-term formally dominate the sub - leading contributions in the chiral limit when @xmath76 , there are well - known examples where such terms are numerically smaller than the sub - leading analytic contributions , terms analogous to the @xmath77-term , for the physical values of @xmath1 .",

    "the reason that such contributions must be included in order to sensibly renormalize the theory at @xmath76 is that the scale for the @xmath1-dependence from these diagrams is set by @xmath99 and not by @xmath14 , and therefore a naive estimate of the size of counterterms in the theory without the explicit @xmath83-fields is set by @xmath99 and not @xmath14 . without resorting to hadronic models , one is unable to make statements about @xmath100 or @xmath101 , and they must be determined elsewhere .",
