    "during the past years the hermes collaboration has carried out a detailed experimental investigation of deep inelastic lepton scattering off complex nuclei @xcite .",
    "this has lead to numerous excellent data on the attenuation of high - energy hadrons in cold nuclear matter which can be used to study the hadronization of particles created in ( hard ) collisions as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    besides being an interesting topic on its own",
    "the detailed understanding of the space - time picture of hadronization should also help to clarify to what extent the jet suppression observed in heavy - ion collisions at rhic @xcite is due to ( pre-)hadronic final - state interactions ( fsi ) @xcite or partonic energy loss @xcite . in this respect",
    "the lepton scattering experiments also provide a benchmark for the interpretation of ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions that aim at probing the transition from deconfined matter to a color neutral interacting hadron gas .",
    "contrary to nucleus - nucleus collisions , where the created fireball is rapidly expanding , lepton - nucleus reactions provide rather clear geometrical constraints , which are well under control experimentally . in the one - photon exchange approximation",
    "the scattering of a charged lepton off a nucleon or nucleus can be decomposed into the emission and absorption of a virtual photon with energy @xmath0 , virtuality @xmath12 and polarization @xmath13 .",
    "in such a high - energy photon - nucleon interaction the reaction products hadronize , due to confinement , long before they reach the detector .",
    "one can estimate the formation time of a hadron by the time that its partonic constituents need to travel a distance of the order of a hadronic radius . according to this estimate the formation time in the rest frame of",
    "the hadron is about 0.50.8 fm/@xmath14 . because of time dilatation ,",
    "the formation length in the laboratory frame then can exceed nuclear radii at high energies . in lepton - nucleus interactions",
    "the reaction products can , therefore , interact with the surrounding nuclear medium during the formation time . here",
    "the nuclear target can be viewed as a micro - laboratory that provides an intrinsic ( variable ) time scale due to the size of the target nuclei , which can be exploited to get information on the actual time scale of the hadronization itself .",
    "the hermes collaboration has measured the multiplicity ratios of pions , charged kaons , protons and antiprotons in deep inelastic positron scattering at 27.6 gev off @xmath15d , @xmath16n , @xmath8ne and @xmath9kr targets .",
    "the observed attenuation of the hadron multiplicities in complex nuclei has lead to different interpretations .",
    "one possible explanation is that the quark , that was struck by the photon , propagates through the nucleus and undergoes multiple scattering @xcite , thereby loosing energy by induced gluon radiation .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite attribute the observed attenuation to a combined effect of hadron absorption and a rescaling of the quark fragmentation function in nuclei . in refs .",
    "@xcite we have shown that the attenuation of charged hadrons at hermes energies can also be understood by final - state interactions ( fsi ) of color neutral prehadrons that are produced quite early after the photon - nucleon interaction .",
    "this very short production time is in line with the gluon - bremsstrahlung model of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we discuss different concepts of hadron production and formation in the framework of a probabilistic coupled - channel transport model which allows for a realistic treatment of the fsi .",
    "we demonstrate that the coupled - channel effects in the fsi lead to deviations from the results of simple absorption models since particles produced in the fsi affect the low energy part of the hadron spectra and thereby all energy - integrated observables .",
    "a strong effect of the coupled channels becomes also visible in the attenuation of kaons since kaon absorption is partially compensated by kaon recreation in the fsi via secondary channels like @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , our event - by - event simulation allows us to investigate how the observed attenuation ratios depend on the kinematic cuts and the detector acceptance .",
    "we will show that there is a sizable effect of the detector acceptance on the multiplicity ratios , which does not drop out by taking the multiplicity ratio and , therefore , has to be considered explicitly when addressing any robust interpretation of the data .",
    "being able to compare with almost every observable that is experimentally accessible we can test the limits of a purely hadronic model and figure out at what point an extension becomes necessary .",
    "for this reason we also include the emc data @xcite on hadron attenuation at 100 and 200 gev muon energy in our analysis where the hard scale  set by the photon virtuality @xmath12  is closer to that of the high @xmath2 events at rhic @xcite .",
    "we stress that our model is also applicable for a broad range of other reactions such as @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 collisions .",
    "a related study of hadron attenuation for high transverse momentum particles in @xmath21 and @xmath22 collisions at rhic energies has been carried out in @xcite .",

    "@xcite . above the resonance region",
    "@xmath23 interactions become more complex and in our model the final state is in general determined by the event generator pythia 6.2 @xcite .",
    "we recall that in a high - energy @xmath23 interaction the virtual photon does not always couple directly to a quark of the target nucleon ; depending on its kinematics it may also fluctuate into a vector meson @xmath25 ( vector meson dominance ( vmd ) ) or perturbatively branch into a quark - antiquark pair ( generalized vector meson dominance ( gvmd ) ) which subsequently scatters off the nucleon . in case of vmd events the same processes as in hadron - hadron interactions can occur including diffractive scattering and hard interactions between the constituents of the nucleon and the vector meson .",
    "in addition , most of the hard interactions in pythia involve gluon - bremsstrahlung processes .",
    "the high - energy interactions of the photon , therefore , lead to the excitation of several hadronic strings with large invariant masses whose decays are described by the lund fragmentation @xcite routine jetset implemented in pythia",
    ".    for technical reasons , resolved @xmath23 events , i.e.  vmd and gvmd events , can only be generated by pythia if the invariant mass @xmath26 of the photon - nucleon system is larger than a threshold energy @xmath27 which depends on the pythia parameters ; it takes the value @xmath28 gev for the default parameter set . for invariant masses 2 gev @xmath29 we employ the event generator fritiof 7.02 @xcite to simulate the resolved photon interactions . as discussed in appendix  [ app : hadron - nucleon ] fritiof is also used to model the high - energy hadronic fsi in case of nuclear reactions .",
    "in contrast to pythia , the fritiof model can be applied down to the onset of the resonance region .",
    "below invariant energies of 10 gev the hadron - hadron interactions in fritiof are always diffractive . throughout this work",
    "we employ the same fritiof parameters as in refs .  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that this choice of parameters provides a good description of particle production over a broad energy range .",

    "these events would correspond to diffractive @xmath4 production .",
    "however , since the pomeron carries the quantum numbers of the vacuum it can not change the charge conjugation quantum number of the incoming @xmath42 ( @xmath56 ) to that of the @xmath4 ( @xmath57 ) .",

    "however , we keep the option to also generate the vmd events above @xmath27 = 4 gev by fritiof to ensure a continuous transition at invariant energies @xmath58 . for calculations at emc energies we always use the pythia model for event generation",
    ". note , however , that the vmd contribution vanishes with increasing @xmath12 and already at @xmath59 gev@xmath15 the vmd part @xmath60 accounts for only 50% of the total photon - nucleon cross section at hermes energies @xcite .",

    "however , we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the gvmd part in the transition region only contributes by less than 15% to the total photon - nucleon cross section .",
    "hence , one can postpone a more sophisticated treatment unless one concentrates on events that are especially triggered by the gvmd component of the photon .",
    "we now compare our results for electroproduction on a proton target with the hydrogen data of the hermes collaboration @xcite taken at a positron beam energy @xmath63 gev . in fig .",

    ". since the data are not acceptance and efficiency corrected we account for the angular acceptance of the hermes detector @xcite , i.e.  @xmath77 mrad horizontally and @xmath78 mrad vertically , for both the scattered positrons and the produced hadrons in our simulation . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : elementary ] shows our result using fritiof for the resolved events below @xmath28 gev as well as for all vmd events above @xmath27 .",
    "the dashed line represents a calculation where we have changed the default parameters of pythia 6.2 in such a way that it is applicable down to @xmath79 gev and , hence , simulate _ all _ events with pythia . except for a small deviation in the proton spectra",
    "both methods yield essentially the same result . in view of the fact , that we do not include the detector efficiency in our calculation , which is unknown to the authors , but only account for its angular acceptance , our calculations are in satisfying agreement with the experimental data .",
    "one can see that without any further fine tuning our simulation including the kinematic cuts and detector acceptance reproduces the absolute size of the multiplicity spectra .",

    "all particles that emerge from the primary @xmath23 interaction start to propagate from the interaction vertex , while the production time only affects the beginning of their interactions with the nuclear medium .",
    "one may therefore expect slight deviations from the real reaction geometry , where the excited string propagates over a small distance prior to fragmentation .",
    "we now proceed and introduce two effective cross sections : @xmath245 which accounts for the partonic interaction between @xmath158 and @xmath159 , and @xmath246 which accounts for the prehadronic interactions of the color neutral object between @xmath159 and @xmath157 .",

    "in this work we have presented a detailed investigation of hadron attenuation in deep - inelastic lepton scattering at hermes and emc energies . in the primary production process",
    "we do not only consider the direct interaction of the virtual photon @xmath267 with a quark inside the nucleon ( nucleus ) , but also diffractive and hard scatterings of the photon s hadronic components . in the latter case",

    "one is motivated by the lund model and the other one is that generally used in standard transport models . in the lund model",
    "the production proper times of the hadron constituents and the formation proper time of the hadron are determined by the underlying fragmentation process and depend on energy and momentum of the hadron . since pythia is based on the lund fragmentation scheme we can directly extract the production and formation times for each hadron from the corresponding fragmentation process .",
    "we have shown explicitly that the production and formation times in the lund model show a non - trivial dependence on the mass of the hadron .",
    "on the other hand , the concept generally used in transport approaches is that the production time of the prehadrons is set to zero and the interaction probability is reduced during the formation time @xmath157 . for simplicity the formation time",
    "is assumed to be a constant @xmath157 in the rest frame of each hadron in order to work with a single parameter , only .",
    "the prehadronic final state interactions ( fsi ) between the production and the formation time and the hadronic fsi after @xmath157 are described within a transport model which allows for a realistic coupled channel treatment beyond simple absorption mechanisms .",

    "however , this does not necessarily imply that there is a freely interacting quark that sees strong fsi . as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ ssec : lund - prehadrons ] the longitudinal dimension of the string and its ( color neutral ) fragments is not expected to be larger than 1 fm @xcite .",

    "a collision of a ( remainder ) string  before its fragmentation  will most likely lead to a different final state than an undisturbed decay .",
    "this is technically more involved but will be incorporated in our future work .",
