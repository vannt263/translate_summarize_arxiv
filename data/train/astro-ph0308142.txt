    "low - mass objects similar to dwarf galaxies are supposed to be the building blocks and should have formed prior to the epoch of giant galaxy formation . later they merge to build the larger galaxies . in this context",
    ", the accretion and tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies would play an important role in the evolution of galaxy halos and is essential for understanding the stellar mass assembly of large spiral galaxies .",
    "minor mergers ( satellites with about 1/10 @xmath0 ) will significantly affect the star - formation and further evolution of disk galaxies , e.g.  by inducing disk thickening , warping , or bar formation .",
    "even smaller minor mergers , so called  miniscule \" mergers ( ibata 2001 ) , with dwarf galaxies of lower mass should frequently happen to every large spiral galaxy .",
    "this accretion of low - mass systems , as a natural consequence of the merging history of a galaxy , is still ongoing and should give rise to long _ stellar streams _ ( johnston et al .",
    "1996 ) around the parent galaxies .",
    "the local group is the natural place to start looking for streams and the discovery of the prior unknown sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( ibata et al .",
    "1994 ) revealed a close satellite of the milky  way confirmed to be caught in the act of tidal destruction by means of star counts and kinematics .",
    "in addition , ibata et al .",
    "( 2001 ) detected another giant stellar stream within m31 s ( andromeda galaxy ) halo .",
    "the sgr and and stream support the scenario of `` spaghetti halos '' ( morrison et al .",
    "2000 ) : galaxy halos build up by accumulation of tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies . but are tidal streams really common around galaxies",
    "? only a few detections of possible streams in external galaxies have been made .",
    "taking into account that sgr viewed from outside would have a surface brightness of @xmath1 , this is not difficult to understand .",
    "the first examples of extragalactic tidal streams are shown in the paper by malin & hadly ( 1997 ) .",
    "using special contrast enhancement techniques they were able to highlight faint structures around nearby galaxies of large angular size on deep photographic plates . from this paper m83 ( fig .",
    "1 ) is probably one of the best cases , but structures in m104 ( sombrero ) and ngc2855 may also represent stellar streams .    perhaps the most compelling example found to date is an elliptical loop , 45kpc in diameter , around the nearby , late - type , edge - on galaxy ngc5907 by shang et al .",
    "recent discoveries include peng et al.s  ( 2002 ) detection of a stellar stream in the envelope of the giant elliptical galaxy ngc5128 ( cena ) , and a fine example in the hst / acs commissioning data which nicely shows that ugc10214 s long tail is produced by tidal disruption of an in - falling dwarf galaxy .",
    "the discovery of these extragalactic tidal streams evoke a number of questions : are they exceptional cases or are tidal streams around galaxies really as common as predicted by current models ?",
    "are these examples typical of the appearance of such streams ? what can we learn from these streams ?",
    "what are the possibilities to find more of them ?",
    "the latter question is addressed nicely by johnston et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who estimate typical surface brightnesses of streams around external galaxies from semianalytic modelling . for one of their @xmath2 model",
    "satellites the stream starts with surface brightness @xmath3and , by spreading stripped material along its orbit , decreases to 28.5after 1gyr and down to 30.0 after 4gyr .",
    "systematic searches for more extragalactic tidal streams , in addition to providing evidence for the miniscule merger scenario , would hopefully turn up more examples of geometrically simple cases like ngc5907 for which comparison to models like those of johnston et al .",
    "( 2001 ) would yield reliable estimates of progenitor mass and age .",
    "what methods can be used to detect extragalactic streams ? while previous discoveries have been serendipitous , the natural approach would be a deep survey of edge - on spiral galaxies in order to geometrically maximize the detection probability .",
    "this could be done either for nearby , large angular sized galaxies with the currently available wide - field imaging devices or for more distant samples using single ccd devices . though the influence of the @xmath4 cosmological surface brightness dimming for galaxies out to 100 mpc will be negligible",
    " only 0.1mag  we have had little success with either approach : in a pilot survey using deep kpno 0.9 m mosaic images ( @xmath5 ) , we have not found indications for streams around the nearby edge - on disks ngc3044 , ngc3079 , and ngc 3432 , and , surprisingly , in a deep ( @xmath6 ) imaging sample of @xmath7 more distant , edge - on disk galaxies ( pohlen 2001 ) we have found only one clear example ( eso572 - 044 ) of a minor merger stream ( two additional galaxies  ngc5170 and eso286 - 018  show clear tidal features but are probably connected to more similar mass sized companions ) .",
    "meanwhile , we have had better success searching publicly available , deep , wide - field surveys .",
    "though not typically centered on nearby spiral galaxies and the typically detected streams will tend to be at redshifts where the surface brightness dimming becomes important ( e.g. , for a redshift of @xmath8 the brightness already decreases by 0.5mag ) , this technique has been used to find three of the four new stream candidates shown in fig",
