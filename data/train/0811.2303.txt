    "@xcite its triangular structure of two straight lines with gradients of opposite sign neatly categorises most alloys into one of two classes where @xmath10 .",
    "long ago mott  @xcite pointed out how this behavior can be explained by requiring either the number of majority or minority spin electrons to be fixed .",
    "this notion has subsequently been confirmed and given substance by modern spin density functional theory ( dft ) calculations  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we follow the implications of this for the residual resistivities of ferromagnetic alloys . in particular , using the latest @xmath6-@xmath7 techniques for describing disordered systems , we demonstrate how the measured apparently anomalous resistivities of iron - rich fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 alloys  @xcite are directly attributable to their average minority - spin electron number being fixed and consequently their location on the @xmath11 section of the slater - pauling plot .",
    "we postulate that other alloys in this category should also show the same behavior and we strengthen this conjecture by the findings from another detailed @xmath6-@xmath7 study of fe@xmath1v@xmath2 alloys .",
    "we also infer that short - range order should have little effect on the resistivities of alloys in this category and again we are able to back up these remarks by detailed specific @xmath6-@xmath7 calculations .",
    "many dft calculations for disordered ferromagnetic alloys show that the majority - spin electrons ` see ' little disorder and that the majority - spin @xmath12-states are fully occupied .",
    "this leads to @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "in contrast the minority - spin electron states are significantly affected by disorder .",
    "the overall electronic transport is therefore taken up by the @xmath14-majority - spin electrons .",
    "alloys in this category include fcc - based comn , fept and ni - rich nife alloys .",
    "on the other hand , for some other alloys , typically fe - rich , bcc - based alloys and many heusler alloys , the number of minority - spin @xmath12-electrons is fixed as the fermi energy @xmath15 is pinned at a low level in a trough of the @xmath12-electron density of states .",
    "@xmath11 of the slater - pauling curve follows directly from this  @xcite .",

    "disorder is accounted for by the use of the coherent potential approximation ( cpa )  @xcite . in order to examine the effects of short - ranged order within the disorder we use our recently developed method which involves the non - local cpa ( nl - cpa )  @xcite .",

    "the fully relativistic approach for calculating the conductivity used here strictly spoken does nt allow a decomposition of the conductivity into spin channels .",

    "the resistivity is dominated by the majority spin channel .    in summary",
    "the resistivity increase from 0 - 10% cr ( 0 - 6% v ) is due to the increased disorder scattering for the majority spin subsystem ; roughly speaking , the contribution of the majority subsystem to the conductivity drops down . this drop down",

    "[ plot : fecr_res_nlcpa ] nl - cpa calculations which simulate sro ( fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 and fe@xmath1v@xmath2 ) as well as clustering ( fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 ) .",
    "+ the important observation from our calculations is that the influence of ordering effects ( sro and clustering ) on the residual resistivity is very small for these systems . in ref .",
    "the same formalism was applied to bcc cuzn and gave a strong variation of the resistivity as function of the ordering state .",
    "the small influence of ordering effects on the resistivity for fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 was also found experimentally by @xcite .",
    "this shows that the formalism from ref . can handle various different ordering dependences of the residual resistivity .",
    "the present work deals on an @xmath6-@xmath106 level with the anomalous concentration dependence of the residual resistivity in fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 and fe@xmath1v@xmath2 alloys ( @xmath4 @xmath107 0.2 ) . within cpa we obtain a nordheim like behavior for small cr / v concentrations ( smaller @xmath85 cr , smaller @xmath108 v ) and an approximately constant residual resistivity of @xmath109 cm in the regime from 10 - 20% cr and @xmath110 cm in the regime from 6 - 20% v , respectively .",
    "such a concentration dependence of the residual resistivity can be explained by the different contributions of the majority / minority spin channel to the conductivity .",
    "the bsf of these spin channels are affected differently by the increase of the cr / v concentration as shown in fig .",
    "[ plot : bsf ] and fig . [ plot : bsf_fev ] .",
    "the broadening of the majority channel leads to a lifetime of these states approaching zero .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the majority channel to the conductivity drops down , whereas the bsf for the minority channel is nearly unaffected by the increase in cr / v concentration .",
    "hence , the contribution of these states to the conductivity is constant and responsible for the plateau in the regime from 10 - 20% cr ( 6 - 20% v ) .",
    "these observations explain the anomalous resistivity behavior of fe - rich antiferromagnetic alloys with comparable electronic structure properties as fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 and fe@xmath1v@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "it turns out , that the concentration independence of the residual resistivity is by no means anomalous for these materials .",
    "therefore , we predict a similar behavior for other alloy systems from the same branch of the slater - pauling plot .",
    "+ in addition , we investigated the influence of short - ranged correlations in the lattice site occupation by employing the nl - cpa formulation of the kubo - greenwood equation .",
    "the inclusion of such short - range effects has only little influence on the results .",
    "+ the comparison of the fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 calculations with experiment show satisfying agreement .",
    "the difference in the height of the plateau , as compared to the experiment , could be attributed to impurities , lattice defects , grain boundaries , etc . which are always present in samples and therefore contained in the experimental data .",
    "such imperfections , which have been neglected in the present calculations , lead in general to an increase of the measured resistivity @xcite . +",
    "our calculations show the initial linear increase albeit with a lower slope than seen in experiment . in ref .",
    "it is argued that this is a consequence of the limitations of the cpa for alloys with a dominant concentration of one constituent .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that our nl - cpa results confirm the single - site cpa data . +",
    "our calculations reveal a plateau of the residual resistivity starting at the same cr concentration as seen in experiment ( at 10% cr ) .",
    "this is in variance to an earlier theoretical study @xcite which finds the starting point of the plateau only at @xmath5 20% cr .",

    "<S> experimental measurements of the residual resistivity @xmath0 of the binary alloy system fe@xmath1cr@xmath2 have shown an anomalous concentration dependence which deviates significantly from nordheim s rule . in the low ( @xmath3 ) cr concentration regime </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity has been found to increase linearly with @xmath4 until @xmath5 10% cr where the resistivity reaches a plateau persisting to @xmath5 20% cr . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present @xmath6-@xmath7 calculations of @xmath0 which explain this anomalous behavior and which are based on the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) method in conjunction with the kubo - greenwood formalism . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we are able to show that the effects of short - range ordering or clustering have little effect via our use of the nonlocal coherent - potential approximation ( nl - cpa ) . for the interpretation of the results we study the alloys electronic structure by calculating the bloch spectral function particularly in the vicinity of the fermi energy . from the analysis of our results </S>",
    "<S> we infer that a similar behavior of the resistivity should also be obtained for iron - rich fe@xmath1v@xmath2 alloys - an inference confirmed by further explicit resistivity calculations . </S>",
    "<S> both of these alloy systems belong to the same branch of the famous slater - pauling plot and we postulate that other alloy systems from this branch should show a similar behavior . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that the appearance of the plateau in the resistivity can be attributed to the dominant contribution of minority spin electrons to the conductivity which is nearly unaffected by increase in cr / v concentration @xmath4 and we remark that this minority spin electron feature is also responsible for the simple linear variation of the average moment in the slater - pauling plot for these materials . </S>"
