    "the experimental demonstrations of photon antibunching  @xcite , sub - poissonian photon statistics  @xcite and quadrature squeezing  @xcite also led to an increasing interest in practical applications of nonclassical states .",
    "an early example is the proposal to use squeezed light for enhancing the sensitivity of interferometric gravitational - waves detection  @xcite .",
    "experiments have demonstrated the usefulness of squeezed light for improving interferometric measurements  @xcite and spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "two decades after the first experimental demonstrations of the potential usefulness of nonclassical states the latter still play a minor role in practical measurements",
    ". there may be several reasons for this fact .",
    "first , the experimental effort for generating the needed nonclassical states is rather high .",
    "second , some applications , e.g. the use of squeezed light for optimizing the laser power in gravitational - wave detection , can be replaced with developments of laser sources .",
    "third , nonclassical states are usually highly fragile against losses which may substantially limit their advantages in some applications .",
    "the use of nonclassical states is frequently considered in the context of the reduction of the quantum noise in a certain observable below an ultimate classical noise limit .",
    "examples are the use of sub - poissonian and squeezed light fields for reducing the noise in direct and homodyne photodetection , respectively .",
    "this requires to link the measurement principle with the observable whose quantum noise is reduced .",
    "below we will reconsider the application of nonclassical states from a much broader point of view .",
    "when speaking about nonclassical states in the following , we will only consider quantum states of a single - mode harmonic oscillator whose glauber - sudarshan @xmath0-function is not a probability density  @xcite .",
    "the nonclassicality of quantum states can be completely characterized in terms of measurable characteristic functions of phase - dependent quadratures , @xmath1 @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) being the bosonic annihilation ( creation ) operator and @xmath4 is the phase parameter . to be more specific",
    ", a hierarchy of necessary and sufficient conditions has been derived that completely characterizes the nonclassicality of a given quantum state in terms of the quadrature characteristic function @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "a broad class of nonclassical states can be well characterized by the rather simple condition of first - order nonclassicality , @xmath6 decoherence in terms of characteristic functions ------------------------------------------------    let us consider a nonclassical state @xmath7 of a bosonic mode prepared at the initial time @xmath8 .",
    "its further evolution is caused by the dissipation to be analyzed , leading to the state @xmath9 .",
    "eventually , the quadrature characteristic function @xmath10 is measured .    in the case of a trapped ion the measurement of @xmath10",
    "is performed as follows .",
    "an electronic transition is driven simultaneously on the red and the blue motional sidebands in the resolved sideband regime , which is described by the interaction hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the electronic flip operator and @xmath14 is the effective rabi frequency .",
    "most importantly , it is proportional to the quadrature operator @xmath15 of the center - of - mass motion , the phase @xmath4 being controlled by the phase difference of the driving lasers .",
    "the total state of the ion is @xmath16 , with a properly prepared electronic state @xmath17 . at time",
    "@xmath18 the interaction  ( [ eq : ham ] ) is switched on for the interaction time @xmath19 .",
    "the observation of the occupation @xmath20 of the electronic ground state directly yields the characteristic function @xmath10 of the quadrature distribution  @xcite : @xmath21\\\\\\nonumber    + 2i \\left [ \\sigma^{(\\rm coh)}_{11}(t+\\tau,\\varphi)- { \\textstyle\\frac{1}{2 } } \\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the interaction  ( [ eq : ham ] ) leads to the scaling @xmath22 .",
    "the incoherent and coherent occupations , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are measured with the electronic preparations @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the electronic - state occupations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ini ] ) are detected with almost perfect efficiency , by testing ( at time @xmath27 ) a transition from the state @xmath28 to an auxiliary state for the appearance of fluorescence  @xcite .    for a radiation field",
    "the characteristic function can be sampled in balanced homodyne detection  @xcite , @xmath29 here @xmath30 , @xmath31 , is the set of data recorded in balanced homodyning for each setting of @xmath4 . the quadratures describe now the radiation mode at the time @xmath18 . thus they carry the information on the dissipative interaction contained in the radiation - state @xmath9 .    to illustrate the idea , we deal with a simple model of decoherence caused by a thermal bath of mean occupation number @xmath32 .",
    "the density operator @xmath33 in the interaction picture obeys the master equation @xmath34 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\gamma\\,\\bar{n}\\,[2\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{a } - \\hat{a}\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{\\rho } - \\hat{\\rho}\\hat{a}\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}]\\ , ,               \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 being the damping rate .",
    "the resulting equation for the wigner characteristic function , @xmath36 , has the solution  @xcite @xmath37\\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\times\\chi(\\xi\\exp(-\\gamma t),0 )   \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the wigner characteristic function of the initial quantum state . from this result ,",
    "the observable quadrature characteristic function , @xmath39 is easily derived .",
    "let us first consider a trapped atom which is initially in the number state @xmath40 , which can be realized in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the motional - state redistributions caused by the reservoir lead to strong modifications of the nonclassical signatures of the characteristic function , which represents our highly sensitive probe .",
    "note that the observed decoherence of a raman - driven trapped ion  @xcite is not completely understood yet .",
    "although dephasing mechanisms could be identified  @xcite , a deeper insight in the role of motional states is still required .",
    "the wigner characteristic function of the number state @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a laguerre polynomial of order @xmath43 .",
    "since the state @xmath40 is phase independent , we may write @xmath44 . in fig",
    ".  1 we show the quadrature characteristic functions , @xmath45 , as functions of @xmath46 , for @xmath47 . clearly , the first - order nonclassicality condition  ( [ eq : first - order ] ) is fulfilled for all the shown number states . for our examples ,",
    "the first - order nonclassical effect is most pronounced at the outermost local extremum , where @xmath48 becomes maximal .     versus @xmath46 for number states",
    "@xmath49 ( full line ) , @xmath50 ( dashed - dotted ) and @xmath51 ( dotted ) , together with the classical limit @xmath52 ( dashed).,width=321 ]    now we consider the time evolution of the characteristic function , @xmath53 , caused by the thermal reservoir .",
    "the initial preparation of a fock state @xmath40 allows one to distinguish motional - state redistribution effects from dephasing effects . using eqs  ( [ char - eq ] ) to ( [ cf - n ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath54k^2\\right\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times l_m \\left(k^2\\,e^{-2\\gamma t } \\right)\\,\\exp{(-k^2/2 ) } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this function can be monitored for a chosen time @xmath18 , as discussed in connection with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ini ] ) .    to get more insight into the time evolution",
    ", we consider the time derivative of the characteristic function at @xmath8 , @xmath55\\,k^2\\,e^{-k^2/2}\\,.\\ ] ] it strongly depends on both @xmath46 and @xmath32 , for @xmath49 the maximum of the time derivative occurs for @xmath56 .",
    "hence this argument of the characteristic function will be of particular interest to detect the decoherence in a sensitive way . comparing with fig .  1 ,",
    "the most sensitive reaction on the motional - state redistributions occurs around the outermost maximum of the initial characteristic function , where the nonclassical features are dominant .",
    "this reflects the expected high fragility of nonclassical effects .    for the used fock state it is interesting to compare the time evolution of the characteristic function with that of the sub - poissonian statistics .",
    "for the mandel parameter , @xmath57 , which measures the deviation from the poissonian statistics , we get @xmath58 negative values of @xmath59 characterize a nonclassical quantum state showing sub - poissonian statistics .     of the state @xmath60 , the normalized mean excitation number @xmath61 , the mandel parameter @xmath62 , and the normalized characteristic function @xmath63 , for @xmath64.,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "2 we show the time evolution of the normalized characteristic function , @xmath65 , for @xmath66 and @xmath64 . for comparison , the time evolutions are also shown for the mandel @xmath59 parameter , the occupation probability @xmath67 of the initially prepared fock state @xmath68 , and the normalized mean motional - state excitation @xmath61 , @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "it is clearly seen that the nonclassical characteristic function shows the fastest decay and evolves much faster than the nonclassical property described by the mandel @xmath59 parameter .",
    "in fact , the nonclassical part of the characteristic function decays even faster than the occupation probability of the initially prepared fock state .",
    "thus it yields a highly sensitive means of detection , since even tiny dissipation leads to a noticeable effect on that part of the characteristic function .",
    "how can we explain the highly sensitive behavior of the characteristic function in its outermost maximum ?",
    "the quadrature characteristic function , @xmath71 can be written as a sum of characteristic functions of number states weighted with the occupation probabilities @xmath72 . from the master equation  ( [ master - eq ] ) it follows that at the very beginning of the time evolution the only nonvanishing occupation probabilities are @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "it is seen from fig .  1 that @xmath76 and @xmath77 attain for @xmath78 roughly the same absolute value as @xmath79 , but with opposite sign .",
    "thus , according to eq .",
    "( [ g - sum ] ) , the increase of @xmath73 and @xmath74 leads to a faster decay of @xmath80 compared with @xmath67 .",
    "the decay of @xmath81 is roughly twice as fast as the decay of @xmath67 .",
    "hence the detection of the characteristic function is both simpler and more sensitive than a number - state measurement , even though the latter is directly related to the prepared number state .",
    "for comparison we may look at the characteristic function for other @xmath46-values , which are within the classical region ( such as @xmath82 or which violate the classical limit only slightly ( e.g. @xmath83 ) .",
    "then the temporal evolution is significantly slower . for @xmath84",
    "the neighboring functions are almost equal : @xmath85 , cf .",
    "fig .  1 . thus increasing values of @xmath86 and @xmath87",
    "nearly compensate the decay of @xmath88 , resulting in a slow decay of @xmath89 .      in the following",
    "we will consider a typical application of our method that could be realized for a radiation field .",
    "the aim is to identify small decoherence effects during the transmission of nonclassical light through media .",
    "this is of great importance for applications such as in quantum communication , where the transmission can be performed via optical fibers or through the atmosphere .",
    "the preparation of photon number states , at least for larger photon numbers , is much more difficult to realize as the fock - state preparation in the ion trap .",
    "however , we will see that squeezed light can be used as the nonclassical radiation source for our measurement principle as well .",
    "let us consider a squeezed vacuum , @xmath90|0\\rangle,\\ ] ] with @xmath91 .",
    "the action of the medium is modeled by the thermal reservoir as before .    due to the contact with the reservoir , the minimum of the quadrature variance ( @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xop ] ) ) behaves like @xmath93 where @xmath18 represents the propagation time through the medium . for the chosen phase , @xmath92 , the nonclassical effect is most pronounced .",
    "the characteristic function for this phase is simply given by @xmath94 its time derivative yields the @xmath46-value with the maximum sensitivity of our method to be @xmath95 which is independent of the value of @xmath32 .    ,",
    "the quadrature variance @xmath96 , and the characteristic function @xmath97 of an initial squeezed vacuum state with @xmath98 , for @xmath64.,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "3 we show the time evolution of the normalized mean photon number @xmath61 , the normally - ordered quadrature variance @xmath96 , and the characteristic function @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 . as expected , the fastest decay is observed for the characteristic function at @xmath102 . to detect this highly sensitive reaction on the reservoir effects ,",
    "the characteristic function can be sampled , at the end of the transmission channel , via balanced homodyne detection .",
    "for the sensitive detection method under study , we only need to consider the behavior for @xmath102 and for the phase with the minimal quadrature variance .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that highly sensitive measurements can be performed by detecting the strongly nonclassical part of the quadrature characteristic function .",
    "the method makes use of the high fragility of the nonclassical effects .",
    "for example , the direct observation of the characteristic function can monitor the redistribution of the motional - state occupations of an initially prepared fock state of a trapped ion .",
    "sensitive optical decoherence measurements can be realized by using squeezed light .",
    "the method may be useful for highly sensitive noise control in quantum information systems .",
    "it is based on a universal measurement principle , that can be used with different types of initially prepared nonclassical states ."
