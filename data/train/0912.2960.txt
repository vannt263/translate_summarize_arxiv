    "the desire for ever increasing computational speeds has led to the conception of spintronics technologies that make use of both the charge and spin properties of electrical charge carriers in solids@xcite .",
    "realization of these devices for useful technologies requires the discovery and development of materials that have easily controllable electronic and magnetic properties to the same extent that semiconductors allow control over charge properties .",
    "this demand has led to an enormous interest in magnetic semiconductors to investigate if traditional semiconductors can be manipulated by chemical substitution of transition metal elements , or other creative means , into offering control over the spin properties of electrons@xcite . because so many of the suggested devices rely on the production and detection of spin polarized currents , magnetic semiconductors with curie temperatures above room temperature that are compatible with silicon technology are highly desired .",
    "however , this goal has thus far not been met and it has become increasingly apparent that to make progress , fundamental knowledge and understanding of the electronic and magnetic properties of magnetic semiconductors are necessary .",
    "although some headway in this direction has been made , the complexity of disordered materials with strong interactions makes magnetic semiconductors difficult to model and understand@xcite .    in a recent paper we presented the results of an exploration into the magnetic and electronic properties of one such magnetic semiconducting compound , fe@xmath5co@xmath6s@xmath0 based on the diamagnetic insulating parent compound iron pyrite ( fes@xmath0)@xcite .",
    "we found that the insulator - to - metal transition that occurs for low concentrations of co doping was followed by a transition from a paramagnet to a disordered ferromagnet first apparent for small dopant concentrations , @xmath2 , at very low temperatures .",
    "increased co doping led to an increased transition temperature and to a more ordered ferromagnetic phase@xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of our paper was that the quenched disorder associated with the chemical substitution has important consequences on the formation of the magnetic state at small @xmath2 and on the finite temperature phase transitions at larger @xmath2 .",
    "unusual power law temperature , @xmath7 , and magnetic field , @xmath8 , dependencies of the magnetic susceptibility , magnetization , and specific heat were measured at low-@xmath7 for @xmath2 near the critical concentration for nucleation of a magnetic phase , @xmath9 , as well as at @xmath7 s just above the curie temperature , @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "these were attributed to large , rare disorder fluctuations consisting of regions of local magnetic order which fluctuate as a single large magnetic moment and that grow in size as @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "fluctuating rare region phenomena associated with phase transitions in systems with quenched disorder are known under the heading of griffiths phases@xcite .",
    "theorists have found the subject of griffiths phases fascinating since griffiths discovered the non - intuitive feature in his calculations that , under certain conditions , exponentially rare regions in disordered systems can dominate the thermodynamic response when in proximity to a phase transition@xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to many aspects of phase transitions where disorder can be treated perturbatively or simply ignored .",
    "these ideas have drawn even more interest as evidence for non - fermi liquid behavior in disordered systems has been discovered while explanations remain tentative@xcite . while it is clear that the disorder and strong electron correlations are responsible for the breakdown of fermi liquid behavior in some cases , the microscopic origins remain poorly understood@xcite . in this context , the unusual power law behavior associated with the formation of griffiths phases have been discussed as one mechanism for disorder driven non - fermi liquid behavior@xcite . experimental evidence that griffiths phases are observable in condensed matter systems",
    "has only recently been reported for a small number of systems@xcite , and in our previous publication we presented evidence for the importance of griffiths phase formation near the critical concentration for magnetic ordering in the magnetic semiconducting system fe@xmath5co@xmath6s@xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to present a more thorough rendering of our magnetic susceptibility , magnetization , and specific heat experiments and analysis , as well as to present the results of some more recent ac magnetic susceptibility measurements made at ambient and applied pressures of up to 7 kbar . in a separate accompanying article we present the results of our hall effect and resistivity measurements of these same materials@xcite .",
    "we chose to investigate co doped fes@xmath0 since fes@xmath0 is a simple diamagnetic band insulator with the same pyrite crystal structure as cos@xmath0 , a itinerant ferromagnet@xcite .",
    "the two compounds had been shown earlier to be miscible such as to form the substitutional series fe@xmath5co@xmath6s@xmath0 without observation of second phases or any phase segregation that occurs in many magnetic semiconducting compounds .",
    "as such , it allowed the investigation of the transition from diamagnetic insulator to a paramagnetic metal , then to a ferromagnetic metal with co substitution .",
    "in addition , band structure calculations have predicted that at large @xmath2 , @xmath14 , fe@xmath5co@xmath6s@xmath0 is half metallic having a fully spin polarized ground state@xcite    we begin our discussion by presenting the details of the experimental techniques that we have used to investigate the extrinsic properties of fe@xmath5co@xmath6s@xmath0 .",
    "this is followed by a presentation of the magnetic susceptibility , magnetization , and specific heat over a wide range of @xmath2 covering insulating , paramagnetic metallic , and ferromagnetic metallic behaviors . in section [ griffneartc ]",
    "we explore in detail the behavior of our crystals nearest @xmath9 at low temperatures where the power - law in @xmath7 and @xmath8 behaviors are found .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the magnetic properties of crystals with @xmath11 in proximity to @xmath10 displaying similar behavior .",
    "we conclude the paper with a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "single crystals of fe@xmath5co@xmath6si were synthesized from high purity starting materials , including fe powder ( alfa aesar 99.998% ) , co powder ( alfa aesar 99.998% ) , and sulfur ( alfa aesar 99.999% ) .",
    "these materials were sealed in a 16 mm diameter quartz tube under vacuum .",
    "iodine ( alfa aesar 99.99+% ) was added to the tube as the transport agent at a concentration level of 2 to 5 gm/@xmath15 .",
    "the tubes were then placed in a small , single zone horizontal tube furnace ( lindberg / blue model 55035 ) and heated to a constant temperature .",
    "insulating plugs were removed from the ends of the furnace to create a natural temperature gradient of @xmath16 @xmath17c .",
    "the charge was placed at the center of the furnace ( hot zone ) , and single crystals would begin to form at the cold end of the tube in approximately 5 days , with a maximum yield by no later than 14 days .",
    "good crystals were produced for temperatures in the range of 650 to 850 @xmath17c .",
    "crystals were etched in hcl to remove any remaining flux .",
    "initial characterization included single crystal x - ray diffraction .",
    "single crystal fragments were glued to a glass fiber and mounted on the goniometer of a nonius kappa ccd diffractometer equipped with mo - k@xmath18 radiation ( wavelength @xmath19 ) .",
    "all x - ray structure determinations are consistent with a pyrite crystal structure with no anomalous intensities that could be interpreted as evidence for a second phase .",
    "the model of the structure was refined to a level consistent with a fully solved crystal structure .",
    "we observe no evidence for disorder , including that associated with sulfur deficiencies , in the crystal structure of all our crystals .",
    "the lattice constants , @xmath20 , shown in fig .  [ fig : latcon ] were determined by the x - ray diffraction measurements . as displayed in the figure , @xmath20 increases systematically with co concentration , @xmath2 in fe@xmath5co@xmath6s@xmath0 , beyond the lattice constant for pure fes@xmath0 , @xmath21 nm , and is comparable to the measurements of refs .",
    "the increase in lattice constant with @xmath2 is consistent with vegard s law and the idea that co replaces fe within the pyrite crystal structure .",
    "energy - dispersive x - ray microanalysis ( edx ) on a jeol scanning electron microscope equipped with a kevex si(li ) detector was performed to check the stoichiometry of our samples .",
    "these revealed that the co concentration was about @xmath22 times the nominal co concentration of the starting materials , while the sum of the co and fe densities was within error , @xmath23% , of one half the sulfur density .",
    "magnetization , @xmath24 , and magnetic susceptibility ( both ac and dc ) measurements were performed in a quantum design superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer ( mpms ) for temperatures , @xmath25 k and dc magnetic fields , @xmath8 , of up to 5 t. ac susceptibility measurements were carried out over a range of excitation fields from 0.1 to 1.5 oe and excitation frequencies from 1 hz to 1 khz . in addition ,",
    "ac magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed in a dilution refrigerator above 50 mk at @xmath4 , a frequency of 1 khz , and an excitation field of 1.5 oe .",
    "the saturation magnetization was determined by dc magnetization measurements at 1.8 k and high fields ( up to 5 t ) .",
    "these measurements were consistent with our edx measurements showing a magnetic moment density of @xmath26 times the nominal co concentration . because @xmath24 measurements are easily performed and highly reproducible , we have subsequently used the saturated magnetization to determine the co concentration of our samples .",
    "thus , throughout this manuscript the stoichiometry of the samples noted in the figures and text was determined in this manner .",
    "the variations in the saturated magnetization for crystals from the same growth batch was measured to be @xmath27% of the average value .",
    "therefore , we report @xmath2 determined from measurements of @xmath24 at high field for the crystals used in each of our measurements . wherever possible",
    ", the same crystal was employed for several different measurement types , particularly for the measurement of the ac susceptibility and specific heat below 1 k.    the magnetic susceptibility of several of our crystals was measured with applied pressure ranging from ambient to 7 kbar in a beryllium - copper pressure cell@xcite . our pressure cell was based on previously published designs@xcite .",
    "the pressure cell was machined from beryllium - copper alloy 25 since this material has a low magnetic susceptibility and superior mechanical properties .",
    "after machining , the cell was annealed in air at a temperature of 335 @xmath17c for 2 hours .",
    "we designed our pressure cell to have a length of 12 cm to reduce the background seen by the squid pickup coils originating from the ends of the cell .",
    "the pistons are made from high purity technox 3000 zirconia rods from dynamic ceramic .",
    "this resulted in a small , diamagnetic , ( @xmath28 emu at 50 oe field ) background signal due to the lack of zirconia at the sample position .",
    "this background depended slightly on the distance between the ends of the two zirconia rods which , in turn , depended on the sample thickness , increasing for larger separations .",
    "the sample was placed inside a teflon container which was sealed with a beryllium - copper cap and retainer .",
    "the teflon container is filled with silicon oil ( dow corning 704 ) as the pressure transmission medium ( see for example ref . for more on silicon oil as a pressure transmission medium ) .",
    "the pressure at the sample position was determined by placing a small ( 0.5 mg ) ( v@xmath29ti@xmath30)@xmath0o@xmath31 crystal in the teflon container for use as a manometer@xcite .",
    "this material makes an excellent manometer as it displays a readily measurable metal - to - insulator transition which varies linearly in @xmath7 with pressure for pressures of up to 10 kbar@xcite .",
    "the specific heat was measured using a standard thermal relaxation method in a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) above 2 k and a dilution refrigerator above 100 mk . for measurements below 2",
    "k single crystals were polished flat and mounted on a sapphire substrate with ge varnish .",
    "the opposite side of the 0.25 mm thick sapphire substrate contained a ruo resistance thermometer which was notched to provide a thermometer - heater pair in good thermal contact with the sample .",
    "the thermometer was cycled from 300 k to 4.2 k many times to ensure repeatability of the resistance at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "the thermometer was calibrated by comparison to a lakeshore calibrated germanium resistance thermometer .",
    "four resistive wires provided electrical and thermal contact of the thermometer and heater to the mixing chamber of the dilution refrigerator .",
    "we carefully checked at each measurement temperature that the time constant for thermalization of all elements on the sapphire substrate was much smaller than the thermal time constant for thermalization to the cryostat .",
    "specific heat measurements were carried out in magnetic fields between 0 and 6 t with all thermometers calibrated at each magnetic field .",
    "the specific heat of the addenda was measured separately and carefully subtracted from the data .",
    "in order to establish the magnetic ground states and critical temperatures of the fe@xmath5co@xmath6s@xmath0 chemical substitution series we have measured the dc magnetic susceptibility , @xmath32 , and magnetization , @xmath24 , of our crystals . in fig .  [",

    "the small size of the impurity related curie - weiss contribution to the susceptibility of this crystal observable below 20 k , an increase of @xmath35 from 20 k down to 2 k , is consistent with an impurity concentration of @xmath36 @xmath37 . not only does this establish the quality of our pyrite crystals , it is compelling because it reaffirms that the parent compound is non - magnetic despite being 1/3 iron@xcite .",

    "this is perhaps not expected since at only slightly larger co concentrations a disordered ferromagnetic ground state results .",
    "we note that the curie constant increases with @xmath2 beyond what would be expected for paramagnetic spin-1/2 magnetic moments for all samples measured .",
    "if we assume that the density of magnetic moments is equal to the co density , and that @xmath55 we would conclude that the magnetic moment increases from just above @xmath56 to between @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "this is the first indication that the magnetic moments likely form strongly interacting clusters over the temperature scale where the curie constants were determined .",
    "the measured curie constant , in this case , most likely reflects the fluctuations of a smaller density of much larger composite magnetic moments .",
    "the magnetic properties of our samples was further explored by measuring @xmath24 at 1.8 k in fields of up to 5 t. fig .",

    "the relevant energy scales are such that griffiths phases may be observed over a much wider temperature scale . here , the kondo coupling scale is only of order 2 k in the region of the critical co concentration for ferromagnetism . the kondo scale is likely so small because the density of electron states , in the approximation of a spherical electron pocket , is proportional to @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the electron density which is more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller , for the @xmath2 range investigated here , than in most heavy fermion metals@xcite .",
    "in addition , the disorder inherent in a doped semiconducting system results in a high scattering rate of the electrons further reducing their ability to screen local moments .",
    "therefore , we expect the dissipation due to a conducting gas of electrons to be a much smaller effect than in the heavy fermion metals where electron densities are much larger and the strong kondo coupling renormalizes the electron dos to very high levels . in addition , the relevant energy scale for local moment interactions is commonly estimated by the curie temperature of the clean magnetic system without dilution . in this case",

    "although there are similarities between our system , fe@xmath5co@xmath6s@xmath0 , and liho@xmath6y@xmath5f@xmath187 , both are disordered ferromagnets that are derived by chemical substitution from an insulating parent compound , there are significant differences which are important to point out .",
    "the most obvious is that fe@xmath5co@xmath6s@xmath0 is a metal for @xmath216 , while liho@xmath6y@xmath5f@xmath187 remains insulating for all @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , liho@xmath6y@xmath5f@xmath187 is strongly ising - like with the magnetic moments preferring to align along the @xmath161-axis .",
    "in contrast , fe@xmath5co@xmath6s@xmath0 is cubic and for @xmath217 has been shown to have a very small cubic anisotropy of its magnetization so that it been described as heisenberg - like@xcite . however , we find that both of these disordered magnets contain rare large amplitude fluctuations that are the hallmarks of griffiths phase formation for @xmath140 .",
    "thus , not only do we find evidence for such phases in samples on the verge of magnetic ordering at @xmath207 , but also discover evidence for similar rare region effects at larger @xmath2 , @xmath11 above the ordering temperature .",
    "in contrast to mean - field forms , the magnetic field dependence of @xmath74 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chirivhfd1 ] can instead be well described as a simple power - law in @xmath8 at @xmath140 as demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : chirivhfd ] and [ fig : chirivh ] .",
    "these figures demonstrate that a small power - law form , @xmath218 , with @xmath219 between 0 and 1 describes the data over at least a decade and 1/2 in field for @xmath140 , while for @xmath183 a much more gentle field dependence is seen .",
    "the best fit @xmath219 values have been included in fig .",
    "[ fig : chidcpwl ] for two samples where we have sufficient data for an accurate determination of this parameter .",
    "in addition , @xmath76 can also be described in a power - law form with an exponent between -1.3 and -2.0 . for fields between 50 and 100 oe",
    "@xmath76 is seen to undergo a much steeper decrease so that above these fields it is consistent with zero being no larger than the backgrounds in our measurement .",
    "the small power - law form for @xmath199 at @xmath140 is consistent with the griffiths phase hypothesis made on the basis of the temperature dependence above .",
    "[ fig : chirivh ] displays @xmath74 and @xmath76 at 1.8 k for 5 different samples with @xmath11 and demonstrates several features that are common .",
    "first we note that for these co concentrations @xmath220 k and , as discussed above , @xmath74 is not strongly field dependent below about 100 oe at this temperature .",
    "this is in contrast to the data shown above @xmath10 , a small subset of which is shown in the figure for comparison . for larger fields ,",
    "@xmath74 is seen to decrease as @xmath221 while @xmath76 is suppressed to within the background level of zero above this same field scale .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath74 above @xmath222 oe is less dependent on @xmath2 suggesting that here the magnetic energy level distribution is much more independent of @xmath2 .",
    "our presentation in this section has focused on the ac magnetic susceptibility of our fe@xmath5co@xmath6s@xmath0 crystals with @xmath11 which demonstrates that we have discovered several unusual aspects .",
    "this includes a highly frequency dependent @xmath74 and @xmath76 which encompasses a temperature range both above and below @xmath10 that is much larger than in prototypical spin - glass systems .",
    "we have found an extraordinary non - analytic field dependence to the ac susceptibility near @xmath4 coupled with a small power law form to the temperature dependence .",
    "these aspects are indicative of an inhomogeneous magnetic system where rare ordered regions form at temperatures above the long - range ordering , or perhaps a glass - like freezing , temperature of the disordered system .",
    "these local ferromagnetically ordered regions are well described by the griffiths phase phenomenology@xcite where the non - universal power - law dependent properties are the result of quantum mechanical tunneling of these rare regions to states with different magnetizations .",
    "in this paper we have described a set of experiments exploring the nucleation of a magnetic ground state in a carrier - doped nonmagnetic insulator . for this investigation we chose the relatively simple diamagnetic insulator fes@xmath0 as it allows for co substitution for fe without the formation of second phases@xcite .",
    "in addition , end member of the series cos@xmath0 is an itinerant ferromagnet with a curie temperature of 120 k@xcite .",
    "we found that the co substitution yields a small number of itinerant charge carriers@xcite and magnetic moments that are likely localized to the co impurity sites .",
    "a weakly coupled magnetic ground state , spin glass or disordered ferromagnetic , developed for @xmath223 as evidenced by a peak in the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility . as @xmath2 is increased beyond @xmath9 the magnetic state becomes more robust to temperature and magnetic field so that the fm state is more evident at fields and temperatures where common tests can easily be performed .    in the paramagnetic regions of temperature and co concentration , we found fluctuating magnetic moments whose size was significantly larger than that expected for spin-1/2 moments of individual co dopants in an fes@xmath0 background .",
    "this led us to the conclusion that clusters of magnetic moments were forming upon cooling below 10 k for samples with @xmath107 and at @xmath140 for sample with @xmath11 .",
    "the formation of clusters of average size of 3 to 5 @xmath94 magnetic moments was also found to be consistent with the measured @xmath99 and the entropy derived from it . because of the disorder and assumed random placement of co impurities throughout our samples , it is likely that a distribution of cluster sizes results .",
    "this distribution is likely to have a very long tail for large cluster sizes so that there may be rare regions of local magnetic order .",
    "such a description fits in well with the sensitivity to magnetic fields that we observed in the susceptibility and magnetization of our crystals .",
    "we posit that it is these rare regions of incipient order that cause the unusual temperature and magnetic field dependencies that we measured in the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat .",
    "the consistent appearance of small power - laws in our analysis of both the low temperature behavior of samples in proximity to @xmath9 and at temperatures just above @xmath10 for samples with @xmath11 lead us to conclude that griffiths phase physics is the most likely mechanism determining the static and dynamic properties of this system@xcite . in this scenario",
    "large rare regions of order appear in disordered magnets at temperatures below the critical temperature of the system without disorder . these ordered regions which act as single large magnetic moments are subject to tunneling events where the magnetic moment reverses . when a distribution of cluster sizes is included , small power - law temperature dependences are predicted .",
    "details such as the anisotropies ( ising - like or heisenberg - like moments ) as well as the mechanisms for dissipation are thought to determine the observability conditions for these effects@xcite .",
    "fe@xmath5co@xmath6s@xmath0 appears to be a system where such effects may be observable over a wide temperature range as the kondo temperatures we measure are small , of order 1 k@xcite , while the weiss temperatures are typically much larger , so that dissipation by way of the charge carriers may be relevant only at the lowest temperatures .",
    "it is no surprise that the disorder inherent to a doped semiconducting system can lead to the formation of an inhomogeneous magnetic state at low temperatures .",
    "what we find extraordinary are the unusual power - law temperature and magnetic field dependencies of physical properties that we measure along with the very sharp , non - analytic , field dependence of the magnetic susceptibility near @xmath4 . that a simple model of disordered magnets@xcite which postulates the existence of rare ordered regions can describe the broad features of such a complicated system is both surprising and compelling .",
