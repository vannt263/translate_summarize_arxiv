    "all these studies indicate or confirm a fractal dimension of @xmath4 as reported by tolman and meakin@xcite . apart from the scaling of the radius of gyration with cluster mass , fractality is revealed in studies of the branching structure of the aggregates by , e.g. , alstrm _ et al . _",

    "mandelbrot examined the lacunarity  @xcite of off - lattice dla and found a trend towards increasing compactness for increasing systems size which is not reflected in the measurements of the radius of gyration of the clusters .",

    "we expect that the large - scale properties , like the number of main branches of the cluster , are not altered under rescaling .",
    "conversely , we take an increase or decrease of the number of main branches _ with increasing cluster size _ to suggest that the structure is not self - similar .    in 2d",
    ", we find that significant finite size effects of logarithmic nature are present which may be related to some of the observations reporting deviations from simple self - similar behavior .",

    "in contrast to the behavior in 2d , the number of branches of 3d and 4d dla increases with cluster mass , indicating that these clusters may not be self - similar ( sec .",
    "[ s : skel - d-34 ] ) .",
    "dla has a loopless tree structure @xcite .",
    "this observation is apparent in simulations of off - lattice aggregates @xcite where an incoming particle is added to the cluster when its distance to the cluster is below a specific sticking distance .",
    "its `` parent '' particle is the one that it was closest to at the moment of incorporation into the cluster .",
    "the child - parent relationship allows us to uniquely assign a generation number or `` chemical distance from the seed '' to every cluster particle . to this end , we assign to the seed particle of the dla cluster the number @xmath5 .",
    "the children of the seed are assigned the chemical distance @xmath6 ; children of @xmath6 particles have chemical distance @xmath7 . in general , each particle inherits the chemical distance of its parent and increases this number by one to find its own .",
    "the chemical distance turns out to be a very useful quantity in studies of the branching properties of dla @xcite and we will use it here to define the skeleton of dla  closely following ref .",
    "@xcite .    roughly speaking",
    ", we obtain the skeleton by removal of all the small dangling side branches of the cluster . to this end",
    "we first identify all the sites that are tips of branches  those sites to which no other particle has been attached during the growth process .",
    "the @xmath8 value of each tip @xmath9 is then passed back to its parent and grandparent and so forth until we hit an ancestor site which has more than one child . in this case , only the largest of the @xmath9 values of the children is retained .",
    "we iterate this process until all cluster sites `` know '' their @xmath9 value .",
    "now let us choose an arbitrary value @xmath10 less than the largest chemical distance @xmath11 of any site from the seed .",
    "given @xmath10 , we define as the skeleton those sites for which both @xmath12 and @xmath13 holds .",
    "thus , side branches which have not grown out to at least @xmath10 do not contribute to the skeleton .    in fig .",
    "[ f : skel - skeleton ] , we display the skeletons of two randomly selected growing dla clusters at mass @xmath14 . in this figure , @xmath10 is chosen to be half the `` chemical radius '' @xmath15 of the cluster .",
    "note that the termination points of the skeleton are located almost on a circle , although we use the chemical and not the euclidean distance from the seed to define the skeleton .",
    "this indicates that dla grows radially outward without forming loops .",
    "indeed , it has been found that the fractal dimension @xmath16 of the path connecting the cluster seed to a given site is equal to @xmath17 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath16 is defined by @xmath18 . in other words , for cluster sites at a given distance @xmath19 from the cluster seed , the average value @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath19 , @xmath21 . for the remainder of this study",
    ", we will consider @xmath8 and @xmath19 as equivalent .",
    "one physical interpretation of the skeleton in dla can be obtained if we consider the aggregate as a conductor situated between the grounded seed and a circular electrode ( a sphere or hypersphere in 3d or 4d , respectively ) of `` radius '' @xmath10 .",
    "then the skeleton is the collection of paths that contribute to the current through the aggregate .",
    "the skeleton as defined above has some desirable and some less desirable features .",
    "first , its definition is certainly simple , which is desirable .",
    "second , we see in fig . [",
    "f : skel - skeleton ] that in an intermediate range of @xmath8 the number of branches in the skeleton is small , which is another desirable feature since we claim that the skeleton identifies the main branches of the dla cluster .",
    "however , we see that close to @xmath10 a lot of branches appear .",
    "their presence ultimately reflects our ignorance as to whether a specific side branch will keep growing or die out .",
    "thus , these branches are a very `` physical '' property , but , nevertheless , an undesirable feature .",
    "we will address this problem by keeping @xmath10 a variable and systematically test the dependence of the skeleton calculations on this parameter .",
    "we define @xmath22 and consider ensembles of dla clusters for which the the value @xmath11 is fixed . for such an ensemble",
    ", we define @xmath23 as the average number of sites in the skeleton at chemical distance @xmath8 from the cluster seed .",

    "some general conclusions about properties of the dla skeleton can be drawn from the definition and are visible in fig .",
    "[ f : skel - skeleton ] .    * for @xmath25 ,",
    "only the cluster seed contributes , thus @xmath26 independent of spatial dimension @xmath27 and cluster size @xmath11 . * since @xmath28 , and since dla is essentially loopless so that overhangs can be neglected , we can determine the value @xmath29 from the number of intersection points of a `` cookie cutter '' of radius corresponding to @xmath10 with the dla cluster .",
    "as the analog of a cookie cutter in 3d we consider a sphere , and in 4d a hypersphere .",
    "the result is @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the fractal dimension of dla , which depends on the embedding dimension @xmath27 .",
    "the exponent @xmath32 follows from the fact that the codimension of the intersection of two sets is obtained as the sum of the codimensions of the two intersecting sets . *",
    "the number of sites in the skeleton increases monotonically with @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath33 if @xmath34 .",
    "qualitatively we observe from fig .",
    "[ f : skel - skeleton ] that the increase is slow in the vicinity of the cluster seed , but is followed by a precipitous increase close to @xmath10 . * for fixed @xmath8 and cluster `` radius ''",
    "@xmath35 the number of sites in the skeleton decreases monotonically when @xmath36 is increased , because some branches that contribute to the skeleton at some value of @xmath10 fail to reach larger values . in the extreme case , when @xmath37 , we obtain @xmath38 , independent of @xmath11 and @xmath8 .    in the study of the skeleton of percolation clusters @xcite , a slow increase of the number of arms for small @xmath8",
    "was found to be due to finite size corrections . taking this into account ,",
    "one obtains for small @xmath8 a _ constant _ number of branches .",
    "in analogy to the percolation example , we use finite - size scaling techniques to extract information about dla from our 2d , 3d and 4d skeleton calculations , which we present in the following sections . the dla results in finite dimensions",
    "will be compared to the skeleton of a random cayley tree model , which can be considered to be the limit of infinite dimensionality of dla @xcite .",
    "in fig . [ f : skel-2d ] we display @xmath39 as a function of @xmath40 for @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 , and @xmath45 . for @xmath46 , we obtain our data from @xmath47 off - lattice clusters , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 clusters are averaged .",
    "the clusters are grown stepwise and growth is interrupted for the analysis when @xmath11 equals one of the above listed values . for @xmath50 , the cluster mass @xmath51 is typically @xmath52 sites .    as a function of @xmath40",
    "we find that after an initial short transient the central part of the data displays approximately linear behavior .",
    "the linear region widens when the cluster size @xmath11 increases .",
    "the approximate linear behavior terminates when @xmath40 approaches @xmath53 . beyond @xmath54 ,",
    "@xmath55 increases sharply towards the final value @xmath56 .",
    "however , the linear region of the data tends to become flatter as we proceed to larger @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath57 is monotonically _ increasing , _ the slope @xmath58 in the linear region can not be negative .",
    "thus , asymptotically @xmath58 can either approach @xmath59 or assume a finite value @xmath60 .",
    "we will refer to the restricted range of approximately linear behavior as the `` scaling regime '' of the skeleton .    in order to distinguish between these two possibilities , we examine the dependence of @xmath58 on system size , here characterized by @xmath11 . to this end , we determine the slope @xmath58 of a linear least squares fit , @xmath61 to @xmath62 vs @xmath63 for data points satisfying @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we use the assumption , familiar from the estimate of critical exponents from finite system size calculations ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , that @xmath58 may be written as @xmath66 here , the leading correction term @xmath67 to the asymptotic value @xmath68 is typically either ( i ) a power law @xmath69 or ( ii ) a logarithmic term , e.g. , @xmath70 .",
    "both vanish for @xmath71 .",
    "the dots indicate corrections that decrease faster than @xmath67 as @xmath72 .    in fig .",

    "we conclude that the leading order correction term can be approximated by the reciprocal of @xmath75 ( ii ) , i.e. , @xmath76 here , @xmath77 denotes an amplitude which depends on @xmath36 as evident from fig .",
    "[ f : skel-2d - finite]a .",
    "however , our calculations do not allow us to _ exclude _ the possibility that @xmath67 vanishes in the power - law fashion ( i ) , although , in this case the characteristic power @xmath78 must be small , @xmath79 .",
    "larger values of @xmath78 would lead to significant curvature in the large @xmath11 behavior of @xmath58 [ cf .",

    "the skeleton probes the frozen region of the dla cluster which effectively stopped growing @xcite , so that our results should be less effected by possible slow structural changes in the growth zone of the cluster @xcite .",
    "therefore , although the fit region of @xmath85 becomes narrower , we assume that @xmath86 extrapolates into the small @xmath36 regime .",
    "the implications of @xmath87 are intriguing .",
    "asymptotically , we can assign a _ fixed _ number of main branches @xmath0 to 2d dla growth .",
    "we deduce the actual number of these branches from the behavior of the intercepts @xmath88 of the fit ( [ e : skel - fit ] ) in the `` flat '' region of the skeleton . in fig .",
    "[ f : skel-2d - finite]c , @xmath88 is plotted as a function of @xmath74 for several @xmath36 .",
    "the value of @xmath88 slightly increases as the cluster size grows  corresponding to more main branches in larger systems .",
    "however , the increase levels off at about @xmath89 , so that on average @xmath90 = 7.5 \\pm 1.5 $ ] main branches result .",
    "we also perform simulations of off - lattice dla in 3d and 4d .",
    "our findings are quite different from the 2d case , a result not surprising in the light of earlier work suggesting that 2d is a special case  @xcite .",
    "in particular , our calculations suggest that in contrast to the 2d case , where @xmath87 , in the 3d and 4d case @xmath91 we discuss in the following the numerical data supporting this result .      in fig .",
    "[ f : skel-3d ] we display @xmath92 for 3d dla .",
    "different curves are characterized by different values of @xmath93 the largest value of @xmath11 is @xmath94 , which corresponds to dla clusters with @xmath95 particles .",
    "the skeletons of @xmath96 @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath99 clusters have been averaged to obtain the displayed data .",
    "the tendency for the central part of the plot to become flatter as @xmath11 increases is much less pronounced than in 2d .",
    "this observation is supported by fig .",
    "[ f : skel-3d]a , which shows the @xmath11 dependence of @xmath73 .",
    "we obtain the slope @xmath73 from a linear least square fit of @xmath100 in the region characterized by @xmath101 and @xmath102 like in 2d , also in 3d the correction term is @xmath103 ( [ e : skel - alpha - finite - general ] ) , and likewise we can not exclude that the correction is of power - law type with a small exponent . however , unlike in 2d , in the 3d case the slopes corresponding to the small @xmath36 values associated with the `` frozen '' region of the cluster @xmath73 extrapolate to a non - zero value , @xmath104 .",
    "this value indicates that in 3d the number of branches of the skeleton increases monotonically in power - law fashion as a function of @xmath40 even in the limit of infinite cluster size .",
    "the skeletons of @xmath105 off - lattice dla clusters were averaged to obtain the data displayed in fig .",
    "[ f : skel-4d ] .",
    "the clusters with @xmath106 contain up to @xmath107 particles .",
    "similar to the 3d case , the slopes in the central part of the @xmath85 data do not tend to become flat with increasing mass and this behavior is reflected in the @xmath11 dependence of @xmath73 , which we display in figs .",
    "[ f : skel-4d - finite]a and b. the quality of the 4d calculations is much poorer than that of the 3d and 2d calculations . a finite value @xmath68 is consistent with the two finite size scaling plots figs .",
    "[ f : skel-4d - finite]a and b. as in 3d , such a finite value indicates a power - law branching of the skeleton in the scaling regime as the cluster mass goes to infinity .",
    "moreover , if we consider the intersections @xmath108 of the straight line fits to the scaling region we observe that they may diverge as @xmath109 such behavior would imply that @xmath110 may not converge to a limit as @xmath111 thus we expect rather strong deviations from self - similar behavior in 4d and for @xmath71 no self - similar limit as in the 2d case may exist .",
    "the realization of the dla growth model on a cayley tree is considered to be the mean - field or infinite dimensionality limit of dla .",
    "dla on the cayley tree has been formulated as follows  @xcite . to the cluster seed ( shell @xmath59 )",
    ", we links @xmath112 surface sites ( shell @xmath17 )  @xmath113 is the functionality of the model . in each growth step , we select ( occupy ) one of the surface sites randomly .",
    "we then create @xmath114 new ( empty ) surface sites and link them to the just occupied site .",
    "the shell number of the new empty sites is equal to the shell number of the occupied parent incremented by @xmath17 .",
    "note that all occupied sites have @xmath112 links to neighbor sites and that all empty sites have exactly @xmath17 neighbor site .",
    "since new cluster sites are randomly picked from the set of all surface sites of the growing tree , we effectively disregard screening of the interior parts of the tree , which in finite dimensions is the essential mechanism to produce low dimensional fractal structures @xcite . we have numerically grown clusters of this tree model with functionality @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 as large as @xmath118 shells . as a function of the shell number",
    ", the number of occupied sites grows exponentially @xcite .",
    "similar to the case of 3d and 4d dla , the skeleton shows no sign of saturation as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "the increase seems to have even exponential character , with @xmath119 , and prefactors that depend on @xmath112 and @xmath36 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the situation in 3d and 4d dla , where the skeleton as a function of @xmath40 also increases , albeit in a power - law fashion .",
    "the number of branches @xmath0 of dla has been used as an important morphological characterization of the cluster  @xcite . in 2d",
    "using conformal mapping arguments , ball @xcite has proposed that the maximum number of stable branches @xmath120 is related to the mass scaling dimension @xmath121 of the cluster by @xmath122 for @xmath123 this relation predicts @xmath124 similarly , turkevich and scher  @xcite have modeled the the tips of the cluster as the corners of a convex polygonal cluster envelope .",
    "the number @xmath125 of branches then determines the tip angles and those in turn the mass scaling dimension , namely , @xmath126 if one replaces @xmath127 from eq .",
    "( [ e : n_of_d ] ) and assumes @xmath128 , we obtain @xmath129 , in agreement with the previous prediction .",
    "both numbers seem to be significantly smaller than our finding @xmath130 in 2d . ]",
    "it is not clear why @xmath0 should be different from @xmath120 following from eq .",
    "( [ e : n_of_d ] ) . on the one hand , if the actual number of branches is larger than the maximum number of stable ones then the competition among branches for the incoming flux of random walkers will cause branches to die ( cf .",
    "if , on the other hand , the number of branches is too small , then new branches will be created because the fjords of the aggregate are not sufficiently screened to suppress growth .",
    "if , in fact , @xmath120 and @xmath0 do not coincide , the reason could be that large branches may finally split , and one of the now too numerous arms will finally die out , but slowly enough to increase the number of branches apparent in the skeleton .",
    "recently , mandelbrot has investigated the lacunarity of off - lattice dla @xcite . to calculate the lacunarity of a cluster of span @xmath11 , we ( i ) select the frozen interior region of the cluster ( of span @xmath131  @xmath132 ) and rescale all the particles coordinates into the unit circle , then ( ii ) center solid disks of radius @xmath133 on the rescaled particle positions and ( iii ) determine the area fraction @xmath134 of the unit circle covered by the @xmath135 disks . for a `` normal '' fractal ,",
    "one expects @xmath134 to saturate when @xmath11 increases and in this case to provide a measure for the lacunarity of the object . for dla",
    "however , @xmath134 increases continuously with @xmath11 .",
    "mandelbrot argues accordingly that either dla displays a `` massive transient '' or a `` limitless drift '' towards increasing compactness .",
    "we argue that the logarithmic finite size corrections that we see in 2d in the approach of @xmath85 to its asymptotics can explain the `` massive transient '' picture . as we have seen above , @xmath85 increases with system size corresponding to structurally different clusters with more main branches @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , the area fraction @xmath134 increases .",
    "thus , off - lattice dla shows a very slow structural change towards its asymptotic structure , similar to its on - lattice siblings .      the remaining open question is why on the one hand @xmath136 in 2d , but , on the other hand , @xmath137 in 3d and 4d and in the latter case possibly even a divergence of @xmath108 with @xmath11 .",
    "let us first note , that 2d is known to be a `` critical dimension '' for radial dla with respect to the scaling properties of the growth probabilities of the surface sites  @xcite .",
    "we find two more indications supporting our result , one from a simple consideration of the cluster density in different spatial dimensionalities , the other from a comparison of the correlated dla tree to a random tree model , for which the scaling behavior of the skeleton is known @xcite .",
    "we have already noted above that the number of branches in the skeleton at its termination points at @xmath10 is @xmath138 thus , for given @xmath139 , there are many more branches present in the 3d and 4d skeleton than in the 2d skeleton . in order that these branches contribute to the skeleton in the scaling region they must originate deep in the cluster interior .    with increasing dimension , the screening of the cluster interior from incoming particles decreases .",
    "this decrease manifests itself for example in the strong semi - exponential screening of the cluster fjords in 2d @xcite in contrast to the power - law type @xcite screening in 3d or in the screening free cayley - tree model  where we also observe @xmath137 .",
    "qualitatively , the reduction of screening can also be seen in the mean - field expression for the particle penetration depth @xmath140 the penetration depth increases with @xmath27 , because @xmath31 approaches @xmath141 from above .. ] therefore we conclude that the weaker screening in dimensions @xmath142 is responsible for the further increase in the number of branches of the skeleton both as a function of @xmath40 and as a function of cluster size @xmath11 .",
    "dla has the structure of a tree .",
    "thus , we find it instructive to compare our findings for the off - lattice dla skeleton to results for the skeleton of a _ random _ tree model @xcite .",
    "this tree model is defined on a 2d square lattice and characterized by a tunable `` intrinsic '' dimension @xmath143 , which determines how the mass @xmath144 of the tree object depends on the chemical distance @xmath8 from the cluster seed , i.e. , @xmath145 to this end , we occupy randomly exactly @xmath146 sites in the @xmath8th chemical shell ( or fewer if necessary )  all the other sites are blocked . only those sites in the @xmath8th shell",
    "shall be occupied that do not close loops , i.e. , that are not neighbors to sites in previous shells .",
    "note that apart from possible constraints due to the embedding lattice at small @xmath8 , the _ topological _ structure of the clusters does _ not _ depend on the dimension of the embedding lattice .",
    "reference @xcite then considers the skeleton @xmath147 of a tree with intrinsic dimension @xmath143 .",
    "in contrast to dla , here in general @xmath148 , because the last chemical shell contains @xmath149 sites . in these random tree models there exists a sharp transition value @xmath150 which separates two regions with different types of behavior . for trees with @xmath151",
    "the skeleton displays a flat  approximately constant  region as a function of @xmath8 , like the one observed in the 2d dla case ( _ non - branching _ skeleton ) .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath143 the skeleton displays a well defined power - law increase as function of @xmath152 i.e. , @xmath153 ( _ branching _ skeleton ) .",
    "thus , if we consider dla as such a random tree , we expect a branching skeleton for spatial dimension @xmath142 , since @xmath154 in 2d , @xmath31 is only slightly larger than @xmath155 , or even equal to @xmath155 within the error bars , which is consistent with the observed non - branching skeleton .",
    "we have determined the skeleton of comparatively large ( @xmath156 sites ) off - lattice dla clusters in 2d , 3d and 4d .",
    "we find that , asymptotically , in 2d the skeleton of dla suggests a fixed number of @xmath157 main branches and a self - similar structure . in 3d and 4d , and possibly all spatial dimensions @xmath158 , the dla skeleton is a ramified object , which displays branching over the whole range of @xmath8-values for which it is defined .    for all dimensions",
    "we find strong finite - size effects corresponding to a slow change in the structure of dla as the cluster size increases .",
    "the presence of strong corrections to scaling of logarithmic character in 2d dla is in agreement with findings of deviations from self - similar behavior reported elsewhere .",
    "moreover , in 4d , it is possible that the structure of the aggregate keeps changing even asymptotically , such that there is no self - similar limit .",

    "<S> we find that initially with increasing distance from the cluster seed the number of branches increases in all dimensions . in two dimensions , the increase in the number of branches levels off at larger distances , indicating a fixed number of @xmath2 main branches of dla . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in three and four dimensions , the skeleton continues to ramify strongly as one proceeds from the cluster center outward , and we find no indication of a constant number of main branches . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , we find no indication for a fixed @xmath0 in a study of dla on the cayley tree . in two dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> we find strong corrections to scaling of logarithmic character , which can help to explain recently reported deviations from self - similar behavior . </S>"
