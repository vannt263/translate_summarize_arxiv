    "in the scale - space literature , there are a lot of papers discussing the gaussian scale - space as the only linear scale - space , such as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the gaussian scale space is obtained as the solution of the heat equation . however , the link between image processing and the heat conduction is not obvious ( @xcite ) . in @xcite , m. felsberg and g. sommer",
    "prove a new linear scale - space which is generated by the poisson kernel , that is the poisson scale - space in two - dimensional ( 2d ) spaces .",
    "the poisson scale - space is obtained by poisson filtering ( the convolution of the original signal and the poisson kernel ) .",
    "the harmonic conjugate ( the convolution of the original signal and the conjugate poisson kernel ) yields the corresponding figure flow at all scales . the poisson scale - space and its corresponding figure flow form the monogenic scale - space . for more details in relation to the scale - space , please see @xcite . in mathematics , monogenic",
    "scale - space is the hardy space in the upper half - space @xmath0 .",
    "the boundary value of a monogenic function in the upper half - space is a monogenic signal .",
    "monogenic signal is regarded as a generalization of analytic signal from one dimensional space to higher dimensional case , which is first studied by m. felsberg and g. sommer in 2001 in @xcite .",
    "it is defined by an original signal with its hilbert transform in higher dimensions ( the combination of riesz transform ) . just as the analytic signal , monogenic signal can be written in the polar form and then it provides the signal features , such as the local amplitude and the local phase - vector , see @xcite and @xcite . in the book @xcite ,",
    "the author study the monogenic signals in detailed . in our paper @xcite ,",
    "we first give a scalar - valued phase derivative ( local frequency ) of a multivariate signal in higher dimensions .",
    "then we studied the applications of it in @xcite . in this paper , we obtain some fundamental relations between such defined phase derivative and the fourier frequency . these results generalize the results in cohen s book @xcite and the latest results of quadrature phase derivative in one - dimensional space ( @xcite ) to higher dimensional cases .",
    "recently , in @xcite , we give the uncertainty principles for multi - valued signals .    why study monogenic scale - space ?",
    "monogenic signals at any scale @xmath0 form monogenic scale - space .",
    "so the representation of monogenic scale - space is just a monogenic function in the upper half - space .",
    "therefore , considering the monogenic scale space instead of monogenic signals , provides us more analysis tools . such as , clifford analysis and harmonic analysis .",
    "in the monogenic scale - space , the important features in image processing , such as local phase - vector , local amplitude , local attenuation ( the log of local amplitude ) involving through scale @xmath1 are given in @xcite .",

    "they apply a method , that is differential phase congruency for edge detection . for",
    "intrinsically 2d neighborhoods , the relationship between local attenuation and local phase are not given in [ fs2 ] and @xcite .",
    "in this paper , using clifford analysis , we derive the relationship between the local attenuation and the local phase in higher dimensions . the important",
    "one is that we obtain the relationship between the local attenuation and the scalar - valued phase derivative defined in @xcite .",
