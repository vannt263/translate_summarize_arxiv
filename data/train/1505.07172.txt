    "the newest generation of ultra - miniaturized engines now under development are constructed using colloidal sized objects , which are engineered to react with solute in a solution in which the colloids are immersed , and convert the chemical reaction energy into mechanical self - propulsion without moving parts ( for reviews see howse @xcite , sen and velegol @xcite , wang @xcite , schmidt @xcite , pumera @xcite , kapral @xcite , and ozin @xcite ) .",
    "these autonomous molecular locomotors or artificial swimmers represent a bottom - up approach to mechanical design made possible by advances in micro and nano - fabrication , and are at the center of a wide range of potential applications at the micro- and nano - scale .",
    "the locomoters themselves can be used as micropumps @xcite , or as roving sensors if their chemical propulsion is affected by the presence of solute @xcite .",
    "the locomoters can be configured with chemical receptors to function as transporters for capturing , towing and delivering molecular cargo @xcite as for example drugs to selected targets @xcite , molecular building blocks to assemble supramolecular structures @xcite , or analytes in microfluidic networks for lab on a chip operations @xcite .",
    "colloidal motors with chemical receptors have also shown promise as the engines of shuttles for the capture and movement of biological cells @xcite .",
    "the operating principle for the self - propulsion of molecular motors is the chemico - mechanical transduction mechanism which converts the reaction energy into the propulsive motion .",
    "the first set of synthetic locomotors were bimetallic rods made of platinum and gold ( a few microns in length and a few hundred nanometers in diameter ) prepared by sequential electrodeposition in a membrane template .",
    "a catalytic oxidation of a solute , hydrogen peroxide takes place on the platinum ( anode ) side of the rod to produce protons in solution , and electrons .",
    "the protons migrate to the opposite gold ( cathode ) side of the rod through the solution , while the electrons conduct through the rod to the gold side . at this cathode end",
    ", hydrogen peroxide combines with the released protons and the electrons conducted through the metal to produce water @xcite .",
    "the accumulation of protons at one end of the bisegmented rod , relative to the opposite end creates an electric dipole field around the rod directed from the anode to the cathode .",
    "the field acts on the diffuse layer of positive charge in the water around the cylindrical sides of the particle ( which balances the negative charge of the metal ) driving fluid from the anode to the cathode and propelling the rod in the opposite direction .",
    "more recent research has adopted a tubular configuration for the engine , rather than a nano - rod structure , in order to increase the efficiency of the hydrodynamic propulsion .",
    "using either thin - film roll - up technology @xcite , or template membrane electrodeposition , conically shaped hollow cylinders are formed tens of microns in length and a few microns in diameter with an inner catalytic platinum surface which catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen on the inside of the cylinder .",
    "the buildup of oxygen creates bubbles which are expelled through the wider opening of the cylinder , creating a recoil which propels the object .    a third molecular engine configuration , which we will focus on in this study , is constructed around spherical colloids , and has the advantage that it is the easiest of the engines to fabricate .",
    "in this design , as shown in fig . [ diffusiophoresisschematic ] , nonconducting ( usually polystyrene ) spheres a few microns in diameter are first coated on one side with platinum to form a janus colloid ( see howse , golestanian and coworkers and references @xcite ) .",
    "the functionalized colloids are then immersed in a hydrogen peroxide solution ; because the underlying polystyrene is nonconducting , there is no electrochemical driving force for oxidation , and the platinum catalyzes the hydrogen peroxide in solution directly to water and oxygen .",
    "the experiments are usually undertaken in two regimes : the first is at a high hydrogen peroxide concentration , in which oxygen production exceeds the equilibrium solubility in aqueous solution , and microbubble production is observed on the active side of the colloid . as in the tubular jet configuration , the recoil force on the colloid projects the particle in the direction of the passive side .",
    "[ h ]    the second case is one in which the hydrogen peroxide concentration is low , and oxygen bubbles are not evident , but the colloid is still observed to move in the same direction ( leading with the passive side ) .",
    "howse , golestanian and collaborators @xcite have argued that unbalanced intermolecular interactions between the hydrogen peroxide reactant and the oxygen product create the propulsion .",
    "this type of motion can be explained by the diagram in fig .",
    "[ diffusiophoresis1a ] . assuming that the ( oxygen ) product species produced by the reaction repels the colloid particle , the excess of this product on one side of the colloid due to the asymmetric distribution driven by the catalytic conversion leads to a net repulsive force projecting the particle in the direction of the passive side .",
    "the intermolecular interaction occurs over a small length scale , denoted by @xmath3 in the figure , and is of the order of a few nanometers .",
    "this propulsion force is termed diffusiophoresis after derjaguin @xcite and later anderson _",
    "_ @xcite who studied this problem for the case of a gradient in solute applied directly across the particle ( rectified diffusiophoresis ) . although , the neutral solute gradient driven self - diffusiophoresis has been widely considered as an accepted mechanism for the self - propulsion of janus catalytic swimmers due to hydrogen peroxide decomposition on the platinum surface , recent experimental studies reveal that the electrochemical effect due to ion diffusion can not be entirely neglected and further investigation should be undertaken to elucidate and disentangle these effects @xcite .",
    "+ unbalanced intermolecular interactions which are caused by an asymmetric reaction around a particle , and which in turn drive a propulsive motion , represents a general type of mechanism by which a molecular engine can operate , and is adopted in this study . for particles in an infinite liquid phase hydrodynamic models",
    "have been developed to predict the diffusiophoretic velocity @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamics was first studied theoretically in a general way by derjaguin @xcite and later anderson _ et al _",
    "@xcite in the case in which gradients of solute are applied directly across the colloid .",
    "these authors studied the problem in the limit in which the interaction length @xmath3 is much smaller than the particle radius @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath5 , and the particle moves through a continuous newtonian phase in stokes flow . within a continuum hydrodynamic framework , the effect of the intermolecular interaction of the particle with the solute is accounted for by adding a body force to the stokes equations , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the solute concentration and @xmath8 is the potential energy of interaction of the solute with the colloid @xcite . in the limit @xmath5 , the flow field divides into a thin inner region ( within a distance @xmath3 of the particle much smaller than the radius @xmath4 ) where the interaction force is effective , and an outer region where it is relatively unimportant ( fig .",
    "[ diffusiophoresis2a ] ) . the inward repulsion of the solute with the particle creates a lower pressure in the thin layer ( relative to outside the layer ) which is necessary to balance this outward force .",
    "since the repulsion of the solute to the particle is greater along the side of the particle where the solute concentration is larger , the pressure is lowest there , and this generates a streaming flow to the higher concentration side as the particle moves in the direction of lower concentration ( towards the passive side ) .",
    "this streaming flow creates a tangential velocity @xmath9 at the outer edge of the inner region which is a function of the concentration gradient along the surface at this edge , @xmath10 where @xmath11 measures distance along the surface , @xmath12 is the concentration of solute along the outer edge and @xmath13 is a slip coefficient which is a function of the intermolecular forces and the concentration distribution of solute in the inner region . from the perspective of the outer region , the flow at the outer edge of the inner region represents a  slip \" velocity on the particle surface . to leading order ,",
    "the flow in the outer region and the translational diffusiophoretic velocity @xmath14 of the particle are solved in terms of this slip velocity .",
    "the solution of the mass conservation equation for the concentration field in the outer region allows for the calculation of the gradient in the solute concentration at the outer edge of the inner region from which the particle velocity obtains .",

    "[ b ]    more recently , the validation of this continuum framework for sub - micron size colloidal particle has been tested against molecular dynamics simulation study @xcite and a micro - mechanical colloidal perspective @xcite .",
    "+ the self - diffusiophoresis of a non - brownian janus colloid with thin interaction layer and a well - defined net potential interaction between solute and the colloid in an infinite medium has been now well - established and it was shown that the swimming velocity of the colloid can be described via two non - dimensional numbers so called damkhler @xmath21 , and pclet @xmath22 numbers ( see below for their definitions ) . in order to describe the hydrodynamics of self - diffusiophoresis , in which the gradient responsible for driving the phoretic motion is generated by a surface reaction , the solutal concentration fields have to be resolved for the reaction - diffusion problem .",
    "the hydrodynamic studies assume an irreversible surface reaction of a reactant to products which occurs only along the reactive cap ( fig .",
    "[ diffusiophoresis2a ] , @xmath23 ) , and produces a constant flux ( dimensional ) @xmath24 of product . along the rest of the colloid surface ,",
    "the solute fluxes are zero since the solutes can not penetrate into the particle .",
    "this assumption of constant flux along the reactive part is equivalent to assuming the reaction rate is slow relative to diffusion of the reactants @xcite and product ( small damkhler ( @xmath21 ) number where @xmath21 is defined generally as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the surface rate of reaction of the reactant @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the diffusion coefficient of the reactant . in the limit @xmath29 , to leading order , the concentration of the solutes is spherically symmetric , and to first order , the flux off of the cap , due to the reaction , is a constant and of order @xmath21 . to calculate the self - diffusiophoretic velocity @xmath30 ,",
    "the hydrodynamic studies assume anderson s expression for the slip velocity ( eq . [ anderson2 ] ) . to compute the concentration field at the outer edge of the inner region ,",
    "two approximations are made .",
    "first , only the concentration field in the outer region is solved , with the constants in the outer solution evaluated by applying the boundary conditions directly at @xmath31 ( the colloid surface ) .",
    "this computation then provides the solution for @xmath32 . as a second approximation , the anderson expression for the slip velocity coefficient ( eq .",
    "[ anderson2 ] ) is used to calculate the velocity . with these assumptions ,",
    "the studies indicate that for the case in which only the product `` b '' interacts with the colloid , the self - diffusiophoretic velocity is to leading order in @xmath33 given by : @xmath34 , \\label{popescu}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the dimensional diffusiophoretic velocity . for a fixed value of the dimensional flux , @xmath36 ,",
    "the velocity is again found to be independent of the particle radius @xmath4 .",
    "the above expression has been used by golestanian _",
    "_ et al__@xcite to model the observed motion of janus colloids driven by the asymmetric decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen on the platinum functionalized side of the particles .",
    "note that the above relationship assume the colloid motion is non - brownian , i.e. the time scale for rotational diffusion of the colloid is much longer than the time scale for the directed motion of the particle @xmath37 , the typical value of this ratio for micron - size janus colloid which swim with the speed of @xmath38 is about @xmath39 and therefore it is a legitimate assumption to ignore brownian rotation of the colloid in the calculation for the short time @xmath40 , however the role of brownian rotational diffusion will be important in long time and consequently results in a diffusive behavior @xcite .",
    "later on , using the same anderson mobility framework , popescu _ _ et  al.__@xcite extended the above expression for colloid particles with axisymmetric , ellipsoidal shapes . for intermediate to high values of @xmath21",
    ", it was shown that the swimming velocity of the colloid increases monotonically until it reaches a plateau where the system is diffusion limited @xcite .",
    "the influence of solute advection for rectified diffusiophoresis was studied by keh and weng @xcite and recently khair @xcite .",
    "it was found that for a thin interaction layer compared to colloid size , the effect of solute advection to the diffusiophoretic velocity is @xmath41 and particle velocity persistently decreases as pclet number increases ( pclet number is the ratio of solute advection to solute diffusion which defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the characteristic diffusiophoretic velocity ) . in self - diffusiophoresis on the other hand , milchen and lauga @xcite found that the effect of solute advection on diffusiophoretic velocity is @xmath44 and hence depending on attractive or repulsive net interaction of the solute with the colloid , the solute advection can increase or decrease the self - diffusiophoretic velocity respectively .",
    "more recently , the effect of external shear flow in self - diffusiophoresis has been examined by frankel and khair @xcite .",
    "the thin interaction layer assumption and the slip velocity argument can be relaxed by introducing a body force term in stokes equation which is a consequence of net interaction between the solutes and also a new term would appear in mass balance conservation which is a contribution to the flux of solute due to the net interactions with the colloid . in this case , it was shown that the swimming velocity of the colloid decreases as the size of interaction layer becomes larger @xcite . an alternative approach to study",
    "the colloidal particle motion in the presence of gradient of another species is the micro - mechanical perspective in which the particle and solutes are brownian particles in continuum solvent and in this treatment the constraint of small and low volume fraction of solutes can be relaxed @xcite .",
    "moreover it was shown the micro - mechanical perspective can successfully recapitulate the continuum treatment of diffusiophoresis in the region of overlap @xcite .",
    "the shape of the particle itself can also brings about propulsion of the particle , in this case it was shown that a non - spherical particle is able to move even with uniform catalytic activity @xcite .",
    "what remains still as a potential challenge is a controlled motion at micro - nanoscale and it s been suggested that by applying an external field , the janus swimmers can be steered towards a specific location @xcite .",
    "+ the investigations discussed above are an accounting of the self - propulsion of a reactive janus swimmer in an infinite medium .",
    "since a lot of anticipated applications of colloidal motors involve in the motion of these swimmers in the vicinity of an interface or a solid wall , it s crucial to understand the effect of interface on the dynamics of colloidal particle .",
    "moreover , we want to respond the question weather it is feasible to steer these artificial microswimmers via an interface similar to the observation for biological swimmers , e.g. spermatozoid @xcite or bacteria @xcite . despite swimming in the vicinity of a boundary can display a strikingly more complex set of trajectories than the rectilinear motion the swimmer executes in an infinite fluid space .",
    "the richer dynamics of colloidal propulsion near a boundary derives from the diffusive interaction of the solute concentration field generated at the surface of the active area of the colloid with the boundary which changes the diffusiophoretic propulsive force .",
    "in addition , there is related work on electrophoretic and dipolophoretic motion of colloids @xcite and biological swimmers such as bacteria @xcite near walls and finally the motion of biological swimmers , e.g. bacteria close to interfaces is crucial for understanding in broad range of problems involving biofilm formation on surfaces @xcite .",
    "+ in this study we will consider an infinite solid surface as the boundary , which we assume can not be penetrated by the solute ( see fig . [ janusnearwalls ] ) . for a colloidal particle which is",
    "self - diffusiophoretically swims in a proximity of a solid wall , the role of the wall is not only important because of the hydrodynamic interactions , but also it distorts the concentration field around the particle and consequently alters the dynamics of colloidal motors .",
    "we denote by @xmath45 the tilt angle of the outward normal of the center of the spherical cap of the active area of the swimmer with the perpendicular to the boundary ( defining @xmath46 to be the orientation in which the active area normal points towards the boundary ) , and @xmath47 the edge - to - edge perpendicular distance of the sphere to the wall .",
    "we will assume stokes flow , and a slow reaction so that the flux of solute on the active area is specified .",
    "the mass transfer is regarded as quasi - static , i.e. the time scale for diffusive equilibration @xmath48 is much shorter than the time scale for movement of the particle over its radius @xmath4 , with the velocity of the particle as estimated by the velocity far from the boundary , @xmath35 , eq .",
    "[ popescu ] .",
    "this corresponds to pclet numbers @xmath49 , where @xmath28 is solute diffusion coefficient .",
    "in addition , we will also assume that the intermolecular interaction length scale @xmath3 is much smaller than the colloid radius @xmath4 so that the simplifying framework in which propulsion is driven by a slip velocity on the surface dictated by the gradient in the surface concentration of the solute around the colloid .",
    "as in our discussion above , we will assume that the catalytic reaction on the surface produces a solute which acts repulsively with the colloid so that the accumulation of solute on the active side of the swimmer pushes the swimmer in the opposite direction , or equivalently creates a slip on the active area in the direction away from the passive side .",
    "hence the propulsion velocity @xmath14 ( relative to the value far from the wall , @xmath35 , eq .",
    "[ popescu ] ) becomes an instantaneous function of the wall - colloid separation distance , @xmath47 , the tilt @xmath50 and the size of the catalytic cap @xmath1 .",
    "our aim is to obtain solutions for the velocities and rotation for different inclination angles of a particle with respect to the wall as a function of @xmath47 and @xmath1 , and from these solutions identify trajectories that can correspond to swimmers being repelled form the surface , skimming over surfaces and stationary in the vicinity of the surface .",
    "these regimes of motion are especially important in applications , where swimmers are usually in the vicinity of boundaries , and engineered motions such as skimming can be useful to precisely direct the swimming motion .",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite first examined diffusiophoretic - driven motion of a catalytically - active janus colloid near a wall using the anderson  slip velocity \" framework and constant production of solute for arbitrary active areas , wall separation distances and inclination angles .",
    "they used boundary element methods and the lorentz reciprocal theorem to obtain particle trajectories , and find that diffusiophoretic - driven janus colloids can skim along the surface for large active areas , and become stationary at very large areas .",
    "our aim in this study is to develope a more complete detailed analytical solution using bispherical coordinates , and obtain master curves for the translational and angular velocities as a function of separation distance , inclination angle and size of the active area so that trajectories from any initial configuration can be computed .",
    "furthermore , we construct a phase diagram to detail the different trajectories as a function of the initial orientation and size of the active surface area .",

    "<S> for other initial orientations , when @xmath2 the particle either moves away immediately or else rotates along its trajectory so as to cause the active side to face the wall and the particle to rebound . for higher coverage </S>",
    "<S> we find trajectories where the particle skims along the wall at constant separation or else comes to rest . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a phase diagram giving the nature of the trajectory ( repulsion , rebound , skimming or stationary ) as a function of @xmath1 and the initial orientation . </S>"
