    "ingalls and kuznetsov have studied the case where @xmath105 in @xcite .",
    "our main theorem is inspired by kuznetsov s description of the derived categories of intersections of quadrics in terms of even clifford algebras @xcite , which we informally recall in section [ sec : quadrics ] .",
    "our category of clifford modules @xmath45 is different from the one in that paper in two important ways .",
    "firstly , our sheaf of clifford algebras does not live on @xmath49 , but rather on the @xmath12-gerbe @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , a module over @xmath25 is locally an @xmath12-equivariant sheaf on @xmath49 .",
    "secondly , the need to consider the subcategory of grade restricted modules is new to our case .",
    "both of these features mean that the description in terms of clifford modules is less useful than in the quadric case , and in proving propositions [ thm : interpretationofcliffordnodd ] and [ thm : interpretationofcliffordneven ] we work mostly with the equivalent category @xmath106 instead of with @xmath45 .",
    "as the title indicates , our results are motivated by kuznetsov s theory of homological projective duality @xcite .",
    "our theorem [ thm : maintheorem ] is close to saying that the category @xmath107 is the homological projective dual of @xmath108 .",
    "we will explain this statement further in section [ sec : hpd ] , which also contains background on homological projective duality .    as explained above , a crucial step in the proof of theorem [ thm : maintheorem ]",
    "is to relate the categories of factorisations on different git quotients .",
    "the techniques for doing this were introduced in this context by segal in @xcite , and have since been worked out in great generality by ballard , favero and katzarkov @xcite , and by halpern - leistner @xcite .",
    "the main result of these two papers is that if @xmath109 is a git quotient , then there exists a full subcategory @xmath110 such that the restriction functor @xmath111 gives an equivalence @xmath112 .",
    "when @xmath113 is equipped with a superpotential @xmath68 , it is shown in @xcite that same results hold for factorisation categories , i.e.  there is a @xmath114 such that @xmath115 .    to define @xmath116 ,",
    "one first writes down a sequence of 1-parameter subgroups @xmath117 and a sequence of open subvarieties @xmath118 of the fix point loci @xmath119 . for any @xmath120 ( or @xmath121 ) , the restriction @xmath122",
    "is then graded by @xmath123-weights , and we define @xmath116 by saying @xmath124 if the @xmath123-weights of @xmath28 are contained in a certain interval @xmath125 for all @xmath51 . unfortunately , the precise results of @xcite are not applicable in our case , as for our git quotients @xmath126 , the subcategories of @xmath103 constructed by these papers are not comparable in the way we want .",
    "see section [ sec : strangewindows ] for a further discussion of this point .",
    "we remedy this by giving an ad hoc definition of the subcategory @xmath93 .",
    "since we only consider a quotient of an affine space , the technical details are considerably simpler than in the general case , and modifying the arguments of @xcite allows us to give a direct proof of the equivalence @xmath86 .",
    "a novel feature of our case is that it is necessary to consider weights with respect to a 2-dimensional subtorus of our group @xmath127 , instead of just to 1-parameter subgroups .",
    "the definition of the category @xmath92 follows @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the overall strategy of our proof has been applied successfully to several examples , beginning with @xcite .",
    "producing homological projective duals by this method was carried out in certain cases by ballard et al .  in @xcite .",
    "they apply this further to the example of degree @xmath128 hypersurfaces in @xcite , in particular recovering kuznetsov s quadric example @xcite .",
    "our proof of the equivalence between the factorisation category @xmath106 and the clifford module category @xmath129 goes along the same lines as parts of their proof in the case @xmath130 . see also @xcite , where a similar equivalence is shown for a single clifford algebra .",
    "the overall vgit / lg model approach is also used in addington , donovan and segal s paper @xcite , which reproves the pfaffian ",
    "grassmannian equivalence of calabi ",
    "yau 3-folds from @xcite .",
    "the fact that we need to take a good subcategory @xmath95 has a parallel in their paper , as one of their gauged lg models is also an artin stack .",
    "they speculate that this category corresponds to what physicists call the category of branes in an associated @xmath131-model @xcite . at present",
    "the choice of this subcategory is rather ad hoc , and it will be interesting to see to what extent it can be made in a general way .    the example we consider has been studied from a physical perspective by hori in @xcite .",

    "grassmannian example and the one we study into a long list of similar examples ; these await a mathematical treatment .",

    "finally we explain how our results are a form of hp duality for bilinear divisors in @xmath149 .",
    "note that the proofs of our propositions do not depend on the general results of hp duality , and so logically speaking this section is independent from the rest of the paper .      as a warm - up ,",
    "we first treat a simple version of hp duality where the derived category results are clear from the geometry .",
    "let @xmath0 be a smooth , projective variety with a morphism @xmath150 for some vector space @xmath4 , with @xmath151 not factoring through any linear subspace of @xmath152 , and let @xmath153 .",
