    "revealing the mechanism in which a clean , ordered superconducting ( sc ) material at very low temperatures responds to the application of an external magnetic field is of crucial importance for understanding the phenomenon of superconductivity at its most fundamental level .",
    "surprisingly , as compared to high - field superconductivity under non - ideal  conditions , i.e. in dirty or disordered materials at relatively high temperatures , the ideal  sc state at low temperatures under high magnetic fields is currently not well understood even within the conventional bcs theory @xcite,@xcite .",
    "experimental detection of such high magnetic field states is currently restricted mainly to magneto - quantum oscillations techniques @xcite , which provide researchers with detailed quantum information of the system investigated , but are difficult to analyze by the standard fourier transform techniques due to the highly restricted range of magnetic fields available below the sc transition .",
    "there have been many reports on observation of de haas van alphen ( dhva ) or shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations in the sc states of strongly type - ii superconductors , showing occasionally additional damping of the signal in the sc state with respect to the normal state signal ( a partial list of references includes refs.janssen98,corcoran94,terashima97,maniv06,isshiki08,bergk09 ) .",
    "however , their interpretation has not lead so far to any kind of consensus regarding the influence of the vortex matter on the oscillatory signal , partly because of the difficulties in the data analysis , and partly due to lack of a consistent theory with a quantitatively predictive power @xcite .",
    "the mean - field theories based on a detailed exposition of the quasi - particle excitations obtained by solving the corresponding bogoliubov  de gennes ( bdg ) equations for an ordered vortex lattice dukan94,dukan95,norman95,norman96,kita02 , provide insight into fine features of the landau band structure , but lose their transparency very quickly and become heavily numerical at early stages of their application to any observable quantity . on the other hand ,",
    "a simple formula for the additional damping @xcite , used frequently in the literature for a manageable interpretation of experimental data , has been shown to be limited to situations of random vortex distributions maniv01 , and to the influence of the sc order parameter on the quasi particle relaxation rate @xcite , neglecting important contributions to the oscillatory sc free energy .",
    "attempting to compare the results of the different theoretical approaches leads to great confusion . in the field range near @xmath0 where the sc order parameter is small and the leading ( quadratic ) term in the order parameter expansion of the sc free energy",
    "should be a good approximationmaniv01 , the results of all numerical simulation of the bdg equations dukan94,dukan95,norman95,norman96,kita02 deviate markedly from this universal limiting value ( see e.g. fig .  8 in ref .",
    "@xcite).the situation in the low magnetic fields region well bellow @xmath0 is even worse .",
    "norman and macdonald ( nm ) in their numerical simulations of the bdg equations reported @xcite that the harmonic of the fourier transform of the calculated magnetization in a finite interval of this regime varies erratically in sign and magnitude ( see fig.5 there ) with no pattern that they could discern .",
    "similar calculations carried out by yasui and kita @xcite have resulted in an additional damping rate which deviates drastically from both nm result and maki s formula , showing erratically oscillating patterns of the corresponding dingle plot , which seems to be indicative of some fundamental problem of numerical instability .",
    "it is therefore desirable to derive an exact analytical expression for the sc thermodynamic potential which will enables one to identify the origin of this erratic behavior and carry out the calculation in a controlled fashion . in this paper",
    "we present such an exact analytical expression within the framework of the gorkov - ginzburg - landau expansion of the free energy in the sc order parameter ( or pair potential ) up to fourth order .",
    "it is indeed found that highly correlated portions of the electronic cyclotron orbits involved in pairing have dominant contributions to the quartic and higher order terms of the sc free energy . the corresponding , singularly divergent distribution of the free energy obtained within an effective temporal representation , results in equally shared contributions from the spatially uniform component of the sc pair - potential and from its periodically modulated component associated with the vortex lattice .",
    "the resulting expression of the free energy consists of two types : terms harmonic in the dhva frequency and associated with the landau level structure of the quasi particles , and erratically oscillating terms as functions of the magnetic field , associated with coherent scattering channels of the quasi particles by the vortex lattice .",
    "the latter are strongly enhanced when the length of a reciprocal vortex lattice vector coincides , or nearly coincides with the fermi sphere diameter .",
    "the resulting analytical expression also enables one to study the effect of disorder in the vortex lattice on the oscillatory free energy . in the white noise limit of the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) @xcite , the erratic oscillations associated with the coherent scattering by the vortex lattice are suppressed , yielding a result consistent with maki s formula @xcite .",
    "however , deviations from the scba should be carefully examined in light of the recent high - field low - temperature @xmath1sr measurements in the vortex - glass ( peak - effect ) region of borocarbide superconductors @xcite , which have shown strong correlation betwen the enhanced additional damping of dhva oscillations observed in the peak - effect region with enhanced vortex lattice disorder in this region maniv01 .",
    "we consider a 2d strongly type - ii ( neglecting the effect of sc screening currents ) superconductor in a perpendicular uniform magnetic field @xmath2 . generalization to isotropic 3d systems is rather straightforward .",
    "it is assumed that the superconductor can be described by means of bcs - hamiltonian density for the usual singlet @xmath3-wave electron pairing    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the single electron field operator and @xmath6 is bcs coupling constant ( electron spin is neglected for the sake of simplicity ) . within mean - field approximation",
    "the order parameter , @xmath7 , should be determined self - consistently by minimizing the superconducting thermodynamic potential , @xmath8 .",

    "unfortunately , gauge factors mix all electron coordinates so that the calculation of the higher order terms is not trivial .",

    "the remaining function , @xmath60 does not depend on @xmath61 , so that summation over @xmath61 gives the number of landau orbitals along the @xmath62-axis , @xmath63 . consequently , the quadratic term can be written as@xmath64or , after integrating over relative coordinates , @xmath65 , as@xmath66where @xmath67 is a number of vortices in the system .",

    "we therefore conclude that the quadratic term is dominated by harmonics of the dhva frequency which implies that to leading order in the ggl expansion the landau levels structure is not distorted by the vortex lattice .",

    "the absence of similar umklapp scattering effects in the leading , quadratic term in the order parameter expansion , and their expected increasingly enhanced appearances in higher order terms of this expansion indicate that the irregularity discussed above should appear pronounced far from the sc transition where the quartic and higher order terms become important .",

    "the resulting deviations from the normal state cyclotron orbit in a vortex core are paramagnetic or diamagnetic , depending on the electron energy relative to the fermi surface , with the paramagnetic sectors leading to the sharp drops of the free energy shown in fig.3 , while the diamagnetic ones yielding the sharp rises seen there .",
    "the existence of these erratic oscillations is due to the highly coherent cyclotron motions of the two pairs of electrons responsible for the singular terms @xmath151 in eq.[beta - recipsym ] .",
    "a scattering process of these electrons which can destroy this coherence should lead to removal of the singular behavior . leaving to future publications the question of how such scattering processes can be implemented into the present theory",

    "in particular , possible destruction of the highly coherent motions of the electron pairs responsible for the singular contributions to the quartic term @xmath150 by an infinite subset of diagrams which are topologically distinct from the quartic diagram , might lead to significant deviations from the scba .",

    ". it would be therefore very interesting to search for , and then evaluate subsets of diagrams , topologically distinct from those appearing in the scba , which might , after resummation , destroy the highly coherent cyclotron motions responsible for the above singularities . physically speaking , it is expected that the effect of impurity - scattering on the paired electrons , as calculated beyond the relaxation time approximation , could destroy this coherence .",
