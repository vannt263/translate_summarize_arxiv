    "since interactions are ubiquitous in nature , it is rather natural to imagine that dark energy might directly interact with cold dark matter . actually , that there is no any direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter is an additional , strong assumption .",
    "currently , one of the most important missions in the field of dark energy research is to provide positive / negative evidence for ( i.e. , certify / falsify ) the scenario of interacting dark energy in the light of observational data .",
    "synthetically using the measurements of expansion history and growth of structure to consistently test the scenario is a fairly important way .",
    "however , for the scenario of interacting dark energy , it is difficult to finely test models using the measurements of growth of structure due to some complexness , such as the diversity of the construction of covariant 4-vector interaction , the large - scale gravity instability , and the lack of abundant , highly accurate data of growth of structure . although the progress has been made in this aspect since the parametrized post - friedmann theoretical framework for interacting dark energy was proposed and applied @xcite , obstacle due to other factors still exists . under such circumstance , in this work , we only consider to use the geometric measurements to constrain the interacting dark energy models ; in particular , we focus on the future redshift drift data .    as a purely geometric measurement",
    ", sandage - loeb ( sl ) test will be crucial to probe the  redshift desert \" ( @xmath1 ) by directly measuring the expansion of the universe .",
    "it was firstly proposed by sandage  @xcite to directly measure the variation of redshift of distant sources .",
    "then loeb  @xcite found a realistic way of detecting redshift drift in the spectra of lyman-@xmath0 forest of distant quasars ( qsos ) .",
    "the 39-meter european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) in built was equipped with a high - resolution spectrograph called codex ( cosmic dynamics experiment ) , which was designed to achieve this goal .",
    "cosmological constraints with sl test have been studied by numerous works  @xcite , some of which simulated 240 or 150 quasars to be observed . however , as pointed in ref .",
    "@xcite , only about 30 quasars are bright enough or lying at high enough redshift for the actual observation , based on a monte carlo simulation using a telescope with a spectrograph like codex .",
    "besides , as far as we know , in the most existing papers , the best - fit @xmath10cdm model to current data is chosen as the fiducial model , based on which sl test data are simulated .",
    "thus , when these sl test data are further combined with other actual data to constrain dark energy models , tension between the simulated sl data and other actual data may occur .",
    "this is inappropriate and may not give convincing conclusion on the impact of future sl test data on cosmological constraints .    to avoid inconsistency in data , in our previous work  @xcite",
    ", we suggested that the best - fit model in study to current actual data is chosen as the fiducial model in simulating 30 mock sl test data . to give a typical example , we only focused on the dark energy model with constant @xmath8 ( referred to as @xmath8cdm model ) . in our recent work  @xcite",
    ", we extended the discussion to time - evolving dark energy model and explored the impact of sl test data on dark energy constraints in the future geometric measurements .",
    "though in ref .",
    "@xcite , a preliminary sl test analysis has been made for two simple interacting dark energy models , a synthetical analysis in depth in quantifying the impact of future redshift drift data on testing different types of interacting dark energy models is still absent .",
    "this paper will provide such an analysis . in this paper",
    ", we will quantify the constraining power of future sl test data on different interacting dark energy models , and show how the sl test impacts on the parameter estimation .",
    "for interacting dark energy models , the energy balance equations for dark energy and cold dark matter are @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the background energy densities of dark energy and cold dark matter , respectively .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath15 describes the expansion rate of the universe and the interacting term @xmath16 describes the energy transfer rate between dark energy and dark matter densities .",
    "we consider four typical interacting dark energy models : ( 1 ) @xmath2 , with which the model is called the i@xmath8cdm1 model , ( 2 ) @xmath3 , with which the model is called the i@xmath8cdm2 model , ( 3 ) @xmath4 , with which the model is called the i@xmath8cdm3 model , and ( 4 ) @xmath5 , with which the model is called the i@xmath8cdm4 model . here",
    "@xmath9 is the dimensionless coupling parameter , and the equation - of - state parameter @xmath8 is considered to be a constant in this paper .",
    "in fact , when the codex experiment is ready to deliver its redshift drift data , other future geometric measurements data will also be available .",
    "therefore , it seems that a more meaningful issue is to ask what role the sl test will play in parameter estimation for interacting dark energy models using the future geometric measurements . to address this issue",
    ", we also simulate the future sn and bao data based on the long - term space - based project wfirst ( wide - field infrared survey telescope ) .",
    "it is quite common that program in built is changed or postponed .",
    "besides , because science and technology develop rapidly , it is hard to well and truly quantify the percentages of the parameter estimation by sl test data .",
    "we only take wfirst as an example . owing to the fact that it covers the redshift desert ( @xmath1 ) ,",
    "sl test is a valuable supplementary to other geometric measurements .",
    "moreover , because of the different degeneracy orientations of sl test and other geometric measurements , it is very credible that sl test can effectively break the strong degeneracy in other geometric measurements and greatly improve the corresponding cosmological constraint results .",
    "it s necessary to point out that this analysis does not mean the necessity of combining the data from wfirst and codex in the future , and that we merely explore the ability of redshift drift to break degeneracy in other geometric measurements and to improve the accuracy of cosmological constraints .",
    "our procedure is as follows .",
    "interacting dark energy models are first constrained by using the current joint sn+bao+cmb+@xmath6 data , and then for each case the best - fit model is chosen to be the fiducial model in producing the simulated mock sl test data .",
    "the obtained sl test data are thus well consistent with the current data .",
    "therefore , it is rather appropriate to combine the mock sl test data with the current data for further constraining the interacting dark energy models .",
    "we perform an mcmc likelihood analysis  @xcite to obtain @xmath17 samples for each model .    for current data ,",
    "the most typical geometric measurements are chosen , i.e. , the observations of sn , bao , cmb , and @xmath6 . for the sn data , the snls compilation  @xcite with a sample of 472 sne is used . for the bao data ,",
    "we consider the @xmath18 measurements from 6dfgs ( @xmath19 )  @xcite , sdss - dr7 ( @xmath20 )  @xcite , sdss - dr9 ( @xmath21 )  @xcite , and wigglez ( @xmath22 , 0.60 , and 0.73 )  @xcite surveys . for the cmb data , we use the planck distance posterior given by ref .  @xcite . as dark energy only affects the cmb through the comoving angular diameter distance to the decoupling epoch ( and the late - time isw effect ) , the distance information given by the cmb distance posterior is sufficient for the joint geometric constraint on dark energy .",
    "we also use the direct measurement result of the hubble constant in the light of the cosmic distance ladder from the hst , @xmath23 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24  @xcite .    next , we briefly review how to simulate the sl test data .",
    "this method is just to directly measure the redshift variation of quasar lyman-@xmath0 absorption lines .",
    "the redshift variation is defined as a spectroscopic velocity shift @xcite , @xmath25,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the time interval of observation , and @xmath27 is given by specific dark energy models .    according to the monte carlo simulations ,",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath28 expected by codex can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the signal - to - noise ratio defined per 0.0125 @xmath31 pixel , @xmath32 is the number of observed quasars , @xmath33 represents their redshift , and the last exponent @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 .    to simulate the sl test data ,",

    "note that here we use `` future '' to denote the data combination of future sn and bao for convenience .",
    "it is shown that with the 30-yr sl observation , the constraints on @xmath7 and @xmath6 will be improved by 23.8% and 3.4% for the @xmath8cdm model , and by @xmath53 and 15.8% for the i@xmath8cdm1 model . for the @xmath8cdm model ,",

    "this shows the importance of including sl test data in future cosmological constraints .",
