    "the group of ternary nanolaminated carbides and nitrides known as @xmath7-phases is the subject of intense research @xcite .",
    "three related crystal structures are classified by stoichiometry as 211 ( n=1 ) , 312 ( n=2 ) and 413 ( n=3 ) phases , where the letter @xmath8 is an early transition metal , @xmath9 is an element in the groups iii - v and @xmath10 is either carbon or nitrogen .",
    "the @xmath7-phases have a technologically important combination of properties that are metallic and ceramic @xcite .",
    "these properties are related to the crystal structure , the choice of the three constituent elements , as well as the strength of the chemical bonding between the nanolaminated layers .",
    "for the 211 type of crystal structure , there are more than 50 different ternary carbides and nitrides , where cr@xmath0gec was recognized by jeitschko _",
    "et al . _ already in the 1960s @xcite .",
    "this multifunctional metallic and ceramic compound is particularly interesting as it exhibits a number of peculiar properties and is relatively little studied .",
    "first , cr@xmath0gec has the highest thermal expansion coefficient @xmath11 , among all the presently known @xmath7-phases @xcite , which is largest in the m - a bonds and smallest in the m - x bonds as indicated by thermal motions of the atoms in neutron diffraction experiments @xcite .",
    "there is also a discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental @xmath11-values of 30% @xcite .",
    "this could be related to a change in the orbital occupation as the temperature is raised that allows the system to show large volume variation with temperature .",
    "second , the magnetic ordering and electron correlations affect other properties such as thermal expansion and bulk modulus of cr - based max - phases , even though they are only weakly magnetic @xcite .",
    "although pure cr@xmath0gec is non - magnetic macroscopically at room temperature , the individual cr atoms in cr@xmath0gec have a magnetic order that could depend on the temperature @xcite .",
    "however , due to cr @xmath6 electron correlation effects , the electronic origin of the unique properties is not well understood or conclusive .",
    "transport properties can not be interpreted in terms of ground state electronic structure calculations of cr - based m@xmath12ax@xmath13-phase materials since the electron - phonon coupling is expected to be strong and most likely anisotropic .",
    "third , the calculated density of states ( dos ) at @xmath14 ( 7.7 states / ev / unit cell for u=0 , and 7.9 states / ev / cell with u@xmath15=2.09 ev ( @xmath16 ) and 2.33 ev ( @xmath17 ) for a chosen gga@xmath18 functional ) @xcite , dominated by the cr @xmath6 states , is much lower than the experimentally reported value ( 21 states / ev / cell @xcite and 22 states / ev / cell @xcite ) , and there is a large electron - phonon coupling @xcite . for cr@xmath0gec ,",

    "we characterize the unoccupied and occupied bands of the containing elements , respectively @xcite .",
    "this enables exploring the orbital occupation of the electrons buried several hundred nanometers below the surface .",
    "the energy of the x - rays is tuned to the specific core levels of cr , ge , and c and the incidence angle of the x - rays is changed from grazing to near normal relative to the laminate plane .",
    "this allows probing the occupation of the occupied electronic orbitals _ across _ ( @xmath20 , @xmath26 ) and _ in _ ( @xmath24 , @xmath23 , @xmath25 ) the laminate plane as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "we provide direct evidence of anisotropy in the electronic structure supported by _ ab initio _ band structure calculations .",

    "this is clearly observed at , for instance , the @xmath31-axial elongation of the unit cell .",
    "our results clearly show that the anisotropy in the electronic structure and chemical bonding of cr@xmath0gec is substantial for the cr @xmath6 , c @xmath29 and ge @xmath6 states .",
    "the generally greater amount of both occupied and unoccupied cr @xmath83 , @xmath84 and c @xmath60 electronic states in the basal @xmath55-plane than cr @xmath85 and c @xmath61 states along the @xmath31-axis should contribute to higher electrical conductivity in the basal @xmath55-plane for a large range of temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , since the c @xmath29 states are in minority they should not affect the conductivity as much as the cr @xmath6 states .",
    "the calculations indicate that the ge @xmath65-@xmath59 states of the basal @xmath55-plane are spread out in the region 0 to -10 ev , while the more localized single out - of - plane @xmath66-@xmath62 states along the @xmath31-axis have a peak maximum around -3 ev below @xmath32 .",
    "contrary to the case of the phonon rattling of the si @xmath6 states in ti@xmath70sic@xmath0 @xcite , the phonon modes of the isotropic ge @xmath5 states in cr@xmath0gec should not affect the anisotropy of the transport properties as much as the @xmath6 states of the transition element .",
    "the differences in intensity of the ge @xmath5 band explain the large difference in the dos at @xmath32 between experiment and theory .",
    "the strong covalent cr @xmath6 - c @xmath29 bonding in cr@xmath0gec occurs in the hybridization region between -2 to -5 ev below @xmath32 and the shallow ge @xmath6 core level states are located at -30 ev below the fermi level .",
    "intercalation of ge monolayers into crc with relatively weak cr @xmath6 - ge @xmath63 bonds thus implies that the cr - c bonds are strengthened .",
    "this also affects the cr - cr bonds that are strengthened , which enhances the metallic character and the density of states at the fermi level of cr@xmath0gec .",
    "contrary to the elastic and stiffness properties , the transport properties depend more clearly on the states at the e@xmath56 .",
    "the fact that the number of electronic states at e@xmath56 are larger experimentally than those computed with dft , is due to the additional electronic states provided to the e@xmath56 by the ge @xmath5 states , which exhibit high intensity in the ge @xmath5 xes .",
    "the ge @xmath5 and ge @xmath27 states hybridize more with the cr @xmath6 states than dft predicts , transferring more electron density towards the fermi level .",
    "this effect is clearly observed in the @xmath27/@xmath5 intensity branching ratio in fig .",
    "4 . experimentally",
    ", the intensity ratio between the @xmath86 and the @xmath87 peaks is much lower than the one computed with dft , as a consequence of the charge transfer from the shallow ge @xmath27 core levels to the ge @xmath5 states .",
    "this hybridization effect clearly manifests on the ge @xmath4 xes ( i.e. , the partial dos ) and probably also has an important effect on the total dos at e@xmath56 .",
    "however , we can not exclude that impurities can also contribute to the very large experimentally observed dos at e@xmath56 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , not only the crystal structure and the constituent elements , but also the intrinsic rattling motion of the ge atoms , can increase the density of states at @xmath14 and hence influence the materials transport properties . while the observed intensity increase of the ge @xmath5 states is isotropic at the @xmath14 , the difference in the phonon frequencies in the basal @xmath55-plane and along the @xmath31-axis should affect the conductivity in cr@xmath0gec .",
    "polarization - dependent experimental and theoretical results provide understanding of what electronic states affect the anisotropy of the electronic structure , chemical bonding , and hybridization regions in cr@xmath0gec . the combination of hybridization , charge - transfer redistribution , cr @xmath6 electron correlation effects and electron - phonon coupling give rise to the observed transport properties . the occupied electronic dos in the basal @xmath55-plane is larger than those along the @xmath31-axis for the cr @xmath6 and ge @xmath63 states .",
    "the ge @xmath5 and shallow ge @xmath27 core - level states exhibit stronger hybridization with the cr @xmath6 states than dft predicts in the one - electron approximation , transferring extra electron density towards the e@xmath56 .",
    "thus , as shown in this work , the large intensity difference between the experimentally observed ge @xmath5 valence band states and the @xmath6 states essentially explains the large difference in the experimental and calculated density of states at the fermi level .",
