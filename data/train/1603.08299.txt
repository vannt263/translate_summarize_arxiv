    "the accelerated expansion is driven by a new energy density component with negative pressure , termed dark energy ( de ) .",
    "the nature of this unknown matter field has given rise to a great scientific effort in order to understand its properties .",
    "the observational evidence is consistent with a cosmological constant @xmath0 being the possible origin of the dark energy ( de ) driving the present epoch of the accelerated expansion of our universe and a dark matter ( dm ) component giving rise to galaxies and their large scale structures distributions @xcite .",
    "the dm is assumed to have negligible pressure and temperature and is termed cold . thanks to the agreement with observations the model is commonly known as @xmath0cdm , to indicate the nature of its main components . while favored by the observations , the model is not satisfactory from the theoretical point of view : the value of the cosmological constant is many orders of magnitude smaller than what it was estimated in particle physics @xcite .",
    "it was suggested soon that de could be dynamic , evolving with time @xcite .",
    "this new cosmological model also suffers from a severe fine - tune problem known as _ coincidence problem _ @xcite that can be expressed with the following simple terms : if the time variation of matter and de are very different why are their current values so similar ?",
    "cosmological models where dm and de do not evolve separately but interact with each other were first introduced to justify the currently small value of the cosmological constant @xcite but they were found to be very useful to alleviate the coincidence problem . in this review",
    "we will summarize the theoretical developments of this field and the observational evidence that constrains the dm / de interaction and could , eventually , lead to its detection .",
    "the emergence of galaxies and large scale structure is driven by the growth of matter density perturbations which themselves are connected to the anisotropies of the cmb @xcite .",
    "an interaction between the components of the dark sector will affect the overall evolution of the universe and its expansion history , the growth matter and baryon density perturbations , the pattern of temperature anisotropies of the cmb and the evolution of the gravitational potential at late times would be different than in the concordance model .",
    "these observables are directly linked to the underlying theory of gravity @xcite and , consequently , the interaction could be constrained with observations of the background evolution and the emergence of large scale structure .",

    "it will consist of a two - mirror compact range design with a 40 m diameter primary and it will have no moving parts to provide an excellent polarization performance and very low side - lobe levels required for intensity mapping .      currently , the interest on cmb ground experiments is centered on polarization . for a cosmic variance limited experiment polarization alone places stronger constraints on cosmological parameters than cmb temperature @xcite .",
    "experiments like sptpol @xcite and quixote @xcite are currently taken data aiming to characterize the polarization of the cmb and of the galactic and extragalactic sources .",
    "cmb experiments devoted to measuring polarization from the ground are also being proposed ; the scientific capabilities of a cmb polarization experiment like cmb - s4 have been considered that in combination with low redshift data would be able to constrain , among other parameters , the de equation of state and dark matter annihilation @xcite .",
    "satellite surveys usually require a dedicated facility and , consequently , are more expensive than those carried out from the ground .",
    "their significant advantage is that , by observing outside the atmosphere , the data usually contains a lower level of systematic errors .",
    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) was a satellite mission devoted to measure cmb temperature fluctuations at frequencies operating between 23 and 94ghz .",
    "launched on june 30 , 2001 and operated for 9 years up to the end of september 2010 .",
    "the main results and data products of the nine years of operation are described in @xcite .",
    "the final 9yr data released was soon followed by those of the planck collaboration .",
    "the planck satellite observed the microwave and sub - millimeter sky from august 12th , 2009 to oct 23rd , 2013 in nine frequencies between 30 and 857 ghz , with angular resolution between 33 and 5. its goal was to produce cmb maps both in temperature and polarization .",
    "the planck collaboration has released data on cmb temperature anisotropies , thermal sunyaev - zledovich ( tsz ) effect .",
    "the measured temperature and polarization , a catalog of sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) clusters and likelihood codes to assess cosmological models against the planck data @xcite and other data products can be downloaded from the planck legacy archive @xcite . the temperature - temperature , temperature - e mode and e mode - e mode power spectra are measured up to @xmath112 @xcite , allowing the cmb lensing potential @xcite and the constraint on cosmological models beyond the @xmath0cdm model @xcite .",
    "erosita will be a x - ray satellite that will be launched in 2016 .",
    "it will perform the first imaging all - sky survey in energy range 0.3 - 10 kev @xcite .",
    "the goal of erosita is the detection of @xmath113 galaxy clusters out to redshifts @xmath114 , in order to study the large scale structure in the universe and test and characterize cosmological models including de . in the soft x - ray band ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) , it will be about 20 times more sensitive than the rosat all sky survey , while in the hard band ( 2 - 10 kev ) it will provide the first ever true imaging survey of the sky at those energies .",
    "euclid is a european space agency de satellite mission scheduled for launch in 2020 .",
    "this mission is designed to perform two surveys : a wide 15,000 deg@xmath72 survey in the optical and near - infrared and a deep survey on 40 deg@xmath72 two magnitudes deeper .",
    "these facilities are not independent between each other .",
    "euclid will map the extra - galactic sky with the resolution of the hubble space telescope , with optical and near - infrared ( nir ) imaging and nir spectroscopy .",
    "photometric redshifts for the galaxies in the wide survey will be provided from ground photometry and from the nir survey .",
    "in addition , 50 million spectroscopic redshifts will be obtained .",
    "euclid data will allow to measure the expansion history and the growth of structure with great precision .",
    "a detailed quantitative forecast of euclid performance has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the data will allow to constrain many different cosmological models ; when the growth factor is parametrized as @xmath115 the value @xmath116 corresponds to the @xmath0cdm model and euclid will measure this parameter with a precision of @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "forecasts for other parametrizations of the growth factor and for other magnitudes such as the bias , de sound speed , redshift space distortions are given in @xcite .",
    "the wide field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) is an american satellite mission that is currently being reviewed and expected to be launch in 2023 .",
    "this mission updates and expands earlier proposed missions like the super nova acceleration probe ( snap ) and the joint de mission ( jdem ) . like euclid ,",
    "one of its primary science goals is to determine the properties of de and in many respects complements euclid .",
    "wfirst strategy is to construct a narrow and deep galaxy redshift survey of 2000 deg@xmath72 .",
    "both satellites will measure the redshift for a similar number of galaxies and will obtain a comparable precision for the baryon acoustic oscillations derived angular diameter distances and hubble constant redshift evolution @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , due to their different observing strategy will allow cross - checks that will help to identify and eliminate systematics .",
    "the combination of both data sets will significantly improve the constraints on the dark energy parameters .",
    "many synergies will come from cross - correlating data from different observations for instance , euclid , wfirst and ska have similar scientific aims but will carry observations at different wavelengths .",
    "euclid and wfirst probe the low redshift universe , through weak lensing and galaxy clustering measurements .",
    "the ska has the potential to probe a higher redshift regime and a different range in scales of the matter power spectrum , which are linear scales rather than the quasi - non - linear scales to which euclid and wfirst will be sensitive .",
    "the combination of different observations will particularly sensitive to signatures of modified gravity .",
    "cross - correlation of different data sets will help to control systematics for the primary science .",
    "the ska , wfirst and euclid will be commissioned on similar timescales offering an exciting opportunity to exploit synergies between these facilities .",
