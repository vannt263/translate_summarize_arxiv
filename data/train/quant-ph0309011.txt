    "coherent control was initiated to steer a quantum system to a final objective via an external field @xcite .",
    "if the initial and final objective states are pure , the method can be termed state - to - state coherent control . by generalizing , the problem of steering simultaneously a _ set _ of initial pure states to a set of final states can be formulated .",
    "such a possibility has direct applicability in quantum computing where an algorithm implemented as a unitary transformation operating on a set of states has to be carried out irrespective of the input . in this application",
    "both input and output are encoded as a superposition of these states @xcite .",
    "to implement such a control , the external driving field that induces a pre - specified unitary transformation has to be found .",
    "different methods have been suggested for this task .",
    "some rely on factorizing the algorithm encoded as a unitary transformation , to a set of elementary gates and then finding a control solution for the elementary unitary evolution of a single gate @xcite .",
    "the inherent difficulty in such an approach is that in general the field addresses many levels simultaneously .",
    "therefore , when a particular single gate operation is carried out other levels are affected .",
    "this means that the ideal single gate unitary transformation has to be implemented so that all other possible transitions are avoided .",
    "the problem is simpler when each allowed transition is selectively addressable @xcite .",
    "however , in general the problem of undesired coupling has to be corrected .",
    "a specific solution has been suggested @xcite but a general solution is not known .",
    "the presence of a large number of levels coupled to the external driving field is especially relevant in the implementation of quantum computing in molecular systems @xcite .",
    "the use of optimal control theory ( oct ) has been proposed as a possible solution @xcite . in recent years",
    "oct for quantum systems @xcite has received considerable attention , leading to effective methods for obtaining the driving field which will induce a desired transition between preselected initial and final states .",
    "to address the control problem of inducing a particular unitary transformation the state - to - state oct has to be augmented .",
    "for example , if the unitary transformation is to relate the initial states @xmath4 with the final states @xmath5 , the state - to - state oct derives an optimal field @xmath6 for each pair of initial and final states @xmath7 .",
    "but the fields @xmath6 obtained are in general different , so that the evolution induced by @xmath6 is not appropriate for a different set of initial and final states . in order to implement a given unitary transformation a single field @xmath8 that relates simultaneously to all the relevant pairs",
    "@xmath7 is needed .",
    "two approaches have been suggested to generalize oct for unitary transformations .",
    "the first approach is formulated directly on the evolution operator @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach uses the simultaneous optimization of several state - to - state transitions @xcite .",
    "the present paper develops a comprehensive framework for constructing an oct solution for the unitary transformation .",

    "a crucial demand in quantum computing is obtaining high fidelity of the solution .",
    "the present oct scheme can be viewed as an iterative classical algorithm which finds a field that implements the quantum algorithm .",

    "[ se : conclusions ] results are discussed .",
    "the objective of the study is to devise a method to find the driving field that executes a unitary transformation on a subsystem embedded in a larger hilbert space .",
    "the unitary transformation is to be applied in a hilbert space @xmath9 of dimension @xmath10 , expanded by an orthonormal basis of states @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the selected unitary transformation is imposed on the subspace @xmath13 of @xmath14 levels of the system ( @xmath15 ) . in the context of quantum computation ,",
    "the @xmath14 levels correspond to the physical implementation of the qubit(s ) embedded in a larger system . the additional levels ( @xmath16 ) , considered as `` spurious levels '' ,",
    "are only indirectly involved in the target unitary transformation .    in any realistic implementation of quantum computing",
    ", `` spurious levels '' always exist .",
    "one reason is that the system is never completely isolated from the environment .",
    "in addition , the control levers , that in the present case is the dipole operator , connects directly only part of the primary levels .",
    "an example is the implementation of quantum computation using rovibronic molecular levels .",
    "the transition dipole connects two electronic surfaces @xcite .",
    "the primary states reside on one surface , so that raman - like transitions are used to implement the unitary transformation .",
    "the advantage of this setup is that the transitions frequencies between the electronic surfaces are in the visible region , for which the pulse shaping technology is well developed @xcite .",
    "other levels residing on both of the electronic surfaces become spurious in the sense that any leakage to them destroys the desired final result .",
    "however at intermediate times these levels constitute a temporary storage space which facilitates the execution of the transformation .",
    "the objective is to implement a selected unitary transformation in the relevant subspace @xmath17 at a given final time @xmath18 .",
    "the target unitary transformation is represented by an operator in the hilbert space of the primary system and is denoted by @xmath19 . for @xmath20 , the matrix representation of @xmath19 in the basis",
    "@xmath11 has two blocks of dimension @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the elements connecting these blocks are zero .",
    "this structure means that population is not transferred between the two subspaces at the target time @xmath18 , but can take place at intermediate times .",
    "only the @xmath21 block is relevant for the optimization procedure , while the other remains arbitrary .",
    "the dynamics of the system is generated by the hamiltonian @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the free hamiltonian , @xmath26 is the driving field and @xmath27 is a system operator describing the coupling between system and field . in the molecular systems",
    ", this coupling corresponds to the transition dipole operator and the driving field becomes radiation . in some cases more than one independent driving field can be considered .",
    "an example is when two components of the polarization of an electro - magnetic field are separately controlled @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the formalism in such a case is straightforward .",
    "the system dynamics is fully specified by the evolution operator @xmath28 .",
    "an optimal field @xmath29 induces the target unitary transformation @xmath19 at time @xmath18 when @xmath30 eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition ] ) implies a condition on only the @xmath21 block of the matrix representation of @xmath31 .",
    "the phase @xmath32 is introduced to point out that the target unitary transformation @xmath19 can be implemented only up to an arbitrary global phase .",
    "the phase @xmath33 can be decomposed into two terms , @xmath34 .",
    "the first , @xmath35 , originates from the arbitrary choice of the origin of the energy levels .",
    "formally , a term proportional to the identity operator can always be added to the hamiltonian . when the states @xmath36 correspond to the eigenstates of @xmath25 , the phase @xmath35 is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the energy of the level @xmath39 .",
    "the phase @xmath40 reflects the arbitrariness of the unitary transformation for the levels @xmath16 which are not part of the target .",
    "the method to determine the optimal field is based on maximizing a real functional of the field that depends on both the target unitary transformation and the evolution generated by the hamiltonian , fulfilling eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition ] ) .",
    "the problem of unitary transformation optimization is then reduced to a functional optimization .",
    "however different formulations of the problem can be made , leading to different functionals and then , in principle to different results . in the present context",
    "two different formulations have been proposed , one based on the evolution operator @xcite and the other on simultaneous @xmath14 state to state transitions @xcite .",
    "these formulations are closely related .",
    "a similar optimization procedure is described in sec .",
    "[ se : optimization ] .",
    "the optimization formulation is based on the definition of a complex functional @xmath41 that depends on the evolution operator at time @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the following functional is introduced : @xmath42 where the projection @xmath43 is used .",
    "@xmath44 denotes an orthonormal basis of the subspace @xmath13 .",
    "as @xmath19 is a unitary transformation in the relevant subspace , the functional @xmath41 is a complex number restricted to the interior of a circle in the complex plane of radius @xmath14 centered at the origin .",
    "the modulus of @xmath41 is equal to @xmath14 only for an optimal field fulfilling eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition ] ) .",
    "@xmath41 can then be interpreted as an indicator of the fidelity of the implementation on the target unitary transformation @xcite .",
    "when @xmath45 approaches @xmath14 , the transformation imposed by the field converges to the target objective .    since @xmath41 is complex , several different real functionals can be associated with it . in ref .",
    "@xcite the optimization of the real part of @xmath41 , or the imaginary part , or a linear combination of both was suggested to find the optimal field .",
    "it was found that all these possibilities show a similar performance .",
    "for this reason , the present paper employs the optimization of the real part chosen as a representative case .",
    "the functional is therefore defined as : @xmath46= -{\\rm re}\\left [ \\sum_{n=1}^{n}\\la n|{{\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\widehat{o}}}}}\\da{{\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\widehat{u}}}}}(t,0;\\epsilon)|n\\ra\\right]\\,.\\ ] ] the functional reaches its minimum value , @xmath47 , when the driving field induces the target unitary transformation but however with the additional condition that the phase term @xmath48 is equal to one .",
    "other functionals based on @xmath41 but without any condition on the phase can be defined . in this work the squared modulus of @xmath41 with a negative sign",
    "is studied : @xmath49 with minimum value @xmath50 for any field satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition ] ) .",
    "this formulation is based on the simultaneous optimization of @xmath14 transitions between a set of initial states @xmath51 and the corresponding final states @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) @xcite . for this purpose",
    "the following functional is defined , @xmath54 is defined as the sum of overlaps at the final time @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter @xmath55 is a positive real number and its maximum value , @xmath14 , is reached when all the initial states @xmath56 are driven by the field to the final target states @xmath57 , except for a possible arbitrary phase associated with each transition .",
    "the arbitrariness of these phases implies that the set of initial states @xmath56 must be chosen carefully . in order to account for all the possible transitions , the states @xmath56 have to faithfully represent all the relevant subspace @xmath13 i.e. constitute a complete basis set .",
    "however , a choice of an orthonormal basis could produce undesired results .",
    "for example , the ambiguity of using an orthonormal basis @xmath44 in the relevant subspace and an arbitrary unitary transformation @xmath58 , diagonal in that basis .",
    "the product @xmath59 will also be a unitary transformation .",
    "if @xmath60 and @xmath61 are fields that generate @xmath19 and @xmath59 at time @xmath18 respectively , they both will have the same fidelity @xmath55 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes that @xmath55 was evaluated using an orthonormal basis .",
    "then any algorithm based on optimizing @xmath55 that uses an orthonormal basis could find a solution for the field corresponding to the implementation of an arbitrary unitary transformations of the form @xmath59 .",
    "( @xmath19 is a particular case when @xmath58 is the identity operator ) .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that @xmath55 is only sensitive to the overlap of each pair of initial @xmath56 and final @xmath57 states , leaving undetermined the relative phases between them . for the optimization procedure to succeed",
    "a careful choice of the initial set of states is necessary .",
    "a simple solution is to compose the last @xmath14 state as a superposition of all states in the basis @xmath64 , and to keep as is the first @xmath65 states of an orthonormal basis .",
    "for this set of states , the maximum condition is achieved only when the field induces the target unitary transformation up to a possible global phase .    to summarize the functional @xmath66 in",
