    "recently , superdeformed ( sd ) rotational bands have been discovered in @xmath1ar , @xmath4ca and @xmath5ti @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting new features of them is that they are built on excited @xmath6 states and observed up to high spin , in contrast to the sd bands in heavier mass regions where low - spin portions of them are unknown in almost all cases @xcite .",
    "these excited @xmath6 states may be associated with multiparticle - multihole excitations from the spherical closed shells , so that we can hope to learn from such data detailed relationships between spherical shell model and sd configurations . for the mass @xmath730 - 50 region , although existence of a sd band in @xmath0s with the sd magic number @xmath8 has been expected for a long time @xcite , it has not yet been observed and remains as a great challenge @xcite .    in this paper , as a continuation of the systematic theoretical search @xcite for sd bands in the mass @xmath730 - 50 region by means of the cranked skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) method@xcite , we would like to suggest that , in addition to @xmath0s , the neutron - rich nucleus @xmath1s and the nuclei , @xmath2s and @xmath3s , which are situated close to the neutron - drip line@xcite , are also good candidates for finding sd rotational bands in sulfur isotopes .",
    "the appearance of the sd band in @xmath1s is suggested in connection with the sd shell structure at @xmath9 characterizing the observed sd band in @xmath4ca .",
    "the drip - line nuclei , @xmath2s and @xmath3s , are expected to constitute a new `` sd doubly closed '' region associated with the sd magic numbers , @xmath10 for protons and @xmath11 for neutrons .",
    "an interesting theoretical subject for the sd bands in nuclei near the neutron drip line is to understand deformation properties of neutron skins .",
    "the calculated density distributions indeed exhibit superdeformed neutron skins .",
    "the calculation has been carried out with the use of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) , cartesian coordinate - mesh representation without imposing any symmetry restriction@xcite . in parallel , we also carry out the standard calculations @xcite imposing reflection symmetries . by comparing the symmetry restricted and unrestricted calculations",
    ", we can examine the stability of the sd solutions of the shf equations against reflection - asymmetric deformations . in this way",
    ", we have found several cases where the sd minima obtained in the symmetry - restricted calculations are in fact unstable with respect to the reflection - asymmetric deformations . in general , the sd states are rather soft against reflection - asymmetric deformations , so that we need careful study about the stabilities of them against various kinds of deformation breaking the reflection symmetries .    after a brief account of the cranked shf calculational procedure in section  2 , we present and discuss results of the calculation in section  3 , and give conclusions in section  4 .",
    "we shall present deformation energy curves for sulfur isotopes from @xmath0s to @xmath3s , and focus our attention on properties of rotational bands built on the sd @xmath6 states , stabilities of the sd local minima against the reflection - asymmetric deformations , and density distributions of the sd states .",
    "a preliminary version of this work was reported in @xcite .",
    "since the cranked shf method in the 3d coordinate - mesh representation is well known@xcite , we here give only a minimum description about the computational procedure actually adopted .",
    "for a recent comprehensive review on selfconsistent mean - field models for nuclear structure , see ref .",
    "@xcite . the cranked shf equation for a system uniformly rotating about the @xmath12-axis",
    "is given by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 mean the hamiltonian with the skyrme interaction , the rotational frequency and the @xmath12-component of angular momentum , respectively , and the bracket denotes the expectation value with respect to a slater determinantal state .",
    "we solve the cranked shf equation by means of the imaginary - time evolution technique@xcite in the 3d cartesian - mesh representation .",
    "the algorithm of numerical calculation is the standard one @xcite , except that we allow for both reflection- and axial - symmetry breakings . in this case",
    ", it is important to accurately fulfill the center - of - mass and principal - axis conditions .",
    "this is done by means of the constrained hf procedure@xcite .",
    "we solved these equations inside the sphere with radius @xmath17=10  fm and mesh size @xmath18=1  fm , starting with various initial configurations .",
    "the accuracy for evaluating deformation energies with this mesh size was carefully checked by tajima@xcite and was found to be quite satisfactory .",
    "when we make a detailed analysis of density distributions , however , we use a smaller mesh size of @xmath19 fm .",
    "in addition to the symmetry - unrestricted cranked shf calculation , we also carry out symmetry - restricted calculations imposing reflection symmetries about the @xmath20- , @xmath21- and @xmath22-planes .",
    "below we call these symmetry - unrestricted and -restricted cranked shf versions `` unrestricted '' and `` restricted '' ones , respectively",
    ".    solutions of the cranked shf equation give local minima in the deformation energy surface . in order to explore the deformation energy surface around these minima and draw deformation energy curves as functions of deformation parameters , we carry out the constrained hf procedure with relevant constraining operators@xcite .",
    "for the skyrme interaction , we adopt the widely used three versions ; siii  @xcite , skm@xmath23@xcite and sly4  @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows deformation energy curves for sulfur isotopes from @xmath0s to @xmath3s obtained with the use of the siii interaction .",
    "solid lines with and without filled circles represent the results obtained by the unrestricted and restricted versions , respectively .",
    "the result of calculation indicates that the sd minima ( with the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath24 ) appear in the neutron - rich nucleus @xmath1s and the drip - line nuclei , @xmath2s and @xmath3s , in addition to the well - known case of @xmath0s . as seen in figs .  2 and 3 ,",
    "similar results are obtained for the skm@xmath23 and sly4 interactions , except that the sd states in @xmath2s is unstable against the reflection - asymmetric deformation for the sly4 interaction ( see subsection 3.3 ) .    as discussed in refs.@xcite",
    ", the sd local minimum in @xmath0s corresponds to the doubly closed shell configuration with respect to the sd magic number @xmath25 and involves two protons and two neutrons in the down - sloping single - particle levels originating from the @xmath26 shell .",
    "the sd local minimum in @xmath1s results from the coherent combination of the sd magic number , @xmath10 , and the neutron shell effects occurring at large deformation for @xmath9 .",
    "the latter shell effect has been confirmed recently by the discovery of the sd rotation band in @xmath4ca @xcite .",
    "the sd shell gap at @xmath9 is associated with the 4p-4h excitation from below the @xmath9 spherical closed shell to the @xmath26 shell . focusing our attention on the occupation numbers of such high-@xmath27 shells and distinguishing protons(@xmath28 ) and neutrons(@xmath29 ) , these sd configurations in @xmath0s and @xmath1s are denoted in figs .",
    "1 - 3 as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the sd local minima in the drip - line nuclei , @xmath2s and @xmath3s , result from the coherent combination of the proton sd shell effect and the neutron shell effects occurring at superdeformation for @xmath3232 - 34 .",
    "the neutron configurations in these sd states are similar to those in the known sd bands in @xmath33zn and @xmath34zn associated with the sd magic numbers @xmath3230 - 32@xcite .",
    "we find that the sd shell effect is strong also for @xmath35 in the sulfur isotopes under consideration , while the sd local minimum in @xmath36s with @xmath37 is unstable against the reflection - asymmetric deformation ( see subsection 3.3 ) . in the drip - line nuclei @xmath2s and @xmath3s ,",
    "the @xmath26 shell is fully occupied even in the spherical limit and the sd configurations involve neutron excitations from the @xmath38-shell to the @xmath39 shell .",
    "as before , focusing our attention on the occupation numbers of the high-@xmath27 shells , let us use the notation @xmath40 for a configuration in which single - particle levels originating from the @xmath26 and @xmath39 shell are occupied by @xmath41 protons and @xmath42 neutrons , respectively",
    ". with such notations , the sd local minima in @xmath2s and @xmath3s correspond to the @xmath43 , and @xmath44 configurations , respectively .",
    "the appearance of the sd minimum in @xmath1s suggests that we can expect a sd band associated with the same neutron configuration to appear also in the @xmath9 isotone , @xmath45ar , situated between @xmath1s and @xmath4ca .",
    "we examined this point and the result is shown in fig .",
    "we find that the two local minima associated with the configurations @xmath30 and @xmath31 compete in energy and their relative energy differs for different versions of the skyrme interaction : as clearly seen in the deformation - energy curves obtained by the symmetry - restricted calculations , the former with smaller @xmath46 is slightly lower for skm@xmath23 and sly4 while the latter with larger @xmath46 is slightly lower for siii .",
    "counting both protons and neutrons , these local minima respectively correspond to the 4p-6h and 6p-8h configurations with respect to the spherical doubly closed shell of @xmath4ca .",
    "as we discussed in the previous papers@xcite , the two configurations can mix each other in the crossing region through the reflection - symmetry breaking components in the mean field . specifically , around the crossing point between the down - sloping @xmath47 $ ] level ( coming from the @xmath26 shell ) and the up - sloping @xmath48 $ ] level ( coming from the @xmath49 shell below the @xmath9 spherical magic number ) , the @xmath50-type non - axial octupole deformation is generated , and they mix each other through this component of the mean field ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "note that the matrix element of the operator @xmath50 between the two levels satisfies the selection rules , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , for the asymptotic quantum numbers @xmath53 and @xmath54 . as a result of this mixing ,",
    "the deformation - energy curve becomes rather flat in the symmetry - unrestricted calculation .",
    "recently , the sd band corresponding to the 4p-6h configuration was found in experiment@xcite .",
    "the data suggest significant competition between different configurations , which requires further analysis of shape fluctuation dynamics by going beyond the static mean - field approximation .",
    "let us focus our attention on the sd local minima shown in figs .  1 - 3 , and investigate properties of the rotational bands built on them .",
    "excitation energies of these sd rotational bands are plotted in fig .  6 as functions of angular momentum .",
    "these rotational bands are calculated by cranking each shf solution ( the sd local minima in figs .  1 - 3 ) and following the same configuration with increasing value of @xmath15 until the point where we can not clearly identify the continuation of the same configuration any more .",
    "thus , the highest values of angular momentum in this figure does not necessarily indicate the band - termination points but merely suggest that drastic changes in their microscopic structure take place around there .",
    "different slopes with respect to the angular momentum between @xmath1s and @xmath3s can be easily understood in terms of the well known scaling factor @xmath55 for the rigid - body moment of inertia .",
    "this point can be confirmed in fig .  7 which displays the angular momentum @xmath56 , the kinematical and dynamical moments of inertia , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and the rigid - body moments of inertia @xmath59 as functions of the rotational frequency @xmath15 .",
    "we see that the calculated moments of inertia are slightly larger than the rigid - body values at @xmath60 , and smoothly decrease as @xmath15 increases until @xmath612.5 and 1.8 mev@xmath62 for @xmath63s and @xmath3s , respectively .",
    "the result calculated with the sly4 interaction is shown here , but we obtained similar results also with the siii and skm@xmath23 interactions .",
    "calculated quadrupole deformation parameters @xmath64 are displayed in the upper portion of fig .",
    "we see that the @xmath46 values slowly decrease while the axial - asymmetry parameters @xmath65 gradually increase with increasing angular momentum for all cases of @xmath0s , @xmath1s and @xmath3s .",
    "the variations are rather mild in the range of angular momentum shown in this figure .",
    "single - particle energy diagrams ( routhians ) for these sd bands are displayed in fig .",
    "8 as functions of the rotational frequency @xmath15 .",
    "this figure indicates that level crossings take place in @xmath1s and @xmath3s if we further increase the angular momentum .",
    "let us examine stabilities of the sd local minimum against both the axially symmetric and asymmetric octupole deformation ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "figure 9 presents deformation energy curves as functions of the octupole deformation parameters @xmath67 for fixed quadrupole deformation parameters ( the equilibrium value of @xmath46 at the sd minimum in each nucleus and @xmath68 ) .",
    "the computation was carried out by means of the constrained hf procedure with the use of the siii , skm@xmath23 , and sly4 interactions .",
    "the result of calculation clearly indicates that the sd states in @xmath0s , @xmath1s and @xmath3s are stable against the octupole deformations and that they are softer for @xmath69 with lower values of @xmath70 ( i.e. , for @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) , irrespective of the skyrme interactions used .",
    "we obtaind a similar result also for @xmath2s ( but omitted in this figure ) .",
    "although the sd minima in @xmath0s , @xmath1s and @xmath3s are stable with respect to @xmath67 , we found several cases where the sd minima obtained in the symmetry - restricted calculations become unstable when we allow for reflection - asymmetric deformations of a more general type .",
    "as a first example , let us discuss the sd minimum in @xmath36s which appears in the restricted calculation ( see figs .  1 - 3 ) . in this case",
    ", the coupling between the down - sloping @xmath73 $ ] level ( associated with the @xmath26 shell ) and the up - sloping @xmath74 $ ] level ( stemming from the @xmath75 shell ) takes place in the proton configuration , when we allow for the breaking of both the axial and reflection symmetries .",
    "thus , the sd configuration @xmath43 mixes with the @xmath76 configuration ( which lacks the proton excitation to the @xmath26 shell and has a smaller equilibrium value of @xmath46 ) . as a consequence of this mixing",
    ", the barrier between the two configurations disappears and the sd minimum becomes unstable in the unrestricted calculations ( see figs .  1 - 3 ) .",
    "note that the difference @xmath77 in the asymptotic quantum number @xmath53 between the two single - particle levels , @xmath73 $ ] and @xmath74 $ ] , is three , so that they can not be mixed by the octupole operator @xmath78 which transfers the asymptotic quantum numbers @xmath53 and @xmath54 by @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "thus , this mixing may be associated with the reflection - asymmetric deformation of a more higher order like @xmath81 .    as a second example , we take up the sd minimum in @xmath2s . in this case ,",
    "two configurations , @xmath43 and @xmath44 compete in energy and their relative energy differs for different versions of the skyrme interaction ( see figs .  1 - 3 ) .",
    "when we allow for the breaking of both the axial and reflection symmetries , the coupling between the down - sloping @xmath82 $ ] level ( associated with the @xmath39 shell ) and the @xmath83 $ ] level in the @xmath38 shell takes place in the neutron configuration , so that they mix each other .",
    "note that the @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath83 $ ] levels satisfy the selection rules , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , for the matrix elements of the octupole operator @xmath50 . in the calculation with the sly4 interaction , since the former configuration with smaller @xmath46",
    "is situated slightly lower in energy than the latter , the barrier between the two configurations disappears as a result of this mixing .",
    "this mixing effect in conjunction with that mentioned above for the @xmath43 configuration in @xmath36s deteriorates the sd minimum for the sly4 case .",
    "the above examples indicate detailed microscopic mechanisms within the mean - field theory how the stability of the sd local minimum is determined by relative energies between the neighboring configurations and their mixing properties .",
    "figure 10 displays the neutron and proton density profiles for the sd states in @xmath0s , @xmath1s and @xmath3s calculated with the use of the sly4 interaction .",
    "we obtained similar results also for siii and skm@xmath23 . in this figure , equi - density lines with 50% and 1% of the central density in the @xmath20- and @xmath21-planes are drawn for the sd bands at @xmath84 and at high spins .",
