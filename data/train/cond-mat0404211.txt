    "carbon nanotubes ( cns ) are graphene sheets rolled - up into cylinders of approximately one nanometer in diameter .",
    "extensive work carried out worldwide in recent years has revealed the intriguing physical properties of these novel molecular scale wires  @xcite .",
    "nanotubes have been shown to be useful for miniaturized electronic , mechanical , electromechanical , chemical and scanning probe devices and materials for macroscopic composites  @xcite .",
    "important is that their intrinsic properties may be substantially modified in a controllable way by doping with extrinsic impurity atoms , molecules and compounds  @xcite .",
    "recent successful experiments on encapsulation of single atoms into single - wall cns  @xcite and their intercalation into single - wall cn bundles  @xcite as well as the theory of spontaneous decay in such systems  @xcite stimulate an in - depth analysis of atom - cn van der waals ( vdw ) interactions .",
    "the relative density of photonic states ( dos ) near a cn effectively increases due to the presence of additional surface photonic states coupled with cn electronic quasiparticle excitations  @xcite .",
    "this causes an atom - vacuum - field coupling constant ( which is proportional to the photonic dos ) to be very sensitive to an atom - cn - surface distance .",
    "in particular  @xcite , when the atom is close enough to the cn surface and the atomic transition frequency is in the vicinity of the resonance of the photonic dos , the system shows _",
    "strong _ atom - vacuum - field coupling giving rise to rearrangement ( `` dressing '' ) of atomic levels by vacuum - field interaction .",
    "if the atom moves away from the cn surface , the atom - field coupling strength decreases , smoothly approaching the weak coupling regime at large atom - surface distances since the role of surface photonic states diminishes causing the relative density of photonic states to decrease .",
    "this suggests strictly _ nonlinear _ atom - field coupling and a _ primary _ role of the distance - dependent ( local ) photonic dos in the vicinity of the cn , so that vacuum - qed - based vdw interaction models as well as those based upon the linear response theory ( see  @xcite for a review ) are in general inapplicable for an atom in a close vicinity of a carbon nanotube .    to give this issue a proper consideration ,",
    "we have developed a simple quantum mechanical approach to the vdw energy calculation of a ( two - level ) atomic system in the vicinity of an infinitely long single - wall cn .",
    "the approach is based upon the perturbation theory for degenerate atomic levels ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , thereby allowing one to account for both strong and weak atom - vacuum - field coupling regimes . in describing the atom - field interaction",
    ", we follow a unified macroscopic qed formalism developed for dispersing and absorbing media in ref .",
    "@xcite and adapted for an atom near a cn in refs .",
    "the formalism generalizes the standard macroscopic qed normal - mode technique by representing mode expansion in terms of a green tensor of the ( operator ) maxwell equations in which material dispersion and absorbtion are automatically included . in more detail ,",
    "the fourier - images of electric and magnetic fields are considered as quantum mechanical observables of corresponding electric and magnetic field operators .",
    "the latter ones satisfy the fourier - domain operator maxwell equations modified by the presence of a  so - called operator noise current written in terms of a bosonic field operator and an imaginary dielectric permittivity .",
    "this operator is responsible for correct commutation relations of the electric and magnetic field operators in the presence of medium - induced absorbtion .",
    "the electric and magnetic field operators are then expressed in terms of a continuum set of operator bosonic fields by means of the convolution of the operator noise current with the electromagnetic field green tensor of the system .",
    "the bosonic field operators create and annihilate single - quantum electromagnetic medium excitations .",
    "they are defined by their commutation relations and play the role of the fundamental dynamical variables in terms of which the hamiltonian of the composed system `` electromagnetic field + dissipative medium '' is written in a standard secondly quantized form .    using the approach summarized above , we derive an integral equation for the vdw energy of a two - level atomic system near a cn .",
    "the equation is represented in terms of the local photonic dos and is valid for both strong and weak atom - field coupling . by solving it numerically ,",
    "we demonstrate the inapplicability of weak - coupling - based vdw interaction models in a close vicinity of the cn .",

    "these two limiting cases are obtained by putting @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , in the denominator of the second term .",
    "the former is nothing but a degeneracy condition of the unperturbed atomic levels due to the atom - field interaction , taking place at small atom - cn - surface distances when the local photonic dos is large enough .",

    "this result is slightly `` improved '' compared with those obtained from various weak - coupling - based models discussed in the literature ( see  @xcite and refs . therein ) since a part of the atom - field interaction is included in the unperturbed hamiltonian via the renormalized transition frequency .",
    "using eq .  ( [ evw ] ) , we have simulated the vdw energy of the atom outside the ( 9,0 ) cn .",
    "the local photonic dos functions @xmath76 were computed in the same manner as it was done in ref .",

    "figure  [ fig1](a ) shows the transverse local photonic dos , as a typical example , for the atom located at several distances from the cn surface .",
    "the dos function is seen to increase with decreasing the atom - cn - surface distance , representing the increase of the atom - field coupling strength as the atom approaches the nanotube surface  @xcite .",
    "the vertical dashed lines indicate the bare atomic transitions frequencies @xmath79 for which the vdw energies shown in figure  [ fig1](b ) were calculated .",
    "the frequencies are typical for heavy hydrogen - like atoms such as cs for which @xmath79 may be estimated from its first ionization potential  @xcite to be @xmath80 ( the factor @xmath81 comes from the lyman series of  h ) , or less for highly excited rydberg states .    in figure  [ fig1](b ) , the vdw energies given by exact numerical solutions of eq .

    "are compared with those obtained from the same equation within the weak and strong coupling approximations . at small atom - cn - surface distances ,",
    "the exact solutions are seen to be fairly well reproduced by those obtained in the strong coupling approximation , clearly indicating the strong atom - vacuum - field coupling regime in a close vicinity of the nanotube surface .",
    "the deviation from the strong coupling approximation increases with @xmath79 , that is easily explicable since the degeneracy condition of the unperturbed atomic levels is more difficult to reach for larger interlevel separations . as the atom moves away from the cn surface ,",
    "the exact solutions deviate from the strong coupling solutions and approach those given by the weak coupling approximation , indicating the reduction of the atom - field coupling strength with raising the atom - surface distance .",
    "the weak - coupling solutions are seen to be divergent close to the nanotube surface as it should be because of the degeneracy of the unperturbed ( bare ) atomic levels in this region .    to conclude , we have investigated vdw interactions of a two - level atomic system near a single - wall cn within the unified qed approach accounting for both strong and weak atom - vacuum - field coupling .",
    "we have demonstrated the inapplicability of weak - coupling - based vdw interaction models in a close vicinity of the nanotube surface where the local photonic dos effectively increases giving rise to atom - field coupling enhancement followed by the degeneracy and rearrangement ( `` dressing '' ) of bare atomic levels .",
