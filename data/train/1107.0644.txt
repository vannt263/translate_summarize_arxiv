    "galaxies are fundamental building blocks of our universe , and our knowledge of their distribution , structure and dynamics is closely tied to our general understanding of structure growth .",
    "so - called scaling relations , that is correlations between well - defined and easily measurable galaxy properties , have always been central to our understanding of nearby galaxies . with high redshift studies now routine ,",
    "scaling relations are more useful than ever , allowing us to probe the evolution of galaxy populations over a large range of lookback times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the colour - magnitude relation ( cmr ) was already recognised in the sixties and seventies @xcite and has served as an important benchmark for theories of galaxy formation and evolution since ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main drivers are thought to be galaxy metallicity , which causes more metal rich galaxies to be redder , and age , causing younger galaxies to be bluer .",
    "galaxies devoid of star formation are thought to populate the red sequence , while star - forming galaxies lie in the blue cloud ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the dichotomy in the distribution of galaxies in this relation has opened a very productive avenue of research to unravel the epoch of galaxy assembly ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since its discovery @xcite , the fundamental plane ( fp ) has been one of the most studied relations in the literature . given its tightness , like many other scaling relations the fp was quickly envisaged as a distance estimator as well as a correlation to understand how galaxies form and evolve ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is widely recognised that the fp is a manifestation of the virial theorem for self - gravitating systems averaged over space and time with physical quantities total mass , velocity dispersion , and gravitational radius replaced by the observables mean effective surface brightness ( @xmath5 ) , effective ( half - light ) radius ( @xmath4 ) , and stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath6 ) . since velocity dispersion and surface brightness are distance - independent quantities , contrary to effective radius , it is common to express the fp as @xmath7@xmath4@xmath8@xmath5@xmath9 , to separate distance - errors from others .",
    "if galaxies were homologous with constant total mass - to - light ratios , the fp would be equivalent to the virial plane and be infinitely thin , with slopes @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( in the notation used here ) . by studying the intrinsic scatter around the fp ,",
    "one can study how galaxy properties differ within the observed sample .",
    "some projections of the fp , known earlier in time , have also been widely studied .",
    "@xcite found that the surface brightness density ( i.e. mean surface brightness ) of a galaxy changes as a function of its size . this relation is usually known as the kormendy relation ( hereafter kr ) .",
    "the correlation is such that larger galaxies have lower surface brightness densities , compared to their smaller counterparts .",
    "the size - luminosity relation ( slr ) is widely used to establish the size evolution of galaxies as a function of redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , the last projection of the fp that we consider in this paper is the faber - jackson relation ( @xcite ; hereafter fjr ) , which relates the luminosity of a galaxy to its stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "the highest quality and best understood scaling relations in the optical / near - infrared are the ones for early - type galaxies .",
    "this is because observationally they are much simpler than spirals , with less complicated star formation histories , and less extinction by dust , and thus tighter scaling relations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is for that reason that often the two groups are treated separately in physically similar relations : the prime example being the relations between the central stellar velocity dispersion and absolute luminosity of elliptical galaxies ( fjr ) , and the rotation velocity and absolute luminosity of disc galaxies @xcite . in an attempt to unify properties of these two groups ,",
    "spiral galaxies are usually studied in terms of their bulge and disc properties .",
    "the resemblance of bulges to ellipticals has lead to their inclusion in the scaling relations of early - type systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although they often reveal a much larger scatter and show , on average , an offset with respect to the relations of early - type galaxies . while this might not be surprising due to the mentioned effects of ( younger ) stellar populations and dust , part of the reason might also be the ( often far from trivial ) decoupling of the bulge from the disc .",
    "these scaling relations exist for galaxy parameters at various radii .",
    "while photometric quantities inside one effective radius are easy to measure , the inherent limitations of traditional ( single - aperture or long - slit ) spectrographs have restricted the measurement of the stellar velocity dispersion to the central regions of galaxies .",
    "for instance , papers based on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) use velocity dispersions that have been determined from central galaxy apertures , corrected to effective velocity dispersions using standard aperture corrections . in this paper",
    "we follow the approach of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper iv ) and make use of the panoramic capabilities of ` sauron `  to measure velocity dispersions in circular apertures going out to an effective radius ( @xmath2 ) , and present scaling relations for which all the parameters are measured within the same aperture .",
    "this method offers the interesting possibility of presenting the spiral sa galaxies in the same relations as early - type e / s0 galaxies .",
    "when measuring @xmath2from the integrated galaxy spectrum galaxy broadening can be caused by intrinsic velocity dispersions , or by galaxy rotation . despite this uncertainty , @xmath2  will still be a measure of the mass in a galaxy inside @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , these velocity dispersions will not be affected by the presence of central discs , which often show low velocity dispersions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since @xmath4  for most of our sa galaxies is much larger than the radius inside which the galaxy bulge dominates , the scaling relations will give us information about both the bulges and the inner discs of the sa galaxies .",
    "this paper tends to investigate both issues by combining photometry with integral - field spectroscopy for a representative sample of e to sa galaxies , treated in a consistent manner with a homogeneous database and methods .",
    "the importance of this last point should not be overlooked , as supposedly standard parameters can vary greatly when measured by different groups .",
    "an example of this is provided by the measurement of nuclear cusp slopes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with these goals in mind ,",
    "we have carried out an optical spectroscopic survey of @xmath12 representative nearby e / s0 galaxies and sa galaxies to one @xmath4 , using the custom - designed panoramic integral - field spectrograph ` sauron `  mounted on the william herschel telescope , la palma ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the ` sauron `  representative sample was chosen to populate uniformly @xmath13@xmath14 planes , equally divided between cluster and field objects ( * ? ? ?",

    "the work in this paper builds on previous results of our survey on scaling relations in other wavelength domains ( paper iv ; @xcite , hereafter paper xiii ) .",
    "the reader is referred to other papers of the ` sauron `  survey for results on the stellar kinematics @xcite and kinematic classification @xcite of early - type galaxies and their stellar populations @xcite and on the kinematics @xcite and population of early spirals @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to them as paper iii , ix , x , vi , xv , xvii , vii and xi respectively.-2    we present in this paper homogeneous ground - based @xmath0-band and _ spitzer _ 3.6@xmath1m - band imaging observations of the @xmath15 elliptical e , @xmath15 lenticular s0 and 24 spiral sa galaxies of the ` sauron `  representative sample .",

    "tables with the measured quantities are presented in appendix  [ app : photab].-2    throughout the paper we adopt the _ wmap _ ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) cosmological parameters for the hubble constant , the matter density and the cosmological constant , of respectively @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite , although these parameters only have a small effect on the physical scales of the galaxies due to their proximity .",
    "the ` sauron `  sample is designed to be representative of the population of early - type galaxies in the nearby universe . by construction , e , s0 and",
    "sa galaxies were selected in equal numbers ( 24 in each group ) to populate uniformly the absolute magnitude versus ellipticity diagram . within each morphological class , galaxies were chosen to sample the field and cluster environments equally ( 12 in the field and 12 in clusters ) .",
    "the sample therefore consists of 72 galaxies .",
    "the basis for the sample selection was the lyon / meudon extragalactic database ( leda ; @xcite ) .    besides the astrophysically - motivated criteria ,",
    "the instrument specifications impose further constraints on the sample selection : @xmath19 to avoid instrument flexure ; @xmath20  to ensure that all the lines of interest are in the observed spectral range ; m@xmath21 mag to ensure that all central velocity dispersions ( above 75 ) can be measured ; @xmath22 to avoid crowded fields and large galactic extinctions .",
    "these restrictions make the ` sauron `  set a representative but incomplete luminosity- and volume - limited sample of galaxies ( see paper ii ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : phot ] we show some of the main properties of the ` sauron`sample in the @xmath0- and @xmath23m - bands .",
    "the photometric quantities have been derived as outlined in section  [ sec : aper_phot ] .",
    "the field - of - view ( fov ) for a single pointing of the ` sauron `  integral - field unit ( ifu ) is @xmath24 arcsec@xmath25 , and therefore , as shown in the figure , covers up to one effective ( half - light ) radius @xmath4   for most of our galaxies .",
    "larger galaxies were usually mosaiced with several ` sauron `  pointings to reach the effective radius .",
    "as intended in our sample selection , our galaxies uniformly populate the desired absolute magnitude range above the selection cut .",
    "while figure  [ fig : phot ] illustrates the limits in size , mean surface brightness and luminosity of our sample , it still lacks information about potential biases ( other than the luminosity ) and the level of completeness of our sample . preliminary checks with larger , more complete samples of early - type galaxies ( @xcite , hereafter b03 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) reveal that our ` sauron `  representative sample covers rather well the parameter space defined by these three photometric indicators for @xmath5@xmath2621 mag arcsec@xmath27 at @xmath0-band .",
    "we illustrate this using the @xmath28-band catalogue of b03 as a comparison sample in  [ sec : scaling ] and  [ sec : fp ] .",
    "this dataset consists of around 9000 early - type galaxies up to redshift 0.3 with stellar velocity dispersions above 70 .",
    "part of the imaging data were obtained at the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope of the mdm observatory located on kitt peak , arizona , over 5 observing runs totalling @xmath29 nights : 2003 march 25april 6 , 2003 october 27november 2 , 2004 february 1825 , 2005 april 1117 and 2005",
    "november 26 .",
    "the entire ` sauron `  representative sample was observed ( paper ii ) .",
    "the thin @xmath30  pix@xmath25 backside - illuminated site ` echelle ' ccd was used , and an additional @xmath31 column virtual overscan region was simultaneously obtained with every frame . in direct imaging mode ( @xmath32 ) , this yields pixels of @xmath33 and a @xmath34 field - of - view , ensuring proper sampling of the seeing and plenty of sky around the targets for sky subtraction .",
    "the seeing was typically @xmath35 to @xmath36 and no observation with a seeing above @xmath37 was used .",
    "the readout noise and gain were typically @xmath38  e@xmath39 and @xmath40  e@xmath39  adu@xmath41 .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) f555w and f814w filters were used , similar to the cousins @xmath0 and @xmath42 optical filters .",
    "long non - photometric exposures were obtained during most nights . to reach a sufficient depth and allow correction of ccd defects when combining the images , our stated goal was to acquire at least three long offset exposures in each filter for every object .",
    "exposure times for individual long exposures were typically @xmath43  s in f555w , although we adjusted both the exposure times and the number of exposures based on weather conditions . to internally calibrate the photometry",
    ", we also acquired a short ( @xmath44  s ) exposure of every object during the few truly photometric nights .",
    "the data reduction of the mdm images was carried out using standard procedures in iraf .",
    "the bias was subtracted in two steps .",
    "first , the average of the overscan region of each frame was subtracted from each column .",
    "second , a ` master ' bias was subtracted from every frame . since",
    "the bias was found to be stable , we used a run - wide average of ( overscan - subtracted ) bias frames obtained at the beginning and end of each night .",
    "dark current was found to be non - negligible and was subtracted using a ` master ' dark , again resulting from a run - wide average of dark frames obtained at night during bad weather conditions .",
    "all galaxy and standard star exposures were then divided by a ` master ' flatfield frame , resulting from an average of twilight frames obtained in each filter .",
    "surprisingly , the flatfields were found to vary from night to night by up to @xmath45 per cent , so a night average was used whenever possible .",
    "this is not a major limitation , however , as we are mostly interested in azimuthally - averaged quantities ( see   [ sec : aper_phot ] ) .",
    "all images of a given galaxy in each filter were registered using the _ match _ routine by michael richmond ( available at http://spiff.rit.edu/match/ ) , based on the algorithm by @xcite .",
    "star lists were obtained using _ sextractor _ @xcite .",
    "position uncertainties in the registered images were typically smaller than a tenth of a pixel .",
    "individual images were then sky subtracted and combined using a sigma clipping algorithm and proper scaling . independently of the photometric calibration ,",
    "the short exposures are essential in the central region of many objects , where long exposures are often saturated .",
    "the combined images were flux calibrated using the photometric transformations determined , night by night , in the way explained below .",
    "we estimate the limiting surface brightness of our @xmath0-band data ( @xmath4625 mag arcsec@xmath27 ) as the surface brightness level 1@xmath6 above the uncertainties in the determination of the sky.-2      during the reduction of the data a few important issues were identified in the f814w images .",
    "first , the images suffered from fringing at the @xmath47@xmath45 per cent level . since no nighttime exposure of blank fields was obtained , we attempted to devise an alternative correction from standard star exposures , and also from the galaxies exposures themselves .",
    "standard star images , however , proved to have too low signal - to - noise ratios @xmath48 , while median - combined galaxy exposures failed to remove all the galaxy signal , as most of our targets cover a substantial fraction of the field - of - view .",
    "we therefore could not correct for the fringing .",
    "second , and most importantly , stars in the f814w long - exposure images showed a faint , but extended halo around them .",
    "this was mostly noticeable in the saturated stars .",
    "this problem , commonly termed red halo point spread function ( psf) , is due to the use of thinned ccds together with other effects related to the aging of the telescope coating ( see @xcite for an in - depth study on the issue ) .",
    "these cause the psf in the f814w filter to extend to well over 100 arcsec ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "although one could in principle devise a correction , it would be rather uncertain . since this issue will affect any measurement with this filter , we deemed the f814w dataset unreliable and discarded it from our analysis .",
    "the effective radii presented in previous papers of the ` sauron `  series ( papers iv , vi , ix , x , @xcite ) were computed from combined f814w hst and mdm images before we identified this issue .",
    "nevertheless , the values calculated there appear to be 1% smaller than the ones measured here in the @xmath0-band ( thus consistent with the presence of colour gradients ) and with a scatter implying a small error of 8% .",
    "note that this issue has no effect on any of the conclusions in those papers and has a very small effect on the quantities derived from our integral - field data , which have been updated in paper xv and subsequent papers of the ` sauron `   series .",
    "during photometric nights , in addition to galaxies , we also performed repeated observations of stellar fields including standard stars from @xcite , covering a range of apparent magnitudes and colours ; for many fields , the observations were repeated at the beginning , in the middle and at the end of the night , in order to also calibrate the dependence on airmass . in total , we acquired 84 stellar fields , with several ( 3 to @xmath46 10 ) standard stars in each one .",
    "the aim was to calibrate the data using photometric solutions of the following form : @xmath49    where @xmath50 are the standard magnitudes from @xcite , @xmath51 is the instrumental magnitude , @xmath52 the photometric zero - point , @xmath53 the atmospheric extinction coefficient , @xmath54 the airmass and @xmath55 the colour correction coefficient . in practice",
    ", for each of our stellar fields , we identified the standard stars with the help of the maps published by @xcite , and for each star measured the magnitude which enters in equation  [ eq : phot ] as @xmath51 .",
    "this was done by means of standard iraf tasks , within the _ noao.digiphot.daophot _ and _ noao.digiphot.photcal _ packages .",
    "the sky background was evaluated taking the mode of the intensity in an annular region around each star , situated 3 - 4 times the full - width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the stellar profile away from its peak ; the star was sky - subtracted and the computed magnitude corrected for aperture effects .",
    "all the stars affected by scattered light or saturated , and those for which the fits performed in iraf did not converge , were removed .",
    "we took all the remaining stars with measured instrumental magnitudes and solved equation [ eq : phot ] for @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath55 .",
    "we then grouped the stars according to the night in which they had been observed and solved again equation [ eq : phot ] on a per - night basis , keeping the colour term @xmath55 -which is very close to zero- fixed to the ` global ' value determined at the previous step and fitting for the airmass term @xmath53 and the zero point @xmath52 only .",
    "given that the standard magnitudes of the reference landolt stars are in the @xmath0-band ( johnson ) filter , the photometry of our images is based on that filter . during the flux calibration , we have therefore converted our images from the hst f555w to the @xmath0-band ( johnson ) filter .",
    "the internal accuracy of our flux calibration is around 0.03 magnitudes . in order to investigate systematic departures of our calibration",
    ", we compared our measurements to apparent magnitudes measured with the same aperture on hst / wfpc2 pc1 images .",
    "the set of galaxies used in the comparison is that published by @xcite and for which sky values are reported .",
    "the choice of aperture was arbitrarily set to @xmath4/2 , with the constraint of it being larger than 5@xmath56 to avoid uncertainties derived from the different psfs and smaller than 15@xmath56 to be fully included within the pc1 chip .",
    "the difference between our @xmath0-band magnitudes and those of lauer s hst / f555w imaging is better than 0.05 magnitudes rms , with a small systematic offset .",
    "the mdm flux calibration predicts slightly brighter ( @xmath570.05 mag ) galaxies than hst .",
    "this shift is , however , within the expected @xmath58  f555w zero - point transformation for different late - type stellar templates ( i.e. it conforms to the dominant old population in our galaxies ) .",
    "steps ) in both the @xmath0- and @xmath23 m bands .",
    "the largest isophotes are set to reach the limiting surface brightness of the survey in each band ( @xmath4625 and @xmath4621 mag arcsec@xmath27 respectively ) .",
    "the orientation of the images is such that north is up and east is left .",
    "the hubble morphological type is indicated in the bottom right corner .",
    "the field - of - view of the observations is much larger than displayed here . ]      in an attempt to extend our analysis of the scaling relations to longer wavebands than the optical , and to alleviate the loss of the f814w mdm observations , we decided to use the homogeneous irac @xmath23 m imaging dataset provided by the _ spitzer _ telescope .",
    "this dataset has the great advantage of being less sensitive to the presence of dust and provides a better tracer for the underlying , dominant , predominantly old stellar mass component of galaxies .",
    "we retrieved the infrared array camera ( irac ) images of our sample galaxies at @xmath23 m through the spitzer science center ( ssc ) archive .",
    "these archival images cover a significant fraction of the ` sauron `  sample , and were acquired in the context of several programs .",
    "the remaining objects were observed as part of the specific program 50630 ( pi : g. van der wolk ) during cycle 5 , meant to complete observations of the ` sauron `  sample in both irac and mips ( multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ) bands .",
    "we used the bcd images , and mosaiced them together using the mopex software .",
    "this avoided the artificial point sources sometimes present in the centre of the pbcd images .",
    "details about the reduction are given in the irac instrument handbook .",
    "the output mosaics were then sky subtracted in the standard way . as indicated in the handbook , a zero - point of 280.9 jy was assumed for flux calibration of the data into the vega system .",
    "further details regarding the data reduction can be found in paper xv and in van der wolk et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "after the data reduction and flux calibration processes , we estimate the limiting surface brightness of our @xmath23m - band data to be @xmath4621 mag arcsec@xmath27 . in order to illustrate the quality of our imaging , in figure  [ fig : contours ] we show isophotal contours down to the limiting surface brightness of a few galaxies in our sample .",
    "the consistency in the photometric depth of both datasets ensures that our measured parameters truly reflect the potential structural changes as a function of waveband , and are not affected by poor imaging .",
    "we have made a comprehensive effort to collect the best available distance estimates in the literature for all galaxies in our sample .",
    "we have assigned distance estimates adopting the following priority order in the methods used :    1 .   for 42 galaxies ,",
    "the distances were obtained with the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method by @xcite for the acs virgo cluster survey , @xcite using archival acs imaging , and @xcite using ground - based imaging .",
    "we subtract 0.06 mag from the latter distance moduli ( i.e. , a 2.7% decrease in distance ) to convert to the same zero point as the hst key project cepheid distances @xcite .",
    "2 .   for 1 galaxy ( ngc5308 ) , the distance is derived using supernovae type ia luminosities from @xcite , subtracting 0.43 mag from the distance moduli to convert to @xmath16 .",
    "3 .   for 10 galaxies within 12@xmath59 of the virgo cluster center ( defined by the galaxy m87 ) and with heliocentric velocities @xmath60 , we followed @xcite and assigned the virgo cluster distance modulus of @xmath61mag @xcite and an error of @xmath62mag due to the depth of the cluster .",
    "4 .   for 2 galaxies ( ngc2273 and ngc5448 ) ,",
    "the distances are based on `` look - alike '' galaxies @xcite from @xcite , calibrated with the hst key project cepheid distances .",
    "5 .   for 4 galaxies ,",
    "the distances are based on the correlation between galaxy luminosity and linewidth ( tully - fisher relation ) from @xcite , calibrated with the hst key project cepheid distances .",
    "6 .   for 1 galaxy ( ngc5198 ) , the distance is based on the @xmath63@xmath6 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) relation from @xcite , adopting @xmath16  and an error of @xmath64mag in the distance modulus .",
    "7 .   for the remaining 12 galaxies ,",
    "the distances are based on their observed heliocentric radial velocities given by ned , using the velocity field model of @xcite with the terms for the influence of the virgo cluster and the great attractor .    the methods ( i)(iii ) typically yield errors in the distances of @xmath65% , while methods ( iv)(vi ) are expected to be accurate to better than @xmath66% .",
    "comparing these reliable distance estimates for 60/72 galaxies in our sample with the distance estimates based on the observed redshifts using method ( vii ) , we find a ( biweight ) dispersion of @xmath67% .",
    "taking into account the average 7% error in the accurate distance estimates , we thus adopt for the redshift distances a typical error of @xmath68% , i.e. @xmath69mag in the redshift distance modulus .",
    "tables  [ tab : photpars_eso ] and [ tab : photpars_sa ] list the adopted distances as well as the sources of the distance estimates .",
    "one of the main goals of this project is the measurement of homogeneous photometric quantities . as in paper iv ,",
    "we have opted for simple , yet frequently used , methods to derive these values .",
    "this has the advantage of being well reproducible and of allowing comparison with a wide range of studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the values measured here are based on aperture photometry . for each galaxy , in both the @xmath0-band and the @xmath23m - band , we extracted radial profiles on circular apertures using the _ mge_fit_sectors _ idl package of @xcite .",
    "foreground stars and nearby objects were masked using the _ sextractor _ lists generated for the registration of the images ( see   [ sec : mdmred ] ) .",
    "the profiles were flux calibrated and corrected for galactic extinction using the a@xmath70 and a@xmath71 values from ned , which are based on _ cobe _ , _ iras _ and the leiden - dwingeloo hi emission maps as discussed by @xcite .",
    "we have made no attempt to correct the observed fluxes or luminosities for internal extinction .    throughout the figures of this paper , circles denote e / s0 galaxies and diamonds sa galaxies .",
    "filled symbols indicate galaxies with good distance estimates , whereas open symbols denote those with only recession velocity determinations . in",
    "blue we highlight fast rotator galaxies , in red slow rotator galaxies ( see  [ sec : kinparams ] ) and in green sa galaxies .",
    "the special case of ngc4550 , a galaxy known to consist of two counter - rotating stellar discs of similar mass ( @xcite ; paper x ) , is marked in yellow .      we have determined the effective radii and mean effective surface brightnesses for our sample galaxies by fitting our aperture photometry profiles with @xmath72 @xcite growth curves of the form @xmath73,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath74 the incomplete gamma function , @xmath4  the effective radius , @xmath75 the effective surface brightness ( at @xmath4 ) , @xmath76 the srsic index describing the curvature of the radial profile , and we adopt @xcite @xmath77 which is an approximation to better than @xmath78 for @xmath79 .    when fitting the growth curve profiles , generally the inner @xmath80 as well as regions outside 1@xmath6 above the sky level have been ignored . the former avoids potential complications due to the point spread function and the latter reduces the uncertainties associated with imperfect sky subtraction .",
    "we have used the integrated srsic profile only to extrapolate the outermost part of the growth curve to infinity and estimate the total galaxy luminosity .",
    "after this , we have determined @xmath4  from the radius where the growth curve profiles are equal to half this total luminosity , i.e. , equal to @xmath81@xmath82(@xmath83@xmath4 ) . in other words , we have not adopted the @xmath4  values from the srsic fit , even though they turned out to be very similar to those from the growth curve profiles after obtaining @xmath81  from the srsic fit . while the surface brightness profiles of galaxies are not perfectly described by a @xmath84 law ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the sa galaxies systematically populate a region above the best - fit relation .",
    "given the relative insensitivity of @xmath2  to dust ( at least much less than absolute magnitudes in the optical ) , this diagram is potentially useful to remove dusty objects in samples destined for cmr studies .",
    "it also confirms that the average dust content is larger in spiral galaxies than in earlier - type systems . despite these deviant objects ,",
    "it is worth noting that there are a few sa galaxies in the region populated by sr / fr galaxies .",

    "we have plotted in the bottom - right panel of fig .",

    "this combination of colours and line indices is consistent , in the sense that both predictions are based on the same set of isochrones @xcite and were computed for a kroupa ( @xcite ) initial mass function .",
    "these isochrones take into account the latest stages of stellar evolution through the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) regime to the point of complete envelope ejection .",
    "these models show that the dependence of the ( @xmath97$])@xmath132 colour with age is rather subtle even for young stellar populations , being much more sensitive to metallicity than age .",

    "now that we have assessed that metallicity is the main driver of the ( @xmath97$])@xmath132 colour , we can deduce from the colour-@xmath2  relation that there must be a strong correlation between metallicity and @xmath2 .",

    "there is a hint of this feature in the relations for the coma cluster by @xcite and @xcite , but it is somehow not seen in other relations in the literature based on much larger numbers of galaxies ( e.g. b03 , @xcite ) .",
    "this might be because galaxies with low velocity dispersions are often removed from the samples .",
    "irrespective of selection effects , the slopes derived here are slightly shallower than previously found ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in part this is because it is common to use central velocity dispersions , which will increasingly deviate from the values reported here ( measured in a larger aperture ) for larger galaxies , as the velocity dispersion gradients are steeper in the inner parts of larger galaxies .",
    "in this paper we adopt the following notation for the fp : @xmath143 the multivariate nature of the fp makes common least - squares minimisation algorithms not suitable to determine the main parameters ( @xmath144 ) .",

    "we restrict our fit to e / s0 galaxies with good distance determinations ( i.e. filled sr / fr galaxies in the relations ) . from the comparison of our data with those of b03 , we have established that the lack of objects with @xmath141@xmath147 mag arcsec@xmath27 in our sample effectively means that we miss galaxies with @xmath4@xmath14812 kpc .",

    "the importance of also computing the velocity dispersion within the same half - light radius was already shown in figure  [ fig : litcomp ] : even though the photometric quantities taken from different literature sources for galaxies in our sample individually might vary substantially , when combined with a consistently measured integrated velocity dispersion , they all fall on our best - fit classic fp . in ",

    "although difficult to assess accurately , we believe that the main differences are due to a combination of photometric bands employed , fitting methods , and specially sample selection ( since we include the sa galaxies , unlike previous works ) . there is nevertheless a large disparity in the literature regarding the value of the fp coefficients .",

    "since this colour correlates strongly with metallicity , see appendix  [ app : models ] ) .",
    "it is important to remind the reader that we have only corrected for the effects produced by stellar populations , and partly by rotation ( by using @xmath2 ) .",
    "still there are a number of other factors that influence the final location of galaxies in the fp .",

    "[ fig : fp ] and [ fig : fpml ] is the differences between the values reported .",

    "[ fig : fp ] , while fig .",
    "[ fig : fpml ] includes the sa galaxies as well . if we focus on this last figure we observe , apart from a change in the slopes , an improvement ( i.e. a decrease ) of the scatter for _ all _ families when we include the  and @xmath113  terms to correct for the effects of young populations .",
    "it is also interesting to note that once corrected for this effect , the intrinsic values found for the different families indicate that while fr and sa galaxies are consistent within the uncertainties , they are clearly different from those of the srs . this finding emphasises the results presented in paper ix and subsequent papers in the sauron series suggesting , based on our kinematic classification , that these may be intrinsically a different kind of galaxies . this clear distinction is not found between morphologically classified elliptical and lenticular galaxies .",
    "the comparison of the scatter presented here with others in the literature has to be treated with caution as , while most works concentrate in e / s0 galaxies , the different samples were selected with very different criteria in terms of luminosity or velocity dispersion .",
    "in addition , the methods used to fit the relation can affect this comparison , although the minimisation of the residuals via an orthogonal fit is the most widely adopted .",
    "there is a general agreement that the observed scatter is consistent among photometric bands , a result we share .",
    "the typical observed scatter for a general population of e / s0 galaxies is around 0.10 dex in log(@xmath4 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "they report that this value is consistent with the measurement errors .",

    ", we find a very small amount of intrinsic scatter left , @xmath174 dex and @xmath175 dex in the v - band and 3.6mu - band respectively .",
    "the uncertainties in the our estimates suggest that the scatter around the best - fit fp are fully explained by the observational errors .",
    "another interesting point to discuss is whether the use of a large aperture velocity dispersion , instead of a central value , helps to reduce the intrinsic scatter in the relation .",
    "this was nicely discussed in @xcite and @xcite , using samples of elliptical and lenticular galaxies and dynamical models with some assumptions on the shape of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "the ` sauron `  spectrograph gives us now the chance to repeat this exercise using real data .",
    "we have measured the velocity dispersion within @xmath88/8 ( @xmath176 ) for our sample of galaxies and then fit the fp in the same manner done in fig .",
    "[ fig : fpml ] .",
    "this is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fpml_re8 ] .",
    "the different panels show that the use of a small aperture velocity dispersion affects the resulting fits in two important ways : ( 1 ) increasing the intrinsic scatter of the relations for all families of objects , ( 2 ) the measured parameter @xmath110 has lower values than those obtained when @xmath2  is used .",
    "the first point is mainly due to the fact that with the smaller aperture we are probing regions of the galaxies where intense star formation is taking place or inner discs exist , and thus the measured velocity dispersion is more representative of areas around the nuclei than the galaxy as a whole .",
    "the second effect is likely produced by the fact that @xmath177 systematically departs from @xmath2  ( i.e. it is larger ) for increasing @xmath2  values .",
    "this , together with the expected relation between @xmath4  and @xmath2  ( given the slr and fjr ) , helps to reduce the measured slope of the fp relation .",
    "overall , we estimate an increase of around 15% in the intrinsic scatter and an average 10% decrease in @xmath110 as a result of using a central value for the velocity dispersion term .",
    "it is also worth noting that the scatter of the sa galaxies has not increased as much as for the sr and fr families .",
    "this supports the idea that star formation in early - type systems takes place predominantly in their central regions , while for sa galaxies this can happen over a much larger region ( see also paper xi ) , and therefore it does not necessarily make much difference to measure the velocity dispersion in a small or large aperture .",
    "alternatively , this result could be due to the shallower nature of the stellar velocity dispersion profiles of the sa galaxies compared to those of the sr / fr galaxies .",
    "in this paper we report results from photometric follow - up conducted in the context of the ` sauron `  project . we use ground - based mdm @xmath0-band and _",
    "spitzer_/irac 3.6@xmath1m - band imaging to characterise our sample of e , s0 and sa galaxies .",
    "we perform aperture photometry to derive homogeneous half - light radii , mean effective surface brightnesses and total magnitudes .",
    "combined with the ` sauron `  integral - field spectroscopic observations , this allows us to explore and understand the location of the galaxies in the main scaling relations as a function of the level of rotation , kinematic substructure , stellar populations and environment .",
    "a number of conclusions can be derived from the work presented and are summarised in the following points :    * the level of kinematic substructure ( as determined from our stellar kinematic maps ) or the environment do not lead to a preferred location in any of the scaling relations investigated .",
    "however , this is subject to the potential biases introduced by our sample selection .",
    "our _ cluster _ environment is defined by the virgo cluster and leo group . * the slow rotator ( sr )",
    "galaxies define tighter relations than fast rotator ( fr ) galaxies .",
    "while this is not totally unexpected ( i.e. sr are uniformly old systems ) , it is remarkable how the trend is kept both for small and large @xmath4 .",
    "we find that the sr and fr galaxies do not populate distinct locations in the scaling relations .",
    "the sa family is the main contributor to the scatters . *",

    "this effect results in a very tight @xmath3)-$]@xmath2  relation that allows us to define a strong correlation between metallicity and @xmath2 . *",
    "a large number of sa galaxies appear to follow the main relations defined by earlier - type systems , and are not necessarily offset as previously found .",
    "we believe this is due to the use of @xmath179 ( the stellar velocity dispersion integrated within @xmath4 ) , which is not as much influenced by the presence of young inner discs and accounts to a large extent for rotation in the galaxies .",
    "* fr and sa galaxies that appear offset from the relations correspond mostly to objects with extremely young populations and signs of on - going , extended star formation ( as already highlighted in papers xiii and xv ) .",
    "for the specific case of the fundamental plane , we made an attempt to correct for this effect so that all galaxies are part of a tight , single relation .",
    "once this is done , the fp coefficients in the @xmath0- and 3.6@xmath1m - bands are the same within the uncertainties .",
    "the new estimated coefficients suggest that differences in stellar populations account for about 50% of the observed tilt with respect to the virial prediction .",
    "* the observed scatter of the sr family around the fundamental plane is smaller than that of the fr or sa galaxies . after correcting for stellar populations ,",
    "the sr family shows almost no intrinsic scatter around the best - fit fundamental plane . * the use of a velocity dispersion within a small aperture ( e.g. @xmath4/8 ) in the fundamental plane results in an increase of around 15% in the intrinsic scatter and an average 10% decrease of the tilt away from the virial relation ( as a result of the correlation between @xmath4  and @xmath2 , given by the size - luminosity and faber - jackson relations).-1    we have deliberately focused on the role of stellar populations on the main scaling relations of early - type galaxies .",
