    "since the pioneering works of fuller , fowler , & newman ( 1980 , 1982a , 1982b , 1985 ) , calculations of stellar weak - interaction rates have entered an era of precision science .",
    "more recently an authoritative work of langanke & martinez - pinedo ( 2000 ) on this subject appeared .",
    "since the presupernova stellar evolution and stellar nucleosynthesis critically depend on the details of the stellar weak - interaction rates ( e.g. , wanajo et al .",
    "2002 ) , it is extremely important to calculate accurately the screening corrections to the electron capture rates in dense stars by the relativistically degenerate electron liquid .",
    "this problem has been already addressed by many authors ( couch & loumos 1974 ; takahashi , el eid , & hillebrandt 1978 ; gutierrez et al .",
    "1996 ; luo & peng 1996 ; bravo & garcia - senz 1999 ) .",
    "the plasma effects on the chemical potential of the nucleus and hence on the threshold energy for the electron capture , in particular , have been discussed by couch & loumos ( 1974 ) , gutierrez et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , as well as by bravo & garcia - senz ( 1999 ) .",
    "in this paper we will address ourselves to the calculation of the effective potential energy felt by the relativistically degenerate electron .",
    "we will use the linear response theory in order to calculate the screening potential caused by the relativistically degenerate electron liquid .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we will calculate the effective potential energy felt by the electron using the longitudinal dielectric function of the relativistically degenerate electron liquid derived by jancovici ( 1962 ) .",
    "we will thereby calculate the screening potential which will be used for the calculation of the screening corrections to the electron capture rates . in ",
    "3 we will summarize the numerical results in the form of analytic fitting formulae which will facilitate the application of the present results .",
    "we will give concluding remarks in ",
    "the coulomb corrections to the beta decay rates have been discussed in many standard textbooks on beta decay ( e.g. , morita 1973 ) .",
    "some authors ( takahashi , el eid , & hillebrandt 1978 ; fuller , fowler , & newman 1980 ) have discussed possible importance of the screening effects on the electron capture rates at extremely high densities .",
    "therefore , it is extremely important to calculate accurately the screening corrections to the electron capture rates by the relativistically degenerate electron liquid .",
    "we consider the density - temperature regime in which the electrons are strongly degenerate .",
    "this condition is expressed as ( itoh et al .",
    "1983 ) @xmath0 \\ ,   [ { \\rm k } ] \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the electron fermi temperature , @xmath2 is the mass density in units of @xmath3 g @xmath4 , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the atomic number and mass number of the nucleus considered , respectively . we assume complete pressure ionization .",
    "therefore , no bound electrons will exist around the nucleus .",
    "this assumption is valid when the following condition is satisfied ( itoh et al .",

    "the potential energy of the electron due to the pure coulomb potential @xmath9 is changed to @xmath10 because of the screening by the relativistically degenerate electron liquid . in this paper",
    "we use the static longitudinal dielectric function due to the relativistically degenerate electron liquid calculated by jancovici ( 1962 ) based on the relativistic random - phase approximation .",
    "jancovici s static longitudinal dielectric function is written in the form ( itoh et al .",

    "dharma - wardama & perrot ( 1982 , 1990 ) have carried out the density - functional study of hydrogen plasmas as well as the density - functional study of c , si , and ge metallic liquids and have found that the detailed results of the density - functional calculations of these systems are close to the results obtained by the linear response theory .",
    "they have also confirmed that the density - functional theory as well as the linear response theory reproduce satisfactorily the experimental results on the ge metallic liquid , thereby proving the excellence of these theories for this system .",
    "this fact gives great support to our use of the linear response theory in the present problem .",
    "compared with the case of the pure coulomb potential , the effective electron energy at the position of the nucleus is increased by @xmath20 . hence the usual factor in the electron - capture rates @xmath21 ( morita 1973 ; fuller , fowler , & newman 1980 ; langanke & martinez - pinedo 2000 ) should be replaced by @xmath22^{2 } - m_{e}^{2 } \\right\\}^{1/2 }     \\left [ e - v_{s}(0 ) \\right ] \\ , f \\left[z , e - v_{s}(0 ) \\right ] \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at the same time the shift in the threshold energy for the electron capture should be taken into account ( couch & loumos 1974 ; gutierrez et al . 1996 ; bravo & garcia - senz 1999 ) .    in figure  1",

    "this fact justifies our use of @xmath20 for the screening potential at the nuclear radius .",
    "when the mass density becomes extremely high , then one should use the value of the screening potential @xmath35 by adopting the value of the function @xmath36 .",

    "it is interesting to compare our present detailed calculation with the fermi - thomas model which is generally more crude than the random - phase approximation that has been adopted in the present paper ( pines and nozires 1966 ) . in the fermi - thomas model the screening potential at the origin",

    "when the electrons are extremely relativistic , the fermi - thomas screening wave number is expressed as ( flowers & itoh 1976 ) @xmath41 by comparing with figures  2 , 3 , 4 , we find that the prediction of the fermi - thomas model is quite good ( the accuracy is about 7% ) for the present problem when the electrons are extremely relativistic .",
    "in this section we will present accurate analytic fitting formulae for @xmath32 in order to facilitate the application of the numerical results obtained in the present paper .",

    "the value of @xmath46 for @xmath47 is of course obtained by the fitting formulae ( 3.1 ) , ( 3.2 ) , ( 3.3 ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we will give a separate fitting formula @xmath48 the coefficients @xmath49 are presented in table  2 .",
    "the accuracy of the fitting is generally better than 0.1% .",
    "we have studied the screening corrections to the electron capture rates by the relativistically degenerate electron liquid . in particular , we have calculated the screening potential caused by the relativistically degenerate electron by using jancovici s ( 1962 ) static longitudinal dielectric function .",

    "hence we conclude that the screening corrections to the electron capture rates at high densities are not as great as anticipated by takahashi , el eid , & hillebrandt ( 1978 ) and also by fuller , fowler , & newman ( 1980 ) .",
