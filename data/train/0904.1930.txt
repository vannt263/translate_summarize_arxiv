    "the appearance of shape coexistence in nuclei has attracted a lot of attention in recent decades @xcite and compelling evidence has been obtained , in particular , at and very near to proton or neutron closed shells . the pb region takes a prominent position because in addition to specific shell - model excitations established close to the @xmath3 neutron shell closure , collective excitations have been observed for the neutron - deficient nuclei @xcite .",
    "the review paper of julin _",
    "@xcite gives an extensive overview of the rich variety in nuclear excitation modes for both the pb , hg , pt and , po , rn nuclei .",
    "since the publication of that paper , however , many experiments have been performed highlighting properties of excited band structures and lifetimes for the pb nuclei @xcite and nearby nuclei , also illuminating the underlying mechanisms that are at the origin of the formation of collective excitations in the neutron - deficient nuclei near to the @xmath4 proton closed shell .",
    "this mass region has been studied theoretically in an extensive way .",
    "early calculations using a deformed woods - saxon potential in order to explore the nuclear energy surfaces as a function of the quadrupole deformation variables @xcite showed a consistent picture pointing out the presence of oblate and prolate energy minima .",
    "more recently , mean - field calculations going beyond the static part , including dynamical effects using the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) @xcite , either starting from skyrme functionals @xcite , or using the gogny d1s parametrization @xcite have put the former calculations on firm ground and have also given rise to detailed information of the collective bands observed in neutron - deficient nuclei around the @xmath4 closed proton shell . here , we should also mention attempts to study shape transitions in the os and pt nuclei within the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach @xcite .",
    "> from a microscopic shell - model approach , the hope to treat on equal footing the large open neutron shell from @xmath3 down to and beyond the mid - shell @xmath5 region , with valence protons in the pt , hg , po , and rn nuclei , and even including proton multi - particle multi - hole ( mp - nh ) excitations across the @xmath4 shell closure , is far beyond present computational possibilities .",
    "the truncation of the model space , however , by concentrating on nucleon pair modes ( mainly @xmath6 and @xmath7 coupled pairs , to be treated as bosons within the interacting boson approximation ( ibm ) @xcite ) , has made the calculations feasible , even including pair excitations across the @xmath4 shell closure @xcite in the pb region .",
    "more in particular , the pb nuclei have been extensively studied giving rise to bands with varying collectivity depending on the nature of the excitations treated in the model space @xcite .    in view of the fact that near the mid - shell point of the valence neutron major shell @xmath8 ( @xmath5 ) clear - cut examples ( see the discussion before ) of coexisting collective bands have been observed in both the pb ( @xmath4 ) and hg ( @xmath9 ) isotopes ,",
    "it is of the utmost importance to study the propagation of these coexisting structures as one gradually moves away from the @xmath4 proton closed shell",
    ". therefore , detailed studies for both the pt , os , ... isotopes ( @xmath10 , ... ) and the po , rn , ... isotopes ( @xmath11 , ... ) are of major importance in order to explore the evolution from coexisting spherical and deformed structures at the closed shell towards the onset of normal , open - shell deformation . in order to gain insight into this transition , one should , in particular , study those observables that are sensitive to specific mp - nh excitations such as the appearance of distinct collective bands making use , in particular , of coulomb excitation with radioactive beams , @xmath12-decay hindrance factors , isotopic shifts , e0 decay properties , g - factors .",
    "moreover , data on low - lying excited states in the adjacent odd - proton mass au , tl , bi , ...  isotopes as well as in the odd - neutron mass pt , hg , pb , po , rn isotopes should allow to explore the importance of particular single - particle excitations in this mass region .",
    "the pt nuclei form a most important set of isotopes in order to study the above question .    in the present paper ,",
    "we reanalyze the pt nuclei , motivated by the above questions and recent ibm calculations @xcite without explicitly including intruder excitations into the model space , considering the 4 proton holes and the number of valence neutrons with the boson model approximation . before",
    ", it has been suggested by wood @xcite that proton 6h-2p configurations must be considered , besides the regular proton 4h configurations , in order to describe the experimental data in the pt and adjacent nuclei , in particular the sudden lowering of the first excited @xmath13 down to mass number @xmath14 associated with a specific change in the excitation energy for the first excited @xmath15 state in the same mass interval .",
    "thus , it becomes clear that the pt nuclei form a most important series of isotopes in order to study the above question .",
    "more specifically , within the ibm configuration - mixing approach @xcite ( ibm - cm for short ) , calculations have been carried out for the pt nuclei by harder _",
    "_ @xcite and by king _",
    "_ @xcite describing the low - lying excited states in the @xmath16pt nuclei . in the latter studies",
    ", also @xmath17 factors and isotopic shifts were calculated and shown to be in good agreement with the known data @xcite .",
    "however , no @xmath0 values , which constitute an important test , were calculated .",
    "we should mention that the even - even pt around mass number @xmath18 have been studied before in the framework of the proton - neutron interacting boson model by bijker _",
    "et al . _",
    "they calculated a large number of observables such as the energy spectra , various ratios of reduced @xmath19 transition probabilities , absolute @xmath0 values and quadrupole moments , two - nucleon transfer reaction intensities , isotopic and isomeric shifts and e0 transition rates . in view of the fact that this study dates back to 1980 , an extensive set of new data",
    "have become available since .",
    "this warrants an in - depth study of the pt nuclei , spanning the region from the heavier pt nuclei ( around @xmath20 ) into the lightest pt nuclei near a @xmath21 172 .    in the present study ,",
    "we show that for the excited states below an excitation energy of @xmath22 mev , the ibm calculations with or without including explicitly particle - hole excitations reproduce equally well the excitation energies and absolute @xmath0 values of known states in the mass region @xmath23 .",
    "how then can we interpret a possible equivalence of the energies , and the @xmath0 values for a limited number of states , below @xmath2 mev between both calculations ?",
    "this excitation energy approximately marks the start of a region in which a unique comparison between a specific experimental level and a particular level in the ibm calculations becomes difficult to be made .",
    "first of all , we point out that even though the hilbert spaces of both models are largely different , due to the limited number of states below @xmath2 mev , it is not possible to discriminate between the models considering only excitation energies and @xmath0 values .",
    "secondly , we point out that the difference in the hamiltonians can result from a renormalization of the interaction .",
    "we also show that , moving towards higher - lying levels , clear differences appear between the model spaces .",
    "moreover , we explore theoretical possibilities to understand the fact that excitation energies and electromagnetic quadrupole properties ( @xmath0 values and quadrupole moments ) exhibit a very strong ressemblance , although originating from highly different wave functions . in a forthcoming paper , we shall present the results of a comparison covering an as complete as possible data set ( encompassing also @xmath12-decay hindrance factors , @xmath17 factors , isotopic shifts , e0 decay properties , and also properties of the energy spectra of adjacent odd - mass pt and au nuclei ) with the two theoretical approaches , _",
    "i.e. , _ considering a reduced model space versus an enlarged model space including particle - hole excitations , within the interacting boson model context .",
    "the even - even pt nuclei , in particular the region of neutron - deficient isotopes situated around and even beyond @xmath5 neutron number ( @xmath24 ) , spanning the mass interval @xmath23 , have been extensively studied over the last decades .",

    "the experimental energy systematics for the pt nuclei , including the region of interest which is mainly situated around the neutron @xmath5 mid - shell number , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - system - wood ] and spans the interval @xmath66 .",
    "the systematics is limited to levels with an excitation energy up to @xmath22 mev ( a limited number of higher - spin states are given beyond this cut - off ) and will serve as a `` basis '' to compare with the calculations described in section [ sec - comparing ] .",
    "this figure is based on the information available in the appropriate nuclear data sheets , enlarged or improved including the more recent papers discussing these particular even - even pt nuclei .",
    "figure [ fig - system - wood ] is characterized by a sudden drop of the first excited @xmath13 state , down to mass @xmath14 , remaining essentially constant for lower mass numbers ( down to mass @xmath28 ) .",
    "the energy spectrum remains remarkably constant in the mass interval @xmath67 , contrasting with a different structure that shows a number of up sloping levels with increasing mass number @xmath68 beyond mass @xmath14 .",
    "in the present study we compare calculations carried out within the context of the ibm , incorporating 2p-2h excitations across the @xmath4 proton closed shell into the model space ( also called ibm - configuration mixing , or ibm - cm as a shorthand notation ) , with recent studies using the standard ibm in which excitations across the @xmath4 core are not included explicitly .    the ibm - cm allows the simultaneous treatment and mixing of several boson configurations which correspond to different particle  hole ( p  h ) shell excitations @xcite . on the basis of intruder spin symmetry @xcite",
    ", no distinction is made between particle and hole bosons .",
    "hence , the model space which includes the regular proton 4h configurations and a number of valence neutrons outside of the @xmath69 closed shell ( corresponding to the standard ibm treatment for the pt even - even nuclei ) as well as the proton 6h-2p configurations and the same number of valence neutrons corresponds to a @xmath70\\oplus[n+2]$ ] boson space ( @xmath71 , being the number of active protons , counting both , proton holes and particles , plus the number of valence neutrons outside the @xmath3 or the @xmath69 closed shell ( depending on the nearest closed shell ) , divided by @xmath72 as the boson number ) .",

    "we are not considering the most general ibm hamiltonian in each hilbert space , [ n ] and [ n+2 ] , but we are restricting ourselves to an ecqf formalism @xcite in each subspace .",
    "this approach has been shown to be a rather good approximation in many calculations .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 can be associated with the energy needed to excite two particles across the @xmath4 shell gap , corrected for the pairing interaction gain and including monopole effects @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath77 describes the mixing between the @xmath71 and the @xmath85 configurations and is defined as @xmath86      the @xmath19 transition operator for two - configuration mixing is subsequently defined as @xmath88 where the @xmath89 ( @xmath79 ) are the effective boson charges and @xmath90 is the quadrupole operator defined in eq .",
