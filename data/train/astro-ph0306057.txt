    "for many years it has been well known that pulsars  compact remains of supernova explosions  are rapidly rotating , highly magnetized neutron stars ( nss ) .",
    "however , sources discovered in recent years have shown that nss also appear to come in other varieties : even more highly magnetized objects with slow spins , such as anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and more poorly understood objects near the centers of snrs with detectable x - ray flux , but no optical / radio counterparts or signs of rotation , so - called compact central objects ( ccos ; * ? ? ?",
    "their spectra are very soft , with blackbody temperatures @xmath0  kev , often requiring additional power law component with photon indices of @xmath1 @xcite . in this article",

    "early _ rosat _ observations identified two point sources within the boundaries of the snr shell ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; see also figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the source further away from the center of the remnant , 1wga  j1714.4@xmath23945 , was determined to be of stellar origin @xcite .",
    "for the other source , 1wga  j1713.4@xmath23949 , located at the geometrical center of the snr , no optical counterpart has been found within 10  of the _ rosat _ position @xcite , and the source has correspondingly been suggested to be a candidate for an associated neutron star . while _ asca _",
    "observations were not able to provide useful limits to the pulsations in the x - ray band @xcite , radio pulsations were detected with a 392  ms period within a 7  radius region towards this source ( psr j17133945 * ? ? ?",
    ".  has been observed with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ as a part of a project to study nonthermal radio and x - ray emission from the snr shell @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a detailed spectral and timing analysis of ps .  using our _ chandra _ data , as well as archival data from the _ xmm - newton and rxte _ satellites .",
    "we also present properties of the radio pulsar psr j17133945 , which imply it is not related to ps .  or snr g347.30.5 .",
    "two fields towards g347.3@xmath20.5 were observed on 2000 july 25 with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) detector on board the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( obsid 736 and 737 ) .",
    "the acis - i detector for obsid 736 was positioned at the bright northwestern rim of the snr and the roll angle was such that ps",
    ".   fell on the s1 chip ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "data were taken in timed exposure mode with an integration time of 3.2  s per frame . the fully processed level 2 data",
    "were reduced using standard threads in the ciao software package version 2.2.1 .",
    "the effective exposure time after data processing was 29.6  ks .",
    "the exposure - corrected _ chandra _ image of the snr and the compact source ps .  is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , with the _ rosat _ contours overlaid .",
    "the image was binned in @xmath3 pixels and smoothed with a gaussian filter with a fwhm of 2 .",
    "the image of the compact source is elongated because its location is well off - axis ( @xmath4 23 ) from the aim point .",
    "we obtained archival _",
    "_ data of ps .  carried out on 2001 march 2 with a 15  ks exposure ( obsid 0093670501 ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the european photon imaging camera ( epic)-pn camera was operated in extended full frame mode with time resolution of 199  ms , while the two epic - mos cameras were operated in full frame mode with a time resolution of 2.6  s. the epic data reduction was performed using the sas software package version 5.4.1 .",
    "the event files used for analysis were created from observational data files ( odfs ) using the sas tasks epchain and emchain .",
    "the net exposure time after filtering event files for good time intervals was 9.2  ks in the pn camera and 14.1  ks in each mos camera .",
    "we used archival data of snr g347.30.5 @xcite from the proportional counter array ( pca ) aboard the _ rxte _ satellite , which is sensitive to x - ray photons in the energy band 260 kev and has a field of view with radius @xmath5 .",
    "while the pca has no imaging capability , it has a large effective area ( 6000  @xmath6 ) which makes it suitable for searching for faint x - ray pulsations .",
    "observations of g347.30.5 were made in 7 separate intervals between 1999 june 1424 , with a total exposure time of 100  ks .",
    "analysis of the _ rxte _ data was carried out using lheasoft software version 5.2 .",
    "a 392-ms radio pulsar , psr j1713@xmath23945 , was discovered in a 20 cm targeted search for pulsations in snr g347.30.5 using the parkes telescope and multibeam receiver .",
    "the details of the search and discovery are outlined in @xcite .",
    "the pulsar was subsequently timed with the multibeam receiver at parkes to obtain astrometric and spin parameters and to determine whether the pulsar was associated with ps . .",
    "for the spectral analysis of the _ chandra _ data , we extracted the source counts from a @xmath7 elliptical region around the compact source , and for the background region we used a @xmath8 elliptical region north of the source .",
    "we obtained @xmath9 background - subtracted counts for the source and the spectrum was grouped to contain at least 25 counts per bin .",
    "residuals from fitting standard continuum models to the source spectrum ( blackbody , bremsstrahlung and power law ) revealed an apparent change in the gain calibration on chip s1 that results in a spurious absorption feature around 2  kev .",
    "we extracted data from the on - board calibration source taken before and after our observation , and these show that there is indeed a gain shift for this ccd of @xmath10% .",
    "however , we found that the fit parameters did not change significantly when the gain was frozen at this 3.5% value or when it was left as a free parameter .",
    "we thus allowed gain to vary in our models ( see table  [ tab - fit ] ) .    for spectral analysis of the _ xmm _ data , we obtained @xmath11 background - subtracted counts from the pn camera , and 5@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) in the mos1 ( mos2 ) camera . in the pn camera , the counts were extracted from a 27  radius circular region around the source , and for the background extraction we used a @xmath14 box north from the source position inside the same ccd chip .",
    "similarly , in the mos1 ( mos2 ) camera we used 22(19 ) radius circular region for the source and @xmath15 ( 22 ) radius circular region on the same chip for the background .",
    "the spectra were also grouped to contain at least 25 counts per bin .",
    "we performed a joint spectral analysis of the three epic data sets , allowing only the relative normalization to vary .",
    "the results obtained were consistent with those obtained from the _ chandra _ spectrum .",
    "we therefore proceeded with a joint spectral analysis of _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ spectra .",
    "the results from fitting a few typical neutron star models are summarized in table  [ tab - fit ] and a fit example is given in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "fits with the bremsstrahlung and blackbody models gave equally acceptable results , while the power law model gave a somewhat higher reduced @xmath16 .",
    "the steep photon index of @xmath17 excludes the possibility that ps .",
    "is a background active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , which typically have photon indices of 1.22.2 @xcite .",
    "the best - fit column density ( @xmath18 ) in the power law model of @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 is also somewhat higher than the value of @xmath22@xmath21 found towards the snr @xcite . on the other hand , a blackbody model yields @xmath23@xmath20@xmath21 , which is a lower value than found towards the snr .",
    "the blackbody fit is improved by adding a power law component , which also results in an @xmath18 value consistent with that found towards the snr . in this composite spectrum",
    "the unabsorbed source luminosity is @xmath24 erg s@xmath25 , adopting a distance of @xmath26  kpc to the snr @xcite .",
    "the blackbody normalization yields a relatively small emitting area with radius @xmath27  km , which is significantly smaller than the canonical value for the ns radius of 10  km .",
    "this could imply that most of the thermal emission originates from the polar caps on the ns surface , while the thermal component from the rest of the ns surface is too faint to be detected .",
    "the small inferred radius may be due , at least partly , to oversimplification of the thermal emission from the ns by the blackbody model .",
    "more appropriate models that take into account the ns atmosphere ( nsa ) yield lower ns temperatures , which in turn correspond to larger ns radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to investigate this",
    ", we fit our spectra with two nsa models . the nsa model by @xcite",
    "is calculated for weakly magnetic ns ( @xmath28  g ) and considers hydrogen , solar or iron compositions of the atmosphere .",
    "the nsa model by @xcite assumes the standard magnetic field strength ( @xmath29  g ) and hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "both models assume a standard ns mass of 1.4@xmath30 . both hydrogen models gave acceptable residuals and yielded emitting region sizes close to 10  km , with corresponding reductions in the ns temperature . for either model , however , the derived temperature is above the expected surface temperature for a cooling neutron star more than several hundred years old .",
    "model atmospheres with solar abundance or iron composition gave unacceptable fits predicting broad absorption features not present in the spectra .",
    "we used a fast - fourier transform ( fft ) to search the x - ray data for pulsations from ps . , but found no pulsed signal ; we list upper limits on the pulsed fraction and the search parameters in table  [ tab - timing ] .",
    "the upper limit from _ rxte _ data is least constraining because ps .  only accounts for 0.6% of the total flux in the _ rxte _ s large field of view .    to derive the timing properties of the radio pulsar psr j1713 - 3945",
    "the tempo timing package was used on a total of 27 times - of - arrival ( toas ) with the jpl de200 planetary ephemeris @xcite .",
    "the tempo package converts each toa to the solar system barycenter then refines the timing parameters by minimizing residuals between observed and model toas over the observation span .",
    "the resulting timing parameters are presented in table  [ tab - pulsar ] .",
    "the pulsar s dispersion measure ( dm ) of 337  pc  @xmath31 yields an estimated distance of 4.3  kpc using the revised dm - distance model of @xcite .",
    "the position of the ps .  determined from the _ xmm _",
    "data is r.a  ( j2000 ) @xmath32 , decl .",
    "( j2000 ) @xmath33 ( with an uncertainty of @xmath34 ) .",
    "using our 20 cm radio data of snr g347.30.5 obtained with australia telescope compact array @xcite , we found no radio counterpart for ps . , and derive a 5@xmath35 upper limit for a point source flux of 3  mjy .",
    "this is similar to the limit derived towards the cco in puppis a @xcite .",
    "there is no apparent optical emission at the location of ps .  in the digitized sky survey image , which has an upper limit of @xmath36  mag .",
    "while the distance to the radio pulsar psr j17133945 is broadly consistent with the snr distance of @xmath37 kpc estimated by @xcite , the pulsar is likely to be quite old ( @xmath38  myr , compared to @xmath39  kyr for snr g347.30.5 ) and does not have sufficient spin - down luminosity ( @xmath40  erg  s@xmath25 ) to power the observed x - ray flux from ps .",
    "( @xmath41  erg  s@xmath25 ) .",
    "the newly determined radio timing position of the pulsar is @xmath42 in declination away from the position of ps .",
    "( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "psr j1713@xmath23945 is therefore spatially coincident with snr g347.30.5 by chance , and there is likely no physical association between the two systems .",
    "we detected no x - ray source at the position of psr j17133945 in _ chandra _ or _ xmm _ data . adopting @xmath43@xmath31 ( by scaling the value for the snr to the 4.3  kpc distance of this pulsar )",
    ", we derive an upper limit on the luminosity in the 0.510.0  kev band of @xmath44  erg  s@xmath25 for nonthermal emission with a photon index @xmath45 , and an upper limit on the temperature of 82  ev for blackbody emission from a 10-km radius ns .    the lack of radio and optical counterparts for ps .",
    ", the absence of x - ray pulsations with the current sensitivity and time resolution , the two - component spectrum and its associated luminosity are properties consistent with ccos @xcite .",
    "if this cco is an accretion powered ns , we can consider two scenarios : accretion from a fallback disk or a low - mass companion . the fallback disk has been suggested to form from residual material after the snr explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and has been used to explain and unify the properties of various types of nss @xcite .",
    "however , limits derived from optical and infrared observations seem to disfavor this model , at least for some types of nss ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "interpretations of the emission from ccos as thermal radiation from the surface of a ns run into problems due to high surface temperatures and small emitting areas derived from the blackbody model fits .",
    "the temperature we derived from the blackbody model of 0.4  kev is much higher that the temperature predicted by the standard cooling model @xcite , while the temperature derived from the nsa models ( 0.2  kev ) would imply an ns age of 1001000 yr , which is less than the estimated 2040 kyr age of the snr @xcite .    in the case that ccos are rotation powered nss , the non - detection of radio pulsations can be explained by unfavorable beaming orientation .",
