    "turbulent convection in a fluid heated from below , known as rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) , has been under intense study for some time [ for reviews , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite ] .",
    "a central prediction of models for this system [ @xcite ] is the heat transported by the fluid .",
    "it is usually described in terms of the nusselt number @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the heat current , @xmath3 the cell height , @xmath27 the cross - sectional area , @xmath28 the thermal conductivity , and @xmath29 the applied temperature difference .",
    "the nusselt number depends on the rayleigh number @xmath30 and on the prandtl number @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the isobaric thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath33 the acceleration of gravity , @xmath34 the thermal diffusivity , and @xmath35 the kinematic viscosity .",
    "an important feature of turbulent rbc is the existence of a large - scale circulation ( lsc ) of the fluid [ @xcite ] . for cylindrical samples of aspect ratio @xmath36",
    "the lsc is known to consist of a single cell , with fluid rising along the wall at some azimuthal location @xmath37 and descending along the wall at a location @xmath38 [ see , for instance , @xcite ] . as @xmath39 decreases ,",
    "the nature of the lsc is believed to change .",
    "for @xmath40 it is expected [ @xcite ] that the lsc consists of two or more convection cells , situated vertically one above the other .",
    "regardless of the lsc structure , the heat transport in turbulent rbc is mediated by the emission of hot ( cold ) volumes of fluid known as  plumes \" from a more or less quiescent boundary layer above ( below ) the bottom ( top ) plate .",
    "these plumes are swept away laterally by the lsc and rise ( fall ) primarily near the side wall .",
    "their buoyancy helps to sustain the lsc .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    "reported measurements using a cylindrical sample of water with @xmath41 and with @xmath42 m and @xmath10 m for @xmath43 .",
    "their sample thus had an aspect ratio @xmath9 at the borderline between a single - cell and a multi - cell lsc .",
    "they found exceptionally long relaxation times of @xmath15 that they attributed to a switching of the lsc structure between two states .",
    "multi - stability was observed also in nusselt - number measurements by @xcite for a @xmath44 sample ( see also @xcite for a discussion of these data ) .",
    "chill et al . also found that @xmath15 was reduced by tilting the sample through an angle @xmath0 relative to gravity by an amount given approximately by @xmath45 when @xmath0 is measured in radian .",
    "a reduction by two to five percent of @xmath15 ( depending on @xmath1 ) due to a tilt by @xmath46 of a @xmath44 sample was reported as well recently by @xcite , although in that paper the @xmath0-dependence of this effect was not reported .",
    "chill et al .",
    "developed a simple model that yielded a depression of @xmath15 for the two - cell structure that was consistent in size with their measurements .",
    "their model also assumes that no depression of @xmath15 should be found for a sample of aspect ratio near unity where the lsc is believed to consist of a single convection cell ; they found some evidence to support this in the work of @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent measurements by @xcite for @xmath47 gave the same @xmath15 within 0.1 percent for a level sample and a sample tilted by 0.035 rad .",
    "in this paper we report on a long - term study of rbc in a cylindrical sample with @xmath48 .",
    "as expected , we found no long relaxation times because the lsc is uniquely defined .",
    "the establishment of a statistically stationary state after a large change of @xmath1 occurred remarkably quickly , within a couple of hours , and thereafter there were no further long - term drifts over periods of many days .",
    "we also studied the orientation @xmath49 of the circulation plane of the lsc by measuring the side - wall temperature at eight azimuthal locations [ @xcite ] . with",
    "the sample carefully leveled ( _ i.e. _ @xmath24 ) we found @xmath49 to change erratically , with large fluctuations . there were occasional relatively rapid reorientations , as observed before by @xcite .",
    "the reorientations usually consisted of relatively rapid rotations , and rarely were reversals involving the cessation of the lsc followed by its re - establishment with a new orientation .",
    "this lsc dynamics yielded a broad probability distribution - function @xmath50 , although a preferred orientation prevailed .",
    "when the sample was tilted relative to gravity through an angle @xmath0 , a well defined new orientation of the lsc circulation plane was established , @xmath50 became much more narrow , and virtually all meandering and reorientation of the lsc was suppressed .",
    "we found that @xmath15 was reduced very slightly by tilting the sample .",
    "we obtained @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "this effect is about a factor of 50 smaller than the one observed by chill et al . for their @xmath44 sample .    from side - wall - temperature measurements at two opposite locations we determined time cross - correlation functions @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath51 had a peak that could be fitted well by a gaussian function , centered about a characteristic time @xmath52 that we interpreted as corresponding to the transit time needed by long - lived thermal disturbances to travel with the lsc from one side of the sample to the other , i.e. to half a turnover time of the lsc .",
    "we found that the @xmath0-dependence of the corresponding reynolds number @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "a similar result was obtained from the auto - correlation functions of individual thermometers .",
    "thus there is an @xmath53 effect of @xmath0 on @xmath21 , and yet the effect of @xmath0 on @xmath15 was seen to be nearly two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "we also determined the temperature amplitude @xmath19 of the azimuthal temperature variation at the mid - plane .",
    "we expect @xmath19 to be a monotonically increasing function of the speed of the lsc passing the mid - plane , i.e. of the reynolds number .",
    "we found @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "thus , for small @xmath0 its @xmath0-dependence is very similar to that of the reynolds number .    from the large effect of @xmath0 on @xmath21 and the very small effect on @xmath15",
    "we come to the important conclusion that the heat transport in this system is not influenced significantly by the strength of the lsc .",
    "this heat transport thus must be determined primarily by the efficiency of instability mechanisms in the boundary layers .",
    "it seems reasonable that these mechanisms should be nearly independent of @xmath0 when @xmath0 is small .",
    "this result is consistent with prior measurements by @xcite , who studied the lsc and the nusselt number in a sample with a rectangular cross section .",
    "they inserted vertical grids above ( below ) the bottom ( top ) plate that suppressed the lsc , and found that within their resolution of a percent or so the heat transport was unaltered .",
    "their shadowgraph visualizations beautifully illustrate that the plumes are swept along laterally by the lsc when there are no grids and rise or fall vertically due to their buoyancy in the presence of the grids .",
    "@xcite also studied the effect of tilting their rectangular sample by an angle of 0.17 rad .",
    "consistent with the very small effect of tilting on @xmath15 found by us , they found that within their resolution the heat transport remained unaltered .",
    "we observed that the sudden reorientations of the lsc that are characteristic of the level sample are strongly suppressed by even a small tilt angle .",
    "for the present work we used the  large \" and the  medium \" sample and apparatus described in detail by @xcite .",
    "copper top and bottom plates each contained five thermistors close to the copper - fluid interface .",
    "the bottom plate had imbedded in it a resistive heater capable of delivering up to 1.5 kw uniformly distributed over the plate .",
    "the top plate was cooled via temperature - controlled water circulating in a double - spiral channel . for the nusselt - number measurements a temperature set - point for a digital feedback regulator",
    "was specified .",
    "the regulator read one of the bottom - plate thermometers at time intervals of a few seconds and provided appropriate power to the heater .",
    "the top - plate temperature was determined by the temperature - controlled cooling water from two neslab rte740 refrigerated circulators .",
    "each apparatus was mounted on a base plate that in turn was supported by three legs consisting of long threaded rods passing vertically through the plate .",
    "the entire apparatus thus could be tilted by an angle @xmath0 relative to the gravitational acceleration by turning one of the rods . the maximum tilt angle attainable was 0.12 ( 0.21 ) rad for the large ( medium ) sample .",
    "the nusselt number was calculated using the temperatures recorded in each plate and the power dissipated in the bottom - plate heater .",
    "the side wall was plexiglas of thickness 0.64 cm ( 0.32 cm ) for the large ( medium ) sample .",
    "it determined the length @xmath3 of the sample . around a circumference",
    "the height was uniformly @xmath54 cm ( @xmath55 cm ) for the large ( medium ) sample .",
    "the inside diameter was @xmath56 cm ( @xmath57 cm ) for the large ( medium ) sample .",
    "the end plates had anvils that protruded into the side wall , thus guaranteeing a circular cross section near the ends .",
    "for the large sample we made measurements of the outside diameter near the half - height after many months of measurements and found that this diameter varied around the circumference by less than 0.1% .",
    "imbedded in the side wall and within 0.06 cm of the fluid - plexiglas interface were eight thermistors , equally spaced azimuthally and positioned vertically at half height of the sample .",
    "they yielded a relatively high ( low ) temperature reading at the angular positions where there was up - flow ( down - flow ) of the lsc .",
    "a fit of @xmath58 yielded the mean center temperature @xmath59 , the angular orientation @xmath49 of the lsc ( relative to the location of thermistor 0 ) , and a measure @xmath19 of the lsc strength .",
    "we expect the size of @xmath19 to be determined by the heat transport across a viscous boundary layer separating the lsc from the side wall . thus @xmath19 should be a monotonically increasing function of the lsc reynolds number @xmath21 because the boundary - layer thickness is expected to decrease with @xmath21 as @xmath60 , and because the azimuthal temperature variation carried by the lsc near the boundary layer increases with @xmath1 and thus with @xmath21 .",
    "however , the precise relationship between @xmath19 and @xmath21 is not obvious .",
    "experimentally we find , over the range @xmath61 and for the large sample , that @xmath19 is related to @xmath1 by an effective power law @xmath62 , whereas @xmath63 in this range , yielding @xmath64 .",
    "we would then expect that @xmath19 and @xmath21 will have a similar dependence on @xmath0 ( at least for small @xmath0 ) , albeit possibly with somewhat different coefficients .",
    "from time series of the @xmath65 taken at intervals of a few seconds and covering at least one day we determined the cross - correlation functions @xmath66 corresponding to signals at azimuthal positions displaced around the circle by @xmath67 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath68 ) .",
    "these functions are given by @xmath69\\times[t_j(t+\\tau ) -",
    "\\langle t_j(t)\\rangle_t ] \\rangle_t\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : corfunc}\\ ] ] we also calculated the auto - correlation functions corresponding to @xmath70 in eq .",
    "[ eq : corfunc ] , for all eight thermometers .",
    "initially each sample was carefully leveled so that the tilt angle relative to gravity was less than @xmath71 radian .",
    "later it was tilted deliberately to study the influence of a non - zero @xmath0 on the heat transport .",
    "the fluid was water at 40@xmath72c where @xmath73 k@xmath74 , @xmath75 @xmath76/s , and @xmath77 @xmath76/s , yielding @xmath8 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : transients]a we show the initial evolution of the top and bottom temperatures of the large sample in a typical experiment .",
    "initially the heat current was near zero and @xmath78 and @xmath79 were close to 40@xmath72c .",
    "the sample had been equilibrated under these conditions for over one day . near @xmath80 h a new temperature set point of 50@xmath72c was specified for the bottom plate , and the circulator for the top plate was set to provide @xmath81c . from fig .",
    "[ fig : transients]a one sees that there were transients that lasted until about 0.9 h ( 1.2 h ) for @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "these transients are determined by the response time and power capability of the bottom - plate heater and the top - plate cooling water and are unrelated to hydrodynamic phenomena in the liquid .",
    "figures  [ fig : transients]b and c show the evolution of the heat current . after the initial rapid rise until @xmath82 h the current slowly evolved further to a statistically stationary value until @xmath83 h. a fit of the exponential function @xmath84 to the data for @xmath85 h is shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : transients]c and yielded a relaxation time @xmath86 h. we attribute this transient to the evolution of the fluid flow .",
    "it is interesting to compare @xmath87 with intrinsic time scales of the system .",
    "the vertical thermal diffusion time @xmath88 is 467 hours .",
    "obviously it does not control the establishment of the stationary state .",
    "if we consider that it may be reduced by a factor of @xmath89 with @xmath90 , we still obtain a time sale of 1.78 hours that is longer than @xmath87 .",
    "we believe that the relatively rapid equilibration is associated with the establishment of the top and bottom boundary layers that involve much shorter lengths @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "it also is necessary for the large - scale circulation to establish itself ; but , as we shall see , its precise reynolds number is unimportant for the heat transport .",
    "in addition , the lsc can be created relatively fast since this is not a diffusive process .",
    "figure  [ fig : transients ] shows the behavior of the system only during the first six hours and does not exclude the slow transients reported by chill _",
    "et al . _ that occurred over time periods of @xmath93 hours .",
    "thus we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : n_of_t ] results for @xmath94 from a run using the large sample that was continued under constant externally imposed conditions for nine days .",
    "each point corresponds to a value of @xmath15 based on a time average over two hours of the plate temperatures and the heat current .",
    "note that the vertical range of the entire graph is only 0.8 % .",
    "thus , within a small fraction of 1 % , the results are time independent .",
    "indeed , during nearly a year of data acquisition for a @xmath47 sample at various rayleigh numbers , involving individual runs lasting from one to many days , we have never experienced long - term drifts or changes of @xmath15 after the first few hours .",
    "this differs dramatically from the observations of chill _",
    "et al_. who found changes by about 2 % over about 4 days .",
    "we conclude that the slow transients observed by them for their @xmath44 sample do not occur for @xmath48 .",
    "to document further the stationary nature of the system , we compared results from the large sample for @xmath15 obtained from many runs , each of one to ten days duration , over a period of about five months [ @xcite ] .",
    "the scatter of the data at a given @xmath1 is only about 0.1% .",
    "this excellent reproducibility would not be expected if there were slow transients due to transitions between different states of the lsc .",
    "although work in our laboratory with other aspect ratios has been less extensive , we also have not seen any evidence of drifts or transients for the larger @xmath95 and 6 [ @xcite ] nor for the smaller @xmath96 and 0.28 [ @xcite ] .",
    "it may be that @xmath44 , being near the borderline between a single - cell lsc and more complicated lsc structures [ @xcite ] , is unique in this respect .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : n_compare ] we compare results for @xmath97 from our large sample [ @xcite ] with those reported by chill _",

    "thus the lower values of @xmath15 ( compared to ours ) obtained by chill et al .",
    "for @xmath102 and @xmath44 can not be explained in terms of the @xmath39 and @xmath98 dependence of @xmath15 . some of the difference can be attributed to non - boussinesq effects that tend to reduce @xmath15 [ @xcite ] .",
    "however , for the largest @xmath29 used by chill et al .",
    "( 31@xmath72c ) we expect this effect to be somewhat less than 1 % [ @xcite ] .",
    "finally , the effect of the finite conductivity of the top and bottom plates comes to mind .",
    "this can reduce @xmath15 by several % when @xmath29 is large [ @xcite ] , but it is difficult to say precisely by how much .",
    "it seems unlikely that this effect can explain the entire difference , particularly at the smaller @xmath1 ( and thus @xmath29 ) where it is relatively small .",

    "[ fig : nred_of_beta ] . at the smaller rayleigh number of the medium sample the effect of @xmath0 on @xmath15 is somewhat less .",
    "because the effect of @xmath0 on @xmath15 is so small , we did not make a more detailed investigation of its rayleigh - number dependence .",
    "chill et al . proposed a model that predicts a significant tilt - angle effect on @xmath15 for @xmath44 where they assume the existence of two lsc cells , one above the other .",
