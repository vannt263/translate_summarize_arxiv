    "the question of reconciling supersymmetric dark matter scenarios with the standard evolution of the universe from very high temperatures was raised long ago  @xcite and addressed by many authors since ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is well known that with unstable gravitinos we face the so - called gravitino problem , as for example in generic gravity mediation scenarios of supersymmetry breaking with neutralino lightest supersymmetric partner ( lsp ) .",
    "if gravitinos are overproduced , their decay products can destroy the otherwise successful predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "this , in turn , leads to strong limits on the reheating temperature @xmath5 ( for a recent analysis see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , which may be in conflict with the higher temperatures required for thermal leptogenesis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting exception occurs when the gravitino is very heavy , @xmath6 , as in anomaly - mediated scenarios  @xcite or mirage mediation models of supersymmetry transmission to the visible sector  @xcite . such heavy gravitinos decay before the onset of nucleosynthesis .",
    "in scenarios with stable gravitinos , such as gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking , it is also generically dificult to reach high reheating temperature while maintaining consistency with the bbn bounds . in this case",
    ", the decay products of the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) threaten to alter bbn .",
    "further , if the gravitino is the only constituent of dark matter , which is the case considered in this paper , its cosmological abundance is fixed to be @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "gravitinos can be thermally produced in the post - inflationary universe , with the abundance proportional to the reheating temperature , @xmath8 , and also proportional to a factor depending on the precise superpartner spectrum .",
    "requirements on @xmath9 turn into requirements on @xmath5 for a given superpartner spectrum .",
    "the bbn constraints have been extensively studied both in a model - independent way and for specific choices of the nlsp . by a model - independent approach , we mean limits on @xmath10 , which is defined to be the number density normalized to entropy density @xmath11 , as a function of the nlsp lifetime @xmath12 , the nlsp mass @xmath13 and the branching ratios of its electromagnetic and hadronic decays ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for specific choices of the nlsp",
    ", this analysis can be done in a more precise way , since the decay modes of the nlsp can be studied in detail .",
    "most of the interesting nlsp candidates have already been discussed in the literature : neutralinos , staus , sneutrinos , stops and gluinos ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some general points are worthy of introductory note .",
    "first , the nlsp lifetime depends inversely on the ratio of the nlsp to gravitino masses . since we wish to have a fast decay lifetime so that decay products can thermalise before bbn finishes its work , one gets a lower bound for this ratio @xmath14 and , hence , also for the rest of the spectrum .",
    "precise numbers depend on details of the spectrum . also , more recently , it has been pointed out  @xcite that a very stringent bound exists for a charged nlsp from potential overproduction of @xmath15  @xcite . and",
    "finally , previous studies indicate that it is difficult to reconcile gravitino dark matter with a reheating temperature high enough for successful thermal leptogenesis ( for a recent discussion see  @xcite ) .",
    "our goals are to put details on all these points and more , and show that it is possible for constraints to be met in the context of a high reheat temperature needed for leptogenesis .",
    "we first systematically search for the patterns of supersymmetric spectra with gravitino lsp that maximize the reheating temperature consistently with the required gravitino relic abundance and the bbn bounds . since the stau nlsp ( @xmath16 ) and sneutrino nlsp ( @xmath17 ) have the smallest hadronic branching ratios , the bbn bounds are the weakest for these choices of light nlsp and we restrict our subsequent analysis to these two cases .",
    "one of the main features of the obtained spectra is that compatibility with all conditions and maximizing the reheat temperature pressures us away from universal gaugino masses at the high scale .",
    "in the second part of the paper we apply the techniques of general gauge mediation to see whether such spectra can indeed be obtained within a model of gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "gravitinos constituting the dark matter can be produced both thermally after inflation and nonthermally from nlsp decays .",
    "we shall focus first on the thermal component which can be written as @xcite : @xmath18 the sum runs over the standard model gauge groups and @xmath19 corresponds to @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the values of the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be extracted from  @xcite , and the coefficients @xmath25 parametrize the corrections to this result coming from novel gravitino production channels opening up in the presence of finite temperature corrections @xcite .",
    "numerically , @xmath25 are @xmath260.1 , 0.2 , 0.4 for @xmath19 and @xmath5 between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we are interested in maximizing the reheating temperature in eq .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) for @xmath29 .",
    "we shall come back shortly to the role of nonthermal production , but suffice it to say now that it plays a smaller role .",
    "we require consistency with all available bounds , particularly the bbn bound .",
    "it is natural and convenient to study the maximal possible reheating temperature as a function of the physical nlsp mass .",
    "this mass acts as the kinematical upper bound on the gravitino mass and as the lower bound for the rest of the physical masses of the mssm spectrum .",
    "furthermore , as we remind the reader later on , the bbn bounds can be expressed as bounds for the gravitino mass as a function of the nlsp mass .",
    "it is therefore convenient to rewrite the relation ( [ c1 ] ) in terms of the physical masses , with the nlsp mass introduced as the reference scale for the other masses : @xmath30 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 denote physical gaugino masses and the coefficients @xmath32 depend on the ratios of the gauge couplings at the reheating scale and the scale of the physical gaugino masses .",
    "the values of @xmath32 can be evaluated for @xmath33 as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , where the range for @xmath37 corresponds to the gluino masses ranging from 200 to 900 gev .",
    "we have used here the 1-loop rge for the gaugino masses .",
    "it is clear that the first condition for maximizing the reheating temperature for fixed @xmath38 and fixed nlsp mass is that the sum in eq .",
    "( [ c1a ] ) has its minimal value , i.e.  that the gaugino masses are completely degenerate with the nlsp mass .",
    "degenerate physical gaugino masses mean , of course , that they can not be degenerate at a high scale .",
    "this also means that the gluon and gluino thermal scattering is no longer the dominant source of gravitino thermal production , as would be the case if gaugino masses were universal at the high scale .",
    "this information is directly encoded in the values of the coefficients @xmath32 , which in turn , has serious implications for the constraints of the maximal reheating temperature consistent with the bbn bounds .",
    "this reasoning has been previously applied for constraining the gluino mass by successful leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "secondly , the maximal reheating temperature for a fixed @xmath13 is obtained for a gravitino mass that minimizes the square bracket in eq .",
    "( [ c1a ] ) . for a given type and mass of the nlsp",
    ", this value of @xmath39 may imply an nlsp lifetime for which its relic thermal abundance ( before it decays ) violates the bbn bounds .",
    "we must , therefore , discuss when this happens and find the maximal reheating temperature corresponding to the gravitino mass ( or , equivalently , the nlsp lifetime ) consistent with the bbn bounds .",
    "very generally , the bbn bounds require that unstable relics previously present in the universe , decay with lifetimes smaller than 100 s , unless the abundance of these particles is very small or only a tiny fraction of these particles decay with energetic hadrons in the final state  @xcite . among the mssm particles",
    ", the latter condition is satisfied by the lightest sneutrino or the lightest stau , hence its parameter space allows for @xmath40 .",
    "the cosmological constraints on late neutrino injection have been worked out  @xcite and later updated and specified to the sneutrino nlsp case  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that sneutrinos with masses smaller than about 330 gev evade the bbn constraints .",
    "such light sneutrinos are mostly constrained by the requirement that large scale structure formation is not too much affected by free - streaming gravitinos produced in the sneutrino decays  @xcite .",
    "numerically , this constraint is very similar to that resulting from the scenario s founding proposition that the gravitino is lighter than the sneutrino , @xmath41 . as we shall see shortly , the lighter the sneutrino the higher is the reachable reheating temperature and therefore we shall restrict our considerations to a sneutrino in the mass range between 200 and 330 gev .",
    "there is some uncertainty in the literature regarding the constrained region from bbn for sneutrinos ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "for example , the excluded thumb region in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , which we shall discuss shortly , may be uncertain to the left or right by @xmath42 .",
    "this level of uncertainty does not upset our analysis , as the region of light nlsp and maximal reheating temperature is above the thumb region for the lower sneutrino mass values .    for the sake of completness , we further emphasize how for heavier sneutrino nlsp the bbn constraints are especially restrictive .",
    "for @xmath43 between  300 and 500 gev the requirement that @xmath15 and d are not overproduced excludes gravitino masses between a few and a few tens of gev @xcite .",
    "the assumption that the hot component of the gravitino dark matter originating from the nlsp decays makes up at most 20% of the total dark matter energy density @xcite forbids @xmath39 too close to @xmath43 .",
    "finally , for still larger values of @xmath43 , between 500 and 900 gev , only solutions with light gravitino , with mass between a few and 10 gev , remain .",
    "since only light sneutrinos are of interest for us , there is no need to pursue a more quantitative study of how the bbn bounds depend on the mass spectrum of the mssm .    for stau nlsp with masses less than 1 tev ,",
    "the main bbn constraint is that of a correct primordial @xmath15 abundance coming from catalyzed @xmath15 production @xcite . we conservatively take it as @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this provides a constraint on the relic stau abundance as a function of its lifetime  @xcite .",
    "staus that decay faster than @xmath45 are generally safe and independent of relic abundance  @xcite ( but see @xcite for exceptions ) .",
    "we calculate the relic stau abundance with all other superpartners decoupled , and we use this result to obtain the upper bound on the gravitino mass as a function of the stau mass , while remaining consistent with the bbn bound .",
    "we stress that these bounds are rather robust : had coannihilations reduced the relic stau abundance by a factor of 10 ( or 100 , as is possible with an extreme gluino / stau degeneracy ) , the resulting bound on the gravitino mass would increase by a factor of 1.3 - 1.5 ( 3 - 4 ) and @xmath46 mass ranges would change little if we used a somewhat more ( less ) conservative @xmath47 bound . ] .",
    "the bbn bounds for sneutrino and stau nlsp discussed here are pictorially summarized by fig .",
    "[ f1 ] in the plane @xmath48 vs.  @xmath13 .     and @xmath49 ( short - dashed ) .",

    "the obtained values of the gravitino mass are slightly smaller than the nlsp mass , with their ratio being almost independent of the nlsp mass .",
    "the latter property suggests , from inspection of eq .",
    "( [ c1a ] ) , that the maximal reheating temperature will decrease with increasing nlsp mass .    for stau nlsp , as seen from fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the bbn bound puts an upper bound on the gravitino mass much below the stau mass .",
    "the first term in eq .",
    "( [ c1a ] ) is therefore negligible and the dependence of the reheating temperature on the nlsp mass is governed by the behaviour of the ratio of the maximal gravitino mass consistent with bbn to the nlsp mass multiplied by a linear function of the latter . as seen in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , this ratio increases faster than the nlsp mass itself .",
    "therefore , the maximal reheating temperature is expected to rise with the stau mass , in contrast to what we found for the sneutrino lsp .",
    "our plot begins at @xmath57 since , as we shall see , experimental limits require it after taking into account correlations with the other superpartner masses .",
    "we are now in a position to calculate the maximal reheating temperature for the sneutrino and stau nlsp . using eq .",
    "( [ c1a ] ) and including the gravitinos produced nonthermally in the nlsp decays , we obtain @xmath58 here , @xmath59 represents the thermal relic abundance that the nlsp would have had , had it not decayed into gravitinos and standard model particles .",
    "we calculate the value of this parameter with the micromegas.2.2 code @xcite , assuming that only the nlsp is light while all the other supersymmetric particles have masses of 2 tev . this choice is meant to eliminate nongeneric coannihilations which may be inherent features of particular scenarios of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "it turns out that in the parameter range that maximizes the reheating temperature nonthermal gravitino production is always well below 20% of the total , and our qualitative discussion of the thermal production explains the full results .",

    "this @xmath5 value is obtained by assuming the initial condition after inflation that there are zero @xmath66 particles , or in other words inflaton decay yields every kinematically accessible particle except the heavy ( s)neutrinos .",
    "the line ` thermal @xmath66 ' corresponds to the bound @xmath68 .",

    "@xmath66 ' assumes that only the lightest right - handed ( s)neutrinos @xmath66 have the initial condition of thermal equilibrium abundance after inflation , while all other particles are initially absent .",
    "there are effects that can make the bounds weaker and effects that make the bound stronger when some of our assumptions are altered .",
    "for example , we assume a very hierarchical mass spectrum among the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "bounds can be significantly relaxed for a mildly @xcite , very  @xcite or completely  @xcite degenerate mass spectrum .",
    "it must also be acknowledged that maximally efficient leptogenesis corresponds to a very particular corner of the parameter space of the seesaw mechanism ; hence , in a realistic model the lower bounds on @xmath5 given above may be generally higher . yet",
    "another example , the ` zero @xmath66 ' bound assumes no direct production of the right - handed neutrinos during reheating , which may not be a realistic option since couplings are likely to be generic between the inflaton and the right - handed neutrinos , which are all standard model singlets .",
    "therefore , leptogenesis bounds quoted here should be taken as indicative predictions of particularly simple scenarios rather than true cosmological constraints .",
    "on the other hand , given that the range of ` leptogenesis - friendly ' reheating temperatures partially overlaps with the range of @xmath5 giving a correct dark matter abundance consistent with the bbn , it is interesting to study scenarios in which the reheating temperature is maximized , as they are potentially least constrained by cosmology .",
    "there are two more well - known and universal constraints on the superpartner spectrum that must be taken into account .",
    "first , the lower experimental limit on the higgs boson mass implies a lower bound on the geometrical average of the stop masses . this is because raising the higgs mass is accomplished to leading order by a loop factor proportional to the logarithm of the stop masses . for small values of the @xmath70-terms , as in gauge mediation models ,",
    "the lower bound is about 1 tev .",
    "this bound gains special significance for model building in the presence of light gluinos , as we will see below .",
    "a challenging issue we will confront is the difficulty in obtaining small degenerate gaugino masses and stau or sneutrino nlsp while simultaneously producing squark masses heavy enough to lift the higgs boson above the current experimental limit .",
    "the second constraint , which will be addressed below , is requiring that the higgsino mass be heavier than the nlsp mass .",
    "the higgsino mass is governed by the @xmath71 parameter whose value must be consistent with a proper electroweak symmetry breaking potential .    in summary , we see that with stau as the nlsp , the maximal reheating temperature @xmath72 can be reached when its mass is greater than @xmath73 and almost degenerate with all the gaugino masses , and the gravitino is in the mass range @xmath74 . for sneutrino nlsp , the reachable reheating temperature @xmath75 is certainly in a range interesting for thermal leptogenesis .",
    "common to both cases of stau or sneutrino nlsp , the stop masses are around @xmath76 in order to satisfy current limits on the higgs boson mass , and the rest of the spectrum is not very constrained from the purely low - energy point of view .",
    "in particular , the obvious requirement that @xmath10 is as small as possible is of lesser importance , as discussed earlier .",
    "our next question is if such spectra can be obtained in gauge mediation models @xcite ( see also @xcite for a review ) . in supersymmetric models with gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking ,",
    "the gravitino is a well motivated dark matter candidate .",
    "it is automatically the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , stable if @xmath77-parity is conserved . indeed ,",
    "dominance of gauge mediation over gravity mediation implies a gravitino lsp , as can be readily seen , e.g. in the simplest gauge mediation model .",
    "with supersymmetry broken by a spurion @xmath78 coupled to a pair @xmath79 of messengers , the gauge mediation contribution to the soft scalar and gaugino masses is given by the scale @xmath80 , and the gravity mediation contribution to the gaugino and scalar masses is of the order of the gravitino mass @xmath39 .",
    "we seek a clear dominance of gauge mediation over gravity mediation sufficient to suppress dangerous fcnc transitions with random flavour changing insertions of the order of the gravitino mass  @xcite .",
    "this requirement implies @xmath81 . furthermore , since @xmath82 , and the gravitinos must be in the @xmath74 range , it is clear that for soft masses in the tev mass range , the messenger mass scale must be high , of the order of the gut scale too close to the sneutrino nlsp mass . ] .",
    "for definiteness in examples below , we fix this scale to be either @xmath83 gev or @xmath84 gev .",
    "these choices are conservative , in the sense that they allow for heavy gravitinos and high reheating temperatures .",
    "interestingly , values @xmath85 for the spurion vev are reachable in generic dynamical oraifeartaigh - type models of supersymmetry breaking coupled to gravity @xcite .",
    "our low - energy constraints for reaching maximal @xmath5 can be translated into conditions for the soft supersymmetry breaking masses @xmath86 at the messenger mass scale by using the rg evolution .",
    "we run the rg equations downwards in energy , ensuring proper electroweak symmetry breaking , and then study the correlations among other low - energy mass states .",
    "the choice of degenerate physical gaugino masses at the low scale , which maximizes the reheat temperature , implies that gaugino masses at the messenger scale do not satisfy the ",
    "universal \" initial conditions as in the minimal gauge mediation models . rather , their ratios at the high scale are approximately inversely proportional to the squares of the gauge couplings at @xmath87 . to realize this boundary condition one has to study generalized gauge mediation models  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore convenient to introduce already at this stage the most general parametrization of soft masses at the messenger mass scale in general gauge mediation models and to continue with the rg evolution using this parametrization .",
    "we shall later point out the qualitative conclusions , independent of the chosen high scale parametrization of the soft terms .    in general gauge mediation ( ggm )",
    ", the soft masses at the gauge mediation scale are given by @xmath88 where @xmath19 corresponds to gauge groups @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "for easier reference , the values of the casimir invariants are shown in table [ tcas ] .",
    "one can also use another description of the ggm models , defining @xmath89 .",
    "the renormalization group equations can be solved semi - analytically for small and moderate @xmath90 by means of the bottom - up method of ref .",
