    "the advent of web 2.0 has tremendously enriched researchers access to data . instead of observing eighteen monks for months waiting for something interesting to happen  @xcite , researchers now have access to approximately 160 million users 90 million daily tweets through twitter s api  @xcite . while these data tell us what people do online , it is less clear how much these data tell us about people in a broader context .",
    "social science researchers developed social networks as a methodological tool for understanding social phenomena , such as how individuals actions affect macro - level features of society , or how an individual s  location \" in a network affects his / her opportunities @xcite .",
    "sociologists have long distinguished between different types of networks @xcite .",
    "some examples are trust networks : from whom would you feel comfortable asking for $ 1000 ? ; friendship networks : with whom do you want to go out friday evening ; information networks : with whom do you discuss important matters ; and self - declared / articulated networks : who do you want the world to believe are your friends ?    social networks are not to be conflated with _",
    "online social networks _ such as livejournal , epinions , myspace , facebook , and twitter .",
    "we will use the terms _ contagious networks _ to denote networks that grow by adding new members where the new members are often  infected \" by their current social ties .",
    "the key property of contagious networks is that people often join these networks because they have a friend or acquaintance that is already a member .",
    "contagious networks include most _ online social networks _ because people are more likely to sign - up for such networks if they already have friends on them .",
    "citation networks , communications networks , collaboration networks , co - authorship networks , product co - purchasing networks may also be considered contagious networks .",
    "contagious networks provide much of the digital data we have about networks .",
    "the actions of joining and participating in these networks ( e.g. logging into livejournal , or coauthoring a paper ) are often captured digitally .",
    "hence , contagious networks provide a means for studying social questions pertaining to social networks by providing data .",
    "because contagious networks are spread over an underlying social network , it is natural to conjecture that these networks share many properties .",
    "however , it is difficult to know if this data generalizes past the digital world .",
    "the importance of this distinction is indicated by a familiar question ,  who in the room is friends with his / her mother on facebook ?",
    "\" however , even if no one were facebook friends with his / her mother would this meaningfully affect any large - scale measurements of the data ?",
    "does the sheer scale of such data render differences between the contagious networks and social networks to be mere annoyances or do these differences present a substantial obstacle to using data from contagious networks to make inferences about social networks .",
    "this is a key question that this paper hopes to address .",
    "we argue that the data from contagious networks is not tantamount to holding up a big mirror to our society ; it is more like looking at our society in a fun - house mirror  where things may appear very differently than they are .",
    "using computer simulations , we illustrate examples where the contagious network and the underlying network have very different properties .",
    "data mining has shown that many contagious networks share a few common features : heavy - tailed degree distributions , shrinking diameters , edge densification , and a particular  network community profile \" .",
    "we show , with computer simulations , that even though certain well - known network models ( e.g. the watts - strogatz model or a collection of cliques ) have none of these properties , if we use these models as an underlying network and grow contagious networks over them in a natural way , then the resulting contagious networks have all of these properties .",
    "we investigate various models of transmission and show that these results are robust to changes in the model .",
    "we study various parameter regimes to understand when our results hold .",
    "we also explore the theoretical mechanisms underlying our experimental results . in the case of degree distribution",
    ", we can prove that certain underlying structure will endow the contagious networks with heavy - tailed degree distributions even when the underlying network is regular .",
    "while these models are admittedly stylized , we believe that they are natural , and that these results give strong evidence of important implications , which we summarize here ; they are discussed in more detail in section  [ implications ] .",
    "( 1 )  these results provide a natural framework for developing generative models for contagious communities which capture the aforementioned four properties : start with a model for an underlying social network and model a contagion spreading over it .",
    "( 2 )  these results provide strong intuition that we need different models for social networks and contagious networks .",
    "it may be a mistake to import social network intuition into models for contagious networks .",
    "similarly , by datamining contagious networks , one expects to find attributes that are common amongst contagious networks ; however , these observations may not apply to the underlying social network .",
    "( 3 )  this helps make sense of the counter - intuitive results of leskovec et al  @xcite about network structure .",
    "these results make intuitive sense in context of contagious communities , but may not apply to other social networks .",
    "more speculatively , if we imagine these networks as being a community , it may allow leskovec et al to give us insight into the structure of communities as well .",
    "( 4 ) in a model where social networks are not created _ ex nihilo _ , but from existing social structures , contagious networks provide a sort of sampling technique for learning the underlying social network . while it may be impossible to directly infer the underlying social structure , more subtle techniques might work . in the section  [ section - potential networks ]",
    ", we pose the question : if contagious network data is akin to looking in a fun - house mirror , then what aspects of reality can we still reliably deduce from looking at this data ?",
    "after all , if you see feet and a head in a fun - house mirror , you can be fairly certain that there is a body in between .",
    "technology adoption as a process on a social network has been studied and documented before ; however , usually only the size of the cascade is considered .",
    "for example , in an experimental study , centola  @xcite creates online communities populated with volunteers and studies the spread of joining a health forum network over this strictly enforced underlying network .",
    "centola was mostly concerned with what types of underlying network structures would foster the largest cascade . for more examples , see chapters 6 and 9 of  @xcite .    here , we model on - line social network formation as technology adoption , and investigate how the network _ structure _ of the on - line social network is affected by the underlying social network structure .",
    "in fact , we condition on the size and so explicitly remove this variable from study .",
    "this phenomenon of network creation over existing structure extends to many settings beyond on - line communities .",
    "segal  @xcite observes that the best prediction of who would become friends at a certain police academy was the proximity of their last names in the alphabet ( this was presumably due to the frequent placement of the cadets in alphabetical order ) .",
    "thus the last names indicated a certain underlying social structure over which friendships eventually formed . in another study , also at a police academy , conti and doreian  @xcite show that seating assignments and squad assignments predict friendship ties . in this case",
    ", the study tries to manipulate the underlying social structure networks to foster inter - racial camaraderie at the academy .",
    "our results can be understood as trying to study the sampling bias resulting from the technology adoption process .",
    "the same person may interact over many differ types of technology ",
    "telephone , text , email , facebook , twitter  or without technology .",
    "each technology may be _ selectively _ used for particular communication needs .",
    "each user may use several distinct instances of the same technology ( e.g. a work and home telephone , several email accounts ) . to use this data to make assertions about social questions",
    ", we need to know that the data generalizes past the digital world , at least in the cases that we care about .    a series of work ( e.g.  @xcite ) points out a similar sampling bias in context of traceroute sampling . for example ,",
    "achlioptas , clauset , kempe , and moore  @xcite show that traceroute sampling finds power - law degree distributions even in regular random graphs ( which are very far from having a power - law degree distribution ) .",
    "a sampling bias caused by using traceroute sampling means a power - law distribution can be measured even when the underlying degree distribution is constant .",
    "however , traceroute sampling is fundamentally different than the cascading processes evaluated here.every infected node immediate infecting all uninfected neighbors but no internal edges which , as we will see , is outside the parameters that yield our results or that are interesting in our setting . ] in particular , unlike in the traceroute sampling case , running our models of cascades over erds - rnyi random graphs does not yield power - law or heavy - tailed degree distributions .",
    "thus it must be a different mechanism acting in each case .",
    "[ [ terminology ] ] terminology + + + + + + + + + + +    for expositional convenience and concreteness , throughout this paper we will use off - line friendship interchangeably with social network and as the canonical example of a social network .",
    "likewise , we will use on - line social networks and sometimes live journal in particular to be a stand - in for contagious networks . a sharp distinction between contagious and social networks",
    "is not always clear , but nonetheless we believe these generalizations are useful . also , not all on - line social networks are necessarily contagious communities as membership in some may not be spread primarily via an underlying social structure .",
    "while the language of cascades and adoptions is more accurate and traditional to describe the spread of some cultural artifact , we will interchangeably use the notation of a virus and infection because such terminology is it often more concise .",

    "section  [ section theoretical models ] presents some theoretical rational for these results . in section  [ implications ]",

    "in particular , the network community profile on the on - line social networks : livejournal , epinions , linkedin , del.icio.us , and flickr look nearly identical ( see @xcite pages 22 and 25 ) .",
    "they note that the plot decreases until around 100 , then it stays roughly even for a short period , and finally starts to increase .",
    "finally , they show that this tool yields completely different results on virtually all generative models ( except for one that they call the forest - fire model ) .",
    "leskovec et al were interested in studying the community structure on networks .",
    "they define a community as a set of nodes with low conductance ",
    "many edges within the set compared to the number of edges leaving the set . even in very large datasets of contagious networks , they found few large communities ( over 100 people ) that fit this definition .",
    "broadly speaking , they found that the structure of these graphs was composed of  whiskers \" and a  core \" . _",
    "whiskers _ are a set of nodes connected to the rest of the graph by only a one or a few edges .",
    "core _ is a big connected tangle with no subsets of small conductance .",

    "the _ conductance _ of a set denoted @xmath39 @xmath40 is equal to the number of edges leaving a set @xmath41 divided by the sum of the degree of the vertices in @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 , whichever is smaller ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath41 is insular and does not have many edges leaving it relative to its total degree , then @xmath41 has low conductance .",
    "the community network profile finds the set of each size @xmath43 with the lowest conductance and then plots this graph .",
    "i.e @xmath44 .    the network community profile is closely related to isoperimetric inequalities which are a mathematical subject concerned with minimizing the boundary for a given volume ( such as the circle in the plane ) , and thus showing that a large volume implies a certain sized boundary . here",
    "the  volume \" corresponds to the total degree and the  boundary \" corresponds to the number of edges leaving .",
    "in this section we will describe the results of our simulations .",
    "we compare the studied properties on the contagious networks and the underlying networks .",
    "overall , the simulations support our theory that contagious networks look like a cascade across simple network formation models .",
    "our results mainly apply to the beginning of a cascade .",
    "once the cascade reaches the entire graph , then by definition the underlying graph and cascade look the same .",
    "all simulations were done using the snap system  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important for the network community profile and diameter which are both approximated with heuristics .",
    "these heuristics were shown to work well in other graphs ( see section 5 of leskovec et al  @xcite ) , but that is no guarantee that they work well here .    unless specified otherwise , simulations were run on an underlying graph of 1,000,000 nodes with average degree 100 , using a rewiring parameter of @xmath45 and the random edge transmission models with @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we first describe the results when the watts - strogatz model is used as a potential graph .",

    "[ [ degree - distribution ] ] degree distribution + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    even though the degree distribution of the watts - strogratz model is highly concentrated , the resulting contagious networks have a degree distribution that resembles a heavy - tailed distribution ( see figure  [ degrees3 ] ) .",
    "this is especially surprising since the maximum degree of the original graph @xmath21 ( and hence the largest possible degree in @xmath27 ) was slightly over 100 in the trials we ran . eventually , the degree distribution looks like a truncated heavy - tailed distribution .",
    "that is , all the points present are in a straight line , but this tail suddenly stops when the underlying graph has no vertices with degree above a certain value .    after a large fraction of the underlying network becomes infected , we expect this effect to go away because the underlying networks does not have a heavy - tailed degree distribution .",
    "these plots hold to approximately straight lines until the cascade reaches 80,000 nodes at which point they started to diverge .",
    "after about 1/3 of the graph is infected , these plots begin to diverge substantially from the truncated heavy - tailed distribution .",
    "the same behavior was observed for all transmission types .",
    "however , if @xmath28 is made too low , or @xmath30 too high , then this behavior is not as prevalent .",
    "the extreme case where @xmath49 and @xmath50 , is very similar to the trace - route sampling setting . on regular graphs the contagious networks limit to a power - law degree distribution  @xcite , but the underlying graphs that we consider do not yield a contagious network with a heavy - tailed degree distribution for these settings of the parameters .",

    "figure  [ ncpfigure ] shows both the original network community profile of the watts - strogatz model and the network community profile of a virus spread over the network .",
    "this similarity holds up until about 1/3 of the vertices in the graph are infected .",
    "differing the population size and degree does not seem to affect the outcome .",
    "however , if the rewiring probability @xmath6 is made too large ( @xmath51 ) then the shape collapses ; the plot never decreases sufficiently .",
    "a similar pattern occurs if @xmath28 is not sufficiently large compared to @xmath30 ; the edges between nodes of the infected graph @xmath27 fail to fill in and no community structure is detected .",

    "[ [ degree - distribution-1 ] ] degree distribution + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we start with a theorem about a family of graphs closely related to the planted community model .    the _ planted clique model _ @xmath53 generates a graph on @xmath1 nodes by superimposing the edges from a degree @xmath54 regular random graph and from partitioning the nodes into @xmath55 cliques of @xmath56 nodes each .",
    "next we show that retig will produce a power - law degree distribution on such graphs .",
    "a power - law distribution with exponent @xmath57 is a distribution on the positive integers where @xmath58 such that @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath21 be a family of @xmath60 graphs where @xmath61 is a constant .",
    "then as @xmath1 increases , the degree distribution of the @xmath62 on @xmath21 after infecting @xmath63{n}$ ] nodes will limit to a distribution @xmath64 which is a power - law distribution with exponent @xmath65 .",
    "the proof follows from the following more general intuition about the yule distribution  @xcite .",
    "the yule distribution was created to model the following situation concerning species and genera : at each time step choose a random species and with probability @xmath66 the species creates a new species in the same genus , and with probability @xmath28 the species creates a new species in a new genus .",
    "the yule distribution describes the fraction of genera with a particular number of species in the limit of this process .",
    "the tail of this distribution limits to a power - law distribution with exponent @xmath67 .    in the @xmath68 graphs , in the limit of @xmath1 , a @xmath69 fraction of each vertices neighbors",
    "cliquish_in the same clique  and a @xmath70 fraction of its neighbors are _",
    "distant_in different cliques , i.e. neighbors via the random edges .",
    "let @xmath71 .",
    "think of @xmath6 being small so that @xmath38 is close to 0 , and consider a cascade over such a network .",
    "if we assume that the cliques are sufficiently large , that there are sufficiently many , and that the cascade has not been going too long ( so that each vertex has about the same number of non - infected neighbors ) , then when a new vertex is infected , it is like picking a random vertex in the cascade and infecting a random neighbor .",
    "this neighbor has a @xmath72 probability of being cliquish ( in the same clique ) and a @xmath38 probability of being distant ( in a different clique ) . because of this the number of nodes present in each clique closely follows a yule distribution with parameter @xmath38 , and thus limits to a power - law distribution with exponent @xmath73 .",
    "consider the induced subgraph of the cascade .",
    "the degree of each vertex will be equal to the number of cliquish and distant neighbors that are also included .",
    "the number of cliquish neighbors of a vertex is simply equal to the number of infected nodes in its clique . because the number of infected vertices in each clique limits toward a power - law distribution with exponent @xmath74 and a clique with @xmath56 infected vertices contains @xmath56 vertices of cliquish degree @xmath75 , the degree distribution of cliquish edges limits toward a power - law distribution with exponent about @xmath76 .",
    "thus the degree distribution will be a power - law with exponent @xmath77 .",
    "it turns out that distant neighbors contribute very little to a vertex s degree in comparison to the cliquish neighbors because the distant neighbors form a random graph .",
    "the theorem follows from the above intuition .",
    "thus in section  [ section simulation results ] we expect that in the retig model we have a power - law with exponent @xmath78 .",
    "we see in figure  [ degrees3 ] of section  [ section simulation results ] that the data fits this well .",
    "several things break down after the cascade continues to spread .",
    "first some vertices in the cascade may have a significant fraction of their neighbors in the cascade .",
    "alternatively , some clusters may have a significant fraction of vertices in the cascade .",
    "this means that these vertices ( or clusters ) are less likely than random to spread to a friend ( or gain a new adoptive member ) .",
    "secondly , as the cascade infects a significant number of nodes in the graph , a random edge may not spread the virus to a new area of the graph , but instead may reach an already infected area .",
    "while the watts - strogatz graph with rewire parameter @xmath6 is not a collection of cliques , it behaves in a similar manner to the above graph .",
    "locally , it looks a lot like a clique .",
    "if one imagines several locations of the watts - strogatz graph being infected , then each location is  clique - like \" in that most vertices in that location are neighbors . when a new vertex is included , with probability @xmath6 the link will be a rewired link and thus is likely to start a new location of the infection",

    "our forest fire model has one parameter @xmath85 , the burning probability .",
    "the model starts with a single node . at each time",
    "step a new node @xmath17 joins , chooses an existing node @xmath10 at random , and forms a link with @xmath10 . for each node @xmath86 that @xmath17 links to ( starting with @xmath10 ) , @xmath17 also links to @xmath87 of @xmath86 s neighbors where @xmath87 is chosen from a binomial distribution with mean @xmath88 .",

    "consider running @xmath52 on a low degree erds - rnyi random graph .",
    "when a vertex @xmath17 joins ( if the contagious network has not reached more than a small fraction of the total nodes ) , then it is very likely that @xmath17 is attached to exactly one node @xmath10 of the infected subgraph , @xmath27 , ( the vertex that caused @xmath17 s infection ) .",
    "the vertex @xmath17 can add more ties in the infected subgraph @xmath27 by  exploration \" on the infected subgraph through ties of @xmath10 in @xmath27 ( that is adding direct ties to neighbors of @xmath10 ) .",
    "each time that @xmath17 links to a neighbor @xmath86 of @xmath10 in @xmath27 , the next time step @xmath17 can add nodes to neighbors of @xmath10 as well .",

    "also in @xmath52 a vertex can additionally add ties by infecting neighbors in @xmath21 that are not yet in @xmath27 .",
    "thus it is not surprising that both of these models produce similar though not certainly not identical network community profiles .",
    "we think that there are several important implications from the above models and simulations .    * new generative model for contagious networks : * this intuition provides us with a new generative model for contagious networks .",
    "start with a social network model , and model a contagion spreading over it .",
    "we show that with certain modeling choices ( for example watts - strogatz with ret adaption ) this two - step simulation captures both the intuition of sociology research about social network models  small diameter  @xcite and local clustering  @xcite  and the datamining research on contagious networks  shrinking diameter and edge densification  @xcite , heavy - tailed degree distribution  @xcite , and a particular network community profile  @xcite  all in one simple and intuitive model .",
    "we acknowledge that our starting networks ( e.g. watts - strogatz ) are very stylized and not particularly realistic , and we leave it for future work to further develop this framework with more realistic underlying networks and adoption patterns .",
    "* contagious networks and social networks require different models : * we show that metrics that appear to test global properties ( e.g network community profile ) and metrics that appear to test local properties ( e.g. degree distribution ) may show dramatically different results on contagious networks and the underlying social networks .",
    "while this observation has been made before , we provide results that begin to show the scope and scale of the qualitative and quantitative differences .",
    "a long line of work seeks to study network generation models ( for examples see  @xcite ) .",
    "our results warn that it is unlikely that any one model will serve to generate realistic models for broad class of social networks .",
    "this remains true even if we only desire that our models capture fairly basic properties .",
    "indeed , we should not _ a priori _ expect all properties to be universal , and thus we should not _ a priori _ expect one generative model",
    ". one of the original motivations for sociologists to develop social network theory was to explain how social networks _ differ _ and to understand the implications of these differences .",
    "for example gans @xcite studied how boston s west end community was unable to form a coalition to fight an ",
    "urban renewal \" measure that ended up destroying the community , even though other seemingly similar communities were able to organize against and defeat such measures  @xcite and , moreover , how social structures could have contributed to this outcome .",
    "distinguishing the two tasks of modeling contagious networks and social networks gives a partial explanation for the difficulty in the task of creating realistic models . by not distinguishing the two tasks , on the one hand , social networks intuition",
    "is inadvertently imported into models of contagious networks .",
    "however , this intuition is found to be incorrect by datamining contagious communities . on the other hand , the counter - intuitive findings of datamining contagious networks",
    "is being advertently brought into social network models , where it makes little intuitive sense .",
    "if indeed social networks and contagious networks are different , this indicates that using data from contagious social networks may mislead us if we try to directly use it to understand social networks .",
    "there is selection bias toward datamining contagious networks because data is more easily available for this type of network .",
    "thus , we would expect datamining studies to find attributes that are common amongst contagious networks , but not necessarily present in social networks . yet , despite the prevalence of certain characteristics ( such as heavy tail degree distribution @xcite ) , models without these characteristics may still be valid in a wide variety of interesting settings .",
    "in particular , it may be that such characteristics are common to contagious networks , but are not found in many social networks . while we can not show that contagious networks are necessarily different from social networks on all these metrics , we do remark that if the intuition that guided the first generative models is correct ( which do not contain heavy - tailed degree distribution , shrinking diameter  @xcite , edge densification , and a particular network community profile  @xcite ) then such a discrepancy must exist .",
    "the counter - intuitive core and whisker structure found by  @xcite might accurately characterize actual social networks ; however , we feel that contagious networks is a more natural explanation of these observations .    at the same time",
    ", this distinction frees us from conforming to the intuition of sociologists when modeling contagious communities .",
    "leskovec et al  @xcite , already showed us that contagious networks are not as we would commonly believe them to be .",
    "some doubted the counter - intuitive results .",
    "our experiments provide intuition that supports their observations and show that natural cascades will lead to heavy - tailed degree distributions , edge densification , shrinking diameter , and certain network community profiles in contagious networks .",
    "more speculatively , this gives us an opportunity to _ re - imagine what a community is and what they look like _ through the results of leskovec et al .",
    "these contagious social networks can be seen as a _ community _ within an underlying social network .",
    "that is the nodes of livejournal form the `` livejournal community '' which is embedded in society .",
    "the livejournal network can be viewed both as a network in and of itself , but also as a community in a larger network .",
    "we can perhaps use the core / whisker model of leskovec et al to understand properties of communities .",
    "this model provides an alternate view of community structure compared to that metrics such as modularity  @xcite and conductance  @xcite .",
    "this view sees communities as gradually adding internal connections and external members who start on the periphery of the group but gradually gradually become more central to the community .",
    "communities are composed of whiskers and a core that has no insular communities .",
    "if dynamics similar to our model exist , then contagious social networks will , with high probability , contain properties for a range of underlying social networks even though these same underlying networks may or may not have these properties .",
    "we note that our results only hold when the network is fraction of the total graph .",
    "thus we think they would apply more to livejournal than facebook .",
    "additionally , as we already remarked , not all on - line social networks are necessarily contagious .",
    "for example , we do not expect the link structure of anonymous on - line support groups to be generated by a cascade over an underlying social structure",
    ".    it would be interesting to go beyond simulation data and attempt to verify this distinction between social networks and contagious networks on real data .",
    "however , it is not entirely clear what data set would be a good test . to a certain extent",
    ", this is really asking the impossible .",
    "how does one accurately measure a  trust \" network ( even between two people ) ? however , even in a limited context , it would be interesting to carry out such a study .      at the same time , these results point toward the opportunities ( and challenges ) of developing techniques for reconstructing the underlying social network from contagious network data . in a model",
    "where social networks are not created _ ex nihilo _ , but from existing social structures , contagious networks provide a sort of sampling technique for learning the underlying social network .",
    "one future line of inquiry is : what properties can ( and what properties can not ) be efficiently recovered ?",
    "we now suggest how future work could address this question .",
    "our model can be conceptualized in a framework that we call  potential networks \" .",
    "potential networks is a two phase model of social networks .",
    "the first phase is the  potential \" network .",
    "this network may not be directly observed or even exist an any normal manner .",
    "the second phase is the  behavioral \" network , which is observable .",
    "however , the behavior network is realized by running some random process over the potential network which samples vertices and edges from it to produce the behavioral network and in some cases adds additional edges .",
    "the key insight here is that we already have data from contagious networks and the process by which a contagious network grows acts  locally \" ties are added to the community two people at a time .",
    "ethnographic tools could be used to build a model of how a particular technology spreads based on interviewing individuals .",
    "thus , this process may be much easier to observe than the original underlying network .",
    "then , based on this model , the data might be reverse engineered to recover  global \" properties of the underlying network .    of course , real processes are more complicated than the models in this paper .",
    "however , we do not think that this formidable challenge is insurmountable . by better modeling",
    "how particular contagious networks grow , we may be able to use the vast amounts of data to reconstruct properties of the underlying social network .

    "they show via computer simulations that their heuristics for recovering a potential network , given the timing data from a series of outbreaks , can simultaneously give high precision and recall of the original edges .",
    "this model requires many cascades to be spread over the same nodes , while in the potential network setting , only one cascade is observed .",
    "questions similar to this have been looked at before in field of sampling theory , for example see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the techniques for reconstructing graph properties from sampled data is much smaller ; see chapter 5 in @xcite for a survey of such results .",
    "in fact , graphs have traditionally been hard to sample and this is part of the reason that the newly acquired large - scale data are so welcome .",
    "work by handcock and giles @xcite proposes a method of estimating properties from adaptively sampled networks by using maximum likelihood estimates over exponential graph models .",
    "moreover they show that their method does well on real test data .",
    "a key observation made here is that simply because the sampled graph data is not representative of the graph , does not mean that key attributes can not be reconstructed in a more clever way .",
    "however this work seems to rely on an assumption that fails in our setting : that which data are observed and which data remain unseen only depends on the observed data . in a cascade , the fact that the cascade does not reach a person , already indicates that the person is likely not tightly connected to many infected nodes .",
    "finally , there has been recent work on how to sample a network in a way that makes it easy to recover certain properties ( e.g.  @xcite ) , however , in our framework the way that the network is sampled is fixed .",
    "there are more results in sampling literature , but none seem to apply to the case where the part of the underlying graph that is observed depends on the underlying graph itself in a way that is not explicitly controlled by the sampler .",
