    "the analysis of the electronic structure of metal surfaces poses a big theoretical challenge : a suitable calculational tool is needed for large , interacting , and strongly inhomogeneous many - electron systems .",
    "more than thirty years since its first application by lang and kohn to the surface problem,@xcite little doubt exists that one method of choice for the fulfilling of this goal is density functional theory ( dft).@xcite dft aims to a microscopic understanding of atoms , molecules , clusters , surfaces , and bulk solids starting from the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics . in the kohn - sham ( ks ) implementation of dft,@xcite",
    "the complicated many - body problem is mapped to an effective single - particle problem , with particles subjected to an effective single - particle potential ( the ks potential ) .",
    "although this mapping is exact , it gives no clue as to how to calculate in practice the so - called exchange - correlation ( @xmath3 ) contribution to the ks potential .",
    "lang and kohn solved this problem by using the local density approximation ( lda ) for the surface problem .",
    "@xcite in lda , the @xmath3 potential at each point is taken to be that of a homogeneous interacting electron gas with the local density . since then",
    ", many authors have calculated the electronic properties of metal surfaces by using either the lda@xcite or further elaborations that incorporate non - local ingredients to the unknown @xmath3 functional.@xcite other schemes of the computational electronic - structure tool kit available for the investigation of solid surfaces are the fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) method,@xcite the @xmath4 approximation,@xcite quantum monte carlo ( qmc),@xcite and the inhomogeneous singwi - tosi - land - sjlander ( istls ) approach.@xcite    in the framework of the optimized effective potential ( oep ) scheme of dft , @xcite which had been first used in the context of atomic physics , @xcite correlation is ignored altogether and the exact - exchange ks potential is obtained .",
    "several advantages are associated with the use of the exact - exchange energy functional of dft : ( i ) it corrects the self - interaction problem inherent in approximate treatments of the exchange energy@xcite ( this problem is particularly acute for localized systems such as atoms and molecules , although it is not relevant for extended systems like bulk solids and solid surfaces ) ; ( ii ) it yields great improvements in the study of the ks eigenvalue spectrum,@xcite semiconductor band structures and excitations,@xcite and nonlinear optical properties ; @xcite ( iii ) it yields the correct asymptotics;@xcite ( iv ) it reproduces the derivative discontinuity which should be present in the ks exchange potential each time the number of particles crosses through an integer value;@xcite and ( v ) it yields the correct two - dimensional ( 2d ) exchange energy per particle in the case of a quasi-2d electron gas.@xcite it is the aim of this paper to provide _ benchmark _ exact - exchange oep calculations for jellium slabs , with the expectation that more accurate dft schemes that include correlation be developed by starting from a well founded exchange analysis and tested once reduced to their exchange - only ( @xmath5-only ) counterparts .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : we give in section ii the general theoretical background which will be used in the following sections ; section iii is devoted to a discussion of the asymptotic behaviour of the exact - exchange ks potential of jellium slabs ; in sections iv and v we give the results that we have obtained for the oep surface energy and work function , respectively , and in section vi we present the conclusions .",
    "our calculations are restricted to a jellium - slab model of metal surfaces , where the discrete character of the positive ions inside the metal is replaced by a uniform distribution of positive charge ( the jellium ) .",
    "the positive jellium density is defined as @xmath6 which describes a slab of width @xmath7 , number density @xmath8,@xcite and jellium edges at @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; @xmath11 represents the heaviside step function : @xmath12 if @xmath13 and @xmath14 if @xmath15 . a schematic view of our jellium slab is given in fig .  1 . besides , and for convenience for the numerical calculations , infinite barriers are located far from the jellium edges , well inside the left and right evanescent vacuum regions .",
    "we have checked that these infinite barriers are located far enough for all the numerical calculations presented here to be independent of their precise location .",
    "@xcite the jellium - slab model is invariant under translations in the @xmath16 plane , so the ks eigenfunctions can be factorized as follows @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the in - plane coordinate and wave - vector , respectively , and @xmath20 represents a normalization area .",

    "finally , we have performed @xmath5-only oep calculations of the work function of jellium slabs , again as a function of the slab width @xmath7 .",
    "we have found that the oep work function exhibits large quantum size effects that are absent in the lda and which reflect the intrinsic derivative discontinuity of the exact ks potential .",
    "the amplitude of this discontinuity diminishes as the slab width increases , and becomes arbitrarily small as @xmath167 , i.e , in the case of a semi - infinite system .",
    "this has been proved both analytically and numerically .",
    "we also note that although the precise value of the @xmath5-only oep work functions reported here would change with the inclusion of correlation , the exact slab work function is expected to exhibit the large quantum size effects and discontinuities observed in the present work , barring possible accidental cancellations of exchange - driven and correlation - driven contributions to the total discontinuity .",
    "the presence of these large discontinuities in the @xmath5-only oep slab work function ( and presumably also in the actual work function that includes correlation ) highlights the potential danger in which can be incurred by performing elaborated calculations for a restricted set of slab sizes without performing a suitable and reliable extrapolation towards the semi - infinite case .    in summary",
    ", we expect that the _ benchmark _ exact - exchange oep calculations reported here for jellium slabs will serve as motivation and as a starting point for the development of more realistic approximations for the exchange - correlation energy functional of jellium and real surfaces .",
