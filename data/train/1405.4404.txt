    "room temperature atomic vapors are a popular medium for quantum information processing .",
    "perhaps , they offer the simplest approach to quantum repeaters @xcite , quantum memory @xcite and numerous other quantum - enhanced protocols possible with deterministic light - atom interface @xcite and long - lived ground state coherence .",
    "room temperature vapors can be effectively utilized in two distinct ways .",
    "atoms can be placed in a paraffin coated cell without a buffer gas which they traverse multiple times during the interaction so that their quantum state is symmetric with respect to the permutations and within the holstein - primakoff approximation the cell holds a single bosonic mode @xcite . at the opposite extreme ,",
    "the atoms are kept in a buffer gas which should virtually immobilize them . then transverse and longitudinal patterns can be stored and interfaced to @xcite .",
    "room temperature vapors can also be a very effective four - wave mixing medium @xcite and a source of spatially multimode squeezing @xcite with a potential for quantum imaging @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we characterize a multimode generator of temporally separated random image pairs with a raman interface .",
    "the images are formed at the write - in and the read - out of atomic excitations , accomplished by driving a spontaneous stokes and a stimulated anti - stokes scattering respectively . at the write stage",
    "we create a random scattered stokes field , which forms a speckle pattern in the far field .",
    "it results from interference of distinct spatial modes . at the same time coupled distribution of excitations arises within the atomic sample @xcite .",
    "this can be thought as a storage of the random but known image in the atomic memory . after a certain time",
    "the excitations can be converted to the anti - stokes scattered light .    in the experiments we use rubidium-87 vapor mixed with a buffer gas .",
    "we measure the effects of diffusion and deterioration of the effective optical depth due to the collisional broadening .",
    "we quantify the spatial multimode characteristics and a capacity of the generator . in general this task",
    "is accomplished either by measuring field coherence @xcite or by measuring second order hanbury - brown twiss type correlations @xcite .",
    "we have chosen to measure the latter , i.e. statistical correlation between intensity fluctuations in various scattering directions from large sets of single - shot images similarly as in @xcite .",
    "we show that the results are consistent with a simple theoretical model @xcite .    in this particular operating regime",
    "we produce multiple correlated modes of radiation that are released at separate time instants , first in the stokes scattering process , second in the anti  stokes scattering @xcite .",
    "this is similar to recent work demonstrating entangled images @xcite , however in our generator the second image can be held in memory until the first image is processed or a suitable moment comes .",
    "in contrast to previous work @xcite it is achieved without resorting to additional , separate quantum memory implemented in another atomic ensemble .",
    "in this article we examine purely classical properties of the correlated images .",
    "we focus on spatial properties of light and understanding atomic decoherence .",
    "however , we note that our source shares a number of features with sources of non - classical light based on atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "our main motivation for the present study was that of possible future applications in multimode quantum information processing @xcite , particularly involving spatially multimode squeezing which has attracted large attention recently @xcite .",

    "next , a pencil - shaped region is illuminated with a strong write beam .",
    "this induces scattering of anti - stokes photons and creation of a spin wave corresponding to coherent excitation of atoms into f=2 state .",
    "the scattering grows exponentially due to the boson nature of the fields involved .",
    "we stop it when tens of thousands of excitations have been produced .",
    "after that we wait for an adjustable amount of time and illuminate the atomic sample with the read beam .",
    "it is tuned in order to cause scattering of stokes photons at the expense of the atomic excitations .",
    "it can be thought that the read beam probes the atomic coherence by converting it to the light .    in the write process",
    "the difference of wave vectors between the annihilated write laser photon and the created stokes one @xmath8 is mapped onto the spatial phase of an atomic excitation .",
    "the excitation takes on a form of a coherent spin wave and acquires a wave vector @xmath9 . at the readout stage",

    "this sets the fundamental limit on the number of independent modes which may be simultaneously stored in the atomic memory . since the scattered light couples to the respective spin wave @xmath7-vectors the distinguishability of various @xmath7 components of the atomic excitation also imprints on the scattered light .",
    "conversely , this implies the emission into close directions has to be correlated i.e. the light in the far field exhibits a finite coherence area .",
    "in addition the stokes scattering process populates only certain superpositions of the distinguishable spatial modes .",
    "one of the easiest way to analyze it is to decompose the atomic excitations and likewise scattered light into a pairwise coupled basis , in which each light mode is coupled with exactly one atomic mode .",
    "the obtained light modes are all centered around the write beam @xmath3 while the spin wave modes around the origin of the @xmath7-vector space .",

    "the width of the fundamental spin wave mode is approximately @xmath18 .",
    "the associated fundamental light mode is a gaussian beam with a confocal parameter close to the sample length @xmath15 .",
    "the raman growth parameters of higher order modes slowly diminish along with mode number .",
    "typically the number of significantly excited modes is close to the fresnel number of the write beam @xmath19 if the decoherence is neglected @xcite . during each single write",
    "pulse stokes modes are populated .",
    "they produce a speckle - like diffraction pattern in the far field .",
    "note that each speckle is not a single mode but an interference of many modes excited with random amplitudes and phases .",
    "thus , every speckle has a different position , size and amplitude .",
    "yet , an approximate average size of the speckle can still be worked out from the mode picture . given",
    "@xmath20 similarly populated laguerre - gaussian modes we typically find single spots in their interference pattern to occupy about @xmath21 of the solid angle of the fundamental mode , because the central lobe of the @xmath22-th mode is @xmath23 times thinner than the extent of the fundamental mode .",
    "this is also equal to the coherence area of the image .",
    "conversely , the solid angle of the entire pattern is @xmath20 times bigger than the solid angle of a single coherence area assuming @xmath20 modes are populated .",
    "this can be justified twofold .",
    "firstly @xmath20 modes interfere to @xmath20 independent coherence areas with uncorrelated intensities .",
    "secondly the size of the pattern is determined by the highest order mode , which has @xmath24 times bigger solid angle than the fundamental mode which in turn is @xmath24 times bigger than the coherence area .",
    "note , that the above are approximate statements as the population of consecutive modes is diminishing slowly and the threshold above which the modes are counted as populated is vague .",
    "therefore the number @xmath20 is approximate .    in the experiment ,",
    "the number of excited modes is limited by the diffusion .",
    "this is because high order modes are composed of components with large @xmath7 which correspond to abrupt spatial variations .",
    "they are easily washed off by diffusion of the atoms in a buffer gas during the storage .",
    "therefore in the experiment we expect the number of retrieved modes @xmath20 to be lower than the fresnel number of the write beam @xmath25 .",
    "in our generator we observe an image created by stokes photons and anti - stokes photons in the far field , @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively . in the ideal case of a plane - wave write and",

    "@xmath14 we expect the ideal images to be blurred due to beams wave vector spread .",
    "the true images should be close to the convolution of atomic excitations distribution in the sample with the read beam distribution in @xmath30-space .",

    "they were detuned from the @xmath35 transition by 1 ghz to the red and by 1 ghz from the @xmath32 transition to the blue respectively .",

    "[ fig : general ] was produced by acousto - optical modulators .",
    "the pump pulse duration 780  @xmath36s and its 4.2 mm full width at @xmath37 waist diameter ensured bleaching of the medium in the volume were the raman scattering took place .",
    "the write pulse started immediately after the pump pulse .",
    "the @xmath37 beam diameter was 2.16  mm .",
    "pulse duration varied from 200  ns to 10  @xmath36s and the power up to 17 mw .",
    "after the write pulse we inserted a variable storage delay . finally a read pulse was directed onto the cell and converted the spin waves into anti - stokes photons .",
    "the @xmath37 beam diameter was 1.76  mm .",
    "the read beam was tilted by 13  mrad with respect to the write beam in order to direct the scattered photons onto separate regions on the camera .",
    "all beams crossed inside a cylindrical quartz cell ( precision glassblowing ) , 100 mm long and 25 mm in diameter , which contained isotopically pure @xmath33rb  .",
    "the cell was mounted inside a two - layer magnetic shielding and was heated with bifilar wound copper coils .",
    "for comparison we used three cells containing different buffer gas , 1 torr or 0.5 torr krypton or 5 torr neon .",
    "the scattered light was separated from the write and read beams on a wollaston polarizer .",
    "the residual laser background was then absorbed in the hot @xmath31rb  cell .",
    "we decided to use this method due to its simplicity but one may alternatively use fabry - perrot interferometers @xcite .",
    "an interference filter was used to dump the 780  nm fluorescence emitted during the initial pumping .",
    "we checked that the laser background was of the order of a few photons per sequence and it was negligible compared to the residual fluorescence background and the camera noise .",
    "we focused the far field of the raman light onto an electron multiplier ccd camera ( imageem , hamamatsu ) .",
    "we calibrated the position on the camera with respect to the beam propagation angle inside the cell .",
    "the pixel pitch corresponded to 76 @xmath36rad angle inside the cell .",
    "we also calibrated sensitivity with a power meter .",
    "since the overlapping write and read beams were tilted with respect to each another , the corresponding stokes and the anti - stokes scattering light fell on distinct regions of the sensor .",
    "the camera was incapable of resolving the light temporally and we always captured both the stokes and the anti - stokes scattering integrated over the duration of write and read pulse . for each setting of the pulse lengths , powers and the storage time we captured 500 or 10000 separate images of the scattered light with a cycle rate of about 90",
    "hz . despite the usage of an interference filter before the camera we had some background coming from spontaneous emission in the pumping process",
    ". thus the reference set of 100 frames with pump and write beams was saved for background subtraction .",
    "we find that 500 frames are sufficient to calculate the average intensity of the scattered stokes and anti - stokes light @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "the average intensities presented below were calculated subtracting the background .",
    "the main origin of the background was the stray fluorescence of the atoms emitted during pumping .",
    "it was sufficiently stable to calculate it with high precision from 100 frames .",
    "we find that the average intensity of the scattered light was symmetric around the driving beam .",
    "therefore we averaged it with respect to the polar angle to obtain @xmath40 and @xmath41 with better signal to noise ratio .",
    "for calculating second order moments , including intensity correlations , we collected data sets containing 10000 frames .",
    "atom density in the main @xmath33rb  cell was estimated by measuring the absorption spectrum for the write laser attenuated to a fraction of saturation intensity right before the cell .",
    "the result was fitted with a theoretical model to estimate the gas temperature and absorption at resonance .",
    "cell heater temperature , measured by the resistance of the windings , was adjusted so as to obtain a doppler - broadened optical depth of 130 .",
    "the stability of the setup was verified by repeating this measurement prior to and right after the proper experimental sequence .",

    "therefore we conclude that the relation between number of modes and fresnel number of the excited portion of the sample can be used for designing future experiments .",
    "in a similar manner we can calculate the number of retrieved modes as a function of time . for each storage time",
    "we calculate the average width of the anti - stokes scattering and the correlation function .",
    "the result of estimated number of retrieved spatial modes is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes ] .     as a function of storage time . ]",
    "we can see that only for 1 torr krypton the number of retrieved modes in significantly greater than one , but still much lower than the number of stored modes we calculated .",
    "we suspect that this sudden drop results from a doppler broadening in the atomic sample .",
    "the spin waves are imprinted on different velocity classes with varying phases @xcite that are inconsistent between write and read stages .",
    "in this article we characterize the performance of a multimode delayed random image generator in which correlations are mediated between the beams via a spin wave excitation in the warm rubidium vapor .",
    "we turned our attention to the experimental characterization of the spatial behavior of the collective raman scattering .",
    "in particular we quantified the influence of buffer gas pressure on the diffusion and pair production rate in the stokes scattering .",
    "we measured the exponential decays of the spin waves to characterize the decoherence from atomic diffusion and we determined the diffusion constants for three different buffer gases .",
    "we compared these results to the angular dependence of the stokes scattering growth parameters and found that it is dominated by the evolution of the fundamental most occupied mode .",
    "we calculated the number of independent spatial modes excited in the generator .",
    "we showed how many can be retrieved after a certain storage time .",
    "our results concerning the mode structure of scattered fields are consistent with a simple multimode model which permits space - time separation @xcite .    in future applications one may attempt to increase the number of modes .",
    "our results suggest two ways to achieve that .",
    "one can apply the larger driving beam diameter .",
    "the number of modes , determined by the fresnel number , is expected to grow quadratically with a driving beam diameter if constant laser intensity is applied .",
    "an increase of a beam diameter would also shorten the wave vectors of the excited spin waves , making them more resilient to diffusion . the other way to increase",
    "the number of modes is to slow down the atomic diffusion keeping a collisional decoherence low .",
    "our results indicate a need for further comparisons of various buffer gases to find an optimum . this type of experiment could be also implemented in cold atomic gases and possibly in doped crystals .    in this work we studied only classical properties of the light generated .",
    "however , based on a number of similar successful experiments @xcite we conjecture the conclusions on the spatial properties of the light would stay valid also in the low light quantum regime .",
    "our results could therefore be of use for a number of emerging multimode quantum technologies .",
    "in particular the quantum information processing protocols devised for warm atomic samples could benefit from multimode capacity of the storage , because a single cell operated in multimode regime is equivalent to multiple single mode cells .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with thomas fernholz and czesaw radzewicz as well as generous support from konrad banaszek .",
