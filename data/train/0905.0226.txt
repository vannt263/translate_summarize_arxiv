    "the theory of mixtures considers generally two different kinds of continua : homogeneous mixtures ( each component occupies the whole mixture volume ) and heterogeneous ones ( each component occupies only a part of the mixture volume ) .",
    "at least four approaches to the construction of two - fluids models are known.the first one for studying the heterogeneous two - flows is an averaging method ( ishii @xcite ; nigmatulin @xcite ) .",
    "the averaged equations of motion are obtained by applying an appropriate averaging operator to the balance laws of mass , energy , etc ... , valid inside each phase @xcite . a second approach known as landau method bowen",
    ", landau was used for the construction of a quantum liquid model and was purposed for the homogeneous mixtures of fluids @xcite . for the total mixture",
    ", the method requires the balances of mass , momentum , energy , complemented with the galilean invariance principle and the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "a third approach is presented in extended thermodynamics ; the mixtures are considered as a collection of different media co - existing in the physical space .",
    "this approach is done in the context of rational thermodynamics @xcite founded on the postulate that each constituent obeys the same balance laws as a single fluid muller , et , rs .",
    "the thermodynamical processes must verify the second law of thermodynamics and it is possible to purpose phenomenological constitutive equations which allow to obtain the structure of constitutive or production terms ( as fick s law , fourier s law etc . ) and to close the system of equations .",
    "there exists a different approach based on the hamilton principle which is used for the construction of conservative ( non - dissipative ) mathematical models of continua .",
    "the principle was initiated by lin @xcite , serrin serrin and many others to obtain the governing equations of one component continua @xcite and involves an hamilton action .",
    "the variations of the hamilton action are constructed in terms of virtual motions of continua which may be defined both in lagrangian and eulerian coordinates @xcite.here , we use variations in the case of fluid mixtures .",
    "the variational approach to the construction of two - fluid models has been used by many authors ( bedford & drumheller @xcite ; berdichevsky berdichevsky ; geurst @xcite ; gouin @xcite ; gavrilyuk & gouin @xcite ; gouin & ruggeri @xcite ) . to study thermodynamical processes by the hamilton principle",
    ", the entropy of the total mixture or the entropies of components are added to the field parameters instead of temperatures .",
    "the lagrangian is the difference between the kinetic energy and an internal potential per unit volume depending on the densities , the entropies and the relative velocities of the mixture components ( and a potential due to external forces ) .",
    "the internal potential per unit volume can be interpreted as a legendre transformation of the internal energy . in this case , it is not necessary to distinguish molecular mixtures from heterogeneous fluids when each component occupies only a part of the mixture volume @xcite",
    ". consequently , the terms including interaction between different components of the mixture do not require constitutive postulates difficult to interpret experimentally .",
    "they come from the direct knowledge of the internal potential per unit volume .",
    "the assumption of a common temperature for all the components is open to doubt for the suspensions of particles @xcite as well as in the mixtures of gases in the early universe @xcite . by using the hamilton principle ,",
    "the existence of several temperatures ( one temperature for each component ) must be associated with the existence of several entropies ( one specific entropy for each component ) . that will be the aim of this paper : the internal potential per unit volume is a function of the densities , the entropies and the difference of velocity between components.the plan of the article is as follows : in section 2",
    ", we formulate an extended form of the hamilton principle of stationary action allowing to produce the governing equations of motion for each component of a binary mixture . from the invariance of time",
    ", we deduce an equation of the exchange of heat between components . with two temperatures ( one temperature for each component ) , the system of governing equations together with the balance of masses",
    "is not closed : hamilton s principle is not able to get a complete set of equations when exchange of energies occurs between components . in this case , we need an additive constitutive equation to close the system . in section 3 , we obtain a gibbs dynamical identity .",
    "this identity allows to obtain the equation of energy for the total mixture .",
    "the equation of motion for the total mixture and the equation of energy are in divergence form ; as in @xcite , it is not the same for the component equations of motion . in section 4",
    ", we consider the case of weakly dissipative mixtures and introduce an average temperature of the total mixture .",
    "the average temperature corresponds to a local equilibrium different from the real state , with nonequal component temperatures but with the same total internal energy .",
    "the total pressure of the mixture in the real state is different from the pressure associated with the mixture at the local equilibrium ruggeri3,ruggeri2 .",
    "the entropy variation rate of the mixture must be in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics which implies an additive constitutive equation for the pressure .",
    "the constitutive equation depends on the physical properties of the two constituents and we focus on the fact that the new pressure term does not obey the same rule than the other terms due to dissipation . in section 5 , as an example , we reconsider the special case of a mixture of perfect gases .",
    "finally , we compare our results with the conclusions obtained in @xcite by using classical arguments of rational thermodynamics .",
    "in a galilean system of coordinates , the motion of a two - fluid continuum can be represented by two diffeomorphisms @xmath0 or @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes eulerian coordinates in a four - dimensional domain @xmath3 in the time - space and @xmath4 denotes lagrangian coordinates of the component @xmath5 in a four - dimensional reference space @xmath6 .",
