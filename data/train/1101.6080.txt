    "this implies an s2 signal of 8.5 electrons , and the ionization yield @xmath95  electrons / kev is about @xmath45 below the value obtained in @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that in order for electronic excitation to result from a two - body collision between a projectile ( the recoiling atom ) and an atomic electron , the maximum possible energy transfer in the collision must exceed the band gap energy e@xmath96 of the target @xcite .",
    "this condition can be expressed in terms of the projectile velocity @xmath97 and the electron velocity @xmath98 as e@xmath99 @xcite .",

    "the electron density @xmath101 is calculated only for the valence electrons @xcite .",
    "this follows from the assumption of a `` free and independent electron gas . '' for insulators or semiconductors , the situation is less clear .",
    "if all 54 electrons in a xenon atom are considered , the requisite projectile velocity which satisfies the inequality ( with e@xmath102  ev in xenon @xcite ) implies a cutoff in electronic excitation below a nuclear recoil energy e@xmath103  kev @xcite .",
    "we suggest that it is more physical to calculate @xmath104 under the assumption that the fermi level e@xmath105 lies at the midpoint of the energy gap @xcite . for xenon",
    "this implies an effective 3 valence electrons per atom , with a predicted kinematic cutoff in electronic excitation below e@xmath106  kev . considering fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we do not see significant evidence for any kinematic cutoff in excess of the lindhard prediction .",
    "applying similar reasoning to germanium , one would consider an effective @xmath107 valence electrons per atom in calculating @xmath104 , and predict a kinematic cutoff below e@xmath108  kev .",
    "again , no evidence for such a cutoff is observed @xcite .",
    "a simple interpretation of this is that direct two - body collisions are not the dominant electronic energy - loss mechanism for recoiling atoms .",
    "indirectly suggest as much @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the quenching of electronic excitation from nuclear recoils in liquid xenon appears well - described by the prediction of lindhard _",
    "@xcite when taking the appropriate measure of electronic excitation , i.e. the combined energy scale given by eq .",
    "further measurements with reduced uncertainty will be needed to elucidate the correct value of @xmath18 in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] , and we have provided three specific suggestions for achieving this .",
    "we have urged the adoption of the combined energy scale for nuclear recoils , with the photon and electron fractions describing the signal partitioning .",
    "this has the distinct advantage of allowing comparison with the quenching theory of lindhard _",
    "et al . _ , and the recombination model of thomas and imel .    for direct detection experiments with null results ,",
    "the choice of energy scale has a negligible effect on exclusion limits .",
    "however , one eventually expects to observe nuclear recoils from the scattering of dark matter @xmath109 optimistically , in the @xmath110 live days of blinded data so far accumulated by the xenon100 collaboration . at that juncture",
    "it will be essential to obtain the most accurate reconstruction of the true recoil energy .",
    "we illustrate this point with a simple example , considering the recent xenon100 result ( fig . 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "suppose there were two hypothetical nuclear recoil events a and b , both with @xmath111  photoelectrons , but with event a having log@xmath112 , and event b having log@xmath113 .",
    "the s1-only energy scale employed in @xcite assigns the same e@xmath114  kev to both events .",
    "in contrast , the combined energy scale ( eq . [ eq1a ] ) assigns e@xmath115  kev to event a , and e@xmath116  kev to event b , in recognition of the smaller electron signal .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the fraction of energy given to electrons ( @xmath1 ) is expected to ( and in fact appears to ) decrease with decreasing e@xmath2 .",
    "but the rate of decrease of @xmath4 does not necessarily follow the same slope .",
    "this is a consequence of recombination , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . as of this writing , a direct calibration of the available signal from nuclear recoils with energies @xmath117",
    "kev has remained out of reach . yet",
    "broad - spectrum neutron calibration data @xcite , indicate that liquid xenon direct detection experiments have achieved a sensitivity to nuclear recoils of lower energy .",
    "the question of _ `` how much lower ? '' _ has necessarily relied on extrapolations of @xmath4 . in the absence of any theoretical expectation , a reasonable choice has been to assume that @xmath118 ( flat ) for @xmath117  kev @xcite .",
    "we have already shown that this is incompatible with theoretical expectations , if @xmath21 .",
    "it remains so even if we optimistically assume that lindhard s calculation of @xmath20 is correct .",
    "for example , the expectation at e@xmath119  kev is then @xmath120 for @xmath84 , and @xmath121 for @xmath93 . given that in all reasonable cases , theoretical expectations suggest that @xmath4 should decrease with decreasing e@xmath2 , it is difficult to support the more aggressive of the two exclusion limits ( solid curve , fig . 5 of @xcite ) proposed by the xenon100 collaboration .",
