    "the intermediate - band photometric system ( 1966 ; crawford 1975 ; bond 1980 ; schuster & nissen 1988 , hereinafter sn88 ) presents several indisputable advantages when compared with broad - band photometric systems such as the johnson - cousins - glass system ( johnson & morgan 1953 ; cousins 1976 ; bessell 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "the key advantages of photometry for a- to g - type stars are : _ i _ ) the ability to provide robust estimates of intrinsic stellar parameters such as the metal abundance ( the @xmath18 index , richter et al .",
    "1999 ; anthony - twarog & twarog 2000 , hereinafter att00 ; hilker 2000 , hereinafter h00 ; hilker & richtler 2000 , hereinafter hr00 ) , the surface gravity ( the @xmath19 index ) , and the effective temperature ( the @xmath20 index , nissen 1988 ; olsen 1988 ; att00 ) .",
    "the @xmath20 index is marginally affected by reddening , and therefore can also be compared to a simple color such as   to provide individual estimates of reddening corrections ( nissen & schuster 1991 ) .",
    "the same outcome applies to the reddening free @xmath21 $ ] index , and indeed theoretical and empirical evidence ( _ e.g. _ , stetson 1991 ; nissen 1994 ; calamida et al .",
    "2005 ) suggests that a simple color such as  compared to @xmath21 $ ] ( which is a temperature index for stars hotter than 8,500 k ) provides a robust reddening index for blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "_ ii _ ) the ( @xmath21 $ ] , ) color - color plane provides robust estimates of the age of galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) , since it is completely independent of cluster distance and marginally affected by uncertainties in interstellar reddening corrections .",
    "moreover , the region around the main - sequence turnoff ( to ) presents a cuspy shape in this diagram ( see fig .  2 in grundahl et al .",
    "1998 ) , and therefore its identification is more robust than in the typical johnson - cousins bands . in the latter photometric system",
    "the region around the to presents a steep slope ( rosenberg et al .",
    "_ iii _ ) the ( @xmath22 , ) color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) provides the opportunity to identify a _ jump _ among hot horizontal branch stars at @xmath23 k caused by radiative levitation of metals ( grundahl et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "_ iv _ ) detailed empirical investigations characterized the system not only for @xmath24 type dwarfs ( crawford 1975 , 1979 ; nissen 1988 ; olsen 1988 ; schuster & nissen 1989 , hereinafter sn89 ; nordstrom et al .",
    "2004 ) , but also for @xmath25 type giants ( bond 1980 ; richtler 1989 ; twarog & anthony - twarog 1991 ; grebel & richtler 1992 ; anthony - twarog & twarog 1994 , hereinafter att94 ; h00 ) .",
    "_ v _ ) the use of the @xmath0 versus color plane can also be safely adopted to distinguish cluster and field stars ( att00 ; rey et al .",
    "_ vi _ ) accurate photometry can also be adopted to constrain the ensemble properties of stellar populations in complex stellar systems like the galactic bulge ( feltzing & gilmore 2000 ) and disk ( haywood 2001 ) .",
    "_ vii _ ) photometry has been recently adopted to investigate the membership and the metallicity distribution of red giant ( rg ) stars in the local group dwarf spheroidal galaxy draco ( faria et al .",
    "moreover , it has also been adopted to remove the degeneracy between age and metallicity in other stellar systems hosting simple stellar populations ( gcs , elliptical galaxies ) , to investigate age and metallicity distributions of dwarf elliptical galaxies in the coma and fornax galaxy clusters ( rakos & schombert 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the system presents two substantial drawbacks . _",
    "i _ ) the @xmath22 and @xmath26 bands have short effective wavelengths , namely @xmath27 and @xmath28 . as a consequence the ability to perform accurate photometry with current ccd detectors is hampered by their reduced sensitivity in this wavelength region .",
    "ii _ ) the intrinsic accuracy of the stellar parameters , estimated using indices , strongly depends on the accuracy of the absolute zero - point calibrations .",
    "this typically means an accuracy better than 0.03 mag .",
    "this limit could be easily accomplished in the era of photoelectric photometry , but it is not trivial at all in the modern age of ccds .",
    "the use of photometry was also hampered by the lack of accurate bolometric corrections ( bcs ) and color - temperature relations ( ctrs ) based on recent and homogeneous sets of atmosphere models .",
    "this gap was partially filled by the new semi - empirical set of bcs and ctrs provided by clem et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereinafter cvgb04 ) and by the new theoretical calibration of the @xmath20 index provided by castelli & kurucz ( 2006 , hereinafter ck06 ) .",
    "moreover and even more importantly , current empirical calibrations of metallicity indices are based either on field stars ( att94 ) or on a mix of cluster and field stars ( h00 ) .",
    "however , empirical spectroscopic evidence suggests that field and cluster stars present different heavy element abundance patterns ( gratton , sneden & carretta 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , the occurrence of cn and/or ch rich stars in ggcs ( anthony - twarog , twarog , & craig 1995 ; grundahl , stetson , & andersen 2002 ) along the rg ( hr00 ) , the subgiant branch , and the main sequence ( stanford et al .  2004 ; kayser et al .",
    "2006 ) also suggests the opportunity for an independent calibration of the metallicity index based only on cluster stars as originally suggested by richtler ( 1989 ) .    to fill this gap we plan to provide new empirical , semi - empirical , and theoretical calibrations of the @xmath0 metallicity index using cluster stars , and new sets of semi - empirical and theoretical transformations",
    "this is the first paper of a series devoted to photometry of ggcs .",
    "the structure of the current paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we discuss in detail the photometric catalogs we adopted for the new empirical calibration and for validating current metallicity - index  color ( mic ) relations .",
    "section 3 deals with the selection criteria adopted to select the gcs for the calibration together with the optical - nir two - color planes and the proper - motion selection adopted to identify candidate field and cluster rg stars . in ",
    "4 we discuss the approach adopted to calibrate the metallicity index , while in  5 we present the different tests we performed to validate the current empirical calibrations and the comparison between photometric estimates and spectroscopic measurements of iron abundances .",
    "section 6 deals with the calibration of both semi - empirical and theoretical mic relations . in this section",
    "we also discuss the validation of the new relations and the comparison with spectroscopic abundances and with other calibrations of the mic relations available in the literature .",
    "we summarize the results and briefly discuss further improvements and applications of the new mic relations in  7 .",
    "the photometric catalogs of globular clusters adopted in this investigation were collected with the 2.56 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) on la palma and with the 1.54 m danish telescope on la silla ( eso ) , using the @xmath29 filter sets available there ( see table  1 for a log of the observations ) .",
    "data secured with the not were collected during three observing runs in 1995 , 1997 , and in 1998 .",
    "stars from the lists of olsen ( 1983 , 1984 ) and sn88 were observed on two nights in 1995 and four nights in 1998 under photometric conditions , to derive the transformation between the instrumental magnitudes and the standard system .",
    "the data for m13 have already been described in grundahl et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , while those for m92 ( ngc  6341 ) were collected with a thinned ar coated @xmath30 pixel ccd camera on the hirac instrument , with 011 per pixel , thus covering a sky area of approximately @xmath31 arcmin@xmath32 .",
    "most of the observations were collected using tip / tilt correction , and the seeing fwhm of the entire set of images ranges from @xmath33045 to @xmath3310 .",
    "there was no significant variation of the point spread function ( psf ) over the field of view .",
    "we observed two overlapping fields in m92 , with one field on the cluster center to ensure a large sample of hb and red - giant branch ( rgb ) stars .",
    "data for m71 were collected between june 26 and july 2 , 1995 , and we observed a field 2@xmath34 north of the cluster center ( for more details see grundahl et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the images from the 1.54 m danish telescope were acquired during two observing runs in may and in october 1997 .",
    "for both runs we used the danish faint object spectrograph and camera ( dfosc ) equipped with a thinned , ar coated 2048 @xmath35 2048 pixel ccd camera .",
    "the field of view covered by these data is approximately 11 arcmin across . during the october observing run data",
    "were collected for ngc@xmath1104 , ngc@xmath1288 , ngc@xmath11851 , ngc@xmath1362 , and ngc@xmath16752 , and during the run in may for ngc@xmath16397 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the selected clusters were observed on several photometric nights , and approximately 150 different standard stars from the list collected by olsen ( 1983 , 1984 ) and by sn88 were also observed .",
    "these images were secured during seeing conditions ranging from 13 to 22 .",
    "flat fields were obtained on each night during evening and morning twilight .",
    "photometry for the defocused standard stars was derived from large - aperture photometry .",
    "the photometry of the cluster and standard frames was performed with daophot@xmath1iv / allframe and daogrow ( stetson 1987 , 1991 , 1994 ) .",
    "based on the frame  to  frame scatter for the bright stars in the clusters with calibrated photometry we estimate that the errors in the photometric zero points are below 0.02  mag for the observations from not , and less than 0.03  mag for the data from the 1.54 m danish telescope .",

    "( 1999 ) and grundahl , stetson & andersen ( 2002 ) .",
    "the final calibrated cluster catalogs include @xmath33 15,00030,000 stars .",
    "the catalogs adopted in this investigation can be retrieved from the following url : http://www.mporzio.astro.it/spress/stroemgren.php .",
    "in order to calibrate the metallicity index @xmath0 we selected four globular clusters , namely m92 , m13 , ngc@xmath11851 , ngc@xmath1104 , that cover a broad range in metallicity ( @xmath36 ) , are marginally affected by reddening ( @xmath3 ) , and for which accurate photometry is available to well below the turnoff region ( grundahl et al .  1998 ; grundahl et al .  1999 ,",
    "grundahl , stetson & andersen 2002 ) .",
    "we performed several tests by including among the calibrating clusters other gcs that also have low reddening values ( ngc@xmath1288 , ngc@xmath1362 , ngc@xmath16752 ) , but the intrinsic accuracy of the calibration did not improve , since their iron abundances are very similar either to m13 or to ngc@xmath11851 .",
    "the metallicities and the reddening values for these clusters are listed in table  2 .",
    "empirical evidence suggests that the @xmath0 versus color relation of rg stars presents a linear trend and a good sensitivity to iron abundance ( bond 1980 ; richtler 1989 ; twarog & anthony - twarog 1991 ; grebel & richtler 1992 ; att94 ; h00 ) .",
    "therefore , we selected cluster stars from the tip to the base of the rgb with a photometric accuracy @xmath37 0.03 mag and @xmath38 0.02 mag for each cluster in our sample .",
    "however , in order to avoid subtle systematic uncertainties in the empirical calibrations , actual cluster rg stars need to be distinguished from contaminating field stars . to accomplish this goal we decided to use optical - nir color ",
    "color planes to split cluster from field stars . in particular , we cross - identified stars in common with our catalogs and the near - infrared ( nir ) two micron",
    "all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalog ( skrutskie et al .",
    "moreover , we also re - identified a subsample of our optical catalog in the second us naval observatory ccd astrograph proper motion catalog ( ucac2 , zacharias et al .",
    "2004 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the cross identification was performed following these steps : _ i _ ) iraf s immatch package was used to establish a preliminary spatial transformation from the catalog s ccd coordinates to the reference catalog s equatorial ( j2000.0 ) system for a subsample of matched stars ; _ ii _ ) the full catalog was transformed onto and matched with the reference catalog , on the basis of radial distance and initially also on apparent stellar brightness ; _ iii _ ) the previous steps were reiterated 23 times until the transformation permitted a near - complete matching , and then , _ iv _ ) the final , matched sample of common stars was obtained by rejecting entries separated by more than , typically , 0813 .    in certain cases",
    "the stellar magnitudes were used also to reject mismatches while taking into account possible ranges of color differences in the available bands .",
    "note that our photometry mostly covers relatively small and off - center fields of the analyzed clusters .",
    "the stated ucac2 proper - motion errors are about 13 mas yr@xmath39 for stars to 12th magnitude and 47 mas yr@xmath39 for fainter stars to 16th magnitude , while the precision of the positions is 1570 mas , depending on magnitude , with estimated systematic errors of 10 mas or below .",
    "the 2mass catalog has limiting magnitudes for the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42bands of about 15.8 , 15.1 , and 14.3 mag , respectively , while the astrometric accuracy is of the order of 100 mas .",
    "[ fig1 ]     finally , we selected for each cluster only the rg stars with at least three nir measurements ( @xmath43 ) and all four magnitudes .",

    "1 shows three isochrones at fixed cluster age ( @xmath45 gyr ) and different chemical compositions in this plane .",
    "the evolutionary models and the atmosphere models adopted to transform theoretical predictions into the observational plane have been constructed adopting a scaled - solar abundance mixture .",
    "the evolutionary phases plotted in this figure range from the base ( hot end ) to the tip ( cool end ) of the rgb .",
    "the systematic drift , at fixed @xmath46 , toward redder colors when moving from metal - poor to metal - rich structures is clear .",
    "it is noteworthy that a difference of 1,200 k ( z=0.0001 ) and of 2,000 k ( z=0.02 ) between the base and the tip of the rgb are covered by @xmath33 three and by more than seven magnitudes , respectively .",

    "1 also shows the central h - burning phases up to the turnoff point for the same metal abundances and cluster ages ( solid colored lines ) .",
    "a partial degeneracy between metal - poor and metal - intermediate dwarfs and rg stars takes place only in the hot corner of this color - color plane , while at solar chemical composition it covers a broader color range .",
    "however , typical halo and thin disk field populations possess iron abundances systematically more metal - poor than the solar value ( castellani et al .",
    "we did not use the @xmath47-band photometry because it is less accurate in the faint magnitude limit when compared with @xmath40- and @xmath41-band magnitudes . a similar procedure but based on johnson - cousins optical magnitudes and nir magnitudes was adopted by castellani et al .",

    "<S> we present a new calibration of the stroemgren metallicity index @xmath0 using red giant ( rg ) stars in a sample of galactic globular clusters ( ggcs : m92 , m13 , ngc@xmath11851 , 47  tuc ) that cover a broad range in metallicity ( @xmath2 ) , are marginally affected by reddening uncertainties ( @xmath3 ) and for which accurate @xmath4 stroemgren photometry is available to well below the turnoff region . the main difference between the new empirical metallicity  index  color ( mic ) relations and similar relations available in the literature </S>",
    "<S> is that we have adopted the  and  colors instead of the  color . </S>",
    "<S> these colors present a stronger sensitivity to effective temperature , and the mic relations show a linear and well - defined slope . the net difference between photometric estimates and spectroscopic measurements , for rg stars in five ggcs : m71 , ngc@xmath1288 , ngc@xmath1362 , ngc@xmath16397 , ngc@xmath16752 , is @xmath5 dex with @xmath6 = 0.11 dex . </S>",
    "<S> we also apply the new mic relations to a sample of field stars for which spectroscopic metallicity ( @xmath7 ) , accurate photometry , and reddening estimates ( anthony - twarog & twarog 1994 , 1998 ) are all available . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the difference between photometric estimates and spectroscopic measurements is on average @xmath8 dex , with @xmath9 dex . </S>",
    "<S> + we also provide two independent sets of mic relations based on evolutionary models that have been transformed into the observational plane by adopting either semi - empirical or theoretical color - temperature relations ( ctrs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the semi - empirical @xmath10enhanced mic relations to the nine gcs and find that the difference between photometric estimates and spectroscopic measurements is @xmath5 dex , with @xmath11 dex . </S>",
    "<S> a similar agreement is also found for the sample of field stars , and indeed the difference is @xmath12 dex , with @xmath13 dex . </S>",
