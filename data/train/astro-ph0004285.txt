    "optical microlensing has unambiguously been detected both in our own galaxy ( e.g. the eros , macho and ogle collaborations ; see these proceedings ) , as well as in external galaxies ( e.g. q2237 + 0305 ; irwin et al .",
    "however , no convincing detections of microlensing in other wavebands have been claimed thus far . in our galaxy",
    "this is mostly due to the very low surface number density of bright sources , other than stars , that are compact enough ( i.e. @xmath2few mas ) to be significantly microlensed . for cosmological microlensing",
    "there are similar arguments . because the angular einstein radius of a point - mass scales approximately as @xmath3@xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance to the lens , the lensed source must be @xmath2few@xmath1as in angular size to by microlensed by compact stellar - mass lenses at cosmological distances ( few gpc ) .",
    "it was thought until recently that only the optical to @xmath6-ray emitting regions of quasars and agns had these extremely small angular scales and would still be observable over cosmological distances .    in this proceeding",
    "we will show , however , that ` radio - microlensing ' has most likely been detected in the class gravitational lens b1600 + 434 ( jackson et al .",
    "1995 ) and that it promises to be a new and exciting technique for the study of massive compact objects in galaxies at intermediate redshifts .",
    "the jvas / class gravitational - lens survey ( e.g. browne et al . 1997 ) has discovered at least 17 radio - bright gravitational lens systems .",
    "all systems were selected to have a flat spectrum ( @xmath7@xmath80.5 with @xmath9@xmath3@xmath10 ) between 5 and 1.4ghz .",
    "this ensures that most of these sources are dominated by a compact radio - bright core .",
    "these sources are often variable on short time scales and in many cases show superluminal motion ( e.g. vermeulen & cohen 1994 ) .",
    "strong variability seems to imply that these radio sources are very compact . based on a simple light - travel - time argument",
    ", one expects a source at a cosmological distance ( few gpc ) to have an angular scale of only a few @xmath1as if it varies significantly on a time scale of say one month .",
    "however , superluminal motion with a high doppler - boosting factor ( @xmath11 ) complicates this argument , because the intrinsic variability time scale is reduced by a factor @xmath12 , whereas the intrinsic angular scale of the source is reduced by only @xmath13 ( e.g. lhteenmki , valtaoja & wiik 1999 ) . based on variability arguments , the angular size of the source",
    "could therefore be severely underestimated if @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , based on rayleigh  jean s law and a typical surface brightness temperature of @xmath15k ( e.g. lhteenmki et al .",
    "1999 ) , one expects an angular size as much as several tens of @xmath1as for those sources that have been observed in the jvas / class survey .",
    "this is much larger than the typical einstein radius of a solar - mass object .",
    "overall , it appears that microlensing of these sources is at most marginal , especially for the brighter sources ( tens of mjy ) .",
    "however , matters are not as bad as they seem ! first of all , lensed sources are often magnified by the lensing potential .",
    "their intrinsic flux - density is therefore less than the observed flux - density and , because surface brightness ( temperature ) is conserved in lensing , also their intrinsic angular source size is smaller .",
    "second , flat - spectrum sources at high redshifts often exhibit jet - structures with superluminal motion ( e.g. vermeulen & cohen 1994 ) .",
    "if these jets contain many distinct ` bullets ' or shock - fronts , their angular sizes can be very small , especially if they are significantly doppler - boosted ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we expect this to be the case near the core of these flat - spectrum sources , although components further along the jet might grow in size and have lower velocities .",
    "hence , even though the integrated flux - density of the source might be large , suggesting a large angular size , in reality the likely presence of compact substructure with high doppler - boostings makes this argument significantly weaker .",
    "the expected angular size of these flat - spectrum subcomponents is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the surface brightness temperature of the component in units of @xmath18k , @xmath1 is the magnification by the lens and @xmath19 is the source redshift . for subcomponent flux - densities ( @xmath20 ) of a few mjy , an angular size of a few @xmath1as",
    "can be expected .",
    "this is small enough to be appreciably microlensed !    below",
    "we will illustrate this by the class gravitational lens system b1600 + 434 , in which believe to have detected radio - microlensing of precisely this type of @xmath1as - scale jet - components ( koopmans & de bruyn 2000 ; kdb00 hereafter ) .",
    "the class gravitational lens b1600 + 434 consists of two compact radio components separated by 1.4 arcsec ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the lens galaxy is an edge - on spiral at a redshift of 0.41 , whereas the source has a redshift of 1.59 ( koopmans , de bruyn & jackson 1998 ) .",
    "image a passes predominantly through the dark - matter halo of the lens galaxy ( @xmath06kpc above the plane of the galaxy ) , whereas image b passes through its stellar component ( i.e. disk / bulge ) .",
    "the extended optical emission around image a is thought to be associated with its host galaxy at @xmath21=1.59 . both radio components are compact ( @xmath21mas ) and have a flat radio spectrum .",
    "the source is highly variable at frequencies between 1.4 and 8.5ghz ( koopmans et al .",
    "1998 ) .    to determine the time delay between the lensed images",
    ", we monitored b1600 + 434 with the vla in a- and b - arrays at 8.5ghz , during a period of about 8 months in 1998 ( koopmans et al . 2000 ) . from these light curves",
    "we determined a time delay of 47@xmath22 days ( 68% ) , using the minimum - dispersion method from pelt et al .",
    "the prh method ( press , rybicki & hewitt 1992 ) gives the same time delay within the error range . shifting the light curve of image b back in time over this time - delay and subsequently subtracting it from the light curve of image a , taking the proper flux - density ratio in to account , results in the difference light curve shown in fig.2",
    ". the rms variability of the difference light curve ( 2.8% ) is significantly larger than the expected rms variability due to noise only ( 1.1% ) .",
    "the difference light curve is consistent with the presence of non - intrinsic variability ( i.e. ` external ' variability ) at the 14.6@xmath23 confidence level ( kdb00 ) . because the time delay was determined using a minimum - dispersion method , time delays other than 47 days would yield an even larger rms variability in the difference light curve",
    "what can be the origin of the presence of ` external ' variability in the image light curves ?",
    "there are several plausible causes :    * scintillation by the galactic ionized interstellar medium .",
    "* microlensing of the background source by massive compact objects in the lens galaxy .    before proceeding , however ,",
    "let us first summarize the results on b1600 + 434 from our vla & wsrt monitoring data ( until late 1999 ) , that might be relevant in uncovering the true nature of the observed external variability ( see kdb00 ) :    1 .   the short - term rms variability ( i.e. the 1@xmath24order modulation index ) of the lensed images a and b are 2.8% and 1.6% respectively .",
    "the difference light curve has an rms variability of 2.8% .",
    "3 .   the vla 8.5-ghz image light curves , as well as the difference light curve , seem to show long - term ( @xmath251d ) variability , next to some faster variability .",
    "the precise time scales are hard to determine , because of the average light - curve sampling rate of once per 3.3 days .",
    "several 5-ghz wsrt 12-h integrated flux - density lightcurves of b1600 + 434 ( june - july 1999 ) , with a sampling rate of once every 5 min , show no evidence for variability @xmath262% on time scales less than 12 hours .",
    "multi - frequency monitoring with the wsrt shows a decrease in the short - term rms variability from 5 to 1.4ghz by a factor of @xmath03 .    can this considerable body of multi - frequency data be explained in terms of galactic scintillation ( section 4.1 ) or radio - microlensing ( section 4.2 ) ?      from ` standard ' scintillation theory ( e.g. narayan 1992 ) , we expect a strong anti - correlation between the time - scale of variability and its amplitude ( i.e. rms variability ) . according to the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model for the galactic ionized medium , b1600 + 434 should be in the weak - scattering regime and have a variability time scale of at most @xmath01 day for an observed rms variability of 1.62.8% .",
    "however , the wsrt data show no evidence for this short - term variability ( point 4 ) . in fact",
    "a number of flux - density variations appear to have relatively long time scales ( several weeks ; see point 3 and also section 5 ) .",
    "these time scales would normally correspond to an rms variability that is well below the noise level ( @xmath271% ) .",
    "hence , the longer variability time scales are _ not _ compatible with the observed amplitude of variability in the lensed images ( kdb00 ) .    beside this , the images are separated by only 1.4 arcsec but show a factor @xmath01.75 difference in their rms variabilities ( point 1 ) .",
    "this either results from a difference of a factor @xmath03.1 in their galactic scattering measures , or a 90@xmath1as scatter - broadening of image b in the lens galaxy at @xmath28@xmath2912ghz ( kdb00 ) .",
    "this requires a scattering measure @xmath01  kp@xmath30 in the lens galaxy , which is very large compared to typical lines - of - sight through our galaxy .",
    "scatter - broadening at a lower level can not be excluded , however .    finally , in the case of scintillation the observed rms variability should increase towards longer wavelenghts if the source is extended ( i.e. larger than the scattering disk ) . in the case of b1600 + 434 , however , we find that the rms variability decrease by almost a factor @xmath03 between 5 and 1.4ghz ( kdb00 ; point 5 )",
    ". one might argue that the source contains a compact component that scintillates _ and _ a more extended component that does not vary .",
    "the compact component would show less variability at 1.4ghz than at 5ghz , because it would be in the strong - scattering regime .",
    "however , the time - scale of variability at 5ghz for this component would remain only a few hours , whereas the 12-h wsrt light curves show no evidence for this ( point 4 ) .",
    "overall , we conclude that the observational evidence does not seem to favor scintillation as the explanation of the observed external variability in b1600 + 434 ( kdb00 ) . to save this hypothesis a considerable rethinking of the properties of the galactic ionised medium",
    "is required , at least in the direction of b1600 + 434 .",
    "how about radio - microlensing ? there are different ` ingredients ' that play a role :    * * source structure : * we assume that the source consist of a stationary core with a jet structure .",
    "this jet contains ( several ) condensations , either physical ` bullets ' or shock - fronts .",
    "these jet - components move with near- or super - luminal motion and are compact ( @xmath1as scale ) , especially near the core .",
    "components further along the jet might grow in size . * * compact objects in the lens galaxy : * the lens galaxy consists ( partly ) of massive compact objects .",
    "these objects create a magnification pattern on the source - plane , if they constitute a considerable fraction of the lens - galaxy mass inside a radius of 0.51 arcsec ,    when these two ` ingredients ' are combined , one will have jet - components that move over the magnfication pattern , being continuously magnified and/or demagnified , resulting in variability in the integrated flux density of the lensed images .",
    "the time - scale for these jet - component to cross the einstein diameter of a point - mass is @xmath31 where @xmath19 is the source redshift , @xmath32 is the apparent jet - component velocity in units of @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the lens mass , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the angular diameter distances between lens - source , observer - source and observer lens , respectively .",
    "more complex microlensing simulations show similar time - scales of the order of weeks to months for typical jet velocities of a few time @xmath33 and compact - object masses of @xmath01m@xmath38 .",
    "the longer observed variability time - scales for b1600 + 434 are therefore consistent with the radio - microlensing hypothesis ( kdb00 ) .",
    "the difference in rms variability between the lensed images can be explained either by a difference in the compact - object mass function in their respective lines - of - sight and/or by moderate scatter - broadening ( @xmath26few@xmath1as ) of the image passing through the disk / bulge .",
    "if for example the average mass of compact objects in the disk / bulge is much lower than that for the halo line - of - sight , the resulting magnification pattern will show a more dense caustic network .",
    "this reduces the expected rms variability for a given angular source size ( e.g. kdb00 ) .    the strongest argument in favor of microlensing , however , is the frequency dependence of the observed rms variability . using the constraints on the jet - structure that we derived from the 8.5-ghz vla observations in 1998 , we predict a decrease in modulation index from 5 to 1.4ghz by a factor",
    "@xmath03 , if we assume that the jet - components are synchrotron self - absorbed ( i.e. grow linearly with wavelength ) .",
    "this decrease has indeed been observed in the independent wsrt observations from 1998/1999 ( section 4 ; kdb00 ) .",
    "during the 1999/2000 vla a- and b - array configurations we have been monitoring b1600 + 434 at 8.5 , 5 and 1.4ghz ( koopmans et al . in prep ) .",
    "some very preliminary results at 5ghz are shown in fig.3 .",
    "this data show several strong ` events ' ( 1030% ) at both 5 and 8.5ghz , whereas they are absent in the 1.4-ghz light curve .",
    "what is their origin ?",
    "all distinct events in image a do not re - occur in image b ( after the time - delay of @xmath047 days ) and are therefore _ not _ intrinsic source variability .",
    "can the strongest feature ( around day 80 ) be an ` extreme scattering event ' ( ese ; fiedler et al .",
    "plasma clouds in our galaxy move with typically @xmath030 km / s .",
    "event durations of several weeks then imply an angular size for these clouds of @xmath01mas , if they are located at @xmath00.5kpc distance from us , thereby covering the entire source .",
    "an event of @xmath030% at 5ghz would then be detectable at 1.4ghz as well , whereas no evidence for this is seen in the vla 1.4-ghz light curves .",
    "moreover , these very rare ese s are not expect to occur several times in the same light curve of image a within a time span of only @xmath0150 days .",
    "similarly , also scintillation does not show this extreme behavior in amplitude over time scales of several weeks ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "rather , we think that this event is caused by a @xmath1as - scale jet - component in the lensed source , which has recently been ejected from the core .",
    "this component subsequently moves over a single caustic in the magnification pattern that is created by compact objects in the line - of - sight towards lensed image a , causing observable variability in the integrated flux - density of the lensed image .",
    "the class gravitational lens b1600 + 434 shows strong ` external ' variability in the vla 5 and 8.5-ghz light curves of lensed image a , which passes predominantly through the halo of the lens galaxy .",
    "neither galactic scintillation nor extreme scattering events ( ese ) can satisfactorily explain all the observations .",
    "only ` radio microlensing ' can explain the observed variability time - scales and amplitudes , as well as its frequency dependence , without invoking extreme assumptions .",
    "it also offers a natural explanation for the strong ( @xmath030% ) event that we more recently observed , as being a ` radio - microlensing caustic crossing ' .",
    "based on the 1998 vla and 1998/9 wsrt data , we already attempted to place constraints on the mass - function of compact objects in the lens - galaxy halo , finding a lower limit of @xmath260.5m@xmath38 ( kdb00 ) .",
    "however , these constraints are still weak and depend strongly on assumptions about scatter - broadening in image b. the way foreward is to use _ only _ the lightcurve of image a to put constraints on the mass function in its line - of - sight . with the detection of distinct radio - microlensing events , this task has become a realistic possibility .",
    "we have started to work on this ( koopmans et al . in prep ) and hopefully we will soon be able to place significantly better constraints on the mass function of compact objects in the lens - galaxy halo , bringing cosmological radio - microlensing up to galactic standards !",
    "we thank roger blandford , konrad kuijken , jean - pierre marquart , penny sackett and jane dennett - thorpe for critical discussions during the course of this work .",
    "we also thank the participants of the ` microlensing 2000 ' conference for positive feedback .",
