    "it s no great stretch to assume that all cool stars ( later than mid - f spectral type ) have chromospheres and , likely , winds as well . these are regions above the photosphere too hot to be heated radiatively ; rather , they must be heated by magnetic processes or by shocks .",
    "most analyses such stars chromospheres and winds are based on interpreting the strengths and shapes of emission lines in their spectra .",
    "the sun is the only one for which we can actually map out the chromosphere in any appreciable spatial detail .",
    "all the others are unresolved , which limits us to interpreting global properties of the emitting gas in terms of models without any real spatial information ( zero - dimensional ) .",

    "many of lines involved fall in the uv because of the temperatures and densities obtaining in these chromospheres , so our knowledge of cool giants chromospheres necessarily has developed through observations from _ iue _ , the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ satellite ( e.g. , judge 1988 ) and more recently _ hst _ , the _ hubble space telescope _",

    ". other observations of these chromospheres involve measuring radio thermal emission from their winds ( drake & linsky 1986 ; harper et al .",

    "an alternative , complementary approach to mapping the properties of chromospheres solely by interpreting observations of the emission lines of single stars is to use the @xmath3  aurigae binaries ( wright 1959 , 1970 ; wilson & abt 1954 ) to probe their chromospheres and winds in greater spatial detail ( legitimately at least one - dimensionally ) .",
    "these systems consist of a cool supergiant paired with a b dwarf , the prototype system @xmath3  aur consisting of k4  ib and b5  v components .",

    "there is a commonly held belief , even prejudice , that the chromospheres / winds of single stars are different than the those of binary components in that winds of single stars accelerate much more rapidly than winds of the binaries and reach lower terminal velocities .",
    "this paper assesses whether the observations of single stars might be consistent with the slower acceleration of binary components .",
    "i shall begin with a review of the picture developed for single stars through traditional analyses (   2 ) , then discuss the model for cool supergiants developed from observations of the @xmath3  aur binary 31  cyg (   3 ) , testing it through comparisons with emission lines and radio continuum emission .",
    "i then use this model to interpret the measurements for single stars (   4 ) and give some speculations about wind acceleration (   5 ) .",

    "the most perplexing result of such kinematic analyses is the existence of broad wings and a @xmath104  redshift of the 2 ] lines in most of these stars .",
    "these may well not be formed under similar conditions as most other weak lines , and , in fact , those other lines ( such as fluorescent 1  and weak lines of 2  and 2 ] ) do not show these phenomena .",

    "1999 ; mcmurray & jordan 2000 ) .",
    "these molecular species must be present in some part of the chromosphere , but the eclipses of @xmath3  aur binaries generally do not detect them , probably because there is plenty of cold dense gas in the inner parts of the chromosphere to hide their absorptions in the competing atomic features .",
    "mcmurray et al .  have argued that the strengths of fluorescent h@xmath17 and co lines , which they could not reproduce with their non - dimensional semi - empirical model of @xmath2  tau , require a multi - component atmosphere , possibly with shocks deep in the atmosphere to generate enough ly@xmath2 flux there to excite these molecules radiatively .",

    "such analyses give winds accelerating much faster than those of the @xmath3  aur binaries or , for that matter , of @xmath19 stars as deduced from radio observations ( harper et al .",
    "2001 , 2005 ; carpenter et al .",
    "in fact , the analysis of thermal radio emission has become a fruitful technique for deducing the wind structure of single windy giants ( e.g. , drake & linsky 1986 ; harper et al .",
    "although optical spectra provided many insights into the nature of the extended atmospheres of the cool supergiant components of @xmath3  aur systems , the field was essentially dormant from the mid 1950 s until _ iue _ revitalized it with panchromatic uv spectra .",
    "i have discussed the results of such studies in a review at the cool stars 9 meeting ( eaton 1996 ) .",
    "i shall summarize them here as follows : first , the new uv observations recorded absorptions from most of the important species expected to exist in chromospheres and winds of cool giant stars . in contrast , optical spectra give very few of these species .",
    "furthermore these uv absorptions are often intrinsically strong lines that can be detected at great heights above the stellar surface , giving us the ability to probe winds to much greater height .",
    "for the first time we could use the wings of ly@xmath2 to measure hydrogen column densities directly for many lines of sight through the wind / chromosphere .",
    "the many lines of 2 , likewise , gave measurements of excitation temperature ( t@xmath20 @xmath10 5,00012,500 k ) and kinematics of the wind throughout much of the wind and upper chromosphere .",
    "some of the results from _ iue _ are conventional while others are surprising .",
    "strengths and shapes of lines from different ionization stages of metals , most importantly iron , confirm the expectation that the metals are mostly _ singly - ionized _ throughout the chromospheres and winds of these stars . likewise",
    ", the detection of the wings of ly@xmath2 at height in chromospheres and rough agreement of the mass column densities derived with those from 2 , means that _ h is primarily neutral _ throughout those parts of the wind we can sample .",
    "this contradicts the predictions of semi - empirical models in which h becomes completely ionized over the first several scale heights of the chromosphere , giving roughly a constant electron density in the line - emitting regions in spite of a marked decrease of total density ( judge 1990 , p.  290 ; ",
    "3.2 below ) .",
    "this obsevation that h remains neutral thus places limits on permitted kinetic temperatures and local electron densities in the gas .",
    "furthermore , wind models for 31  cyg give us some direct insight into the turbulence in chromospheres .",
    "single - component models of the gas with no expansion effects , i.e. , the sort of analyses used by wilson & abt , find doppler widths of the order of 20 , decidedly supersonic for gas with kinetic temperatures below 10,000  k. _ iue _ observations show that at least some of this spread is caused by the differential expansion of the gas along the line of sight and need not be attributed to local turbulence .",
    "in fact , the _ iue _ observations for 31  cyg require a turbulence @xmath9 15 .    even in the classical optical analyses ,",
    "the ionization of metals was lower than expected for a uniformly distributed gas and thereby implied clumping for the gas to achive enough electron density to maintain an observable population of trace neutral species , such as 1 .",
    "uv observations confirm this result .",
    "ionization throughout the wind is lower than expected from simplistic calculations of ionization equilibrium and implies clumping in the range 1030@xmath21 to achieve the inferred electron densities ( n@xmath22 @xmath10 0.21.5 x 10@xmath15  in the inner 150 @xmath23 of the chromosphere ) .",
    "this is a complication well beyond most semi - empirical models of chromospheres .",
    "we can use an idealized description of the measured physical properties of the gas in the chromosphere and wind of 31  cyg to test ideas about the structure of chromospheres and , ultimately , about wind mechanisms .",
    "these measurements are based on the most extensive set of observations ever obtained for a @xmath3  aur binary ( eaton & bell 1994 ) .",
    "i have chosen to concentrate on 31  cyg over the years because it has a much longer period than the other two classical @xmath3  aur binaries ( @xmath3  aur and 32  cyg ) .",
    "this gives it a greater separation and less interaction between the wind and b star , a big advantage in many analyses .",
    "the wind - scattered emission lines seen in total eclipse , for instance , are weaker than in the other two stars ( eaton 1992 ) .",
    "i am adopting the following properties for the 31  cyg system : @xmath24 = 473 pc ; @xmath25 = 197 @xmath23 , @xmath26 = 11.7 @xmath27 , @xmath28 = 7.1 @xmath27 , @xmath29 = 90 , @xmath30  = 3.0@xmath2110@xmath31  ( eaton 1993c ; eaton & bell 1994 ) .",
    "we should note that , in observing the more complicated @xmath3  aur , baade et al .",
    "( 1996 ) probably had a better case than 31  cyg for applying their wind - scattering analysis .",
    "furthermore , inasmuch as the models for 31  cyg and @xmath3  aur give essentially the same results in terms of velocity structure / extension of the wind and wind temperatures , we can be confident that the results for either of them should be readily applicable to other stars .",
    "table 2 gives the details of the empirical chromospheric / wind structure i am using to test wind models .",
    "quantities listed are ( 1 ) radius ( distance from center of the star in @xmath23 ) , ( 2 ) expansion velocity , ( 3 ) excitation temperature , ( 4 ) a temperature to drive the wind thermally , ( 5 ) a clumping factor , cf , giving the inverse of the fraction of space actually filled with matter , ( 6 ) log(@xmath32 ) , the total hydrogen density , ( 7 ) log(@xmath16 ) , the local electron density from an assumed constant ionization of h ( 3% ) and amount of clumping , ( 8) log(@xmath16 ) for the variable ionization developed in   3.2 and with the assumed clumping , but limited to 10% in the outer chromosphere , and ( 9 ) @xmath33 , a velocity derived from equipartition between mass motion and internal thermal energy of the gas ( see   5.2 ) .",
    "although the electron densities measured from photoionization balance imply significant clumping of the gas , they are rather crude and may be systematically wrong . an independent way to estimate",
    "this degree of clumping is to look at the difference between the pressures ) , but a given pressure distribution , the higher level abstraction i am specifying , implies a pressure gradient , even in the simplistic case of an isothermal wind . ] required to drive the observed wind and the gas pressures that would be available in the wind if it were not clumped .",
    "this approach works because the gas pressures ( @xmath10 @xmath34t@xmath35/@xmath36 ) would be in equilibrium with whatever pressure drives the wind .",
    "we do this by determining a temperature structure to drive the observed wind _ thermally _ , as though these stars had a coronal , i.e. , generalized parker - type , wind ( see lamers & cassinelli 1999 , chapters 4&5 ) , then comparing those temperatures to the observed temperatures , point by point , assuming the excitation temperatures we have measured approximate the electron temperature .",
    "this last assumption seems reasonable because the excitation temperatures are similar to temperatures derived for semi - empirical chromospheric models of single stars , at least in the inner parts of the wind , but we will test it in later sections . to reiterate ,",
    "if the gas is clumped , thereby bifurcating into dense clumps and an unspecified interclump medium , there must be a pressure in the interclump medium maintaining the clumping .",
    "we will assume that this is the pressure driving the wind and that it somehow breaks the wind up into microscopic clumps and maintains them .",
    "this is fundamentally different from the approach of traditional wave models in which the gas is uniform and the waves act on it continuously .",
    "the temperature structure to produce the pressure gradient required to drive the wind of 31  cyg thermally , which we have derived from a thermal - wind model , is given roughly by the equations @xmath37 and + @xmath38 where @xmath39 is thermal ( electron ) temperature for a uniformly distributed gas , r is the radius , and @xmath40=197 @xmath23  is the photospheric radius of the star .",
    "i do nt claim that this structure is a rigorous determination of the thermal - pressure profile , but that it is adequate for giving a good idea of the pressures required throughout the wind .",
    "figure 1 shows the velocity structure calculated for this adopted temperature structure of eq .  2 ;",
    "figure 2 , the amount of clumping implied .    a way to test this sort of model is to calculate the emission expected from it .",
    "i have done this in two ways , first , with a spherically symmetrical model that calculates the line strengths , line profiles , and chromospheric mass column densities specifically for 31  cyg .",
    "the second way uses a traditional plane - parallel model for @xmath3  aur i developed in 19921995 with pandora ( vernazza et al .",

    "on the other hand , gives 2 ] flux high by @xmath1050% and 2 ] high by slightly more , but the high electron density in the outer winds of these models , combined with single ionization of metals , gives much larger line broadening from differential expansion of the atmosphere .",
    "these models also have problems with electron density .",
    "if we average @xmath16  over emission of 2 ] , the values are either too high , as for the calculation for the unrealistic uniform 3% ionization of h , or somewhat low , as for the realistic ionization of h limited to 3% or even 10% .",
    "figure 3b shows the intensity profiles for the model with variable ionization .",
    "the effect of the 10% ionization in the wind is obvious , with much of the emission in the wind coming from the hot ionized outer parts .",
    "these parts , however , have electron densities much too low ( 7.7 in the log ) to give the 2 ] line ratios , at least the ones seen in single stars , and they produce 2 ] profiles much broader than observed .",
    "they are clearly inappropriate for single stars unless c becomes _ doubly ionized _ in the outer wind or unless the temperature in the outer wind is well below the measured excitation temperatures .",
    "a further test of these spherical models comes from the radio continuum observations of drake & linsky ( 1986 ) and drake et al .",

    "if we let the outer wind become mostly ionized , we can at least approach the flux level observed .",

    "is this level of ionization reasonable ?",
    "it seems consistent with observations of @xmath3  aur stars , especially 31  cyg , but the evidence for single stars is ambiguous .",
    "such high ionization should reveal itself through absorptions of _ doubly _ ionized species in spectra of @xmath3  aur binaries and possibly through emission lines from these species in both the binaries and single supergiants . the broadening of these lines would be a measurement of the terminal velocity and turbulence of the outer wind . let us look at the observations of these species in some actual stars .",

    "in addition , strong emission lines of higher ionization are seen in eclipse in all three classical @xmath3  aur binaries .",
    "multiplets 3  uv1 and 3  uv34 in 31  cyg have p - cyg profiles ( bauer & stencel 1989 , fig .  3 ) and",
    "are so strong they must be formed by scattering of light from the b star in the wind .",
    "the line widths at the bases of their profiles are roughly 170 , about what one would expect for a wind at terminal velocity .",
    "eaton & bell found that these absorptions are formed primarily at velocities _ toward the b star _ and likely result from ionization of the outer wind by the b star , not by intrinsic radiation of the supergiant .",
    "thus a large fraction of the outer wind is ionized _ in the 31  cyg system_. since h requires less energy to ionize than the 19  ev to ionize c@xmath67 out of its metastable level , h is likely ionized , as well , in these regions of 31  cyg .",
    "single stars may have lower ionization in their outer winds than the binaries with similar mass - loss rates , although there is evidence in p - cyg profiles of wind lines that some of the metals are doubly ionized in many of them ( see  4.2 below ) .",
    "carpenter et al .",

    "the problem with wind formation is that the computed line profiles are wrong .",
    "the calculated profiles are essentially square , having a central dip reflecting the absence of gas at low expansion velocities , while the observed profiles , although somewhat noisy , seem to have a central peak as though formed at least partly in turbulent gas at low expansion velocity . therefore the _ emission",
    "_ lines of single stars unfortunately tell us nothing about the ionization of their outer winds .      pandora is useful for exploring non - traditional models of chromospheres because it lets one specify an arbitrary distribution of turbulence to increase the scale height in hydrostatic equilibrium and to specify an arbitrary distribution of added electron density that can be used to simulate clumping .",

    "these semi - empirical models can give us some insight into how the gas might be ionized at various depths in actual chromospheres .",
    "all the models , regardless of assumptions about scale height , clumping , and temperature , predict species such as al will be singly ionized throughout the whole emitting atmosphere . for h and c , the calculated ionization increases with height .",
    "figure 5 shows this effect for h. in it , i have parameterized height with the electron temperature , since , by assumption , temperature increases monotonically with height above a temperature minimum in all such semi - empirical models .",
    "the calculations show that log(n@xmath69/n@xmath41 ) increases from a minimum of @xmath184.0 at @xmath10 2600  k , determined by ionization of the metals included in the calculation , to 0.0 ( complete ionization of h ) at @xmath10 9400  k. for c , complete ionization occurs near 5000  k in these models .",
    "the actual models have scale heights somewhat smaller than that of 31  cyg , so the level of ionization could be higher in 31  cyg .      one possible error in eaton & bell s analysis of 31  cyg is the determination of the temperature from excitation of 2 .",
    "we have assumed that the excitation temperatures measured are _ bona fide _ electron temperatures of the gas .",
    "this might be the case , in that most of these lines arise from excited metastable levels which would probably be in thermal equilibrium with the electrons , at least in the denser parts of the wind ( e.g. , judge et al .",
    "harper et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argued this point explicitly , while others deriving temperatures for @xmath3  aur binaries ( such as eaton & bell ) have implicitly assumed it .",
    "however , the excitation temperatures in the outer parts of the winds may well be greater than the thermal temperatures , since these regions are bathed in the radiation of a b star , and since the electron densities expected in these zones are lower than the critical density ( @xmath10 10@xmath70 per judge et al .",
    "1992 ) for radiative processes to become important . in the model for 31",
    "cyg , these temperatures have very little effect on the emission at any wavelength , since the densities are very low .",
    "contrariwise , all of these stars have rather high excitation temperatures in their outer chromospheres , regardless of the effective temperature of the b companion .",
    "we see this in figure 6 which gives @xmath71  as a function of tangential mass column density through the chromosphere .",
    "we see that the temperature rises to about 8500  k where the balmer lines become optically thin .",
    "this agrees roughly with theoretical calculations for supergiants .",
    "here i shall attempt to fit the rich lore of space - dimensionless analyses of line emission and absorption of single stars into the context of our knowledge of the legitimately one- to two - dimensional knowledge of @xmath3  aur binaries .",
    "we might expect the wind structure of the binaries to be essentially the same as that of single stars because the strengths of intrinsic emissions formed in the wind and chromosphere of @xmath3  aur binaries are similar to those of single stars ( schrder et al .",
    "1988 ; eaton 1992 ; harper et al .  2005 , fig .",
    "6 ) , and the h@xmath2 profiles , and their variation , seem to be the same as well ( eaton 1995 ; eaton & henry 1996 ) .",
    "most detailed analyses of cool stars chromospheres are based on semi - empirical models in which one posits a temperature rise through the outer atmosphere , calculates a density structure from hydrostatic equilibrium and radiative transfer , and then calculates the emergent spectrum from the physical conditions derived ( e.g. , kelch et al .",
    "1978 ; basri et al .  1981 ; mcmurray 1999 ) .",
    "these models are inspired by the solar chromosphere , in which there is a temperature rise from a minimum , determined by the location where non - radiative heating begins to dominate heating by photospheric radiation , to a point where the chromosphere merges with a transition region of rapidly increasing temperature , heated by downward conduction from a corona .",
    "the increase in temperature with height follows naturally from observations of the sun and from the physical consideration that temperature should rise with decreasing density to keep emissivity from falling precipitately with height per equation ( 1 ) .",
    "of course , there might be other ways to organize a chromosphere .",
    "for example , the material at different temperatures might be more intimately mixed throughout the chromosphere , as mcmurry et al .",
    "( 1999 ) contemplate to some degree .",
    "harper et al .  ( 2001 ) likewise have speculated about a truely radical reinterpretation of @xmath2  ori in which the chromospheric line emission comes entirely from hot inclusions in a generally cool neutral wind , although harper et al .",
    "( 2005 ) did not attempt to apply this radical approach to @xmath3  aur .",
    "indeed , temperature measurements for @xmath3  aur binaries , at least to first order , confirm some sort of general temperature rise with height .",
    "figure 6 shows the relation between excitation temperature and tangential mass column density through the atmospheres for four stars .",
    "the temperature rise is obvious .",
    "while this evidence does not preclude mixing some hot gas with the bulk of the warm gas throughout the chromosphere , it shows that the bulk of the gas behaves sort of like the gas in these classical semi - empirical models .",
    "another fundamental property of semi - empirical models is the density structure . in the calculated models",
    ", it usually comes from hydrostatic equilibrium between gravity and thermal motions of the emitting gas ( @xmath72 @xmath73 10,000  k ) .",
    "this is problematic in that there are obviously other sources of momentum flux in a typical chromosphere , such as the turbulence we see in profiles of emission lines , which will extend the atmosphere , changing its mass and electron density structure .",
    "furthermore , the mere existence of turbulence implies some sort of clumping of the gas , which would necessarily change the local electron densities and ionization structure .",
    "moreover , such effects would change the transfer of radiation and escape of photons from the chromosphere .",
    "a third property of many semi - empirical models is a precipitate temperature rise to coronal temperatures defining the top of the chromosphere .",
    "this is not a necessary feature , especially in the windy giants .",
    "nevertheless , mcmurry ( 1999 ) used such a rise for @xmath2  tau to fit the ly@xmath2 profile and calculate emission from highly ionized species .",
    "however , the observations of @xmath3  aur binaries do not require such a rise and may not even allow it ; the profiles of 3 ] and 3 ] seem to require formation at least partly in the inner chromosphere / wind , and the arguments of mcmurry et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) suggest there are other places to excite 4 .",
    "one of the basic tenets of our understanding of the windy giants is the idea that their terminal velocities are much lower than the surface escape velocity ( e.g. , hartmann & mcgregor 1980 ; judge 1992 ; harper 1996 ) .",
    "these terminal velocities are probably not as well known as we think they are , and they may well be _ much _ higher than generally thought , especially in the normal k giants like @xmath2  tau , as judge ( 1992 ) argued in a provocative paper about wind energetics .",
    "this is hardly a new idea ( see , e.g. , judge 1992 ; ahmad & stencel 1988 ; kuin & ahmad 1989 ) , but it is certainly worth discussing further in the context of supposed differences between single stars and binary components . for the classical @xmath3  aur binaries , we base the terminal velocity on measurements of shell lines seen at all phases ( e.g. , eaton 1993c ) .",
    "we should be suspicious of low terminal velocities since the metals in the outer parts of the winds might well be doubly ionized , as they are in calculations of harper et al .",
    "( 2005 , fig .",
    "5 ) for @xmath3  aur and   3.2 above for single stars . furthermore",
    ", the recombination time for h , given the electron densities in the outer parts of our model ( @xmath10 10@xmath74 ) , is of the order of 1100 yr .",
    "semi - empirical models for single stars also become fully ionized , at least in h , in these regions , if that actually means anything .",
    "so we really do nt know what these winds are doing in a vast volume of space before they recombine and form the shell lines .",
    "occasionally more of the velocity structure may reveal itself through abnormally dense winds , as in al  vel in 1992 ( eaton 1994 , fig .",
    "8) and in @xmath4  vel in 1990 ( mullan et al .",
    "furthermore , we should realize that the winds must be sweeping up interstellar gas in these shells ( cf .",
    "wareing , zijlstra , & obrien 2007 ) .",
    "this means that the shell velocities are , if anything , likely to be _ lower _ than the true terminal velocities .",
    "carpenter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) admit that we probably do not see much of the velocity structure in the traditional shell lines in many stars , while they contend that they have seen it all in @xmath4  vel . however , it is not clear from the line profiles of 2 , 1  uv2 , and 2  uv1 that one sees it even in that case .",
    "the velocity structure for @xmath4  vel in 1994 seems to be ionization - bound , with the maximum wind velocity sampled limited by ionization of fe@xmath67 to fe@xmath75 . in an ionization - bound wind ,",
    "the relatively high density behind the ionization front would allow somewhat weaker lines to become thick at their normal rate , while the strongest lines would quickly saturate at the velocity of the ionization front , little more than the velocity of those somewhat weaker lines , to give the sort of levelling off seen in the highest measured velocities .",
    "the edge velocities for all these strong lines in 1994 are around 50 , much greater than the supposed terminal velocity of 33 .",
    "furthermore , in 1990 the star showed absorptions to at least 80   ( mullan et al .  1998 ) , which places its terminal velocity close to what we think 31  cyg has , if the increase really did come from lower ionization in the outer wind .",
    "also , in comparing @xmath2  tau and @xmath8  dra , robinson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found terminal velocities of 30 and 67 , respectively , for stars that otherwise seem to have similar atmospheric structure .",
    "all this evidence suggests terminal velocities several times as large as they often seem , with the _ apparent _ terminal velocity dependent on just how much material is being ejected into the flow at a given time .",
    "there is another problem in interpreting these shell lines ( cf .",
    "edge velocities of @xmath4  vel ) that would lead to errors in the terminal velocity .",

    "observationally , in models for scattering in shells ( e.g. , baade et al .  1996 ) , the turbulence drops with height . theoretically , one would expect the turbulent energy to go into accelerating or heating the wind and be essentially damped out by the time the wind reaches its terminal velocity .      to investigate the nature of the turbulence",

    "the profile is still gaussian at the level of the plot , but it is shifted to the red ( 3.8 ) and broadened slightly more ( @xmath11fwhm = 1.0 ) by the variable projection of the systematic velocity into the line of sight .",
    "calculations for _ anisotropic _ turbulence all give non - gaussian profiles to some extent .",
    "some of these are shown in figure 8 .",
    "radial turbulence is especially bad in this regard ( figs .",
    "8a , c ) because the strongest emitting regions are near the stellar limb , where the turbulent motions would be mostly perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "tangential turbulence is considerably better but still decidedly non - gaussian ( figs .",

    "1991 , fig .",
    "figures 8c and 8d , however , show that _ elliptical _ anisotropic turbulence , in which one component is much larger than the other , is considerably closer to the observed gaussian shape , and the departures from the observed gaussian profiles would be somewhat reduced by convolving the calculated profiles with a gaussian point - spread function for a spectrograph , which i have not done .",
    "however , these profiles would still have overly broad wings not seen in actual stars .",
    "i chose the nature of elliptical turbulence to reflect an isotropic turbulence of 5  from perhaps thermal motion and 20  of either radial or tangential macro / micro - turbulent motions .",
    "carpenter & robinson ( 1997 ) and robinson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have cleverly fit the broadened wings of 2 ] lines with an anisotropic turbulence somehow averaged over a uniform disc , but that model is clearly inappropriate in light of the large limb effects predicted by @xmath3  aur binaries ( figure 3 ) .",
    "in fact , a calculation with our model , but limited to gas within the limb of the star , gives the awful non - gaussian profiles seen in figure 8e .",
    "given the distribution of mass in the model and the resulting limb brightening , the gaussian profiles of intrinsic lines imply a fairly _ isotropic _ turbulence .",
    "they certainly do not allow mostly _ radial _ turbulence , and they make it unlikely that the turbulence is perponderantly tangential .",
    "we have hardly any actual knowledge of the electron densities in the winds / chromospheres of any of these stars .",
    "what we do know is how dense the regions emitting the bulk of 2 ] are .",
    "everything else must somehow come from a _ model _ calculation .",
    "one of the triumphs of applying physics to cool stars is the use of 2 ] to derive precise electron densities for a large number of objects .",
    "the kinematic analysis of judge ( 1994 ) , however , undermines the importance of this result .",
    "the redshift he detects in most stars is difficult to reconcile with other aspects of uv analyses , since it requires a @xmath10 10  downdraft of all the emitting gas or something more extreme if only part of the gas is participating",
    ". it would be convenient if this redshift were the result of a systematic error in the energy levels , and this may ultimately prove to be the cause of it .",
    "the energies of the upper levels of 2 ] are quoted by moore ( 1970 ) to the nearest 0.1 cm@xmath58 , about 1 , while the wavelengths are somehow known to one more significant figure .",
    "likewise , the enhanced electron densities derived for the red side of these profiles seem to manifest themselves in only one of the line ratios , as though it might be affected by an unrecognized blend , but the dominant 2325.4  line would have to be the one affected .    however , if we accept the reality of the shift and enhancement , 2 ] must be telling us something profound about wind acceleration .",
    "c is two orders of magnitude more plentiful than al , yet lines of the two are roughly the same strength in cool giants .",
    "very little of the c , therefore , may be emitting 2 ] , and it must be produced under rather special conditions to give the observed multiplet ratios of single stars .",
    "the broad wings of 2 ] can be fit by emission in the expanding gas of the upper chromosphere / lower wind with the broadening produced by differential projection of expansion into the line of sight .",
    "however , for that approach to work , the inner regions of the chromosphere must be neutral in c , even more so than implied by ionization balance in semi - empirical models such as those of   3.2 or measured in 31  cyg .",
    "figure 8f shows such a calculation in which the gas below 5200  k emits no 2 ] .",
    "this calculation gives a reasonable flux , but it does not fit any of the other properties of 2 ] .",
    "the average electron density in the emitting gas ( 5@xmath2110@xmath77 ) is nowhere near the canonical 10@xmath12 , _ even with the clumping_. the width of the profile is somewhat more than expected for a real star ( fwhm = 35 vs.  30   for a weak line like 2 ] ) , the peak is shifted blueward by @xmath180.8 , and the wings are probably too weak relative to the core . clearly a more radical departure from the expected ionization / velocity structure is required .    looking at this more radically",
    ", we can get an idea of the conditions required _ in the 31  cyg model _ by extending our assumptions about ionization . given the velocity structure , observationally all the c would be inert below 70008000  k to weight the emission at significant expansion velocity enough to give the extended wings ( giving the same sort of effect as the anisotropic turbulence dismissed in ",
    "4.3 ) , with the bulk of emission coming from locally dense , probably rather cool regions at depth that may have peculiar velocities . again",
    ", this means that c would be _ much less ionized _ in these atmospheres than predicted by semi - empirical models , with the 2 ] emission coming from only a moderately small fraction of the gas .",
    "however , the similarity of doppler widths of 2 ] and other optically - thin lines such as 2 ] and 2 ] suggests that both are formed in gas with similar turbulence , perhaps in similar parts of the atmosphere .",
    "a possible source of the redshift of the line core is preferential excitation in the downward - facing parts of downward - moving elements in the turbulence distribution .",
    "this fraction of the gas would have the greatest relative speed with respect to the outward momentum source and might well be expected to be subjected to the most violent accelerations .",
    "figures 9 show two experiments in simulating this effect . in figure 9a the emission comes from two sources , all the gas above 8500  k emitting with the velocity structure of table 2 and 30  % of the gas at temperatures below 6000  k with a 10  downdraft .",
    "figure 9b shows the emission for a model in which the gas above 8000  k is emitting with no downdraft and only the cooler gas with log(@xmath16 ) @xmath78  8.6 is emitting with a 10  downdraft . both calculations give reasonable fluxes and electron densities averaged over the emitting gas ( 3.5 and 5.5 @xmath2110@xmath79 , respectively ) high enough to begin to approximate the observed global values .",
    "thus calculations with the most realistic chromospheric model we can muster are at least _ consistent _ with judge s suggestions about 2 ] .    this analysis has necessarily been speculative , although it is much better constrained by actual observations than any alternative analysis , e.g. , one based on a traditional semi - empirical model , could have been .",
    "i think it is fair to conclude that ( 1 ) the broad wings of 2 ] likely come from formation in the lower wind ( the broadening coming from differential expansion ) and ( 2 ) c may not be ionized in the way expected from the standard non - lte calculations of semi - empirical atmospheres but may be subject to some other source of ionization associated with the driving mechanism that picks out only part of the radial component of the turbulence distribution . in all these calculations",
    "the wings of the 2 ] line are broadened by formation in gas with significant expansion velocity projected into the line of sight .",
    "the asymmetry favoring the blue wing over the red results from having some of the redshifted gas blocked by the star .",
    "this effect is seen in actual stars , e.g. , @xmath2  tau ( carpenter et al .",
    "1991 , fig .  3 ) and",
    "@xmath8  cru ( carpenter et al .",
    "1995 , fig .  2 ) . furthermore , as a caveat",
    ", we should note ( 1 ) that c would be depleated by the first dredgeup ( e.g. , luck & lambert 1985 ) , although this effect is presumably included in my adopted c abundance , and ( 2 ) that the observations of @xmath3  aur binaries do not seem to show mostly neutral c at depth .",
    "one should also keep in mind that 2 ] may eventually destroy a basic assumption of this paper , and practically every other one written about chromospheres and winds of cool giants , that the chromosphere and wind are one continuous structure spread evenly over the face of the star .",
    "the emissions of highly ionized species such as 3 ] and 4  do not fit readily into our model for 31  cyg .",
    "the level of ionization required is incompatable with the temperatures and densities measured in the outer winds of @xmath3  aur binaries as well as with the level of ionization actually measured in these winds .",
    "however , the _ clumping _ of the gas throughout the chromosphere / wind gives us ample opportunity to incorporate more highly ionized material deep in the chromosphere and possible ways to excite it . we have assumed that the gas is confined to blobs that fill @xmath10 10% of space , surrounded essentially by a vacuum filled with an , as yet unspecified , source of pressure . the energy densities required to drive the wind through gradients of this pressure are certainly sufficiently high to allow higher ionization than the dominant levels we see in the shell lines .",
    "we may use our model for 31  cyg to test the techniques used to deduce wind structure from shell lines in single stars .",
    "the problem here is that such analyses for single stars give winds accelerating much more rapidly than those in @xmath3  aur binary components .",
    "i have used my 31  cyg model to predict what the velocities of the shell components of strong 2   lines in @xmath4  vel might be if it had the same velocity structure as 31  cyg .",
    "this is the star with the best evidence for wind acceleration in 2  self reversams , for which carpenter et al .",
    "derived a wind with @xmath80=0.9 , @xmath81=2933 , and = 3@xmath2110@xmath82 . in this simulation , i calculated the line - center radial optical depth into the atmosphere for the 2  and 2  lines measured by carpenter et al .  and determined the position and expansion velocity for @xmath83=2/3 , as though the intrinsic line emission core comes from the center of the disc .",
    "table 3 gives the results , and figure 10 displays them .",
    "these calculations assume the constraints of table 2 , with turbulence from column 9 . for the mass - loss rate of 31  cyg ,",
    "the lines become optically thick very high in the wind , absent ionization of fe@xmath84 to fe@xmath75 ( table 3 , column 5 ) , but if we reduce the mass - loss rate somewhat to 9@xmath2110@xmath82 , to partially reflect carpenter s lower value , and allow for ionization of fe to fe@xmath75 for @xmath16  @xmath73 2@xmath2110@xmath70 ( table 2 , column 8) , we get velocities in much better agreement with observed values , as seen in figure 10",
    ". unfortunately we can not apply this sort of analysis directly to the self - reversals of 2  lines in 31  cyg because the emision is formed not in the inner chromosphere , as in single stars , but by scattering light from the b star in a huge shell surrounding the binary system .",
    "these results show that we can actually reproduce the sort of observations taken to indicate a rapid acceleration of the chromosphere in a single star with a model accelerating much more slowly .",
    "the secret for doing this is the realization that the observed absorption is limited by ionization of the outer wind as discussed in   4.2 .",
    "therefore , there is really no compelling reason to believe the wind acceleration in the single windy giants is necessarily any faster than in binary components .",
    "there is evidence in occultations , as well as in the h@xmath2 profiles , that chromospheres / winds of single stars are much more extended than commonly thought .",
    "an occultation in h@xmath2 emission for the single m supergiant 119 tau at m2 ib ( white et al .  1982 ) and an image of @xmath2  ori at m2 iab ( hebden et al .",
    "1987 ) both showed h@xmath2 emission , hence significant optical depths in the lyman lines , out to at least twice the photospheric radii .",
    "also , all of these cool supergiants show asymmetric h@xmath2 profiles indicating the line core is formed in the wind at least some of the time ( mallik 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , in their model of the wind of @xmath2  ori , harper et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find a velocity / density structure giving even slower acceleration than we find in 31  cyg or they found ( harper et al .",
    "2005 ) in @xmath3  aur .",
    "the importance of @xmath3  aur binaries is that they tell us just where the bulk of the gas is in the inner few stellar radii of the stars chromospheres or winds .",
    "we can measure column densities directly and get at least a reasonable idea of how dense and hot it is throughout this critical zone where most of the energy is injected into a star s wind .",
    "furthermore , with models like those of  3.2 , we know that this gas must be emitting the intrinsic lines that we would easily see absent the b companions . the structure is therefore constrained in ways it simply can not be in any analysis of a single star .",
    "i have subjected the model for 31  cyg , and by extension models for other @xmath3  aur binaries , to tests based on various sorts of emission from their chromospheres / winds . that such a model reproduces the",
    "intrinsic 2 ] , 2 ] , and thermal radio emission to @xmath10 50% with a minimum of fiddling is an excellent test of the reality of the structure derived .",
    "furthermore , the clumping inferred for such models provides an excellent opportunity ( n.b .",
    ", this really is fiddling ) to accomodate tenuous material emitting lines of the more highly ionized species .",
    "this agreement is reassuring , inasmuch as most of the properties of the model are constrained by _",
    "observations_. the chief uncertainties involve ionization of h throughout the atmosphere , which is _ not _ measured well observationally , and ionization of h and the metals in the outer wind ( @xmath66  @xmath85 9,000k ) where many of the self reversals of strong lines would probably be formed .",
    "there are several fairly extensive investigations of the conditions required for driving winds by alfven waves that provide potentially testable predictions ( hartmann & mcgregor 1980 ; hartmann & avrett 1981 ; holzen , fl , & leer 1983 ; kuin & ahmad 1989 ) . for the most part these",
    "suffer from limitations of assuming the gas is effectively coupled to the fields ( i.e. , fully ionized ) , from not exploring the mechanisms of transfer of momentum from wave to gas realistically ( although holzer et al .",
    "did begin this process ) , and therefore from relying on somewhat nonphysical theories of how the waves are damped .",
    "there are a couple of ways of applying a wave model for driving a wind . in the more fundamental approach",
    ", one would use theories of how such waves are generated and how they interact with partially ionized media to predict the structure and properties of winds theoretically .",
    "holzer et al .",
    "( 1983 , ",
    "vi ) actually calculated some models of this sort .",
    "unfortunately , the theories required to do that are difficult to apply , and a knowledge of magnetic fields of actual stars that would support such waves is lacking .",
    "the alternative is to form a semi - empirical model for wave - driven winds , somewhat like the chromospheric models i have been discussing , and determine what the properites it must have to fit the observed structure of a wind ( viz .",
    ", mass - loss rate , terminal velocity , velocity - density structure ) .",
    "a good example of this second approach is the analyses of @xmath3  aur binaries by kuin & ahmad .",
    "their models find that damping of the wave amplitude must decrease with height to fit observed velocity profiles , as one might well expect theoretically to keep the terminal velocity consistent with observation .",
    "their models also give predictions of the level of turbulence in the chromosphere / wind by associating the lateral displacements of gas by such waves with the observed doppler widths of gas in the atmospheres of these stars . predicted",
    "doppler widths , both by kuin & ahmad and hartmann & avrett seem to be larger than the observed turbulence , both in shell absorptions in @xmath3  aur binaries and in the optically - thin emission lines of single windy giants .",
    "furthermore , since alfven waves are transverse , the  turbulence \" would be anisotropic to first order .",
    "this prediction is at odds with the observation of isotropic turbulence , although it is based on the idealization of radial magnetic fields , while the actual topology might well be more complicated ( see , e.g. , cassinelli et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "kuin & ahmad found from their semi - empirical models that the damping length for alfven waves must increase with height .",
    "the most convincing mechanism for transferring energy from the wave to the gas , i.e. , damping it , is so - called ion - neutral friction in which there is a phase lag between the wave s transferring momentum to ions and the ions subsequently transferring it to neutrals .",
    "hartmann & mcgregor discussed this mechanism , although they had no way of applying it _ a priori_. for waves with long periods , the transfer can be so rapid that the neutrals are effectively bound to the ions through elastic collisions , and there is little dissipation of wave energy or transfer of momentum .",
    "for high frequency , on the other hand , the neutrals can not respond fast enough to the passage of a wave to partake in its displacements , and the ions just stir them up and dissipate wave motion as heat . since the dissipated wave energy would go primarily into heating",
    ", this mechanism would be better for heating the chromosphere / wind than driving its outflow .",
    "most of the wave energy would be available for heating the wind but not for driving it , since the measured temperatures in these winds are much too low to drive them by thermal expansion ( cf .   3 ) .",
    "presumably the _ momentum _ of the wave would be transferred into wind motion . however , since the ratio of energy to momentum ( @xmath86 ) goes as 1/@xmath87 , with the alfven speed generally larger than either a thermal or turbulent velocity , philosophically an attractive driving mechanism would transfer its energy to heat or some other mass motion as an intermediate stage .",
    "this is why it is so hard to drive winds with radiation pressure ( @xmath86 @xmath10 1/@xmath88 ) .",
    "if all the waves had the same frequency , we would expect the momentum to be deposited in a narrow range of density , hence height , contrary to measurements of the acceleration of actual winds .",
    "the mechanism of ion - neutral friction would imply a damping length that decreased with height contrary to kuin & ahmad s result .",
    "however , it also implies that waves of different frequencies would be absorbed at different height and , therefore , that the _ spectrum _ of alfven waves would determine the velocity profile of the wind . at this point our knowledge of the photospheric motions that might be exciting alfven waves and the spectrum they would produce seems too sketchy to make any testable predictions about a wind s velocity structure .",
    "let us now take the liberty to speculate about a different way of driving the mass loss of these windy giants .",
    "we have developed here a picture of what conditions are required to drive the wind of one particularly well observed wind structure .",
    "pressures required are an order of magnitude greater than those of the implied density / temperature structure . that the microturbulence required to fit line shapes and widths",
    "seems to be rather isotropic means that we likely are not simply seeing the effects of globally organized alfven waves passing through the gas , as proposed by hartmann & mcgregor ( 1980 ) and implied by models of airapetian et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , for example",
    ". there may be another way of supporting a wind with magentic fields , namely using _",
    "chaotic fields _ emerging from the star and diffusing through the gas into space to drag the gas along with it and away from the star .",
    "some form of this idea was implicit in our previous musings about the wind structure of 31  cyg ( eaton & bell 1994 ,   6 ) , and mullan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) may have waved at it in passing .",
    "this very speculative picture is fundamentally different from the alfven model in that the magnetic field being lost can constitute a moderate amount of luminosity . in the standard alfven model , gas",
    "is driven @xmath10 radially from the star along magnetic flux lines anchored permanently in the stellar surface . here",
    ", magnetic flux would be lost at @xmath10 the same rate as the gas and constitute a significant component of the energy loss in the wind through its adiabatic expansion",
    ". such chaotic field would give a much more isotropic pressure , which would impress itself on the random velocities of the gas .",
    "we may estimate the effect by assuming the pressures driving the wind are in equipartition with the kinetic energy of random motions ( turbulence ) in the gas .",
    "for this condition the driving energy is @xmath89 per degree of freedom ( three of them ) , @xmath90 being the number of particles in a random blob of mass @xmath91 . the kinetic energy of the blob is @xmath92 ( per degree of freedom ) , so that equipartition gives @xmath93 = @xmath94 , or @xmath95 where we have taken the average mass per particle to be 1.3@xmath96 .",
    "this is to within a factor of @xmath97 of the sound velocity , but for our elevated artificial temperature . for values of the driving temperature ,",
    "@xmath39 ( table 2 , column 4 ) , we get the turbulent velocities given in table 2 , column 9 .",
    "these values are comparable to the line - of - sight random velocities measured in cool ( super)giants , and this fact argues that the driving force must be able to produce the random motions observed .",
    "it is unlikely , therefore , to be global alfven waves .",
    "of course , the pressure of these turbulent motions is itself a major source of momentum and energy in extending the atmosphere and driving the wind .",
    "energy input determines the magnetic fields required in this model , since the magnetic energy density must be greater than the energy per unit volume required to lift the mass out of the potential of the star , b@xmath98/8@xmath99 @xmath85 g@xmath26@xmath34/. for our model , this leads to a field strength of 25 gauss .",
    "if we assume the energy loss is double the potential energy from kinetic energy of the wind and emission from it , the field strength increases only to 35 gauss .",
    "this kind of driving has the advantage over alfven waves of being able to begin to explain the variation of mass loss from star to star in a way related to stellar structure and evolution . in our simulation of driving with thermal profile , the expansion - velocity structure",
    "is determined by the temperature ( i.e. , energy - density ) profile , while the mass - loss rate is arbitrary , determined by supplying enough energy at some  to maintain the energy - density profile . with magnetic - flux emergence as the driving mechanism",
    ", the magnetic energy corresponds to the infusion of thermal energy in the coronal model ; mass loss rate , therefore , is proportional to the rate at which magnetic field emerges .",
    "this is very attractive in that there are indications that the winds of the giants vary in response to changes that can re - excite dynamos in their cores .",
    "see mullan & macdonald ( 2003 ) for changes of mundane giants , and recall the shells episodically thrown off by pulsing agb stars .",
    "alfven waves , on the other hand , would most likely be excited by convection , therefore be proportional to luminosity , and be little affected by the strength of the passive magnetic fields serving as their medium .",
    "as an alternative to chaotic magnetic fields filling the voids in chromospheric gas , we may imagine alfven waves trapped in the cavities between ionized blobs .",
    "these waves would have speeds approaching the speed of light as the density dropped , and would be reflected off the blobs if their frequencies were below the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the critical frequency would rise as the material became more highly compressed ( denser ) .",
    "eaton & bell actually had this mechanism in mind as the driving pressure in such atmospheres .",
    "there must be a rich optics of these alfven waves waiting to be discovered .",
    "i have constructed a model for the chromosphere and wind of 31  cyg which is based on measurements of physical properties in the outer atmospheres of 31  cug and other classical @xmath3  aur binaries .",
    "it goes beyond other such models in that it derives the poorly understood turbulence and clumping of the gas from the pressures driving the wind s expansion .",
    "it predicts emission of optically - thin lines and microwave continuum to within 50  %  of observed values , excellent agreement in the circumstances . in this model , the momentum flux required to drive",
    "the wind determines the stratification of the chromosphere where intrinsic lines would be formed .",
    "that momentum flux gives much lower densities than the stratification from thermal momentum flux alone , with the consequence that the gas must be clumped to produce the observed flux in intrinsic lines .",
    "we also find that this model can reproduce most of the properties of single stars chromospheric spectra and argue that the evidence for fundamental differences between single stars and these binary components is rather weak .",
    "we must keep in mind , however , that there are some inconsistencies in this picture .",
    "the ionization of c , for instance , is a problem .",
    "it can not be mostly singly ionized , as it seems to be observationally , without giving fluxes much larger than observed , and the model for 31  cyg does not predict the redshifts seen in single supergiants .",
    "2 ] multiplet ratios from the model likewise would not predict the large global electron densities found from 2 ] in single stars",
    ". however , there are also inconsistencies in the interpretation of 2 ] in the single stars themselves , as i discuss in   4.4 .",
    "i dedicate this paper to john s.  mathis who seemed to have the visceral intuitive grasp of physics required to address the sort of problems i have discused in this paper .",
