    "the standard cosmological model , the @xmath0cdm model ( @xmath0 denotes the cosmological constant ) , assumes the presently observed cosmic substratum mainly to consist of a cosmological - constant type dark - energy ( de ) together with pressureless cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "these dark components make up about 95% of the cosmic energy budget .  usual \"",
    ", i.e. baryonic , matter only contributes with less than 5% .",
    "the present fractions of radiation and curvature are dynamically negligible .",
    "the standard model describes well a large number of observations and its parameters have been determined by now with high precision @xcite . on the other hand , the theoretical status of the standard model is anything but satisfactory .",
    "the model relies on the existence of a dark sector which is physically not really understood .",
    "moreover , despite of its observational success there remain tensions @xcite .",
    "while no straightforward fundamental progress seems to be in sight at the moment , this situation requires further ( semi- ) phenomenological studies of potential deviations from the standard model as well as of modifications both of the matter sector ( right - hand side of einstein s equations ) and of the geometric sector ( left - hand side of einstein s equations ) .",
    "the simple cosmological - constant model has been  dynamized \" in several ways . even before the advent of the observations of supernovae of type ia ( snia ) by @xcite which supported the idea of a universe in accelerated expansion ,",
    "a scalar field ( sf ) has been suggested as an agent that might drive the cosmological dynamics @xcite .",
    "further studies along this line were performed in @xcite .    a fluid dynamical description which is able to account both for an early matter - dominated phase and for effects similar to those generated by a cosmological constant has been established in terms of ( generalized ) chaplygin gases .",
    "the original chaplygin gas @xcite is characterized by an equation of state ( eos ) @xmath1 .",
    "it was applied to cosmology in @xcite followed by @xcite . a phenomenological generalization to an eos @xmath2 with a constant @xmath3 was introduced in @xcite . for @xmath4",
    "this generalization reduces to the original chaplygin gas , for @xmath5 it is related to the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "an appealing feature of the ( generalized ) chaplygin gas ( gcg ) is its capability of a unified description of the dark sector .",
    "its energy density is changing smoothly from that of nonrelativistic matter at high redshift to an almost constant far - future value .",
    "thus it interpolates between an early phase of decelerated expansion , necessary for successful structure formation , and a late period in which it acts similarly as a cosmological constant , generating an accelerated expansion .",
    "cosmological models relying on the dynamics of generalized chaplygin gases have been widely studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "while both sf based models and models aiming at a unified description of the dark sector of the type of gcgs have separately attracted ample attention , our aim in this letter is to investigate a model in which a gcg and a sf are simultaneously present ( gcsf model ) in addition to a pressureless matter component which is supposed to describe the baryon fraction of the universe . in this preliminary study",
    "we restrict ourselves to the homogeneous and isotropic background dynamics , a detailed perturbation theory of such model will be the subject of a subsequent paper . by suitable parameter choices the gcsf model has a @xmath0cdm limit which allows to investigate deviations from the latter in various directions .",
    "we use snia and @xmath6 data to test whether the observations admit a dark sector of the gcsf type .    in sec .",
    "[ basic ] we recall the basic properties of the gcg and sf components of the dark sector and find the hubble rate of the gcsf model . the data analysis and its interpretation is the subject of sec .",

    "[ summary ] summarizes our results .",
    "we assume a perfect - fluid structure of the cosmic medium as a whole , described by the energy - momentum tensor @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total energy density , @xmath9 is the total pressure and @xmath10 is the four - velocity of the cosmic substratum as a whole , normalized to @xmath11 . assuming also a homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat universe with a robertson - walker metric , the total energy - momentum conservation reduces to @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hubble rate and @xmath14 is the scale factor of the robertson - walker metric .",
    "the total energy - momentum tensor in ( [ t ] ) is split into a gcg ( subindex @xmath15 ) , a sf component ( subindex @xmath16 ) , a matter component ( subindex @xmath17 ) and radiation ( subindex @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 we assume perfect - fluid structures of each of the components as well ( @xmath20 ) and separate energy - momentum conservation @xmath21 in general , the @xmath22 velocities of the components are different from each other and from the total four velocity @xmath10 as well .",
    "however , we assume them to coincide in the homogeneous and isotropic background , @xmath23 the energy conservation equations for the components are @xmath24      the equation of state for the gcg is @xmath25 for the sf we use an effective fluid description with @xmath26 its effective @xmath22 velocity is determined by the ( timelike ) gradient of the sf , @xmath27 as far as the matter component with @xmath28 is concerned , our main interest here is baryonic matter , but in some special cases below also cdm will be included .",

    "now we confront the cgsf model with data from snia and @xmath6 data .",
    "while the radiation component will be relevant in a future study of the cosmic microwave background , it may be safely neglected in these background tests .",
    "the remaining five free parameters of the model then are @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath62 is defined by @xmath63 .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 will be fixed to either @xmath65 or , alternatively , to @xmath66 or @xmath67 . to get a better understanding of the combined model",
    ", we shall also evaluate the limiting cases of a vanishing sf contribution ( the gcg describes the entire dark sector ) as well as the case of a sf with a certain amount of pressureless matter ( no gcg ) .",

    "the corresponding @xmath73 function is constructed according to @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the covariance matrix @xcite .    as a second observational source we consider the evaluation of differential age data of old galaxies that have evolved passively @xcite .",
    "here we use the 36 measurements of @xmath6 listed in @xcite which consist of 30 differential age measurements and 6 data from an analysis of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) .",

    "we admit a larger additional matter fraction . strictly speaking",
    ", such choice is against the motivation of a unified description of the dark sector , but it is included here for comparison . in the fourth line we recover the conventional , well - known chaplygin - gas dynamics .",
    "the fifth line with a present eos parameter @xmath90 does not correspond to an accelerated expansion of the present universe .",
    "there might have been accelerated expansion in the past , however .",
    "the last two lines of table i describe sf universes with @xmath91 without a cgc . in the second - last line the matter fraction @xmath85 is purely baryonic again , i.e. , the sf accounts for the entire dark sector , in the last line with @xmath89 the universe is made of a sf and cdm .",
    "this case is close to the @xmath0cdm model at the present time .",
    "one may suspect that the large value of @xmath58 and the small values of @xmath60 ( both not typical for viable chaplygin gas models ) in the first three lines indicate degeneracies in the parameter space . to get a consistent picture we performed an alternative analysis",
