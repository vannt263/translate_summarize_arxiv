    "<S> laser cooling is a fundamental technique used in primary atomic frequency standards  @xcite , quantum computers  @xcite , quantum condensed matter physics  @xcite and tests of fundamental physics  @xcite , among other areas . </S>",
    "<S> it has been known since the early 1990s that laser cooling can , in principle , be improved by using squeezed light as an electromagnetic reservoir  @xcite ; while quantum feedback control using a squeezed light probe is also predicted to allow improved cooling . here , </S>",
    "<S> we implement quantum feedback control of a micro - mechanical oscillator for the first time with a squeezed probe field . </S>",
    "<S> this allows quantum - enhanced feedback cooling with a measurement rate greater than it is possible with classical light , and a consequent reduction in the final oscillator temperature . </S>",
    "<S> our results have significance for future applications in areas ranging from quantum information networks  @xcite , to quantum - enhanced force and displacement measurements  @xcite and fundamental tests of macroscopic quantum mechanics  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1    real - time quantum feedback control  @xcite often involves time - continuous measurements of a quantum state followed by control of a physical system with the aim of steering that system into a desired state . </S>",
    "<S> such control has been demonstrated in numerous experiments , including the preparation of microwave fock states  @xcite and the generation of deterministic entanglement in quantum superconducting circuits  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantum feedback control also allows the control of motional states via continuous measurements of a probe field followed by actuation back upon the motional degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> it has been used to steer single trapped atoms  @xcite , levitated microspheres  @xcite , micromechanical oscillators  @xcite and suspended kilogram - scale mirrors  @xcite towards their motional ground states ; and proposed as a means to prepare both mechanical fock  @xcite and superposition states  @xcite . however , to - date , all such experiments have used a classical probe field .    the use of a non - classical probe field for quantum control can both increase the effectiveness of steering to the desired quantum state and introduce new functionalities . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it can be used to prepare a mechanical oscillator in a non - gaussian quantum state even in the linear coupling regime  @xcite , thereby circumventing the usual requirement to reach the single - photon strong coupling regime  @xcite . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , quantum feedback control using squeezed light can enable an efficient interface for quantum information networks  @xcite , and allow the standard quantum limit of force measurements to be surpassed via squeezing - enhanced measurements  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a first critical step towards such functionalities by realizing a quantum - enhanced cooling rate using a squeezed probe field and real - time feedback control of a mechanical mode .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is to continuously monitor the position of the mechanical oscillator and subsequently use the measurement record to steer the oscillator towards the ground state with real - time feedback . </S>",
    "<S> the cooling rate is limited by the precision with which the position of the oscillator can be monitored , which in turn is often limited by the noise of the tracking laser beam  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by engineering the quantum state of the laser beam to reduce the measurement noise , an enhanced cooling rate can be expected . </S>",
    "<S> using squeezed light with variance @xmath0 to continuously monitor the mechanical motion , a feedback loop with signal detection efficiency @xmath1 , an overall detection efficiency @xmath2 for the squeezed light , and feedback gain @xmath3 , can lower the temperature to @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the detected variance @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the equilibrium temperature of the mechanical oscillator prior to feedback cooling , @xmath8 the corresponding mean phonon occupancy , and we have neglected radiation pressure induced heating due to the measurement process . considering a cavity opto - mechanical system with cavity energy decay rate @xmath9 and mechanical dissipation rate @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> , the linearised interaction is characterised by the cooperativity @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the single - photon opto - mechanical coupling strength and @xmath13 the mean intra - cavity photon number . </S>",
    "<S> as the feedback gain is increased , the temperature drops , reaching a minimum for @xmath14 . at higher gain </S>",
    "<S> the oscillator begins to heat up due to the imparted measurement noise . </S>",
    "<S> in essence , the application of squeezed measurement noise acts to shift this onset of heating to higher gain values , thereby allowing cooling to temperatures below the shot noise imposed limit , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic]d . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the improved cooling efficiency can be appreciated as a consequence of an increased measurement rate @xmath15 , resulting from the squeezing - enhanced signal - to - noise ratio of the transduced mechanical motion  @xcite . in comparison to a coherent state probe , </S>",
    "<S> the improvement is directly given by the degree of squeezing as @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> as the measurement rate is intimately related to the ability to achieve ground state cooling , requiring @xmath17 , squeezing - enhanced feedback cooling can greatly relax the structural requirements for the mechanical oscillator and thereby facilitate the preparation of macroscopic oscillators in their motional ground state . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that improved cooling can be also realized by increasing the power of the probe beam . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is challenging , in practice , to achieve cooling rates sufficient for ground state cooling due to localised bulk heating introduced by absorption of the probe field .    the experimental setup for squeezed light enhanced feedback cooling is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic]a and a scanning electron micrograph of the opto - mechanical system  a micro - toroidal resonator  is displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : schematic]b .    to demonstrate the principle of quantum - enhanced feedback cooling , we chose to work with the fundamental flexural mode of the micro - toroid . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical resonance frequency of the mode was @xmath18 , well within the bandwidth of our feedback loop , and its effective mass was determined to be via finite element modelling . </S>",
    "<S> from the optically read out position power spectral density shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : coolcurves]c the damping rate was characterised to be @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that , the predominantly vertical motion ( see finite element model in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : coolcurves]c ) of the fundamental flexural mode reduces the strength with which it couples to the optical field . while the coupling is sufficient for our proof - of - principle demonstration , stronger coupling  sufficient to enter the quantum - coherent coupling regime  @xcite  can be achieved using a radial breathing mode . </S>",
    "<S> this was precluded in our case , since the resonance frequency @xmath20 of this mode lays outside of our available control bandwidth .    </S>",
    "<S> * a * +   + * b * +   + * c * +    * a * +   + * b * +    in a first experiment , we implemented feedback cooling using coherent states of light with a power of . </S>",
    "<S> the results are illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : coolcurves ] , where we cooled from a temperature of down to the limit set by the imprecision noise corresponding to the quantum noise of a coherent state . </S>",
    "<S> we carefully characterized the noise floor through attenuation measurements and balanced detection to verify that it is of true quantum origin , that is , pure vacuum noise . </S>",
    "<S> as the feedback gain is increased , the temperature of the mechanical mode is decreased to . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the gain further leads to heating of the oscillator as the shot noise of the probing field dominates the control .    </S>",
    "<S> the demonstration of squeezed light enhanced cooling is presented in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : coolcurves ] . here </S>",
    "<S> , we used the same coherent excitation as for the coherent state cooling experiment , but the quantum fluctuations of the probe beam were now suppressed below vacuum noise . </S>",
    "<S> the actual noise suppression of the generated squeezed state was @xmath21 ( see supplementary information ) , but as a result of evanescent coupling and propagation losses in the tapered fibre , the measured noise reduction was limited to @xmath22 below the vacuum noise . despite the losses a considerable increase in measurement rate of @xmath23 was achieved , and by applying the electronic feedback a clear suppression of the transduced thermally excited mechanical displacement fluctuations was observed , ultimately reaching the squeezed noise level well below shot noise . as a direct result of employing quantum - enhanced feedback cooling , </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical mode was cooled to an effective temperature of , more than lower than the minimum temperature achieved using coherent light .    </S>",
    "<S> a complementary characterisation of the demonstrated cooling scheme is provided by examining the time - domain phase space trajectory of the mechanical oscillator . due to the large bandwidth of the homodyne detector compared to the mechanical dissipation rate , this could be monitored in real - time by simultaneous down - mixing of the homodyne photo - current with two in - quadrature signals and subsequent low - pass filtering  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the recorded thermal trajectories are visualised in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : coolcurves]b . </S>",
    "<S> both probing strategies result in a significant confinement of the oscillator s random excursions in phase space when subject to feedback cooling . while the enhancement by using squeezed light is not directly obvious from the phase space trajectories ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : coolcurves]b ) the effect is more pronounced by considering the marginal quadrature distributions ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : coolcurves]c ) , revealing a reduction in the variance of the cooled oscillator s position for the squeezed light probe , which is in good agreement with the temperature reduction .    the resulting temperature estimates as function of inferred feedback gain </S>",
    "<S> are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results]a . a clear cooling improvement is observed for increasing gain until the thermal noise spectrum reaches the measurement imprecision noise level , after which the mechanical oscillator begins to heat up due to measurement noise being imprinted on its motion . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the reduced imprecision noise of the squeezed probe shifts the onset of heating towards larger feedback gain values , allowing quantum - enabled cooling to temperatures below the limit set by shot noise .    </S>",
    "<S> the absolute cooling achieved in the present demonstration is only modest compared to state - of - the - art  @xcite , the main limitations being the relatively poor opto - mechanical cooperativity provided by the flexural mode and the requirement for operating in the under - coupled regime to preserve squeezing .    </S>",
    "<S> considerable improvements in cooling performance can be expected by using an opto - mechanical system with enhanced cooperativity , and realising higher coupling and detection efficiencies for the squeezed mode . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , operating the system of wilson et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the under - coupled regime ( @xmath24 at a coupling efficiency of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the intra - cavity photon number of @xmath27 ) so that the injected squeezed light reflects from the cavity with high efficiency , with unity detection efficiency , and starting from @xmath28 , enables cooling to an occupation number @xmath29 phonons . </S>",
    "<S> using a squeezed probe with an input squeezing of , the occupation number could be lowered to @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that achieving close to unity detection efficiency is challenging for current quantum opto - mechanics experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this presents a serious constraint for quantum feedback control experiments . indeed , with the experimentally realised efficiency reported by wilson et al .  of @xmath31 , </S>",
    "<S> even when achieving a cooperativity @xmath32 , the minimum mechanical occupancy that could be achieved with coherent light  @xcite is @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , while squeezed light is degraded by inefficiencies , it also provides a mechanism to mitigate them in feedback control experiments . </S>",
    "<S> if , amplitude- , rather than phase squeezing is used the contribution of vacuum noise entering the phase quadrature due to inefficiencies is suppressed relative to the amplified noise of the phase quadrature . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a higher effective efficiency for feedback control experiments of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes the intra - cavity variance ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see that when @xmath36 , @xmath37 approaches unity . as an example , assuming an intra - cavity phase anti - squeezing variance above shot noise , the effective feedback cooling efficiency of wilson et al .  could be increased to @xmath38 , allowing , in principle , feedback cooling to an occupancy of @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that the full benefit of squeezing - enhanced feedback cooling could be harnessed using recently developed tethered membrane mechanical oscillators  @xcite in conjunction with a high - quality optical cavity , or alternatively , by implementation in state - of - the - art opto - mechanical systems in the microwave regime  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our demonstration of enhanced real - time quantum feedback exploiting squeezed state probing opens up a new avenue in the field of quantum opto - mechanics . besides the demonstrated cooling effect </S>",
    "<S> , it lays the foundation for more advanced schemes including squeezing - enhanced quantum back - action evasion which in turn can be used to prepare mechanically squeezed states in the weak coupling regime and for generation of non - gaussian mechanical quantum states . as an example , combining of squeezing with active feedback in a pulsed backaction evading scheme  @xcite , it is possible to squeeze the mechanical oscillator by for an interaction strength of @xmath40 , while for a coherent state input , @xmath41 is required to squeeze the mechanics by the same amount . moreover , supplementing the scheme with photon - subtraction , the mechanics can be driven into a quantum non - gaussian state even for a modest interaction strength . </S>"
