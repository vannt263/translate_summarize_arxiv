    "when fitting theory to data in the presence of background uncertainties , the question of whether the spectral shape of the background is similar to that of the theoretical model of physical interest has not generally been considered previously .",
    "these correlations in shape are considered in the present note and found to make important corrections to the calculations .",
    "some causal correlations between background and the theoretical model are usually included at present .",
    "for example , beam normalization uncertainties affect both the theoretical model and the background .",
    "there are also some correlations when the size of the theoretical model affects the size of the background .",
    "however , when the theoretical model parameters are allowed to vary in a fit , there is a new , qualitatively different , correlation that should be considered if the error matrix includes the effects of uncertainties in the backgrounds .",
    "this correlation is not a causal correlation , but occurs simply due to a similarity between the spectrum of the theoretical model over the bins and the spectrum of the backgrounds .",
    "this similarity can be quantified using a regression analysis .",
    "these correlations should , perhaps , be distinguished by being called `` regression correlations '' .    including these new correlations",
    "provides a more powerful test for confidence regions .",
    "use of monte carlo simulations to estimate confidence regions ( `` fake data studies '' ) as described in section 6 give valid confidence regions with or without the corrections described here .",
    "however , the use of these correlations allows a more powerful test , often giving smaller regions for a given confidence level .",
    "this effect will be illustrated in the numerical example studied in section 7 .",
    "a chisquare fit will often not have chisquare distribution with or without the corrections here .",
    "the problem , which is well , but sometimes not widely known , is that systematic background errors are really different than the statistical errors . if an experiment is repeated , the numbers of events are different each time because of the statistical errors . however , the background expectation is the same each time .",
    "nature has chosen some value .",
    "the systematic error here is the uncertainty in our knowledge of what is that value , a bayesian concept which does not fit comfortably in the frequentist @xmath0 method .",
    "when this systematic effect is included in the error matrix as if it were a statistical error , a chisquare probability may not result .",
    "this point will also be illustrated in the numerical example in section 7 .",

    "for the first fitting method , the parameters assigned to the background(s ) are held fixed in the fit at their measured values .",
    "the uncertainty in the background parameters enters into the covariance used in the fit .",
    "the covariance matrix of the signal in bins @xmath20 is given as    @xmath21    @xmath22 is diagonal and is the variance expected for the data in each bin given the theory plus background prediction for the mean number of events in that bin .",

    "a second approach uses a constrained fit to account for backgrounds , constraining the backgrounds to be at their measured values within errors , when performing fits .",
    "the @xmath0 is written as a @xmath0 ignoring the background uncertainties and a sum of terms ( `` pulls '' ) for each background .",

    "it is then completely straightforward to combine the two measurements to get an estimate for the value of @xmath37 and the uncertainties of that estimate .",
    "the subtlety here is that both @xmath37 and @xmath42 are involved in the fit .",
    "if a fixed value of @xmath37 is used and there is no fit , the question of correlation between @xmath37 and @xmath42 does not enter and , for the first method , the @xmath0 distribution should include @xmath59 .",

    "the variables can be changed from @xmath37 , @xmath42 to the independent variables @xmath58 , @xmath42 with a jacobian of one .",
    "then the probability of the @xmath42 term can be integrated out and , as with the @xmath0 fits , only @xmath69 remains    @xmath70    another method to treat the correlation problem would be to make a combined fit for the background and the model parameters using the combined histograms for both the present experiment and the background experiments .",

    "is determined by @xmath74 and @xmath38 by a function of @xmath73 .",
    "the two parameters work together to produce a single spectrum . for a background which matches the shape for a given @xmath73 ,",
    "any mis - estimate of the scale of the background will appear in the fitted value of @xmath74 and the correlated part of the background should be associated with that parameter .",
    "the individual terms in the sum of model terms will sometimes be these composite terms .",
    "this occurs , for example in fits of neutrino data for sterile neutrino hypotheses .",
    "there will sometimes also be more complicated dependences than the simple ones here and it is necessary to examine the situation for each particular experiment as indicated in the last section .    for determining confidence regions , consider a theoretical model point a. if the absolute @xmath0 is to be used and a is a fixed point , not the result of a fit , then the regression correlations should not be included in the calculation of probability . if there is a fit ,",
    "regression correlations should be used .",
    "the @xmath180 method , ( @xmath188 ) is a test often used to determine confidence regions .",
    "the @xmath0 at a using the regression correlations at a minus the best fit @xmath0 using the regression correlations at the best fit should then be used .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath0 returns the probability of @xmath175 . to find a confidence region for the theoretical parameters , the set of @xmath37 s , it is , in principle , necessary to convolute the @xmath0 probability with the probability for the background uncertainties .",
    "see the discussion following equation 30 .",
    "if the fit explicitly included the theory and background , and only modified the covariance for the correlations , then the theory parameters for the minimum are already the appropriate ones , for the first @xmath0 method discussed in section 2 .",
    "however , for the constrained fit method the change in background value must be taken into account .",
    "calculation of this change will be discussed in the next section .    for fake data studies",
    "the experiment is replicated a number of times with monte carlo events .",
    "the theoretical model is held fixed , however , for each repetition , the backgrounds are varied randomly within their uncertainties .",
    "these studies are useful for estimating the expected variance of the result , for examining the effects of individual backgrounds , and for examining the sensitivity to the values of the uncertainties of these backgrounds .",
    "they are widely used , because they do not depend on knowing the form of psudo-@xmath0 probability distributions in advance .",
    "they give valid confidence level regions for any valid test .",
    "however , the use of regression correlations makes the test more powerful as will be seen in the numerical example in section 7 .",
    "consider an analogy .",
    "suppose one estimates the distance between two objects on a somewhat blurry image , obtaining an estimated distance and the uncertainty of that estimate .",
    "if a better focussed image is available , a new estimate can be made .",
    "both estimates are correct given the images each has used , but the estimate from the more focussed image can be considered a more optimum estimate .",
    "in the presence of the correlations discussed in this note , there is no change to the usual procedure for choosing monte carlo events .",
    "the regression correlations do not enter and only the usual backgrounds are randomly varied .",
    "what happens next depends upon the question asked .",
    "suppose there is no fit and the question asked is , `` what is the distribution of @xmath0 if the model parameters are fixed ? '' for this question , the regression correlations do not enter .",
    "however , suppose there is a fit , and it is desired to find the probability that a specific theoretical model a would give at least as high a @xmath0 as obtained in the real data .",
    "a number of fake data samples are generated for model a and , for each , the @xmath0 for a and the @xmath0 values for the best fit are found using the regression correlations .",
    "then , if the @xmath189 method is used , the likelihood of that model is estimated by the fraction of times that the monte carlo @xmath180 is greater or equal to the @xmath190 value obtained for the data . if an absolute @xmath0 method is used , then the likelihood is the fraction of time that the monte carlo result is larger than the data @xmath0 .",
    "if the model and background correlations vary with the model point and the regression correlations are ignored , the best fit point may be different .    at present , the use of an `` effective number of degrees of freedom '' is frequently employed to give corrections to the nominal number .",
    "the effective number of degrees of freedom is found by fitting the @xmath0 curve found from fake data studies .",
    "as noted in section 3 , the presence of systematic background uncertainties , means that , with or without these corrections , the probability distribution may not have a @xmath0 shape . with this new procedure",
    "the effective number should be closer to the real number , because the size of the background uncertainty included in the error matrix is reduced . it is still be useful to include the new effective number as a residual correction .",
    "the example taken here is a simplified version of the neutrino oscillation search in the miniboone experiment .",
    "no miniboone data were used .",
    "@xmath75 events are a very major background to the search for @xmath71 events . in this example",
    "it is taken as the only backround . the expected background ( @xmath75-events )",
    "were taken from  @xcite .",
    "the background uncertainty was taken as a simple scale factor of 15% for the expected number of @xmath75 background events in each bin .",
    "the number of data events was taken to be approximately the same as the number of events in the miniboone @xmath191 run  @xcite .",
    "eight bins of energy were used .",
