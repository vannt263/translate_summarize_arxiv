    "to improve cdma systems , there are many works of designing spreading sequences .",

    "other approaches are to derive sequences which satisfy the equality of the limitation . in cdma systems ,",
    "crosscorrelation is treated as a basic component of interference noise and autocorrelation is related to synchronization at the receiver side and the fading noise , thus , it is desirable that the first peak of crosscorrelation and the second peak in autocorrelation should be kept low .",

    "this result shows that snr will become higher when we resuce mean - square auto correlation and crosscorrelation low .",

    "then , we derive the necessary conditions for the global solution and evaluate .    a remaining issue is to obtain the better expression of snr .",
    "we have used the relation that @xmath109 has the upper bound . from this reason ,",
    "our upper bound is rough",
