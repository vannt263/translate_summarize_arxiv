    "within the past decade , astrophysical x - ray emission via charge exchange ( cx ) has been recognized to occcur in comets , the atmospheres of planets including the earth , throughout the heliosphere , and around other stars ( see review by @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , observations with moderate spectral resolution by _ chandra _  @xcite and _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite have detected clear signatures of geocoronal and heliospheric cx , most prominently in time - variable oxygen line emission , which may contribute a significant fraction of the soft x - ray background .",
    "all the aforementioned cx emission is from moderately ionized species such as he - like and h - like c , n , o , and ne which originate in solar or stellar coronae .",
    "those ions emit x rays when they cx with : neutral molecules such as h@xmath0o in comets ; neutral h in the earth s outer atmosphere ; and neutral interstellar h and he within the heliosphere or astrospheres around other stars .",
    "cx has also been proposed @xcite to explain some and perhaps most of the line emission from more highly ionized species such as he - like and h - like si , s , ar , ca , and fe observed in diffuse emission from the galactic ridge ( gr ) and galactic center ( gc ) @xcite . according to this hypothesis , which is one of several competing explanations of gc / gr line emission ( see muno et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and references therein ) , the highly charged ions are low - energy cosmic rays that cx with neutral gas in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "this cx mechanism would naturally explain the remarkable similarity in the spectral shapes of gc and gr diffuse emission from widely separated regions of the galaxy , since the emission arises from essentially the same population of ions with the intensity level primarily determined by the supply of neutral gas .",
    "galactic plane x - ray emission from cosmic - ray cx was in fact first considered by @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies of this idea , including those by @xcite , @xcite , and especially @xcite , concluded that the fraction of nearly fully ionized cosmic rays is negligible below several mev amu@xmath2 , well above the energy at which cx cross sections begin a precipitous decline ( @xmath1@xmath10 kev amu@xmath2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "most of the k - shell line flux was therefore predicted to be emitted from cosmic rays with kinetic energies of 1 mev amu@xmath2  or more ( @xmath110 mev amu@xmath2  for fe ) .",
    "for fe lines this corresponds to doppler widths of roughly 1 kev , much larger than the @xmath1170 ev fwhm broadening measured by @xcite and @xcite in an _ asca _  spectrum of the gc .",
    "more recently , @xcite observed several gc fields with _",
    "chandra _  and deduced that fe line broadening was probably no more than @xmath1100 ev and could be consistent with zero .",
    "for comparison , the doppler broadening for fe ly@xmath9 in a plasma with @xmath11 kev is @xmath17 ev . more importantly , because of the small cx cross sections at these high collision energies , cx line emission would be several orders of magnitude too weak to explain the galactic plane emission .",
    "because of solar modulation , however , there are no measurements of the interstellar cosmic ray flux or ionization state below @xmath11 gev amu@xmath2@xcite , so these predictions remain theoretical .",
    "likewise , experimental cross section data for ion - ism collisions in the  mev amu@xmath2  energy range are sparse and theoretical calculations can have large errors . in addition",
    ", none of the studies to date have modeled more poorly understood processes such as multi - electron cx or multi - electron ionization .",
    "although these effects were believed to be relatively minor , the last process in particular will extend the @xmath1fully ionized regime to somewhat lower energies .",
    "@xcite noted that multi - electron ionization may be especially important when the target nuclear charge is greater than that of the cosmic ray , and they also assumed for simplicity that the interstellar medium was entirely neutral .",
    "heavy element abundance enhancements toward the center of the galaxy , which were not considered , will also increase some effective cross sections , given that the importance of o , fe , and other metals as neutral targets outweighs that of atomic h at the relevant collision energies .",
    "given these uncertainties , a cosmic - ray cx explanation for some of the galactic center and galactic ridge diffuse line emission should not yet be completely discounted , particularly for emission from lower charged cosmic - ray ions ( e.g. , @xmath12-kev l - shell photons from cx of he - like through f - like fe ) which are more abundant at lower energies where cx cross sections are larger .",
    "it is also worth noting that consideration of the cosmic - ray ionization balance naturally leads to predictions of roughly two to three times as much he - like emission as h - like emission for all elements @xcite , in agreement with the ratios observed in _ asca _",
    "spectra of the gc and gr @xcite .    under certain conditions",
    "cx may also be a significant contributor to x - ray emission from highly charged ions that are _ thermally _ ionized .",
    "in addition to the many examples of solar wind cx described above , such conditions may occur in the galactic center as highly ionized plasma interacts with neutral gas on the boundaries of the dense molecular clouds that exist there .",
    "another possibility is the mixture of shocked gas and evaporating clouds in supernova remnants , as has been considered by @xcite .",
    "the fraction of total emission in such cases is likely to be small , but cx emission can be distinguished from electron impact excitation by its unique spectral signatures , as discussed in  2 .",
    "_ microcalorimeter detector on _ astro - e2_@xcite , which has 6-ev resolution , is particularly well suited to the study of supernova remnants given its non - dispersive spectral capability .",
    "xrs _ also should be able to provide definitive measurements regarding the relevance of cx emission in the galactic center and galactic ridge , although its modest collecting area and small field of view will necessitate very long exposures to do so .    in the next section",
    "we briefly review the cx mechanism and discuss key diagnostics of cx emission that can be used in the analysis of _ astro - e2 _  spectra . in ",
    "3 we describe our experiment , followed by an explanation of data analysis procedures in  4 , discussion of results in  5 , and conclusions in  6 .",
    "cx is the radiationless collisional transfer of one or more electrons from a neutral atom or molecule to an ion .",
    "if the recipient ion is highly charged it is left in an excited state which then decays via radiative cascades , or if the neutral species donates more than one electron , by some combination of radiative decay and autoionization .",
    "single - electron capture generally dominates for highly charged ions ; multiple - electron cx is discussed in  5.4 .",
    "since no photons are emitted during the electron transfer , the sum of the internal energies of the ion and atom / molecule are conserved , and the donated electron(s ) can be transferred only to specific levels in the ion .",
    "the resonant character of the electron transfer is softened somewhat by distortion of the energy levels of ion and atom during the collision , so that a range of atomic states is accessible . for low collision energies ( up to @xmath1100 kev amu@xmath2 ) , the @xmath3 level with the largest capture probability for single - electron transfer is given approximately by @xcite ( rewriting to explicitly include the neutral species ionization potential ) as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ion charge , @xmath15 is the ionization potential of the neutral species , and @xmath16 is the ionization potential of atomic h ( 13.6 ev ) . for fe@xmath8 and fe@xmath4 colliding with h at low energies ,",
    "@xmath17 is therefore expected to be @xmath112 .",
    "molecular nitrogen has an ionization potential of 15.6 ev ( 14.5 ev for atomic n ) , so @xmath17 for cx with n@xmath0 is nearly the same as with h. at low collision energies , the @xmath3-distribution has a fairly sharp maximum , but gradually broadens to its widest at @xmath18 kev amu@xmath2 . at even higher energies , @xmath17 slowly decreases and the distribution narrows again @xcite .    the angular momentum ( @xmath19 ) distribution varies more strongly with collision energy .",
    "the details of this energy dependence are important because they affect how the excited ion can radiatively decay , e.g. , directly to ground if @xmath20 , or via cascades for large values of initial @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath19 distribution is especially important in the cx of fully stripped ions , which yields excited hydrogenic ions .",
    "for example , if the initial excited level is an @xmath21 state , it can decay directly to the @xmath22 ground state yielding a ly@xmath23  photon .",
    "if the ion starts from an @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , or other state , however , it can not decay to ground because of the @xmath28 selection rule .",
    "instead , the ion is likely to end up decaying along the `` yrast chain '' in sequential @xmath29 steps with @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , ultimately resulting in ly@xmath9  emission .    at low collision energies ,",
    "low-@xmath19 states are most likely to be populated @xcite and the combined intensity of high-@xmath3 lines ( @xmath32 ) may exceed that of ly@xmath9  @xcite . as energy increases , however , the @xmath19 distribution becomes more statistical in nature ( in proportion to @xmath33 ) and fewer of the initial states can decay directly to ground , resulting in a higher fraction of ly@xmath9  emission .",
    "the hardness ratio of high-@xmath3 versus ly@xmath9  emission can thus be used as a diagnostic of collision energy , as illustrated for and by @xcite . at the higher energies of relevance for cosmic - ray cx ( @xmath34 kev amu@xmath2 ) only a few percent of the x - ray emission",
    "is from high-@xmath3 states .",
    "the absence of significant high-@xmath3 fe lines in observations of diffuse emission from the galactic ridge and galactic center therefore does not necessarily indicate the absence of cosmic - ray cx emission ( cf .",
    "enhanced high-@xmath3 emission _ is _ expected , however , when collision energies are low , e.g. , in the highly ionized plasma / molecular cloud scenarios described in  1 .",
    "the hardness ratio of emission from he - like ions is much less sensitive to collision energy because the @xmath35 line ( k@xmath9 ) always dominates . from simple spin statistics , following electron transfer",
    "a he - like ion will have total spin @xmath36 about 3/4 of the time , and @xmath37 only 1/4 of the time .",
    "since only @xmath38 transitions are allowed , none of the high-@xmath3 @xmath36 ( triplet ) states can decay to the @xmath37 ( singlet ) @xmath39 ground state , and instead the excited electron cascades to one of the @xmath40 triplet states from which it ultimately decays via a forbidden or semi - permitted transition .    within the @xmath40 level ,",
    "the triplet @xmath41 and @xmath42 states that give rise to the `` intercombination '' and `` forbidden '' lines , respectively , receive much more of the cascade - derived population than the singlet @xmath43 state that yields the `` resonance '' line .",
    "the triplet lines are therefore much stronger relative to the resonance line in cx spectra than they are in thermal plasmas .",
    "( see recent measurements by @xcite and theoretical predictions by @xcite . )",
    "given adequate energy resolution , this is an excellent indicator of cx emission , regardless of ion - neutral collision energy . as we illustrate in  [ sec : results - energies ] , even if the k@xmath9  lines are instrumentally blended one may still be able to use the energy centroid of the blend to distinguish between cx and thermal emission .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite report that in the two regions near the gc that yielded the most precise spectral fitting results , the k@xmath9  energy was measured to be @xmath44 and @xmath45 ev , significantly less than the 6700-ev energy of the resonance line that dominates collisional spectra , and very close to the centroid energy we measure in our cx spectrum ( see  5 ) .",
    "the energy calibration for these measurements , however , had to be shifted by 33 ev for reasons that are not well understood ; the absolute uncertainty in energies is probably something like @xmath46 ev , so drawing firm conclusions about forbidden - line enhancement in the gc is risky .",
    "our experiment used the lawrence livermore national laboratory ( llnl ) ebit - ii electron beam ion trap to collect  and  cx spectra using n@xmath0 as the neutral gas .",
    "the operation of ebits has been described extensively elsewhere @xcite as has the magnetic trapping mode @xcite used for these measurements . to briefly summarize ,",
    "singly or doubly charged fe ions are injected into the ebit - ii trap region from a metal vapor vacuum arc ( mevva ) where they are longitudinally confined by an electrostatic potential and radially confined by a 3-t magnetic field , as well as by electrostatic attraction of the narrow ( 60-@xmath47 m ) electron beam .",
    "the beam , with a current of 140 ma for all our measurements , passes vertically through the short trap region ( 2 cm tall ) where it collisionally ionizes and excites the relatively stationary ions .",
    "a neutral gas injector and several spectrometers are arrayed azimuthally around the ion / electron / gas interaction region .",
    "the neutral target gas is injected directly into the trap where some n@xmath0 molecules cx with the trapped fe ions before being ionized and dissociated themselves . although cx cross sections are much larger than those for electron impact excitation and ionization ( of order @xmath48 @xmath49 versus @xmath50 @xmath49 in this case ) , the neutral gas has a much lower density than the electron beam ( @xmath51@xmath52 @xmath53 versus @xmath1@xmath54 @xmath53 ) and the cx collision velocity ( essentially equal to the ion velocity ,",
    "@xmath51@xmath52 cm s@xmath2 ) is much smaller than the electron beam velocity ( @xmath1@xmath55 cm s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the product of ion density and the effective emission volume ( determined by the electron beam diameter when the beam is on and the ion cloud size when the beam is off ) is roughly the same whether the beam is on or off , so the rate of cx interactions is only @xmath11% that for electron - ion collisions .",
    "cx spectra are therefore collected in the magnetic trapping mode with the electron beam turned off ( response time @xmath160 @xmath47s ) once the desired ion charge balance has been attained , which takes roughly 1 second . the ions are still confined ( though less densely ) within the trap region , where they collide with neutral nitrogen molecules , undergo cx , and emit photons . as illustrated in figure 2 of @xcite , the magnetic trapping mode allows a weak cx spectrum , which would otherwise be swamped by the much stronger electron - impact collisional spectrum , to be revealed .",
    "our measurements record the net result of all relevant cx processes , whether from single or multi - electron transfer , radiative decays , or autoionization , as manifested by their spectra .",
    "two high - purity ge detectors with energy resolutions of @xmath56 ev and @xmath57 ev ( fwhm at 7 kev ) , were used to collect spectra .",
    "the signal - processing lower level discriminators were set at 5 and 4 kev , respectively , to exclude unnecessary events and prevent event pile - up .",
    "all the results we present were obtained with the higher - resolution detector , but the second detector with its lower energy threshold was helpful in identifying trap contaminants .    because the detector resolution was insufficient to directly separate the spectra of  and , data were collected in two measurements using different electron beam energies .",
    "the low - energy run ( l ) used @xmath58 kev , and the two high - energy runs ( i and j ) were at 17.2 kev . for comparison , the ionization potentials of li - like fe@xmath59 , he - like fe@xmath6 , and h - like fe@xmath4 are 2.046 , 8.828 , and 9.278 kev , respectively ( see table  [ table : energies ] ) . during run",
    "l most of the trapped ions were he - like , with a small fraction of h - like .",
    "the observed cx spectrum was therefore a nearly pure he - like spectrum .",
    "( the li - like cx spectrum lies below 2 kev , well below the lower level discriminator setting . ) in runs i and j ( 17.2 kev ) , the trap contained significant fractions of he - like , h - like , and bare ions , with a roughly 2:1 ratio of fe@xmath4 and fe@xmath8 , resulting in a mixed cx spectrum of he - like  and h - like  lines .",

    "therefore , must be with the theory we are comparing against , which presents two possibilities : either model predictions of cx with h are wrong for the @xmath215 and collision energies we are using , or those predictions are not applicable because we are not using atomic h as the target .",
    "theoretical modeling at the low energies involved here is less reliable than at higher energies because of the quasi - molecular states temporarily formed during slow collisions , but cx of a bare ion with h is the simplest cx system to model and errors should be small .",

    "we therefore believe that the second possibility is much more likely .",
    "a multi - electron target immediately raises the possibility that multi - electron capture ( which we will henceforth assume means double - electron capture ) is important .",
    "however , the fundamental issue to keep in mind , whether discussing single - electron capture or dec , is the angular momentum distribution of the captured electron(s ) . in order to explain the intensity of the high-@xmath3 lines , a large fraction of the radiatively decaying levels must be @xmath169 states that can decay directly to the @xmath22 ground state .    unfortunately , there are virtually no experimental publications that even roughly match the ebit parameter space with respect to ion and collision energy , i.e. , nearly fully stripped ions with @xmath217 with collision energy @xmath110 ev amu@xmath2 .",
    "the two main experimental cx regimes are those of electron cyclotron resonance ( ecr ) sources and heavy - ion storage rings .",
    "the former can not create bare ions beyond @xmath1ne@xmath218 and generally operate at collision energies of a few to several tens of kev amu@xmath2 , and the latter use even higher energies ( @xmath219 mev amu@xmath2 ) , well above the range of applicability to ebit results . for various instrumental reasons and",
    "because the ions are moving , those experiments usually focus on total cx cross sections and/or recoil - ion momentum or auger - electron energy spectroscopy .",
    "naturally , theoretical efforts have focused on available experimental data , and are also limited to relatively tractable models of cx with h , he , and h@xmath0 . only a small fraction of cx papers of any kind discuss angular - momentum distributions and even fewer present photon emission spectra .",
    "the paper closest to matching our experimental parameters is @xcite which presents data on cx of bare",
    "n , o , f , ne , na , and al with various noble gas targets at an energy of about 1 kev amu@xmath2 , but does not discuss @xmath19 or include spectra .",
    "@xcite present results on o@xmath220 + h and h@xmath0 at 14 kev amu@xmath2 ; although there are no spectra , the ` @xmath221 value ' plot in their figure 11 indicates that the angular momentum distribution is different for cx with h and h@xmath0 .",
    "this is illustrated more clearly in their plots for ar@xmath220 , although that ion is far from fully stripped .",
    "we suspect that the high-@xmath3 enhancement we observe is simply due to creation of a larger @xmath169-state population in cx with n@xmath0 than in cx with h , and that dec , while present at some level , is not the key to the high-@xmath3 emission enhancement , as we now explain .",
    "there are many papers that discuss dec .",
    "the one most relevant for us is that by @xcite , which discusses dec in ne@xmath222he with collision energies from 50 ev amu@xmath2  to 15 kev amu@xmath2 , and includes helpful summaries of various dec - related processes such as autoexcitation ( ae ) , correlated double capture ( cdc ) , correlated transfer and excitation ( cte ) , and auto - transfer to rydberg states ( atr ) .",
    "it also presents several conclusions regarding symmetric autoionizing states ( with @xmath223 ) , asymmetric autoionizing states ( with @xmath224 ) , and the contributions to radiative stabilization of those states as a function of collision energy .    for doubly - excited fe@xmath6",
    ", a typical symmetric state will be @xmath225 @xmath226 , while @xmath227 @xmath228 and @xmath229 @xmath230 are examples of asymmetric states .",
    "such states can either : 1 ) autoionize to ground ( not interesting here because no photon is emitted ) , 2 ) autoionize to a singly excited state resulting in autoionizing double capture ( adc ) and the emission of one h - like photon , or 3 ) radiatively stabilize resulting in true double capture ( tdc ) and the emission of one @xmath231 1 he - like satellite of a h - like line and one true he - like line .    in adc , because continuum levels are more densely populated at lower energies , the retained electron will tend to fall to a level such that the ejected electron has just enough energy to escape .",
    "the resulting singly excited state will thus still have a medium @xmath3 value ( @xmath17 , for both symmetric and asymmetric autoionizing initial states ) , but less than the @xmath3 for sec ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "unknown , however , is the typical @xmath19 value and thus what fraction of the adc radiative decays go directly to ground ( from @xmath169 states ) and what fraction end up feeding the yrast cascade yielding ly@xmath9  photons . in the first case , the enhanced medium-@xmath3 emission will blend with the high-@xmath3 peak and broaden it , and also move the centroid to lower energies .",
    "we do not see any significant broadening , however , and the peak centroid energy is if anything higher than expected from sec , which would indicate that the fraction of adc is fairly small . in the second case ,",
    "the fraction of ly@xmath9  emission is enhanced over that for sec , which is the opposite of the enhanced high-@xmath3 emission we are attempting to explain .",
    "tdc tends to occur from asymmetric autoionizing states ( either populated directly during dec or after auto - transfer from more symmetric states via atr  this appears to be a matter of some controversy ) because configuration interaction between the two widely separated electrons is minimal and they act nearly independently . the first radiative decay , usually from the lower @xmath3 level because radiative rates scale as roughly @xmath232 , produces a he - like satellite line ( effectively a h - like line with a high-@xmath3 spectator electron ) .",
    "like adc , this enhances either the medium-@xmath3 line emission or ly@xmath9 .",
    "the second tdc radiative decay results in a he - like photon that originates from a singly excited high-@xmath3 state , often with @xmath3 higher than is the case for sec .",
    "for the same reasons as in the sec spectrum ( because of the @xmath233 selection rule  see  2 ) the resulting he - like emission will be dominated by @xmath234 emission ( i.e. , k@xmath9 ) .",
    "the signature of dec in the he - like spectrum will therefore be very hard to discern , and indeed we see no difference in the run - l ( pure sec ) and run - ij  ( sec + dec ) spectra .    to summarize , dec should either increase the relative intensity of ly@xmath9  ( which is not inconsistent with the observed spectrum but would not explain the large high-@xmath3 peak ) or increase the medium-@xmath3 lyman emission ( which would manifest itself as broadening of the high-@xmath3 peak and move its centroid to a lower energy , which is not seen in our measurements ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that dec is not the source of the high-@xmath3 emission lyman enhancement . instead",
    ", we believe that cx of high-@xmath215 fully stripped ions yields very different excited - state angular momentum distributions depending on whether the neutral target has one or many electrons , with a much larger fraction of @xmath169 states in the latter case . measurements utilizing higher - resolution detectors , which we plan to conduct over the next few years , will address this and other questions .",
    "we have presented experimental charge exchange spectra of fe@xmath235 and fe@xmath236 interacting with n@xmath0 at collision energies of @xmath237 ev amu@xmath2 .",
    "the resulting h - like and he - like spectra show significant enhancement of high-@xmath3 emission with respect to electron impact excitation spectra .",
    "this high-@xmath3 excess is especially pronounced in the  spectrum and , as has been observed in other measurements of moderate- and high-@xmath215 h - like emission at low collision energies , is much stronger than predicted by classical - trajectory monte carlo models of cx with atomic h. our measurements indicate that this is likely because the @xmath19-distribution of the captured electron(s ) depends on whether the neutral target has one or many electrons",
    ".    cx emission may be detectable in the galactic ridge and galactic center , arising from low - energy cosmic rays or highly ionized thermal gas interacting with neutral clouds in the galactic plane .",
    "two key diagnostics of this emission are : strong enhancement of forbidden and intercombination line emission in the he - like k@xmath9  complex ( exemplified by a 19-ev shift in the k@xmath9  blend centroid in our experiment ) ; and enhancement of high-@xmath3 emission in the h - like lyman spectrum , particularly if the emission is from thermal ions .",
    "line widths can be used to discriminate between cosmic - ray cx ( with widths greater than 100 ev fwhm for fe ) and thermal cx ( less than 10-ev widths ) .",
    "the xrs microcalorimeter on the just - launched _ astro - e2 _  therefore should be able , given sufficiently deep observations , to clearly identify the spectral signatures of cx in diffuse x - ray emission from the galactic center and galactic ridge , and perhaps in some supernova remnants .",

    "<S> we present h - like  and he - like charge - exchange spectra resulting from collisions of highly charged iron with n@xmath0 gas at an energy of @xmath110 ev amu@xmath2  in an electron beam ion trap . although individual high-@xmath3 emission lines are not resolved in our measurements , we observe that the most likely level for fe@xmath4 @xmath5 fe@xmath6 electron capture is @xmath7 , in line with expectations , while the most likely value for fe@xmath8 @xmath5 fe@xmath4 charge exchange is significantly higher . in the  spectrum , </S>",
    "<S> the k@xmath9  emission feature dominates , whether produced via charge exchange or collisional excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the k@xmath9  centroid is lower in energy for the former case than the latter ( 6666 versus 6685 ev , respectively ) , as expected because of the strong enhancement of emission from the forbidden and intercombination lines , relative to the resonance line , in charge - exchange spectra . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the  high-@xmath3 lyman lines have a summed intensity greater than that of ly@xmath9 , and are substantially stronger than predicted from theoretical calculations of charge exchange with atomic h. we conclude that the angular momentum distribution resulting from electron capture using a multi - electron target gas is significantly different from that obtained with h , resulting in the observed high-@xmath3 enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> a discussion is presented of the relevance of our results to studies of diffuse fe emission in the galactic center and galactic ridge , particularly with _ astro - e2/suzaku_. </S>"
