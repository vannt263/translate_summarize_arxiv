    "by analogy to an isotropic @xmath2wave pairing , for superconductors with an enough large coherence length @xmath1 , the amplitude of paring potential @xmath3 tends be the same for all bonds but disorder induces the effect of fluctuations in the amplitude leading , in this way , to destruction of pairing . here",
    "we will calculate fluctuating potentials standard deviations @xmath4 and @xmath5 their ratio @xmath6 will be a criterion of pairing potential fluctuations @xcite .",
    "= 4.5 cm = 4.5 cm",
    "we start a single band , extended , hubbard model with effective nearest neighbour intersite attraction @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) @xcite . taking the fourier transform of the green function for a clean system we can write its equation of motion : @xmath9 { { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$g$ } } }   } } ^0 ( { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$k$ } } }   } ; \\omega)= { { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$1 $ } } }   } } , \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 defines @xmath11 matrix of a pairing potential . for a clean system @xmath12",
    "can be expressed in @xmath13-space : @xmath14 @xmath15 , where @xmath16 represents the nearest neighbour site amplitude of electron hopping , while @xmath17 corresponds to next nearest neighbour one .",
    "for the assumed solution @xcite @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding free energy @xmath21 for a finite temperature @xmath22 can be found from the standard formula : @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the eigenvalue . to perform numerical calculations",
    "we have fitted our one band system parameters to the realistic @xmath25 band structure of sr@xmath26ruo@xmath27 @xcite fig .",
    "1a presents the corresponding fermi surface . for the above assumptions we have found three solutions with @xmath0wave pairing .",
    "namely , depending on relative values @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the dipole one ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , the real one ( @xmath32 ) and the complex one ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "they correspond to minima of free energy curves ( @xmath34 ) in fig .",

    "the interaction parameter used in calculations ( w=-0.446 t ) were chosen to give @xmath35k as for clean sr@xmath26ruo@xmath27 .",
    "one can easily see that the complex solution reaches the global minimum of free energy @xmath21 .",
    "in this section we investigate the stability of superconducting @xmath0wave states in presence of a weak disorder . here",
    ", we apply the same strategy as in @xcite and we treat random site energies @xmath36 as perturbations .",
    "to proceed we write the dyson equation for a green function @xmath37 evaluated at a frequency @xmath38 :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the impurity potential matrix .",

    "( [ eq13 ] ) we express quantity order parameter @xmath41 , in the lowest order of @xmath36 perturbations by means of disordered green function and calculate the mean square deviation of the paring @xmath41 along the bond of nearest neighbour sites @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for site",

    "@xmath47 has a very small value ( of order @xmath48 ) .",
    "this implies that fluctuations of @xmath41 are relatively small in this system .",
    "interestingly , a real type solution is characterized by the smallest fluctuations ( @xmath49 ) while @xmath50 for the dipole solution and @xmath51 for the complex one .",
    "this could mean that the real solution is favoured by disorder .",
    "we have analyzed the effect of a weak disorder on a @xmath0wave superconductor in context of newly discovered superconductor sr@xmath26ruo@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the order parameter structure in this compound is still unknown @xcite .",
    "fitting our system parameters to its @xmath25 band structure we have asked about the stability of various solution in presence of disorder .",
    "we have found three solutions with the same critical temperature @xmath52k : dipole and real solutions with line nodes in the gap and complex one with a finite gap in any direction .",
    "note that , all these solutions have the same critical temperature @xmath53 and the abrikosov ",
    "gorkov formula @xcite does not differentiate any of them . our preliminary results at @xmath54 indicate that the complex type of solution has the global minimum of free energy @xmath21 but the real one is favoured by disorder . that result was obtained in one band model in the lowest order of perturbation method and should be confirmed by a more sophisticated method like coherent potential approximation @xcite considering more realistic three bands structure of sr@xmath26ruo@xmath27 .",
