    "after the introduction of toroidal multipoles in the static case @xcite , the dynamic toroidal multipoles were presented as a new independent multipole family that had been previously ignored @xcite .",
    "the new family was derived from the split of the transverse multipoles of electric parity into two parts .",
    "these parts are often referred to as electric and toroidal .",
    "the dynamic toroidal multipoles have also been analyzed in refs .",
    ", and are currently being considered in the areas of metamaterials , plasmonics , and nanophotonics @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we analyze the split between the dynamic electric and toroidal multipoles of a localized source distribution .",
    "we find that the two parts can not be separately determined by measuring the electromagnetic fields produced by the source outside the source region .",
    "the two parts can also not be separately determined by measuring the coupling between the source and externally incident electromagnetic waves .",
    "the result applies to both near and far field situations , and implies that there is no independent coupling of toroidal character between the sources and the electromagnetic field , and that there is no radiation of pure toroidal character .",
    "the toroidal multipoles can hence not be considered an independent family .",
    "rather , our analysis makes clear that the electric and toroidal parts correspond , respectively , to the lowest and the higher order terms of the expansion of the exact multipolar coefficients of electric parity with respect to the electromagnetic size of the source . while proving the lack of independent physical meaning of the toroidal multipoles , our results do not question the usefulness of considering such higher order terms .",
    "the accuracy and prediction ability of lowest order models is improved by the inclusion of some higher order terms @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "our article contains analytical expressions that inherently contain all correction orders : they are exact for any source size .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we outline the mathematical setting in which we carry out the analysis .",
    "we then highlight the direct connections between our momentum space approach and the physics of multipolar couplings between sources and fields . on the one hand ,",
    "three kinds of degrees of freedom are needed to describe the sources .",
    "two of them are transverse and have opposite ( electric vs. magnetic ) parity , and the other one is longitudinal . on the other hand ,",
    "only the two transverse degrees of freedom are needed to describe the electromagnetic fields produced by the sources outside the source region , where the field produced by the longitudinal degrees of freedom is identically zero .    in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we analyze the physical meaning of the toroidal multipoles .",
    "our analysis starts from recently obtained exact analytical expressions for the transverse multipolar coefficients of electric parity .",
    "these expressions are valid for any source size @xcite .",
    "we take the dipolar case as the guiding example , make the small source approximation keeping the two lowest orders , and show that : the lowest order term is the well know approximate expression for the electric dipole of electromagnetically small sources ; the term of second lowest order is the approximate expression for the toroidal dipole of electromagnetically small sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . 2.11 ) .",
    "we then analyze the original split @xcite in the general multipolar case , and establish that both electric and toroidal parts contain non - radiative components , which appear due to the separation of terms of different order in the size of the source .",
    "these non - radiative components , which cancel each other when both parts are summed , preclude the separate determination of each part by measuring the radiation from the source outside the source region , or by measuring the coupling between the source and externally incident electromagnetic waves .",
    "afterwards , we analyze a different class of splits where the two parts are free of this kind of non - radiative components .",
    "we find that , in this case , what precludes their independent measurement is the absence of longitudinal radiation .",
    "we show in app .",
    "[ appc ] that this is the same reason that precludes the independent measurement of the recently proposed re - definition of toroidal multipoles ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ sec4 ] , we use the obtained insights to clarify some statements that are often found in the literature .",

    "the lower limit of the integral in @xmath7 excludes the static case @xmath8 , which we do not treat in this paper .",

    "we then show that each of the two parts contains longitudinal components that can not be detected from outside the source region .",
    "to finalize , we discuss some statements that are often found in the toroidal literature .",

    "we have shown that the @xmath71 can not be separately determined , and can hence not constitute a third independent multipolar family .",
    "it is also often stated that three multipolar families , including the toroidal one , are needed in order to expand a general charge - current distribution , while the radiation that they emit can be described with only two multipolar families @xcite .",
    "starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq2:expand ] ) , our analysis makes clear that , indeed , three multipolar families are needed to describe the source , and only two are needed to describe the fields radiated by it .",
    "it also makes clear that the third family is constituted by the longitudinal multipoles , and _ not _ the toroidal multipoles .",
    "the fact that the longitudinal field is zero outside the sources explains why the number of necessary multipolar families decreases by one when going from the sources to the fields .    finally , it is also stated @xcite that the toroidal multipoles can be separated using spectroscopic techniques .",
    "the separation is to be enabled by exploiting the extra frequency dependent weighting of the toroidal multipoles [ @xmath72 with respect to the electric multipoles .",
    "the steps going from eqs .",
    "( [ eq2:aexact ] ) to ( [ eq2:tapprox ] ) reveal that the different @xmath73 scaling comes from the different terms in the series expansion of the spherical bessel functions .",

    "one can make a similar expansion of the magnetic multipoles @xmath75 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "each of this doubly infinite number of formally obtained terms is not an independent degree of freedom .",
    "the multipolar electromagnetic transitions that determine the spectroscopic response of a system of charges and currents are completely characterized by using the two possible parities , electric and magnetic .",

    "our analysis proves that the dynamic toroidal multipoles do not have an independent physical meaning with respect to their interaction with electromagnetic waves .",
