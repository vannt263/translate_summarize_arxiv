    "in the interiors of solar and extrasolar  @xcite giant planets , light elements such as hydrogen and helium are exposed to extreme temperature ( @xmath210000k ) and pressure ( 10  1000 gpa ) conditions .",
    "shock wave measurements  @xcite are the preferred experimental technique to reach such conditions in the laboratory",
    ". lasers  @xcite , magnetic fields  @xcite , and explosives  @xcite have recently been used to generate shock waves that reached megabar pressures .",
    "the challenge of these experiments is first to reach such extreme conditions and secondly to characterize the properties of the material with sufficient accuracy so that planetary interior model actually can be improved .",
    "single shock experiments yield the highest accuracy to the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "however those can rarely reach densities much higher than 4 times the starting density , which means a large part of giant planet interiors can not be probed directly  @xcite .",
    "the limitation in density has recently been addressed by combining static compression in a diamond anvil cell with dynamic shock compression  @xcite .",
    "the experiments by eggert _ et al .",
    "_ reached pressures of 200 gpa in helium , which is a significant increase compared to the gas gun experiments by nellis _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite from 1984 that had reached 16 gpa on the principal hugoniot .",
    "the properties of dense helium have also be the subject of a series of recent theoretical investigations with first - principles simulation techniques . in  @xcite , helium was predicted to reach 5.24-fold compression in shock experiments .",
    "the compression ratio is larger than 4 because of electronic excitations that occur in the fluid at high temperature .",
    "et al . _",

    "@xcite studied dense helium in order to characterize the atmosphere of white dwarfs .",
    "the paper went beyond the generalized gradient approximation by considering hybrid functionals .",
    "stixrude and jeanloz  @xcite studied the band gap closure in the dense fluid helium over a wide range of densities including conditions of giant planet interiors .",
    "two recent studies of jupiter s interior  @xcite , to very different extent , relied on a helium eos derived the dft - md .    the insulator - to - metal transition in solid helium at high pressure was the subject of a recent quantum monte carlo study  @xcite that showed that standard density functional methods underestimate the band gap by 4 ev , which means the metallization pressure is underestimated by 40% .    in this article ,",
    "path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) and density functional molecular dynamics ( dft - md ) simulations are combined to study pair correlation functions in fluid helium over a large density and temperature interval .",
    "this paper expands upon an earlier work  @xcite that demonstrated that dft - md results at lower temperatures and pimc data at higher temperatures can be combined into one coherent eos table .",
    "@xcite also provide a free energy fit , computed adiabats and the electronic density of states .",
    "the eos was compared with different semi - analytical free energy models  @xcite .",
    "path integral monte carlo  @xcite is the most appropriate and efficient first - principles simulation techniques for quantum system with thermal excitations .",
    "electrons and nuclei are treated equally as paths , although the zero - point motion of the nuclei as well as exchange effects are negligible for the temperatures under consideration .",
    "the coulomb interaction between electrons and nuclei is introduced using pair density matrices that we derived using the eigenstates of the two - body coulomb problem  @xcite .",
    "the periodic images were treated using an optimized ewald break - up  @xcite that we applied to the pair action  @xcite .",
    "the explicit treatment of electrons as paths leads to the fermion sign problem , which requires one to introduce the only uncontrolled approximation in this method , the fixed node approximation  @xcite .",
    "we use the nodes from the free - particle density matrix and from a variational density matrix  @xcite .",
    "besides this approximation , all correlation effects are included in pimc , which for example leads an exact treatment of the isolated helium atom .",
    "we performed pimc simulations with 32 and 57 atoms .",
    "additional details are given in reference  @xcite .",
    "the dft - md simulations were performed with either the cpmd code  @xcite using local troullier - martins norm - conserving pseudopotentials  @xcite or with the vienna ab initio simulation package  @xcite using the projector augmented - wave method  @xcite .",
    "the nuclei were propagated using born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics with forces derived from either the electronic ground state or by including thermally excited electronic states when needed .",
    "exchange - correlation effects were described by the perdew - burke - ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation  @xcite .",
    "the electronic wavefunctions were expanded in a plane - wave basis with energy cut - off of 30 - 50 hartrees .",
    "most simulations were performed with @xmath3=64 using @xmath4 point sampling of the brillioun zone .",

    "the density will be discussed in terms of the wigner - seitz radius , @xmath5 , that is defined by @xmath6 .",
    "there is a substantial difference in the slopes of the isochores in figure  [ pt ] . at low temperature and high density ,",
    "the isochores are nearly vertical because the dominant contribution to the pressure is provided by degenerate electrons .",
    "it takes a significant increase in temperature before thermal excitations of the electrons add in a noticible way to the pressure and for isochores to bend over to high pressures . at lower densities ,",
    "the biggest contribution comes from the ionic motion , and one finds the typical pressure - temperature relation of a dense , but not degenerate fluid .    .",
