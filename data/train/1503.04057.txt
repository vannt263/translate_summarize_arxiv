    "it appears that the fast - slow analysis used to get the singular solution , for any of the models we have discussed , does not apply to the slow pulse .",
    "hence it appears difficult to use geometric perturbation to obtain this solution .  in [ @xcite this solution",
    "was obtained in the fitzhugh - nagumo case using dynamical systems methods , but only for @xmath705 sufficiently close to @xmath706    the analysis in @xcite was in the region @xmath705 close to @xmath707 @xmath20 and @xmath16 small .",
    "indeed , if @xmath708 then there is only one pulse and it is a standing wave ( @xmath709 ) .",
    "it is proved in @xcite that for @xmath710 positive but small there is a smooth curve @xmath711 corresponding to pulse solutions and connecting @xmath712 to @xmath366 the speeds @xmath712 and @xmath406 and the maximum of @xmath713 in @xmath714 $ ] all tend to zero as @xmath715     we suspect that a similar picture holds for the model of faye , but it is not clear that our analysis is able to prove this much .  the fitzhugh - nagumo condition that @xmath716 is small would be replaced here by requiring that @xmath717 is small .",
    "we said in the introduction that there was only a partial existence result for the model in @xcite .",
    "we were referring there to a recent paper by faye and scheel @xcite , which uses an interesting extension of the geometric perturbation method to infinite dimensional spaces to handle this kind of problem .",
    "the method is powerful because it allows an extension beyond the sorts of kernel which reduce the problem to an ode .",
    "faye and scheel remark that their paper appears to apply to the pinto - ermentrout model .",
    "this is true , but with a limitation .",
    "a key hypothesis in their paper is that for the singular solution , as described above , the jump down occurs above the knee . in a private communication professor ermentrout",
    "has observed that while this is true for the pinto - ermentrout model in some parameter ranges , it is also common for the down - jump to occur at the knee .",
    "this is why we characterized their result as \" partial  for pinto - ermentrout .",
    "unfortunately , we have not been able to make our approach work for pinto - ermentrout .",
    "the reason may be related to an important difference between ( [ 1 ] ) and the equivalent set of ode s obtained from ( [ pe ] ) .",
    "the linearization of ( [ 1 ] ) around its equilibrium point has only real eigenvalues , for any @xmath21 while the equivalent linearization for ( [ pe ] ) has complex eigenvalues for a range of positive @xmath20 .",
    "thus , a homoclinic orbit would oscillate around equilibrium .",
    "a few oscillations could occur even for the very small values of @xmath20 where the eigenvalues are real .",
    "the final steps in our proof above clearly do not allow such oscillations .",
    "in [ @xcite ] we showed that there was co - existence of complex roots and a homoclinic orbit for fitzhugh - nagumo , and observed that work of evans , fenichel and feroe then implied the existence of many periodic solutions and a form of chaos .",
    "this leads to a conjecture that the pinto - ermentrout model supports a richer variety of bounded solutions than the model of faye .",
    "the new solutions are probably unstable , however , so their physical importance is unclear .",
    "a local stability result for the fast solution was proved by faye .",
    "his proof depends crucially on analysis of both the front and back of his solution , as described above .",
    "the analysis of the back is less standard because of the assumption that the jump down is at the knee .",
    "here he relies on previous work on similar problems .",
    "presumably if the jump were above the knee ( where , however his existence proof is not claimed to apply ) , the stability analysis would be easier .",
    "condition ( [ i ] ) says that the solution @xmath117 is on the unstable manifold @xmath718 of ( [ 1 ] ) at the equilibrium point @xmath719 to check condition ( [ ii ] ) we must follow @xmath117 until a point where @xmath720 our proposal for doing this is based on @xcite , where a similar procedure was followed for the well known equations of lorenz .    using a standard ode solver we can arrive at a conjectured value for @xmath721 to begin analyzing @xmath117",
    "numerically we would expand the solutions around @xmath719 a high order expansion of @xmath172 results in algebraic expressions which are then evaluated using rigorous numerical analysis based on interval arithmetic . with this technique",
    "one hopes to show that @xmath172 enters a very small box near @xmath170 . for the example in @xcite this box had a diameter of about @xmath722 this gives us an initial estimate accurate to ( say ) 68 significant digits .",
    "from there , a rigorous ode solver , as described for example in @xcite , would be used to continue @xmath117 until @xmath723 whether this can be done can not be determined ahead of time .",
    "one has to run the solver .",
    "the number of guaranteed accurate digits decreases as the integration proceeds .",
    "we then hope that some significant digits would be maintained long enough to reach @xmath724 it must be checked along the way that @xmath725    based on the great sensitivity of the lorenz equations to the initial conditions , we expect that this would be easier for the faye model than it was in @xcite . we are not aware of any proposal to try to estimate @xmath20 for the method of geometric perturbation .    99    alefeld , g. and mayer , g. , interval analysis , theory and applications , _ j. comp",

    "<S> gave perhaps the first rigorous proof of the existence ( and stability ) of a travelling pulse solution for a model of this type , treating a simplified version of equations originally developed by kilpatrick and bressloff . </S>",

    "<S> we extend faye s results on existence by dropping one of his key hypotheses , proving the existence of pulses at at least two different speeds , and in a sense , allowing a wider range of the small parameter in the problem .  </S>",
