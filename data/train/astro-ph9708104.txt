    "if the physical conditions in the damped ly@xmath0 systems are similar to those in galactic interstellar clouds , the damped ly@xmath0 systems should show absorption from low - ionization species like c i , trace elements like ni , zn and cr and molecules like h@xmath3 and co. most of these species have been detected in absorption in the damped ly@xmath0 systems ( e.g. foltz _ et al .",

    "high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) spectra are required because the expected lines are very weak .",

    "there are two damped ly@xmath0 systems at z = 2.1408 and z = 2.8115 .",
    "the z = 2.8115 damped ly@xmath0 system has n(h i ) @xmath4 @xmath5 and is one of the highest column density damped ly@xmath0 systems known ( mller & warren 1993 ) .",

    "( 1988 ) have detected h@xmath3 absorption associated with it .",
    "lanzetta ( 1994 , private communication ) and songaila & cowie ( 1995 ) have further confirmed this detection .",
    "the redshift for the h@xmath3 absorption is z = 2.8118 ( lanzetta 1994 , private communication ) . the column density of molecular hydrogen , n(h@xmath3 ) = 2.6@xmath6 @xmath5 , a factor of 10 larger than the upper limits for other damped systems ( songaila & cowie 1995 ; levshakov _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "the molecular fraction f=2n(h@xmath3)/[2n(h@xmath3)+n(h i)]=1.2@xmath7 is similar to the milky way diffuse clouds ( savage _ et al .",
    "previous observations show that the h@xmath3 , co and c i column densities are correlated with each other in the milky way diffuse clouds , e.g. n(h@xmath3)/n(c i ) is @xmath8 - @xmath9 and n(c i)/n(co ) is @xmath10 ( e.g. federman _ et al .",
    "thus , we expect that the c i and co column densities are high enough to be detectable .",
    "mller & warren ( 1993 ) detected ly@xmath0 emission at z = 2.8121 .",
    "the detected ly@xmath0 line luminosity of 1.1@xmath11 ergs s@xmath12 corresponds to a star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath13 m@xmath14yr@xmath12 , if there is no attenuation by dust ( we adopt q@xmath15 , h@xmath16 km  s@xmath12mpc@xmath12 ) .",
    "the minimum size of the absorber is about 18@xmath17 kpc .    to study the nature of the z = 2.8115 damped ly@xmath0 system we have conducted two kinds of observations : ( 1 ) high signal - to - noise optical spectroscopy covering the strongest absorption bands of the co a - x system ( 0 - 0 , 1 - 0 , 2 - 0 , 3 - 0 , 4 - 0 , 5 - 0 , 6 - 0 ) , c i @xmath18 1560 and some ni ii lines ; and ( 2 ) millimeter observations of co ( j=3 - 2 ) emission at 90 ghz .",
    "the observations are described in section 2 .",
    "identifications of absorption lines are discussed in section 3 .",
    "we discuss our results in section 4 and give a summary in the final section .",
    "the observations of pks 0528 - 250 were obtained on february 14 , 1994 with the loral 800@xmath191200 ccd attached to the red channel spectrograph on the mmt ( schmidt _ et al .",
    "the 1200 l / mm grating was used in first order with 1@xmath20 slit , which resulted in spectral resolution of 2.0   ( fwhm ) , measured from the comparison lamp lines .",
    "the seeing was 0.5@xmath21 ( fwhm ) .",
    "we took three 40 minute exposures with wavelength coverage from 5200   to 6100  .",
    "the quasar was stepped by a few arcseconds along the slit between each exposure to smooth out any residual irregularities in the detector response which remained after flat - fielding .",
    "an exposure of a he - ne - ar - cd - hg lamp and a quartz lamp were done before and after each exposure of the object to provide an accurate wavelength reference , a measure of the instrumental resolution , and a flat - field correction .",
    "bias frames were also obtained .",
    "the spectra were reduced in the standard way using iraf . the summed spectrum weighted by the signal - to - noise from the three exposures",
    "is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is about 50 in most of the wavelength coverage .",
    "the continuum was fitted iteratively using a cubic spline routine .",
    "first the spectrum was divided into some moderately wide bins ( 40 pixels ) and averaged in each bin",
    ". then a cubic spline was fit to these averaged points .",
    "points which deviated negatively by more than two standard deviations were flagged as possible significant lines and rejected for subsequent iterations of the fit .",
    "this process was repeated about six times until the fit did not change , i.e. until the number of flagged pixels above the fit was about equal to the number of pixels below the fit and the reduced chi - squared of all unflagged pixels was near unity ( bechtold 1994 ) .",
    "significant lines were found by measuring the equivalent width in a bin equal to 2.46 times the number of pixels of the fwhm of the comparison lines , and its error ( c.f .",
    "young , sargent & boksenberg 1982 ) .",
    "all such bins where the equivalent width was significant at greater than or equal to 3 @xmath22 were flagged .",
    "the final equivalent width of each absorption line was measured by specifying the wavelength interval for each feature by hand .",
    "the central wavelengths , equivalent widths and their errors are listed in table 1 .",
    "the central wavelength of each line in table 1 is the centroid , weighted by the depth of each pixel in the line profile below the continuum ( c.f .",
    "bechtold 1994 ) .",
    "the error for the central wavelength shown in this table is from the uncertainty in the measurement of the equivalent width .",
    "we neglected the uncertainty from the wavelength calibration because the error from the wavelength calibration is very small , typically less than 0.02  .",
    "all reported wavelengths are vacuum and have been corrected to the heliocentric frame .",
    "our millimeter observations of the z = 2.8108 damped ly@xmath0 system toward pks 0528 - 250 were made in january 1994 at the nrao 12 meter telescope .",
    "all of the observations were done with the dual polarization sis 3 mm mixer receiver , which provided a system temperature of 260 k at 90 ghz .",
    "the central frequency was set to 90.74093 ghz corresponding to the heliocentric redshifted co ( j=3 - 2 ) emission frequency of the z = 2.8108 damped ly@xmath0 system .",
    "the telescope half - power beam width ( hpbw ) , @xmath23 , was 68@xmath21 .",
    "the frequency calibration was checked with observations of orion a. the pointing was checked with observations of q 0607 - 157 .    the spectra were obtained using absolute position switching between the source position and a reference position 3@xmath24 away in azimuth .",
    "we used a 256 channel filter bank spectrometer with a spectral resolution of 2mhz .",
    "we obtained 498 minutes of integration on source in four nights ; scans were six minutes in length .",
    "each scan had the same three bad channels removed before the scans were summed .",
    "two noisy scans were omitted from the final summation . before taking the mean of a channel , we eliminated channels with more than a 10@xmath22 deviation from a robust median . at that point ,",
    "a final 1@xmath22 deviation of each channel was calculated ( walker _ et al .",
    "the final spectrum is shown in figure 2 , where a single linear baseline has been fitted ( by iteratively throwing out channels with intensities greater than 3.5@xmath22 ) and then removed . in figure 2 ,",

    "the absorption line at @xmath49   is consistent with the co a - x 1447.36 absorption line at z@xmath43 . while co @xmath18 1447.36 is one of the strongest co absorption lines ( e.g. field _ et al . _",
    "1983 ; sheffer _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , we failed to detect the co a - x @xmath36 1477.52 , 1509.70 absorption lines which have similar strengths",
    ". the absorption line at 5519.40   could also be the co ii @xmath18 1448 line from the a@xmath42 component of the z = 2.8115 damped system .",
    "then the absorption line at 6000.53   could be co ii @xmath18 1574 lines from the same component .",
    "however , we also failed to detect co ii @xmath36 1466 , 1480 in our spectrum which have similar strengths ( morton 1991 ) . therefore , the identification for the absorption at @xmath18 = 5519.40   is uncertain .",
    "we have constructed models using the cloudy program ( ferland 1993 ) in order to investigate the ionization of the observed species , the spectrum of the uv ionizing radiation field , and the molecular fraction of the damped ly@xmath0 absorption line system at z = 2.8115 .",
    "the column densities for the species observed in the a@xmath42 and a@xmath3 components ( z = 2.8108 , z = 2.8132 ) of the z = 2.81 damped ly@xmath0 system are shown in table 2 .",
    "because the resolution of the available spectra is insufficient to resolve the profiles of the lines listed in table 2 , we use a curve - of - growth analysis to infer column densities .",
    "we adopt the doppler parameter b = 60 km s@xmath12 for lines from the a@xmath42 component and b = 30 km s@xmath12 for lines from the a@xmath3 component which are obtained from the curve - of - growth of fe ii ( meyer _ et al .",
    "if the absorption lines from the a@xmath42 and a@xmath3 components are blended with each other , we adopt b = 100 km s@xmath12 obtained from fitting the lyman lines ( foltz _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ) . however , the si iv and c iv doublets in the a@xmath42 component suggest that the doppler parameter b = 60 km s@xmath12 derived for fe ii lines does not apply .",
    "a higher doppler parameter b = 80 km s@xmath12 gives a better fit .",
    "therefore , we adopt b = 80 km s@xmath12 to calculate column densities of high ionization species , c iv , si iii , si iv , n v , o vi in the a@xmath42 component ( table 2 ) .",
    "the b - values indicate there are probably several velocity components blended with each other in each line",
    ". however , the uncertainties in the column densities from single b - value curve - of - growth analysis may be less than a factor of 2 ( jenkins 1986 ) .",
    "in fact , our derived column densities are consistent with the results given by songaila & cowie ( 1995 ) , and lu _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) based on higher resolution spectra .",
    "as the input to cloudy , we adopt a metallicity of 10% of the solar value for all the elements in both a@xmath42 and a@xmath3 components of the z = 2.8115 damped ly@xmath0 system .",
    "we also consider the relative depletions by dust grains to zn ( about 0.6 - 0.7 in the logarithm unit ) of heavily depleted elements such as al , si , ca , fe and ni ( meyer _ et al . _ 1989 ) .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio is 10% of the milky way and the constituents of dust grains are assumed the same as the milky way .",
    "the total neutral hydrogen column density n(h i ) for the two components is @xmath50 @xmath5 ( mller & warren 1993 ) .",
    "it is obtained by fitting the profile of the damped ly@xmath0 absorption line including the ly@xmath0 emission of the quasar because the redshift of the damped ly@xmath0 system ( z = 2.8115 ) is about the same as that of the quasar ( z = 2.765 , morton _",
    "et al . _ 1980 ; mller & warren 1993 ) . the neutral hydrogen column density for each of the two components in the z",
    "= 2.8115 damped ly@xmath0 system is uncertain .",
    "however , similar absorption of dominant ions of most species , such as o i , si ii , s ii , fe ii , ni ii , in these two components suggest that the total neutral hydrogen column density in each component is also similar ( cf .",
    "table 2 ) .",
    "we take the total column density as the approximate value for each of the components in the following discussion .",
    "there is therefore at least a factor of 2 uncertainty in the results from cloudy from the uncertainty in the neutral hydrogen column density in each velocity component .",
    "since the damped ly@xmath0 system is possibly near the quasar , the uv flux from the quasar can affect the ionization .",
    "we therefore have considered five types of spectral energy distributions ( sed ) .",
    "figure 3 shows these seds , along with the ionization potential of several ions .",
    "we use a power - law with index @xmath51 for @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , measured for pks 0528@xmath54250 by sargent _ et al . _",
    "we extrapolate the power to longer wavelengths which has little affect on our results .",
    "the quasar energy distribution at wavelengths shorter than the lyman limit is uncertain .",
    "we therefore consider two different quasar seds : a(1 ) and a(2 ) ( figure 3 ) .",
    "in these two models , the upper limit to the x - ray flux from the einstein ipc at 1.0 kev is adopted for the wavelength longer than 0.2 kev ( wilkes _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) . in a(1 ) , we assume a power - law with index between the lyman limit and 0.2 kev of @xmath55 ; this is the hardest spectrum that seems reasonable . in a(2 ) , the sed between the lyman limit and 0.2 kev is a power law connecting these two points .",
    "we consider the models for the evolution of galactic sed s , as calculated by bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "the shape of the uv sed in the @xmath56  region does not change after about 0.1 gyr if the sfr is constant , so we consider the sed of 1 gyr old galaxy as representative .",
    "this is shown in the figure 3 as model b. for an age less than 0.1 gyr the sed is similar to the sed of an instantaneous starburst galaxy , which we consider in the next model .",
    "compared with a 1 gyr old constant sfr galaxy sed model , this model lacks hard uv photons because of the lack of agb stars .",
    "this is shown in figure 3 as model c.      we adopt the parameterization of the milky way radiation field by black ( 1987 ) .",
    "this includes starlight , cosmic background radiation , thermal emission of dust , hot interstellar gas heated by supernova remnants , stellar winds , and uv radiation from extragalactic sources such as qsos and nearby active galaxies .",
    "the energy distribution between 13.6 ev and 54 ev is a power law extrapolated from other wavelengths .",
    "this is shown in figure 3 as model d.      the sed is a single power - law from radio to x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the energy distribution between the lyman limit and 1100   is harder than the milky way sed , the constant sfr galaxy sed and the starburst galaxy sed , but is much softer than the quasar seds .",
    "this is shown in figure 3 as model e.    figure 4 shows the cloudy results for low ionization species .",
    "the ordinate is the column density of the various species , and the abscissa is the ionization parameter , u = @xmath57(h)/n(h)c , where @xmath57(h ) is the surface flux of hydrogen - ionizing photons , n(h ) is the total hydrogen number density ( ionized , neutral , and molecular hydrogen ) , and c is the speed of light .",
    "cloudy shows that the column densities of o i , s ii , fe ii , si ii and ni ii , which are the dominant ions of those species in the h i dominant regions , are not sensitive to different sed models over a large range of ionization parameter .",
    "since all sed models give similar results for these ions , we only show the result from model e in figure 4 .",
    "the abundance of these ions from cloudy are consistent with the observed ones within about a factor of two indicating that we have a reasonable set of assumptions for the abundance and depletions .",
    "figure 5 shows the calculated and observed ratios of n(h@xmath3)/n(c i ) in the a@xmath42 component of z = 2.8115 damped system .",
    "the common trend in the figure of n(h@xmath3)/n(c i ) vs. n(c i ) can be explained by molecular hydrogen chemistry .",
    "the main destruction process of h@xmath3 , photodissociation through the process of spontaneous radiative dissociation by the lyman and werner bands , is initiated by discrete line absorptions .",
    "the lines are very narrow .",
    "thus , the lines rapidly become optically thick , and then h@xmath3 shields itself effectively , so that most of the hydrogen forms h@xmath3 ( e.g. van dishoeck 1990 ) .",
    "this is why we see a rapid increase of n(h@xmath3)/n(c i ) vs. n(c i ) when the uv flux drops below a certain threshold .",
    "after that , the abundance of c i still increases as the uv decreases , but the abundance of h@xmath3 increases slowly due to lack of formation material , hydrogen , which has already been changed into h@xmath3 .",
    "this is why the ratio of n(h@xmath3)/n(c i ) decreases after the rapid increase phase .",
    "the best fit to the observed ratios is the starburst model ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "model ( d ) and ( e ) can fit the observed ratios within about 3@xmath22 .",
    "the quasar sed models ( model a(1 ) and a(2 ) ) can not explain the observed ratios .",
    "the observed ratios are best explained by the soft uv energy distribution models , which suggest stars contribute most of the ionizing radiation field in the a@xmath42 component of z = 2.8115 damped ly@xmath0 system .",
    "thus , the sed model where the uv flux is mainly contributed by pks 0528 - 250 can be ruled out , i.e. the distance between the a@xmath42 component and the quasar is probably large enough ( @xmath58 1 mpc ) that the uv flux from the quasar does not dominate the uv background radiation field in the a@xmath42 component .",
    "figure 6 shows the cloudy results for the high ionization species assuming the total neutral hydrogen column density used in figure 4 .",
    "none of the model seds can explain the c iv , n v , si iv , o vi and si iii column densities .",
    "hence the absorption lines for these high ionization species are not coming from the same material as the absorption for the low ionization species .",
    "however , assuming the equilibrium between collisional ionization and radiative and dielectronic recombination , we find that t @xmath59 k can explain the relative ratios of these species ( shull & van steenberg 1982 ) .",
