    "high - energy diffractive processes have been extensively modeled with pomeron(@xmath1 ) exchange .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the @xmath1-proton coupling to a very good approximation is given by the sum of individual @xmath1-quark coupling and that in the two - gluon model of the pomeron the @xmath1-quark coupling is proportional to @xmath0 , similar to that of c=1 isoscalar photon . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the model has a dubious aspect because @xmath0 is odd under charge conjugation , @xmath2 , while the pomeron should be even under @xmath3 . in spite of this ,",
    "the @xmath0-model has been extensively employed  @xcite-@xcite .    in this work",
    ", i use the nonperturbative nature of the multigluon exchange and treat the pomeron as a bound state of the gluons . as a result , a tensorial @xmath4-quark coupling emerges , which has the correct charge - conjugation property .",
    "my study also shed light on why the @xmath0 coupling can be successful inspite of its intrinsic inadequacy .",
    "the doorway model for the @xmath6-channel @xmath7 scattering and the corresponding @xmath8-channel @xmath9 scattering is illustrated in fig.1 , where the doorway - state ( shaded rectangle ) is required to possess the quantum numbers of a pomeron . at small @xmath8 s",
    "the pomeron trajectory is linear : @xmath10 .",
    "the spins of the pomerons are given by @xmath11 = \\alpha_0 + { \\cal r}e[\\alpha']\\ t \\ ,",
    "$ ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13=0.20\\pm 0.02 $ ]  @xcite,@xcite , and 0.25  @xcite .",
    "the spins compatible with the general properties of the pomeron are @xmath14 . for definiteness",
    ", i will discuss the case with @xmath15 .",
    "the inclusion of higher @xmath16 in the theory is straightforward .",
    "it suffices to analyze the lower @xmath17 vertex in fig.1(b ) , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the momenta of the @xmath20 .",
    "the lsz reduction gives the vertex function @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the spin-2 tensor spinor .     or @xmath20 and the pomeron : ( a ) @xmath6-channel @xmath7 scattering ; ( b ) @xmath8-channel @xmath9 scattering.,height=226 ]    since @xmath22 is a symmetric tensor and @xmath23 is scalar , it follows that @xmath24 is a symmetric tensor . the most general expansion of @xmath24 is @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are scalars , @xmath28 a symmetric tensor , @xmath29 and @xmath30 4-vectors , @xmath31 and @xmath32 pseudo 4-vectors , and @xmath33 a pseudo tensor .",
    "only two of the three 4-vectors in eq.([eq:2.4 ] ) are independent . because it is not possible to construct either a pseudoscalar or a pseudovector , or a pseudotensor from two 4-vectors , it follows that @xmath34 and @xmath35  furthermore , since the pomeron has no charge and since @xmath23 is invariant under @xmath3 , it follows that @xmath24 is also invaraint with respect to @xmath3 . because @xmath36 are both odd under @xmath3 ,",
    "hence @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the final result is @xmath39 one can write @xmath40 in the c.m . of the @xmath8-channel , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "thus , @xmath43 , @xmath44 @xmath45    the absence of @xmath0 in eq.([eq:2.7 ] ) is due to the spin-2 tensor spinor of the pomeron which makes @xmath24 invariant under the @xmath3 operation .",
    "one should note that in ref.@xcite no definite spin and parity were projected out from the two - gluon state . as a result ,",
    "the two - gluon model led to a @xmath0 coupling .",
    "in other words , it is the spin - parity of the pomeron that constrains the symmetry property of the vertex .",
    "of course , obtaining a bound state starting with multigluons is still an unsolved nonperturbative dynamics .",
    "our doorway approach represents an alternative solution .",
    "the amplitude is equal to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the spin-2 projector . in the rest frame of the @xmath1 , @xmath48 .",
    "hence , @xmath49 reduces to @xmath50 if @xmath51 , then @xmath52    the effective interaction lagrangian density of the doorway model is @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the mass and the tensor field of the @xmath56 pomeron , @xmath57 the quark field , @xmath58 the gluon field , and @xmath59 the coupling constants .",
    "the color index is omitted but understood .",
    "the gauge invariant gluonic current is @xcite   @xmath60 in the abelian approximation @xmath61 and @xmath62 the leading - order diagrams are shown in fig.2 .",
    "detailed evaluation of these diagrams supports the ansatz @xmath63 that led to eq.([eq:2.14 ] ) .    .",
    "the dashed lines denote the intermediate gluons .",
    "there are two additional diagrams ( not shown ) corresponding , respectively , to having the @xmath64 and @xmath20 lines crossed in the upper vertex of ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    ", height=226 ]    the determination of the tensor - coupling vertex from the @xmath65 scattering data by means of regge theory can be found in ref.@xcite where for the first time a singularity - free , crossing symmetric , invariant form factor has been formulated and applied with success .",
    "the results obtained from fitting @xmath65 total and differential cross sections at @xmath66 between 30 and 60 gev / c with the use of @xmath67 are : @xmath68=0.65 - 0.66 ; @xmath69=1.95 - 1.96 ; @xmath70 ; @xmath71 ( all in gev / c  ) .",
    "( the dimensions and values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 differ from those in @xcite because of using a new parametrization of the amplitude , namely , ( a ) @xmath74 and ( b ) in @xmath75 the factor @xmath76 is absorbed into @xmath77 see eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) of @xcite-1 for the notation . )",
    "the form factor is illustrated in fig.3 .",
    "the spin and parity of the pomeron leads to a @xmath3-invariant tensor - coupling @xmath17 vertex and to a @xmath9 amplitude proportional to @xmath78 , a scalar .",
