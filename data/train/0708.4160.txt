    "the study of @xmath0-symmetric potentials originated in the seminal papers@xcite,@xcite by bender and coworkers , dedicated to the analysis of spectra of non - hermitian hamiltonians of anharmonic oscillators , which turn out to be entirely real on condition that exact @xmath0 symmetry holds , _",
    "i.e. _ , the hamiltonian , @xmath1 , commutes with the @xmath2 operator and all eigenfunctions of @xmath1 are also eigenstates of @xmath0 . in case of exact @xmath0 symmetry , it is possible to formulate an equivalent quantum mechanical description by defining a new metric operator in the representation space , a concept already established@xcite before the study of the properties of @xmath0-symmetric potentials and generalized later to the definition of pseudo - hermitian quantum mechanics@xcite . if the condition that the eigenfunctions of the @xmath0 invariant hamiltonian are also eigenfunctions of @xmath2 is relaxed , the @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken and complex eigenvalues appear in the spectrum of @xmath1 .",
    "since then many authors have examined @xmath3bound state problems with @xmath0-symmetric potentials in non relativistic quantum mechanics , while relatively few studies are dedicated to relativistic models , or even to @xmath2-symmetric quantum field theories@xcite .",
    "the present work intends to be a contribution to the study of the @xmath0 invariant dirac equation , with emphasis on scattering aspects , within the framework of standard relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "@xmath0-symmetric potentials will be treated phenomenologically as effective potentials , without attempting to formulate an equivalent hermitian theory @xcite .",
    "solvable models in the dirac equation are most easily constructed in ( 1 + 1 ) space - time dimensions and the related @xmath0-symmetric potentials may have different behaviour under lorentz transformations , and are classified as vectors , pseudovectors , scalars , or pseudoscalars . in the cases of scalar and pseudoscalar potentials , affecting particles and antiparticles in the same way , the relevant hidden symmetry of the dirac equation can be classified as pseudosupersymmetry@xcite . the analysis of vector potentials has been focused mainly on bound states , like in the generalized hultn potential of ref.@xcite ,  or in the logarithmic derivative of a suitable position - dependent effective mass of ref.@xcite ,  while scattering aspects have not been examined in detail . among the latter ,",
    "an interesting peculiarity of strong potentials , with @xmath4 , the threshold for production of a particle - antiparticle pair , with @xmath5 the particle mass , is the possibility that bound states merge with the negative - energy continuum of scattering states , thus appearing as transmission resonances at negative energies inside the potential well , which becomes overcritical with respect to spontaneous creation of particle - antiparticle pairs .",
    "such overcritical vector potentials are well studied in the hermitian case in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , from the simplest example of the square well@xcite , to the cusp potential@xcite,@xcite , or the woods - saxon potential@xcite . in the present work",
    ", we study scattering aspects of overcritical @xmath0 -symmetric potentials , in particular how overcriticality is interrelated with spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark from the very beginning that our framework is standard quantum mechanics with complex potentials , phenomenologically treated as effective potentials . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "the analysis is carried out in detail for the @xmath0-symmetric square well , taken as the time component of a vector potential .    in this short note",
    ", we shall not enter into discussion of construction of positive definite norms via a linear operator , @xmath6 , commuting with the @xmath0 operator and the hamiltonian , @xmath1 , introduced by bender and collaborators in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics@xcite , bbj04,@xcite and later extended to quantum field theory , in particular @xmath0 -symmetric quantum electrodynamics , with imaginary electric charge and axial vector potential@xcite .",
    "we already know from previous work on bound states in the schrdinger equation that the @xmath0 symmetry of the square well is spontaneously broken  @xcite ,  @xcite and that the perturbative derivation of the @xmath6 operator below the critical value of the imaginary part of the potential is by no means trivial  @xcite .",
    "as far as scattering states are concerned , however , we have pointed out in our previous work on non relativistic scattering  @xcite , that , even in the case of spontaneous breakdown of @xmath0 symmetry , transmission and reflection coefficients for progressive waves , travelling from left to right on the real axis , and for regressive waves , travelling from right to left , have definite non trivial relations , which are not valid for a general complex potential .",
    "these relations are connected with the fact that the imaginary part of a @xmath0-symmetric potential is an odd function of the space coordinate @xmath7 , so that its integral over the @xmath7 axis vanishes .    the present work is thus intended as a phenomenological investigation of relativistic features , such as overcriticality , in presence of a spontaneously broken @xmath0 symmetry , which would hardly emerge for different reasons , either in the case of a general complex potential , or in the case of a potential with exact asymptotic @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "in the present work we assume a @xmath0 -symmetric square well potential    @xmath8    where the real and imaginary depths , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , and the half - width , @xmath11 , are positive numbers , while the elementary charge is assumed to be @xmath12 @xmath13 for particles , as the time component of a vector potential in the dirac equation in @xmath14 dimensions @xmath15    here , the dirac hamiltonian , @xmath16 , reads @xmath17    formula ( [ dirac_eq ] ) is written in natural units , @xmath18 , which will be used throughout the present work , and the metric is @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 @xmath3hermitian matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 anticommute and are traceless with square unity : it is thus possible to identify them with two of the pauli matrices : the choice we make corresponds to the standard dirac representation@xcite@xmath23particularly suited to the study of the nonrelativistic limit of eq .",
