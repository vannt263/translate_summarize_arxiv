    "traditionally , information flow in networked systems was treated like fluid through pipes , and independent information flows were processed separately . under this assumption , for a unicast transmission ( one source node transfers information to one destination node ) , the maximum transmission rate is bounded by the size of the minimum cut between the source and the destination .",
    "this result is known as the _ min - cut max - flow theorem _ , which was proved by menger  @xcite , ford and fulkerson  @xcite and elias  _ et al . _",
    "however , for a multicast transmission ( one source node transfers information to multiple destination nodes ) , this maximum flow rate can not always be achieved by traditional store - and - forward routing algorithms , even if each source - destination pair has the minimum cut with the same size .",
    "that is because in a multicast transmission , some links in the network may be shared by the routing paths for different source - destination pairs .    in their seminal paper",
    "@xcite , ahlswede  _ et al . _ proposed a  _ network coding _",
    "scheme , and showed that if we allow intermediate nodes to encode their received messages and forward the coded messages to their next - hop neighbors , the maximum flow rate can be achieved for mutilcast transmissions .",
    "in addition to the information theoretic treatment of  @xcite , network coding has also been studied in an algebraic framework developed by koetter and mdard in  @xcite , and a combinatorial framework proposed by fragouli and soljanin in  @xcite .",
    "code design for network coding schemes has also attracted intense interest . in  @xcite , li  _ et al .",
    "_ showed that linear codes are sufficient to achieve the maximum flow rate for a one - source multicast transmission .",
    "koetter and mdard , and jaggi  _ et al .",
    "_ constructed linear multicast codes for network coding schemes in  @xcite and in  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the approach of constructing linear codes in a randomized way for multicast transmissions was proposed by ho  _ et al . _ in  @xcite . for a detailed review of network coding and its applications in many fields , e.g. , wireless communication ,",

    "_ studied network coding capacity for weighted random graphs and random geometric graphs . in the random graph model , each pair of nodes are connected by a bidirectional link with probability @xmath0 independently  @xcite .",
    "the capacity of each link is assumed to be i.i.d . according to some probability distribution . in the random geometric graph model",
    ", two nodes are connected to each other by a bidirectional link only when their distance is less than or equal to a predefined positive value @xmath1 , the characteristic radius  @xcite .",
    "each link has a unit capacity .",
    "for these two types of random networks , the authors showed that the network coding capacity is concentrated at the ( weighted ) mean degree of the graph , i.e. , the ( weighted ) mean number of neighbors of each node .",
    "essentially , the results reveal a concentration behavior of the size of the minimum cut between two nodes in random graphs or random geometric graphs .",
    "related problems have been studied in the literature , e.g. , @xcite and references therein . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors studied a generalized random geometric graph model , where two nodes are connected by a bidirectional link with probability 1 if their distance @xmath2 is less than or equal to @xmath3 , and with probability @xmath0 if @xmath4 .",
    "they obtained similar concentration results .",
    "the geometric models in  @xcite assume that a link exists ( possibly with a probability ) between two nodes when the nodes are within each other s transmission range .",
    "although each link has a direction , as all links are bidirectional ( i.e. , the link @xmath5 implies the existence of the link @xmath6 ) , the model in fact leads to an _ undirected _ graph and considerably simplifies the resulting analysis .",
    "in addition , interference among wireless terminals was not considered in  @xcite . nevertheless , in wireless networks , due to noise , interference , and the heterogeneity of transmission powers , significantly more sophisticated models for link connectivity are needed .",
    "for instance , a widely - used model for wireless communication channels is the signal - to - interference - and - noise - ratio ( sinr ) model  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the capacity , i.e. , the size of the minimum cut , of random wireless networks under the sinr model .    given",
    "that network coding capacity with noisy links is in general still an open problem , we assume that as long as the sinr @xmath7 of a link @xmath5 is greater than or equal to a predefined threshold @xmath8 , then node @xmath9 can transmit data at rate @xmath10 packets / sec to node @xmath11 without error . that is , links are noise - free once the sinr condition is met . in other words",
    ", we view network coding as operating on a higher layer in the network communication stack , and assume there is an error correcting code at the lower layer which corrects errors on the links once the sinr threshold is met . given this model , each link is indeed directional , and the capacities of different links are not independent .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that under some mild conditions , the capacity still has a sharp concentration when the scale of the network is large enough .",
    "it is worthy mentioning that the capacity we investigate in this paper is different from the one studied in  @xcite .",
    "the latter is referred to as throughput capacity , or transport capacity , for random wireless networks with many - to - many transmissions . in other words , it is the maximum achievable averaged rate at which each node in the network can transmit ( simultaneously with other nodes specified by scheduling schemes ) to a randomly selected destination node .",
    "in contrast , the network coding capacity that we study in this paper ( as in  @xcite ) is the maximum rate that one source can achieve in a multicast transmission , which is determined by the size of the minimum cut between the source and the destinations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the random wireless network model . in section iii",
    ", we study the network coding capacity for a single source and multiple destinations . specifically , we investigate two cases . in the first case ,",
    "all nodes have the same transmission power , and in the second case , the transmission powers are heterogeneous .",
    "we use different techniques for these two cases and show that the network coding capacity has a concentration behavior in both cases . in section iv , we present relevant simulation results , and finally , we conclude in section v.",
    "we use the following model for random wireless networks . assume    * @xmath12 is a set of @xmath13 nodes which are independently and uniformly distributed at random on the two - dimensional unit torus , where @xmath14 denotes the random location of node @xmath9 , and @xmath13 is the total number of nodes . *",
    "each node @xmath9 has a transmission power @xmath15 , which follows a probability distribution @xmath16 , @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 .    here",
    ", the existence of a link from node @xmath9 to node @xmath11 depends on @xmath11 s ability to decode the transmitted signal from @xmath9 , which is in turn determined by the signal - to - interference - and - noise - ratio ( sinr ) given by @xmath19 where @xmath15 is the transmission power of node @xmath9 , @xmath20 is the distance between nodes @xmath9 and @xmath11 , and @xmath21 is the power of background noise .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is the inverse of the system processing gain .",
    "it is equal to 1 in a narrow - band system and smaller than 1 in a broadband ( e.g. , cdma ) system .",
    "the signal attenuation function @xmath23 is a function of the distance @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the euclidean norm , and is usually given by @xmath26 for some constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    under the sinr model",
    ", the transmitted signal of node @xmath9 can be decoded at @xmath11 if and only if @xmath29 , where @xmath8 is some threshold for decoding . in this case , a link @xmath5 from @xmath9 to @xmath11 is said to exist .",
    "note that even if @xmath30 , @xmath31 may not hold and thus the link @xmath6 may not exist .",

    "another widely used model is the extended network model  @xcite , in which the number of nodes and the area of the region both go to infinity while the ratio between them  the density of the network , is kept constant .",

    "similar results were proved in  @xcite , where the capacities of the links that originate from the same node are i.i.d .",
