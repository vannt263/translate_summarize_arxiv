    "cuspidal automorphic forms on symmetric spaces decay rapidly on siegel sets , a statement that is generally attributed to gelfand and piatetski - shapiro .",
    "this fact was later generalized to so - called @xmath1-finite cuspidal automorphic forms   i.e. , cuspidal automorphic forms on quotients @xmath3 that transform finitely under right translation by a maximal compact subgroup @xmath1 of the ambient reductive group @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the rapid decay is crucially used to prove the analytic continuation and functional equations of @xmath0-functions , by the approach known as  integral representations \" , which goes back to hecke in the case of @xmath5 . in this approach , the @xmath0-function @xmath6 in question",
    "is expressed as an integral of an automorphic form against a suitable integral kernel , depending on the complex variable @xmath7 ; the analytic continuation and functional equation for @xmath6 are then deduced from the corresponding properties of the integral kernel . in a number of cases , the convergence of the integrals depends on the rapid decay on sets larger than siegel sets .",
    "the exterior square @xmath0-function for @xmath2 @xcite is the first instance of this phenomenon ; jacquet - shalika carefully establish the rapid decay on the relevant type of set .",
    "other authors , in later papers , refer to the jacquet - shalika estimate and suggest that similar arguments apply to their cases as well , without supplying any details . in some instances ,",
    "the jacquet - shalika argument does apply , but in others it does not . in any case , we know of no general argument in the literature that treats all these cases by a uniform method .",
    "one purpose of our paper is to provide such a general , uniform statement .",
    "in fact , our results simultaneously handle the convergence of all integral representations of @xmath0-functions that we are aware of .",
    "thus our paper closes a notable gap in the @xmath0-function literature .",
    "one other issue is the class of cuspidal automorphic forms that decay rapidly . for our own work",
    "@xcite we need to know the rapid decay of smooth , but not necessarily @xmath1-finite , automorphic forms .",
    "one can ask for two levels of generality : smooth cuspidal automorphic forms of uniform moderate growth , or even more generally , smooth cuspidal automorphic forms that are not assumed to have uniform moderate growth ; of course they must be required to have moderate growth , as is almost always assumed in the context of automorphic forms    the standard arguments for proving the rapid decay of cusp forms use uniform moderate growth in an essential way . for @xmath1-finite automorphic forms , the distinction between moderate growth and uniform moderate growth disappears , since the former implies the latter quite directly in the @xmath1-finite case .    . the case of uniform moderate growth",
    "is well understood by experts . yet much to our surprise , we were unable to find a clear , simple proof   or even a clear , simple statement   in print .",
    "that is the degree of generality which we need for our own work .",
    "however , it should be of interest that the hypothesis of merely moderate growth suffices . using a result of averbuch @xcite",
    ", we shall show that for smooth cuspidal automorphic forms , moderate growth implies uniform moderate growth , and hence rapid decay .",
    "let us state our results formally .",
    "we suppose that @xmath4 is the group of real points of a reductive algebraic group defined over @xmath8 ; this hypothesis will be relaxed slightly in the main body of the paper .",
    "to simplify our statements , we suppose that @xmath4 has compact center   the general situation can easily be reduced to that case .",
    "we consider a smooth , but not necessarily @xmath1-finite , automorphic form @xmath9 .",
    "we require @xmath9 to have moderate growth , as is customary , but do not expressly assume that @xmath9 has uniform moderate growth .",
    "we fix a linear norm @xmath10 on @xmath4 , i.e. , the operator norm with respect to a faithful finite dimensional representation of @xmath4 ; the particular choice of the norm does not matter .",
    "we choose @xmath11 , the identity component of a maximal diagonalizable @xmath8-split subgroup . by a siegel set @xmath12 , we mean one defined in terms of @xmath13 and some maximal compact subgroup @xmath14 as in @xcite , for example .",
    "* theorem a.  * if the automorphic form @xmath9 is cuspidal , then for every siegel set @xmath15 and every @xmath16 , there exists a positive constant @xmath17 such that @xmath18    in the context of @xmath1-finite automorphic forms , this is the traditional way of stating the rapid decay of cusp forms .",
    "siegel sets are well adapted to the analysis of @xmath1-finite cusp forms , but less so to the setting of merely smooth cuspidal automorphic forms .",
    "our next statement , without reference to siegel sets , formally implies theorem a ; conversely , it follows from the proof   but not the statement   of theorem a. we choose a minimal @xmath8-parabolic subgroup @xmath19 which contains the group @xmath13 , with langlands - levi decomposition @xmath20 thus @xmath21 is maximal among reductive @xmath8-subgroups commuting with @xmath13 ; @xmath22 is then necessarily anisotropic over @xmath23 .",
    "* theorem b.  * if the automorphic form @xmath9 is cuspidal , then for every compact subset @xmath24 and every @xmath16 , there exists a positive constant @xmath17 such that @xmath25    the next result involves a @xmath8-parabolic subgroup @xmath26 which contains @xmath27 , with langlands - levi decomposition @xmath28 adapted to that of @xmath27   in other words , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 . we should mention that any @xmath8-parabolic subgroup of @xmath4 is conjugate , over @xmath23 , to one of this type .",
    "* theorem c.  * if the automorphic form @xmath9 is cuspidal , then for every compact subset @xmath24 and every @xmath16 , there exists a positive constant @xmath17 such that @xmath32    in section [ sec : unipotent ] we give a typical example of an application of this result , an example to which theorems a or b are not directly applicable .",
    "some applications of theorem c can also be deduced from :    * theorem d.  * let @xmath33 denote the modular function for the quotient @xmath34 .",
    "if the automorphic form @xmath9 is cuspidal , then for every compact subset @xmath24 and every @xmath16 , there exists a positive constant @xmath17 such that @xmath35    in the @xmath1-finite context , for maximal parabolic subgroups @xmath26 , this bound is stated in @xcite , but used only in the case of @xmath36 . for the proof , friedberg - jacquet refer the reader to @xcite , which establishes the bound for maximal parabolic subgroups of @xmath37 , but not for maximal parabolic subgroups of a general group @xmath4 .",
    "both theorems c and d contain theorem b as a special instance , in the case of theorem c with @xmath38 , and in the case of theorem d with @xmath39 ; see remark [ rem : decay3 ] . for some applications of the theorems ,",
    "it is necessary to understand how the bounding constants @xmath17 in the four theorems depend on the automorphic form @xmath9 .",
    "the precise description of the dependence , which involves representation theoretic notions , will be given in the main body of this paper .",
    "theorem a , for @xmath1-finite automorphic forms , is often stated without the hypothesis of cuspidality , though bounding not @xmath9 itself , but rather the difference between @xmath9 and a finite linear combination of constant terms along various cusps ; see @xcite , for example .",
    "that type of argument applies quite directly in the smooth case , assuming uniform moderate growth .",
    "theorems b , c , and d are deduced from theorem a using reduction theory , so analogues of these for noncuspidal forms for smooth automorphic forms of uniform moderate growth can be deduced in a straightforward way .",
    "the estimates we prove in this paper are phrased in classical terms .",
    "however , they apply directly to adelic automorphic forms using the translation between adelic and classical siegel domains described in @xcite . as borel",
    "@xcite has pointed out , the situation is in fact simpler in the adelic setting because there is only a single adelic cusp .",
    "alternatively one can exhibit the action of the adeles in terms of the automorphic distributions we study ; see @xcite .",
    "from that point of view , the automorphic distribution itself is the adelic object , and the results in sections [ sec : rapiddecay ] - [ sec : maintheorems ] below provide all the decay estimates we need .",
    "we conclude this introduction with a flow chart for our paper .",
    "we recall the notion of an automorphic distribution and its connection to automorphic forms in section [ sec : rapiddecay ] , which ends with the statement of two results : theorem [ thm : uniformlymg ] asserts that in the context of smooth cuspidal automorphic forms , moderate growth ensures uniform moderate growth ; theorem [ thm : decay1 ] states the rapid decay on siegel sets for automorphic forms arising from cuspidal automorphic distributions .",
    "the former also implies that all smooth cuspidal automorphic forms do arise from cuspidal automorphic distributions .",
    "theorem a follows from these two theorems , taken together . in section",
    "[ sec : maintheorems ] we state versions of theorems b  d in terms of cuspidal automorphic distributions , and deduce those versions from theorem [ thm : decay1 ] .",
    "as in the case of theorem a , theorems b  d follow from the corresponding statements in terms of automorphic distributions",
    ". section [ sec : unipotent ] describes the application of theorem c to rankin - selberg type integrals which involve unipotent integrations , and contains a typical example .",
    "the proofs of theorem [ thm : decay1 ] and theorem [ thm : uniformlymg ] occupy , respectively , sections [ sec : proofmainthm ] and [ sec : uniform ] .",
    "the appendix explains certain technical details which are well known to representation theorists , but have not been concisely described elsewhere .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge helpful discussions with bill casselman , solomon friedberg , howard garland , david ginzburg , herv jacquet , gregory margulis , zeev rudnick , david soudry , nolan wallach , and also with joseph hundley , who read our manuscript carefully .",
    "we start with a reductive linear group defined over @xmath8 , realized as subgroup of @xmath40 for some @xmath41 , compatibly with the @xmath8-structure determined by @xmath42 .",
    "we let @xmath4 denote a finite cover , typically but not always the trivial cover , of the group of real points in that reductive linear group . following common practice",
    ", we call a subgroup @xmath43 _ arithmetic _ if it is commensurate with a stabilizer of a lattice in @xmath44 ,  a lattice whose @xmath8-linear span is @xmath45 . with slight abuse of terminology",
    ", we call @xmath46 _ rational _ if it preserves @xmath42 , and @xmath47 denotes the group of all such rational @xmath48",
    ". we shall say that a subgroup of @xmath4 is  defined over @xmath8 \" if it is the inverse image , in @xmath4 , of the group of real points of a @xmath8-subgroup of the original linear group .",
    "analogously we shall call a homomorphism @xmath49 , from @xmath4 to the group @xmath50 of real points in some other @xmath8-group ,  defined over @xmath8 \" if it drops to a homomorphism from the linear quotient of @xmath4 to @xmath50 , and is defined over @xmath8 on that level .    going to a further finite cover , if necessary",
    ", one can express @xmath4 as the direct product of a maximal central , connected , @xmath8-split subgroup and a reductive group whose center is compact and which satisfies the original hypotheses ; see , for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 10.7 ) .",
    "this allows us to impose the following standing assumption , without loss of generality : @xmath51 indeed , any automorphic form on which the center of @xmath4 acts according to a character is completely determined by its restriction to the derived group @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "assertions about the rapid decay do not really involve the center .",
    "thus ( [ cptctr ] ) is not a restrictive assumption , but simplifies various definitions and statements below .",
    "we pick a minimal one among the parabolic subgroups , defined over @xmath8 , of the original reductive linear group , and let @xmath27 denote the corresponding subgroup of @xmath4 .",
    "it is unique up to conjugation by some @xmath53 , and @xmath54 here  connected \" means connected in the hausdorff topology .",
    "since we allow finite covers of algebraic groups , we deviate slightly from borel s conventions in @xcite , which would let @xmath13 denote the zariski closure of what we denote by @xmath13 . in the case of @xmath55 , for example , equipped with the standard @xmath56-structure , the upper triangular subgroup can play the role of @xmath27 ; for borel , @xmath22 reduces to the identity and @xmath13 is the entire diagonal subgroup , whereas for us @xmath57 and @xmath13 is the subgroup of diagonal matrices with positive diagonal entries .    once and for all we choose a maximal compact subgroup @xmath58 , whose lie algebra is perpendicular to the lie algebra of @xmath13 , perpendicular relative to the trace form of the tautological representation of @xmath59 on @xmath60   recall that @xmath4 finitely covers a subgroup of @xmath59 , so the lie algebra of @xmath59 contains that of @xmath4 .",
    "the assumption ( [ cptctr ] ) implies @xmath61 , of course .    with our conventions , passing to a finite cover of @xmath4",
    "only affects @xmath22 ; both @xmath13 and @xmath41 remain connected , @xmath41 is still an algebraic group , and @xmath22 a finite cover of an algebraic group .",
    "the lie algebras of these groups will be referred to by the corresponding lower case german letters .",
    "a restricted root is a non - zero element @xmath62 such that the @xmath63-_root space _",
    "@xmath64 = \\langle \\alpha , h \\rangle",
    "x\\ \\text{for all $ h \\in { \\mathfrak a}$\\ , } \\}\\ ] ] is non - zero .",
    "then @xmath65 the set of rational roots , is an abstract root system , not necessarily reduced @xcite .",
    "it contains @xmath66 as a positive root system  in particular , @xmath67 , as disjoint union .",
    "every @xmath68 lifts to a character @xmath69 and in fact to an algebraic character of the zariski closure of @xmath13 .",
    "equivalently , one may view @xmath70 as an algebraic character of @xmath71 , which is identically equal to 1 on the identity component of @xmath22 ( identity component in the zariski sense ) , but may take the value @xmath72 on some of the other components of @xmath22 .",
    "statements about the decay of cusp forms on symmetric spaces are traditionally stated in terms of siegel sets , which are inverse images , under the projection @xmath73 , of approximate fundamental domains of the action of @xmath74 on @xmath75 . in dealing with smooth , but not necessarily @xmath1-finite functions on @xmath4 , growth estimates are relatively insensitive to right translation by arbitrary compact subsets of @xmath4 , not just @xmath1 itself .",
    "for that reason it is convenient to introduce the notion of a _ generalized siegel set _ :  a set @xmath76 of the form @xmath77 this reduces to the usual notion of siegel set in the special case when @xmath78 .",
    "we do not mean to suggest that generalized siegel sets @xmath79 have what borel @xcite calls the  siegel property \" , i.e. , the finiteness of the set of @xmath80 such that @xmath81  typically they do not .",
    "siegel sets in the usual sense do have this property , of course . for us , in the setting of smooth , but not necessarily @xmath1-finite , automorphic forms , the notion of generalized siegel set has significant technical advantages . in any case ,",
    "our results below , on the rapid decay of cuspidal automorphic forms on generalized siegel sets , evidently imply rapid decay on siegel sets in the usual sense .",
    "siegel sets @xmath82 in the usual sense have finite haar measure , and there exists a finite subset @xmath83 such that @xmath84 specifically , as @xmath85 one can take a complete set of representatives for the set of cusps , i.e. , the double coset space @xmath86 @xcite",
    ". thus all bounded functions @xmath87 are integrable over @xmath3 , in particular all functions @xmath87 that decay rapidly on any generalized siegel set .    because of the assumptions on @xmath4 , there exists a finite dimensional representation @xmath88 whose kernel is finite .",
    "for @xmath89 we define @xmath90 the subgroup @xmath13 acts , via @xmath91 , in a diagonalizable fashion , with positive real diagonal matrix entries .",
    "thus , for every @xmath92 , the norm @xmath93 and the largest eigenvalue of @xmath94 are mutually bounded .",
    "recall that a function @xmath95 is said to have _ moderate growth _ if @xmath96 , with @xmath97 , has moderate growth , with the same index of growth @xmath41 as @xmath9 itself . here",
    "@xmath98 denotes the action , by infinitesimal right translation , of the universal enveloping algebra @xmath99 of the complexification @xmath100 of @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath102 be an admissible representation of @xmath4 , of finite length , on a reflexive banach space    we shall recall the definitions of admissibility and finite length in section [ sec : proofmainthm ] , and the relevance of reflexivity in the appendix .    .",
    "the action @xmath103 of @xmath4 on the banach space @xmath104 restricts to a representation on the space of @xmath105 vectors @xmath106 it is dense in @xmath104 and carries a natural topology , the topology which @xmath107 inherits from its inclusion in the space of @xmath105 @xmath104-valued functions on @xmath4 via ( [ vinfinity ] ) . the action of @xmath4 on @xmath107 is continuous with respect to this @xmath105 topology .",
    "we let @xmath108 denote the banach dual of @xmath102 , which is again an admissible representation of finite length .",
    "thus it makes sense to define the space of distribution vectors for @xmath104 as @xmath109 the continuous dual of the space of @xmath105 vectors @xmath110 for @xmath108 . as follows formally from the definition , @xmath111 in analogy to the containments @xmath112 for a compact manifold @xmath113 . by duality , @xmath4 acts on @xmath114",
    "this action becomes continuous when one equips @xmath114 with the strong dual topology , which turns @xmath114 into a complete , locally convex , hausdorff topological vector space    for a discussion of the topology on @xmath115 and of the strong continuity of the action of @xmath4 on @xmath115 see the appendix .    .",
    "as a general fact @xcite , for any choice of @xmath116 and @xmath117 , the complex valued function @xmath118 is smooth , of uniform moderate growth   see ( [ infty5a ] ) below   and transforms finitely under @xmath119 , the center of the universal enveloping algebra @xmath99 .",
    "we now fix an arithmetic subgroup @xmath43 . in the preceding definition , if @xmath120 , i.e. , if @xmath117 is @xmath121-invariant , the function ( [ autodist-1 ] ) is left @xmath121-invariant .",

    "an _ automorphic representation _ consists of an irreducible unitary representation @xmath102 of @xmath4 , together with a @xmath4-invariant isometric embedding @xmath125 if @xmath116 is a @xmath105 vector , then @xmath126 is a @xmath121-invariant @xmath105 function on @xmath4 .",

    "indeed , the hecke algebra acts on the left , and therefore commutes with the action of any left invariant differential operator . according to averbuch , applying such a differential operator does not affect the order of growth .",
    "let us suppose now that @xmath585 satisfies ( [ uniform1 ] ) , and in addition the cuspidality condition @xmath586 because of proposition [ prop : uniform ] , the first assertion of theorem [ thm : uniformlymg ] reduces to :    [ lem : uniform ] under the hypotheses just stated , @xmath9 is hecke finite .",
    "we choose @xmath587 as in ( [ uniform1]a ) .",

    "we let @xmath592 denote the vector space of all functions @xmath593 which are square integrable with respect to @xmath589 , and are cuspidal in the sense of ( [ uniform2 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath594 , the completion of @xmath595 in the @xmath596-norm , is a hilbert space on which @xmath438 acts by right translation , in a continuous manner .",

    "all the @xmath599 are locally @xmath600 as functions on @xmath4 , and thus can be regarded as distributions .",
    "they inherit the finiteness condition ( [ uniform1]b ) from @xmath601 : @xmath602 the equality @xmath603 is to be interpreted in the sense of distributions , of course .",
    "the ideal @xmath604 contains monic polynomials in the casimir operator @xmath605 , and @xmath605 is elliptic transversally to @xmath606 .",

    "each @xmath610 is the image of a @xmath1-invariant projection operator @xmath615 , given by right convolution , under @xmath1 , against the complex conjugate of the character of @xmath612 , suitably renormalized . in particular @xmath616",

    "only finitely many irreducible harish chandra modules are annihilated by the ideal @xmath623 , and every irreducible harish chandra module has finite @xmath607-multiplicities .",
    "it follows that @xmath624 is finite dimensional , hence @xmath625 as consequence of ( [ app6b ] ) .",
    "moreover , all the @xmath610 , @xmath611 , lie in a finite direct sum of cuspidal automorphic representations .",
    "recall the definition ( [ admiss1 ] ) of an admissible representation .",
    "because of what we have just established , the @xmath506-module @xmath626 has finite @xmath1-multiplicities , so @xmath627 is indeed admissible . but",

    "@xmath627 must therefore have finite length and be completely reducible . to summarize , @xmath628 appealing once more to ( [ kfinite ] )",
    ", we now find that @xmath9 lies in the @xmath596-closure of @xmath626 , and therefore in the @xmath596-closure of the linear span of the finitely many irreducible summands of the cuspidal spectrum which are annihilated by @xmath629 .",
    "the hecke action commutes with the action of @xmath629 , and hence the summands can be chosen so that the hecke algebra acts on each of them by a character .",
    "the assertion of the lemma now follows , because the hecke action is continuous with respect to the @xmath596-norm .    to complete the proof of theorem [ thm : uniformlymg ] , we must show that any @xmath9 satisfying the hypotheses stated at the beginning of this section is a sum of @xmath105 vectors in finitely many closed @xmath4-invariant , @xmath4-irreducible subspaces of @xmath124   see remark [ ftaujv ] .    at this point , as consequence of proposition",
    "[ prop : uniform ] and lemma [ lem : uniform ] , we know that @xmath9 has uniform moderate growth .",
    "thus we can apply the usual proof of the rapid decay of cusp forms , as sketched in section [ sec : proofmainthm ] , to conclude that @xmath9 decays rapidly on siegel sets ; not only @xmath9 , in fact , but also all its derivatives @xmath630 with @xmath97 , since these satisfy the same hypotheses as @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , @xmath631 this means that @xmath632 is a @xmath105 function on @xmath4 , with values in the hilbert space @xmath124 .",
    "we can now argue as in the proof of lemma [ lem : uniform ] , using haar measure @xmath591 instead of @xmath589 .",
    "the space @xmath633 , which contains @xmath9 , is then a closed subspace of @xmath124 .",
    "the assertion ( [ uniform3 ] ) , in the present context , means that @xmath634 is a finite direct sum of closed @xmath4-invariant , @xmath4-irreducible subspaces @xmath635 .",
    "the orthogonal projections @xmath636 are bounded linear maps , and composing the @xmath105 function @xmath632 with these projections results in @xmath105 @xmath637-valued functions   in words , in @xmath105 vectors @xmath638 .",
    "but then @xmath639 , which is the conclusion we need .",
    "the integral ( [ cuspidal2 ] ) makes sense because @xmath114 is a complete , locally convex , hausdorff topological vector space , on which @xmath4 acts in a strongly continuous manner .",
    "these facts are well known to experts , but it seems no concise reference exists .",
    "we shall briefly sketch the relevant arguments in this appendix .    recall the notion of _ continuity _ of a representation @xmath102 on a complete , locally convex , hausdorff topological vector space :",
    "the action map from @xmath640 to @xmath104 , @xmath641 , is continuous , relative to the product topology on the domain . _",
    "strong continuity _",
    ", on the other hand , only requires the continuity of the functions @xmath642 for all @xmath643 .",
    "the terminology notwithstanding ,  continuity \" thus is a more restrictive notion than  strong continuity \" .",
    "the uniform boundedness principle ensures that the two definitions coincide for banach spaces .",
    "if @xmath104 is a banach space , one can argue directly from the definition that the action of @xmath4 on @xmath527 , the space of smooth @xmath104-valued functions , is continuous . via the assignment @xmath644 ,",
    "@xmath645 , @xmath107 maps into @xmath527 .",
    "thus , if @xmath102 is a continuous representation on a banach space , the representation @xmath646 on the space of @xmath105 vectors inherits the continuity from @xmath527 , which contains @xmath107 as a closed subspace .    still in the setting of a banach representation @xmath102 ,",
    "the continuity of the induced representation @xmath647 on the space of distribution vectors is a more subtle matter . by definition , @xmath114 is the space of continuous linear functionals on @xmath110 , the space of @xmath105 vectors for the dual representation @xmath108 on the banach dual @xmath123 .",
    "but the continuity of @xmath103 implies the strong continuity of the dual representation @xmath648 only if banach space @xmath104 is reflexive ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , proposition 4.2.2.1 ) . only in that case",
    "is the continuity of @xmath649 assured , and therefore only in that case does it make sense to consider the representation @xmath647 on the space of distribution vectors @xmath114 .",
    "let us suppose then that @xmath104 is a reflexive banach space , or more specifically a hilbert space as in ( [ autorep ] ) .",
    "we apply ( [ norm0 ] ) to @xmath123 and let @xmath650 denote the completion of @xmath651 with respect to the norm @xmath535 . in analogy to @xmath107 ,  @xmath650 can be topologically embedded into @xmath652 as a closed subspace .",
    "that implies the continuity of @xmath653 , which alternatively can be deduced directly from ( [ norm0 ] ) .",
    "these arguments also topologically identify @xmath110 with the projective limit ( * ? ? ? *",
    "50 - 7 ) of the @xmath653 , @xmath654 dually , we equip @xmath114 with the inductive limit topology @xmath655 for the sequence of banach duals @xmath656 , i.e. , the strongest locally convex topology that makes the inclusions @xmath657 continuous .",
    "these inclusions are then topological isomorphisms onto their images , and @xmath114 is the union of the @xmath656 ; see , for example , chapters 13 and 50 - 7 in @xcite .",

    "thus the strong continuity of the @xmath653 implies the strong continuity of the @xmath658 , and hence the strong continuity of @xmath647 . with more effort one can prove that @xmath647 is even continuous , but strong continuity is enough for our purposes since it gives meaning to the integral in ( [ cuspidal2 ] )"
