    "with the continuing developments in materials science and engineering , a renewed interest has emerged in understanding the temperature - dependent magnetic properties pertaining to real materials .",
    "this demands sophisticated and improved magnetic models that are capable of providing a more realistic depiction of the material than that is possible with conventional spin models .",
    "a  novel class of such improved models that continues to gain widespread attention are atomistic models that treat the dynamics of the translational ( atomic ) degrees of freedom on an equal footing with the spin ( magnetic ) degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "we will refer to such models as ( coupled , dynamical ) spin  lattice models .",
    "the motivation for these hybrid models is the substantial amount of experimental and theoretical evidence that suggests strong phonon ",
    "magnon coupling in magnetic crystals , particularly in transition metals and alloys  @xcite .",
    "a  parameterized spin  lattice model for bcc iron developed by ma _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite has been subjected to a number of subsequent studies targeted towards understanding the dynamical behavior , including vacancy formation and migration  @xcite , and phonon  magnon interactions  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the model has been recently extended by incorporating spin - orbit interactions  @xcite , which , in particular , extends its applicability to accurate modeling of non - equilibrium dynamical processes .",
    "previous work on coupled spin ",
    "lattice systems was almost exclusively performed using the combined molecular and spin dynamics technique  @xcite , in which the coupled equations of motion for all degrees of freedom are simultaneously solved to obtain phase - space trajectories in real time .",
    "a single study has been reported where parallel tempering monte carlo ( mc ) method was applied to relatively small system sizes to investigate the magnetic phase transition in iron  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the obvious inflation of the phase space due to the inclusion of the extra spatial degrees of freedom , the coupling between the spin and lattice subsystems may also pose a significant challenge for the sampling due to the emergence of novel excitations such as coupled phonon ",
    "magnon modes  @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of reasonably large systems without compromising the accuracy and efficiency requires state - of - the - art mc methods that effectively utilize modern computing resources .    among numerous mc methods introduced in the past few decades ,",
    "landau sampling  @xcite stands out as a powerful , yet a simple technique with only a few adjustable parameters . unlike canonical mc methods in which the goal is to generate a sequence of microstates from the canonical ensemble at a given temperature @xmath0 , the wang ",
    "landau method strives to deliver an estimate of the density of states @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the energy , as the end product .",
    "in essence , this is accomplished by , ideally , performing a random walk in energy space while iteratively adjusting the density of states .",
    "the estimated density of states can then be used to extract thermodynamic properties for the entire temperature range of interest .",
    "an inherent advantage of wang ",
    "landau sampling is its ability to easily overcome free energy barriers .",
    "thus the method has been frequently applied for systems with rough free energy landscapes such as spin glasses , liquid crystals , polymers and proteins etc .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the recently introduced replica - exchange wang ",
    "landau ( rewl ) framework  @xcite further pushes the limits of wang ",
    "landau sampling by directly exploiting the power of the modern parallel computing systems . in this approach",
    ", the total energy range is divided into a set of overlapping windows that are concurrently sampled by independent random walkers . adopting the concept of conformational swapping from parallel tempering  @xcite , occasional configurational ( replica ) exchanges between overlapping windows",
    "are allowed , facilitating each replica to traverse through the entire energy range .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the feasibility and the efficacy of using the rewl method for coupled spin ",
    "lattice systems that are specifically parameterized for bcc iron . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model_and_methods ] , we describe the system hamiltonian and the parameterization that we adopt , and provide a detailed description of the rewl method . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present our results and analysis , with emphasis on exploring the impact of the phonons on the magnetic phase transition , as well as the sensitivity of the results to different interatomic potentials .",
    "[ sec : model_and_methods ]      [ sec : model ]    let us consider a classical system of @xmath3 magnetic atoms of mass @xmath4 , described by their positions @xmath5 and the orientations @xmath6 of the atomic spins .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the spin - independent ( non - magnetic ) scalar interaction between the atoms , and the heisenberg - like interaction with the coordinate - dependent exchange parameter @xmath9 specifies the exchange coupling between the spins .    since the theoretical framework for interaction potentials that specifically exclude magnetic contributions is not yet available ,",
    "we construct @xmath8 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents a conventional interatomic potential for bcc iron based on the embedded atom model ( eam ) , and @xmath12 is the energy contribution from a collinear spin state which we subtract to eliminate the magnetic interaction energy implicitly contained in @xmath13 . with the chosen form of @xmath8 ,",
    "the hamiltonian   provides the same energy as @xmath13 for the ferromagnetic ground state at @xmath14k .    for @xmath13 , we choose two well - established eam potentials for bcc iron , namely , the finnis  sinclair potential  @xcite , and the dudarev  derlet `` magnetic '' potential  @xcite . introduced in 1984 , the finnis  sinclair ( fs ) model is one of the oldest and most frequently used many - body potentials for bcc iron .",
    "the theoretical foundation of the fs potential is based on a second - moment approximation to the tight binding density of states . despite its simple empirical form and the short cut - off distance",
    ", the fs potential can reproduce bulk material properties , such as bulk moduli and elastic constants , reasonably accurately  @xcite .",
    "hence , it has long been a popular choice among materials scientists . however , it is not suitable for modeling highly disordered systems such as interstitial and vacancy configurations since the repulsive part of the potential is too `` soft , '' and thus tends to produce nonphysical results for such systems  @xcite .    among various empirical potentials derived for bcc iron , the recently introduced dudarev ",
    "derlet ( dd ) potential stands out due to its unique feature of taking the local magnetic structure into account when determining the interatomic forces .",
    "the dd potential is based upon the stoner and the ginzburg ",
    "landau models and is motivated by the fact that the presence of magnetism significantly contributes to the stability of the crystal structure in iron - based materials  @xcite .",
    "it was then parameterized using a wide range of material properties , including bulk cohesive energy , lattice constants , elastic constants , and vacancy formation energies corresponding to both bcc and fcc configurations , as well as magnetic and non - magnetic phases  @xcite .",
    "the dd potential does not treat the orientational dynamics of the atomic moments , and therefore , the treatment of non - collinear spin configurations at finite temperatures is outside its domain of applicability . to achieve this",
    ", one needs to incorporate the dynamics of the spin orientations explicitly  @xcite .",
    "for modeling the exchange interaction @xmath15 , we use a simple pairwise function parameterized by first - principles calculations  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18ev , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the heaviside step function .",
    "[ sec : method ]    the foundation for the wang ",
    "landau approach is to recognize that the canonical partition function for a system with discrete energy levels can be written as a summation over all energies in the form @xmath21 where @xmath1 is the density of states . if @xmath1 is known , the problem is essentially solved since one can directly estimate the ensemble average of any thermodynamic function of @xmath2 as @xmath22    the goal of wang ",
    "landau sampling is to iteratively improve the estimate of @xmath1 in a controlled fashion , while performing a guided walk in energy space that eventually leads to the accumulation of a uniform energy histogram as the estimate of @xmath1 converges to its true value .      at the beginning of the wang ",

    "is assigned for all energies .",
    "then , starting from an arbitrary initial state of the system , a random walk in the configurational space is performed by sequentially generating trial states . during each mc step , a new trial state @xmath26 is generated by applying an mc trial move on the current state @xmath27 .",

    "the random walk is continued until all energy bins have been visited sufficiently often .",
    "different ways of checking this condition have been proposed  @xcite . in the conventional version",
    ", one could maintain a histogram @xmath34 of the visited energies .",
    "when all the entries in the histogram are greater than a certain percentage of the average histogram value , the histogram is considered to be `` flat '' . at this point ,",
    "the modification factor is reduced , for example by @xmath35 , the histogram is reset to zero , and another iteration of the random walk is initiated .",
    "this process is repeated until the modification factor @xmath31 reaches a predefined terminal value , say @xmath36 .      in rewl sampling , the global energy range @xmath37 $ ] is divided into @xmath38 smaller windows , each of which overlaps with its nearest neighbors on both sides with an overlap ratio @xmath39 ( a schematic diagram is shown in fig .

    "the introduction of lattice vibrations further pushes the peak position to higher temperatures by several degrees .",
    "moreover , lattice vibrations reduces the amplitude of the peak , an effect which is more pronounced for the case of the dd potential .",
    "specific heat data for the simple cubic heisenberg ferromagnet  @xcite has shown that the location of the specific heat peak increases as @xmath92 .",
    "hence , extrapolation of our data to infinite size would change the result very little , as also indicated by exemplary simulations at other system sizes .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed highly parallel replica - exchange wang ",
    "landau simulations to investigate the magnetic phase transition in a coupled spin  lattice model parameterized for bcc iron .",
    "the high level of precision achieved in our simulations has allowed us to make careful comparisons between the results obtained for two different interatomic potentials ( fs and dd ) , and simulations performed on rigid lattices .",
    "such a comprehensive analysis was only possible due to the significant speedup rendered by the parallel , replica - exchange scheme , without any loss of accuracy or precision .",
    "while the complete analysis presented in this paper would take of the order of @xmath93 years for the serial wang ",
    "landau method performed on a single core processor , we obtained all the results within a few months using the parallel scheme .",
    "our results indicate that the presence of lattice vibrations only marginally effects the transition temperature and the amplitude of the peak in the specific heat curve .",
    "this suggests that the classical heisenberg model already provides a reasonable depiction of the magnetic phase transition in bcc iron .",
    "we also find that the results are sensitive to the particular choice of the interatomic potential , particularly at temperatures further away from the critical temperature @xmath94 .",
    "as the temperature increases beyond @xmath94 , the specific heat obtained using the fs potential gradually deviates from that of the rigid lattice simulations , whereas below @xmath94 , a reasonable agreement with the rigid lattice results can be observed . in contrast , the specific heat obtained using the dd potential is higher than that of the rigid lattice simulations up to about @xmath95k , then remains smaller in comparison to the rigid lattice results until about @xmath96k , and thereafter starts to gradually converge with the rigid lattice results .",
    "the differences in the results for the two eam potentials can be attributed to the subtle differences in the ways which the anharmonic effects are captured in these potentials which , in turn , effect the magnetic properties of the system via spin - lattice coupling .",
