    "to understand color confinement is one of the most difficult problems remaining in particle physics @xcite .",
    "as the regge trajectories and lattice qcd indicate , quark confinement is characterized by _ one - dimensional squeezing _ of the color - electric flux with the string tension @xmath4 . on the confinement mechanism ,",
    "nambu proposed the _ dual superconductor theory _ in 1974 , based on the electro - magnetic duality @xcite . in this theory",
    ", there occurs the one - dimensional squeezing of the color - electric flux by the _ dual meissner effect _ due to condensation of bosonic color - magnetic monopoles .",
    "but , there are _ two large gaps _ between qcd and the dual superconductor theory .    1 .",
    "the dual superconductor theory is based on the abelian gauge theory subject to the maxwell - type equations , where electro - magnetic duality is manifest , while qcd is a nonabelian gauge theory .",
    "2 .   the dual superconductor theory requires color - magnetic monopole condensation as the key concept , while qcd itself does not have color - magnetic monopoles .",
    "these gaps may be filled simultaneously by taking _ maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge fixing , _ which reduces qcd to an abelian gauge theory including color - magnetic monopoles @xcite .    in euclidean qcd ,",
    "the ma gauge is defined so as to minimize the  total amount \" of the off - diagonal gluon amplitude @xcite , @xmath5 \\equiv \\int d^4x \\ { \\rm tr }",
    "\\left\\ {   [ \\hat d_\\mu , \\vec h][\\hat d_\\mu , \\vec h]^\\dagger   \\right\\ }   \\vspace{-0.3cm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by the su(@xmath6 ) gauge transformation .",
    "since the @xmath7 covariant derivative @xmath8 obeys the adjoint gauge transformation , the local form of the ma gauge condition is easily derived as @xmath9]=0 .",
    "$ ]    in the ma gauge , the nonabelian gauge symmetry is partially fixed as @xmath10 and qcd reduces into an abelian gauge theory , where the off - diagonal gluons behave as charged matter fields providing the color - electric current in terms of the residual abelian gauge symmetry . in the ma gauge , according to the reduction of the nonabelian gauge manifold , color - magnetic monopoles appear as the topological defects reflecting the nontrivial homotopy group @xmath11 as t  hooft @xcite pointed out with the similar logic on the t  hooft - polyakov monopole .    thus , in the ma gauge , _ qcd reduces into an abelian gauge theory including color - magnetic monopoles , _ and this situation is conjectured to provide a realistic dual - superconductor picture for the confinement mechanism based on qcd , which we call here the nambu-t  hooft picture .",
    "to find out essence of the ma gauge on abelianization , we study the off - diagonal gluon field @xmath12 in the ma gauge in su(2 ) lattice qcd , and find the two remarkable features as follows @xcite .    1 .   the off - diagonal gluon amplitude @xmath13 is strongly suppressed by su(@xmath6 ) gauge transformation in the ma gauge .",
    "2 .   the off - diagonal gluon phase @xmath14 tends to be random , because @xmath14 is not constrained by ma gauge fixing at all , and only the constraint from the qcd action is weak due to a small accompanying factor @xmath15 .",
    "owing to the strong randomness of the off - diagonal gluon phase , we expect strong cancellation of the off - diagonal gluon contribution in the ma gauge , especially for the infrared quantities .",
    "for instance , within the random - variable approximation for the off - diagonal gluon phase @xmath16 in the ma gauge , we analytically derive _ perfect abelian dominance of the string tension , _",
    "@xmath17 , via the _ perimeter law _ of the off - diagonal gluon contribution in the wilson loop  as @xmath18\\rangle}/ { \\langle w_c[a_\\mu^\\pm \\equiv 0 , a_\\mu^3]\\rangle_{\\rm ma } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\simeq & \\exp\\{-l a^2 \\langle |ea_\\mu^\\pm|^2 \\rangle_{\\rm ma}/4\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19\\rangle   $ ] denotes the su(2 ) wilson loop , and @xmath20\\rangle_{\\rm ma } $ ] the _ abelian wilson loop _ in the ma gauge .",
    "we check this relation between the _ macroscopic _ quantity @xmath21 and the _ microscopic _ quantity @xmath22 in lattice qcd @xcite .    as another physical implication",
    ", _ strong randomness of off - diagonal gluon phases _ in the ma gauge leads to _ rapid reduction of off - diagonal gluon correlations _ @xcite as @xmath23 which physically indicates a large effective mass of the off - diagonal gluon in the ma gauge .",
    "we study the euclidean gluon propagator in the ma gauge @xcite using su(@xmath6 ) lattice qcd with @xmath24 . on the residual abelian gauge symmetry ,",
    "we take the abelian landau gauge , where the gluon configuration becomes maximally continuous under the ma gauge constraint .",
    "we show the scalar - type gluon propagators @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) as the function of the four - dimensional euclidean distance @xmath27 in figs.1 and 2 . both in su(2 ) and su(3 ) qcd , we find _ infrared abelian dominance for the gluon propagator in the ma gauge _ : while the diagonal gluon , @xmath28 or @xmath29 , propagates over the long distance , off - diagonal gluons propagate only within a short distance .    next , we evaluate the effective off - diagonal gluon mass in the ma gauge from the slope analysis of the lattice qcd data of @xmath30 , since the four - dimensional euclidean propagator of the massive vector boson with the mass @xmath31 takes a yukawa - type asymptotic form as @xmath32 as a remarkable fact , the off - diagonal gluon behaves as a massive vector field with a large constant effective mass @xmath33 in the intermediate distance as @xmath34 in the ma gauge :    1 .",
    "@xmath35 in su(2 ) lattice qcd with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "2 .   @xmath40 in su(3 ) lattice qcd with @xmath41 ( @xmath42 0.19fm ) and @xmath37 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "thus , both in su(2 ) and su(3 ) qcd , the _ off - diagonal gluon seems to acquire a large effective mass @xmath43 in the ma gauge _ , which would be _ essence of infrared abelian dominance _ @xcite .",
    "using su(2 ) lattice qcd , we study the _ inter - monopole potential _ and the _ dual gluon propagator _ in the monopole part in the ma gauge , and show _ longitudinal magnetic screening _ in the infrared region , as a direct evidence of the _ dual higgs mechanism by monopole condensation . _ the dual gluon mass is estimated as @xmath3 0.5 gev @xcite . then , lattice qcd in the ma gauge exhibits _ infrared abelian dominance _ and _ infrared monopole condensation _ , which lead to the dual ginzburg - landau ( dgl ) theory @xcite for infrared qcd .    using su(2 ) lattice qcd",
    ", we find the structure of the monopole in the ma gauge like the t  hooft - polyakov monopole : a large off - diagonal gluon amplitude around its center , as shown in fig.3 . at a large scale",
    ", off - diagonal gluons inside monopoles become invisible , and monopoles can be regarded as point - like dirac monopoles @xcite .",
    "to clarify the similarity between qcd in the ma gauge and the nah theory , we introduce the `` gluonic higgs scalar field '' @xmath44 with @xmath45 so as to minimize @xmath46 \\equiv \\int d^4x \\ { \\rm tr }   \\left\\{[\\hat d_\\mu , \\vec \\phi(x)][\\hat d_\\mu , \\vec \\phi(x)]^\\dagger \\right\\ } \\vspace{-1.55cm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for arbitrary given euclidean gluon field @xmath47 .",
    "the gluonic higgs scalar @xmath48 physically corresponds to a `` color - direction '' of the nonabelian gauge connection @xmath49 averaged over @xmath50 at each @xmath51 .",
    "similar to @xmath49 , @xmath48 obeys the adjoint gauge transformation , and @xmath48 is diagonalized in the ma gauge .",
    "therefore , @xmath48 behaves as the higgs scalar in the nah theory , and _ the hedgehog singularity of @xmath48 provides the monopole in the ma gauge .",
    "_ this correlation is observed in lattice qcd , when the gluon field is continuous as in the su(2 ) landau gauge , as shown in fig.4 @xcite .    through the projection along @xmath48 , one can extract the abelian u(1)@xmath52 sub - gauge - manifold close to the original su(@xmath6 ) gauge manifold .",
    "this projection is manifestly gauge invariant and is equivalent to the ordinary ma projection .",
    "hence , _ infrared relevance of the gluon mode along the color - direction @xmath48 _ is observed @xcite .",
    "as t  hooft pointed out , if the dual superconductor picture is true , the off - diagonal color - charges are to be confined , and the off - diagonal gluon correlation should be cut in the infrared limit .",
    "this tendency is observed in figs.1  and  2 as the rapid vanishing of off - diagonal gluon correlators in @xmath53 .",
    "this infrared screening would occur due to the off - diagonal color - charge confinement and the off - diagonal gluon pair creation .      as an interesting possibility",
    ", we conjecture the mutual relation among the localization of the off - diagonal gluon correlation , abelian monopole condensation and the off - diagonal color - charge confinement in the ma gauge as shown in fig.5 ."
