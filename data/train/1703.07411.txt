    "when a shock propagates into a neutral fluid , upstream particles slow down at the shock front as a result of collisions with particles in the slower - moving downstream gas .",
    "in fact , binary collisions are the only possible microscopic mechanism for an upstream particle to slow down . as a consequence ,",
    "the shock front is a few mean - free - paths thick @xcite .",
    "in - situ measurements of the earth s bow - shock within the solar wind show that its front is far smaller than the mean - free - path of the ions at the same location , which is comparable to an astronomical unit @xcite",
    ". such shocks , where the mean - free - path is much larger than the front , have been dubbed `` collisionless shocks '' . instead of being sustained by binary collisions ,",
    "these shocks are mediated by collective plasma effects acting on much shorter time and length scales than binary coulomb collisions @xcite .",
    "collisionless shocks are believed to occur in a wide variety of astrophysical settings : active galactic nuclei , pulsar wind nebulae , planetary environments , supernova remnants , etc .",
    "the absence of collisions allows particles to gain energy without sharing it immediately with other particles . as a result",
    ", such shocks have been found to be excellent particle accelerators and now count among the main candidates for the production of high energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "they are also believed to play a role in the generation of gamma - ray - bursts @xcite and fast radio bursts @xcite .",
    "starting with the pioneering work of sagdeev in the 1960 s @xcite , our knowledge of collisionless shocks has grown tremendously , particularly in the past decade thanks to the advent of large scale particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations @xcite . however , as recently as the 1990 s , there were still doubts about the very existence of collisionless shocks @xcite . while the earth bow shock measurements",
    "have definitely eliminated these doubts , the micro - physics of collisionless shock formation , and the mechanism of particle acceleration , are still under investigation .    given the omnipresence of collisionless shocks and their important role in many phenomena , especially in astrophysics , the conditions for such shocks to form are worthy of investigation .",
    "a detailed understanding is all the more important that electrostatic collisionless shocks have been observed in the laboratory @xcite , while the production of weibel mediated shocks such as the ones discussed here , is expected within the next few years @xcite .",
    "note that the `` weibel instability '' we refer to is sometimes labelled `` filamentation instability '' of `` beam weibel '' instability @xcite .",
    "it is the instability of two counter - streaming flows with respect to perturbations with wave vectors normal to the flow .",
    "when a collisionless shock forms from the encounter of two plasma shells , the downstream plasma may be thermalized by collisionless processes ( see @xcite and references therein ) . as a consequence , the equations of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) can be applied , so that both collisionless shocks and mhd shocks can in principle be analysed using the same fluid approach . for the case of a flow - aligned field",
    ", mhd prescribes that the fluid and the field are decoupled @xcite , so that the very same shock should form , regardless of the field intensity .    here",
    ", we present a specific example of departure from this expected mhd behaviour .",
    "we consider the encounter of two collisionless cold pair plasmas .",
    "a flow - aligned magnetic field is present , and the system is relativistic . in section [ sec : mhd ] , we explain the predictions of mhd for this system . then",
    ", in section [ sec : pic ] , we describe a series of simulations using the particle - in - cell ( pic ) technique .",
    "these simulations work at the microscopic level , and show a departure from the mhd predictions beyond a critical magnetization . in section [ sec :",
    "micro ] , we present a micro - physics analysis of the shock formation process explaining the departure from mhd .     and",

    "the system considered is shown schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] . two identical pair plasma shells of density @xmath2 head toward each other with initial velocity @xmath3 and lorentz factor @xmath4 .",
    "the whole system is embedded in an external field @xmath5 and aligned with the @xmath6 axis .",
    "we denote by `` upstream frame '' the frame of reference of the right shell , and by `` downstream frame '' the frame where the total momentum is 0 . when a shock forms , these frames become the upstream and downstream frames of the shock , respectively .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field is measured by the magnetization parameter , @xmath7 where all quantities are measured in the downstream frame .",
    "an mhd plasma sustains 3 kinds of modes : slow mode , alfvn mode , and fast mode @xcite .",
    "the phase velocities of these modes satisfy the hierarchy @xmath8 . because of this hierarchy",
    ", the alfvn mode is sometimes dubbed the `` intermediate mode '' @xcite . in the cold limit considered here , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "a `` fast shock '' has its front moving faster than the upstream fast mode , while a `` slow shock '' only moves faster than the upstream slow mode .",
    "for fast shocks , the shock front also propagates faster than the downstream alfvn speed ; in slow shocks , it propagates slower .",
    "an intermediate regime exist , where the flow is super - alfvnic upstream and sub - alfvnic downstream ( crossing of the alfvnic point , see eg @xcite ) .",
    "however , such solutions of the mhd jump equations do not survive when produced and are called `` extraneous '' @xcite ; they typically split into a pair of `` fast '' and `` slow '' shocks .    for a flow - aligned field , the fluid motion decouples from the field @xcite .",
    "the shock formed is therefore the same , regardless of the magnetization parameter @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , its front velocity can still be compared to the phase speeds of the three modes . in the present cold limit , and for @xmath12 ,",
    "the shock is expected to be `` fast '' for @xmath13 , `` slow '' for @xmath14 , and `` extraneous '' in between ( see appendix [ ap : mhd ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sigmagamma ] shows these limits for a range of @xmath0 in the @xmath15 plane .",
    "the mhd predictions for the present system are therefore very clear : the same shock should form regardless of the @xmath11 parameter , simply because the fluid and the field are perfectly decoupled here .",

    "extraneous shocks occur in between the two thick black lines .",
    "the weibel instability governs systems located above and to the left of the orange curve .",

    "the gas magnetization is described by the @xmath11 parameter and tilt angle @xmath22 ( zero tilt angle corresponds to field perfectly parallel to the flow ) .",

    "the extraneous regime is unravelled as the shock splits into 2 sub - shocks @xcite for intermediate @xmath11 parameters .",
    "the shock is set up by reflecting a cold `` upstream '' flow from a conducting wall located at @xmath25 .",
    "the interaction between the incoming beam ( that propagates along @xmath26 ) and the reflected beam triggers the formation of a shock , which moves away from the wall along @xmath27 .",
    "this setup is equivalent to the head - on collision of two identical plasma shells ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) , which would form a forward and reverse shock and a contact discontinuity . here",
    ", we follow only one of these shocks , and replace the contact discontinuity with the conducting wall .",

    "we use a rectangular simulation box in the @xmath28 plane , with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath29 direction .",
    "the incoming plasma is injected through a `` moving injector , '' which recedes from the wall along @xmath27 at the speed of light .",
    "the simulation box is expanded in the @xmath6 direction as the injector approaches the right boundary of the computational domain .",
    "this permits us to save memory and computing time , while following the evolution of all the upstream regions that are causally connected with the shock .    in 2d , each computational cell is initialized with 16 electrons and 16 positrons .",

    "we vary the upstream lorentz factor between @xmath19 and 30 , but we find that our results are nearly insensitive to the choice of the lorentz factor , as long as the flow is ultra - relativistic . the upstream flow is seeded with a uniform magnetic field @xmath1 .    , but for @xmath38 . ]",

    "is aligned with the flow ( i.e. , we study a `` parallel shock '' ) , but we also consider quasi - parallel shocks in which the upstream field makes an angle @xmath39 with the flow direction of propagation . in this case , we also initialize a motional electric field @xmath40 in the upstream medium , where @xmath41 is the three - velocity of the injected plasma . ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta5 ] , we present the results of a suite of 2d simulations of nearly - parallel shocks , with obliquity @xmath39 .",
