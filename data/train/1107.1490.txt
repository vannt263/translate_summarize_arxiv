    "we have observed three generations of quarks and leptons , however , there is no convincing prediction for the number of generations that exist . hence examining the physics of extensions of the standard model with additional generations of quarks and leptons is worthwhile .",

    "experimental limits on the masses of fourth generation leptons , on the contrary , are much less stringent . heavy charged lepton masses must be larger than about @xmath2 , while stable ( unstable ) heavy neutral leptons must be heavier than about @xmath5 ( @xmath6 )  @xcite .    in this paper an additional vector - like fourth generation ( _ i.e. _ , a chiral fourth generation plus its mirror ) is considered . in this framework",

    "@xcite . ) since the fourth generation quarks have mass terms that do not require weak symmetry breaking , they decouple as their masses increase .",
    "if the new quarks are much heavier than the weak scale then the higgs production rate at the lhc is near its standard - model value , but we find that the @xmath7 branching ratio is reduced to about 30% of its standard - model value .",
    "this reduction depends weakly on the charged lepton masses and so it is a signature for this scenario .",
    "although the small fourth generation quark yukawa couplings do not develop landau poles below the gut or planck scale , the new leptons may give rise to landau poles in coupling constants or a vacuum instability in higgs potential .",
    "we study the impact that these leptons have on the renormalization group evolution of the yukawa couplings and the higgs self - coupling .",

    "@xcite appeared .",
    "the research presented here is similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , however this paper is focused on a particular class of models",
    "we consider a model with a vector - like fourth generation of quarks and leptons in addition to the standard - model particles .",
    "this fourth generation has the @xmath16 left - handed quark doublet , @xmath17 , right - handed up- and down - type quark singlets , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , left - handed lepton doublet , @xmath20 , and right - handed charged and neutral lepton singlets , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the mirror fourth generation particles are : the @xmath16 right - handed quark doublet , @xmath23 , left - handed up- and down - type quark singlets , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the right - handed lepton doublet , @xmath26 , and the left - handed charged and neutral leptons singlets , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "their @xmath29 charges are the same as the existing fermions in the standard model .",
    "in addition to their gauge invariant kinetic terms , the new quarks have the following mass terms and yukawa couplings to the higgs doublet denoted as @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the antisymmetric @xmath33 matrix ( in weak @xmath16 space ) with non zero components , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . here",
    "we ignore terms which mix the fourth generation quarks with the familiar quarks for simplicity .",
    "however , we imagine that there are small couplings of this type that allow the new quarks to decay .",
    "( for constraints on the mixings in quark sector , as well as lepton sector , from experiments , see _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "such mixings are forbidden if there is a global @xmath36 symmetry where the fourth generation quarks and the ordinary quarks have different charge .",
    "if the breaking of this symmetry is small , then the mixings are expected to be small .",
    "for the new leptons , the analogous couplings are given by @xmath37 the crucial difference between the quark and lepton sectors is the absence of bare lepton mass terms .",
    "the bare mass terms , in addition to the terms which mix the new leptons and ordinary leptons , can be forbidden if one assumes a global @xmath36 symmetry where the primed leptons , double primed leptons and ordinary leptons have different charge .",
    "when the charge of the ordinary leptons under this symmetry is zero , then the ordinary neutrinos can have majorana masses .",
    "if there is no mixing between the fourth generation and ordinary leptons , one can have an acceptable scenario with stable fourth generation neutrinos .",
    "usually one does not impose global symmetries since quantum gravity effects will violate them .",
    "however , it is possible that there are underlying gauge symmetries that leave eqs .",
    "( [ quark ] ) and ( [ lepton ] ) as the low energy effective theory after they spontaneously break .",
    "in fact baryon and lepton number could be such gauge symmetries . by adding a vector - like fourth generation one can gauge baryon and lepton number provided the difference in baryon number between the fourth generation and mirror generation is @xmath38 and the difference in lepton number between the fourth generation and mirror generation is @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "the quarks in these families have mass terms that do not require weak symmetry breaking provided we introduce a scalar , @xmath40 , with baryon number @xmath41 that gets a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "similarly fourth generation lepton masses that do not require weak symmetry breaking arise if a scalar , @xmath42 , with lepton number @xmath43 gets a vev",
    ". however this charge for @xmath42 is not preferred since then one can not generate light neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "if we use @xmath42 with lepton number @xmath44 to break lepton number , majorana neutrino masses for the light neutrinos are generated through the seesaw mechanism and furthermore proton decay is forbidden since the field that breaks lepton number has even charge . in that case",
    "the breaking of lepton number does not give rise to mass terms for the fourth generation leptons .",
    "it is appropriate to keep the fourth generation quarks in the low energy effective theory if their masses are well below the scale of baryon number symmetry breaking .",
    "however , there is no particular reason for this to be the case and the generic situation is that one would only be left with just the fourth generation leptons and the standard - model particles in the low energy effective theory .",
    "here we discuss phenomenology of the higgs boson in the model with the vector - like fourth generation . in this model",
    "the fourth generation quark and lepton masses have different origins .",
    "thus they have different impact on the properties of the higgs boson . in this section",
    "we discuss higgs boson production and decay at the lhc .      here",
    "we study the impact of vector - like fourth generation on higgs production at the lhc . in the usual chiral fourth generation scenario , the higgs production rate , which is dominated by the gluon fusion process ,",
    "is increased by about a factor of nine and this result is almost independent of the chiral fourth generation quark masses .",

    "<S> it is possible that there are additional vector - like generations where the quarks have mass terms that do not originate from weak symmetry breaking , but the leptons only get mass through weak symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the impact that the new leptons have on higgs boson decay branching ratios and on the range of allowed higgs masses in such a model ( with a single new vector - like generation ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that if the fourth generation leptons are too heavy to be produced in higgs decay , then the new leptons reduce the branching ratio for @xmath0 to about 30% of its standard - model value . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of this branching ratio on the new charged lepton masses is weak . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the expected higgs production rate at the lhc is very near its standard - model value if the new quarks are much heavier than the weak scale . if the new quarks have masses near the cutoff for the theory , then for cutoffs greater than @xmath1 , the new lepton masses can not be much heavier than about @xmath2 and the higgs mass must have a value around @xmath3 . </S>"
