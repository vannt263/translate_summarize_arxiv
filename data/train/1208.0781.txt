    "the mass of super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) is of fundamental importance for understanding active galactic nuclei ( agn ) which are powered by mass accretion onto a smbh .",
    "analysis of agn variability by applying the technique of reverberation mapping ( rm ) has been established as a powerful tool to determine the size of the broad emission - line region ( blr ) of agn ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; horne et al.2004 ; netzer & peterson 1997 ; peterson 2003 ) and , under the assumption of virial gas motion , consequently the smbh mass ( e.g. , peterson et al.2004 ) .",
    "large observational efforts are required to obtain data of sufficient quality and temporal coverage to study agn variability and to employ rm methods .",
    "currently , about 50 agn have been monitored for periods of at least a few months , usually as part of international collaborations .",
    "the entire available database of reverberation observations obtained through 2003 was uniformly re - analyzed with improved methods of time series analysis to minimize systematic errors ( peterson et al.2004 ) .",
    "some of these results have been superseded by more recent experiments ( bentz et al.2006b,2007a ; denney et al.2006,2009a ; grier et al.2008 ; woo et al.2010 ) and additional reverberation results steadily increase the size and quality of the database ( e.g. , bentz et al.2009b,2010a ; denney et al.2009b,2010 ) .",
    "it has been shown that agn and non - active galaxies follow the same relation between the black hole mass , m@xmath20 , and stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath21 , of the central spheroidal component of the host galaxy ( ferrarese et al.2001 ; gebhardt et al.2000 ; gltekin et al.2009 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; tremaine et al.2002 ) and that the masses based on rm studies are consistent with the masses derived from the m@xmath20 - @xmath21 relation ( nelson et al.2004 ; onken et al.2004 ; woo et al.2010 ) .",
    "the close relations of the black hole mass with physical properties of the host galaxy , e.g. stellar velocity dispersion , bulge mass and bulge luminosity , indicate a coupled growth of the black hole and the formation and evolution of the host galaxy ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; haiman & loeb 1998,2001 ; bromm & loeb 2003 ; dimatteo et al.2004 ; yoo & miralda - escud 2004 ; volonteri & rees 2006 ; volonteri & begelman 2010 ) .    the broad - line radio galaxy ( blrg )",
    "3c390.3 is a bright and nearby ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ; osterbrock , koski , & phillips 1976 ) frii radio galaxy with extended double - lobed radio emission ( leahy & perley 1995 ) . after the identification as optical counterpart of the radio source 3c390.3 ( wyndham 1966 ) ,",
    "it was classified as a n - type galaxy by sandage ( 1966 ) .",
    "soon , it was discovered that 3c390.3 shows very broad balmer emission - lines ( lynds 1968 ) which were later recognized as prominent double - peaked emission - line profiles ( burbidge & burbidge 1971 ) .",
    "these double - peaked profiles are generally regarded as a characteristic signature of accretion disk emission ( e.g. , eracleous & halpern 1994,2003 ; gezari , halpern , & eracleous 2007 ) .",
    "so far almost all agn variability studies have focused on radio - quiet agn .",
    "however , 3c390.3 has a well - known variability history ( e.g. , cannon , penston , & penston 1968 ; selmes , tritton , & wordsworth 1975 ; barr et al.1980 ; penston & perez 1984 ; veilleux & zheng 1991 ; zheng 1996 ; wamsteker et al.1997 ; obrien et al.1998 ; dietrich et al.1998 ; sergeev et al.2002 ; tao et al.2008 ) , with photometric measurements going back to 1968 ( yee & oke 1981 ) . using the harvard plate collection shen ,",
    "usher , & barrett ( 1972 ) traced back brightness variations to 1895 .",
    "thus , 3c390.3 was a prime target of a multiwavelength monitoring campaign in 1994/95 especially because of previous reports of dramatic changes in the balmer line profile shape and strength and to perform coordinated x - ray / uv / optical monitoring of a radio - loud agn for the first time .",
    "currently , 3c120 and 3c390.3 are the only radio - loud agn which have been monitored in detail .",
    "the multiwavelength study of 3c390.3 in 1994/95 ( leighly et al.1997 ; obrien et al.1998 ; dietrich et al.1998 ) shows significant variations in the x - ray , uv , and optical domain over a period of one year .",
    "however , the light curves of the uv and optical variations show a nearly monotonic increase of the continuum and emission - line flux with only moderately strong substructures .",
    "the measured delays of several broad emission - lines relative to the observed continuum variations are about @xmath24days for h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 ( dietrich et al.1998 ) and @xmath25 to 60days ( @xmath26days ) for iv civ  and ly@xmath0 ( obrien et al.1998 ) .",
    "more recently , sergeev et al.(2002 ) studied the variability characteristics of 3c390.3 for a period of nearly one decade .",
    "they found a longer delay of the response of the h@xmath1 emission with respect to continuum variations compared to the result of the 1994/95 study .",
    "they concluded that the difference might be caused by different continuum variability characteristics which manifest in different continuum auto - correlation functions .",
    "recently , shapovalova et al.(2010 ) , jovanovic et al.(2010 ) , popovic et al.(2011 ) , and sergeev et al.(2011 ) discussed profile variations over periods from a few years up to about 15 years .    in the following work ,",
    "we present the results of a monitoring campaign undertaken at mdm observatory in late 2005 .",
    "based on imaging and spectroscopic data , we find that 3c390.3 clearly showed broad band variations , delayed variations of the broad balmer emission - lines h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and h@xmath27 , and of the helium line heii@xmath3 .",
    "using the time delays and the peak separation in the rms spectra of these emission lines , we estimate a virial black hole mass of m@xmath13 for 3c390.3 and using @xmath14 of the rms spectra m@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the detection of superluminal motion for 3c390.3 indicates an inclination angle of @xmath28 which allows to correct the observed velocity for the tilt of the line emitting region relative to the observer .",
    "taking this into account , we derive a black hole mass of m@xmath29 ( peak separation ) and m@xmath30 ( @xmath14 ) for 3c390.3 , respectively , which is , within the uncertainties , consistent with recent results based on the caii@xmath31 stellar absorption triplet and the @xmath32 relation ( lewis & eracleous 2006 ; nelson et al.2004 ) .",
    "we revisited 3c390.3 to determine the size of the blr with improved accuracy . in 2005 from september until december we used the 2.4-m hiltner telescope at mdm observatory to obtain spectroscopic and imaging data ( table1 ) .",
    "the instrumental setup of the boller & chivens ccd spectrograph ( ccds ) and imaging camera retrocam ( morgan et al.2005 ) was kept unchanged for the entire observing campaign to achieve a homogeneous data set , i.e. , avoiding the impact of different instrumental settings .",
    "the spectrograph was equipped with a loral 1200x800 pixel ccd , with a projected pixel size that corresponds to @xmath33/pixel . to cover the entire optical wavelength range ,",
    "a 150 grooves / mm grating was used with a fixed grating tilt for the entire observing season .",
    "the slit width was set to a uniform value of @xmath34 and a position angle of pa@xmath35 . to allow for correction of cosmic ray event contamination",
    ", at each epoch two spectra were recorded for 3c390.3 with an integration time of t@xmath36=900s each .",
    "in contrast to previous campaigns we observed hd217086 ( bd@xmath37 , o7vn ) for the entire campaign for flux calibration to minimize the uncertainty which is introduced by flux calibrations that are based on different standard stars .",
    "in addition , hd217086 was employed to correct for strong atmospheric absorption bands , i.e. , the o@xmath38 c - band ( @xmath39 ) , o@xmath38 b - band ( @xmath40 ) , and broad h@xmath38o absorption ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this is especially important for the broad h@xmath0 emission line profile which is severely affected by the b - band absorption . in total ,",
    "optical spectra were recorded for 28 epochs ( table1 ) .",
    "in addition , 3c390.3 was simultaneously observed for 25 epochs in sdss _",
    "g_-band ( fukugita et al.1996 ) using retrocam at the 2.4-m telescope ( table1 ) .",
    "retrocam was equipped with a e2v ccd55 - 20 ( 1152x770 pixel ) with a pixel size of @xmath42 m , which corresponds to @xmath43/pixel .",
    "the optical design of retrocam provides the valuable option to switch between spectroscopic and imaging mode in less than 2 minutes .",
    "thus , the _",
    "g_-band measurements were taken no more than a few minutes before the spectroscopic observations .",
    "the exposure time was uniformly set to t@xmath36=120 sec and generally one exposure was recorded .",
    "the spectra of 3c390.3 and the standard star hd217086 , as well as the _ g_-band imaging data were processed using midas software .",
    "standard dark and flat - field corrections were applied to the spectra and _ g_-band imaging data of 3c390.3 and the hd217086 spectra .",
    "we subtracted the night sky intensity for each spectrum individually .",
    "the night sky fit was based on two regions , @xmath44 to @xmath45 wide on average , which were separated by @xmath46 relative to the spectrum of 3c390.3 and hd217086 , respectively .",
    "a @xmath47 order polynomial fit was used for each wavelength element to fit the spatial intensity distribution of the night sky emission .",
    "argon  xenon comparison spectra were recorded for each spectrum of 3c390.3 for wavelength calibration , which is based on @xmath48 to 20 individual lines .",
    "the wavelength calibration yields a sampling of @xmath49 / pxl .",
    "the spectral resolution , measuring the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of isolated lines in the argon ",
    "xenon spectra , amounts to @xmath50 at @xmath51 .",
    "the spectra of 3c390.3 were corrected for galactic reddening using @xmath52 ( schlegel et al.1998 ) .    to transform the observed spectra into the rest - frame of 3c390.3",
    ", we measured a redshift of z = @xmath53 which is based on the narrow emission lines of h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , [ oi]@xmath54 , [ oiii]@xmath55 , and [ oiii]@xmath56 . in the following , we present the analysis of the rest - frame spectra of 3c390.3 and discuss the results based on this spectra .",
    "we used the flat - field corrected images to measure the _ g_-band flux of 3c390.3 relative to comparison stars in the field .",
    "the approach of relative photometry has the advantage of being quite insensitive to weather conditions , i.e. , photometric conditions are not required .",
    "the blrg 3c390.3 is among a sample of 34 agn which were carefully studied by penston , penston , & sandage ( 1971 ) .",
    "they provide johnson u , b , v magnitudes for three non - variable stars in the field of 3c390.3 .",
    "retrocam which has a field of view of @xmath57 , allows us to observe stars a and b together with 3c390.3 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "however , with an apparent brightness of @xmath58 , star a is usually saturated in the observed _ g_-band frames .",
    "star b has a magnitude ( @xmath59 ) comparable to that of 3c390.3 .",
    "this star was already successfully employed in a prior monitoring campaign of 3c390.3 as a flux standard ( dietrich et al.1998 ) .",
    "hence , we used star b to determine the relative broad - band flux changes of 3c390.3 .    to measure the _ g_-band flux of 3c390.3 and of star b",
    ", we applied a square aperture with a size of of @xmath60 ( fig.1 ) . by using such a large aperture for the comparison star and particularly for 3c390.3",
    "we ensured that the total flux is recorded independently of the seeing , which varied from @xmath61 to @xmath62 with an average of @xmath63 during this monitoring campaign . to correct for the night sky flux ,",
    "the object aperture was separated by a 2  wide region ( so - called no - mans - land ) from a 2  wide region that enclosed the square aperture ( fig.1 ) .",
    "this outer region provided an average sky brightness which was used to correct the observed flux of the object for the night sky contribution .        to study broad emission - line flux variations ,",
    "it is necessary to calibrate the spectra to a uniform flux level .",
    "this can be achieved using the flux of forbidden narrow emission - lines from the narrow - line region ( nlr ) . due to the large spatial extension of the nlr ( of the order of 100pc in seyfert galaxies ) and the long recombination time scales which are due to the low gas density of the nlr ( @xmath64years for @xmath65@xmath66 )",
    ", light travel - time effects and long recombination time scales will damp out short time - scale variability .",
    "thus , it can be assumed that the flux of narrow emission lines can be treated as constant , at least on time scales of years to decades ( e.g. , peterson 1993,2000 ) .",
    "however , 3c390.3 needs careful additional attention .",
    "the nlr of 3c390.3 seems to be very compact ( baum et al.1988 ; sergeev et al.2002 ) and the small emission - line flux ratio of f([oiii]@xmath67 ) to f([oiii]@xmath56 ) indicates the presence of high density gas ( @xmath68@xmath66 ) .",
    "furthermore , narrow - line variability has been reported for this object .",
    "clavel & wamsteker ( 1987 ) analyzed the strength of the narrow ly@xmath0 and iv civ@xmath69 emission lines .",
    "they found that the strength of these two narrow lines decreased by a factor of about 2 to 3 from 1978 to 1986 . on the basis of optical spectra obtained between 1974 and 1990 , zheng et al.(1995 ) presented evidence that the fluxes of [ oiii]@xmath67 follow continuum variations , although on a longer time scale than the broad emission - lines . during the period of decreasing or increasing [ oiii ] flux there",
    "might also be periods of several months or years of nearly constant [ oiii ] flux .",
    "hence , we examined the data closely to test for variability of the [ oiii ] emission lines before we used them for flux calibration .    to test the reliability of the narrow [ oiii ] emission lines as an internal calibrator , the _ g_-band imaging data are of great value .",
    "as noted earlier , these broad band flux measurements were taken nearly simultaneously with the spectra , i.e. , within minutes of the spectral observations ( table1 ) and the _ g_-band brightness of 3c390.3 was measured with high precision ( see  4.2 , @xmath70% ) . to compare the _",
    "g_-band variations to those which can be derived from the spectral data , the spectra were convolved with the transmission curve of the sdss",
    "_ g_-band filter .",
    "the fluxes of the convolved spectra were measured for the transmission wavelength range of the _ g_-band filter curve ( @xmath71  to 6000 ) . to adjust the flux level of the spectra to the _ g_-band measurements ,",
    "the spectra were rescaled .",
    "these scaling factors are on average @xmath72 .",
    "we used these adjusted spectra , based on the observed _",
    "g_-band flux variations , to test whether the [ oiii]@xmath73 emission line flux was constant during this monitoring campaign .",
    "although the broad - band flux measurements include the broad and narrow h@xmath12 emission - line flux , as well as the [ oiii]@xmath55 line emission , the contribution of emission line variability to photometric variations can be neglected ( walsh et al.2009 ) if it amounts to less than @xmath74%  of the broad band flux .",
    "for 3c390.3 we find that the h@xmath12 flux amounts to less than 5%  of the g - band flux . to test the assumption that the [ oiii]@xmath73 emission line flux was constant for the duration of this monitoring campaign , these adjusted spectra were internally flux calibrated by scaling each individual spectrum to a uniform flux of the [ oiii]@xmath73 emission line .",
    "first , we calculated a mean spectrum which was used as a reference spectrum .",
    "next , we applied a modified version of the scaling algorithm of van groningen & wanders ( 1992 ) to adjust the flux of the [ oiii]@xmath73 in the individual spectra to the reference spectrum .",
    "this routine minimizes the residuals of the [ oiii]@xmath73 in a difference spectrum which is calculated for each spectrum with the reference spectrum .",
    "the intercalibration to a uniform flux level was achieved by allowing different flux scales , small wavelength shifts , and different spectral resolutions .",
    "the average scaling factor amounts to @xmath75 .",
    "this result indicates that the [ oiii]@xmath73 flux was constant in the adjusted spectra with a flux of f([oiii]@xmath73 ) = @xmath76ergs@xmath77@xmath78 ( table 2 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that during the monitoring campaign of 3c390.3 in 1995 ( dietrich et al.1998 ) the [ oiii]@xmath73 emission line flux was measured to be f([oiii]@xmath73 ) = @xmath79ergs@xmath77@xmath78 ( rest frame flux ) which is about @xmath48%  lower .",
    "this indicates that the [ oiii]@xmath73 emission line flux was lower in 1995 compared to 2005 when 3c390.3 was in a less luminous state .",
    "based on the average scaling factor and the small scatter , it is justified to assume that the f([oiii]@xmath67 ) emission - line flux was constant during this monitoring campaign .    while the h@xmath1  [ oiii]@xmath55 region is scaled with respect to the narrow [ oiii]@xmath73 line , we investigated whether this internal calibration holds for the h@xmath0 region at longer wavelengths and the h@xmath27  [ oiii]@xmath56 region at shorter wavelengths .",
    "we intercalibrated the spectra for the h@xmath0 region with respect to the fluxes of the relatively strong [ oi]@xmath54 emission line and the h@xmath27  [ oiii]@xmath56 region using the narrow [ oiii]@xmath56 emission line .",
    "we found that the h@xmath0 region required small adjustments to achieve a constant [ oi]@xmath54 flux .",
    "the average scaling factor for the h@xmath0 region amounts to @xmath80 . for the h@xmath27  [ oiii]@xmath56 region , minor rescaling of the spectra was also necessary .",
    "these scaling factors are on average @xmath81 .",
    "a spectrum of an active galactic nucleus is the superposition of various sources , including the host galaxy , thermal and non - thermal continuum emission from the agn , which can be described by a power - law continuum , balmer continuum emission , feii  line emission , and emission from other metal line transitions , e.g. , carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , magnesium , neon , sulfur .",
    "these contributions need to be accounted for in order to obtain reliable line measurements and the strength of the agn continuum that most of our study relies on .",
    "we adopted a multi - component fit approach ( e.g. , wills et al.1985 ) that we have successfully applied in prior studies of high-@xmath82 quasars and narrow line seyfert1 ( nls1 ) galaxies ( for more details see dietrich et al.2002a,2003b,2005,2009 ) .",
    "we assume that the spectrum of 3c390.3 can be described as a superposition of three components , ( i ) a power law continuum ( f@xmath83 ) , ( ii ) a host galaxy spectrum ( kinney et al.1996 ) , and ( iii ) a pseudo - continuum due to merging feii  emission blends .",
    "neither a balmer nor a paschen continuum emission were taken into account because the balmer edge at @xmath84  is close to the short wavelength end of our spectra of 3c390.3 and the strength of the paschen continuum is only weakly constrained ( korista & goad 2001 ) .    as demonstrated by bentz et al.(2006a,2009a )",
    "it is crucial to correct for the host galaxy contribution to measure the strength of the agn continuum flux density .",
    "based on acs / hst images which were obtained for 14 agn of the agn - watch sample ( peterson et al.2004 ) , bentz et al.(2009a ) estimated the host galaxy contribution to the continuum flux density at @xmath45100  for those agn , including 3c390.3 . for the large aperture of ( @xmath85 ) which we used ,",
    "the galaxy contribution amounts to @xmath86 ergs@xmath77@xmath78@xmath77 , based on acs / hst imaging data ( bentz priv.comm . ) .",
    "the average host galaxy contribution which we determined , based on the multi - component fits , is @xmath87 ergs@xmath77@xmath78@xmath77 , i.e. , within the errors consistent with the measurements based on the acs image . to construct representative host galaxy template spectra we combined several individual spectra of various hubble types .",
    "these galaxy spectra were retrieved from the publicly available sample published by kinney et al.(1996 ) .",
    "the spectral resolution of these galaxy spectra amounts to @xmath88   which is comparable to the spectral resolution of our spectra .    to account for feii  emission",
    ", we used the rest - frame optical feii  template that is based on observations of izw1 by boroson & green ( 1992 ) which covers the wavelength range from 4250  to 7000 . an alternative optical feii  emission line template was presented by vron - cetty et al.(2004 ) which in addition takes into account nlr contributions to the feii  emission . in general , these two templates are similar but in detail they differ at around @xmath89  and @xmath90 .",
    "the optical feii  emission in the spectrum of 3c390.3 is weak , however , and the width of the feii  emission is expected to be quite broad , as is seen for other permitted emission lines .",
    "therefore , the choice of the feii  emission template has no impact on the results of this study .    the components ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) were simultaneously fitted to the spectra of 3c390.3 that were intercalibrated with respect to the [ oiii]@xmath67 emission - line flux , to determine the minimum @xmath91 of the fit .",
    "various host galaxy templates were employed and the best results were obtained using an appropriately scaled spectrum of the e0 galaxy ngc1407 , which is consistent with the morphological type of the host galaxy of 3c390.3 . the width of the feii  emission template was allowed to vary from fwhm=3000 kms@xmath77 up to 9000 kms@xmath77 in steps of @xmath92fwhm=500 kms@xmath77 .",
    "the best fit results were achieved for feii  emission templates whose width was on average fwhm=@xmath93 kms@xmath77 , ranging from fwhm=5000 kms@xmath77 to fwhm=8500 kms@xmath77 . in fig.2",
    "we show the fit for a typical spectrum of 3c390.3 from this study , to illustrate the method to determine the different components .",
    "the uncertainty of the fit was estimated based on the distribution of @xmath91 around the minimum .",
    "the spectral slope @xmath0 of the continuum fit has an average error of @xmath94 , while the uncertainties in the continuum flux density at @xmath95 and the feii  emission flux are of the order of @xmath96% .",
    "the best fit of the components ( i ) to ( iii ) were subtracted before we continued to analyze the emission - line profiles of interest .",
    "the spectrum of 3c390.3 shows strong narrow - line emission ( fig.2 ) .",
    "hence , it is necessary to correct the broad emission - lines for nlr contributions before line flux and profile parameters are measured .",
    "in addition , the study of the narrow emission - lines provide information about the ionizing continuum strength . under the assumption that the nlr emission is constant during the observing period in 2005 ( september to december ) , we measured the line strength of the narrow emission - lines in the individual spectra of the entire campaign .",
    "this is an additional test for the quality of the intercalibration of the spectral region of the broad emission - lines , studied for variability .",
    "we used a strong nlr emission line as a template profile to fit the narrow - line spectrum and determine its flux ( e.g. , whittle 1985c ; dietrich et al.2005 ) . using high - quality , high - resolution spectra , whittle ( 1985a",
    ", b ) showed that nlr emission - line profiles are similar and in particular that the balmer emission - line profiles are identical to the [ oiii]@xmath73 line profile within the uncertainties , even in the case of strong profile asymmetries .",
    "therefore , we used the strong emission - line profile of [ oiii]@xmath73 to obtain a representative nlr line profile template . to obtain such a profile template we made use of a spectrum of 3c390.3 which we observed with the 2.2 m telescope at calar alto observatory / spain ( aug.30 , 1994 ) . at this time 3c390.3 was at a lower intensity level than in 2005 , i.e. , the narrow emission - lines are more pronounced ( fig.3 ) .",
    "this spectrum which covers a wavelength range comparable to this study , has the advantage of a higher spectral resolution ( r@xmath97 at @xmath98 ) .    to isolate the [ oiii ] emission lines which are located in the extended red wing of the double - peaked h@xmath1 line profile we used an appropriately scaled h@xmath99 profile to recover the red wing of h@xmath100 .",
    "this scaled h@xmath0 profile was subtracted and the residual was used to fit the [ oiii]@xmath55 line profiles ( fig.4 ) .",
    "the [ oiii ] line profiles are well described using a dominant narrow gaussian component ( fwhm=@xmath101 ) and a broader gaussian component ( fwhm=@xmath102 ) which is slightly blue - shifted by @xmath103kms@xmath77 , to account for the base of the line profile ( fig.5 ) .",
    "we find that the narrow component carries @xmath104%  of the [ oiii]@xmath73 emission - line flux .",
    "the individual gaussian components have a priori no physical meaning by themselves , but are just used to obtain a nlr line profile template .",
    "the [ oiii]@xmath73 emission - line profile fit (  3.3 ) was used to measure the nlr emission - line flux of the narrow lines in the spectra of 3c390.3 .",

    "as in former studies of 3c390.3 , we extracted light curves for different parts of the broad emission - line profile . for better comparison with prior studies ( e.g. ,",
    "dietrich et al.1998 ; gezari et al.2007 ; shapovalova et al.2010 ) the width and placement of those regions are motivated by the location and the widths of the blue and red peak in the double - peaked line profile .    in table 7",
    "the location of the blue peak and red peak for the h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and h@xmath27 emission - line profiles are given .",
    "within @xmath189 kms@xmath77 both peaks are at similar velocities . based on the mean line profiles ( fig.9 )",
    "the width of the peaks amounts to fwhm@xmath18350  and fwhm@xmath18370  for h@xmath12 and h@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we investigated the profiles of the h@xmath0 and h@xmath12 emission lines only because the h@xmath27 emission line is too weak and heii@xmath3 is best represented by a single gaussian profile .",
    "we extracted the light curves of the blue and red peak for a 3000 kms@xmath77 wide region . in figure 14 the boundaries of the blue and red wings , the blue and red peaks , and the line center are shown . for comparison the location of those profile sections are given in table 8 which were used by gezari et al.(2007 ) .",
    "the errors for the extracted light curves were determined following the same approach as for the integrated emission line fluxes .",
    "next , the h@xmath0 and h@xmath12 line profile section variations are cross - correlated with the _",
    "g_-band light curve , as well as with the agn continuum f@xmath172(5100 ) . in figure 15 the corresponding iccf(@xmath190 ) are shown .",
    "while for h@xmath0 the light curves of the blue wings , the blue and red peak and of the line center result into iccfs with well defined structures , the light curve of the red wing of the broad h@xmath0 line profile results into a iccf which provides merely an indication for a possible delay ( fig.15 ) .",
    "for the h@xmath12 line profile the iccfs are broad and in the case of the red wing for h@xmath12 there is only a weak indication for a marginally defined peak ( fig.15 ) .    the location of the centroid , the peak and the uncertainties in the iccfs for the wings , the peaks , and the line center of the h@xmath0 and h@xmath12 emission lines are determined using the technique described above (  4.3 ) and the results are given in table 9 . as can be seen already in figure 15 ,",
    "the blue and red peak of the h@xmath0 line and of the h@xmath12 line vary basically with the same time delay relative to the continuum variations , consistent with the model that the hydrogen balmer line emission originates in a rotating disk ( e.g. , eracleous & halpern 1994 ; flohic & eracleous 2008 ) . within the uncertainties there is also no delay of the profile wings with respect to the peaks or the center of the line profile . to test this result",
    "we also applied the time series analysis to the variations of the blue and red wings and the blue and red peaks to eliminate uncertainties which are introduced by the continuum light curves .",
    "the corresponding iccfs for the h@xmath99 and h@xmath12 lines are displayed in figures 16 . within the uncertainties we detect no time delay between the variations of the blue and red peaks and wings ( table9 ) .",
    "generally , the time delay between continuum and broad emission line flux variations is determined by calculating cross - correlation functions . however , for a better specification of the possible impact of gaps in the temporal coverage of the light curves , recently an alternative approach has been suggested by zu et al.(2011 ) and applied by grier et al.(2012 ) to the measured variability of the nls1 galaxy mkn335 .",
    "this method to analyze irregularly sampled light curves with a more statistical approach was developed by press et al.(1992 ) and rybicki & press ( 1992 ) .",
    "they assumed that an irregularly sampled light curve can be treated as a damped random walk process with a specific amplitude @xmath191 and an exponential damping time scale @xmath192 . in recent years",
    "it has been shown that quasar light curves can be , indeed , well described with this approach ( kelly et al.2009 ; zu et al.2012 ) and furthermore that the amplitude @xmath191 and damping time scale @xmath192 for quasar variability are found in a well defined region of the @xmath191  @xmath192 space ( kozowski et al.2010 ; macleod et al.2010 ) .",
    "recently , mushotzky et al.(2011 ) , however , have shown using kepler data for four agn , that the variability of all agn can not be described with the random walk approach but that individual agn have intrinsically different variability characteristics .    to investigate",
    "also agn variability data and in particular the impact of gaps in the temporal sampling in agn light curves zu et al.(2011 ) have modified this statistical approach .",
    "we used their method of stochastic process estimation for agn reverberation ( spear ) as presented by zu et al.(2011 ) to investigate the variations of 3c390.3 ( fig.6 ) .",
    "first , we used the _",
    "g_-band variation and the f@xmath172(5100 ) variability to test whether the spear results are consistent with our cross - correlation results ( table6 ) .",
    "we started with an amplitude of @xmath193 and an damping time scale of @xmath194days .",
    "with the _ g_-band variations as a driver light curve ( because of its much smaller errors than the f@xmath172(5100 ) light curve ) , we find using spear a delay of @xmath195days which is consistent with the cross - correlation result .",
    "next , we used the _",
    "g_-band light curve as the driver to recover the time delays of the h@xmath0 , h@xmath12 , h@xmath2 , and heii@xmath3 variations . using spear",
    "we computed time delays for the strong balmer lines h@xmath0 and h@xmath12 which are basically identical within the errors to the cross - correlation based delays . in the case of the h@xmath2 and heii@xmath3 emission lines , however , the delays determined with spear and based on the cross - correlation analysis show some differences . the time delays of the balmer lines h@xmath0 , h@xmath12 , and",
    "h@xmath2 derived with _",
    "spear _ are consistent with those of the iccf analysis using f@xmath172(5100 ) as the driving continuum . however , for the heii@xmath3 emission lines the delays are just consistent within the 1-@xmath196 errors . the time delay of the h@xmath2 variations based on the g - band light curve as the driver continuum and the _ spear _ result differ by nearly a factor of 2 ( table 6 ) .",
    "furthermore , due to the larger uncertainties of the flux measurements for the h@xmath2 and heii@xmath3 emission lines , _ spear _ needed to be restricted to a narrow range of allowed time delays to avoid spurious delays at @xmath197 days , which is longer than the period covered by the experiment .",
    "spear treats large gaps in the temporal coverage of a light curve in a statistically based approach and also follows the impact on the uncertainty of the time delay . however , in the case of the study of 3c390.3 with no large gaps in the light curve , we applied spear predominantly to compare the results with those of the iccf analysis and the results of both methods do well agree .",
    "hence , we used the results of the iccf analysis in the following for consistency with former variability investigations which allows an easier comparison with those results .        to determine the mass of the black hole in the center of 3c390.3",
    ", we assumed that the line - emitting gas is bound , i.e. , that the virial theorem can be applied .",
    "this approach is well - motivated by the results of the fitting of the double - peaked emission line profiles of 3c390.3 with an elliptical disk model ( flohic & eracleous 2008 ) .",
    "in addition , for several agn it has been possible to measure the time delay of additional broad emission line flux variations .",
    "these studies consistently show that emission - lines with higher ionization energies show shorter time delays , in keeping with the observed ionization stratification of the blr and their closer locations to the central continuum source ( bentz et al.2009a ; kollatschny 2003 ; onken & peterson 2002 ; peterson & wandel 1999,2000 ) . together with broader emission line",
    "profile widths , these results provide strong support that the gas is in gravitational bound motion .",
    "the virial mass of the black hole is given by    @xmath198    with @xmath199 as the size of the broad emission line region , @xmath200 which is associated with the line profile width , and @xmath201 as the gravitational constant .",
    "the factor @xmath202 depends of the geometry , kinematics , and the orientation of the line emitting region .",
    "it has been shown by onken et al.(2004 ) that the average of @xmath202 amounts to @xmath203 when the virial black hole mass , based on a rms spectrum profile width , is calibrated to the @xmath32 relation for quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , tremaine et al.2002 ; gltekin et al.2009 , 2011 ) . in the following",
    "we calculate the pure virial product , i.e. , we will assume @xmath204 because in the case of 3c390.3 and the successful accretion disk models @xmath205 can be used to derive the intrinsic velocity , @xmath206 , of the gas .",
    "@xmath207    using the second moment of the emission - line profiles @xmath14 ( cf.peterson et al.2004 ) for the mean and rms spectra ( table 4 ) and the measured time delay of the broad emission - line flux response to continuum variations , given by @xmath182 ( table 6 ) , derived from a threshold of 80%  of the maximum of the iccf , we calculated the virial black hole mass using eq.(4 ) .",
    "the results are presented in table 10 . for comparison",
    "we estimated black hole masses for the individual emission lines using @xmath14 from the the mean and the rms spectra and the time delay which we derived using the agn continuum variations of f@xmath172(5100 ) and of the _ g_-band , as well ( table 6 ) .",
    "we find that within the uncertainties the virial mass , m@xmath208 , of the black hole of 3c390.3 , based on the mean emission line profiles , is in the range of @xmath209 to @xmath210 based on the properties of the mean profiles of the balmer lines and the heii@xmath3 emission line , independent of the continuum used ( fig.17 , table10 ) .",
    "however , if only the strong balmer emission lines h@xmath0 and h@xmath12 are considered because the uncertainties for the h@xmath2 and heii@xmath3 emission lines are larger , the virial products are in better agreement , @xmath211 to @xmath210 .",
    "the rms spectra yield results which are consistent with the mean - spectrum with virial black hole masses of @xmath212 to @xmath213 ( table10 ) and the strong balmer emission lines h@xmath0 and h@xmath12 yield black hole mass estimates of about @xmath214 .",
    "since , the rms spectrum represents the actually variable part of the emission line profile , we conclude that the virial product of the black hole of 3c390.3 , based on the strong balmer emission lines h@xmath0 and h@xmath12 is m@xmath215 .",
    "to estimate the black hole mass m@xmath20 using reverberation mapping studies , it is still necessary to specify the factor @xmath202 in eq.(3 ) which depends on the not well - constrained geometry and kinematics of the gas , as well as on the orientation of the line emitting region . while it is generally assumed that this factor @xmath202 is of the order of unity , it has been pointed out that a small inclination of the line emitting region can result in a significant underestimation of the black hole mass ( e.g. , collin et al.2006 ) if the gas motions are almost entirely in the disk plane with little motion in the polar direction . in contrast to",
    "almost all agn monitored so far , the blrg 3c390.3 is unique since it is the only radio loud agn with extended double - lobed radio emission ( leahy & perley 1995 ) whose variability has been studied in detail .",
    "this allows us to estimate the impact of the inclination @xmath216 of the line emitting region on the black hole mass measurement and hence the factor @xmath202 , assuming pure disk motion of the gas .",
    "based on vlbi observations , alef et al.(1988 ) reported indications for super - luminal motion for 3c390.3 .",
    "further radio observations and a detailed analysis provided information on the inclination @xmath216 of the axis of the radio emission in 3c390.3 ( alef et al.1994,1998 ) , which was found to be @xmath217@xmath218 . the inclination of the radio axis of 3c390.3 has been also estimated based on x - ray observations ( eracleous et al.1996 ) .",
    "they successfully modeled the resolved fe k@xmath0 line emission with x - ray reprocessing in a cool , dense disk of gas at an inclination of @xmath219 .",
    "a third way to estimated the inclination of the disk - like line - emitting region is provided by fitting the double - peaked profile . using a relativistic keplerian disk eracleous & halpern ( 1994 ) derived an inclination angle of @xmath220@xmath221 .",
    "recently , flohic & eracleous ( 2008 ) analyzed the variations of the double - peaked profile shape of h@xmath0 for arp102b and 3c390.3 .",
    "they found that the best disk models for 3c390.3 strongly indicate an inclination angle of @xmath28 .    in a simple model of an accretion disk as the dominant source of the observed double - peaked emission - line profile ,",
    "the observed velocity is actually @xmath205 . assuming an inclination angle of @xmath222 this implies a correction factor of @xmath223 . within the uncertainties ,",
    "this factor is consistent with @xmath203 , determined by onken et al.(2004 ) and @xmath224 by gltekin et al.(2009 ) which were determined by comparing the reverberation - based black hole masses with the masses determined using the m@xmath196 relation , with the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath196 based on stellar or gas dynamics of the host galaxy s bulge .",
    "applying the correction due to the measured inclination of the accretion disk , the black hole mass of 3c390.3 based on the h@xmath0 and h@xmath12 rms spectrum profile properties and @xmath225 yields m@xmath226 .",
    "accretion disk models have been shown to be successful in explaining the observed profiles and even profile variations over longer time scales for 3c390.3 , thus , the typical velocity of the line emitting gas can be associated with the location of the blue and red peak of the double - peaked emission - line profile , i.e. , the location in velocity space of the dominant part of the line emitting gas . using the separation of the blue and red peak of the balmer emission - line profiles as @xmath200 , we estimated the virial product using eq.(4 ) and @xmath225 ( 80%  threshold level ) .",

    "however , this wide range is caused by the h@xmath2 based results which have a larger uncertainty than the black hole mass estimates obtained from the strong h@xmath0 and h@xmath12 emission lines which are consistent within the errors .",
    "since the rms spectrum represents the actual variable part of the emission line gas , we calculated the average virial black hole mass which is based on the rms spectra of the balmer emission lines h@xmath0 , h@xmath12 , and h@xmath2 .",

    "we applied the same iccf analysis to these light curves as we did for the measurements for this study .",
    "we found @xmath256days which is consistent with the results of sergeev et al . and",

    "next , we studied parts of the light curve which covered approximately 1000 days to study the impact of the luminosity state of 3c390.3 on the delay .",
    "we found delays of the broad h@xmath12 variations ranging from @xmath257days to @xmath258days with no clear relation between the continuum state and the delay .",
    "however , the mean spacing , especially for the h@xmath12 emission - line flux measurements , is only @xmath259days to @xmath260days , i.e. , probably not sufficient . only for the last three years of the light curve",
    "the temporal sampling is about @xmath109@xmath261days for the continuum and @xmath109@xmath262days for the h@xmath12 emission - line flux . for this period",

    "the h@xmath12 emission line flux measurements by sergeev et al.(2011 ) and by shapovalova et al.(2010 ) do overlap with our monitoring campaign .",
    "therefore , we can compare those with our h@xmath12 emission line light curve ( fig.18 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the continuum light curve follows the variations we measured while the coverage in h@xmath12 is not as high .    in the same way ,",
    "we re - analyzed the continuum and h@xmath12 emission - line light curves given by shapovalova et al.(2010 ) . for the entire data set which covers about 12.5 years",
    "we find @xmath264days , consistent with the results of sergeev et al .",
    "similar to the sergeev et al .",
    "data the light curves were split up into periods of about 1000 days duration with temporal sampling of about 40 days .",

    "has pointed out that variations on longer time scales , e.g. , on the dynamical time scale of the blr which is of the order of years , will shift the response time to longer delays .",
    "long term variations are different from direct reverberation signals which measure the instantaneous response of the emission - line gas to continuum variations , while long term variations trace a more gradual response to an overall increase or decrease of the continuum strength . to correct for this effect it is necessary to detrend light curves from those gradual changes . to detrend the continuum and h@xmath12 emission - line variations",
    ", we fit a low order polynomial to the light curves .",
    "next , we applied the analog time series analysis to the detrended light curves of the sergeev et al.(2002,2011 ) and shapovalova et al.(2010 ) studies .",
    "we derived time delays of the h@xmath12 variations of @xmath267days ( sergeev et al . ) and @xmath268days ( shapovalova et al . ) . within the uncertainties ( 1-@xmath196errors )",
    "these delays are consistent with those obtained with the original light curves .",
    "however , the uncertainties of the time delays using the detrented light curves are about a factor 2 to 3 smaller than those for the light curves including gradual long term variations .",
    "furthermore , the properties of continuum strength variations have a significant effect on the time delay measured from cross - correlation functions .",
    "this issue can be responsible for the different delays measured in our study and those using variations of the continuum and the broad emission lines over more than 10 years , in particular , the auto - correlation function of the continuum , acf@xmath269 .",
    "it has been already noted by sergeev et al.(2002,2011 ) that the width of the acf@xmath269 of the continuum light curve which is covering several years up to more than a decade is much broader than the acf@xmath269 of a shorter campaign like the one in 1994/95 and that this will result in a longer time delay ( see also the appendix for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "in addition , our campaign covered only a little more than 80 days and hence we are not able to measure time delays of about 100 days and more .",
    "we think that the different time delays are caused by the long time period of about a decade to cover the variation of 3c390.3 and the wider temporal sampling of the measurements .",
    "furthermore , the significantly different widths of the acf@xmath269 and the fact that in addition to reverberation signals , i.e. , the direct response of line emitting gas to continuum variations , also variations of the emission - line flux are included . these are associated with changes of the physical conditions and the distribution of the gas which happen on dynamical time scales and which are uncorrelated with continuum variability also contributes * to * the different time delays .",
    "therefore , a long duration campaign for 3c390.3 with densely sampled measurements will be necessary to find a definitive result .",
    "a wide range of mass estimates for the super - massive black hole of 3c390.3 have been reported , ranging from @xmath270 up to @xmath271 using emission line profile properties and estimates of the size of the blr ( e.g. , barr et al.1980 ; bentz et al.2009b ; clavel & wamsteker 1987 ; gaskell 1996 ; peterson et al.2004 ; sergeev et al.2002,2011 ; wamsteker et al.1997 ) , as well as using the caii  triplet in the near infrared employing the m@xmath21 relation yielding about m@xmath272 to @xmath273 @xmath274 ( nelson et al.2004 ) .",

    "under the assumption that the observed emission - line flux @xmath298 is the superposition of the response of the emission - line gas to continuum variations @xmath299 of gas with the same time - delay , which are related by the transfer function @xmath300 , the measured emission - line flux can be written as          as has been shown by penston ( 1991 ) , koratkar & gaskell ( 1991 ) , and peterson ( 1993,2000 ) .",
    "hence , the measured time delay depends on both the acf@xmath269 of the agn continuum and the transfer function @xmath300 .",
    "while the width of the acf@xmath269 at full - width - at - half maximum ( fwhm ) of the continuum variations studied by sergeev et al.(2002,2011 ) and shapovalova et al.(2010 ) amounts to about fwhm@xmath303days to 2000days , the fwhm of the continuum acf in our 2005 monitoring campaign is fwhm(acf@xmath269)@xmath304days , i.e. , about @xmath305 to @xmath306 times narrower . in the context of investigating the impact of variations on longer time scales and the necessity of detrending light curves for those trends to recover the time delay ,",
    "welsh ( 1999 ) mentioned that the points in the acf and ccf are highly correlated ( e.g. , jenkins & watts 1969 ) and that those correlations result in spurious large values of the ccf , especially for light curves which are characterized by intrinsically broad peaks .",
    "we suspect that the different time delays are predominantly caused by the significantly different widths of the acf@xmath269 ( cf . ,  5.1 ) .",
    "in addition , using the variations of the broad emission - line flux over times scales of the order of the dynamical time will include not only variations which are directly associated with continuum variations , i.e. , pure reverberation events , but will also include variations caused by changes in the distribution and conditions of the line emitting gas .",
    "those variations are manifested , for example , in emission - line profile changes which are uncorrelated with continuum variability , as shown by wanders & peterson ( 1996 ) .",
    "hence , including emission - line profile variability will dilute a reverberation signal , i.e. , the direct response of the gas on continuum variations .",
    "this aspect needs to be addressed when studying the relation of continuum and emission - line variability over time scales which are comparable or even longer than the dynamical time scale for an agn .",
    "based on the variability of ngc5548 which has currently the best covered spectroscopically variability history for the optical continuum and the broad h@xmath12 emission - line flux , it has been shown that the measured time delay is strongly correlated with the strength of the continuum , i.e. , whether the agn is in a high or low state .",
    "depending on the continuum luminosity , the delay of the h@xmath12 flux response to continuum variations varies between @xmath307days and @xmath308days ( bentz et al.2009b ; peterson et al.2002 ) . the continuum strength in the 13 years which were investigated in these studies varied by a factor of about @xmath74 .",
    "the light curves which were studied by sergeev et al.(2002,2011 ) and shapovalova et al.(2010 ) cover more than 10 years . during this time the strength of the continuum of 3c390.3 varied by a factor of nearly @xmath309 .",
    "finally , horne et al.(2004 ) have studied the impact of the duration of a monitoring campaign on the measured time delay .",
    "they provide a guide line for the optimal length of monitoring campaign depending on the brightness of an agn , to optimize also the use of telescope time .",
    "they found that a campaign should last at least about 3 times the light crossing time of the blr to recover the velocity resolved transfer function @xmath310 . in the case of cross - correlation functions , shorter campaigns can still yield reliable time delays , in particular if the light curve displays features of increasing and decreasing continuum and emission - line flux and not only a monotonic increase or decrease of the continuum and emission - line flux strength .",
