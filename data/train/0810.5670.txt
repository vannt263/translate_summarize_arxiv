    "it is of great interest to understand the mechanisms of quick equlibration of quark matter at rhic , indicated by the success of employing simple ideal hydrodynamics @xcite in describing the large values of the elliptic flow @xmath4 measured in au+au collisions @xcite .",
    "when the quark gluon matter becomes sufficiently dilute due to the strong longitudinal expansion pqcd , bremsstrahlung processes are essential for momentum isotropization@xcite .",
    "the importance of pqcd bremsstrahlung was first raised in the `` bottom - up '' scenario @xcite , which describes the thermal equilibration of a color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite characterized by a saturation scale @xmath3 .",
    "the main idea of the `` bottom - up '' scenario is that while the hard gluons with transverse momenta of order @xmath3 degrade as the condensate evolves in space time , soft gluons with transverse momenta much smaller than @xmath3 are populated due to pqcd @xmath5 bremsstrahlung and start to dominate the total gluon number .",
    "as soon as the radiated soft gluons achieve thermal equilibrium and build up a thermal bath , the hard ones begin to loose their energy to the thermal bath and subsequently thermalize .",
    "a parametric time scale for overall thermalization is given by @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "thermal equilibration of gluonic matter with an idealistic cgc initial condition in presence of pqcd @xmath7 processes is investigated in the present work for the first time within transport calculation using the parton cascade bamps @xcite . in this work",
    "we apply a one dimensional expanding geometry , which is adequate to the assumption of bjorken boost invariance @xcite . for the initial gluon distribution of cgc",
    "we employ an idealized and boost - invariant form @xcite @xmath8 , with @xmath9 for su(3 ) and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the initial gluons are produced at eigentime @xmath11 .",
    "this form of initial condition is a simplified form of cgc inspired by earlier studies in @xcite .",
    "particles with transverse momenta @xmath12 are missing here .",
    "their presence would modify the thermalization process , but as well lead to an even faster thermalization of the hard momentum region . including a more realistic distribution in the hard region of transverse spectrum is a task for future work .",
    "-0.5 cm    = 8.0 cm = 4.0 cm -0.25 cm    = 8.0 cm = 4.0 cm -0.25 cm    the way that thermalization proceeds within the parton cascade calculations does not resemble the `` bottom - up '' scenario @xcite .",
    "the strong parametric enhancement of the total gluon number at early times , as predicted by `` bottom - up '' scenario , is not observed in the cascade calculations .",
    "instead , gluon annihilation occurs during the first @xmath13 fm / c for @xmath14 gev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dndeta ] , which is due to domination of the @xmath15 processes at the early stage of evolution .",
    "this indicates that the initial cgc is oversaturated for the chosen values of @xmath16 and @xmath3 .",
    "the gluon number begins to increase after @xmath17 fm / c ( depending on the value of @xmath3 ) when the system is close to kinetic equilibrium and a quasi - hydrodynamical cooling sets in .",
    "after the expansion starts , energy flows immediately into both the soft ( @xmath18 gev ) and hard momentum region ( @xmath19 ) where the populations rapidly increase , as demonstrated in fig.[nnormpt_early](a ) for calculations with @xmath20 and @xmath21 gev .",
    "the presence of a thermal bath of soft gluons seems not to be a necessary condition for the equilibration of hard gluons , since they achieve an exponential shape on a short time scale and almost as quick as the soft gluons , as fig.[nnormpt_early](a ) demonstrates .",
    "again , this is different from the picture invoked in the `` bottom - up '' scenario .    at @xmath22",
    "the transverse spectrum looks almost thermal .",
    "after @xmath23 fm / c the cooling of the system sets in and the spectra evolve in a way , characteristic for a hydrodynamical expansion , as shown in fig.[nnormpt_early](b ) for @xmath24 .",
    "cm    = 11.0 cm = 4.5 cm -0.3 cm    = 5.0 cm = 4.5 cm -0.3 cm    we extract the time scale when the system is more or less thermalized from fig .",
    "[ temp ] , where the scaled effective temperature @xmath25 is shown .",
    "we define the time scale of thermalization as the time , at which @xmath25 becomes a constant , which corresponds to a one - dimensional ideal hydrodynamical expansion .",
    "the times extracted from fig .",
    "[ temp](constant @xmath26 ) read : @xmath27 ( resp . for @xmath28 ) . for fixed @xmath21 gev and various @xmath16",
    "the thermalization times are extracted in same manner : @xmath29 ( resp . for @xmath30 ) .    from the values",
    "presented here we observe that the time scale of thermalization is of order @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath31 scaling is consistent with the `` bottom - up '' result .",
    "the dependence on @xmath32 proves to be weaker than the `` bottom - up '' prediction but consistent with the scaling obtained in @xcite .",
    "the reason for the quick thermalization observed in our calculations is the gluon bremsstrahlung , which favors large - angle radiation due to the lpm suppression@xcite .",
    "thus , the pqcd @xmath7 processes are dominant for the thermal equilibration .",
    "the ideal hydrodynamic behavior of the system at late times indicates that the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density is small .",
    "figure [ etaovers ] shows the @xmath33 ratio in the calculations with @xmath20 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the shear viscosity is calculated using the navier - stokes approximation : @xmath37 .",
    "the entropy density is calculated by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the gluon density and @xmath40 denotes the gluon fugacity .",
    "the @xmath33 ratio is nearly constant and has a weak dependence on @xmath3 , @xmath41 , which is exactly the same as that obtained in full 3 + 1 dimensional bamps calculations with @xmath20 and minijets type initial conditions for au+au collisions at rhic energies @xcite .",
    "this verifies that the @xmath33 ratio determines the behavior of the late dynamics and , thus , depends only on the coupling @xmath16 , but not on initial conditions .",
    "the smallness of the @xmath33 ratio , which is close to the ads / cft lower bound@xcite , corresponds to the efficiency of the pqcd @xmath7 processes in thermal equilibration , because the @xmath33 ratio is inversely proportional to the total transport collision rate which is for @xmath7 processes @xmath42 times larger than that of @xmath43 collisions @xcite .",
    "using the parton cascade bamps , we found that several aspects of the real thermalization might be different compared to the `` bottom - up '' scenario . a strong increase in soft gluon number , as predicted in the `` bottom - up '' scenario ,",
    "is not observed and thermal equilibration of soft and hard gluons occurs roughly on the same time scale due to @xmath44 and @xmath15 processes , respectively . in agreement with the `` bottom - up '' scenario",
    ", the thermalization time proves to be proportional to @xmath45 , however , its proportionality to @xmath46 is not seen but is much weaker : @xmath47 .",
    "the differences arise because the back reactions of bremsstrahlung , @xmath15 processes , play a significant role .",
    "they are completely absent in the `` bottom - up '' scenario .    the quick thermalization and the smallness of the @xmath33 ratio observed in the present calculations with the cgc initial conditions are consistent with the findings from the previous studies @xcite using the glauber - type minijets initial conditions .",
    "this demonstrates that independent of the chosen initial conditions , the pqcd bremsstrahlung processes ( and the back reactions ) dominate the dynamical equilibration and then keep the system behaving like a nearly perfect fluid .",
