    "the feshbach projection operator ( fpo ) formalism  @xcite is a powerful method for the description of resonant scattering and reactions involving light nuclei @xcite . in recent years",
    "the fpo technique has been applied to numerous other systems like quantum dots and microwave cavities @xcite and atoms in a laser field @xcite . in its original formulation",
    ", the formalism is based on the introduction of projection operators  @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 , which project , respectively , onto the discrete states of a closed system and the continuous spectrum of a reservoir when their interaction is neglected .",
    "resonance states then naturally appear as bound states of the former closed system embedded into a continuum of open channels , due to the coupling really existing between the closed system and the reservoir . in other words :",
    "the starting point of the fpo formalism is the assumption that the scattering event is confined to a certain compact part of the available space @xcite .",
    "this region constitutes the so - called interaction region and can be described by the q subspace . outside this region ( in the p subspace )",
    "the interaction is absent so that the motion of scattering fragments depends ( apart from the total energy @xmath6 ) only on their internal states .",
    "each combination of internal states of all fragments is called a channel of reaction since it specifies a set of configurations ( depending on @xmath6 ) in which the system can be found long before and long after the scattering takes places .",
    "the fpo formalism exploits the concept of an effective hamiltonian @xmath7 to describe the open system resulting from the interaction between the idealized closed system and the reservoir .",
    "the operator @xmath7 is , naturally , non - hermitian and depends explicitly on energy .",
    "its complex eigenvalues @xmath8 are energy dependent .",
    "the solutions of the fixed - point equations for the eigenvalues provide approximately both energy positions and inverse lifetimes ( widths ) of resonance states @xcite . using the fpo formalism , an expression for the @xmath1 matrix",
    "can be derived @xcite .",
    "it contains the complex eigenvalues @xmath8 with their full energy dependence .",
    "the energy dependence is important especially in the neighborhood of decay thresholds and in the regime of overlapping resonances @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , analytic properties of the @xmath1 matrix are very sensitive to both the detailed form of the potential and the behavior of the potential at infinity . even at a point where the potential equals to zero with a computer precision",
    ", the truncation strongly affects the picture , especially the number of the @xmath1-matrix poles . in the simple case of the scattering by a potential of a compact support , i.e.",
    ", a potential vanishing outside a given cut off radius , the @xmath1 matrix has an infinite number of discrete poles in the lower part of the complex @xmath9 plane @xcite whereas an exponential asymptotic form of the potential can lead to a finite number of poles ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this means that for a truncated potential one obtains not only physical ( resonance ) @xmath1-matrix poles but also so - called cutoff poles  @xcite .",
    "these poles are not an artefact ; they are correct poles of the truncated potential but do not cause the characteristic phase shift by @xmath10 .",
    "therefore there is a need to distinguish between the two kinds of poles @xcite . one way to do so is to use the fact that the positions of the resonance poles are not affected by changing the model parameters such as , for instance , the cutoff radius . from a mathematical viewpoint",
    "both types of poles are correct but they have different origins .",
    "this is the reason why the problem of separation of cutoff poles from the resonance poles is widely discussed in the literature devoted to the @xmath1 matrix .    to the best of the authors knowledge",
    "the emergence of spurious complex eigenvalues has received little attention in the context of the fpo formalism @xcite .",
    "we think that the reason for that may reside in the fact that some authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) find the concept of the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian unsuitable in the case of potential scattering . in our opinion , however , the problem is not investigated in necessary details and the current paper is just devoted to fill in this gap .    to avoid unnecessary complications we apply , in the present paper , the fpo formalism to resonance scattering in its simplest form by considering only single - channel ( elastic ) @xmath11-wave scattering .",
    "in doing so we exclude the appearance of the feshbach ( core excited ) resonance states that are present in the general case ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus only potential ( shape ) resonances may appear in our approach .",
    "we assume the potential to have a finite number of resonance states and the continuous spectrum to fill the positive semiaxis resulting as solutions of the usual radial schrdinger equation .",
    "we construct exactly solvable potentials by applying the method of supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) @xcite to the inverse scattering problem ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . by exact solvability",
    "we mean the situation when solutions of the schrdinger equation are available in an explicit form and , in particular , are expressed in terms of elementary functions .",
    "it is the authors opinion that the potentials , the scattering data of which we set ourselves , represent a good testing ground for numerous schemes of resonance calculations .",
    "such calculations show the substantial relevance of the concept of the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian to resonance scattering on a finite range potential .",
    "we show that in this case the fpo formalism gives very accurate results both for the scattering phase shift and the positions and widths of physical resonances as well as for the cutoff poles of the scattering matrix .",
    "we discuss the fitness range of the fixed - point approximation and omit from our discussions the question of why the estimation of position and width of the resonance states by this method might be meaningful . in calculations for concrete reactions by using the fpo method ,",
    "this approximation is never used since the @xmath1 matrix contains the energy dependent functions  @xmath12 .",
    "it does _ not _ contain the energy - independent values that characterize the positions and widths of the resonance states and are obtained from , e.g. , the solutions of the fixed - point equations @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we determine the poles of the @xmath1 matrix exactly within the fpo formalism and compare them with the results of the exactly solvable potentials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we recall the methods of susy quantum mechanics in the context of scattering theory and construct bargmann - type potentials supporting resonance states . using the standard procedures of quantum scattering theory in sec .",
    "[ iii ] , we calculate the @xmath1-matrix poles for truncated bargmann - type potentials . in sec .",
    "[ iv ] , we write down the basic equations of fpo formalism used in the paper . our numerical scheme for the computation is mainly based on the consideration of quantum scattering on billiards with one attached lead @xcite .",
    "this model is formulated in the tight - binding approximation ( anderson model ) . in sec . [ nr ]",
    "we present numerical results obtained by using the two considered methods . in the last section",
    "some conclusions are drawn .",
    "as it is known , the susy approach , when restricted to the derivation of new exactly solvable quantum problems , is basically equivalent to the darboux transformation method ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "therefore we use susy and darboux transformations as synonyms .",
    "the whole class of potentials known as bargmann - type potentials ( see @xcite ) may be obtained from the zero potential with the help of either usual susy transformations or their confluent forms ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "typically , such a potential has an exponentially decreasing tail and supports a finite number of bound states and no resonances . its @xmath1 matrix ( as well as the jost function )",
    "is a rational function of the momentum @xmath9 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "any such potential may be obtained by a proper chain of susy transformations with _ real factorization constants _",
    "( see the next section for details ) .",
    "nevertheless , as it is shown in @xcite , the use of _ complex factorization constants _ in higher order transformations @xcite ( see also @xcite ) may lead to a real potential and corresponds to an irreducible supersymmetry .",
    "the use of such susy transformations permits us to enlarge the class of standard bargmann potentials by including potentials supporting resonance states .      in this section",
    "we shortly recall the definition and main properties of the darboux transformations method necessary for subsequent analysis .",
    "the interested reader can find a more detailed exposition elsewhere  @xcite .    in its pragmatic formulation",
    "the method essentially consists in getting solution @xmath13 of the ( transformed ) differential ( schrdinger ) equation @xmath14 by applying differential transformation operator @xmath15 of the form @xmath16 to a known solution @xmath17 of another ( initial ) equation @xmath18 @xmath19 , corresponding to the same value of the parameter @xmath6 . here",
    "the real - valued function @xmath20 called the superpotential is defined as the logarithmic derivative of a known solution to eq . denoted by @xmath21 @xmath22 with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the ground state energy of the hamiltonian @xmath25 if it has a discrete spectrum or the lower bound of the continuous spectrum otherwise .",
    "function @xmath21 is called the transformation or factorization function and @xmath26 is known as the factorization constant or factorization energy .",
    "the potential @xmath27 is defined in terms of the superpotential @xmath28 as @xmath29 the knowledge of all two - dimensional solution space of the initial equation with a given value of @xmath30 provides the knowledge of all solutions of the transformed equation corresponding to the same value of @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , if all solutions for @xmath6 belonging to the spectrum of @xmath25 are known ( so - called physical eigenfunctions of @xmath25 ) the method provides us with all physical eigenfunctions of @xmath31 .",
    "since the above procedure does not depend on a particular choice of the potential @xmath32 , the transformed hamiltonian @xmath31 can play the role of the initial hamiltonian for the next transformation step . in this way one gets a chain of exactly solvable hamiltonians",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath31 ,  , @xmath33 with the potentials @xmath32 , @xmath27 ,  , @xmath34 . to avoid any confusion we mention that everywhere , except for especially mentioned cases , we shall use subscripts to distinguish between quantities related to different hamiltonians , @xmath25 , @xmath31 ,   and shall omit them when discussing general properties regarding all hamiltonians .",
    "first - order darboux transformation operator  @xmath35 , as defined by eq . , relates solutions of two hamiltonians @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "if one is not interested in the intermediate hamiltonians @xmath31 ,  , @xmath38 and",
    "all factorization energies are chosen to be different from each other , the whole chain may be replaced by a single transformation given by an @xmath39th - order transformation operator , denoted by @xmath40 , defined as a superposition of @xmath39 first - order transformation operators . a compact representation of this operator is given by @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a solution to eq .",
    "corresponding to the energy @xmath43 and @xmath44 satisfies @xmath45 the transformation functions @xmath46 , although labeled by a subscript , are eigenfunctions of the initial hamiltonian @xmath47 these should be chosen in a way that the wronskian  @xmath48 is nodeless and either real or purely imaginary for @xmath49 .",
    "these conditions guarantee the absence of singularities in the potential @xmath50 defining the hamiltonian @xmath33 of eq . and its real character for @xmath51 . in particular , factorization constants should be either real or come in complex conjugate pairs with corresponding factorization solutions being either real or in pairs complex conjugate to each other .",
    "formula is valid for any @xmath43 except for @xmath52 @xmath53 . for these values of  @xmath9",
    "the corresponding solutions are @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath56st order wronskian constructed from @xmath57 except for @xmath46 , @xmath58 .",
    "let us choose the following set @xcite of eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath25 as transformation functions for the darboux transformation of order @xmath59 : @xmath60 @xmath61 here @xmath26 s and @xmath62 s should be different from each other and chosen in a way that the corresponding factorization energies , if they are real , are smaller than the ground state energy of @xmath25 when it has a discrete spectrum , or less than the lower bound of the continuous spectrum otherwise .",
    "no such restrictions are imposed on @xmath26 s and @xmath62 s for complex factorization energies .",
    "we distinguish between the functions @xmath21 and @xmath63 from their behavior at the origin .",
    "the functions @xmath63 are regular , @xmath64 , and hence are uniquely defined up to a constant factor , that is not essential for our purpose .",
    "the functions @xmath46 are irregular at the origin , @xmath65 , and form the so - called singular family .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the chain of transformations with transformation functions transforms the initial jost function @xmath66 of hamiltonian @xmath25 to the jost function , @xmath67 corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath33 . since the jost function should be analytic in the upper half of the complex @xmath9 plane ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) all @xmath68 s must be real and positive .",
    "this avoids the appearance of the so - called redundant poles , which occur as poles of the jost function or zeros of the @xmath1 matrix .",
    "every purely imaginary @xmath69 with @xmath70 corresponds to a discrete level @xmath71 of @xmath33 .",
    "no restriction , except the ones discussed above , is imposed on @xmath26 s .",
    "complex @xmath26 s coming in pairs with real parts of opposite signs may correspond to a visible resonance .",
    "thus , we say that every pair of complex numbers @xmath72+i\\mbox{im}\\left[\\alpha_j\\right]$ ] corresponds to a resonance and to mirror resonance states with complex energy , @xmath73 +      i\\mbox{im}\\left[\\alpha_j\\right]\\right)^2=\\\\      \\left (      \\mbox{re}\\left[\\alpha_j\\right]^2-      \\mbox{im}\\left[\\alpha_j\\right]^2\\right)\\pm      2i\\mbox{re}\\left[\\alpha_j\\right]\\mbox{im}\\left[\\alpha_j\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case , in accordance with the analytic properties of the jost function , the technique developed in  @xcite remains stable for @xmath74<0 $ ] , and @xmath75<0 $ ] .",
    "states with @xmath76|>|\\mbox{im}\\left[\\alpha_j\\right]|$ ] correspond to visible resonances provided @xmath74 ^ 2- \\mbox{im}\\left[\\alpha_j\\right]^2 $ ] is small enough  @xcite .    in the one - channel case",
    "the @xmath1 matrix is a single - valued function of wave number @xmath9 , @xmath77 in our approach @xmath78 differs from @xmath66 by a rational function of momentum @xmath9 .",
    "therefore the expression for phase shift @xmath79 becomes rather complicated when the number of transformation functions is sufficiently large .",
    "an alternative expression , which is more convenient for practical calculations , is @xcite @xmath80 in sect . [ nr ]",
    "we apply the above described technique to obtain potentials with either one or two resonance states .",
    "moreover , since our starting potential equals zero , when the usual technique of darboux transformations @xcite reproduces bargmann potentials @xcite , the potentials from sec .",
    "[ nr ] are their generalizations to describe resonance scattering .",
    "below we will denote them by @xmath81 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the solutions of the schrdinger equation for these potentials are expressed in terms of elementary ( trigonometric ) functions .",
    "in order to compare the results obtained by means of the fpo technique and those obtained by the darboux method we investigate the scattering on truncated bargmann potentials @xmath82 , i.e. on potentials equal to bargmann potentials @xmath81 for @xmath83 , and equal to zero for @xmath84 . in this case",
    ", as it is well known , the analytic continuation of @xmath85 to the complex @xmath9 plane is a meromorphic function with infinitely many poles . in order to calculate their positions and widths we use the methods of usual quantum scattering theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    for @xmath84 , where @xmath86 , the solution of schrdinger equation is a linear combination of plane waves , which we write as @xmath87 we denote the phase shift for the truncated potential as @xmath88 .",
    "the phase shift @xmath88 is obtained by solving eq . for function @xmath89 in the region @xmath83 and matching it to have form at @xmath90 .",
    "function @xmath89 subject to the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath91 , is uniquely defined ( up to an inessential constant factor ) .",
    "although at @xmath90 both @xmath92 and @xmath93 must be continuous , it is sufficient for our purposes to impose continuity on the logarithmic derivative ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath94_{r = r_{cut } } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left[\\frac{1}{\\psi_{r\\geq r_{cut}}}\\frac{d\\psi_{r\\geq r_{cut}}}{dr}\\right]_{r = r_{cut}}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is independent of a multiplicative constant .",
    "from here we find the phase shift of the cutoff potential @xmath95=\\frac{k\\cos\\left(kr_{cut}\\right)-\\gamma\\sin\\left(kr_{cut}\\right ) }      { k\\sin\\left(kr_{cut}\\right)+\\gamma\\cos\\left(kr_{cut}\\right)}\\ ] ] which , upon using eq .",
    ", gives its @xmath1 matrix @xmath96 the poles of @xmath97 are the roots of the transcendental equation @xmath98 which we solve numerically in sec .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , in the fpo formalism @xcite the full function space is divided into two subspaces : the @xmath2 subspace contains all wave functions that are localized inside the idealized closed system and vanish outside of it while the wave functions of the @xmath3 subspace are extended up to infinity and vanish inside the system ; see @xcite .",
    "this division is carried out by using the projection operators @xmath2 and  @xmath3 ( @xmath99 , @xmath5 ) .",
    "the wave functions of the two subspaces can be obtained by standard methods : the @xmath2 subspace is described by eigenfunctions of hermitian hamiltonian @xmath100 that characterizes the localized closed system with a discrete spectrum , while the @xmath3 subspace is described by the states of hermitian hamiltonian @xmath101 , which has a continuous spectrum . in the fpo formalism , the closed system becomes open because of a really existing coupling between the localized closed system and the reservoir , i.e. , because of the coupling between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 subspaces . due to this coupling , some discrete states of the closed system",
    "become resonance states of the open system which , in general , have finite life times .    in the present paper we are interested , above all , in the properties of the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian of the open quantum system , which acts on the @xmath2 subspace and carries the influence of the @xmath3 subspace .",
    "it reads @xmath102 here , @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "further , @xmath105 and  @xmath106 stand for the coupling operators between the @xmath2 subspace ( described by @xmath100 ) and the @xmath3 subspace ( environment , described by @xmath101 ) . the operator @xmath7 is non - hermitian and describes the localized system under the influence of the reservoir @xcite .",
    "the non - hermitian operator @xmath7 is complex - symmetric and depends explicitly on energy .",
    "its eigenvalues @xmath8 and eigenfunctions @xmath107 , @xmath108 are complex .",
    "the eigenvalues provide not only the energies of the resonance states but also their widths .",
    "the eigenfunctions are biorthogonal . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we underline here that values like the @xmath1 matrix and the cross section are independent of the manner how the @xmath2 and @xmath3 subspaces are defined .",
    "however , in order to obtain the positions @xmath109 and widths @xmath110 of the resonance states from the eigenvalues @xmath8 of @xmath0 , the two subspaces have to be defined properly . otherwise , the @xmath8 have nothing in common with the spectroscopic values @xmath111 of the resonance states .",
    "this can be seen , e.g. , from the fact that @xmath112 if @xmath113 .    using the fpo formalism ,",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath1 can be written in terms of the effective hamiltonian and the external scattering states @xmath114 defined by @xmath115 .",
    "it reads @xcite @xmath116 characteristic of eq .",
    "is that it contains @xmath7 with its explicit energy dependence .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath7 plays an important role near decay thresholds and in the regime of overlapping resonances .",
    "the @xmath1 matrix is always unitary .",
    "the fpo formalism may formally be considered as a certain generalization of the @xmath117 matrix approach @xcite . in both cases , the wave functions of the system are localized in coordinate space ( @xmath2 subspace in the fpo formalism ) and coupled to an extended continuum of scattering wave functions ( @xmath3 subspace in the fpo formalism ) .",
    "however , the standard spectroscopic parameters of the @xmath117 matrix approach do not contain any feedback from the continuum of scattering wave functions . in the fpo formalism , they are replaced by the energy - dependent functions @xmath109 and @xmath110 in which the feedback from the continuum is involved .",
    "we examine the concept of the effective hamiltonian in connection with the potential scattering on spherically symmetric potentials . in order to define the @xmath2 subspace that contains the localized part of the problem",
    ", we truncate the potential at a certain cutoff radius @xmath118 .",
    "the @xmath3 subspace is defined then by the remaining part of the function space being extended up to infinity .",
    "the operators @xmath119 describe the coupling between the two subspaces . in this paper",
    ", we consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum system to which one lead is attached at a certain point .",
    "we will describe such a system in the framework of the tight - binding approach .",
    "let us consider the resonance scattering on truncated bargmann potentials @xmath82 as described in secs .",
