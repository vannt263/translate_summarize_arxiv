    "resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) experiments tuned for the cu @xmath1 edge have provided a lot of new insights about spin dynamics of the spin - flip channel in cuprate superconductors when incident photon has the @xmath2 polarization  @xcite .",
    "the non - spin - flip channel involving charge dynamics as well as two - magnon excitations can be predominantly detected by @xmath3 polarization for the incident photon .",
    "not only polarization dependence but also incident - photon energy @xmath0 dependence of the rixs spectrum gives us useful information on the electronic states of cuprates .",
    "experimentally it has been reported that the @xmath0 dependence for the @xmath2-polarized incident photon gives a raman - like behavior independent of @xmath0 , while the @xmath3 polarization induces a fluorescencelike shift of spectral weight with increasing @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "theoretically it has been pointed out that the @xmath0 dependence is sensitive to particle - hole excitations of quasiparticles  @xcite depending on band structures of materials  @xcite . on the other hand , a model calculation for the doped - mott insulator , i.e.",
    ", a calculation of the single - band hubbard model , has also captured raman - like and fluorescencelike behaviors  @xcite : the raman - like excitation comes from collective spin excitations , while the fluorescencelike shift is due to the continuum of particle - hole excitations .    in the fluorescence of the normal x - ray emission spectroscopy ( xes ) , there is no correlation between a photoexcited electron in the vacuum continuum and a valence electron decaying into the core hole so that the emission spectrum is almost independent of @xmath0 .",
    "then the energy loss of the x ray increases as @xmath0 increases . in the present rixs , however ,",
    "the fluorescencelike behavior would come from a different origin  @xcite since these electrons are rather correlated .",
    "the intermediate state of the rixs process contains a core hole created by an incident photon .",
    "therefore , the coulomb interaction between the core hole and valence electron ( @xmath4 electron in cuprates ) acting in the intermediate state influences the rixs spectrum .",
    "it is thus expected that the core - hole coulomb interaction also affects the @xmath0 dependence of the rixs spectrum .    in this paper",
    ", we perform the lanczos - type exact diagonalization calculation of the rixs spectrum for the single - band hubbard model describing hole- and electron - doped cuprates . examining the @xmath0 dependence of non - spin - flip rixs spectra , we find that the dependence is strongly affected by the value of core - hole coulomb interaction in hole doping : a @xmath0-dependent fluorescencelike behavior appears when the core - hole coulomb interaction is larger than the on - site coulomb interaction in the hubbard model , while a @xmath0-independent raman - like behavior appears for smaller core - hole coulomb interaction although the distribution of spectral weight depends on @xmath0 .",
    "analyzing main and satellite structures in x - ray absorption ( xas ) for hole doping , we find that it is reasonable to take the core - hole coulomb interaction larger than the on - site coulomb interaction in modeling rixs by a single - band model of cuprates .",
    "this suggests a fluorescence - like behavior in rixs for the @xmath3-polarized geometry detecting non - spin - flip excitations , being consistent with recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the dynamical charge structure factor is observed through @xmath3-polarized rixs by tuning @xmath0 to a satellite structure in xas for hole doping .    using the larger core - hole coulomb interaction , we predict a shift on the high - energy side of the center of spectral distribution in electron doping , which has not yet been observed experimentally . in the spin - flip channel ,",
    "main structures exhibit a raman - like behavior as expected .",
    "in addition , there is a fluorescencelike behavior similar to the non - spin - flip channel , although spectral weight is very small .",
    "the behavior is enhanced with increasing hole carriers . a detailed experimental work to detect these behaviors",

    "<S> we theoretically investigate the incident - photon energy @xmath0 dependence of resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) tuned for the cu @xmath1 edge in cuprate superconductors by using the exact diagonalization technique for a single - band hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the value of core - hole coulomb interaction in the intermediate state , rixs for non - spin - flip channel shows either a @xmath0-dependent fluorescencelike or @xmath0-independent raman - like behavior for hole doping . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of x - ray absorption suggests that the core - hole coulomb interaction is larger than on - site coulomb interaction in the hubbard model , resulting in a fluorescence - like behavior in rixs consistent with recent rixs experiments . </S>",
    "<S> a shift on the high - energy side of the center of spectral distribution is also predicted for electron - doped systems though spectral weight is small . </S>",
    "<S> main structures in the spin - flip channel exhibit a raman - like behavior as expected , accompanied with a fluorescencelike behavior with small intensity . </S>"
