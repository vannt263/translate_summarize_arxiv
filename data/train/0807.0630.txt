    "the fact that for some physical systems all bound classical orbits are closed leads to accidental degeneracies in the discrete energy spectrum of the corresponding quantum systems .",
    "accidental symmetries are familiar from a particle moving in a @xmath0 or @xmath1 potential . in @xmath5",
    "spatial dimensions the system then has an @xmath6 rotational symmetry . in case of the @xmath0 potential , this symmetry is dynamically enhanced to an accidental @xmath7 symmetry , and for the @xmath1 harmonic oscillator potential it is enhanced to @xmath8 .",
    "the accidental symmetries give rise to additional degeneracies in the discrete energy spectrum of the corresponding quantum systems , beyond the degeneracies one would expect based on rotation invariance alone @xcite .",
    "the components of the runge - lenz vector @xcite are the generators of the accidental symmetry algebras .",
    "the subject of accidental symmetry has been reviewed , for example , by mcintosh @xcite .",
    "recently , we have further investigated the phenomenon of accidental symmetries , by studying a particle confined to the surface of a cone and bound to its tip by a @xmath0 or @xmath1 potential @xcite .",
    "when the deficit angle of the cone is a rational fraction of @xmath9 , again all bound classical orbits are closed and there are accidental degeneracies in the energy spectrum of the quantum system . in this case",
    "the runge - lenz vector does not act as a self - adjoint operator in the domain of the hamiltonian .",
    "remarkably , as a consequence of this unusual property , the accidental @xmath10 symmetry has unusual multiplets with fractional ( i.e.  neither integer nor half - integer ) spin .",
    "an interesting example of an accidental symmetry involving a vector potential is cyclotron motion @xcite .",
    "also in this case , there is a deep connection between the fact that all bound classical orbits are closed and additional degeneracies in the discrete energy spectrum of the corresponding quantum system . as was already noted in @xcite , the center of the circular cyclotron orbit",
    "is a conserved quantity analogous to the runge - lenz vector in the kepler problem .",
    "also the radius of the cyclotron orbit is a conserved quantity directly related to the energy .",
    "interestingly , while the two coordinates of the center are not simultaneously measurable , the radius of the circle has a sharp value in an energy eigenstate . in the cyclotron problem ,",
    "translation invariance disguises itself as an `` accidental '' symmetry . as a consequence , the symmetry multiplets  i.e.  the landau levels",
    " are infinitely degenerate . in order to further investigate the nature of the accidental symmetry , in @xcite",
    "the charged particle in the magnetic field was coupled to the origin by an @xmath1 harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "this explicitly breaks translation invariance and thus reduces the degeneracy to a finite amount , while rotation invariance remains intact . in this paper , we do the opposite , i.e.  we explicitly break rotation invariance , while leaving translation invariance ( and hence the accidental symmetry ) intact by putting the system on a torus .",
    "interestingly , the polyakov loops , which are a consequence of the non - trivial holonomies of the torus , give rise to non - trivial aharonov - bohm phases which are observable at the quantum but not at the classical level .",
    "analogous to the quantum mechanical breaking of cp invariance due to the @xmath2-vacuum angle in non - abelian gauge theories , here two self - adjoint extension parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 explicitly break the continuous translation invariance of the classical problem down to a discrete magnetic translation group @xcite .",
    "this reduces the degeneracy to a finite amount , and allows us to further investigate the nature of the accidental symmetry . in particular , just like for motion on a cone @xcite , symmetry manifests itself in a rather unusual way in this quantum system . in particular , due to its relevance to the quantum hall effect , the landau level problem has been studied very extensively ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . for example , the problem has already been investigated on a torus in @xcite , however , without emphasizing the accidental symmetry aspects . in this paper , we concentrate entirely on those aspects , thus addressing an old and rather well - studied problem from an unconventional point of view .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the cyclotron problem is reviewed in the infinite volume , with special emphasis on its oscillator algebras and accidental symmetry generators . in section 3",
    "the system is put on a torus and the unusual manifestation of the accidental symmetry is worked out .",
    "section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "in this section we review the standard knowledge about a non - relativistic particle moving in a constant magnetic field in the infinite volume . we proceed from a classical to a semi - classical , and finally to a fully quantum mechanical treatment . in particular , we emphasize the symmetry aspects of the problem with a focus on accidental symmetries .",
    "this section is a preparation for the case of a finite periodic volume to be discussed in the next section . in the following",
    ", we will use natural units in which @xmath11 .      ignoring its spin",
    ", we consider a non - relativistic electron of mass @xmath12 and electric charge @xmath13 moving in a constant magnetic field @xmath14 , which we realize through the vector potential @xmath15 since the motion along the direction of the magnetic field is trivial , we restrict ourselves to 2-dimensional motion in the @xmath16-@xmath17-plane .",
    "obviously , this is just standard cyclotron motion .",
    "to get started , in this subsection we treat the problem classically .",
    "the particle then experiences the lorentz force @xmath18 which forces the particle on a circular orbit of some radius @xmath19 .",
    "it moves along the circle with an angular velocity @xmath20 , which implies the linear velocity @xmath21 and the acceleration @xmath22 .",
    "hence , newton s equation takes the form @xmath23 with the cyclotron frequency @xmath20 being independent of the radius @xmath19 .",
    "obviously , for this system all classical orbits are closed .",
    "the same is true for a particle moving in a @xmath0 or @xmath1 potential . in those cases ,",
    "the fact that all bound classical orbits are closed is related to the conservation of the runge - lenz vector which generates a hidden accidental dynamical symmetry .",
    "let us now investigate the question of accidental symmetry for the particle in the constant magnetic field .",
    "the lagrange function then takes the form @xmath24 and the corresponding conjugate momenta are @xmath25 first of all , in the gauge that we picked , @xmath17 is a cyclic coordinate and hence the canonically conjugate momentum @xmath26 is conserved as a consequence of translation invariance in the @xmath17-direction . despite the fact that the system is translation invariant also in the @xmath16-direction , @xmath16 itself is not a cyclic coordinate and hence @xmath27 is not conserved . still , using noether s theorem one can identify the corresponding conserved quantity as @xmath28 .",
    "interestingly , the lagrange function is not invariant under a shift in the @xmath16-direction but changes by a total derivative ( which leaves the classical equations of motion unchanged ) .",
    "the classical hamilton function takes the form @xmath29 ^ 2 = \\frac{1}{2 m}\\left[p_x^2 + \\left(p_y + e b x\\right)^2\\right].\\ ] ] it is straightforward to convince oneself that @xmath30 has vanishing poisson brackets , @xmath31 , with the three symmetry generators @xmath32 one can identify @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 as the gauge - covariant generators of translations and rotations . in particular , one obtains @xmath36 as one would expect for the rotation properties of the vector @xmath37 .",
    "as is well - known , however , in a magnetic field the two translations @xmath33 and @xmath34 do not commute , i.e. @xmath38 how can these standard symmetry considerations be related to an accidental symmetry due to a runge - lenz vector ?",
    "the runge - lenz vector is familiar from the kepler problem .",
    "it points from the center of force to the perihelion position , and is conserved because all bound classical orbits are closed .",
    "similarly , the orbit of a charged particle in a constant magnetic field is a closed circle with a fixed center .",
    "indeed , in this case the position of this center plays the role of the conserved runge - lenz vector and is given by @xmath39 interestingly , the position @xmath40 of the center of the cyclotron circle is , at the same time , proportional to @xmath41 , i.e.  it is orthogonal to the generators of spatial translations .",
    "consequently , we can write @xmath42 as well as @xmath43 while eqs.([poisson1 ] ) and ( [ poisson2 ] ) look like the usual poisson brackets of position and momentum , one should not forget that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are just multiples of @xmath34 and @xmath33 , and should hence not be mistaken as independent variables .",
    "in particular , one also obtains the relation @xmath46 hence , just like the two generators of translations , the @xmath16- and @xmath17-components of the runge - lenz vector do not have a vanishing poisson bracket .",
    "at the quantum level , this will imply that the @xmath16- and @xmath17-components of the center of a cyclotron circle are not simultaneously measurable with absolute precision .",
    "another conserved quantity is the radius @xmath19 of the circular cyclotron orbit which can be expressed as @xmath47 since @xmath1 is proportional to the energy , it obviously is indeed conserved .",
    "next , we consider the same problem semi - classically , i.e.  by using bohr - sommerfeld quantization , which , in this case , is equivalent to the quantization of angular momentum , i.e.  @xmath48 . for a cyclotron orbit of radius @xmath19 , it is easy to convince oneself that @xmath49 consequently , in the semi - classical treatment the allowed radii of cyclotron orbits are now quantized . using eq.([hamiltonian ] ) one finds for the energy @xmath50 as is well - known , up to a constant @xmath51 , the semi - classically quantized energy values are those of a harmonic oscillator with the cyclotron frequency @xmath20 .",
    "finally , we consider the problem fully quantum mechanically .",
    "the schrdinger equation then takes the form @xmath52 \\psi(\\vec x ) = e \\psi(\\vec x).\\ ] ] we now make the factorization ansatz @xmath53 and we obtain @xmath54   \\psi(x ) = e \\psi(x).\\ ] ] indeed , this is the schrdinger equation of a shifted harmonic oscillator .",
    "hence , the quantum mechanical energy spectrum takes the form @xmath55 interestingly , the energy of the charged particle is completely independent of the transverse momentum @xmath26 . as a result ,",
    "the quantized landau levels have a continuous infinite degeneracy .",
    "the energy eigenstates are shifted one - dimensional harmonic oscillator wave functions @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 similarly , one can construct eigenstates of the generator @xmath58 of infinitesimal translations ( up to a gauge transformation ) in the @xmath16-direction @xmath59 it is straightforward to show that the two sets of eigenstates @xmath60 and @xmath61 span the same subspace of localized states in the hilbert space .    since all classical orbits are closed and the center of the cyclotron orbit plays the role of a runge - lenz vector , it is natural to ask whether the degeneracy is caused by an accidental symmetry .",
    "of course , since the runge - lenz vector plays a dual role and is also generating translations ( up to gauge transformations ) , in this case the `` accidental '' symmetry would just be translation invariance .",
    "indeed , in complete analogy to the classical case , it is easy to convince oneself that @xmath62 = [ h , r_y ] = [ h , l ] = 0 $ ] , with the runge - lenz vector and the angular momentum operator given by @xmath63 as in the classical case , the radius of the cyclotron orbit squared is given by @xmath64 and is thus again a conserved quantity .",
    "in particular , we can express the hamiltonian as @xmath65 remarkably , although the two coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the center of the cyclotron circle are not simultaneously measurable , its radius @xmath19 has a definite value in an energy eigenstate .",
    "as it should , under spatial rotations the runge - lenz vector @xmath40 indeed transforms as a vector , i.e. @xmath66 = i r_y , \\ [ l , r_y ] = - i r_x.\\ ] ] these relations suggest to introduce @xmath67 which implies @xmath68 = \\pm r_\\pm.\\ ] ] hence , @xmath69 and @xmath70 act as raising and lowering operators of angular momentum .",
    "still , it is important to note that @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath35 do not form an @xmath10 algebra .",
    "this follows because , in analogy to the classical case @xmath71 = \\frac{i}{e b},\\ ] ] i.e.  @xmath44 and @xmath45 are generators of a heisenberg algebra . as a consequence one obtains @xmath72 = \\frac{2}{e b}.\\ ] ]",
    "since the particle in the magnetic field leads to the spectrum of a 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator ( however , with infinite degeneracy ) , it is natural to ask how one can construct corresponding creation and annihilation operators such that @xmath73 = 1.\\ ] ] remarkably , the creation and annihilation operators are closely related to the runge - lenz vector , i.e.  the vector that points to the center of the classical cyclotron orbit . since we have seen that @xmath74,\\ ] ] one is led to identify @xmath75 , \\",
    "a^\\dagger = \\sqrt{\\frac{m \\omega}{2 } } \\left[x - r_x + i ( y - r_y)\\right],\\ ] ] which indeed have the desired properties .",
    "one also finds that @xmath76 = - a , \\ [ l , a^\\dagger ] = a^\\dagger,\\ ] ] which implies that @xmath77 and @xmath78 also raise and lower the angular momentum .",
    "interestingly , we have seen before that @xmath68 = \\pm r_\\pm , \\ [ r_+,r_- ] = \\frac{2}{e b } = \\frac{2}{m \\omega}.\\ ] ] hence , @xmath69 and @xmath70 also act as raising and lowering operators of the angular momentum . indeed",

    "it is straightforward to derive the commutation relations @xmath83 = [ a^\\dagger , b ] = [ a , b^\\dagger ] = [ a^\\dagger , b^\\dagger ] = 0 , \\",
    "[ b , b^\\dagger ] = 1.\\ ] ] interestingly , just like a 2-dimensional harmonic oscillator , the particle in a magnetic field is described by two sets of commuting creation and annihilation operators . however , in contrast to the 2-dimensional harmonic oscillator , the hamiltonian of the particle in a magnetic field contains only @xmath84 , but not @xmath85 .",
    "interestingly , the hamiltonian can also be expressed as @xmath86 here we have introduced the hamiltonian of an ordinary 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator @xmath87 and the angular momentum operator has been identified as @xmath88 interestingly , the creation and annihilation operators @xmath82 and @xmath81 commute with the total energy @xmath30 because they raise ( lower ) @xmath89 by @xmath20 , while they lower ( raise ) @xmath35 by 1 , such that indeed @xmath90 = [ h_0,b ] + \\omega [ l , b ] = 0 , \\ [ h , b^\\dagger ] = [ h_0,b^\\dagger ] + \\omega [ l , b^\\dagger ] = 0.\\ ] ]      since the algebraic structure of the problem ( but not the exact form of the hamiltonian ) is the same as for the 2-dimensional harmonic oscillator , we can construct the physical states accordingly .",
    "first of all , we construct a state @xmath91 that is annihilated by both @xmath78 and @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath92 then we define states @xmath93 which are eigenstates of the total energy @xmath94 as well as of the angular momentum @xmath95 it should be noted that the quantum number @xmath96 ( which determines the energy ) is non - negative , while the quantum number @xmath97 ( which determines the angular momentum ) is an arbitrary integer .",
    "the infinite degeneracy of the landau levels is now obvious because states with the same @xmath98 but different values of @xmath99 have the same energy .",
    "one may wonder why in subsection 2.3 we found an infinite degeneracy labeled by the continuous momentum @xmath26 and now we only find a countable variety of degenerate states ( labeled by the integer @xmath100 ) .",
    "this apparent discrepancy is due to the implicit consideration of two different hilbert spaces .",
    "while the states in the discrete variety labeled by @xmath100 are normalizable in the usual sense , the continuous variety of plane wave states labeled by @xmath26 is normalized to @xmath101-functions and thus belongs to an extended hilbert space .",
    "it is remarkable that a quantum mechanical system containing just a single particle has an even infinitely degenerate ground state .",
    "the existence of infinitely degenerate ground states is usually associated with the spontaneous breakdown of a continuous global symmetry in systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom .",
    "does the infinite degeneracy of the single - particle landau levels have anything to do with the spontaneous breakdown of translation invariance ?",
    "the usual breaking of a continuous global symmetry is associated with the occurrence of massless goldstone bosons .",
    "for example , when translation invariance is spontaneously broken by the formation of a crystal lattice , phonons arise as massless excitations . in the quantum mechanical system",
    "studied here , there is no room for phonons because it has only a finite number of degrees of freedom . indeed , the infinitely degenerate ground states are separated from the rest of the spectrum by a gap @xmath20 .",
    "still , just like a system with spontaneous symmetry breaking , the charged particle in a magnetic field may chose spontaneously from a continuous variety of degenerate ground states .",
    "coherent states are well - known from the harmonic oscillator , and have also been constructed for the landau level problem @xcite . as usual , the coherent states are constructed as eigenstates of the annihilation operators , i.e. @xmath102 in coordinate space , the coherent states can be expressed as @xmath103.\\ ] ] some expectation values in the coherent state @xmath104 are given by @xmath105 here @xmath106 describes the quantum uncertainty . in all cases",
    "@xmath107 is proportional to @xmath108 or @xmath109 , which implies that the relative uncertainty goes to zero in the classical limit .    just as in the ordinary harmonic oscillator ,",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath110 with an initial coherent state @xmath111 is ( up to an irrelevant phase ) solved by @xmath112 with @xmath113 as expected , the state remains coherent during its time - evolution .",
    "in particular , this implies @xmath114 hence , the coherent state represents a gaussian wave packet moving around a circular cyclotron orbit just like a classical particle .",
    "this is obvious from the coordinate representation of the probability density @xmath115\\right ) , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\langle x \\rangle(t ) = \\langle r_x \\rangle +   \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m \\omega } } |\\lambda| \\cos(\\omega t ) , \\",
    "\\langle y \\rangle(t ) = \\langle r_y \\rangle +   \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m \\omega } } |\\lambda| \\sin(\\omega t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is interesting to note that the coherent states @xmath116 with @xmath117 ( but with arbitrary @xmath118 form an overcomplete set of degenerate ground states with the energy @xmath119 .",
    "these states represent gaussian wave packets centered at the points @xmath120 determined by @xmath121 . unlike for a free particle , these gaussian wave packets do not spread .",
    "semi - classically speaking , the charged particle is in a `` circular orbit '' of quantized sharp radius @xmath122 with an uncertain position @xmath120 of the center . since the ground state is infinite degenerate , the charged particle can spontaneously select any average position @xmath120 at which it can stay with average velocity zero in a state of minimal uncertainty . again , this is reminiscent of the spontaneous breakdown of translation invariance .",
    "in this section we put the problem in a finite periodic volume .",
    "this explicitly breaks rotation invariance , but leaves translation invariance intact ( at least at the classical level ) , and leads to an energy spectrum with finite degeneracy . in order to clarify some subtle symmetry properties",
    ", we also discuss issues of hermiticity versus self - adjointness of various operators .",
    "in this subsection we impose a torus boundary condition over a rectangular region of size @xmath123 .",
    "this will lead to a quantization condition for the magnetic flux .",
    "since the magnetic field is constant , it obviously is periodic . on the other hand ,",
    "the vector potential of the infinite volume theory @xmath124 , @xmath125 obeys the conditions @xmath126 as a gauge - dependent quantity , the vector potential is periodic only up to gauge transformations , i.e. @xmath127 the gauge transformations @xmath128 and @xmath129 are transition functions in a fiber bundle which specify the boundary condition . in our case",
    "the transition functions are given by @xmath130    besides the field strength , gauge theories on a periodic volume possess additional gauge invariant quantities  the so - called polyakov loops  which arise due to the non - trivial holonomies of the torus .",
    "for an abelian gauge theory the polyakov loops are defined as @xmath131 in our case , they are given by @xmath132    in order to respect gauge invariance of the theory on the torus , under shifts the wave function must also be gauge transformed accordingly @xmath133 the angles @xmath3 and @xmath4 parametrize a family of self - adjoint extensions of the hamiltonian on the torus . applying the boundary conditions from above in two different orders one obtains @xmath134 hence , consistency of the boundary condition requires @xmath135 the total magnetic flux through the torus @xmath136 is hence quantized in integer units of the elementary magnetic flux quantum @xmath137 .",
    "interestingly , the spectrum of a charged particle in a constant magnetic field is discrete ( but infinitely degenerate ) already in the infinite volume .",
    "as we will see , in the finite periodic volume it has only a finite @xmath138-fold degeneracy determined by the number of flux quanta .",
    "a quantum mechanical charged particle is sensitive to the complex phases defined by the polyakov loops @xmath139 which are measurable in aharonov - bohm - type experiments .",
    "remarkably , the polyakov loops explicitly break the translation invariance of the torus at the quantum level .",
    "this is reminiscent of the quantum mechanical breaking of cp invariance due to the @xmath2-vacuum angle in non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "the complex phases from above are invariant under shifts by integer multiples of @xmath140 in the @xmath16- and @xmath17-directions , respectively .",
    "hence , at the quantum level the continuous translation group of the torus is reduced to a discrete subgroup which plays the role of the accidental symmetry group .    in this paper",
    ", we treat the gauge field as a classical background field , while only the charged particle is treated quantum mechanically .",
    "it is interesting to note that , once the gauge field is also quantized , the transition functions @xmath128 and @xmath129 become fluctuating physical degrees of freedom of the gauge field .",
    "still , as a consequence of @xmath141 and of @xmath142 the transition functions must obey the cocycle consistency condition @xmath143 in this case , the magnetic flux @xmath144 specifies a super - selection sector of the theory .",
    "analogous to the @xmath145 center symmetry of non - abelian @xmath146 gauge theories on a @xmath5-dimensional torus @xcite , abelian gauge theories coupled to charged matter have a global @xmath147 center symmetry .",
    "the self - adjoint extension parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 then turn into conserved quantities ( analogous to bloch momenta ) of the global @xmath148 symmetry on the 2-dimensional torus . in this sense ,",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are analogous to the @xmath2-vacuum angle of non - abelian gauge theories , which also distinguishes different super - selection sectors of the theory .",
    "the @xmath2-vacuum angle is a quantum mechanical source of explicit cp violation . at the classical level , on the other hand",
    ", cp invariance remains intact because @xmath2 does not affect the classical equations of motion .",
    "similarly , for a charged particle on the torus the angles @xmath3 and @xmath4 characterize the explicit breaking of continuous translation invariance down to a discrete subgroup .",
    "just like cp invariance for a non - abelian gauge theory , for a charged particle on the torus the full continuous translation symmetry remains intact at the classical level , because @xmath3 and @xmath4 do not appear in the classical equations of motion .    in this paper",
    ", we treat the charged particle as a test charge which does not surround itself with its own coulomb field .",
    "this would change , once one would derive the charged particle from its own quantum field .",
    "for example , if one considers full - fledged qed , a single electron can not even exist on the torus because the coulomb field that surrounds it is incompatible with periodic boundary conditions . indeed , as a consequence of the gauss law , the total charge on a torus always vanishes .",
    "to cure this problem , one could compensate the charge of the electron by a classical background charge homogeneously spread out over the torus . in our present calculation",
    "this is not necessary , because the charged particle is treated as a test charge without its own surrounding coulomb field .",
    "as we have seen , in order to respect gauge invariance , on the torus the wave function must obey eq.([boundary ] ) , which can be re - expressed as @xmath149 it is interesting to note that a factorization ansatz for the wave function as in eq.([factorization ] ) is inconsistent with the boundary condition .",
    "let us consider the unitary shift operator generating translations by a distance @xmath150 in the @xmath17-direction as well as a @xmath4-dependent phase - shift @xmath151 which acts as @xmath152 obviously , @xmath153 commutes with the hamiltonian because @xmath34 does .",
    "indeed , the shifted wave function does obey the boundary condition eq.([condition ] ) , i.e. @xmath154 which is the case only because @xmath155 furthermore , we also have @xmath156 hence , as we argued before , the translations in the @xmath17-direction are reduced to the discrete group @xmath157 .",
    "in particular , all translations @xmath158 compatible with the boundary conditions can be expressed as the @xmath159-th power of the elementary translation @xmath153 . according to eq.([rp ] ) , @xmath160 , such that @xmath161 similarly , up to gauge transformations the operator @xmath162 generates translations in the @xmath16-direction . since on the torus the runge - lenz vector component @xmath45 , which determines the @xmath17-coordinate of the center of the cyclotron orbit , is defined only modulo @xmath163 , it is indeed natural to consider the translation operator @xmath164 .",
    "in fact , although it formally commutes with the hamiltonian , the operator @xmath45 itself is no longer self - adjoint in the hilbert space of wave functions on the torus . the operator @xmath164 , on the other hand , does act as a unitary operator in the hilbert space .",
    "it is worth noting that , at least in the gauge we have picked , the operator @xmath44 is still self - adjoint .",
    "however , this would not be the case , for example , in the symmetric gauge , and it is hence most natural to work with @xmath164 and @xmath153 instead of @xmath44 and @xmath45 or equivalently @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    the boundary condition of eq.([condition ] ) can now be expressed as @xmath165 as a consequence of the commutation relation @xmath166 = i / e b$ ] , one obtains @xmath167 this implies that @xmath168 i.e. , up to a periodic gauge transformation @xmath169 , @xmath164 translates the wave function by a distance @xmath170 .",
    "remarkably , although at the classical level the torus has two continuous translation symmetries , the corresponding infinitesimal generators @xmath33 and @xmath34 are not self - adjoint in the hilbert space of wave functions on the torus . only the finite translations @xmath164 and @xmath153 are represented by unitary operators , which , however , do not commute with each other .",
    "the two operators @xmath164 and @xmath153 generate a discrete translation group @xmath171 consisting of the elements @xmath172 the group multiplication rule takes the form @xmath173 with all summations being understood modulo @xmath144 .",

    "the inverse of a general group element @xmath177 is given by @xmath178 because @xmath179 it is interesting to consider the conjugacy class of a group element @xmath177 which consists of the elements @xmath180 in particular , as one would expect , the elements @xmath181 are conjugate only to themselves and thus form @xmath144 single - element conjugacy classes .",
    "obviously , multiplication by a phase @xmath182 is just a global gauge transformation and thus leaves the physical state invariant .",
    "hence , the conjugacy classes correspond to gauge equivalence classes .    the elements @xmath183 commute with all other elements and thus form the center @xmath157 of the group @xmath171 .",
    "since the individual elements of the center form separate conjugacy classes , the center is a normal subgroup and can hence be factored out .",
    "the center itself represents global phase transformations of the wave function , and hence factoring it out corresponds to identifying gauge equivalence classes . physically speaking",

    "all we can say ( besides defining the group @xmath171 as done before ) is that it is a particular central extension of @xmath186 by the center subgroup @xmath157 .",
    "let us first discuss the classical problem on the torus . in that case",
    ", the magnetic flux need not be quantized .",
    "also the values of the polyakov loop are not detectable at the classical level because they have no effect on the motion of a test charge , which is entirely determined by the lorentz force .",
    "the classical orbits of a charged particle in a constant magnetic field on the torus still are closed circles . however , as illustrated in figure 1 , the circle may close only after wrapping around the periodic boundary .",
    "since all classical orbits are still closed , one expects that on the torus the accidental symmetry is still present .",
    "it should be pointed out that on the torus the hamiltonian is identically the same as in the infinite volume .",
    "it now just acts on the restricted set of wave functions obeying the boundary condition eq.([condition ] ) . in particular , the finite volume wave functions are appropriate linear combinations of the infinitely many degenerate states of a given landau level . as a result ,",
    "the energy spectrum remains unchanged , but the degeneracy is substantially reduced .",
    "let us use the fact that @xmath153 commutes with the hamiltonian to construct simultaneous eigenstates of both @xmath30 and @xmath153 .",
    "since for states on the torus @xmath187 , the eigenvalues of @xmath153 are given by @xmath188 with @xmath189 , while the eigenvalues of @xmath30 are still given by @xmath190 .",
    "hence , we can construct simultaneous eigenstates @xmath191 such that @xmath192 of eq.([eigenstates ] ) with @xmath193 .",
    "in coordinate representation these states are given by the wave functions @xmath194 as a special case , let us consider the ground state for @xmath195 , which is non - degenerate @xmath196    in this state the probability density , which is illustrated in figure 2 , has its maximum at @xmath197 .",
    "this shows once again that the self - adjoint extension parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 indeed explicitly break translation invariance .    as a consequence of eq.([tcom ] ) one obtains @xmath198 from which we conclude that @xmath199 since @xmath200 = 0 $ ] , the @xmath144 states @xmath191 with @xmath201 thus form an irreducible representation of the magnetic translation group . using @xmath202 as a concrete example , a matrix representation of the two generators of @xmath171 is given by @xmath203    similarly , one can construct simultaneous eigenstates @xmath204 of @xmath30 and @xmath164 @xmath205 of eq.([eigenx ] ) with @xmath206 . in coordinate representation these states",
    "are given by the wave functions @xmath207 it is worth noting that @xmath208 similar to the infinite volume case , it is straightforward to show that the two sets of eigenstates @xmath209 and @xmath210 span the same subspace of the hilbert space .",
    "in particular , for @xmath195 the ground state is non - degenerate and one can show that @xmath211    as we have seen , on the torus continuous translation invariance is explicitly broken down to the discrete magnetic translation group @xmath171 by the self - adjoint extension parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "still , all states ( including the ground state ) remain degenerate .",
    "however , unlike in the infinite volume , the degeneracy is reduced to a finite amount @xmath144 .",
    "only when one varies @xmath3 and @xmath4 one recovers the infinite degeneracy of the infinite system . as in the infinite volume",
    ", one may ask if the degenerate ground state indicates that the discrete magnetic translation group @xmath171 is spontaneously broken . while there are striking similarities with spontaneous symmetry breaking , there are also important differences .",
    "first of all , when a system with a broken symmetry is put in a finite volume , the symmetry is usually restored dynamically .",
    "for example , this is the case for the spontaneously broken @xmath212 chiral symmetry in qcd as well as for the spontaneously broken @xmath213 spin symmetry in antiferromagnets .",
    "an important exception are ferromagnets for which the ground state remains exactly degenerate even in a finite volume .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the magnetization order parameter of a ferromagnet is a conserved quantity , while the staggered magnetization order parameter of an antiferromagnet is not conserved . in this sense",
    ", the charged particle in a magnetic field behaves like a ferromagnet .",
    "the `` order parameter '' that signals the `` spontaneous breakdown '' of translation invariance is the runge - lenz vector @xmath40 pointing to the center of the cyclotron circle , which is indeed a conserved quantity .",
    "it is interesting to construct coherent states @xmath214 for the particle on the torus .",
    "this is achieved by superposition of shifted copies of the coherent state @xmath104 of the system in the infinite volume @xmath215 by construction , this state obeys the boundary condition eq.([conditiont ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath216 is determined from the normalization condition @xmath217 it is easy to see that a finite - volume coherent state remains coherent during the time - evolution .",
    "just as in the infinite volume , @xmath218 , while @xmath121 is time - independent . in the infinite volume",
    "@xmath219 determines the position of the center of the cyclotron circle . on the torus , this center is well - defined only up to shifts by multiples of @xmath220 or @xmath163 .",
    "indeed one finds @xmath221 which shows that ( together with @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) the expectation values @xmath222 and @xmath223 of the infinite volume coherent state determine the position of the center of the cyclotron circle ( the runge - lenz vector ) modulo the periodicity lengths @xmath220 and @xmath163 of the torus .",
    "the prefactors in eq.([expectt ] ) take the form @xmath224 finally , let us consider the coherent states with @xmath117 but arbitrary @xmath121 .",
    "just as in the infinite volume , these states are ground states with minimal energy @xmath119 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath195 ( i.e.  when there is no degeneracy ) one can show that @xmath225 ( provided that the arbitrary complex phase of @xmath226 is chosen appropriately ) .",
    "we have re - investigated an old and rather well - studied problem in quantum mechanics  a charged particle in a constant magnetic field  from an unconventional accidental symmetry perspective .",
    "the fact that all classical cyclotron orbits are closed circles identifies the center of the circle as a conserved quantity analogous to the runge - lenz vector of the kepler problem . remarkably , ( up to gauge transformations ) the corresponding `` accidental '' symmetry is just translation invariance . in particular , the coordinates @xmath227 of the center of the cyclotron circle simultaneously generate infinitesimal translations @xmath228 and @xmath33 ( up to gauge transformations ) in the @xmath17- and @xmath16-directions , respectively . as is well - known , in a constant magnetic field translations in the @xmath16- and @xmath17-directions do not commute , i.e.  @xmath229 = i e b$ ] , and thus the two coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the center of the cyclotron circle are also not simultaneously measurable at the quantum level .",
    "in contrast , the radius of the cyclotron circle has a sharp value in an energy eigenstate .",
    "the accidental symmetry leads to the infinite degeneracy of the landau levels .    in order to further investigate the nature of the accidental symmetry ,",
    "we have put the system in a finite rectangular periodic volume .",
    "obviously , this breaks rotation invariance , but leaves translation invariance ( and thus the accidental symmetry ) intact  at least at the classical level .",
    "interestingly , at the quantum level continuous translation invariance is explicitly broken down to a discrete magnetic translation group , due to the existence of two angles @xmath3 and @xmath4 which parametrize a family of self - adjoint extensions of the hamiltonian on the torus . in a field theoretical context , in which the gauge field is dynamical ( and not just treated as a classical background field ) , the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 characterize super - selection sectors . in this sense , they are analogous to the vacuum angle @xmath2 of non - abelian gauge theories . just as the @xmath2-vacuum angle explicitly breaks cp invariance at the quantum level but is classically invisible , the angles @xmath3 and @xmath4 lead to a quantum mechanical explicit breaking of continuous translation invariance down to the discrete magnetic translation group .",
    "the magnetic translation group @xmath171 itself , which plays the role of the accidental symmetry in the periodic volume , is a particular central extension of @xmath230 by the center subgroup @xmath157 , where @xmath144 is the number of magnetic flux quanta trapped in the torus .",
    "we find it remarkable that the simple fact that all classical cyclotron orbits are closed circles has such intricate effects at the quantum level .",
    "we have also discussed the relation of ground state degeneracy with the possible spontaneous breakdown of translation invariance . indeed the runge - lenz vector ( which points to the center of the cyclotron orbit ) acts as a corresponding `` order parameter '' . just like the magnetization in a ferromagnet ( but unlike the staggered magnetization in an antiferromagnet ) , the runge - lenz vector is a conserved quantity .",
    "consequently , the ground state remains degenerate even in a finite volume .",
    "furthermore , just as the three components of the magnetization vector do not commute with each other , the two components of the runge - lenz vector are also not simultaneously measurable .",
    "still , unlike a ferromagnet , a single charged particle in a magnetic field has just a finite number of degrees of freedom and can thus not display all features usually associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "in particular , in the system discussed in this paper there is no room for massless goldstone excitations .",
    "while many aspects of the landau level problem are well - known , we hope that we have painted a picture of cyclotron motion that reveals new aspects of this fascinating system , which behaves in a unique and sometimes counter - intuitive manner .",
    "we like to thank nathan habegger for an illuminating discussion about the theory of discrete groups . this work is supported in parts by the schweizerischer nationalfonds ."
