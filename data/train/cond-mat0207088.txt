    "statistical deposition models have attracted much attention in the last years because they may describe real systems features by representing the basic growth mechanisms as simple stochastic processes , thus neglecting the details of the microscopic interactions  @xcite .",
    "some examples are the family model  @xcite , the restricted solid - on - solid ( @xmath4 ) model of kim and kosterlitz  @xcite and the ballistic deposition ( @xmath9 ) model  @xcite .",
    "the former one is representative of the edwards - wilkinson ( @xmath10 ) universality class  @xcite of linear growth , while the other ones are representative of the kardar - parisi - zhang ( @xmath11 ) class  @xcite of non - linear growth .",
    "more complex models involve the competition among deposition , diffusion and aggregation  @xcite and may represent quantitatively real systems features .",
    "often one is interested in surface properties , then the main quantity to be measured is the interface width of the deposit . if deposition occurs in a @xmath12-dimensional substrate of length @xmath13 , then the interface width at time @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 } ^{1/2 } } \\right > }   \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] or as @xmath16 } ^{1/2 } .",

    "the interface width increases as @xmath22 while at long times finite - size effects lead to its saturation at @xmath23 relations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are included in the dynamic scaling relation proposed by family and vicsek  @xcite , @xmath24 in which @xmath25 is a scaling function and the dynamical exponent @xmath2 is given by @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , the argument of the scaling function is a ratio of the deposition time and the crossover ( or saturation ) time @xmath27 .",

    "the calculation of @xmath28 requires the identification of the steady - state regime , in which @xmath20 saturates . eventually , the extrapolation of effective exponents is essential , such as in the @xmath9 model  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath29 depends on the definition of the growth regime , which must be a region of high linear correlation in a @xmath30 plot .",
    "finding such region may be very difficult for @xmath31 due to small lattice lengths  @xcite .",
    "the usual methods to estimate exponent @xmath2 are based on data collapse of the scaled quantities appearing in eq .",
    "( 5 ) or on the scaling of the structure factor @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the fourier transformation of the surface height @xmath34 )  @xcite . in a recent work ,",
    "kim et al presented a method to estimate @xmath2 from the exponential decay of a relaxation function , starting the growth process from a sinusoidal surface  @xcite . in @xmath35",
    ", they obtained estimates for the family , the @xmath4 and the krug models which were consistent with the expected universality classes  @xcite .",
    "however , for the most common problem of deposition in a flat surface , a precise definition of the crossover time @xmath0 and a method to estimate @xmath2 accurately are still lacking .",
    "it is also important to recall that there are controversies on the universality classes of various statistical growth models even in @xmath35  @xcite . at this point ,",
    "the development of reliable techniques to estimate critical exponents is also helpful .",
    "the aim of this work is to analyze the convergence of the scaling function in eq .",

    "we will show that the typical decay of @xmath20 to its saturation value is exponential , which uniquely defines the crossover or saturation time @xmath0 .",

    "iv we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "first we recall the definition of the models studied here .    in the family model  @xcite , a column of the deposit is randomly chosen and the incident particle searches for the smallest height in its neighborhood . if no neighboring column has a smaller height than the column of incidence , the particle sticks at the top of this one .",
    "otherwise , it sticks at the top of the column with the smallest height among the neighbors .",
    "if two or more neighbors have the same minimum height , the sticking position is randomly chosen among them .    in the @xmath4 model",
    "@xcite , the incident particle may stick at the top of the column of incidence if the differences of heights of all pairs of neighboring columns do not exceed @xmath40 .",
    "otherwise , the aggregation attempt is rejected .    in @xmath9 ,",
    "the incident particle follows a straight trajectory perpendicular to the surface and sticks upon first contact with a nearest neighbor occupied site .",
    "it leads to the formation of a porous deposit , contrary to the previous solid - on - solid models .    in all models",
    ", a time unit corresponds to the deposition of @xmath13 particles .",
    "we simulated them in one - dimensional substrates with lengths @xmath41 , with integer @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "for each @xmath13 , typically @xmath44 different deposits were generated , and very long steady - state regions were observed .    in order to obtain reliable estimates of @xmath37 , we computed it over different time ranges to ensure that it was fluctuating around an average value , and not increasing systematically in time ( the latter possibility would suggest that the steady - state region was not attained yet ) .",
    "@xmath37 was obtained with accuracy smaller than @xmath45 in all cases , which enables the calculation of the deviation from @xmath37 , @xmath46 also with good accuracy .    in fig .",
    "1a we show @xmath47 for the family model in @xmath48 , and in fig .",
    "1b we show @xmath47 for the @xmath4 and @xmath9 models , also in @xmath48 . in figs .",
    "2a and 2b we show @xmath49 in the same systems .",
    "it clearly shows an exponential decay of @xmath20 and @xmath21 to @xmath37 and @xmath50 , in the form @xmath51 with constants @xmath52 and @xmath0 .",
    "the estimates of relaxation times shown in figs . 1 and 2 were obtained from fits of the data in regions of high linear correlation . for the other lengths @xmath13 ,",
    "similar linear behaviors in @xmath47 plots were obtained .",
    "the calculation of @xmath0 from those plots has some disadvantages .",

    "both sets of data strongly suggest an asymptotic exponent @xmath8 , which agrees with simulations of marinari et al  @xcite , who obtained @xmath82 .",
    "however , it disagrees with the proposal of @xmath83 based on an operator product expansion  @xcite , which suggests further investigations on these lines .    for the family model , it is expected the dynamic scaling relation  @xcite @xmath84 } \\label{eq:14}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is a scaling function and @xmath52 is constant . as @xmath85 , it is expected that @xmath86 , with constant @xmath55 . the characteristic time @xmath1 defined from eq .",

    "then , in order to define a characteristic time @xmath87 which is proportional to @xmath0 in this system , we consider @xmath88 with constant @xmath89",

    ", @xmath5 converges to @xmath6 as @xmath72 , in agreement with the @xmath10 theory .",
    "our result is significantly better than the value @xmath91 , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite using data collapse methods , which again proves the reliability of our method .",
    "we proposed and tested methods to estimate crossover times of interface width scaling and the dynamic exponent @xmath2 .",

    "the reliability of the method was proved by testing it with the family , the @xmath4 and @xmath9 models in @xmath92 dimensions , in which dynamic exponents of the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 theory were obtained . the family and the @xmath4 models in @xmath36 were also considered . for the @xmath4 model , the exponential decay of @xmath20",

    "the relevance of our methods to estimate dynamical exponents is also proved by comparisons with previous results for related systems .",
    "for instance , using data collapse of relaxation functions and the expected scaling of @xmath20 at @xmath93 , @xmath94 was obtained for eden clusters  @xcite and @xmath95 for the single - step model  @xcite in @xmath35 .",
    "both systems are in the @xmath11 class ( exact @xmath96 ) .",
    "these difficulties were pointed out in the paper of kim et al  @xcite , who proposed a method to measure @xmath2 from the scaling of a relaxation function and an initial sinusoidal surface . although the efficiency of their method was clearly stated , working with a flat surface is the most usual initial situation in theoretical works and is more suitable for real applications . moreover , with our method , one is able to calculate three exponents , @xmath28 , @xmath2 and @xmath29 , using the same set of data .",
    "the relevance of each one to determine the universality class of a particular model may depend on several factors , such as the strength of finite - size corrections .",
