    "downes ( @xcite ) , almost 30 years ago , proposed that the radio source ctb  80 ( g69.0 + 2.7 ) was a supernova remnant .",
    "however , confirmation came only in 1974 when observations of total , and polarized intensity of a number of radio sources were performed by velusamy and kundu ( @xcite ) .",
    "the non - thermal emission , and the strong polarization of the source thus offered further support to the initial claim , and established the source s peculiar radio morphology .",
    "the radio images show the presence of a ( @xmath3 1 ) compact central source ( spectral index @xmath3 0.0 for s@xmath6 @xmath7 ) , a plateau to the east of the compact core extending for @xmath3 10@xmath4 6  ( spectral index @xmath3 0.3 ) and three large scale structures extending , roughly , to the north , to the east and to the south  west ( spectral index @xmath3 0.8 , angerhofer  @xcite , strom and stappers @xcite ) .",
    "the source , depending upon the frequency of observation , displays a different morphology while the polarization is quite strong over a large part of the radio emission .",
    "radio observations in 1984 and 1985 led strom ( @xcite ) to propose that the radio properties of the central compact core indicated the presence of a central neutron star .",
    "interest in this source intensified following the discovery of a 39.5 ms ( @xmath8 yr old ) radio pulsar at the center of the radio compact core ( clifton  @xcite ) .",
    "shortly after the pulsar discovery , fesen  ( @xcite ) reported the detection of a shell of infrared emission correlated with the radio lobes of .",
    "the iras shell centered @xmath9 east of the pulsar , and characterized by a diameter of @xmath3 1 , is open in the south  west and has a higher surface brightness in the 60 @xmath10 m wavelength regime than in the 100 @xmath10 m regime .",
    "these properties led the authors to suggest that the presumably fast moving pulsar caught up the decelerating supernova shell and , through the pressure of its relativistic wind has broken off the southwestern portion of the hi shell deforming the magnetic field structure , and producing the peculiar south  west protrusion in the radio emission . this suggestion is further supported by the detection of an expanding hi shell by koo  ( @xcite ) . the hi shell is clumpy ( koo  @xcite ) , its south  west part is also open and is very well correlated with the infrared shell .",
    "the distance to  is approximately 2 kpc , although distances in the range of 1.5  2.5 kpc can not be excluded ( koo  @xcite , strom & stappers @xcite ) .",
    "major characteristics of the remnant in x - ray wavelengths are the low count rate , and its small spatial extent ( wang and seward @xcite , safi ",
    "harb  @xcite ) .",
    "the rosat data show that the soft x - ray flux is confined to the area around the pulsar ( @xmath3 11  @xmath4 5 ) while the medium and hard x - ray flux show extended emission east , south  east of the pulsar .",
    "the spectrum indicates an average photon power - law index of @xmath3 1.8 .",
    "the column density was not well determined due to the low x - ray counting statistics and was found to lie in the range of 10@xmath11 ",
    "10@xmath12 @xmath13 ( safi  harb  @xcite ) .",
    "the authors also studied the temporal behavior of the central source and concluded that the pulsed fraction has a significant dependence on the energy .",
    "several optical observations have been performed , though the majority of them have focused on the area in the immediate neighbourhood of the pulsar ( e.g. blair  @xcite , whitehead  @xcite , and hester and kulkarni @xcite ) .",
    "wide field red plates taken by van den bergh ( @xcite ) in  and   showed faint , patchy nebulosity .",
    "blair  ( @xcite ) performed interference filter observations in  of two 30@xmath4 30  areas located south  west and north  east of the pulsar .",
    "the area around the pulsar was also observed in  but no emission was detected apart from the nebulosity surrounding the pulsar .",
    "spectra taken at two restricted areas in the south  west and the north  east indicate moderate absorption and shock heating .    in this work we present the first comprehensive ccd imaging in , ,  and , of the area around , covering a wide field of @xmath3 2  @xmath4 2 , at a resolution of 4   5 .",
    "these new optical images reveal a rich network of filamentary and diffuse structures allowing for a better comparison with existing radio , infrared , and x - ray data .",
    "information about the observations and the data reduction is given in sect .",
    "2 , while in sect .",
    "3 we describe the observed morphology in the various filters . finally , in sect .",
    "4 we discuss the physical properties of the remnant , its positional relation , and interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the optical images of  were obtained with the 0.3 m telescope at skinakas observatory . the remnant was observed in july 9 , july 10 , and october 13 , 1999 .",
    "two different ccd s were used during these observations .",
    "the first , was a 1024 @xmath4 1024 thomson ccd which resulted in a 69  @xmath4 69  field of view and an image scale of 412 per pixel .",
    "the second was a 1024 @xmath4 1024 site ccd which had a larger pixel size resulting in a 89  @xmath4 89  field of view and an image scale of 521 per pixel .",
    "our aim was to cover the whole field defined by the faintest radio contours at 1410 mhz ( mantovani @xcite ) . given the large extent of the remnant , we performed several pointings in order to have the best possible coverage of the field . at each pointing the relevant field",
    "was observed for 1800 s at two different instances , i.e. the total exposure time is 3600 s. consequently , overlapping areas have an effective exposure time of 7200 s. every field was projected to a common origin before any image combination .",
    "the astrometric solutions were calculated with the aid of the hubble space telescope guide star catalogue .",
    "the characteristics of the interference filters used during the observations are listed in table  [ filters ] .",
    "all coordinates in this work refer to epoch 2000 .",
    "standard iraf and midas routines were used for the reduction of the data .",
    "individual frames were bias subtracted and flat - field corrected using well exposed twilight flat - fields .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard stars hr7596 , hr7950 , hr8634 , and hr718 were used for flux calibration .",
    "the field in the area of  contains both filamentary and diffuse structures .",
    "the nebulosity around the pulsar at  @xmath14 1953   and  @xmath14 3253  is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as a slightly extended `` star - like '' object situated in a 10  @xmath4 10  patch of diffuse  emission . north of psr 1951 + 32 ,",
    "several small scale structures are detected in the  image ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "they are nicely correlated with the north radio ridge ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) as well as with the north part of the i(60 @xmath10m)/ i(100 @xmath10 m ) map of fesen ( @xcite , hereafter fss ) while their relation to the  emission (  /  @xmath3 1.0 ) further suggests that we observe shocked material associated with the remnant . to the west of the pulsar and towards the south , we find the known network of filaments ( position i in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , see also fig .",
    "1a of blair  @xcite ) . in this area ,",
    "diffuse emission is seen to the west of the bright filament at  @xmath14 1951  and  @xmath14 3232(position ii ) , lying just outside the faintest radio contours at 1410 mhz ( mantovani  @xcite ) .",
    "the typical surface brightness fluxes measured in the  and  images lie in the range of 3040 @xmath4  and 512 @xmath4 , respectively . south of the radio contours and at positions iii and iv two patches of emission",
    "are detected running along the west  east direction at  @xmath14 3210 .",
    "faint emission , at the same declination , appears to fill the gap between these two locations and might indicate their physical relation . the optical radiation at location iv displays filamentary structures of projected widths @xmath3 10  to 30 .",
    "the structure seems to curve towards the north , north  east .",
    "the overall appearance of these structures in the  image is less filamentary .",
    "the bright diffuse emission to the south  east of position iv occupies an area of @xmath3 30  @xmath4 18  and its relation to is not certain .",
    "a search in the simbad database around  @xmath14 1955  and  @xmath14 3205  did not reveal any previously known extended object , although diffuse emission is seen in the poss plates .",
    "north of this extended structure , we come across two elongated structures at positions v and vi ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ,  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the first one is oriented in the se to nw direction and is characterized by a length of @xmath3 20  and typical thickness of @xmath3 30  while the second is oriented along the sw to ne direction and extends for @xmath3 33 .",
    "the thickness of this structure is @xmath3 1  and its position coincides with the outer south part of the i(60 @xmath10m)/ i(100 @xmath10 m ) map of fss .",
    "the positions of these locations ( v and vi ) completely overlap the radio contours ( eastern ridge ) at 1410 mhz ( mantovani  @xcite ) . at the ne boundary of the radio contours the known lynd s bright nebula 156 ( lynds @xcite )",
    "is found , which is quite bright in both the  and filters .",
    "part of lbn 158 is seen to the west of lbn 156 at the west edge of our field .",
    "interestingly , at the north end of lbn 156 we see two thin arcs convex to the west extending further to the north for @xmath3 38(location vii ) .",
    "these two arcs have a projected thickness of @xmath3 30and cross each other at  @xmath14 195630  and  @xmath14 3350 , while the crossing area is rather extended ( 10  @xmath4 4 ) .",
    "the arcs are also seen in the  image but are less prominent .",
    "the morphology of the area around  in  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) is quite different from that seen in the  and  images .",
    "the field is relatively clean of diffuse , patchy emission while a few filamentary structures are seen .",
    "the first filament is detected sw of the pulsar and has a length of @xmath3 3and a projected thickness of @xmath3 25 .",
    "it is located at position i where the corresponding  flux is lower by a factor of @xmath3 2 than the flux of the neighbouring filaments .",
    "blair  ( @xcite ) did not detect any  emission in their `` sw '' spectrum since it was taken @xmath3 11  away .",
    "another  filament which has an  and  counterpart is located at  @xmath14 195030  and  @xmath14 3234(our position ii , position `` ssw '' of blair  @xcite ) . around",
    "@xmath14 1950  and  @xmath14 3215  we find a filament which is @xmath3 12  long and @xmath3 40  wide ( position iia in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "a noteworthy feature of this filament is its location along the outer radio contours , in the south , at 1410 mhz ( mantovani  @xcite ) .",
    "emission from the low ionization lines of ,  and   ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ,  [ fig2 ] ,  [ fig5 ] ) is only partially correlated with this  emission . to the south of position iv a @xmath3 17  long  filamentary structure",
    "is detected which has no obvious  counterpart .",
    "its thickness ranges from @xmath3 30   60 .",
    "this structure is @xmath3 14  away to the south of the outer 1410 mhz radio contours .",
    "a peculiar  structure , which has a shape similar to the number `` 9 '' , is found around  @xmath14 1953  and  @xmath14 3230just inside the outer radio contour at 1410 mhz . finally , the last  features present in the field are the arcs to the north of lbn 156 ( position vii ) .",
    "however , only one of the arcs is seen for @xmath3 38  while the second one is seen for @xmath3 10 .",
    "the morphology of the field in  ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) is generally similar to that seen in  and  but still , important diferences do exist .",
    "some of the filaments seen in , sw of the pulsar ( position i ) , have a counterpart in  while others do not .",
    "furthermore , in the position of an filament , in the same area , we see in the  image localized emission areas scattered along the general direction of the  filament .",
    "it is interesting to note that the filament seen in  in the south of position i is better defined than in .",
    "additionally , we observe that the long  filament ( south of position iv ) is seen as a series of localized emission `` hills '' in .",
    "the `` valleys '' ( gaps ) between the bright `` hills '' have typical lengths of the order of 0.2  0.4 pc .",
    "also , while we detect  emission at position iv there is practically no emission in .",
    "the extended diffuse structure in the south is also visible in   while to its north , we observe less structured emission which is partially correlated with the  emission ( positions v and vi ) . finally , the bright nebula lbn 156 and the two arcs in the very north of our field are present and well correlated with the  and  line emission .",
    "deep exposures have been obtained from the area east of the two arcs and the results will be presented elsewhere ( mavromatakis  @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting aspect concerning almost all of our line images is that the filaments in the west and the sw seem to define rather well the two sides of a triangle much like the shape of any closed , outer contour at 1410 mhz ( mantovani  @xcite ) .",
    "we have analyzed public asca data of  in order to have an accurate determination of the column density which would allow us to obtain estimates of the color excess , e(@xmath15 ) and the average ism density .",
    "an estimate of the color excess is desirable since current measurements refer to the pulsar neighbourhood ( e.g. hester and kulkarni @xcite ) while away from the pulsar the measurements are less certain ( blair  @xcite ) .",
    "determination of the hydrogen column density will provide us with an order of magnitude estimate of the ism density around  which can be compared with our estimates of the preshock cloud densities .",
    "the source was observed in june 17 , 1993 ( sequence i d 50037010 ) by the gis and sis detectors onboard the asca satellite . applying the strict selection criteria to the original data resulted in 25 ks and 19 ks exposure time for the gis and sis detectors , respectively .",
    "the hardness ratios between the 0.8 - 2.0 kev , 2.0 - 6.0 kev and the 6.0 - 12.0 kev bands did not reveal any statistically significant spectral variations .",
    "consequently , all photons within a 8  radius from the center of the gis intensity distribution were accumulated to create a source spectrum , while from the sis data all photons within a rectangular area of @xmath3 4  @xmath4 4  were accumulated .",
    "an important point to be mentioned concerns the background subtraction .",
    "the available blank  sky background spectra are obtained from observations towards high galactic latitudes . however ,  is only @xmath3 3  away from the galactic plane where a different spectral behavior of the sky background is expected .",
    "we have extracted a few observations from the asca database which were performed in the direction of .",
    "the analysis showed that a thermal ( t @xmath3 0.59 kev ) and a non  thermal component ( @xmath16 1.2 ) could fit the source free spectra close to the galactic plane .",
    "subsequently , these components were included in the fits of the snr spectra by keeping the temperature and power  law index fixed at the forementioned values .",
    "we find that a simple power - model attenuated by the intervening column density provides a sufficient description of the data .",
    "the photon power ",
    "law index is 1.95@xmath17 and the column density is 2.9@xmath18 @xmath4 10@xmath11 @xmath13 .",
    "the quoted errors refer to the 90% probability level for two parameters of interest ( @xmath19 @xmath20 4.61 ) . in the case where we do not include the galactic plane background component",
    ", we find a photon power ",
    "law index of 1.88@xmath21 and a column density of 2.6@xmath22 @xmath4 10@xmath11 @xmath13 .",
    "the two methods provide results that agree within the statistical errors due to the low counting statistics of .",
    "nevertheless , the contribution of the galactic plane background should always be taken into account when analyzing source spectra near the galactic plane .",
    "we note here that our results are in good agreement with the results reported by safi ",
    "harb  ( @xcite ) , however , the allowed range of the parameters is much narrower now .",
    "current measurements of the color excess suggest values in the range of @xmath3 0.7  1 ( e.g. blair  @xcite , @xcite ) . assuming the relation n@xmath23 = @xmath24 @xmath4 e(b - v ) @xmath13 mag@xmath1 ( ryter   @xcite ) , and the best determined n@xmath23 from the asca data , we derive a color excess of 0.38 @xmath25 0.10 mag .",
    "clearly , the relation used is a statistical relation and deviations of 3  4@xmath26 could be justified . however , if the observed difference is true , then the x - ray measured color excess of @xmath3 0.4 will represent the amount of pure interstellar extinction .",
    "the additional 0.3  0.4 mags of extinction would be due to local extinction around the core area . in any case , applying the interstellar reddening curve of whitford ( @xcite ) as presented by kaler ( @xcite ) , an interstellar extinction c of 0.57 ( @xmath25 0.15 ) is obtained .",
    "finally , the average ism density towards  is @xmath3 0.5 , assuming a distance of 2 kpc ( koo  @xcite , strom and stappers @xcite ) .",
    "fss reported the detection of an infrared emitting shell in the area of .",
    "the shell posseses an angular diameter of @xmath3 1 , is characterized by strong 60 @xmath10 m emission relative to the 100 @xmath10 m emission and is correlated with the radio emission .",
    "hi observations by koo  ( @xcite ) revealed the presence of a clumpy shell , open in the south ",
    "west , expanding at @xmath3 70 km s@xmath1 .",
    "they also estimated a density of the hi medium of 1.7 @xmath27 .",
    "subsequent vla hi observations by koo  ( @xcite ) showed that the clumpy nature of the hi shell is caused by dense , fast moving hi clumps .",
    "these clumps preexisted the supernova explosion and were accelerated by the blast wave .",
    "the two shells ( infrared and hi ) are very well correlated suggesting their association with , while the smaller extent of the hi shell is probably due to the difficulty in distinguishing emission of the low radial velocity portion of the hi shell from galactic background emission ( koo  @xcite ) .",
    "the optical emission detected north , north  east of the pulsar position is rather well correlated with the iras ratio map of i(60 @xmath10m)/i(100 @xmath10 m ) of fss as well as with the hi shell of koo  (    @xcite ) .",
    "the optical emission in this area lies inside the outer infrared ( dashed ) contour and outside the hi ( dash  dotted ) contour in fig .",
    "the solid contour corresponds to radio continuum emission at 49 cm ( strom & stappers @xcite ) while the three short lines in the south , south  west indicate the positions of the prominent  filaments . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] there is also a good degree of correlation between hi , infrared and optical emission in the south , south  east ( positions v and vi ) .",
    "the degree of correlation between the optical and infrared data increases when we consider the individual iras maps of e.g. the 60 @xmath10 m emission .",
    "optical forbidden line emission at positions iv and v seem to be related to the 60 @xmath10 m emission . based on this positional correspondence between the optical , hi and infrared emission , and the estimated flux ratio of [ sii]/  @xmath3 0.7  1.0 ( extinction of @xmath3 0.6 asssumed ) at these areas ,",
    "it is proposed that the observed optical emission is indeed associated with .",
    "the filamentary and diffuse structures in locations iii , iv , v , and vi along with lbn 156 may be viewed as forming part of an , almost continuous , shell structure .",
    "this adds further support to fss s previous suggestion that lbn 156 is also associated with .",
    "the calibrated flux images at positions i and ii ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) do not provide any strong evidence for incomplete recombination zones .",
    "the estimated values of  / are found in the range of 1  3 while a value of @xmath3 7 ( the minimum extinction of 0.6 was assumed ) is obtained at position iia ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "raymond  ( @xcite ) report a maximum ratio of 6 for complete shock structures and shock velocities between 80 and 140 km s@xmath1 .",
    "since we are dealing most likely with complete shocks , the results of cox and raymond ( @xcite ) and raymond  ( @xcite ) can be used to infer some basic shock properties .",
    "the presence of faint  emission ( @xmath3 6 @xmath4 ) together with the high values of the [ oii]/[oiii ] ratio ( @xmath28 38 , extinction of @xmath30.6 asssumed ) suggest shock velocities between 85 and 120 km s@xmath1 , and most probably towards the high end of this range .",
    "since the column density of a fully developed flow , roughly , scales as 10@xmath29 u@xmath30 @xmath13 ( raymond  @xcite ) , where u@xmath31 denotes the shock velocity in units of 100 km s@xmath1 , we can set upper limits to the preshock cloud density .",
    "the column density is @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 where l is the projected thickness of a filament and @xmath35 the preshock cloud density",
    ". a typical thickness of a filament at positions i and ii is 9 @xmath4 10@xmath36 cm for a distance of 2 kpc ( koo  @xcite , strom and stappers @xcite ) , thus we obtain @xmath35 @xmath37 3.6 @xmath4 u@xmath30 . for shock velocities in the range of 85 and 120",
    "km s@xmath1 , we get @xmath35 @xmath37 2.6  and 5.2 , respectively .    in neighbouring locations around positions i and ii possible",
    "emission is below our detection limit while  emission is detected well above the sky background .",
    "since these two lines originate from the same element , it is rather likely that the shock velocity is less than 100 km s@xmath1 . in this case , the upper limit to the preshock cloud density becomes 3.6 . a possible explanation for the lower",
    "shock velocities could involve higher cloud densities by factors of 1.5  2.0 than the cloud densities where both  and  are detected .",
    "a different situation seems to hold for the  filament at position iia .",
    "it is partially correlated with  emission while the degree of correlation is even smaller when the  and  images are examined .",
    "these morphological differences suggest the presence of inhomogeneities in the preshock medium .",
    "the low ionization lines are produced in areas of lower temperatures while the  line emerges from higher temperature regions .",
    "the less hot areas are found at larger distances behind the shock front and consequently , at higher column densities .",
    "inhomogeneities in the preshock clouds would mainly affect regions of higher column densities .",
    "at the same time , preshock cloud density variations would also affect the recombination zone through their effect on the cooling and recombination time scales ( see hester @xcite for more details ) .      in the south and close to position",
    "iv , a long  filament is detected .",
    "typical surface brightness values are of the order of 12 @xmath4 .",
    "the same spatial location in the  image looks completely different where small size patches ( @xmath3 50  @xmath4 30 ) of emitting material are seen , instead of a well defined filament . according to cox and raymond ( @xcite ) shock velocities greater than 100 km",
    "s@xmath1 would be required to give rise to the observed  and  fluxes .",
    "inhomogeneities and preshock density variations are probably the cause of the observed differences in morphology .",
    "the ccd images suggest angular length scales of @xmath3 25  of these irregularities .",
    "an important issue related to the presence of this filament is whether or not it is associated with .",
    "even though , a negative correlation can not be formally excluded , a positive correlation may be more favorable given the shape , the spatial location and emission characteristics of this  filament .",
    "in addition , we note that this filament is located along the outer boundary of a region of relatively strong 60 @xmath10 m emission seen in the iras maps ( wheelock  @xcite ) . a positive indentification",
    "would imply a larger extent than currently assumed and , consequently , a larger shock radius .",
    "new , more sensitive radio observations at 1410 mhz would help to clarify this issue .",
    "the east , south  east area of  shows mainly diffuse optical radiation , eventhough a few filamentary structures are present .",
    "these are characterized by lengths of @xmath3 60  ",
    "110  and projected widths of @xmath3 20 .",
    "assuming complete shock structures , shock velocities less than 100 km s@xmath1 and a distance of 2 kpc ( koo  @xcite , strom and stappers @xcite ) , we find that the preshock cloud densities n@xmath38 should satisfy n@xmath38 @xmath37 5 @xmath27 .",
    "such shock velocities may be expected , according to the calculations of cox and raymond ( @xcite ) , since associated [ oiii ] emission is not detected , while in one location (  = 195535  and  = 323303 ) [ oii ] is also detected well above the sky background .",
    "harb  ( @xcite ) analyzed rosat pspc and hri data taken from the field of .",
    "the pspc data show the presence of four extended irregular structures in the south  east apart from the emission observed around the pulsar .",
    "the whole enhancement is described as the cone  like feature by safi ",
    "harb  @xcite ) and includes an elongated structure along the outer boundary of the pspc in the south  east .",
    "the cone  like feature overlaps the optical emission at positions v and vi and the elongated structure partially overlaps the bright diffuse emission south of position iv .",
    "given the strong sulfur line emission observed from this bright diffuse structure , it would be interesting to see if future radio observations would detect a thermal or non  thermal spectrum .",
    "however , at the moment , no firm conclusions can be drawn about the correlation between the optical and x - ray data .      though shell - like structures have been seen in hi ,",
    "the infrared , and now in the optical ,  is no common shell snr .",
    "there is substantial and multifaceted evidence that psr 1951 + 32 has strongly interacted with and altered the remnant as is evident from its unusual radio appearance .",
    "it is necessary to proceed with care in attempting to reconstruct its evolution . as noted earlier ( sect .",
    "4.2 ) the optical observations appear to support the suggestion of fss and koo ( @xcite ) for a breakout of the sn shell south west of the pulsar , presumably through the action of a strong particle and electromagnetic wind , which has deformed the shell s magnetic field , and has given rise to the south western radio emission ridge .",
    "the radio images at 1410 mhz and 1720 mhz show that faint emission extends for more than 15 in the north  south and west  east directions .",
    "the optical data span in declination from 322 to 335 , while the span in right ascension is somewhat smaller .",
    "the new optical emission features detected in the south , south  east ( positions iv , v and vi ) seem to define an extended emission arc of large curvature , while the optical features detected in the north delinetate an emission arc of smaller curvature .",
    "this apparent discrepancy could be reconciled if we adopt the evolutionary scenario of  proposed by koo  ( @xcite ) . according to this scenario , soon after the supernova explosion ( @xmath3 2000 yr ) the blast wave broke out into a cavity in the south ",
    "east , while in the north , north  west the shock front propagated into a denser but clumpy interstellar medium .",
    "the pulsar was born with a westward velocity , and caught up the slower expanding shell after @xmath3 10@xmath39 yr .",
    "consequently , the optical structures at positions iii , iv and vi may roughly define the south , south  east boundaries of a cavity seen in the hi data , while the structure at position v may be projected into the cavity area , or else be related to the cavity s foreground edge .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then the optical data suggest that the cavity must extend from declination @xmath14 3310  to @xmath14 3210 .",
    "the correlation between the enhanced iras emission along the east cavity wall , and the optical radiation may suggest that the shock front encountered a dense medium .",
    "note here that diffuse x  ray emission is mainly detected in this area ( safi  harb  @xcite ) which may tie with the presence of the hi cavity permeated by hot , low density gas ( koo  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the secondary shock driven into these dense clouds allowed the production of , , and  radiation but its velocity was not high enough to allow for the production of  radiation , i.e. the shock velocity is probably less than @xmath3 70   ( cox & raymond @xcite , hartigan  @xcite ) .",
    "however ,  filamentary emission ( positions i , ii , iia , and iii ) is clearly detected in the south , south - west ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "consequently , shock velocities greater than @xmath3 80  are expected in these locations according to the calculations of cox & raymond ( @xcite ) .",
    "these areas are found to the south of the dense hi cloud detected by koo  ( @xcite ) where the iras and hi emission is weak ( fss , koo  @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of shock heated filaments at positions i and ii suggests that the injection of pulsar  generated relativistic particles ( fss ) has a strong impact on the `` break - out '' portion of the remnant s south western segment which may have been compressed westward , possibly against preexisting `` clouds '' .",
    "the rich network of filaments seen in the low ionization lines and the spatially limited but filamentary  emission ( positions i and ii ) on the leading edge of the south  west radio ridge indicate different shock velocities as well as inhomegenities in the interstellar medium ( see also koo  @xcite ) .",
    "summarizing we can propose the following .",
    "the optically emitting gas detected in the north in the  filter delineates a circular structure which is very well correlated with the radio , infrared and hi radiation .",
    "the north part of the emission corresponds to the undisturbed part of the shock while in the south  east the accelerated shock front has reached the oposite walls of the hi cavity .",
    "the shock velocity into the cavity walls was sufficiently low not to allow for the production of  emission while faster shocks have propagated towards the south , south  west .",
    "the pulsar relativistic wind interacts with the preexisting clouds giving rise to a complex network of filaments along the south ",
    "west radio ridge .",
    "a @xmath3 2@xmath42  area around the pulsar psr 1951@xmath032 was observed in , ,  and .",
    "the low ionization line images of  and  show significant emission not detected before at locations in the south and south  east .",
    "the  image shows also emission north of the pulsar , clearly , tracing the infrared shell and the north radio ridge .",
    "the morphology of the  and  images is similar .",
    "the  image appears rather faint in relation to the images in the lower ionization lines , probably reflecting the remnant s advanced age and low expansion velocity .",
    "the differences between the oxygen line images and the morphologies seen in the lower ionization images suggest the existence of density variations and inhomogenities in the preshock interstellar medium .",
    "rough upper limits to the preshock density of the interstellar clouds are of the order of a few atoms per @xmath40 while the asca x - ray data suggest an average insterstellar medium density of @xmath3 0.5 . based on our upper limits",
    ", it is estimated that the density contrast between the ism clouds and the ism medium is less than @xmath3 5 .",
    "the absence of radio emission from the main body of the infrared and hi expanding shells is conspicuous and surprising , especially as these shells are reported to be very massive ( koo  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the area covered by the 1410 mhz radio emission and the optical radiation detected in the south and south  east indicate that the accelerated shock front has traversed the hi cavity and is interacting with its walls .",
    "more sensitive radio observations at 1410 mhz would be required to establish the relation of the optical structures in the south of , and the actual size of the remnant which is a crucial parameter for the further modeling of this remnant .",
    "an extended diffuse structure is detected in the south  east well away from the faintest radio contours which overlaps soft x - ray emission detected by rosat .",
