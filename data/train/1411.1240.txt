    "in nuclear systems , an important feature is the independent single particle motion in a self - consistent mean field . as a result of spin - orbit splitting coming from the one - body spin - orbit potential ,",
    "the @xmath7-coupling shell model has been able to explain the nature of various nuclei .",
    "another important feature is the development of clusters .",
    "usually , well - developed cluster structures appear in excited states close to their cluster decay thresholds , as predicted by the ikeda s threshold rule  @xcite .    in light nuclei",
    ", it is known that cluster formation occurs in low - lying states and competes with the shell - model structure .",
    "@xmath1c is a typical example of this competition  @xcite . because the spin - orbit force usually tends to hinder the cluster formation ,",
    "the ground state of @xmath1c is not the pure 3@xmath0 cluster state but is a mixture of 3@xmath0 cluster structure and @xmath7-coupling shell model structure of the @xmath2 subshell closure ; this is supported by the large level spacing between @xmath8 and @xmath9 states . on the other hand , in excited states of @xmath1c near the threshold energy , developed 3@xmath0 cluster structures have been discovered .",
    "it is important to understand the magnitude of this competition and how much it affects the structures of the ground and excited states of @xmath1c . to clarify this problem ,",
    "it is necessary to have a theoretical model that can describe cluster structures incorporating cluster breaking effects .",
    "nevertheless , many studies have investigated the cluster structures of @xmath1c using 3@xmath0 cluster models without considering cluster breaking . in the following , we review studies of structures of @xmath1c on the basis of various theoretical approaches and introduce recent developments in experimental works .    in 3@xmath0 cluster models ,",
    "the ground and low - lying states have a compact triangle structure , whereas excited states near and above the 3@xmath0 cluster threshold energy have well - developed cluster structures   @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath10 state , which is well - known as the hoyle state , is considered to be an @xmath0 condensate state in which weakly interacting three @xmath0 clusters occupy an identical lowest orbit of a mean - field potential  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation was indicated by the so - called tohsaki - horiuchi - schuck - rpke ( thsr ) wave function .",
    "the cluster developed structure in the @xmath4 state is also experimentally supported by a quite large monopole transition strength  @xcite .",
    "another interesting cluster structure was predicted in the @xmath5 state , which is considered to be a vibration mode of acute and obtuse triangle configurations  @xcite . however",
    ", 3@xmath0 cluster models can not describe the detailed properties of ground and excited states of @xmath1c because they ignore the components of @xmath0-cluster breaking caused by the spin - orbit force .",
    "for example , the excitation energy of the @xmath9 state is underestimated .    in the no - core shell model calculation , which is one of the _ ab initio _ calculations ,",
    "many states of @xmath1c are reproduced well  @xcite .",
    "however , the model fails to reproduce some states observed near the cluster threshold such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 states .",
    "this seems to be reasonable because these states are cluster developed states in which large proportion of nucleons are distributed over many harmonic oscillator orbits . to describe these cluster developed states ,",
    "a model space is required that is significantly larger than those used in the usual no - core shell model calculation  @xcite .",
    "another _ ab initio _",
    "calculation for @xmath1c has been performed using the chiral effective field theory  @xcite . however , quantitative reproduction of structure properties , such as radii , was not satisfactory even though the calculation reproduced some experimental data such as excitation energies and @xmath11 transition strengths . for detailed discussion of cluster structures , further developments are required .    the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) and the fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) models have been successful in describing the nature of @xmath1c from the ground state to the higher excited states  @xcite . in these models , the ground and low - lying states are a mixture of cluster and @xmath7-coupling shell model configurations .",
    "because of this mixing , these models reproduce well the excitation energy of the @xmath9 state and @xmath11 transition strengths between the low - lying states . for states near the threshold , these models reproduce the cluster nature , but the detailed cluster structures obtained with these models are somewhat different from those of cluster model results . for example , the radius of the @xmath4 state can be somewhat smaller than that predicted by the cluster model , although both the models reproduce the monopole transition strength  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 state is considered to be a chain - like structure having an obtuse triangle configuration of three @xmath0 clusters instead of the vibrational state predicted by the cluster model .",
    "the capability of reproducing the experimental data of @xmath1c is a significant advantage of amd and fmd .",
    "recently , several interesting experimental data on @xmath1c for excited states near the threshold energy have been reported .",
    "a new state , the @xmath6 state at 9.84 mev , was discovered  @xcite . the @xmath12 transition strength from this @xmath6 state to the ground state",
    "was measured to be 1.57@xmath13 e@xmath14@xmath15  @xcite , which many models fail to reproduce .",
    "_ found that the broad @xmath3 state at 10 mev consists of two @xmath3 states  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the existence of two @xmath3 states above the @xmath4 state was predicted by kurokawa and kat  @xcite and also shown by ohtsubo _",
    "_ @xcite using the orthogonal condition model and the complex scaling method ( ocm+csm ) .",
    "a band structure including these new states has been an open problem . in particular , the assignment of the band - head state of the newly measured @xmath6 state is now controversial .    in this paper , we investigate @xmath1c with a simple model to clarify @xmath0-cluster breaking effects on 3@xmath0 cluster structures . in this model , we superpose the brink - bloch ( bb ) cluster model wave functions and the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function to incorporate the mixing of cluster breaking components in cluster structures .",
    "this model is regarded as an extension of the generator coordinate method of a cluster model .",
    "the difference from traditional cluster models is the mixing of the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function , which is the lowest configuration of the @xmath7-coupling shell model .",
    "the results obtained with this model are consistent with the amd and fmd results even though it is much simpler than those models . in this model space , we changed the strength of the spin - orbit force by hand to control the mixing of the @xmath0-cluster breaking component , i.e. , the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function .",
    "we found that the mixing of the @xmath0-cluster breaking component significantly changes the cluster configurations and band structure of excited states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ formulation ] , we explain the wave function and hamiltonian used in the present study . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we show calculated results . in sec",
    ".  [ discussion ] , we discuss differences in cluster configurations in @xmath3 states and band structure between calculations with and without @xmath0-cluster breaking .",
    "we compare our results with other theoretical calculations .",
    "finally , we summarize the findings of the present study in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "in this work , we investigate @xmath1c using a simple model that combines the bb cluster model with the lowest wave function of the @xmath7-coupling shell model . we superpose many 3@xmath0 bb wave functions and the single @xmath2 subshell closure wave function .",
    "the bb wave function  @xcite for three @xmath0 clusters is written as @xmath16,\\ ] ] @xmath17 @xmath18 ,   \\label{eq : brink_single}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is a real vector that indicates the position of the @xmath20th @xmath0 cluster .",
    "for the width parameter , we use the value @xmath21 @xmath22 same as that used in the previous study of @xmath1c using amd  @xcite .",
    "this parameter was originally from a variational calculation for the ground state of @xmath23be in ref .",
    "the configuration of the bb wave function is characterized by the distances between @xmath0 clusters , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the bending angle , @xmath26 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : configuration ] . because of symmetry , we can limit distances to @xmath27 without loss of generality . to describe relative motions of clusters sufficiently ,",
    "we generate 252 bb wave functions by taking the distance @xmath28 fm and the bending angle @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "to describe the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function , we adopted the method proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this method ,",
    "the single particle wave function is described by a gaussian wave packet in the same manner as in the bb wave function eq .  .",
    "however , the center of the wave packet for the @xmath31th nucleon belonging to the @xmath20th @xmath0 cluster is replaced by a complex parameter @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a unit vector for the intrinsic spin direction of the @xmath31th nucleon . in the limit of @xmath35 ,",
    "this wave function describes the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function . for the width parameter of the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function",
    ", we use the same value @xmath21 @xmath22 of the bb wave function to exactly separate the center - of - mass motion from the total wave function .    as the final wave function , we superpose the 252 3@xmath0 bb wave functions and the single @xmath2 subshell closure wave function with the parity and angular momentum projection , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the parity and angular momentum projection operator .",
    "the coefficients are determined by the diagonalization of the norm and hamiltonian matrices .",
    "the superposition of bb wave functions without the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function corresponds to the traditional 3@xmath0 cluster gcm calculation without @xmath0-cluster breaking . in the present model , @xmath0-cluster breaking caused by the spin - orbit force",
    "is incorporated by adding the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function to the 3@xmath0 cluster model space .",
    "note that the final wave functions for the non - zero angular momentum states are the same as those obtained by the 3@xmath0 cluster gcm calculation because the single @xmath2 subshell closure wave function is a @xmath38 eigenstate ; therefore , @xmath39 vanishes for @xmath40 .",
    "in other words , the @xmath0-cluster breaking caused by the spin - orbit force affects only the @xmath3 states through the mixing of the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function .    in the present work ,",
    "we omit cluster breaking components for the @xmath40 states because they give only minor effect compared with the significant cluster breaking effects in the @xmath38 states .",
    "indeed , the structure of the cluster developed states does not change qualitatively even if we adopt the cluster breaking components for the @xmath40 states . to simplify the discussion ,",
    "we adopt only the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function , which gives the major contribution of the @xmath0-cluster breaking effect .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of the kinetic energy @xmath41 , effective central force @xmath42 , effective spin - orbit force @xmath43 , and coulomb force @xmath44 , @xmath45 where the center - of - mass kinetic energy @xmath46 is subtracted . for the effective central force",
    ", we used the volkov no .  2 force  @xcite with majorana parameter @xmath47 .",
    "for the effective spin - orbit force , we used the spin - orbit term of the g3rs interaction  @xcite , @xmath48 \\hat{p}(^{3 } \\text{o } ) \\hat{\\bm{l } } \\cdot \\hat{\\bm{s}},\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is a projection operator onto the triplet odd state .",
    "we chose @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the strength of the spin - orbit force .",
    "we used the same interaction with @xmath52 mev as that used in a previous study of @xmath1c using amd  @xcite .",
    "we also investigate the @xmath51 dependence of energy levels and the degree of @xmath0-cluster breaking by changing the strength @xmath51 from 0 mev to 3200 mev .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : levels_0+_2 + ] , we show the energy levels of @xmath3 and @xmath53 states calculated with the present model using @xmath52 mev , which is the same strength used in our previous study of @xmath1c using amd  @xcite , and those obtained with the @xmath54-cluster gcm calculation .",
    "the former and the latter correspond to calculations with and without @xmath0-cluster breaking , i.e. , the mixing of the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function caused by the spin - orbit force , which we call `` 3@xmath0+@xmath2 '' and `` 3@xmath0 '' , respectively .",
    "experimental data are taken from refs .",
    "energies are measured from the @xmath54 threshold energy .",
    "the theoretical and experimental threshold energies are @xmath55 mev and @xmath56 mev , respectively .    in the `` 3@xmath0 '' case ,",
    "the spin - orbit force provides zero energy contribution because the expectation value of the spin - orbit force vanishes in the pure @xmath54 cluster model space . in the `` 3@xmath0+@xmath2 '' result ,",
    "the @xmath53 states are completely the same as those of the `` 3@xmath0 '' result , but the @xmath3 energies are decreased by the spin - orbit force because of the mixing of the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function . the results for `` 3@xmath0+@xmath2 '' agree with experimental results very well except for the absence of a @xmath3 state observed around 10 mev .",
    "in particular , the level spacing between @xmath8 and @xmath9 states of `` 3@xmath0+@xmath2 '' agrees well with the experimental one , which is largely underestimated in `` 3@xmath0 '' .",
    "this large spacing comes from the energy gain of the spin - orbit force in the @xmath8 state with the mixing of the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function .",
    "any microscopic @xmath0 cluster model fails to reproduce this large level spacing , and therefore , this is an evidence for @xmath0-cluster breaking .    as shown later ,",
    "the `` 3@xmath0+@xmath2 '' result is qualitatively consistent with the amd and fmd results for @xmath1c .",
    "this implies that the major difference between the amd and fmd results and 3@xmath0 cluster model calculations is the @xmath0-cluster breaking effect , which can be qualitatively simulated by the mixing of only one configuration of the @xmath2 subshell closure to the @xmath54 cluster model space in the present model . in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] , we discuss in detail the structure differences between @xmath3 states with and without @xmath0-cluster breaking .    as mentioned above , @xmath0-cluster breaking caused by the spin - orbit force gives a significant effect in @xmath1c . to clarify the mechanism of the mixing of the @xmath0-cluster breaking component",
    ", we consider the dependence of @xmath3 states on the strength of the spin - orbit force by changing the strength parameter @xmath51 from 0 mev to 3200 mev in the present model .",
    "the calculation using @xmath57 mev is equivalent to the `` 3@xmath0 '' calculation . as the strength of the spin - orbit force increases , @xmath3 energy levels change due to @xmath0-cluster breaking , i.e. , the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : level_ls_dependence ] , we show the change in energy levels of @xmath3 states against the strength of the spin - orbit force @xmath51 . the energy of the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function is also shown for reference . for @xmath58 mev ,",
    "the energies are almost independent of the strength of the spin - orbit force . in this region , the energy levels and wave functions themselves are almost equal to those obtained from the pure cluster model calculation without @xmath0-cluster breaking .",
    "when @xmath59 mev , the @xmath3 levels except for the lowest one do not depend on the strength of the spin - orbit force ; however , the energy of the lowest @xmath3 state linearly decreases and shows almost the same @xmath51 dependence as that of the @xmath2 subshell closure state .",
    "these imply that structures of the states do not change when the strength of the spin - orbit force is extremely weak or strong .",
    "however , around @xmath52 mev , energy levels depend on the strength @xmath51 because of level crossings of the cluster states and the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function . in this transient region , a change in the wave function occurs for each state .",
    ".percentages of squared overlaps between @xmath3 gcm wave functions and the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function for @xmath60 mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table  [ table : comparison_e2 ] , we compare @xmath11 transition strengths from the present results with those from several theoretical models .",
    "the labels in the table are the same as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_levels ] .",
    "the microscopic @xmath0-cluster models without @xmath0-cluster breaking tend to overestimate the @xmath61 transition strengths , whereas models with @xmath0-cluster breaking reproduce it properly . for the reproduction of the @xmath62 transition strength , the present 3@xmath0+@xmath2 agrees with the experimental data better than the other models .",
    "the @xmath11 transition strengths from the @xmath6 state are important for determining the band assignment for this state , as discussed before .",
    "although the @xmath6 state has strong @xmath11 transitions to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states , the major transition differs between calculations with and without @xmath0-cluster breaking .",
    "the @xmath63 transition strength is significantly larger than the @xmath64 one in the @xmath65 and amd calculations with @xmath0-cluster breaking .",
    "however , the relation of strengths is opposite and the @xmath64 transition is dominant in the 3@xmath0 and thsr calculations without @xmath0-cluster breaking .",
    "this implies that the band - head of the @xmath6 state is changed from the @xmath4 state to the @xmath5 state by @xmath0-cluster breaking .",
    "this difference between calculations with and without @xmath0-cluster breaking comes from the difference of cluster configurations in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states due to @xmath0-cluster breaking . as explained above , with @xmath0-cluster breaking , the cluster development of the @xmath4 state",
    "is reduced to decrease the @xmath11 transition from the @xmath6 state . moreover ,",
    "the structure of the @xmath5 state changes from the vibration mode of acute and obtuse triangle configurations of three @xmath0 clusters to a chain - like open triangle structure .",
    "therefore , the phase with the @xmath6 becomes more coherent in the results with @xmath0-cluster breaking .",
    "we stress that @xmath0-cluster breaking caused by the spin - orbit force has significant effects on transition strengths and changes band structure .",
    "this implies that , to investigate structures of excited cluster states in @xmath1c , it is important to consider @xmath0-cluster breaking , in particular , mixing of the @xmath2 subshell closure configuration in @xmath3 states .      in the results with @xmath0-cluster breaking , we assigned the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states as the band members because of the major @xmath11 transition as discussed above . since the results with @xmath0-cluster breaking reproduce the experimental data such as the large level spacing between @xmath8 and @xmath9 states , rms - radii , and @xmath11 transition strengths between low - lying states well , we consider the @xmath5 state is likely to be the band - head of the @xmath6 , although there is no experimental data for the @xmath11 transitions from the @xmath6 state to the @xmath4 state and the @xmath5 state .    strictly speaking , the structure of the @xmath6 state is different from that of the @xmath5 state because of 16% of the @xmath0-cluster breaking component in the @xmath5 state ( see table  [ table : squared_overlap_p3/2 ] ) .",
    "it means that they are not an ideal rotational band constructed from an intrinsic state .",
    "however , when we project the structures on the 3@xmath0 cluster configuration space , we found that both of @xmath5 and @xmath6 states have maximum amplitude around obtuse triangle region . considering these points ,",
    "the stronger @xmath11 transition strength and maximum amplitude around the chain - like open triangle structure , this band can be considered a linear chain - like band .    in this band ,",
    "the energy position of the @xmath5 state is slightly higher than that of the @xmath6 state in the present calculation with @xmath0-cluster breaking .",
    "the order of the @xmath3 state and the @xmath53 state is reverse to an ordinary rotational band .",
    "this may come from the mixing of the intrinsic structure of the @xmath4 state in the @xmath6 state , though the dominant component of the @xmath6 state is the intrinsic structure of the @xmath5 state .",
    "this can be understood from that the @xmath11 transition from the @xmath6 state is not weak to the @xmath4 state though the strength is relatively smaller than that to the @xmath5 state .",
    "to clarify @xmath0-cluster breaking effects on 3@xmath0 cluster structures in @xmath1c , we investigated @xmath1c with a hybrid model composed of the bb cluster model and the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function .",
    "we superposed 252 bb wave functions to sufficiently describe the relative motions of clusters .",
    "the @xmath0-cluster breaking caused by the spin - orbit force affects @xmath3 states through the mixing of the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function .",
    "the present result reproduces well the experimental results with the significant mixing of @xmath0-cluster breaking .",
    "we have found that @xmath0-cluster breaking significantly changes the cluster structures of @xmath3 states through orthogonality to lower states . as a result of the structure changes of @xmath3 states , the band assignment for the @xmath6 state is changed . to investigate @xmath0-cluster breaking effects , we compared 3@xmath0 configurations contained in @xmath3 states obtained from calculations with and without @xmath0-cluster breaking .    in calculations with and without @xmath0-cluster breaking ,",
    "the @xmath8 state has a compact @xmath54 cluster structure as the dominant component and also contains components of developed cluster configurations .",
    "however , in the calculation with @xmath0-cluster breaking , 3@xmath0 cluster components becomes relatively small because of significant mixing of the @xmath2 subshell closure component .    in both the calculations ,",
    "the @xmath4 state is described by the superposition of various triangle configurations of three @xmath0 clusters . however , in the calculation with @xmath0-cluster breaking , the spatial development of the cluster structure and the gas - like feature of the @xmath4 state are slightly reduced .",
    "orthogonality to the @xmath8 state can not hinder the @xmath4 state including more compact @xmath0 cluster components because the 3@xmath0 cluster component in the @xmath8 state decreases with @xmath0-cluster breaking .",
    "because of @xmath0-cluster breaking , the structure of the @xmath5 state changes from the vibration mode of acute and obtuse triangle configurations to the chain - like open triangle structure .",
    "the components of acute triangle configurations increases in the @xmath4 state ; therefore , the @xmath5 state loses components of acute triangle configurations because of orthogonality to the @xmath4 state .    because of structure changes of @xmath3 states by @xmath0-cluster breaking , transition strengths change significantly .",
    "the band assignment for the @xmath6 state differs between calculations with and without @xmath0-cluster breaking .",
    "namely , in the model calculation without @xmath0-cluster breaking , the @xmath4 state is assigned to be the band - head of the @xmath6 state . however , when we incorporate @xmath0-cluster breaking caused by the spin - orbit force , the @xmath5 state is regarded as the band - head of the @xmath6 state .",
    "the @xmath5 state is likely to be the band - head of the @xmath6 state instead of the @xmath4 state because the present calculation reproduces experimental data of the low - lying states well with @xmath0-cluster breaking .",
    "considering the stronger @xmath11 transition strength and maximum amplitude around the chain - like open triangle structure , this band can be considered a linear chain - like band .",
    "unfortunately , there is no experimental data for the @xmath11 transitions from the @xmath6 state to excited @xmath3 states .",
    "moreover , experimental information about two @xmath66 states around 10 mev is not enough to assign the theoretical @xmath5 state to either of the experimental @xmath3 states .",
    "further experimental data related to @xmath3 and @xmath53 states in this energy region are required to clarify the band assignment of these states .",
    "we stress that @xmath0-cluster breaking caused by the spin - orbit force gives significant effect on cluster structures , transition strengths , and band structure . to investigate structures of excited cluster states in @xmath1c , it is important to consider @xmath0-cluster breaking , in particular , mixing of the @xmath2 subshell closure configuration in @xmath3 states .",

    "<S> to clarify the effects of @xmath0-cluster breaking on 3@xmath0 cluster structures in @xmath1c , we investigate @xmath1c using a hybrid model that combines the brink - bloch cluster model with the @xmath2 subshell closure wave function . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that @xmath0-cluster breaking caused by spin - orbit force significantly changes cluster structures of excited @xmath3 states through orthogonality to lower states . </S>",
    "<S> spatially developed cluster components of the @xmath4 state are reduced . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 state changes from a vibration mode in the bending motion of three @xmath0 clusters to a chain - like 3@xmath0 structure having an open triangle configuration . as a result of these structure changes of @xmath3 states , the band assignment for the @xmath6 state is changed by the @xmath0-cluster breaking effect . </S>",
    "<S> namely , in model calculations without the @xmath0-cluster breaking effect , the @xmath4 state is assigned to be the band - head of the @xmath6 state . however , when we incorporate @xmath0-cluster breaking caused by the spin - orbit force , the @xmath5 state is regarded as the band - head of the @xmath6 state . </S>"
