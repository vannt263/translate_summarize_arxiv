    "it is now well established that the centers of most galaxies host supermassive black holes ( bh ) with masses in the range @xmath4 @xcite . the evidence is particularly compelling for a bh of mass @xmath5 at the center of our own galaxy @xcite .",
    "dynamical estimates indicate that , across a wide range , the central bh mass is about 0.1% of the spheroidal component of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "a related correlation may exist with the total gravitational mass of the host galaxy ( basically the mass of its dark matter halo ) @xcite .",
    "an even tighter correlation is observed between the central velocity dispersion and the central bh mass @xcite .",
    "theoretical arguments and recent observations suggest that a central bh may also exist in some globular clusters @xcite .",
    "in particular , recent hst observations and dynamical modeling of m15 by @xcite yielded results that are consistent with the presence of a central massive bh in this cluster .",
    "similarly @xcite have argued for the existence of an even more massive bh at the center of the globular cluster g1 in m31 . however , @xmath2-body simulations @xcite suggest that the observations of m15 and g1 could be explained equally well by the presence of many compact objects near the center without a massive bh @xcite .",
    "when the correlation between the mass of the central bh and the spheroidal component in galaxies is extrapolated to smaller stellar systems like globular clusters , the inferred bh masses are @xmath6 , much larger than a @xmath7 stellar - mass bh , but much smaller than the @xmath8 of supermassive bh .",
    "hence , these are called _ intermediate - mass black holes _ ( imbh ) . if some globular clusters do host a central imbh the question arises of how these objects were formed ( for recent reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one natural path for their formation in any young stellar system with a high enough density is through runaway collisions and mergers of massive stars following core collapse . these runaways could easily occur in a variety of observed young star clusters such as the `` young populous clusters '' like the arches and quintuplet clusters in our galactic center and the `` super star clusters '' observed in all starburst and galactic merger environments ( see , e.g. , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the pistol star in the quintuplet cluster @xcite may be the product of such a runaway , as demonstrated recently by direct @xmath2-body simulations @xcite .",
    "a similar process may be responsible for the formation of seed bh in proto - galactic nuclei , which could then grow by gas accretion or by merging with other imbh formed in young star clusters @xcite .",
    "further observational evidence for imbh in dense star clusters comes from recent _ chandra _ and xmm-_newton _ observations of ultra - luminous x - ray sources , which are often ( although not always ) associated with young star clusters and whose high x - ray luminosities in many cases suggest a compact object mass of at least @xmath9 @xcite , although beamed emission by an accreting stellar - mass bh provides an alternative explanation @xcite .",
    "when they are born , star clusters are expected to contain many young stars with a wide range of masses , from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , distributed according to a salpeter - like initial mass function ( imf ) @xcite .",
    "inspired by an early version from @xcite for the formation of supermassive bh , we show in figure  [ fig_rees_diag ] a diagram illustrating the two main scenarios leading to the formation of an imbh at the center of a dense star cluster .",
    "the early stages of dynamical evolution are dominated by the stars in the upper part of the mass spectrum . through dynamical friction ,",
    "these heavy stars tend to concentrate toward the center and drive the system to core collapse .",
    "successive collisions and mergers of the massive stars during core collapse can then lead to a runaway process and the rapid formation of a very massive object containing the entire mass of the collapsing cluster core .",
    "although the fate of such a massive merger remnant is rather uncertain , direct `` monolithic '' collapse to a bh with no or little mass loss is a likely outcome , at least for sufficiently small metallicities @xcite .",
    "an essential condition for this runaway to occur is that the core collapse must occur before the most massive stars born in the cluster end their lives in supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "the accumulation at the center of a galaxy of many imbh produced through this runaway process in nearby young star clusters ( like the arches and quintuplet clusters in our galaxy ) provides an interesting new way of building up the mass of a central supermassive bh @xcite .",
    "it is possible that this process of accumulation is still ongoing in our own galaxy @xcite .",
    "these ideas have potentially important implications for the study of supermassive bh by the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) , since the inspiral of imbh into a supermassive bh provides the best source of low - frequency gravitational waves for direct study of strong field gravity @xcite .    in the alternative scenario where massive stars evolve and produce supernovae",
    "before the cluster goes into core collapse , a subsystem of stellar - mass bh will be formed ( figure  [ fig_rees_diag ] ) .",
    "as demonstrated in section  [ subsec_stell_evol ] , the mass loss from supernovae provides significant indirect heating of the cluster core , delaying the onset of core collapse until much later , after the stellar remnants undergo mass segregation .",
    "the final fate of a cluster with a component of stellar - mass bh remains highly uncertain .",
    "this is because realistic dynamical simulations for such clusters ( containing a large number of black holes _ and _ ordinary stars with a realistic mass spectrum ) have yet to be performed . for old and relatively small systems ( such as galactic globular clusters ) , complete evaporation is likely ( with all the stellar - mass bh ejected from the cluster through 3-body and 4-body interactions in the dense core ) .",
    "this is expected theoretically on the basis of simple qualitative arguments @xcite and has been demonstrated recently by direct @xmath2-body simulations for very small systems containing only @xmath12 bh @xcite . however , for larger systems ( more massive globular clusters or proto - galactic nuclei ) , contraction of the cluster to a highly relativistic state could again lead to successive mergers ( driven by gravitational radiation ) and the formation of a single massive bh @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been recently suggested that , if stellar - mass bh are formed with a broad mass spectrum ( a likely outcome for stars of very low metallicity ; see @xcite ) , the most massive bh could resist ejection , even in a system with low escape velocity such as a globular cluster .",
    "these more massive bh could then grow by repeatedly forming binaries ( through exchange interactions ) with other bh and merging with their companions @xcite .",
    "however , as most interactions will probably result in the ejection of one of the lighter bh , it is unclear whether any object could grow substantially through this mechanism before running out of companions to merge with .",
    "the physics of gravothermal contraction and core collapse is by now very well understood for _ single - component _ systems ( containing all equal - mass stars ) .",
    "in particular , the dynamical evolution of an isolated , single - component plummer sphere to core collapse has been studied extensively and has become a testbed for all numerical codes used to compute the evolution of dense star clusters @xcite",
    ". this evolution can be visualized easily using lagrange radii , enclosing a fixed fraction of the total mass of the system ( see , e.g. , fig .  3 of * ?",
    "* and fig .  5 of ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the system evolves , the inner lagrange radii contract while the outer ones expand .",
    "this so - called gravothermal contraction results from the negative heat capacity that is a common property of all gravitationally bound systems @xcite . in the absence of an energy source in the cluster core , and in the point - mass limit ( i.e. , neglecting physical collisions between stars )",
    ", the contraction of the cluster core becomes self - similar and continues indefinitely .",
    "this phenomenon is known as core collapse and its universality is very well established ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* table  1 and references therein ) .    when the system contains stars with a variety of masses , the evolution to core collapse is accelerated .",
    "this has been demonstrated by the earliest @xmath2-body and monte carlo simulations @xcite . to illustrate this behavior , and as a preview of the results presented later in sec .",
    "4 , we show in figure  [ fig_cc_compare ] the evolution of a cluster described initially by a simple plummer model containing @xmath13 stars with a broad salpeter imf between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "core collapse occurs after @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the initial half - mass relaxation time ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq_rel_time ] ) below ) . in sharp contrast ,",
    "core collapse in a single - component plummer model occurs after @xmath18 ( a well - known result ) .",
    "thus the presence of a broad imf can dramatically accelerate the evolution of the cluster to core collapse .",
    "this acceleration of the evolution to core collapse is due to the changing nature of energy transfer in the presence of a wide mass spectrum .",
    "relaxation processes tend to establish energy equipartition ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "8.4 ) . in a cluster where the masses of the stars are nearly equal",
    ", this can be ( very nearly ) achieved .",
    "the core collapse is then a result of energy transfer from the inner to the outer parts of the cluster , leading to gravothermal contraction @xcite .",
    "a large difference between the masses of the stars allows a more efficient mechanism for energy transfer . in this case",
    ", energy equipartition would tend to bring the heavier stars to lower speeds .",
    "however , as a result , the heavier stars sink to the center , where they tend to gain kinetic energy , while the lighter stars move to the outer halo .",
    "this process is called `` mass segregation . '' as the mass segregation proceeds , the core contracts and gets denser , leading to a shorter relaxation time , which in turn increases the rate of energy transfer from heavier to lighter stars . in typical cases",
    "this evolution eventually makes the heavier stars evolve _ away _ from equipartition @xcite .",
    "the fundamental inability of the heavier stars to establish energy equipartition with the lighter stars in a system with a continuous mass spectrum is similar to the spitzer `` mass - segregation instability '' in two - component clusters .",
    "@xcite , using analytic methods and a number of simplifying assumptions , determined a simple criterion for a two - component system to achieve energy equipartition in equilibrium .",
    "if the mass of the lighter ( heavier ) stars is @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and the total mass in the light ( heavy ) component is @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , then spitzer s criterion can be written @xmath23 @xcite , using numerical simulations , obtained a more accurate empirical condition , @xmath24 when this stability criterion is not satisfied , energy equipartition can not be established between heavy and light stars .",
    "@xcite noted that the equilibrium would not be achieved for realistic mass spectra , because there is always sufficient mass in high - mass stars that , through mass segregation , they can form a subsystem ( near the center of the cluster ) that decouples dynamically from the lower - mass stars .",
    "this was later supported by more detailed theoretical studies @xcite .    here",
    "we carry out a simple calculation to show that a typical system , with a salpeter imf ( see sec .",
    "3.2 ) extending from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , when viewed as a two - component cluster of `` light stars '' and `` heavy stars , '' does not satisfy any of the simple stability criteria .",
    "let us separate the stars into these two components according to some arbitrary boundary : we group all stars lighter than @xmath27 in the first component , and all stars heavier than @xmath27 in the second component .",
    "we use @xmath19 and @xmath21 to denote the values of the average and total mass in the first component , and @xmath20 and @xmath22 similarly for the second component .",
    "we obtain , with @xmath27 in solar mass , @xmath28 when these values are used in equations ( [ eqn_spitzer ] ) and ( [ eqn_watters ] ) we see ( figure  [ fig_ins ] ) that the stability criteria are almost never satisfied for any value of @xmath27 , except when it is extremely close to the maximum mass ( as expected , since the model reduces artificially to a single - component system in this limit , with all stars having the average mass ) .",
    "@xcite , devised a criterion genuinely adapted to clusters with a continuous mass spectrum , under the _ ad - hoc _ assumption that the shape of the density distribution does not depend on the stellar mass .",
    "he derives the following necessary condition for stability : @xmath29 for all @xmath27 ( his eq .",
    "figure  [ fig_ins ] shows that this condition can not be satisfied either ( see sec .  [ subsec_mass_fcts ] ) is required for central equipartition to set in before core collapse while vishniac s criterion predicts that @xmath30 is sufficient . ] .",
    "these results suggest that for any salpeter - like imf , one can always find a collection of stars that have large enough average and total mass that they will dynamically decouple from the lighter stars in the cluster .",
    "once these decouple they form a subsystem with a much shorter relaxation time and consequently evolve to core collapse very rapidly .",
    "the half - mass relaxation time ( relaxation time at the half - mass radius @xmath31 ) for a cluster of @xmath2 stars is given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  2.63 ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mass density and @xmath34 in the coulomb logarithm .",
    "let us assume that a collapsing subsystem is formed by stars that constitute 1% of the total mass , and that all of them come from the uppermost part of the mass spectrum . for a salpeter imf with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the number of stars in this subsystem is then @xmath35 . at the time of dynamical decoupling the central density of the subsystem must be comparable to the central density of the overall cluster .",
    "therefore we conclude that the relaxation time is around three orders of magnitude smaller for the collapsing subsystem of heavy stars at the onset of instability .",
    "so , essentially , the heavy stars will go into core collapse as soon as they start dominating the mass density near the center .",
    "if the cluster starts its evolution with heavy stars distributed throughout , the timescale for core collapse will be determined by their mass segregation timescale .",
    "the process of mass segregation for the heaviest stars in the cluster is driven by dynamical friction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  7.1 ) .",
    "the timescale for mass segregation and the onset of core collapse therefore depends primarily on the mass ratio between the dominant heavy stars and the lighter background stars @xcite . for simple dynamical friction in an effective two - component model",
    ", one would then expect the core collapse time to be comparable to @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath27 ( @xmath37 , the upper mass limit of the imf ) should be the mass above which the imf contains a large enough number of massive stars to define a `` collapsing subsystem . ''",
    "if this number is @xmath38 and the total number of stars @xmath39 we get @xmath40 for our standard salpeter imf and this simple analysis would then predict the correct order of magnitude for the core collapse time ( @xmath41 ; see figure  [ fig_cc_compare ] ) .",
    "note , however , that this simple dynamical friction picture corresponds to one or a few massive objects traveling through a uniform background of much lighter particles , a description that provides , at best , only a rough approximation of the real situation under consideration here ( see appendix ) .      in this paper ,",
    "the first of a series , we consider a wide variety of initial cluster models and we investigate the evolution of all systems until the onset of core collapse .",
    "results from numerical simulations that include stellar collisions and track the growth of a massive object through successive mergers of massive stars during core collapse will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "this work is in progress and preliminary results have already been reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we determine how the core collapse time is related to various initial parameters including the imf ( sec .",
    "3.2 and  4.2 ) and the central concentration and tidal radius of the cluster ( sec .  3.1 and  4.3 ) , and we also include the possibility of initial mass segregation ( sec .  3.3 and  4.4 ) .",
    "we then make a comparison with the stellar evolution time and derive limits on cluster initial conditions to allow the development of runaway collisions and the possible subsequent formation of a central massive bh ( sec .",
    "we also derive from our calculations an estimate of the total mass of the stars that participate in the runaway collisions , which provides an upper limit to the final bh mass .",
    "we do not include stellar evolution in our calculations since our aim here is to investigate dynamical processes taking place before even the most massive main - sequence stars in the cluster have evolved .",
    "we do , however , study the effects of mass loss from stellar winds and their dependence on metallicity ( sec .",
    "[ subsec_stell_evol ] ) . in a subsequent paper @xcite",
    ", we will study the evolution of `` post - collapse '' star clusters in which a central imbh is assumed to have formed early on ( through the runaway collision process ) .",
    "in particular , we will study the possibility that mass loss from the stellar evolution of the remaining massive stars ( those that have escaped the central collapse and runaway ) could disrupt the cluster ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) , thereby producing a `` naked '' imbh .",
    "this is motivated by observations of ultraluminous x - ray sources in regions of active star formation ( e.g. , in merging galaxies ) containing many young star clusters , but with the x - ray sources found predominantly _ outside _ of those clusters @xcite .",
    "an important factor that could affect significantly the dynamics of core collapse in young star clusters is the presence of primordial binaries @xcite or the dynamical formation of binaries through three - body interactions @xcite . as pointed out by @xcite , the formation rate of hard three - body binaries",
    "would be accelerated in clusters with a mass spectrum @xcite . in this first paper",
    "we do not take into account the presence of binaries in the cluster .",
    "this is justified because we do not expect binaries to play an important role until after the onset of core collapse , when the central density increases suddenly .",
    "however , collisions should become dominant immediately after the onset of core collapse .",
    "our expectation , based on several previous theoretical studies of physical collisions during interactions of hard primordial binaries and for three - body binary formation , is that the presence of binaries in the core will in fact _ increase _ collision rates , thereby helping to trigger the runaway @xcite .",
    "this is also supported by the results of direct @xmath2-body simulations showing that , in smaller systems containing @xmath42 single stars , collisions indeed occur predominantly through the interactions of three - body binaries formed at core collapse @xcite .",
    "numerical methods for investigating the dynamical evolution of star clusters include direct @xmath2-body integration , solutions of the fokker - planck equation by direct ( finite - difference ) or monte carlo methods , and gaseous models ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "here we refer to direct @xmath2-body integrations simply as `` @xmath2-body simulations , '' direct integrations of the fokker - planck equation as `` fokker - planck ( fp ) simulations , '' and fokker - planck simulations based on monte carlo techniques as `` monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . ''",
    "note , however , that our mc simulations , in which the cluster is modeled on a star - by - star basis , are in fact another type of `` @xmath2-body simulations . ''",
    "each approach offers different advantages and disadvantages for understanding core collapse and massive black hole formation in star clusters with a realistic mass spectrum .",
    "@xcite carried out @xmath2-body simulations starting from a variety of initial conditions for clusters containing up to @xmath43 stars .",
    "they found that runaway collisions driven by the most massive stars can happen in sufficiently dense clusters .",
    "their results apply directly to small star clusters containing @xmath44 stars .",
    "however , in such a small cluster , any realistic imf typically contains only a very small number of massive stars .",
    "for example , a salpeter imf with minimum mass @xmath14 and maximum mass @xmath15 contains a fraction @xmath45 of its stars above @xmath46 . the dynamical role played by massive stars",
    "can therefore depend strongly on the total number of stars in the cluster .",
    "in addition , in small systems , the dynamical evolution might be dominated by the random behavior or the initial conditions of just a few very massive stars .",
    "consequently , to investigate runaway collisions in larger systems such as super star clusters or proto - galactic nuclei , realistically large numbers of stars must be used in numerical simulations . the computational time required for direct integration of an @xmath2-body system over one crossing time @xmath47 scales as @xmath48 ( @xmath49 on parallel machines ,",
    "if one can adjust the number of cpus to @xmath2 optimally ; see @xcite ) . since the relaxation time is @xmath50 ( see sec .",
    "[ cc_and_si ] ) , the scaling of the total cpu time of @xmath2-body simulations is nearly as steep as @xmath51 .",
    "currently , using a state - of - the - art grape-6 board to accelerate the computations @xcite , the evolution of a cluster containing @xmath52 stars with @xmath53 and no primordial binaries can be integrated up to core collapse in about one day ( h.  baumgardt , private communication ) . however , including primordial binaries or increasing the number of stars would still lead to prohibitively long computation times , especially for a parameter study where a large number of integrations are required .",
    "a wide mass spectrum also leads to increased computation times for fp simulations and gaseous models . in these methods ,",
    "a continuous mass spectrum is approximated by discrete mass bins . in the gaseous model ,",
    "the most time - consuming operation of the algorithm is the inversion of large matrix whose dimension is proportional to the number of equations , itself proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "hence the computing time increases like ( r.  spurzem , private communication ) . ]",
    "for fp codes , there is one diffusion term coupling each component to all others , leading to @xmath56 .",
    "these steep scalings limit @xmath54 to at most @xmath57 to avoid computation times longer than a few days .",
    "even with a small number of mass bins , fp simulations have yielded important qualitative results .",
    "inagaki and collaborators investigated two- and multi - component systems @xcite .",
    "they found that the energy transfer _ within _ the core is an important process for determining the onset of core collapse .",
    "fp simulations by @xcite and @xcite show that a mass function with @xmath58 needs to be discretized into about 15 components or more to obtain an accurate value of the core collapse time .",
    "a coarser discretization leads to an artificially slow evolution . @xcite",
    "successfully tracked the energy transfer between different components and demonstrated the importance of this process .",
    "@xcite used fp simulations to follow the evolution of single- and two - component systems .",
    "he used a unique setting for his two - component clusters , with each component having a different initial spatial distribution .",
    "his aim was to study the interaction of galactic nucleus containing mainly dark ( compact ) objects with the bulge of the galaxy . in one model he considered a structure with `` inverse initial mass segregation , '' where the central nucleus is made of objects much lighter than the normal stars composing the bulge .",
    "he showed that this situation also leads to highly accelerated evolution as the more massive stars get trapped by the nucleus through dynamical friction and undergo rapid core collapse .",
    "@xcite also investigated the evolution of clusters with a mass spectrum using fp simulations .",
    "his simulations were two - dimensional ( in phase space ) and therefore he was able to study the development of velocity anisotropy .",
    "gaseous models have the advantage of being very fast ( for @xmath59 ) but they include the greatest number of simplifying assumptions and so require independent checking . the good agreement shown with our mc simulation for a plummer model with salpeter imf in figure  [ fig_cc_compare ] is encouraging .",
    "note , however , that the gaseous model calculation shown in figure  [ fig_cc_compare ] used 50 mass components .",
    "this number of components is exceptionally high , leading to a total computation time in excess of three weeks , much longer than most mc runs .",
    "it was chosen to be able to follow core collapse to a very advanced stage , until the most massive component dominates the collapsing core .",
    "we note that the evolution of the gaseous model to core collapse is faster by some 30% and exhibits a more gradual contraction of the inner region",
    ". the reasons for these small discrepancies will be investigated in future work , where additional comparisons between monte carlo and gaseous model calculations will also be presented @xcite . for the time being , suffice it to mention that for multi - mass clusters , there are basically two adjustable ( dimensionless ) parameters in the gaseous model , one setting the effective thermal conductivity and the other the timescale for energy exchange between components ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 , see @xcite ) . for the model plotted in figure  [ fig_cc_compare ] , we used the standard values of these parameters ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) which were established for clusters with a different structure and mass spectrum and some adjustment ( preferentially through comparisons with @xmath2-body runs ) may be required .",
    "a direct comparison between fp and gaseous models was also carried out by @xcite , for two - component clusters , and also resulted in good agreement .",
    "recently , a hybrid code has been developed by @xcite , combining a gaseous model with mc techniques . in this approach",
    "the single stars are represented by the gaseous model , while primordial binaries are followed with a monte carlo treatment .",
    "a similar hybrid treatment could be applied to the problem we are studying here , but with massive ( single and binary ) stars included in the monte carlo component , and lower - mass stars represented by a gaseous model .",
    "the solution of the fokker - planck equation with an orbit - averaged monte carlo method is an ideal compromise for the problem at hand .",
    "it can handle a suitably large number of stars and a wide mass spectrum can be implemented with very little additional difficulty .",
    "most importantly , as in direct @xmath2-body integrations , mc simulations can implement a star - by - star description of the cluster .",
    "this allows the inclusion of many important processes such as collisions , binary interactions ( including primordial binaries ) , stellar evolution ( and the accompanying mass loss ) , as well as the effects of a massive central object with relative ease and much higher realism compared to direct fp simulations or gaseous models .",
    "we will incorporate the effects of all these additional processes on cluster evolution in the subsequent papers of this series .",
    "the mc code we have used to obtain the main results of this paper is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "it is based on the ideas of @xcite and in many respects it is very similar to mc codes developed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in the rest of this section , we give a brief summary of the numerical method .",
    "the main simplifying assumption is the fokker - planck approximation , in which relaxation processes are assumed to be dominated by small distant encounters rather than strong encounters with large deflections @xcite .",
    "the dynamical evolution can then be treated as a diffusion process in phase space . following the individual interactions between the stars , as in direct @xmath2-body simulations , is computationally expensive .",
    "however , the _ average _ cumulative effect on a star in a given amount of time can be characterized by diffusion coefficients in phase space . to compute the relaxation , the timestep for the numerical evolution has to be chosen smaller than the relaxation time . since the relaxation time is normally shortest at the center",
    ", we choose our timestep to be a fraction of the central relaxation time .",
    "this ensures that the relaxation is followed accurately throughout the cluster .",
    "another important simplification in the mc method is the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "the position of the particles is represented by a single radial coordinate , @xmath64 , and the velocity is represented by radial , @xmath65 , and tangential , @xmath66 , components .",
    "the specific angular momentum , @xmath67 , and the specific energy , @xmath68 , of a star with index @xmath69 , are given by : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the gravitational potential at a given point .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry implies that the potential at all points can be computed in a time proportional to the number of particles @xmath2 , rather than @xmath48 .    in hnon",
    "s algorithm , the evolution is simulated by reproducing the effect of the cluster on each star by a single effective encounter in each timestep . at every iteration",
    "the two integrals of the motion @xmath72 and @xmath73 characterizing the orbit of each star are perturbed in a way that is consistent with the value of the diffusion coefficients @xcite . to conserve energy ,",
    "this perturbation is realized by a single effective scattering between two neighboring stars .",
    "the square of the scattering angle , @xmath74 , is proportional to the timestep chosen .",
    "we choose our timestep such that @xmath75 at the center of the cluster .",
    "choosing too large a timestep will lead to a saturation effect and the relaxation will proceed artificially slowly . using too small a timestep , on the other hand , not only increases the computation time , but also can lead to spurious relaxation ( see the appendix for a discussion of spurious relaxation effects ) .",
    "after the perturbation of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the stars are placed at random positions between their apocenters and pericenters using a probability distribution that is proportional to the time spent at a given location on their new orbit . for a star with index @xmath69 , the apocenter and pericenter distances are calculated by finding the roots of @xmath76 this random placement is justified by the assumption of dynamical equilibrium , i.e. , the evolution of the system does not take place on the crossing ( or dynamical ) timescale , but rather on the relaxation timescale .",
    "the only important point about assigning a specific position to a particle on its orbit is that its contribution to density , potential , interaction rates , etc . , has to be estimated correctly .",
    "after all stars have been placed at their new positions , the potential is recalculated and the whole cycle of perturbation is repeated .",
    "this method can be modified so that the timestep is a fraction of the _ local _ relaxation time @xcite . @xcite and @xcite divided the system into zones resulting in an approach intermediate between a fixed and smoothly varying timestep . dividing the system into radial zones also allows the mc method to be parallelized efficiently for use on multi - processor machines @xcite .",
    "another possible modification uses a scaling of the units such that each particle in the simulation can represent an entire spherical shell of many identical stars rather than a single star @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that , although the effects of strong encounters between stars on relaxation are assumed to be negligible compared to weak , more distant encounters , they can be incorporated by estimating their rate of occurrence in a way similar to physical collisions @xcite or interactions with binary stars @xcite .    our mc code has been used previously to study many fundamental dynamical processes such as the spitzer instability @xcite and mass segregation @xcite for simple two - component systems , as well as the evolution of systems with a continuous but fairly narrow mass spectrum of evolving stars @xcite .",
    "a difficulty introduced by a broad continuous imf ( with a large @xmath77 ratio ) is the necessity of adjusting the timestep to treat correctly encounters between stars of very different masses .",

    "first , we take arithmetic averages over 60 points and reduce the total number of points to @xmath179 . then for each point and using the closest 6 points we fit a cubic polynomial using least squares and we evaluate this polynomial at the corresponding time .",
    "this way we both smooth the lagrange radii further and estimate their derivatives . when the system is going into core collapse , a decrease in the collapse rate is an indication that the results provided by our code are beginning to be dominated by numerical errors .",
    "we stop the simulation when this happens and define the core collapse time as the last point before this behavior is observed .",
    "we then find the innermost lagrange radius that has a positive derivative at the time of core collapse and estimate the mass of the stars that participate in core collapse as the mass enclosed by this radius .",
    "an investigation of figure  [ fig_model2_zoom ] by eye verifies that this method produces reasonable results . in practice , we track many more lagrange radii than shown in this figure , at intervals of 0.02% between 0.08% and 0.36% .    because of small - number fluctuations ( and , in particular , the intrinsic noise in the innermost lagrange radii ) there is a statistical uncertainty in all the numbers quoted in table  [ table_models ] .",
    "this uncertainty is not unphysical , as real systems will be affected similarly by fluctuations in the number and specific properties of a relatively small number of massive stars . to test the robustness of our results and",
    "estimate this uncertainty we have repeated 1020 simulations with different random seeds for model  2 and some of its variants with different numbers of stars ( models  2r , 2s , and  2b ) .",
    "for these models the numbers in table  [ table_models ] are obtained by averaging the results of the various ( physically equivalent ) runs .",
    "the standard deviations obtained for the values of @xmath180 and @xmath181 for our typical model  2 are about 5% and 20% , respectively .",
    "the larger uncertainty in @xmath181 is a result of the high sensitivity of this quantity to noise in the innermost lagrange radii .",
    "we can not study the evolution of the cluster past core collapse without treating in detail the dynamics of the central stars during collapse , which is beyond the scope of this paper . in future work",
    "we will include a detailed treatment of stellar collisions in the core ( paperii , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , one could use a hybrid method and treat the central part of the cluster with a direct @xmath2-body approach @xcite .",
    "however , the simplest approximation may be to introduce an effective boundary condition at some very small radius .",
    "@xcite , in his model b2 , took this approach , but his implementation was not conserving energy .",
    "the sharp onset of core collapse for our reference model , shown in figure  [ fig_model2 ] , is a result of the spitzer instability .",
    "this instability is driven by the segregation of the heaviest stars toward the center and their dynamical decoupling from the rest of the system . as indicated by the results of section  [ sec_ms_cc ] ,",
    "the ratio of maximum to average stellar mass in the imf , @xmath182 , is an important parameter setting the timescale for the onset of instability .",
    "there are various ways to study the dependence of our results on this parameter .",
    "one can use an imf different from salpeter , e.g. , miller - scalo or kroupa .",
    "in addition , when using a power - law imf , changing the slope @xmath183 or the maximum mass @xmath94 will obviously alter the value of the ratio @xmath184 .",
    "our results from simulations for a large number of models exploring these various alternative imf are presented in figure  [ fig_imf_comp ] .",
    "note that for @xmath185 our results suggest a relation @xmath186 , also obeyed by all fokker - planck models from @xcite and @xcite with @xmath187 and a number of mass components sufficient to ensure proper sampling of the imf .",
    "however our computations extend to much higher values of @xmath188 than those works . beyond @xmath189 , a domain reached by any realistic imf",
    ", the core collapse time approaches a constant @xmath190 .",
    "therefore our main conclusions appear to be _ independent of the details of the imf _ as long as the number of massive stars in the system is large enough .    for small values of @xmath184 , not only the timescale but also the very nature of the collapse changes .",
    "in these systems the evolution timescale , i.e. , the relaxation time , of the subsystem that can decouple from the rest of the cluster is no longer small enough that the evolution of lighter stars can be neglected .",
    "the lagrange radii for these models behave similarly to the single - component case , i.e. , there is no clear separation between collapsing and expanding lagrange radii .",
    "consequently , we do not give values of @xmath181 for these models in table  [ table_models ] .",
    "@xcite , using fp simulations , also found that , for a clear decoupling , the relaxation time of the subsystem has to be short compared to that of the other stars .",
    "one expects the core collapse time to depend strongly on the initial density profile of the cluster , and , in particular , on the central concentration .",
    "a simple and systematic way to examine this dependence is to use different king models with varying concentration parameter or @xmath84 ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 - 10 ) . for single - component clusters",
    "this has been done using a variety of methods @xcite .",
    "we have carried out a number of simulations using king models with @xmath191 as initial structure .",
    "our simulations include both isolated clusters ( with no tidal boundary enforced , even though the initial models are truncated ) and clusters with a tidal boundary ( assuming a circular orbit in a spherical galactic potential ) .",
    "this tidal boundary is initially chosen to be at the tidal radius of the king model and then adjusted as the cluster loses mass @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig_tcc_trh]a we plot the ratio of core collapse time to initial half - mass relaxation time for our simulations , along with results for single - component clusters .",
    "the ratio @xmath180 is much smaller for systems with mass spectrum , as would be expected .",
    "we also see that the core collapse time for these systems is independent of the presence of a tidal boundary , as expected when core collapse is driven by local processes within the core rather than by global energy transfer .",
    "this idea is strongly supported by the results in figure  [ fig_tcc_trh]b , which shows the comparison of the ratio of core collapse time to _ central _ relaxation time , for our simulations and single - component models . with respect to single - component models ,",
    "the ratio @xmath192 for systems with a broad mass spectrum shows very little variation .",
    "we have also run two simulations for @xmath79-models , using @xmath87 ( hernquist model ) , and @xmath154 .",
    "initially , models with @xmath193 have vanishing central velocity dispersion and , for @xmath194 , they exhibit a central `` temperature inversion '' @xcite",
    ". for single - component clusters , the central region at first undergoes rapid gravothermal expansion until it becomes isothermal and `` normal '' core collapse can start @xcite",
    ". models with @xmath194 also have zero initial central relaxation time have _ infinite _",
    "@xmath132 because their velocity dispersion rises like @xmath195 near the center @xcite . ] .",
    "our results for king models would then suggest that core collapse induced by central mass segregation should be extremely fast , if it were not for the opposite effect of the temperature inversion . for @xmath196 , mass segregation seems to have the upper hand in the competition and it proves impossible to resolve core collapse because extreme mass segregation appears nearly instantaneously during the mc runs . models with @xmath152 and @xmath154 expand at first and then evolve to core collapse very rapidly .",
    "the core collapse time and collapsing core mass are very hard to determine numerically for these models . in table",
    "[ table_models ] , we give only an upper limit on their core collapse times .",
    "obviously , these values are so short that their physical relevance is unclear .",
    "it is hard to imagine through which process such a cluster could be created if one wants it to be virialized but without initial mass segregation because these conditions impose constraints on the formation timescale unlikely to be satisfied in real systems . in addition , note that the local dynamical time in a @xmath152 model approaches a constant non - zero value near the center , while , formally , the relaxation time goes to zero there .",
    "this suggests that such models can only provide an approximate description of real clusters , where finite - number effects will play a key role near the center , so that the question of determining the evolution in the limit of very large @xmath2 is not well posed .",
    "naturally we expect that any initial mass segregation in a cluster should lead to an even shorter core collapse time as the heavier stars are starting their life closer to the center on average , and therefore do not need as much time to concentrate there through mass segregation .    our results from mc simulations with initial mass segregation ( sec .",
    "3.3 ) are presented in table  [ table_ims ] and figure  [ fig_ims ] .",
    "as expected , we find that @xmath180 decreases with increasing @xmath114 ( i.e. , when stars become more and more massive on average in the inner region ) , and with increasing @xmath116 ( i.e. , when the increase in average stellar mass takes place over a larger central region ) .",
    "however , the values of @xmath181 do not appear to be affected significantly ( within expected random fluctuations from run to run ) .",
    "the implication for bh formation through runaway collisions is that the final bh mass may not be affected by initial mass segregation , while the condition for runaway growth to occur ( see sec .  5 )",
    "will be relaxed as the core collapse takes place even earlier .",
    "the simulations described so far consider only the dynamical evolution of the cluster , neglecting the stellar evolution entirely . we have also carried out a number of simulations to understand how stellar evolution and the accompanying mass loss can modify the dynamical evolution .",
    "the stellar evolution treatment we have adopted is that of @xcite , based on the approximations of @xcite .",
    "stellar evolution introduces a new physical clock in the system , independent of relaxation .",
    "therefore it is necessary to specify the physical scale of an initial cluster model ( e.g. , the half - mass radius in pc ) before starting a simulation so that the relaxation time @xmath17 can be calculated in years and related to the stellar evolution timescale .",
    "the only other parameter to be specified is the metallicity @xmath197 , which plays an important role in the calculation of stellar evolution mass loss . in our treatment of stellar evolution ,",
    "all wind mass loss rates are proportional to @xmath198 . since stellar evolution introduces two new parameters in our initial models ,",
    "a full exploration of the initial parameter space is clearly impossible .",
    "fortunately , we will see that the effects of mass loss on the evolution to core collapse are rather unimportant , and so a systematic study is unnecessary at this point .",
    "we first illustrate how _ post - main - sequence _ evolution of massive stars can prevent core collapse . in figure  [ fig_mass_loss ]",
    "we show the evolution of a system similar to model  2 with @xmath199 and @xmath200 . at such low metallicity",
    ", there is little mass loss on the main sequence , so one expects @xmath201 without evolution beyond the main sequence . however , massive stars evolve off the main sequence after about @xmath202myr , before core collapse has occurred .",
    "once they evolve off the main sequence , they typically lose up to @xmath203 of their mass rapidly . at the end of their life , which extends about 10% beyond their main - sequence lifetime ,",
    "these stars undergo supernova explosions and their cores collapse to bh . in the upper panel of figure  [ fig_mass_loss ]",
    "we plot the number of these bh in the cluster .",
    "the significant mass loss during the late stages of stellar evolution causes the cluster core to expand so that collapse is prevented and the system then goes into long - term dynamical evolution .",
    "varying @xmath197 from @xmath204 to 0.02 ( the solar value ) , we found that this reversal of core contraction occurs for any metallicity when massive stars are allowed to evolve off the main sequence .",
    "higher metallicities of course lead to increased mass loss and an even stronger tendency for the cluster core to expand .",
    "we have not considered the case of @xmath205 , i.e. , a cluster of pop  iii stars .",
    "these stars may collapse to bh that incorporate essentially the entire initial stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the cluster would then be unaffected by mass loss .",
    "whenever a runaway is avoided , a dense cluster of relatively massive primordial bh would then form near the center .",
    "this is an intriguing possibility to keep in mind for future consideration , although the imf of pop  iii stars is essentially unknown ( but see , e.g. , @xcite ) and recent hydrodynamic simulations suggest that the first stars may actually form isolated rather than in clusters @xcite .",
    "we have also examined the possibility that mass loss _ on the main sequence _ may already be a source of indirect heating strong enough to reverse core collapse or , at least , delay it significantly .",
    "our results indicate that wind mass loss from main - sequence stars alone can never prevent core collapse and that the delay introduced remains very small , even for high metallicities .",
    "it is of course always possible to fine - tune the relaxation time so that the mass loss slows down the evolution just enough to allow a few massive stars to evolve off the main sequence and stop contraction .",
    "but such models can only represent a very small domain in the parameter space of initial conditions .",
    "for example , in a system like model  2 with @xmath206 , the core collapse time increases only by about 5% for @xmath207 . for @xmath208 , the evolution",
    "is just delayed long enough to prevent core collapse for @xmath207 , but not for @xmath209 .",
    "one has to increase the relaxation time to @xmath199 for stellar evolution to prevent core collapse for all metallicities .    in conclusion",
    ", we find that post - main - sequence mass loss can be strong enough to prevent early core collapse , but that it does not significantly tighten the condition ( on @xmath17 ) for core collapse to occur .",
    "mass loss from main - sequence stars always plays a negligible role .",
    "it has long been realized that a mass spectrum accelerates the dynamical evolution of dense star clusters through the process of mass segregation @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the statistical tendency of two - body gravitational encounters to establish energy equipartition between stars of different masses . for any realistic imf",
    ", equipartition can never be achieved because the massive stars quickly form a separate self - gravitating subcluster ( a system with negative effective heat capacity ) as they segregate near the center by transferring kinetic energy to lighter stars @xcite .",
    "this instability leads to a rapid core collapse : after a finite time @xmath162 , the central density of stars would actually become infinite in the absence of finite size effects ( both physical collisions between stars and the finite number of stars in the core ) .    with the exception of a few recent @xmath2-body simulations @xcite , all previous investigations of core collapse in clusters with a mass spectrum",
    "have considered a relatively narrow range of stellar masses ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "this restriction is appropriate for old globular clusters in which stellar evolution probably had time to remove all massive stars before significant relaxation took place .",
    "in contrast , in the present study , we ignored stellar evolution to concentrate on systems in which , by assumption , core collapse occurs before even the most massive stars ( with @xmath211 ) leave the ms .    through a set of high - resolution monte carlo simulations of clusters with a variety of imf and structural parameters ( concentration , presence or absence of tidal truncation or initial mass segregation ) , we established two important results .",
    "the first concerns the time needed to go deep into core collapse ( @xmath162 ) . as the evolution to core collapse",
    "is driven by relaxation processes , @xmath162 can always be written as proportional to the initial half - mass or central relaxation time ( @xmath17 , @xmath132 ) .",
    "the proportionality constant does not depend on the size of the cluster or the number of stars , as long as they are numerous enough to avoid small - number effects . for isolated clusters with an imf of realistic slope ( @xmath212 in the high - mass range ) ,",
    "we find @xmath213 as @xmath214 increases from 1 ( single - mass ) to @xmath215 .",
    "this result extends and agrees nicely with previous work based on fp simulations @xcite . from simple arguments about dynamical friction",
    ", one would naively expect a linear relation with @xmath216 @xcite .",
    "the steeper dependence found in our numerical results may be related to the fact that the instability causing the core collapse is triggered only after some critical number , @xmath217 , of sufficiently massive stars have drifted to the core by dynamical friction .",
    "if one has to go out to radius @xmath218 to find this number of heavy stars , the required timescale will be of order @xmath219 .",
    "for systems with increasing @xmath214 , it is reasonable to expect @xmath217 and , consequently , @xmath218 and @xmath220 to decrease . while this provides a plausible explanation , further investigations will be needed to confirm it , in particular studies making use of the gaseous model of cluster dynamics @xcite .    for @xmath221 ,",
    "the core collapse time saturates to @xmath222 a key result given that any realistic imf is likely to have @xmath223 .",
    "this value of @xmath162 is at least two orders of magnitude shorter than the core collapse time for single - component clusters .",
    "moreover , we find this @xmath192 ratio to hold for all the models we have considered that have a finite @xmath132 .",
    "this includes king models ( with or without tidal truncation ) with @xmath84 ranging from 1 to 9 , a sequence along which @xmath180 decreases by more than @xmath224 .",
    "our result that the core collapse time is set fundamentally by @xmath132 rather than @xmath17 reflects an important difference between single - component clusters and systems with a broad mass spectrum : in systems with a mass spectrum , core collapse is driven ultimately by energy transfer occurring _ locally _ in the core ; in contrast , relaxation in a single - component system is a _ global _",
    "process taking place on all scales , resulting in a timescale comparable to @xmath225 @xcite . for plummer models or king models with moderate concentration ( @xmath226 ) ,",
    "we find @xmath227 , in good agreement with the results of @xmath2-body simulations by @xcite and @xmath132 , @xmath225 is , by far , easier to estimate observationally . ] .",
    "the main - sequence lifetime @xmath228 of very massive stars approaches a constant value , of about @xmath229myr , with only weak dependence on metallicity , rotation , or the mass @xmath169 of the star , as long as @xmath230 @xcite .",
    "it exhibits little variation with @xmath169 because such massive stars are nearly eddington - limited , hence @xmath231 , where @xmath232 is the luminosity , and @xmath233constant if the fractional mass of the convective core , @xmath234 , does not depend too strongly on the stellar mass is compared to the `` usual '' relation @xmath235 , one could conclude erroneously that massive stars never play an important role in core collapse @xcite .",
    "however , the approximate @xmath236 scaling of the stellar lifetime applies only for @xmath237 . ] .",
    "therefore , the necessary condition for core collapse not being stopped by stellar evolution can be written @xmath238 interestingly , we also find that core collapse can not be prevented by mass loss through stellar winds on the ms",
    ". such mass loss can only delay the evolution to core collapse very slightly . even for",
    "high metallicities and hence strong winds , only clusters for which the core collapse time would otherwise be very close to the critical value ( i.e. , just below @xmath228 ) can see their fate changed through wind mass loss if @xmath162 increases to become slightly longer than @xmath228 .",
    "these clusters must represent a very small domain in the parameter space of initial conditions .",
    "our second important finding is that , as the collapse proceeds , the mass contained in the ever - shrinking core converges to a non - zero value , @xmath239 which depends only weakly on the properties of the initial cluster .",
    "this contrasts again with single - component clusters which , exhibiting self - similar collapse , have @xmath240 as @xmath241 .",
    "this value of @xmath181 is in remarkable agreement with the fractional mass of a dark object , presumably a massive bh , discovered at the center of galaxies ( in which case , @xmath242 stands for the mass in the spheroidal component ) and , possibly , globular clusters like m15 and g1 .",
    "this suggests that the collapsing core may well be the progenitor of a central imbh .",
    "however , for a galactic nucleus , the requirement that @xmath243myr would imply that , either it evolved from a cluster with short ( central ) relaxation time to its present - day state with @xmath244yr @xcite , or that the growth of the central bh was predominantly from accretion of smaller star clusters with short relaxation times ( each one carrying an imbh at its center ; @xcite ) .",

    "( for m15 , an _ initial _ value of @xmath247 seems required ; see fig .",

    "the arches cluster near the center of our galaxy is the best established example , with @xmath248 probably shorter than 10myr @xcite , while the quintuplet cluster appears to lie very close to the critical value @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that some super star clusters , the birthplaces of most stars in starburst environments , have sufficiently short relaxation times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although the final fate of the stars that participate in core collapse is not completely certain , very high rates of physical collisions are expected in the core .",
    "primordial binaries are probably unable to stop the collapse and prevent these collisions . in smaller systems like globular clusters interactions with hard binaries",
    "may in fact increase the collision rate . in more extreme environments like ( proto-)galactic nuclei ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is so high ( @xmath249 ) that most primordial binaries are soft and will have been disrupted before they can play a role in the collapse .",
    "the main uncertainty is then whether these collisions , occurring at relatively high velocity , allow a massive star to gain mass in a runaway fashion , as suggested by analytical models ( based on the dependence of the cross section on the mass and neglecting collisional mass - loss ; ( * ? ? ?",

    "however , in a system containing a broad imf , a relatively small number of very massive stars could introduce significant discrete changes in the slope of the potential . as the positions of these steps change randomly from one iteration to the next",

    "we plot various relevant quantities showing the evolution of the system in figure  [ fig_spur_relax ] .",

    "in particular , @xmath265 is a free parameter in both approaches .",
    "what this result demonstrates is that these assumptions are correctly implemented in our mc code ."
