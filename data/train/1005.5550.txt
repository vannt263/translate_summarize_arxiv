    "solar matter impacting the atmosphere is ejected from the sun primarily as a result of solar flares , solar wind , coronal mass ejections , and solar prominences .",
    "solar flares are sporadic events and are caused by the magnetic instabilities and disturbances in the corona that happen when energy stored in twisted magnetic fields is suddenly released .",
    "the other source of electrons and protons is the low - energy solar wind which results from the high temperature of the corona .",
    "the solar wind carries an electron - proton plasma , constantly evaporated by the sun and which is hot enough to escape the sun s gravity and to flow outward into space , continuously shedding electrons and protons .",
    "coronal mass ejection from the sun consists of plasma comprised primarily of electrons and protons as well as small quantities of nuclei such as helium , oxygen , and iron .",
    "solar prominences are loops of radiant gas ejected from an active region on the solar surface that move through the inner parts of the corona under the influence of the sun s magnetic field .",
    "the ionized gas generated by these phenomena follows the solar magnetic field lines away from the sun .",
    "most of it subsequently cools and falls back to the photosphere .",
    "therefore , besides the electromagnetic radiation , the basic corpuscular parts of the solar radiation heading towards the earth that subsequently interact with the atmosphere are electrons and protons in the energy spectrum between a few tenth of ev to hundreds of mev @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they are deflected by the earth s magnetic field towards the poles and get scattered and absorbed by atmospheric atoms and molecules .",
    "the accompanying ionization of various gases in the upper atmosphere is causing beautiful displays known as the aurora - a luminous glow of the upper atmosphere .    while there have been investigations of main characteristics of the aurora and their dependence on factors such as altitude , geographic placement , solar activity etc .",
    ", there is still a lack of the quantitative description of this phenomenon . upon reaching the denser layers of the atmosphere ,",
    "electrons and protons participate in various inelastic processes such as ionization , molecular excitation , and charge - exchange reactions on atmospheric gases , especially on nitrogen molecules .",
    "spectral analysis of the aurora shows that the ionized nitrogen molecules can radiate in the visible , infrared and ultraviolet region .",
    "usually , the appearance of this radiation is observed at an altitude of approximately 110 km .",
    "observations of the prominent first negative ( @xmath12 ) and meinel ( @xmath13 ) band system in the ionized nitrogen molecule @xmath14 indicate their presence in the aurora and the dayglow @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 system of the @xmath14 has been extensively studied since meinel @xcite first observed the existence of the @xmath16 excited state in auroral emissions in the near - infrared and the @xmath15 system of the @xmath17 became known as the meinel system .    because @xmath18the @xmath16 state of the @xmath14 ion is effectively created during the ionization of the @xmath19 molecule by electron impact or capture of an electron by a proton ( hydrogen emissions are the signature of proton aurora ) , the spectrum of the aurora is characterized by the bright lighting of the meinel band .",
    "these bands appear in the spectra of polar auroras and carry information on the collision processes which take place between molecules and electrons in the upper atmosphere . during @xmath20 and @xmath21 collisions ,",
    "a vibrationally excited n@xmath22 molecules and their radiative decay are accompanied by creation of ground electronic x@xmath23 states . hence , in the aurora the relative vibrational population of the x@xmath4 state is partly governed by electron excitation and relaxation processes of the a@xmath8 states .",
    "the study of the emission spectra gives the opportunity to determine the concentration and energy distribution of particles entering the upper layer of the atmosphere . to solve this problem",
    ", it is necessary to determine the absolute cross sections of various inelastic processes , such as ionization , excitation , and charge - exchange with high precision .",
    "determination of the absolute cross section of the meinel band system is especially problematic .",
    "number of experimental works in which the meinel band system is measured is very limited , and they are usually related to the processes of excitation of the meinel band through electron collisions with nitrogen molecules @xcite - @xcite . in addition , in the case of electron impact , the experimentally determined cross section for a formation of the n@xmath22 ions in the a - state is also known within 50% because measurements of the excitation cross section are connected with various difficulties . in particular , the lifetime of the nitrogen molecule ions in the a@xmath8 state is about @xmath24 s @xcite , and during measurements the quenching of excited particles ( the transfer of the excited energy to other particles ) is expected to occur .",
    "there is only one study @xcite of the excitation of the meinel band @xmath25 by a proton impact on the n@xmath1 molecule in the energy range @xmath26 kev .    in this article",
    ", we present the results of measurements for the electron and proton impact excitation of the n@xmath22 first negative ( 1ng ) and meinel band system obtained with a high precision .",
    "the measurements are performed in the visible ( @xmath27 nm ) spectral region using the optical spectroscopy method for electron energies 400 -1500 ev and proton energies 0.4 - 10 kev .",
    "a relative population of vibrational states corresponding to the meinel band is measured at a sufficiently low pressure ( @xmath28 mtorr ) .",
    "therefore , the quenching and excitation effects caused by collisions involving secondary electrons are minimized .",
    "we have measured the absolute value of the cross sections for the first negative nitrogen molecule ion ( b@xmath29 - x@xmath4 ) with band @xmath7 and for the meinel system ( a@xmath8x@xmath4 ) with bands @xmath10 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the discrepancies in absolute cross sections and theoretical interpretations are discussed .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii the research method is described . in sec .",
    "iii the experimental results and their discussion are presented .",
    "finally , conclusions follow in sec .",
    "we have used an experimental setup and method of measurements similar to those described and used in our previous papers @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the protons extracted from the high frequency discharge source were accelerated , collimated and focused , and mass - selected with a @xmath30 magnetic sector field . then the proton beam was directed into the collision chamber . in order to make the measurements for the case of electron collisions we used the electron gun placed into the mass - analyser chamber .",
    "the electron beam was deflected at @xmath31 and , after the collimation and additional focusing , was directed into the collision chamber .",
    "the fluorescence emitted as a result of the excitation of colliding particles was observed at 90@xmath32 with respect to the beam . in the present work , measurements are performed by the optical spectroscopy method that allowed us to have the sufficiently high energy resolution of @xmath33  ev and therefore sufficient to distinguish the excitation channels .",
    "this is one of the advantages of this method , with respect to the collisional spectroscopy method . _",
    "_  _ _ this method also allowed us to estimate the polarization of excitation , that itself is a powerful tool for establishing the mechanism for inelastic processes .",
    "the spectroscopic analysis of the emission was performed with a monochromator incorporating a diffraction grating with a resolution of 40 nm / mm operated in the visible ( @xmath34 nm ) spectral region .",
    "a polarizer and a mica quarter - wave phase plate are placed in front of the entrance slit of the monochromator and the linear polarization of the emission is analyzed . for cancellation of the polarizing effect of the monochromator , the phase plate was placed after the polarizer and was rigidly coupled to it .",
    "the emission was recorded by a photomultiplier with a cooled cathode and operated in the current mode .",
    "calibration of the spectral sensitivity was performed by a tungsten filament standard lamp , which was chosen due to the lack of reliable experimental data in the infrared region ( the bright meinel system ) , that could be used for the calibration of the system for registration of radiation . _ _  _ _ to obtain the proton beam we use a high frequency ( 20 mhz ) ion source .",
    "the measurements for low energy collisions required a precise determination of energy of ions or electrons as well as their energy dispersion . to avoid errors in the measurements of energy of the incident protons and electrons , we employed the retarding potential method and used the electrostatic analyzer with a resolution of 500 .",
    "thus , the energy resolution of the electron beam was the same that for protons , i.e. 500 .",
    "the energy of the proton and electron beams was calibrated by measuring their energy . *  * to estimate the dispersion of energy provided by the high frequency ion source and electron gun we measured the energy of impacting particles .",
    "the results of the measurements for protons accelerated by the potential of 600 v are given in fig .",
    "the measurements show that the energy deviation from 600 ev is approximately 35 ev .",
    "this is related  to the specification of the high frequency ion source and the selection of ions from plasma . from fig . 1",
    ", we can see that maximum is observed at 566 ev with a half - width about 20 ev . in our experiments",
    "the energy dispersion of the protons does not exceed this value . for electrons",
    "the energy dispersion is less then 5 ev .",
    "the proton current in the collision chamber was of the order @xmath35 @xmath36a while the electron current was @xmath37 @xmath36a .",
    "the system was pumped by an oil - diffusion pump .",
    "the operating pressure of the gas under investigation did not exceed @xmath38 torr , so that multiple collisions could be ignored .",
    "the residual - gas pressure did not exceed  @xmath39 torr .",
    "the absolute accuracy of the measurements was 30% .",
    "the accuracy of measurements is related to the following factors : the accuracy of pressure measurements in the collision chamber ; precise and immediate determination of the primary beam current that produce the radiation that collected by optical system from the region where the collision occurs ; accuracies of the relative and absolute calibration procedures .    _",
    "_  _ _ the precision of  measurements  of  the meinel  band  systemstrongly  depend  on  two  factors  -  quenching  of  the excited  n@xmath40  molecule  in  the a@xmath8  state  and  overlapping  ofmeinel  bands  with  the other  molecular  emission  @xcite , malxaz 8 .",
    "most  of  the  meinel  bands  are  spectrally  overlappedwith  nitrogen  first  positive  emissions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the  degree  of  overlapping  depends  on  pressureand  the  meinel  bands  are  less  overlapped  at  low  pressures  wherethe  excitation  of  the  meinel  bands  is  stronger  relative  to  theexcitation  of  the  first  positive  bands .  at  higher  pressures  themeinel  bands  are  quenched  more  efficiently .",
    "also ,  the  flux  ofsecondary  electrons  increases  with  pressure  and  the  secondaryelectrons  excite  the  first  positive  bands  more  efficiently  thanthe  primary  electrons  do @xcite .    to explore an electron excitation quenching effects , we investigated the spectrum of the meinel band system in processes of the excitation of the nitrogen molecule by the electron impact .",
    "the experiment was performed with various densities of the nitrogen target particles . to control excitation quenching effect , the ratio of the excitation cross section of the meinel band and the excitation cross section of the first negative band system ( @xmath41 ) of a nitrogen molecular ion have been measured in various experimental conditions by varying the concentration of target particles . at the lowest pressures ( less than about 1 mtorr ) , when the number of created secondary electrons was small the degree of the first positive band excitation relative to the meinel band excitation was at most only a few percent @xcite .",
    "the single collision condition was checked by a linear dependence of the intensity of spectral lines versus target gas pressure and density of the electron current .",
    "measurements are performed in the visible ( @xmath34 nm ) excitation region . to demonstrate a reliability of the emission spectrum measurements , as an example in fig .",
    "2 , the spectral scan is shown from 700 @xmath6715 nm in the first order of the diffraction grating for the n@xmath22 @xmath42 @xmath9 band  for the electron - n@xmath1 collision at 400 ev .",
    "it is clear that there is no influence due to the collision quenching effect , because the lifetime of the zero vibrational level of the @xmath43 state is about three orders of magnitude less than the lifetime of the vibrational level of@xmath44 states .",
    "the optimal experimental conditions were established based on these considerations .    to obtain the absolute value of the cross section , we use the cross section @xmath45 @xmath46 of the first negative system @xmath7 for a proton - n@xmath1 collision at the energy @xmath47 kev from ref .",
    "@xcite as reference . in ref",
    "@xcite the analysis of all experimental data of the exitation state for ( 391.4 nm ) ( 0 , 0 ) band spectrum in a wide energy interval is performed .",
    "their analysis shows that the data obtained at a high energy interval are more reliable ( discrepancy in data at energy of protons @xmath48 kev is about @xmath4915% ) .",
    "_ _  _ _ it should be mentioned that during the experiment it was possible to measure the band spectrum for protons and electrons in the same experimental conditions .",
    "this provides an opportunity to obtain the absolute cross section for the electron collision based on the proton data .  for the same experimental conditions ,",
    "the radiation band for the first negative system @xmath7 was measured for the proton and electron at energies of 7 kev and of 600 ev respectively .",
    "comparison determined that the cross section for electrons for the 1ng @xmath7 band at the given energy is @xmath50 @xmath51",
    "firstly , let us present the results for the electron impact excitation of the n@xmath22 nitrogen ion for the first negative and meinel bands .",
    "the results of the measurements of the absolute excitation cross sections for the first negative @xmath7 and meinel @xmath10 , @xmath9 and @xmath52 ) band systems by electron impact on n@xmath1 in the energy region of @xmath53 ev are shown in fig .",
    "analysis of the results shows that the above mentioned vibrational population of molecule states n@xmath22 ( a@xmath54 obey the franck - condon principle @xcite . from the comparison of the results of our measurements of the cross section for the 1ng @xmath7 band system with the data from ref .",
    "@xcite shown in fig .",
    "3 , we can conclude that their magnitude as well as energy dependence are in good agreement . note that in ref .",
    "@xcite the detail analysis of all existing data for the excitation of the ( 0,0 ) band of the first negative system by electrons impact was carried out .",
    "it was emphasized that the energy dependence of cross section measured in ref .",
    "@xcite can be used as a representative in the wide energy interval ( 19 - 1000ev ) .",
    "the recommended data from @xcite was obtained by renormalizing the value of cross section from ref .",
    "@xcite to the best values determined in ref .",
    "@xcite at 100 ev . from fig .",
    "3 , it is clearly seen that the ratio of the cross sections of the meinel band system to that of the first negative band system ( @xmath55 nm ) @xmath7 does not depend on the energy of incident particles .",
    "the same behavior has been obtained by piper and coauthors @xcite .",
    "however , the measured excitation cross sections of the meinel band system by the electron impact differ by the factor of two from the existing measurements @xcite and @xcite .      to study the excitation of the meinel band system by proton impact on the nitrogen molecule , with the omission of the quenching effect",
    ", the impulse gained by the target particle in charge - exchange processes is taken into consideration .",
    "for the case in which the collision processes occur at a small impact parameter , a large momentum transfer to the target particle takes place .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the target particles will have large velocity and , due to large lifetime ( @xmath24 s@xmath56 , the excited particles will escape from the observable excitation area without being registered by the detector .",
    "for this reason , we analyze the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the differential cross sections of charge - exchange processes .",
    "the data analysis shows , that the scattering cross section has maximum at very small angles and then at the angle about of 1 degree it reduced by three orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "for this reason for collision of 10 kev protons the measurements were taken within the scattered angle limited to @xmath57  therefore the estimated the maximal value of energy obtained by the target particles is determined as * *  * * @xcite :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the masses of a proton and n@xmath1 molecule , respectively , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the energy and scattering angle of the proton , respectively , and the function @xmath63 reaches the maximum value of 1 for the elastic limit only . according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) the velocity of target particles is @xmath64=10@xmath65 cm / sec .",
    "the particle in the excited a@xmath6states with this velocity can run 1 cm distance . in order to register all of the radiation",
    "it is necessary that the height of the entrance slit of the monochromator would be more than 1 cm and an observed object in the collision area should be away from the entrance slit at a distance , that is sufficiently greater than 1 cm . in this case , the saturation of the excitation along the beam will be kept in advance . during measurements ,",
    "the pressure of the target particles was kept sufficiently low in order to minimize collisional quenching effect .",
    "results obtained for these conditions are shown in fig .",
    "4 , where the total excitation cross sections for  the excitation of the @xmath10 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 bands of the meinel system  by proton impact on n@xmath1 are presented . interestingly enough , the ratio of the cross sections of @xmath9 to @xmath10 bands , and @xmath66 to @xmath10 bands , are 0.8 and 0.55 , respectively . these ratios are practically independent of the proton energy .",
    "the approximate values 0.9 and 0.54 are obtained for these ratios for the case of the electron - n@xmath1 collision .",
    "these results are also in good agreement with previously published data in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",

    "5 . for the given states ,",
    "the total cross sections are determined by summation of the cross sections that correspond to the population of the partial vibrational levels .",
    "the data analysis for the meinel band system shows that the relative population of the separate level is well described by franck - condon principle .",
    "thus , for determination of the excitation cross section of electronic states , it is sufficient to measure the excitation function for some intense excitation band .",
    "the behavior of the excitation function for the 1ng n@xmath22 @xmath69b@xmath70 ground state and the excitation of vibrational levels are different and essentially depend on the energy interval . to determine the excitation cross sections for the 1ng n@xmath22 @xmath69b@xmath68 state the cross sections for the ( @xmath71 ) , ( @xmath72 ) and ( @xmath73 ) excitation bands were measured . using the decay probabilities of the vibrational states from ref .",
    "@xcite , the excitation cross sections of the states 0 , 1 and 2 were determined . using the expression    @xmath74    we determine the total cross section of the excitation state of n@xmath22(b@xmath75)@xmath76 the total cross section obtained in this way is quite accurate because the contributions of the excited vibrational states with @xmath77 are small .    to describe collision processes",
    ", we use the quasidiatomic approximation , i.e. , the molecule is considered as one centered atomic particle .",

    "it is a reasonable approximation to use an exponentially decreasing coupling - matrix element in the simple form:@xmath91where @xmath92 is a coupling parameter and all quantities are in atomic units . the experimental results for the excitation functions for the b@xmath6states are shown in fig . 6 and are compared with the simple theoretical estimate @xcite    @xmath93    in eq .",

    "it is necessary to estimate the internuclear separation @xmath97 at which the transfer occurs . to find the cross section we need to determine the coupling parameter @xmath92 and the value of the matrix element @xmath98 to determine these values we use self - consistent procedure by varying @xmath99 within the interval @xmath100  and obtain an appropriate value of @xmath101 from eq .",
