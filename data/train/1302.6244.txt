    "approximately 1% of stars host hot jupiters , ousted from their birthplaces to short - period orbits @xcite via mechanisms that remain debated .",
    "proposed theories fall into two classes : smooth disk migration ( e.g. @xcite ) , and migration via gravitational perturbations , either by stars ( e.g. stellar binary kozai , @xcite ) or sibling planets ( including planetary kozai , e.g. @xcite ; scattering , e.g. @xcite ; and secular chaos , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "( see @xcite , dmj13 hereafter , for additional references . )",
    "we consider the latter class as also encompassing gravitational perturbations proceeded by disk migration ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "migration processes must not only produce hot jupiters  heavily studied , extensively observed gas giants orbiting within 0.1 au of their host stars  but also populate the region from 0.1 to 1 au , interior to the ice line ( beyond which large , rocky cores can grow and accrete ) but outside the reach of tidal damping forces exerted by the host star .",
    "we call this semi - major axis range the `` valley , '' because it roughly corresponds to the  period valley \" ( e.g. @xcite ) , the observed dip in the giant planet orbital period ( @xmath1 ) distribution from roughly @xmath2 days . the valley houses gas giants both on highly eccentric and nearly circular orbits .",
    "gas disk migration is unlikely to excite large eccentricities ( e.g. @xcite ) whereas dynamical interactions are unlikely to produce a substantial population of circular orbits .",
    "therefore this eccentricity distribution may point toward intermixing between two different migration mechanisms , one gentle and one violent .",
    "another orbital feature  the bimodal distribution of spin - orbit alignments among hot jupiters  is sometimes interpreted as evidence for two migration mechanisms @xcite .",
    "however , it may result from stellar torques on the proto - planetary disk @xcite , gravity waves that misalign the star s spin axis @xcite , or two regimes for tidal realignment @xcite .",
    "because tides are negligible in the valley ( except at the most extreme periastron , e.g. hd-80606-b , hd-17156-b ) , we can interpret trends more easily .",
    "excited inclinations and eccentricities can not have been erased by tidal damping .",
    "if _ two _ common mechanisms indeed deliver close - in giant planets , physical properties of the proto - planetary environment may determine which is triggered .",
    "a decade ago , @xcite discovered that giant planets more commonly orbit metal - rich stars , supporting the core accretion formation theory .",
    "independent and follow - up studies confirmed this trend for giant planets ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) but not small planets @xcite . neither the @xcite nor the @xcite samples exhibited correlations between stellar metallicity and planetary period or eccentricity , but now the radial - velocity ( rv ) sample has quadrupled .",
    "it is time to revisit the planet - metallicity correlation , but now to gain insight into the dynamical evolution of planetary systems _ following _ planet formation .",
    "another motivation is the puzzlingly low occurrence rate of hot jupiters in the vs. rv sample @xcite .",
    "targets have systematically lower metallicities than rv targets .",
    "we will show that differences in the planetary period distribution  not just the overall occurrence rate  between metal - rich and metal - poor stars may account for the discrepancy .",
    "we uncover new stellar metallicity trends in the eccentricities of giant valley planets (  2 ) , eccentricities of giant planets tidally circularizing (  3 ) , and giant planet period distribution (  4 ) .",
    "these correlations point toward planet - planet interactions as one of two mechanisms for delivering close - in gas giants (  5 ) .",
    "valley gas giants are unlikely to have formed in situ @xcite and exhibit a range of eccentricities ( @xmath3 ) ( figure 1 ) . here",
    "we consider rv - detected giant planets with @xmath4 , ( queried from the exoplanet orbit database ) , hd-81688-b ( @xmath5 ) , and xi - aql - b ( @xmath6 ) using @xcite s data ; adopt @xcite s @xmath7 for hd-96063-b ; and remove hd-104067-b because the rvs are unavailable . ]",

    "we impose stellar cuts of 4500k@xmath8k and @xmath9@xmath10 throughout the paper to limit our sample to main - sequence stars with with reliable effective temperatures and surface gravities in the input catalogue @xcite .",
    "( we use the sample in  5 . )    under the two migration mechanisms hypothesis , valley planets on nearly circular orbits moved in smoothly through the gaseous proto - planetary disk , whereas those on eccentric orbits were displaced through multi - body interactions . in figure 1 , we emphasize planets with large eccentricities by plotting @xmath11 . this quantity is related to the specific orbital angular momentum , @xmath12 , an important parameter for dynamical interactions .",
    "this scale also minimizes eccentricity bias .",
    "for example , as a result of noise and eccentricity bias , a planet truly on a circular orbit could have a measured @xmath13 .",
    "however , on this scale , @xmath14 would be nearly indistinguishable from @xmath15 .",
    "we divide the sample into planets orbiting metal - rich stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath160 , blue circles ) vs. metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath00 , red squares ) . only the metal - rich stars host valley planets with large eccentricities .",
    "the eccentricities of these 68 planets extend up to 0.93 .",
    "in contrast , the 26 valley planets orbiting metal - poor stars are confined to low eccentricities ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "overall , 26% of valley planets orbiting metal - rich stars have eccentricities exceeding that of the most eccentric one orbiting a metal - poor star .",
    "we assess the statistical significance of the low eccentricities of valley planets orbiting metal - poor stars .",
    "we perform a kolmogorov - smirnov",
    "( k - s ) test on the null hypothesis that the eccentricities of the metal - rich and metal - poor sample are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "we reject the null hypothesis with 99.4% confidence .",
    "using a test more sensitive to the tails of distributions , anderson - darling ( a - d ) , we reject the null hypothesis with 99.8% confidence .",
    "the results are insensitive to the exact metallicity cut and statistically significant for any cut located between -0.1 and 0.1 dex .",
    "finally , we perform a monte carlo simulation , randomly selecting 26 planets from the total sample of 94 valley giants . in only 0.4% of @xmath18 trials",
    "is the maximum eccentricity of the 26 planets less than or equal to the observed @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , with 99.6% confidence , we reject the hypothesis that the confinement to low eccentricities of the planets orbiting metal - poor stars results from chance .",
    "although the exact statistical significance is somewhat sensitive to the definition of the valley , which defines the sample size  e.g. , if we cut off the valley at 0.8 au instead of 1 au , our confidence is 98.3%  it is evident in figure 1 that the trend occurs throughout the valley .    as suggested by @xcite in the context of the mutual inclinations of multi - planet systems",
    ", one might expect a threshold metallicity to trigger instability . decreasing planets semi - major axes @xmath20 via gravitational perturbations requires interactions between at least two ( and probably more ) closely - spaced giant planets .",
    "it may be that only metal - rich proto - planetary environments can form such systems .",
    "in contrast , planets on circular orbits would have arrived via disk migration , which can occur regardless of metallicity .",
    "we note that beyond 1 au , the metal - rich and metal - poor sample have similar eccentricity distributions .",
    "planets with @xmath21 au have not necessarily changed their semi - major axes : they may have formed where we observe them .",
    "these planets on eccentric orbits near their formation location may have exchanged angular momentum with another planet or star without requiring the abundance of closely - packed giant planets necessary to drastically alter @xmath22 .",
    "we turn to planets experiencing significant tidal dissipation , detected fixed at 0 in eod fits .",
    "we remove those with poorly - constrained eccentricities : corot-7-b , hat - p-9-b , ogle - tr-10-b , ogle - tr-111-b , tres-1-b , tres-4-b , wasp-13-b , wasp-39-b , wasp-58-b , xo-1-b , xo-5-b .",

    "however , we attribute the systematic offset to the fact that stars targeted for spectroscopic follow - up are bright , main - sequence stars in our solar neighborhood and thus have systematically higher metallicities ; in contrast , the kic metallicities were computed assuming a low - metallicity prior , due to the targets being above the galactic plane .",
    "the planetary radius cut may also contribute to the discrepancy .",
    "the @xmath53 cut for the sample corresponds to the rv cut of @xmath54@xmath55 for a planet made of pure hydrogen at a low effective temperature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , close - in , low - mass planets may be inflated to @xmath56 and may have a different period distribution , contaminating the sample . in the metal - poor comparison ( figure 5 ,",
    "right ) , the and rv distributions do not appear inconsistent , but it is difficult to judge given the very small sample of rv - detected planets orbiting metal - poor stars .",
    "we found three ways in which the properties of hot jupiters and valley giants depend on host star metallicity :    1 .",
    "gas giants with @xmath57au orbiting metal - rich stars have a range of eccentricities , whereas those orbiting metal - poor stars are restricted to lower eccentricities . 2 .",
    "only metal - rich stars host eccentric proto - hot jupiters undergoing tidal circularization .",
    "the pile - up of short - period giant planets , missing in the sample , is a feature of metal - rich stars and is largely recovered for giants orbiting metal - rich host stars .",
    "hot jupiters and valley giants are both thought to have been displaced from their birthplaces .",
    "therefore these metallicity trends can be understood if smooth disk migration and planet - planet scattering both contribute to the early evolution of systems of giant planets .",
    "we expect disk migration could occur in any system , but only systems packed with giant planets  which most easily form around metal - rich stars  can scatter giant planets inward to large eccentricities ( trend 1 ) , some of which tides shrink and circularize ( trend 2 ) , creating a pile - up of short - period giants ( trend 3 )",
    ". moreover , these trends support planet - planet interactions ( e.g. scattering , secular chaos , or kozai ) as the dynamical migration mechanism of close - in giant planets , rather than stellar kozai .",
    "this is consistent with previous work by dmj13 arguing that stellar kozai does not produce most hot jupiters , based on the lack of super - eccentric proto - hot jupiters .",
    "we would not expect planet - planet scattering to typically result in nearby companions to hot jupiters , which have been ruled out in the sample by @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "one possible challenge for our interpretation is the lack of apparent correlation between spin - orbit misalignment and metallicity .",
    "however , spin - orbit misalignments are not necessarily caused by dynamical perturbations , and their interpretation is complicated because measurements have primarily been performed for close - in planets subject to tidal realignment .",
    "we recommend spin - orbit alignment measurements , via spectroscopy @xcite or photometry @xcite , of candidates in the valley , which are typically too distant to be tidally realigned .    to support or rule - out the interpretation that these metallicity trends are signatures of planet - planet interactions , we further recommend : 1 ) theoretical assessments of whether planet - planet interaction mechanisms designed to account for hot jupiters can simultaneously produce the observed population of eccentric valley planets , and 2 ) more sophisticated assessments of the trends we report here , using the target lists of recent rv surveys and , as undertaken by @xcite , a careful treatment of false - positives and detection thresholds .",
