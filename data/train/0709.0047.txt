    "although , there are already various models relying on materials such as quintessence  @xcite , @xmath4-essence  @xcite , phantom  @xcite , chaplygin gas  @xcite , and quintom  @xcite among many  @xcite , the identity of the dark energy is still mysterious .",
    "there are also many attempts to derive dark energy from the quantum vacuum fluctuation ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "a fundamental problem in all these models is that there is no obvious way to cancel the @xmath5 zero point energy from the quantum vacuum fluctuation . here",
    "@xmath6 is the reduced planck s mass . on the contrary",
    ", the holographic dark energy ( hde ) model has an intrinsic advantage over other models in that it does not need fine - tuning of parameters or an @xmath7 mechanism to cancel the zero - point energy of the vacuum , because quantum fields have less degrees of freedom from the start in this model , according to the holographic principle  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in this model , the cosmic coincidence problem could be also solved if there was an inflation with the number of efolding @xmath8 @xcite",
    ". however , hde model has its own difficulties  @xcite and the physical origin of hde itself has yet to be adequately justified .",
    "recently , we suggested that there can be a relation between dark energy and entanglement ( nonlocal quantum correlation ) which are the two great puzzling entities in modern physics  @xcite .    in this paper , we suggest a new idea that dark energy is originated from the erasure of the quantum information at the cosmic horizon .",
    "this idea linking dark energy to quantum informational concepts is not so strange than it may appear , because we can treat every physical process in the universe as essentially a kind of quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "we will show that landauer s principle applied to this cosmological information erasing implies the existence of non - zero vacuum energy having effective negative pressure .",
    "being one of main concepts in quantum information science  @xcite , landauer s principle states that to erase one bit information of a system irreversibly at least @xmath9 entropy should be increased and at least @xmath10 free energy should be consumed , where @xmath4 is the boltzman s constant and @xmath11 is the temperature of a thermal bath contacting with the system .",

    "thus , it is also expected that @xmath16 is approximately 1 as observed . recall that we get this result without introducing ambiguous parameters such as the uv - cutoff or @xmath44 in our calculation . with the simple and reasonable assumptions , hde with @xmath0 can be easily derived .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that if the event horizon of our universe is that of a black hole , using the black hole hawking temperature @xmath45 and @xmath46 one can obtain @xmath47 and @xmath48 , that is , @xmath35 . however , it is obvious that our universe is not exactly like a black - hole .    it is tempting to interpret the minimum free energy condition in eq .",
    "( [ de2 ] ) as the condition for the vacuum in a canonical ensemble , however , it is unclear whether we can treat the horizon as a thermal system in a canonical ensemble . in the next section we consider an alternative possibility that this condition comes from landauer s principle and dark energy has a quantum informational origin",
    "first of all , it is important to make a clear distinction between two terminologies , the information ` loss ' in black hole physics and the information ` erasing ' in quantum information science . by information",
    "` loss ' we mean , for example , a non - unitary transformation from a pure state to a mixed thermal state at a black hole . on the other hand the information ` erasing ' in quantum information science is a transformation from unknown states to a specific state by compulsion , a process usually @xmath49 the entropy of the state  @xcite .",
    "it is also different from ` measurements ' where the unknown states randomly collapse to one of measurement basis states .",
    "for example , consider an one - bit memory which consists of cylinder and an atom in it as shown in fig .",
    "1 . a thermal bath with the temperature @xmath11 keeps in contact with the cylinder . let us denote ` 0 ' ( ` 1 ' ) by locating the atom in the left ( right ) partition . to erase this memory we use the piston to push the atom into the left partition regardless of its initial position by investing a work @xmath50 .",

    "( see @xcite for details . )",
    "this energy is eventually converted to thermal energy of the bath increasing the total entropy of the @xmath55 system ( the bath+ the cylinder ) and saving the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "note that , for general systems , @xmath50 needs not to be a mechanical work .",
    "any free energy that can be used to erase the information and to reduce free energy of a system can play a similar role .",
    "work @xmath50 should be invested .",
    "note that the local entropy within the cylinder @xmath51 while the entropy of whole system ( cylinder+bath ) should not decrease .",

    "1 ) represented by @xmath56 , the work @xmath57 should be invested , if @xmath11 is fixed .",
    "this eventually increases the entropy of the bath by @xmath58 and the thermal energy of the bath at least by @xmath59 such that the total entropy increases by @xmath60 .",
    "alternatively , landauer s principle can be restated as the claim that the net free energy gain of the whole system during the erasure can not be larger than the work invested , i.e. , [ df ] & df_tot&df_bath+df_sys & = & d(e_bath - t s_bath)+d(e_sys - t s_sys)w_sys .",
    "otherwise , one can use the increased net free energy @xmath61 to run a perpetual motion machine of the second kind , because the free energy is a measure of the amount of work extractable from a system .",
    "this clearly violates the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "one can say that the erasure is done most efficiently when the above equality holds . in this case",
    "the work @xmath50 is used solely to erase the information and the net increase of the total entropy is zero . for this optimal case and @xmath11 fixed , ds_bath=|ds_sys| ,  de_sys=0 ,   w_sys = t|ds_sys|=df_sys , and the condition in eq .",

    ", we can expect that @xmath64 and the minimum free energy condition ( @xmath62 ) still holds for an optimal erasing process , where information is erased most efficiently . in this paper , we suggest that the cosmic horizon plays the role of the bath and is one of the most efficient information eraser saturating the bound in eq .",

    "as the horizon expands , the inside region ( @xmath19 ) is extended by engulfing the outer region ( the gray region in the figure ) .",

    "( note that this does not mean that normal particles outside the horizon can enter the region @xmath19 . )",
    "this is a kind of information erasure .",
    "since we are interested in the energy of the vacuum , for simplicity , we ignore the erasure of the information of matter at the horizon .    for a toy example , imagine the black dot in the figure as a ` vacuum ' qubit in the gray region . for the observer",
    "this vacuum qubit is initially out of the horizon and can be described as the maximally mixed state , @xmath76 having @xmath77 entropy . as the horizon expands , the region is reachable and the qubit becomes a part of the visible vacuum of the observer , which has zero entropy .",

    "where does the energy erasing information come from ?",
    "a similar issue exists in the inflation theory regarding the expansive reproduction of the vacuum energy during the inflation .",
