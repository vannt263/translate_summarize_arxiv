    "semiclassical properties of systems with mixed classical dynamics is a reach rapidly developing field of research .",
    "one of interesting results obtained in this direction is a chaos assisted tunneling .",
    "it was shown that the structure of the classical phase space of hamiltonian systems can influence such purely quantum processes as the tunneling  @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated in numerical simulations that existence of chaotic motion region in the classical phase space of the system can increase or decrease tunneling rate by several orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "typically one considers tunneling between kam - tori embedded into the `` chaotic sea '' .",
    "the region of chaotic motion affects tunneling rate because compared to direct tunneling between tori it is easier for the system to penetrate primarily into the chaotic region , to travel then along some classically allowed path and to tunnel finally to another kam - torus  @xcite .",
    "chaos assisted tunneling phenomenon as well as the closely related coherent destruction of tunneling were experimentally observed in a number of real physical systems .",
    "the observation of the chaos assisted tunneling between whispering gallery - type modes of microwave cavity having the form of the annular billiard was reported in the ref .",
    "the study of the dynamical tunneling in the samples of cold cesium atoms placed in an amplitude - modulated standing wave of light provided evidences for chaos - assisted ( three - state ) tunneling as well  @xcite .",
    "recently , the coherent destruction of tunneling was visualized in the system of two coupled periodically curved optical waveguides  @xcite .",
    "the most popular methods which are used to investigate the chaos assisted tunneling are numerical methods based on floquet theory  @xcite . among other approaches to chaos - assisted tunneling we would like to mention the path integral approach for billiard systems  @xcite and quantum mechanical amplitudes in complex configuration space  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will consider the original approach based on instanton technique , which was proposed in @xcite and numerically tested in  @xcite .",
    "instanton is a universal term to describe quantum transition between two topologically distinct vacuum states of quantum system . in classical theory",
    "the system can not penetrate potential or dynamical barrier , but in quantum theory such transitions may occur due to tunneling effect .",
    "it is known that tunneling processes can be described semiclassically using path integrals in euclidean ( imaginary ) time . in this case",
    "instantons are soliton - like solutions of the euclidean equations of motion with a finite action .",
    "for example , in euclidean yang - mills theory distinct vacuum states are the states of different chern - symons classes , and instanton solutions emerge due to topologically nontrivial boundary conditions at infinity . in this paper",
    "we will use a much simpler system to investigate the connection between the tunneling , instantons and chaos , namely the kicked system with double well potential .",
    "our attention will be focused on the behavior of the quasienergy spectrum when perturbation of the kicked type is added to the system .",
    "hamiltonian of the particle in the double - well potential can be written in the following form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 - mass of the particle , @xmath2 - parameters of the potential .",
    "we consider the perturbation @xmath3 where @xmath4 - value of the perturbation , @xmath5 - period of the perturbation , @xmath6 - time .",
    "full hamiltonian of the system is the following : @xmath7    euclidean equations of motion of the particle in the double - well potential have a solution - instanton . in phase space of nonperturbed system instanton solution lies on the separatrix .",
    "perturbation destroys the separatrix forming stochastic layer . in this layer",
    "a number of chaotic instantons appears .",
    "chaotic instanton can be written in the following form : @xmath8 it is a solution of the euclidean equations of motion . here",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 - chaotic and nonperturbed instanton solutions , respectively , @xmath11 - stochastic correction .",
    "it is convenient to work in the action - angle variables . using standart technique @xcite",
    "we obtain expressions for this variables in the following form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 - action and angle variables , @xmath15 - energy of the particle , @xmath16 and @xmath17 - full elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds , respectively , @xmath18 - elliptic integral of the first kind , where @xmath19 is integral argument , @xmath20 - modulus which is in the following way expresses through energy @xmath15",
    "@xmath21    we will use in our analytical estimations expression for the action of the chaotic instanton .",
    "we assume this action is equal to the nonperturbed instanton action corresponding to the euclidean energy which is less than one of the nonperturbed instanton solution .",
    "we expand expression ( [ action ] ) in powers of the ( euclidean ) energy difference from the separatrix @xmath22 , where @xmath15 - energy , @xmath23 - energy on separatrix , and neglect terms higher than linear one . as a result we has the following linear expression @xmath24 = \\pi j(e_{sep } - \\xi ) =   s[x_{inst}(\\tau ,",

    "when stochastic layer in euclidean phase space is formed under the action of the perturbation a number of chaotic instanton solutions appear , see fig .",
    "[ fig : strob0p01 ]  ( b ) .",
    "these solutions implement the saddle points of euclidean action functional and thus give significant contribution to the tunneling amplitude . in",
    "the some sense their role is analogous to the role of the multiinstanton configurations in the case of the nonperturbed system . in the framework of the chaotic instanton approach the width of the stochastic layer determines the contribution of these chaotic solutions of euclidean equations of motion to the tunneling amplitude .",
    "the stochastic layer width estimated using resonances overlap criterion .",
    "for this purpose we should expand the expression for the perturbation  ( [ eq : v ] ) in the series of exponents .",
    "at first we evaluate the coordinate @xmath27 of the particle using expression  ( [ angle ] ) in the following way : @xmath28 and rewrite it as a series of sines @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 $ ] - parameter ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 - the frequency of the particle oscillations . leaving only the first term in expression ( [ eq : x ] ) and performing simplifications of this relation",

    "we calculated the parameter of the resonances overlap .",
    "it is equal to relation of the resonance width in the frequency scale ( @xmath36 ) and the distance between resonances ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "first one is estimated as a frequency of oscillations of the resonance angle variable @xmath38 .",
    "the result is obtained from the equations ( [ dotj ] ) and ( [ dott ] ) using standart technique ( see chapter 1 and 5 in  @xcite ) .",
    "the resonance width is the following @xmath39 where @xmath40 - distance from the separatrix .",
    "the distance between resonances is calculating using the expression for the resonance levels @xmath41 .",
    "thus one can obtain @xmath42    using two last expressions ( [ eq : dw ] ) and ( [ eq : dw ] ) the parameter of the resonances overlap can be written in the following form @xmath43^{1/2 } \\gtrsim \\left[\\frac{\\epsilon \\ , \\nu}{\\delta h } \\right]^{1/2}.\\ ] ] overlap parameter is equal to unity on the boundary of the stochastic layer . using equation ( [ eq : k ] ) we can write the expression for the width of the stochastic layer in the following way @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the energy on the border between stochastic and regular regions , @xmath46 - some numerical parameter which can not be obtained in the framework of the criterion used .",
    "the tunneling amplitude for the perturbed system is a sum of the amplitude in the nonperturbed case and the amplitude of tunneling via chaotic instantons .",
    "the later can be evaluated by integration over action of the tunneling amplitude in nonperturbed system . using expression ( [ eq : s ] ) this integral can be transformed to the integral over the energy difference from zero up to the width of the stochastic layer  ( [ eq : dh ] ) : @xmath47 } \\ , exp\\ , ( - s[x_{chaos}(\\tau , \\xi)]),\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is a normalize factor . to calculate contribution of chaotic instantons we use approximate expression for the chaotic instanton action ( [ eq : s ] ) and listed above assumptions .",
    "integration over @xmath49 gives the contribution of zero modes  @xcite . as the result",
    "we get the following expression for the amplitude : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is tunneling amplitude in the nonperturbed system , @xmath52 - a time of the tunneling which is put to infinity at the end .",
    "the last exponential factor in the expression  ( [ eq : a ] ) is responsible for the tunneling enhancement in the perturbed system . in the nonperturbed case",
    "the width of the stochastic layer is equal to zero and the expression ( [ eq : a ] ) coincides with the known expression describing the ordinary tunneling .    substituting @xmath53 in formula ( [ eq : a ] ) by the expression ( [ eq : dh ] ) and expanding it in powers of the perturbation strength we can write phenomenological formula for the quasienergy splitting @xmath54 where @xmath55 we fix this phenomenological parameter value using the results of numerical simulations . for this purpose we perform the linear fitting of the numerical data for the dependencies on the perturbation strength and take average value of the parameter over these dependencies . as the result we have the _ single _ numerical parameter  @xmath56 for our phenomenological formula explaining all these dependencies .",
    "for the computational purposes it is convenient to choose as basis vectors the eigenvectors of harmonic oscillator . in this representation matrix elements of hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) and",
    "the perturbation ( [ eq : v ] ) are real and symmetric .",
    "they have the following forms ( @xmath57 ) : @xmath58,\\\\   v_{m\\ , n } & = \\epsilon \\ ; \\delta_{m + 1 \\ ; n } \\;\\sqrt{\\frac g2 } \\",

    "we used the value @xmath63 with parameters @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 . in numerical simulations size of matrices",
    "was chosen to be equal to @xmath67 .",
    "simulations with larger matrices give the same results .",
    "we calculate eigenvalues of the one period evolution operator @xmath68 and obtain quasienergy levels which are related with the evolution operator eigenvalues through the expression @xmath69 .",
    "then we get the ten levels with the lowest one period average energy which is calculated using the formula @xmath70 ( @xmath71 are the eigenvectors of the one period evolution operator ) .",
    "the dependence of quasienergies of this ten levels on the strength of the perturbation is shown in the figure  [ fig : qes ] .",
    "quasienergies of two levels with the minimal average energy ( thick lines in the figure  [ fig : qes ] ) has a linear dependence on the strength of the perturbation in the considered region .",
    "they are strongly influenced by the perturbation while some of the quasienergy states are not .",
    "performed numerical calculations give the dependence of the quasienergy splitting on the strength ( fig.[fig : de](a ) ) and the frequency ( fig.[fig : de](b ) ) of the perturbation .",
    "these dependencies are linear as it predicted by the obtained analytical formula ( [ eq : de ] ) .",
    "using least square technique we calculate the _ single _ numerical parameter @xmath56 which describes all numerical dependencies demonstrated in the figures [ fig : de](a ) and [ fig : de](b ) .",
    "relative error in determining of the parameter @xmath56 from numerical results is less than @xmath72 .",

    "double - well system is investigated in presence of external kick perturbation .",

    "the formula has the single numerical parameter which is determined from the numerical results .",
    "this formula describes ground quasienergy splitting as a function of strength and frequency of perturbation .",
    "it predicts linear dependence of the ground quasienergy splitting on these parameters .",
    "numerical results for the quasienergy splitting as a function of the perturbation frequency and strength demonstrate linear dependence as well .",
    "they are in a good agreement with the analytical formula .",
    "analytical determination of the parameter @xmath56 at the moment seems to be impossible due to estimative character of the analytical method used .",
    "however , it is not a large problem since this parameter can be evaluated with the high accuracy using the single dependence of the ground quasienergy splitting for any particular system parameters values .",
    "parameter @xmath56 determined in such a way allows to describe correctly all other dependencies of the ground quasienergy splitting on the perturbation strength and frequency for any other values of the system parameters .",
