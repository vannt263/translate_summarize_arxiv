    "<S> this quantity was generalized by smith to the notion of time delay matrix @xmath5 in multichannel scattering@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath6 , known as the _ proper delay times _ play an important role in considering interaction in low dimensional systems such as mesoscopic capacitors @xcite and quantum dots @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the delay times took more attention in chaotic systems and random potentials to provide a statistical description of the time spent by wavepakets in the interacting region and the fluctuation of physical observables directly related to , such as thermopower@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the delay time was obtained in the case of one - dimensional disordered systems by means of invariant embedding formalism in @xcite and also in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the more general result including the different classes of symmetry is obtained in @xcite but still for 1d systems ( one mode ) . </S>",
    "<S> the next step of treating the n - modes scattering problems , is more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> however , the authors of @xcite succeeded and gave the distribution of individual _ partial _ delay times defined as the energy derivative of the phase shifts @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the joint probability distribution of the proper delay times was finally obtained in @xcite which , expressed in terms of the inverse proper delay times @xmath8 , reads :    @xmath9    @xmath10 stands for the symmetry class(@xmath11 , under time reversal symmetry ( trs ) , @xmath12 broken trs , and @xmath13 broken spin - rotation symmetry ) . </S>",

    "<S> it is important to mention that this is true for all @xmath36 so that the size of @xmath23 is not required to be infinite and thus , all the cavities with different sizes are equivalent and lead to the same distribution of any observable expressed using the elements of @xmath1 such as the conductance@xcite or shot noise . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , this is not true for observables containing energy derivative of @xmath1@xcite so that more attention is needed . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath21 still ensures @xmath1 from ce and we will call this case as minimal chaotic cavity . </S>",
    "<S> this case is very interesting since all the matrices become square and @xmath1 is diagonalized with the same energy independent rotation that diagonalizes @xmath23 . </S>",

    "<S> proceeding the same way , we prove that @xmath54 exhibits the same distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we remind that since @xmath6 , @xmath43 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath23 are diagonalized by the same rotation , the distribution of the eigenvectors is the same as that of the eigenvectors of @xmath23 , ie uniform . </S>",
    "<S> that is why we restrict the study to the j.p.d of the eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> going back to @xmath6 , we notice that at the half filling limit @xmath56 ( the conduction band with uniform leads is @xmath57$]@xcite ) , we have @xmath58 and therefore , we immediately obtain from eq.(@xmath59 ) the j.p.d of the eigenvalues @xmath60 of @xmath6 at @xmath56 just by changing in eq . </S>",

    "<S> one can notice in eq.([invariance ] ) the presence of the expression of @xmath6 at the half filling limit ( @xmath58 ) this allows us to express the distribution @xmath75 at arbitrary energy as a function of the @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> one obtains from eq.([invariance ] ) the following formula : @xmath77 this means that all what happens at arbitrary energy in the conduction band can be obtained from the formula obtained at the half filling limit . </S>",
    "<S> the j.p.d of the eigenvalues @xmath60 at arbitrary energy reads : @xmath78 the function @xmath79 is defined as : @xmath80 . as usually for an open system , </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 are directly related to the conducting leads by the broadening @xmath42 : @xmath83 and @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> this result worths to stop on it to make some comments . </S>",
    "<S> first , we find that the repulsion term @xmath85 is absent in a sense that when @xmath86 the j.p.d of the proper delay times does not vanish as observed in eq.(@xmath87 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood if one notices that for this case ( @xmath21 ) the transformation between the eigenenergies @xmath88 and the proper delay times @xmath44 is not one - to - one . </S>",
    "<S> so , even though it is true that having two energies @xmath89 is forbidden by the symmetries corresponding to @xmath90 and @xmath13 , the situation @xmath91 is allowed , and this leads to @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> second , we notice that the delay times are bounded and lie in the interval of length @xmath92 which becomes larger and close to infinity at the bottom of the conduction band ( the continuum limit ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can notice also that the proper delay times , as defined here , can be negative and the only situation where they are always positive is at the half filling limit where the wbl is equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> this causes no problem since we know that a potential can induce a delay or an advance of the wavepacket@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + the numerical simulations of the case of two modes are shown in fig.[threecases ] . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure to obtain these figures consists in sampling hamiltonians from lorentzian ensembles , expressing the scattering matrices using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ parametrisation ] ) and then calculating the corresponding wigner - smith matrix @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> a histogram of its eigenvalues is done at the end . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical result @xmath93 of eq.([equation9 ] ) is plotted at the same time to check if the plotted surface passes from all the points obtained by sampling . </S>",
    "<S> the matching between numerical and analytical result is excellent . </S>",
    "<S> + the hamiltonian @xmath94 describing the chaotic cavity with a lorentzian distribution exhibits a density of states given by @xmath95 @xcite@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this formula simplifies too much at the fermi energy , where the electronic quantum transport is pertinent , to become @xmath96 which means that the mean level spacing at the fermi energy is @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([timedelay ] ) was obtained for a situation corresponding to @xmath98 and @xmath15 , that is to say , for a very small mean level spacing corresponding to the universality of the bulk spectrum@xcite . in this universality class , </S>",
    "<S> the use of the lorentzian ensembles is not pertinent and it can be replaced by the equivalent gaussian ensembles@xcite offering other properties such as the independence of the hamiltonian elements . if we consider now a mesoscopic system with a _ finite number of degrees of freedom _ </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath19 finite)@xcite , and work with a fermi energy lying in the bottom of the conduction band ( @xmath99 ) , the density of eigenvalues @xmath100 tends to vanish whereas the mean level spacing @xmath14 diverges(because @xmath101 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this situation corresponds to the edge of the spectrum with a physics different from that of the bulk . </S>",

    "<S> we prefer to use a decimation method which consists in taking out the whole sites describing the chaotic cavity and renormalize the sites ( and links between them ) to which they were attached ( black sites in fig.([cavity]))@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this procedure helps in lowering the dimension of the matrices we work with to @xmath114 size and thus the self energy @xmath29 becomes proportional to identity . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is exact ( up to non pertinent phase factor ) and ensures the same lorentzian distribution for @xmath115 with the same center @xmath116 and width @xmath117 @xcite@xcite which means that the final @xmath1 still belongs to ce . replacing @xmath23 by @xmath118 in eq.([parametrisation ] ) </S>",

    "<S> moreover , this goes beyond the time delay matrix , to all the observables which can be expressed using the elements of @xmath1 or @xmath125 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that , the larger is @xmath19 the more @xmath42 needs to get closer to zero . </S>",

    "<S> this mean density is defined as @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> after straightforward calculations we obtain the following result ( see appendix [ appena ] ) : @xmath127 the result is @xmath10-independent which goes back to the fact that the density of eigenvalues of the lorentzian hamiltonian is @xmath10-independent too@xcite . </S>",
