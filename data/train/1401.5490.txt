    "we targeted a single mask in the @xmath39-band while the cdfs was visible from the keck i telescope , yielding a total exposure of 204 minutes with an ab dither pattern .",

    "the two - dimensional data reduction was performed using a slightly modified version of the mosfire drp . this pipeline yields two - dimensional , sky - subtracted data for each slitlet , which are rectified and wavelength calibrated , in units of electrons per second . because mosfire has such high quality optics , the pixel size is almost constant across the field of view and there is little other distortion , so the final",
    "rectification is minor .",
    "the reductions for the two dither patterns , 10 and 12 , were done separately .",
    "the two reductions were then averaged , weighted by the exposure time for each separate stack .",
    "all the 2d frames were searched for emission lines by eye , and their fluxes were measured based on an optimal extraction @xcite using a gauss - hermite model . the line model was derived from the brightest line of a given galaxy ( i.e. [ ] @xmath25007 ) and was then used to extract the flux of the remaining lines .",
    "this was particularly important for lines that were either very faint or sat partially on a night sky line .    to estimate the errors of the line fluxes , we extracted background regions of the two - dimensional spectrum where no galaxy emission would occur in any of the dither positions .",
    "we used these background regions to generate fake regions the same size as the extraction region for the line .",
    "each fake region was made by randomly selecting background pixels at the same wavelength , thus building up the fake region one column of wavelength at a time .",
    "this preserves the photon noise in regions of high or low sky background .",
    "we used the same model as used for the emission line to extract the flux of the fake region of background pixels .",
    "we did this 100 times for each line and used the root - mean square as an estimate of the error in the line flux .    in the two right - hand columns of figures [ bstamps ] , [ bstamps2 ] and [ bfillers ]",
    ", we show the two - dimensional sky - subtracted spectra for each galaxy with a detected emission line .",
    "the sky - subtracted spectra are only shown in the wavelength regions of h@xmath1 and the [ ] doublet .",
    "for the overall zero - point of the spectra , we observed gd71 as spectrophotmetric standard .",
    "this observation was done with gd71 at an airmass of 1.04 for 120 seconds .",
    "this allows us to measure the conversion between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , for that exposure .",
    "the above procedure does not deal with the variable seeing and airmass for the observations of our mask .",
    "we correct this with a simple average flux correction based on a single star within our mask .",
    "the magnitude of the star as computed from the flux calibrated spectrum is @xmath55 mag ab , while its total ( 5  aperture ) magnitude is @xmath56 mag ab .",
    "this difference of 0.15 mag represents our estimated amount of flux lost between the typical observation of the cdfs in a 07 slit and the ideal observation of a star at almost zenith .",
    "therefore , we multiply all of our count rate fluxes by 1.15 .    as we have only one flux calibration measurement , we do not have a good estimate of the uncertainties on our calibration .",
    "@xcite found an uncertainty of 15% using a similar approach as we use . unlike that work",
    ", we will not include that uncertainty in our measurements errors .",
    "we compared the measured fluxes with the signal to noise of the lines .",
    "we found that for our sample , the 5@xmath47 limiting flux was @xmath57 , in good agreement with the expected limits from xtcalc , the tool for calculating exposure times .",
    "we detected emission lines for all our primary target galaxies .",
    "we also detected lines for three of our fainter lbgs that were secondary targets .",
    "we note here we used no pre - selection for these secondary targets .",
    "the resulting line fluxes and redshifts are listed in table [ spectab ] . for almost every spectrum , it was straightforward to identify the [ ] and h@xmath1 lines .",
    "for a few targets we do not detect h@xmath1 , usually because of night sky emission ( see figures [ bstamps ] , [ bstamps2 ] , and [ bfillers ] ) .    for two galaxies , bs006541 and bs009818 , we additionally detect h@xmath58 in emission . the part of the night sky that this line falls in , however , is full of telluric absorption features and our flux calibration is too uncertain in that region , which is why we do not list flux measurements for these lines in table [ spectab ] .",
    "the rest - frame optical redshifts tabulated in table [ spectab ] are average values , weighted by the significance of the detected lines .",
    "we find excellent agreement between our rest - frame optical redshifts and the pre - existing rest - frame uv redshifts .",
    "the average redshift difference is @xmath59 .",
    "for the 8 ly@xmath12 emitters ( laes ) among our sample , this corresponds to a velocity offset between ly@xmath12 and the [ ] line of 153@xmath60 km s@xmath37 , possibly indicating somewhat lower outflow velocities than in laes at @xmath61 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .      to measure the equivalent widths",
    ", we need an estimate of the continuum in the @xmath39-band for all our target galaxies . as none of our target galaxies",
    "have reliably detected continua , we used the ground based @xmath39  image to estimate their continuum fluxes .",
    "the calibration for flux loss we estimated in  [ cal ] is , in effect , a total flux in the spatial direction but an aperture of 07 in the dispersion direction , because the data and calibrations are all measured in a slit .",
    "we elected to measure the continua expected in the @xmath39-band by measuring the magnitude of each target galaxy and the star in a circular aperture with a diameter of 07 .",
    "this aperture magnitude for the star is @xmath62 mag ab .",
    "thus , the difference between the flux in the slit and the flux in the aperture is 0.23 mag .",
    "we add this offset to each of our @xmath39measurements when estimating the continuum to calculate the equivalent width .",
    "given the strengths of the rest - frame optical emission lines in the k - band , it is clear that these lines will contribute a significant fraction to the total k - band flux . in order to correct for this and",
    "to estimate the clean k - band continuum fluxes , we use a line - free star - bursting galaxy template from @xcite , to which we add emission lines with the individual strengths that we measured ( as listed in table [ spectab ] ) .",
    "this template was then rescaled to match the observed , aperture corrected @xmath39 magnitude for each target galaxy , from which we obtain the normalization of the line - free continuum .    in figure [ ews ]",
    ", we plot the rest - frame equivalent width distribution including all lines detected at @xmath63 .",

    "our observations therefore confirm that high equivalent width rest - frame optical lines result in a very large contribution of emission lines to the rest - frame optical photometry of @xmath67 galaxies , given the width of the irac bands of @xmath68 m . ignoring this effect can significantly bias the estimates of stellar masses in such galaxies , and it is therefore very important to derive reliable estimates of the equivalent width distribution of these rest - frame optical lines for large samples of galaxies in the future ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "to estimate stellar masses for our galaxies , we use the zebra+ spectral energy distribution fitting code @xcite with @xcite models at sub - solar metallicity ( @xmath71 ) and constant star - formation .",
    "we verified that the stellar masses do not change significantly if using different assumptions for the star - formation histories , such as exponentially increasing or decreasing functional forms .",
    "given the large contribution of rest - frame optical emission lines to the k - band photometry , we self - consistently add both nebular emission lines as well as nebular continuum emission to the templates .",
    "this is done by converting 80% of ionizing photons from these templates to recombination lines for h and he using case b recombination @xcite and adding metal lines relative to the h@xmath1 fluxes using the tabulated relations of @xcite .",
    "the duty cycle of star - formation at high redshift is currently still not well constrained observationally .",
    "based on clustering and the evolution of the mass - sfr relation across @xmath72 , it has been suggested that the duty cycle might be relatively low at @xmath73 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this can be tested with spectroscopic observations of balmer lines , compared to the sfr inferred from the non - ionizing uv continuum .",
    "the uv light we observe in high redshift lbgs comes from stars over a larger range in masses than the ionizing photons we indirectly observe in h@xmath1 emission .",
    "therefore , these two indicators measure , in effect , different star - formation time scales ( c.f . , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of continuous star - formation",
    ", we expect these two indicators to roughly agree , if there is no contribution to the uv or h@xmath1 flux from other sources such as active galactic nuclei .",
    "we plot the luminosity in h@xmath1 and the uv star - formation rate in figure [ sfrhb ] , along with simple relation between h@xmath1 and star - formation rate from @xcite .",
    "this relation assumes case b recombination to estimate the flux ratio of h@xmath1 to h@xmath12 , a factor of 2.86 , and converts the initial mass functions to a chabrier , another factor of 1.8 from the salpeter assumed by @xcite .",
    "both the h@xmath1 luminosity and the uv derived star - formation rate have been corrected for dust extinction assuming the dust extinction from @xcite with an @xmath74 .",
    "the extinction was derived from a1600 ( see  [ broadprops ] ) assuming the calzetti extinction law , with the stellar continuum having only 0.44 of the extinction of the emission lines .",

    "clearly , the observed h@xmath1 luminosities are in excellent agreement with the expectation from the uv - based sfr .",

    "the agreement between the two star - formation rates is excellent in the mean , with an average difference of only 2% .",
    "the overall good agreement between the two star - formation rate indicators implies that the h@xmath1 luminosity likely all comes from star - formation and that the star - formation histories of these galaxies have been relatively constant over a @xmath3410 - 30 myr timescale .",
    "furthermore , our finding provides a basis for predicting the balmer line luminosities for galaxies at even higher redshifts , where balmer line emission may contaminate the irac photometry",
    ". this will be essential for unbiased mass estimates using the large @xmath19/irac datasets over the candels fields in the near future .     and our estimates of the uv spectral slope , @xmath1 , for all galaxies with h@xmath1 detected at @xmath63 .",
    "for comparison , we plot the expected equivalent width for constant star - formation rate models with 0.2 solar abundance .",
    "we assume a @xcite extinction law , and relate the extinction to the value of @xmath1 using the relation of @xcite .",
    "we note here that the @xcite extinction law has the continuum extinction only 0.44 of the extinction in the nebular emission lines .",
    "the lines are for models with ages of @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 years , with thicker lines representing older models .",
    "as is evident , galaxies are consistent with having ages of 300 myr to 3 gyr , i.e. ssfr in the range @xmath80 gyr@xmath37 .",
    "this is similar to the average values found from photometry @xcite . ]",
    "the specific star - formation rates ( ssfr ) of galaxies at @xmath81 is currently highly debated .",
    "previous studies , however , were mostly based on quantities inferred exclusively based on stellar population fitting to the broad - band photometry . given our h@xmath1 equivalent width measurement , we can now start to derive a spectroscopic estimate of the ssfr at @xmath14 .",
    "the relation between ssfr and h@xmath1 flux comes about because the h@xmath1 flux is a measure of the star - formation rate , as balmer series emission can arise from ionizing photons in the star - forming regions , and the optical continuum comes from stellar emission which is a measure of the total amount of stars in the galaxy .",
    "this relation will be , however , modified by the extinction of both the optical continuum and of the star - forming regions , with the latter expected to have a larger opacity @xcite .    in figure [ ewb ]",
    "we examine the relation between the h@xmath1 rest - frame equivalent width and the slope of the uv continuum slope , @xmath1 , for galaxies in our spectroscopic sample .",
    "dustier star - forming galaxies will have larger values of @xmath1 , so this plot combines a measurement of the specific star - formation rate and a measurement of the amount of dust in the galaxy .",
    "we plot , with lines , models of a constant star - formation rate with different ages with the appropriate amount of dust to match the @xmath1 values on the x - axis .",
    "we use the dust model from @xcite and increase the extinction for the line emission using equation 3 from that work .",
    "our data fall along the line of model with a specific star - formation rate of 1 gyr@xmath37 , or an age of 1 gyr , a typical value for lyman break selected galaxies at this redshift @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of our observations was to analyze the emission line properties of @xmath14 star - forming galaxies .",
    "in particular , there is now growing evidence of increasingly high [ ] /h@xmath1 line ratios ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) with redshift up to @xmath82 , suggesting that the conditions for star - formation might be quite different at high redshift compared to local galaxies . with our sample of 18 galaxies with emission line detections we can now further test these observations at @xmath14 .",
    "in figure [ oxymass ] we plot the [ ] /h@xmath1 ratio as a function of mass .",

    "we use the mpa - jhu catalog of @xcite .",

    "we restrict the redshift range to @xmath83 .",
    "the resulting catalog contains 260,647 galaxies covering a wide range of properties and star - formation rates .",
    "each galaxy has a measurement of the h@xmath1 and [ ] flux and equivalent width .",
    "in addition , each galaxy has an estimated stellar mass and star - formation rate .",
    "the stellar masses come from the imaging data alone , and are thus comparable to our mass estimates .",
    "the @xcite catalog also contains a classification for each source , as either agn driven or star - formation driven .",
    "we use this classification to plot contours of agn dominated sources and star - formation dominated sources in figure [ oxymass ] . for our purposes , we combine both agn and star - forming classifications into one each .",
    "we plot those galaxies classified as ` composite ' in figure [ oxymass ] , but they are ignored when generating the contours showing where agn or star - forming galaxies are distributed in the figure .",
    "it is immediately clear from figure [ oxymass ] that the lbgs we have observed lie far off of the relationship of star - forming galaxies in the local universe .",
    "many of the galaxies lie in the part of the diagram where sources are classified as agn in the local universe ( illustrated by black contours ) .",
    "the highest mass galaxies lie in a region dominated by agn , while at lower masses our sources lie in a region which is completely devoid of local galaxies .    in order to increase the sample size of high - redshift sources ,",

    "as they tabulate the sum of the two [ ] lines , we multiply their tabulated line flux by 0.75 to estimate the strength of the 5007line alone .",
    "@xcite include a 15% calibration error for their flux estimates .",
    "when we estimate the errors on the ratios of the line fluxes , we remove that calibration error .",
    "all high - redshift measurements from the literature are shown as blue symbols in the lower panel of figure [ oxymass ] , clearly showing that a high ration of [ ] over h@xmath1 is an ubiquitous feature among star - forming galaxies at @xmath82 .",
    "we find a mean ratio of @xmath6  when we combine our sample with the rest from the literature , after removing the two galaxies in common between our sample and the sample of @xcite .",
    "it is also clear from the figure , that even after the combination with the larger sample from the literature , we find very little dependence of the line ratio on the stellar mass .      the high observed line ratios in our @xmath14 galaxy sample trigger the question , whether these are all dominated by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "in the local universe , we generally observe such high values of the [ ] to h@xmath1 ratio only in agns ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite find evidence for active galactic nuclei powering at least some of the @xmath84 population and that the lower redshift mass - excitation relations of @xcite still discriminate between agn and star - forming galaxies at @xmath61 , after only small modifications to slightly higher line ratios .",
    "thus , the high [ ] to h@xmath1 ratio we observe in figure [ oxymass ] could be , for the higher stellar mass galaxies at least , a result of black hole accretion . if the division remains the same at @xmath14 as at @xmath85 , almost all of the galaxies in figure [ oxymass ] would be classified as possible agn .    given the extremely deep x - ray data over the goods - south field , we can test for such agn contamination in our sample . using the chandra 4  ms catalog of @xcite",
    ", we search to see if any of our sources are obvious x - ray emitters . unsurprisingly ,",
    "none of the x - ray sources are within a point spread function half - width half - maximum of our spectroscopic targets .",
    "we then stack the images of @xcite , to see if we detected an average signal from the galaxies in our spectroscopic sample .",
    "when performing this stacking , we removed any sources detected in the @xcite catalog .",
    "we did this by excising a 7 pixel by 7 pixel box centered on the source , where each pixel is 0492 in size . to build up a background sample",
    ", we also extract postage stamps of random parts of the x - ray images .",
    "we required that our stamps have no sources within 25 pixels of the stamp center . thus , both our source stacks and our background stacks will have similar levels of contamination from undetected objects . as the chandra point spread function becomes larger with increasing radius from the pointing center , we only included background regions with centers whose radii were the same range as our sources .",
    "for both the source and the background stack , we extract a 5 by 5 pixel region at the center from the 0.5 - 2.0 kev soft band image . in our 200 background images",
    ", we found 955 counts for an average of 4.8 counts per image .",
    "we found 122 counts in our stack of 18 source images for an average 6.8 counts per source .",
    "this yields a net of 2.0 counts .",
    "this is not , however , statistically significant .",
    "we would expect , at random , a stack of 18 images to show 210 counts 17% of the time .",
    "because agn luminosity is correlated with the stellar mass of the galaxy , we additionally assembled a stack of the nine highest stellar mass galaxies in our sample .",
    "this stack has an average of 8.7 counts per image , for a net 3.9 , which only happens 6% of the time .",
    "this is still not statistically significant .",
    "we note also that larger samples of galaxies in this redshift range , selected by both photometric and by spectroscopic redshifts , show statistically significant emission , but at luminosities consistent with star - formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that for typical galaxies in this redshift range , the dominant source of the x - ray emission is not an agn , but rather star - formation .",
    "furthermore , for the galaxies for which we do have pre - existing rest - frame uv spectra , we confirmed that none of these sources show any evidence for the presence of an agn ( e.g. based on [ ] , [ ] , or broad ly@xmath12 emission ) .    in summary , we do detect an excess of x - ray events , especially in the higher mass galaxy stack , but it is not statistically significant .",
    "additionally , we do not find any evidence for agn contamination based on the rest - frame uv spectra .",
    "however , we can not completely rule out the idea that active galactic nuclei generate the high observed emission line ratios at least for some of the galaxies in our sample , in particular if they are optically thick for x - rays .",
    "star - formation can produce high [ ] to h@xmath1 ratios as seen in our sample .",
    "for example , the models of @xcite and @xcite have star - forming regions in intense starbursts producing [ ] to h@xmath1 ratios of @xmath86 .",
    "these models do not require especially low metallicity or high electron densities , but they do require high ionization parameters .",
    "for example , the peak [ ] to h@xmath1 in the continuous star - formation model of @xcite is 5.4 for a model with a metal abundance of @xmath87 and an electron density of 350 @xmath88 , while the electron density of 10 @xmath88 model produces a ratio of 5.2 .",
    "both models , however , require ionization parameters of @xmath89 , one to two orders of magnitude higher than found in local star - forming galaxies . when including the impact of radiation pressure in dense star - forming regions , the recent models of @xcite and @xcite can produce even higher [ ] to h@xmath1 ratios",
    ".    in all these models , a high [ ] to h@xmath1 ratio implies a significantly lower line strength , around 70 to 80% of the h@xmath1 strength .",
    "this is indeed observed in high redshift galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the above models provide a physical explanation for the large emission line ratios we observe , namely a combination of a large ionization parameter and radiation pressure .",
    "this implies that the conditions of star - formation are very different in these high redshift lbgs as compared with galaxies at the same stellar mass in the local universe .",
    "as was highlighted by @xcite and @xcite , galaxies with strong ionization parameters often have higher specific star - formation rates than the typical star - forming galaxies in the local universe . in figure",
    "[ oxyssfr ] , we plot the [ ] /h@xmath1 specific star - formation rate of galaxies in our sample , combined with the galaxies from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also show the location of local galaxies with star - formation rates of at least 2 @xmath44  and classified as star - formation dominated by @xcite .",
    "while the typical @xmath8 star - forming galaxy shows low ratios of [ ] @xmath25007 to h@xmath1 ( only @xmath90 ) and specific star - formation rates ( ssfrs ) of @xmath91 yr@xmath37 , a small tail of the local population extends to significantly higher ssfrs and higher line ratios .",
    "interestingly , this tail nicely connects up with the location of the @xmath15 sample .",
    "this suggests that ( 1 ) the ionization and/or the radiation pressure of hii regions is connected with the global ssfr , coupling a local and a galaxy - wide property , and ( 2 ) a small sub - sample of local star - forming galaxies exhibits similar conditions of star - formation as the @xmath15 population .",
    "these are the galaxies with similarly high ssfrs .",
    "note , however , that these local galaxies on average have a factor 4 - 5@xmath92 lower masses than our @xmath15 sample .",
    "as we have shown above , all of the observed lbgs have extreme star - forming conditions , very different from typical local galaxies .",
    "since lbgs are the dominant contributors to the total star - formation rate at this high redshift @xcite , this suggests that star - formation was very different in the early universe compared to the typical local galaxy .",
    "however , this depends on how representative our sample is .",
    "the galaxies in our sample , and those in @xcite and @xcite , are generally selected by ly@xmath12 emission .",
    "@xcite found that the median lyman @xmath12 rest - frame equivalent width for @xmath93 galaxies was 0  , implying that half of the sample shows emission .",
    "our sample is in agreement with that fraction ( 8 out of 15 show ly@xmath12 emission ) .",
    "combining our sample with that of @xcite , however , we find 24 ly@xmath12 emitters out of 36 galaxies . by random chance",
    ", we would not expect to draw 24 emitters out of 36 galaxies from the @xcite sample .",
    "thus it is likely that our the combined sample is biased towards ly@xmath12 emitting lbgs .",
    "when examining the properties of lbgs , @xcite also found that those galaxies with lyman @xmath12 emission generally had lower star - formation rates and lower amounts of dust extinction as measured by bluer values of the uv continuum slope @xmath1 .",
    "we find an average star - formation rate for our sample of @xmath94 , well in - line with the expectations of the lyman @xmath12 emitters in @xcite . from this , we conclude that our sample , and the ensemble of our sample with that of @xcite , resemble a sample of moderate lyman @xmath12 emitters in properties .    in summary",
    ", we may not extend our results to the whole of the lbg population but , that being said , our sample combined with that of @xcite seems typical for those galaxies with modest lyman @xmath12 emission , characterized by lower star - formation rates and lower dust content than typical lbgs .",
    "we observed 24  galaxies using the mosfire spectrograph , where 15  were selected by having existing rest - frame uv redshift measurements such that we could observe lines with minimal interference from night - sky emission lines .",
    "the remaining nine galaxies were @xmath95 lbgs that fell within the mask .",
    "for each galaxy , we measured stellar masses , uv spectral slopes , and star - formation rates using existing broad band imaging . from our spectra , we measured the strength of the optical emission lines h@xmath1 and the [ ] lines at 4959 and 5007 .      * every galaxy in our primary sample has a detected emission line .",
    "three out of the * nine * galaxies without a known redshift were also detected , pointing to the possibility of a more general survey of galaxies based on a photometric redshift selection alone . *",
    "the relation between the equivalent width of h@xmath1 and the specific star - formation rate from fitting a spectral energy distribution matches the expectation for a population with a specific star - formation rate of @xmath341 gyr@xmath37 , if the dust properties are modeled by the relation of @xcite . * using the standard @xcite dust correction based on the uv continuum slope @xmath1 , the star - formation rates from the uv and those inferred from the h@xmath1 line flux agree very well .",
    "this implies that the star - formation properties of these galaxies have been relatively constant on time - scales of @xmath3410 - 30 myr , with no evidence for bursty star - formation in these sources .",
    "* the ratio of [ ] to h@xmath1 is much higher , @xmath3 than in similar mass star - forming galaxies in the local universe .",
    "when we combine our results with other @xmath82 samples , the ensemble of 67  galaxies has a median value of @xmath6 , unlike the values of 0.3 to 1 found in the local universe .",
    "this implies that the typical conditions for star - formation at @xmath14 for uv bright galaxies are very different than in the local universe , requiring either much higher ionization parameters , or possibly strong radiation pressure to explain .",
    "* the line ratio of [ ] to h@xmath1 is strongly correlated with specific star - formation in the local universe .",
    "a tail of local galaxies with the highest ssfrs shows elevated line ratios similar to what we find for @xmath95 galaxies , thus linking our high - redshift sources with the physical conditions of @xmath8 galaxies .",
    "this correlation of ssfr and line ratio implies that local physics within star - forming regions appears to be correlated with the larger scale rate of star formation across a broad range in galaxy mass scales .",
