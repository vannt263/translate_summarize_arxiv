    "despite decades of research , the role of grain boundaries in the photovoltaic behavior of polycrystalline solar cells remains an open question  @xcite .",
    "the high defect density of grain boundaries generally promotes recombination and reduces photovoltaic efficiency .",
    "however , thin film polycrystalline photovoltaics such as cdte and @xmath4 exhibit high efficiencies despite a large density of grain boundaries  @xcite ( both materials grain size is on the order of microns ) .",
    "the unexpected high efficiency of these materials demonstrates the need for a fuller understanding of grain boundary properties , and their influence on the charge current and recombination .",
    "numerous nanoscale measurements using electron beam induced current  @xcite , scanning kelvin probe microscopy  @xcite and other techniques  @xcite have revealed that grain boundaries in these materials are positively charged ( although previous work has also argued for negatively charged grain boundaries  @xcite ) .",
    "interpretation of these measurements is often challenging due to extraneous factors , such as surface effects@xcite .",
    "however , the information obtained from these measurements is sufficient to inform the construction of relevant models of grain boundaries .",
    "these models in turn provide critical feedback on the validity of the qualitative conclusions drawn from experiments .",
    "the impact of charged grain boundaries on the photovoltaic efficiency has been studied using numerical simulations  @xcite , and to a lesser extent , analytic models  @xcite .",
    "these studies show that sufficiently large band bending at grain boundaries minimizes their impact on the short circuit current , but that grain boundaries always reduce the open circuit voltage @xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that the @xmath2 of cdte is far below its theoretical maximum , and is the metric for which the largest efficiency improvements are available@xcite .",
    "this highlights the need for a quantitative understanding of grain boundaries on @xmath2 .",
    "although simulations can provide insight , the nonlinearities of the system and the large number of material parameters make it difficult to formulate a complete picture of the system using numerical modeling alone .    in this work we present analytical expressions for the dark current - voltage @xmath5 relation of a @xmath1 junction with positively charged , columnar grain boundaries .",
    "we find that grain boundaries contribute substantially to the dark current .",
    "because the electrostatics around and at the grain boundary controls the grain boundary transport properties , but differs from the bulk @xmath6 junction , it requires new analysis .",
    "our analysis applies for grains which are not fully depleted and for materials with sufficiently high hole mobility .",
    "we show that the dark @xmath5 approximately determines @xmath2 and provides a closed form description for how charged grain boundaries reduce @xmath2 .",
    "our analytical results follow from studying a large number of numerical simulations , formulating a physical picture of the electron and hole currents and recombination , and translating this picture into a simplified effective model which describes the essential features of the full simulation .",
