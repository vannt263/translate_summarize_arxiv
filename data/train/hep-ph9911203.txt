    "the standard model ( sm ) is very successful .",
    "but it is almost certainly incomplete .",
    "for example , it does not fix the number of generations .",
    "so far it is not known why there is more than one generation and what law of nature determines their number .",
    "the lep determinations of the invisible partial decay width of the @xmath4 gauge boson show there are certainly three light neutrinos of the usual type with mass than @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this result is naturally interpreted to imply that there are exactly three generations of quarks and leptons .",
    "however , the existence of the fourth generation is not excluded , if the neutrino of this generation is , for unknown reasons , heavy , i. e. , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "that is , there still exists the room of the fourth generation .",
    "if we believe that the fourth generation fermions really exist in nature , we should give their mass spectrums and take into account their physical effects .",
    "in last two decades , many theorists have researched this question . for examples",
    ", refs.@xcite researched the mass spectrum of the fourth generation fermions in the minimal susy model and the supergravity model respectlivily . refs . @xcite",
    "considered only the fourth generation neutrino .",
    "@xcite discussed the limit on the masses of the fourth generation neutral and charged leptons , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which had been improved by lep1.5 to @xmath9gev and @xmath10gev .",
    "@xcite reported on a search for pair production of a fourth generation charge @xmath11 quark @xmath12 in @xmath13 collisions at @xmath14tev by the @xmath15 experiment at the fermilab tevatron using an integrated luminosity of 93pb@xmath16 .",
    "there were also many papers presented other problems about the fourth generation , such as the mass degenercy of the fourth generation @xcite , the vector - like doublet as the fourth generation @xcite , and so on @xcite .",
    "recently , it is noted that the s parmeter measured from precision electroweak data is in conflict with a degenerate fourth generation by over three standard deviations , or 99.8@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , one can get around this discrepancy by assuming that there is new physics which partially cancels the contribution of fourth generation to the s parameter ( such as additional higgs doublets , etc . ) . on the other hand , it is shown that the area of mutual inconsistency between the sm and mssm higgs mass bounds is found to be consistent with the four generation mssm upper bounds @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined the motivation of the existence of generation by operator ordering ambiguity and found that there should be four generations .",
    "it has been pointed that the fourth generation fermions would increase the higgs boson production cross section via gluon fusion at hadron collider @xcite .",
    "the decays of the fourth generation fermions have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "the introduction of fourth generation fermions can also affect cp violating parameters @xmath18 in the kaon system@xcite .",
    "there were several theoretical schemes to introduce the fourth generation in the sm .",
    "the most economical and simple one was considered in ref .",
    "the fourth generation model in this note is similar to that .",
    "but we limit ourself to the non - susy case in order to concentrate on the phenomenological implication of the fourth generation .",
    "we introduce the fourth generation , an up - like quark @xmath19 , a down - like quark @xmath12 , a lepton @xmath20 , and a heavy neutrino @xmath21 in the sm .",
    "the properties of these new fermions are all the same as their corresponding counterparts of other three generations except their masses and ckm mixing , see tab.1 ,    .the elmentary particle spectrum of sm4 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the numerical calculations we set @xmath22 and take the @xmath19 mass value of 50gev , 100gev , 150gev , 200gev , 250gev , 300gev , 400 gev @xcite .",
    "the ckm matrix elements obey unitarity constraints , which states that any pair of rows , or any pair of columns , of the ckm matrix are orthogonal .",
    "this leads to six orthogonality conditions @xcite .",
    "the one relevant to @xmath23 is @xmath24 i.e. , @xmath25 we take the average values of the sm ckm matrix elements from ref .",
    "the sum of the first three terms in eq .",
    "( 9 ) is about @xmath26 .",
    "if we take the value of @xmath27 given in table 2 , the result of the left of ( 9 ) is much better and much more close to @xmath28 than that in sm , because the value of @xmath27 is very close to the sum but has the opposite sign .",
    "if we take @xmath29 , the result would change little because the values of @xmath29 are about @xmath30 order , ten times smaller than the sum of the first three ones in the left of ( 9 ) . considering that the data of ckm matrix is not very accurate",
    ", we can get the error range of the sum of these first three terms .",
    "it is about @xmath31 , much larger than @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the values of @xmath2 in the both cases satisfy the ckm matrix unitarity constraints .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the decay of @xmath1 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . the formulas for calculating the coefficients @xmath34 in sm can be found in @xcite .",
    "similar to eq .",
    "( 5 ) , the wilson coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 which , in addition to @xmath37 , are responsible for the decay @xmath38 can be written in sm4 as @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 , the contribution of @xmath19 to the wilson coefficient @xmath42 , is easily obtained by using the expression in sm with substituting @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",

    "are shown in the figs.2a and 2b respectively .",
    "the five curves , which are corresponding to @xmath58=50gev , 100gev , 150gev , 200gev respectively in four fourth generation model and the sm one , almost overlap together .",
    "that is , the results in sm4 are the same as that in sm . in this case",
    ", it does not show the new effects of @xmath19 .",
    "we can not obtain the information of existence of the fourth generation from @xmath3 decays , although we can not exclude them either .",
    "this is because , from tab .",
    "2 , the values of @xmath29 are positive .",
    "they are of order @xmath30 .",
    "the values of @xmath59 are about ten times larger than them ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . furthermore , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 are approximately equal to the ones in sm .",
    "thus the contributions of @xmath19 to @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 in eqs .",
    "( 5 ) , ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) are negligible .    in the other case ,",
    "when the values of @xmath27 are negative , the numerical results are very different from that of sm .",
    "this can be clearly seen from figs .",
    "3a and 3b . from fig .",
    "3a , it is found that the deviations from sm depend on the mass of @xmath19 .",
    "the enhancement of the invariant mass distribution increases with increasing of @xmath19 quark mass .",
    "it gets to the most largest deviation , about @xmath68 enhancement compared to sm , when @xmath19 mass is 200gev .",
    "when the mass is taken to be 150gev , the invariant mass distribution is about @xmath69 low than that in sm . if the mass is taken to be under 100gev , it is about half of the sm one .",
    "even we take the mass of @xmath19 as a fitting value ( between 150gev and 200gev ) , the shape of the curve is very different from the sm one .",
    "so , in this case , the fourth generation effects are shown clearly .",
    "the backward - forward asymmetry is also different from sm and show its own interesting things . from fig.3b",
    ", one sees that the curves are much lower than the sm one when the mass of @xmath19 is taken to be under 100gev .",
    "the backward - forward asymmetry is almost vanishing as @xmath19 mass is equal to 100gev . when @xmath19 mass is 50gev , it is completely opposite to the sm one .",
    "but when we take the @xmath19mass from 100gev to 150gev , the deviation from sm becomes smaller and smaller . especially , when @xmath19 mass is near 150gev , the curve is very like the sm one .",
    "but when we take @xmath19 mass upper 150gev , the backward - forward asymmetry deviates from that of sm again . the deviation increases with the mass .",
    "the reason is that @xmath27 is 2 - 3 times larger than @xmath70 so that the second term of right of the eqs .",
    "( 5 ) , ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) becomes important and it deponds on the @xmath19 mass strongly .",
    "thus , the effect of the fourth generation is significant . in this case",
    ", the decay of @xmath71 could be a good probe to the existence of the fourth generation .",
    "in this note , we have studied the rare b decay process @xmath1 as well as the decay @xmath0 in sm4 .",
    "we obtained two solutions of the fourth generation ckm factor @xmath72 from the experimental data of @xmath0 .",
    "we have used the two solutions to calculate the contributions of the fourth generation quark to wilson coefficients of @xmath1 .",
    "we have also calculated the branching ratio and the backward - forward asymmetry of the decay @xmath1 in the two cases .",
    "it is found that the new results are quite different from that of sm when the value of the fourth generation ckm factor is negative , almost the same when the value is positive .",
    "therefore , the @xmath3 meson decays could provide a possible way to probe the existence of the forth generation if the fourth generation ckm factor @xmath72 is negative .",
