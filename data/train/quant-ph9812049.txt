    "quantum computers  @xcite offer the possibility of faster combinatorial search by operating simultaneously on all search states .",
    "for instance , quantum computers can factor integers in polynomial time  @xcite , a problem thought to be intractable for classical machines .    at first sight ,",
    "quantum computers seem particularly well - suited for np search problems  @xcite due to their efficiently - computable test of whether a given search state is a solution .",
    "quantum computers can apply this test to exponentially many search states in about the same time as a conventional ( `` classical '' ) computer tests just one and a variety of search algorithms have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "however , extracting a definite answer from this simultaneous evaluation appears to still give an exponentially growing search cost in the worst case  @xcite .    for general np searches , amplitude amplification  @xcite , using a test of whether a search state is a solution ,",
    "quadratically improves performance of heuristics consisting of many independent trials  @xcite .",
    "this is the best possible improvement for `` unstructured '' quantum methods , i.e. , those using only such a test  @xcite .",
    "moreover , this technique does not apply to more complex heuristics , e.g. , those involving backtracking , tabu lists , parameters adjusted based on unsuccessful trials , cached nogoods or other forms of learning , abstraction or extensive preprocessing .",
    "such heuristics often provide the best known performance , at least on average , for a variety of combinatorial searches .",
    "a focus on _ typical _ behavior of large problems is important because often the worst cases are far harder than most instances encountered in practice .",
    "thus , as a practical matter , there remain the questions of whether using problem structure in quantum algorithms can give more than quadratic improvement for the heuristics consisting of independent trials , any improvement at all for other types of heuristics , and less than exponential cost for at least some typical problems arising in practice .",
    "as one example , further improvement is possible for a quantum algorithm using detailed information on the distance of search states to solutions  @xcite , but in practice , such information is not readily available for most searches .",
    "addressing these questions requires developing algorithms using problem structure and determining their behavior for large problems . as with classical heuristics ,",
    "such algorithms are often difficult to analyze theoretically due to complicated dependencies among successive search choices .",
    "thus one is often forced to use empirical evaluation with a sample of problems . while quite common for evaluating classical heuristics , this approach is limited to small problems for quantum algorithms on current machines due to the exponential increase in time and memory required for the classical simulation .",
    "another approach , applied in this paper , evaluates average behavior over a simple ensemble of problems .",
    "such ensemble - based analyses provide insight into typical behavior for large problems  @xcite .",
    "an extreme case is single - step quantum search , i.e. , algorithms using only a single evaluation of structure associated with a problem .",
    "single - step search is very effective for highly constrained problems  @xcite , outperforming both unstructured quantum search and classical heuristics in these cases .",
    "can the technique used for highly constrained problems be extended to the more challenging case of hard search problems with an intermediate number of constraints  @xcite ?",
    "conversely , to what extent does the restriction to a single step limit the extent to which the capabilities of quantum computers can be used ?",
    "single - step search is particularly well - suited for an ensemble - based analysis , since it avoids the dependencies found in multistep quantum algorithms or classical heuristics .",
    "furthermore , single - step methods require far less coherence time than the unstructured algorithm with its exponentially many steps , and hence should be easier to implement .",
    "this is because maintaining coherence over many computational steps is difficult  @xcite .",
    "while this difficulty is unlikely to be a fundamental limitation  @xcite and small quantum computations have been implemented  @xcite , algorithms that minimize the required coherence time simplify hardware implementation .",
    "this paper gives an ensemble analysis for a single - step algorithm using the number of conflicts in each search state .",
    "we evaluate the asymptotic average scaling behavior directly , rather than relying on simulations .",
    "this result allows optimizing the algorithm , and also demonstrates a general technique for studying the average behavior of quantum search algorithms .",
    "we compare the asymptotic predictions to evaluations of small cases accessible to simulation , showing good correspondence even for small problems .    in the remainder of this paper , we first summarize the np - complete satisfiability search problem and then describe a class of one - step quantum algorithms for it .",
    "this class includes both the previous unstructured and highly constrained methods as special cases .",
    "we identify the best performing algorithms for satisfiability problems with differing degrees of constraint in the following two sections .",
    "we then present some additional behaviors of the algorithm and briefly consider extensions to more complex algorithms suggested by these results .",
    "details of the derivation are in the appendices .    as a note on notation , to compare the growth rates of various functions we use  @xcite @xmath0 to indicate that @xmath1 grows no faster than @xmath2 as a function of @xmath3 when @xmath4 .",
    "conversely , @xmath5 means @xmath1 grows at least as fast as @xmath2 , and @xmath6 means both functions grow at the same rate .",
    "[ sect.sat ]    satisfiability ( sat ) is a combinatorial search problem  @xcite consisting of a logical propositional formula in @xmath3 variables @xmath7 and the requirement to find a value (  or ) for each variable that makes the formula true .",
    "this problem has @xmath8 assignments . for @xmath9-sat ,",
    "the formula consists of a conjunction of clauses and each clause is a disjunction of @xmath9 variables , any of which may be negated .",
    "for @xmath10 these problems are np - complete .",
    "a clause with @xmath9 variables is false for exactly one assignment to those variables , and true for the other @xmath11 choices .",
    "an example of such a clause for @xmath12 , with the third variable negated , is @xmath13 or @xmath14 or ( not @xmath15 ) , which is false for @xmath16 . since the formula is a conjunction of clauses , a solution must satisfy every clause .",
    "we say an assignment conflicts with a clause when the values the assignment gives to the variables in the clause make the clause false .",
    "for example , in a four variable problem , the assignment @xmath17 conflicts with the @xmath12 clause given above , while @xmath18 does not .",
    "thus each clause is a constraint that adds one conflict to all assignments that conflict with it .",
    "the number of distinct clauses @xmath19 is then the number of constraints in the problem .",
    "the assignments for sat can also be viewed as bit - strings with the correspondence that the @xmath20 bit is 0 or 1 according to whether @xmath21 is assigned the value false or true , respectively . in turn , these bit - strings are the binary representation of integers , ranging from 0 to @xmath22 . for definiteness , we arbitrarily order the bits so the values of @xmath13 and @xmath23 correspond , respectively , to the least and most significant bits of the integer .",
    "for example , the assignment @xmath24 corresponds to the integer whose binary representation is 0100 , i.e. , the number 4 .",
    "for bit - strings @xmath25 and @xmath26 , let @xmath27 be the number of 1-bits in @xmath26 and @xmath28 the bitwise and operation on @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus @xmath29 counts the number of 1-bits both assignments have in common .",
    "we also use @xmath30 as the hamming distance between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , i.e. , the number of positions at which they have different values .",
    "these quantities are related by @xmath31 let @xmath32 be the number of conflicts for assignment @xmath26 in a given sat problem .",
    "an example 1-sat problem with @xmath33 is the propositional formula ( not @xmath13 ) and ( not @xmath14 ) .",
    "this problem has a unique solution : @xmath34 , an assignment with the bit representation 00 .",
    "the remaining assignments for this problem have bit representations 01 , 10 , and 11 .",
    "theoretically , search algorithms are often evaluated for the worst possible case .",
    "however , in practice , search problems are often found to be considerably easier than suggested by these worst case analyses  @xcite .",
    "this observation leads to examining the typical behavior of search algorithms with respect to a specified _",
    "ensemble _ of problems , i.e. , a class of problems and a probability for each to occur .",
    "a useful ensemble is random @xmath9-sat , specified by the number of variables @xmath3 , the size of the clauses @xmath9 and the number of distinct clauses @xmath19 .",
    "a problem instance is created by randomly selecting @xmath19 distinct clauses from the set of all possible clauses  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath3 is large , the typical behavior of random @xmath9-sat is determined by @xmath35 , the ratio of clauses to variables .",
    "in particular , for each @xmath9 there is a threshold value @xmath36 on @xmath37 below which most random @xmath9-sat problems are soluble and above which most have no solutions  @xcite . for @xmath12 ,",
    "this value is approximately @xmath38 .",
    "the quantum searches considered here are incomplete methods , i.e. , they can find a solution if one exists but can never guarantee no solution exists . for studying such algorithms , the ensembles would ideally contain only instances with a solution .",
    "for example , we could consider the ensemble of random _",
    "@xmath9-sat , in which each instance with at least one solution is equally likely to appear . unfortunately , this ensemble does not have a simple expression for the number of problems as required for the analytic performance evaluation given below .",
    "instead , for @xmath39 , most random problems indeed have a solution so random @xmath9-sat is useful for studying incomplete search methods for underconstrained problems .    randomly selected overconstrained problems",
    "usually have no solutions so random sat is not a useful ensemble when @xmath40 .",
    "an alternative with simple analytic properties is the ensemble with a prespecified solution . in this case , a particular assignment is selected to be a solution",
    ". then the @xmath19 clauses are selected from among those that do not conflict with the prespecified solution .",
    "compared to random selection among soluble problems , using a prespecified solution is more likely to pick problems with many solutions , resulting in somewhat easier search problems , on average .",
    "each clause in a @xmath9-sat formula conflicts with exactly one of the @xmath41 possible assignments for the variables that appear in the clause .",
    "thus the average number of conflicts in an assignment is @xmath42 .",
    "while this average is the same for _ all _ sat problems with given @xmath19 and @xmath9 , the variance in the number of conflicts varies from problem to problem . as described in appendix  [ sect.ensemble ] , the the variance for random @xmath9-sat is @xmath43 .",
    "thus when @xmath44 , the relative deviation decreases as @xmath45 and hence the number of conflicts in most assignments is very close to the average .    for random @xmath9-sat ,",
    "the expected number of solutions is  @xcite @xmath46",
    "quantum computers use physical devices whose full quantum state can be controlled . for example",
    "@xcite , an atom in its ground state could represent a bit set to 0 , and an excited state for 1 .",
    "the atom can be switched between these states and also be placed in a uniquely quantum mechanical _ superposition _ of these values , which can be denoted as a vector @xmath47 , with a component ( called an _ amplitude _ ) for each of the corresponding classical states for the system .",
    "these amplitudes are complex numbers .",
    "a quantum machine with @xmath3 quantum bits exists in a superposition of the @xmath48 classical states for @xmath3 bits .",
    "the amplitudes have a physical interpretation : when the computer s state is measured , the superposition randomly changes to one of the classical states with @xmath49 being the probability to obtain the state @xmath26 .",
    "thus amplitudes satisfy the normalization condition @xmath50 .",
    "this measurement operation is used to obtain definite results from a quantum computation .",
    "quantum algorithms manipulate the amplitudes in a superposition .",
    "because quantum mechanics is linear and the normalization condition must always be satisfied , these operations are limited to unitary linear operators .",

    "examples include permutations , rotations and multiplication by phases ( complex numbers whose magnitude is one ) .",
    "] of dimension @xmath57 . in spite of the exponential size of the matrix , in many cases",
    "the operation can be performed in a time that grows only as a polynomial in @xmath3 by quantum computers  @xcite .",
    "importantly , the quantum computer does not explicitly form , or store , the matrix @xmath54 .",
    "rather it performs a series of elementary operations whose net effect is to produce the new state vector @xmath58 .",
    "the components of the new vector are not directly accessible : rather they determine the probabilities of obtaining various results when the state is measured .",
    "search algorithms for sat problems use efficiently computed properties of individual assignments , e.g. , a test of whether a given assignment is a solution . with quantum computers",
    ", these properties can be evaluated simultaneously for all assignments . in this paper",
    "we focus on algorithms that make use of this simultaneous evaluation just once .",
    "[ sect.algorithm ]    single - step methods could be implemented in a variety of ways .",
    "one simple approach starts with an equal superposition of all the assignments , adjusts the phases based on the number of conflicts in each of the assignments , and then mixes the amplitudes from different assignments .",
    "this algorithm requires only a single testing of the assignments , corresponding to a single classical search step .    for a @xmath9-sat problem with @xmath3 variables and @xmath19 clauses",
    ", the algorithm takes the following form .",
    "the initial state has amplitude @xmath59 for each of the @xmath48 assignments @xmath26 , and the final state vector is @xmath60 where the matrices @xmath61 and @xmath54 are defined as follows .",
    "the matrix @xmath61 is diagonal with @xmath62 depending on the number of conflicts @xmath63 in the assignment @xmath26 , ranging from 0 to @xmath19 .",
    "because the number of conflicts in a given assignment is efficiently computable for sat problems , these phase choices can be efficiently implemented  @xcite .",
    "the mixing matrix is defined in terms of two simpler operations : @xmath64 .",
    "the walsh transform @xmath65 has entries @xmath66 for assignments @xmath25 and @xmath26 and can be implemented efficiently  @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath67 is diagonal with elements @xmath68 depending only on the number of 1-bits in each assignment , ranging from 0 to @xmath3 .",
    "these definitions for @xmath65 and @xmath67 lead to a mixing matrix @xmath54 whose elements @xmath69 depend only on the hamming distance between the assignments @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with  @xcite @xmath70    unlike previous algorithms , where phase choices are often just @xmath71 , this algorithm potentially uses a different phase choice for each number of conflicts and each number of 1-bits in an assignment .",
    "this procedure defines a class of algorithms .",
    "a particular choice of the phases @xmath72 and @xmath73 completes the algorithm s specification .",
    "for example , the choices @xmath74 , @xmath75 and the remaining phases set to @xmath76 gives a single step of the unstructured search algorithm  @xcite .",
    "another example is @xmath77 and @xmath78 , appropriate for maximally constrained 1-sat problems  @xcite .",
    "[ sect.scaling ]    to determine appropriate choices for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we can evaluate the algorithm , via classical simulation , for samples of random sat problems with small @xmath3 using a variety of choices for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "numerical optimization of average performance with respect to these choices then identifies values giving high performance for random @xmath9-sat .",
    "these optimal values show @xmath79 and @xmath80 vary nearly linearly with @xmath63 and @xmath81 over most of their range .",
    "this observation suggests that restricting consideration to such linear variation is likely to give a reasonable idea of the best such algorithms can perform , while simplifying the analysis .",
    "to further understand why such choices are appropriate for large @xmath9-sat problems , note that the number of assignments with @xmath81 1-bits is @xmath82 .",
    "so for large @xmath3 , most have @xmath81 close to @xmath83 .",
    "similarly , for the phases @xmath72 , provided the number of clauses is large , i.e. , @xmath44 , most assignments have nearly the average number of conflicts @xmath42 . for large problems",
    ", we can expect the behavior of the phases near the average values will be the only important choices influencing the algorithm s behavior .",
    "thus we consider an expansion around the dominant values of the form @xmath84 where the @xmath85 are constants , and similarly for @xmath72 .",
    "the first term in such an expansion just gives a constant overall phase factor for the amplitudes , which has no effect on the probability to find a solution , and so can arbitrarily be set equal to zero .",
    "the next term in the expansion , giving linear variation in phases , affects the solution probability . for assignments close to the average",
    ", this linear variation dominates the behavior .    from both the empirical observations on optimal phase values for small problems and the increasing concentration of values for @xmath81 and @xmath63 and @xmath3 increases , we are led to consider a linear variation in the phase values . if , in spite of these motivating arguments , including some nonlinearity in the phase values improves the leading asymptotic behavior , a restriction to linear variation would still provide a lower bound on the possible performance of single - step algorithms .",
    "thus we restrict consideration to phase choices described by two constants @xmath86 and @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 the terms @xmath90 and @xmath83 in these expressions just give an irrelevant overall phase to the amplitudes , but slightly simplify the analysis .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ sect.mixing matrix ] this choice for @xmath73 gives @xmath91 for example , when @xmath92 , @xmath93 as used for solving 1-sat problems  @xcite .    because @xmath63 and @xmath81 are integers , it is sufficient to consider values for @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the range @xmath76 to 1 . since changing the sign of",
    "both @xmath86 and @xmath87 simply conjugates the amplitudes , we can further restrict consideration to @xmath87 in the range 0 to 1 .    completing the algorithm",
    "requires particular choices for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the asymptotic analysis given below identifies optimal choices for these parameters based on the values of @xmath9 and @xmath94 .",
    "[ sect.analysis ]    when the phase choices are particularly simple , as with the unstructured search algorithm  @xcite , or the problem has a simple relation between hamming distance from a solution and number of conflicts , as in 1-sat problems  @xcite , the probability to obtain a solution , @xmath95 , has a simple analytic form . in more general cases ,",
    "the solution probability can only be evaluated with a classical simulation , limiting the study of more complex algorithms or problem structures to relatively small sizes . a third approach to evaluating @xmath95",
    "is to average over an ensemble of problems .",

    "specifically , for random @xmath9-sat , the average of @xmath95 scales as @xmath96 where the decay rate @xmath97 can be evaluated numerically for given choices of @xmath9 , @xmath37 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    given the ability to numerically compute @xmath97 , we can then optimize the performance of the algorithm , measured in terms of the average probability to find a solution , i.e. , minimizing @xmath97 .",

    "fortunately , the precision required is not particularly strict because the parameters appear in the exponents",
    ". in particular , an error of @xmath98 in @xmath86 or @xmath87 will give error @xmath99 in the exponent .",
    "thus only a square root precision in the implementation of the values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 is required . while by no means trivial , this shows the algorithm does not require exponentially precise parameter values to achieve the scaling .    as an example , for the weakly constrained case in  [ sect.easy ] , such errors in parameter values gives exponential decay of @xmath100 . to maintain @xmath101 behavior",
    ", @xmath98 must be small enough that @xmath102 , i.e. , the precision requirement is @xmath103 .",
    "the precise scaling due to errors depends on the size of the second derivatives of @xmath97 around the optimal @xmath86 and @xmath87 values . for @xmath12 , a root - mean - square combined error of @xmath98 in @xmath86 and @xmath87 introduces at worst a factor @xmath104",
    "this is greater than 1/2 provided @xmath105 .",
    "for example , weakly constrained problems with @xmath106 satisfy this requirement for a 10,000 variable problem provided @xmath107 , which allows , roughly , a 10% error in the parameter values .",
    "similarly , for @xmath108 , such parameter errors give exponential decay of @xmath109 , so the precision requirement is @xmath110 .",
    "[ sect.unstructured ]    as a point of comparison with the one - step algorithm based on the number of conflicts in assignments , the unstructured search algorithm  @xcite applies amplitude amplification to random selection , giving a quadratic speedup after an exponentially large number of steps .",
    "specifically , for a problem with @xmath3 variables and @xmath111 solutions , the probability in solutions after @xmath112 steps is  @xcite @xmath113 with @xmath114 .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq.solutions ] ) , for random @xmath9-sat with fixed @xmath37 the fraction of assignments that are solutions , @xmath115 , is exponentially small , and @xmath116 .",

    "this scaling is independent of the number of steps ( provided @xmath112 is constant ) .",
    "when @xmath112 increases exponentially with @xmath3 , specifically @xmath119 , then the probability of a solution with this unstructured algorithm is @xmath101 .",
    "more generally , given a classical or quantum method consisting of independent trials , each of which produces a solution with probability @xmath120 , amplitude amplification produces the quadratic improvement  @xcite with @xmath121 .",
    "thus the cost is @xmath122 times the cost for a single trial .",
    "this general result means quantum computers can improve on many classical methods .",
    "however this quadratic improvement is also the best possible for quantum methods based only on testing whether assignments are solutions  @xcite .",

    "[ fig.optimal ] , based on the analysis of @xmath117 .",
    "the behavior of the unstructured search depends only on the number of solutions , leading to the vertical groups of points in the figure .",
    "by contrast , the structured method shows considerable variation in costs even among problems with the same number of solutions .",
    "the full distribution of costs available from empirical evaluation of a sample of random @xmath9-sat problems can address questions beyond those possible by an analysis of average behavior .",
    "for example , to what extent do classical and quantum methods find the same problems particularly difficult ?",
    "[ fig.classical ] compares the expected costs using the single - step quantum search with a classical heuristic when combined with amplitude amplification .",
    "specifically , the expected quantum search cost for a single instance is given by @xmath128 . when used with amplitude amplification ,",
    "the expected cost is @xmath129 provided @xmath95 is known , and otherwise is up to 4 times larger  @xcite . for a classical comparison ,",
    "each problem was solved repeatedly with the gsat local search method  @xcite using a limit of @xmath130 steps for each trial : if a solution was not found after that many steps , a new trial was started .",
    "classically , the expected search cost is the ratio of the total number of gsat steps to the number of solutions found by these repeated searches .",
    "but when used with amplitude amplification , trials can not end early just because a solution is found , instead they must run to completion ( i.e. , the full @xmath130 steps in this case ) . while this makes little difference for large problems , where most of the cost is due to the many unsuccessful trials typically required before a successful trial , it does limit gsat s benefit from amplitude amplification for the smaller problems treated here .",
    "the cost of gsat with amplitude amplification is @xmath131 where here @xmath95 is the probability a gsat trial finds a solution and the factor @xmath130 counts the number of steps for each trial .",
    "the one - step method exploits amplitude amplification more effectively than gsat , giving somewhat smaller costs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.classical ] .    without combining with amplitude amplification ,",
    "the absolute number of steps required for the one - step quantum method is larger than the classical heuristic for these problems .",
    "this contrasts with sufficiently weakly or highly constrained problems where the quantum method requires @xmath101 steps while the classical search uses @xmath132 .",
    "the figure also shows a general correlation between search difficulty for the two methods , largely reflecting the variation in number of solutions , i.e. , both methods tend to have higher costs for problems with fewer solutions . examining just problems with",
    "the same number of solutions shows little correlation between the two methods .",
    "this indicates different aspects of problems ( beyond their number of solutions ) account for particularly hard cases for the quantum and classical methods .",
    "identifying these different aspects , and hence classes of problems for which quantum methods may be particularly well suited , is an interesting direction for future work .",
    "furthermore , this observation suggests a combination of techniques may be a particularly robust approach to combinatorial search , as has been studied for combinations of classical methods  @xcite .    as a final note ,",
    "the cost measure used here is in terms of number of steps , with a step corresponding to the evaluation of the conflicts in an assignment .",
    "this measure is commonly used for general comparisons among search algorithms , especially their scaling behavior .",
    "however one should also keep in mind the relation among these algorithmic steps , more elementary computational operations implemented in hardware and actual computational time  @xcite .",
    "this relation depends on the details of the hardware , overhead of any necessary error correction , the choice of data structures and compiler optimizations . for quantum computers , these details are not yet clear but the number of elementary operations to count the number of conflicts in an assignment will be roughly the same for quantum and classical machines .",
    "the ratio of actual times required for each step on quantum and classical machines will instead be mainly determined by the technologically feasible clock rates .    in summary",
    ", the analysis based on @xmath117 gives a reasonable guide to the typical search costs , confirming the improvement of the new algorithm over unstructured search ( both in performance and a reduction in the required coherence time ) .",
    "although comparable with classical heuristics for hard problems , it remains to be seen how the behavior seen here for @xmath133 scales to larger problems .",
    "in particular , @xmath133 is small enough to be relatively easy for gsat , with solutions typically found in just a few trials thus limiting the extent to which it can benefit from amplitude amplification .",
    "this section describes extensions of the analysis : to compute the variance in @xmath95 among problem instances and the asymptotic behavior of algorithms with more than one step .",
    "we then discuss how the analysis can be applied to algorithms incorporating additional problem structure , specifically the conflicts in partial assignments .",
    "[ sect.variance ]    the analysis described above gave the asymptotic behavior of the expected value of @xmath95 for random @xmath9-sat .",
    "the technique can also be applied to determine @xmath134 and hence the variance of these values among different problems .",
    "the result has the same form as the average , i.e. , @xmath135 though the analysis is somewhat more complicated .",
    "numerical evaluation for a variety of cases gives @xmath136 slightly smaller than @xmath137 , where @xmath97 is the decay rate for @xmath117 .",
    "thus the scaling of the variance , @xmath138 is dominated by @xmath139 and the standard deviation scales as @xmath140 , hence decreasing slightly slower than the average . this observation leads to a relatively large spread in the distribution of @xmath95 values among different problems , corresponding to the large variations seen in  [ sect.costs ] .",
    "in addition to indicating how close to the average instances are likely to be , evaluating the variance could be used as an alternate basis for selecting the phase parameters , namely to minimize the variance even at the expense of somewhat worse average performance .",
    "algorithms with different tradeoffs between variance and average could then be usefully combined in a portfolio approach  @xcite .",
    "the techniques used in appendix  [ sect.asymptotic ] extend to algorithms using more than one step , provided the number of steps remains fixed as @xmath3 increases .",

    "[ fig.wxyz ] in appendix  [ sect.asymptotic]to @xmath142 variable groups .",

    "@xmath112 , and in particular when @xmath112 increases with @xmath3 , other techniques will be necessary . nevertheless , the exact behavior as @xmath4 for a few small values of @xmath112 may suggest useful directions for designing improved algorithms .",
    "multiple steps also introduce additional parameters : different values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be used for each step .",
    "the simplest approach , taking the same values for all steps , gives only modest reductions in the decay rates compared to a single step . on the other hand ,",
    "allowing independent values gives larger reductions but requires numerical optimization of the decay rate with respect to @xmath143 parameters @xmath144 and @xmath145 for steps @xmath146 .",
    "evaluating optimal parameters for up to 4 steps gives values whose variation is nearly linear with the step number .",
    "in fact , restricting consideration only to parameters with linear variation , i.e. , of the form @xmath147 and @xmath148 gives a decay rate very close to that achieved when parameters are optimized individually for each step .",

    "although this range of @xmath112 is too small for definite conclusions , using the number of conflicts in assignments may give high performance , on average , when the number of steps grows only as a power of @xmath3 .",
    "this would contrast with the exponential growth in @xmath112 required by the unstructured algorithm . at any rate ,",

    "[ sect.unstructured ] , the decay rate is not improved by any fixed value of @xmath112 .      the algorithm presented above adjusted phases based on the number of conflicts in each assignment .",
    "classical heuristics often use additional properties to evaluate search states . for the quantum algorithm , these properties",
    "are readily included by additional phase adjustments .",
    "as an example , this section considers the enlarged search space of partial assignments , i.e. , states in which only some of the variables have assignments , as used in classical backtrack searches . in many search problems ,",
    "including sat , conflicts can often be recognized before all variables are assigned , immediately pruning all search states involving extensions to the partial assignment .",
    "this additional pruning often more than compensates for the larger overall number of search states",
    ". however , its effectiveness depends crucially on the order in which variables are assigned and , for each variable , the order in which each possible value is tried .",
    "one quantum approach for using the information in partial assignments considers _ all _ possible variable orderings simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "this in turn requires superpositions of all @xmath163 sets of variable - value pairs , including sets with multiple values for some variables , the so - called necessary nogoods  @xcite .",
    "this larger search space can readily represent more general constraint satisfaction problems , such as variables with different sized domains .",
    "although proposed as a multi - step algorithm , in analogy with classical backtrack searches that attempt to build a solution by extending partial assignments , for simplicity we consider here its behavior with a single step , starting from an initial superposition with equal amplitude for each set .    with this representation of the problem , the goal is finding a set in which each variable appears exactly once and which has no conflicts with the clauses of the sat problem .",
    "the simplest approach modifies the phase matrix @xmath61 of  [ sect.algorithm ] so @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the number of variables in each set with a unique assigned value , ranging from 0 to @xmath3 , and @xmath166 is an additional parameter for the algorithm .",
    "furthermore , to focus on the information available with partial assignments , @xmath32 is defined as the number of conflicts among only the uniquely - assigned variables .",
    "a solution is a set with @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the asymptotic analysis proceeds as in appendix  [ sect.asymptotic ] with two modifications .",
    "first an additional factor of @xmath169 appears in @xmath95 due to the increased search space size .",
    "second , the algorithm distinguishes among sets depending not only on the assigned values but also on the number of uniquely - assigned variables , giving nine groups of variables instead of the four used in fig .",
    "[ fig.wxyz ] of appendix  [ sect.asymptotic ] . with these changes ,",
    "the asymptotic analysis proceeds to give @xmath170 where now the decay rate @xmath97 depends also on the additional phase parameter @xmath166 .    for this algorithm ,",
    "[ fig.lattice ] shows the minimum decay rate for @xmath117 , and compares it to random selection among complete assignments and the one - step quantum algorithm on complete assignments of fig .",
    "[ fig.optimal ] . the resulting behavior is worse than the complete - assignment algorithm , but by significantly less than the addition of @xmath171 that one might expect just based on the increase in search space size by a factor of @xmath48 .",
    "thus we conclude the information available from partial assignments helps concentrate amplitudes toward solutions , but not sufficiently to overcome the handicap of the much larger search space , at least in a single step .",
    "importantly , the analysis technique introduced here gives a more definitive asymptotic characterization of the algorithm than is possible from empirical simulations . in turn",
    ", this characterization identifies good parameter choices for the phase adjustments that would be difficult to estimate from simulations .",
    "moreover , it allows comparing the benefits of different approaches to using the information available in partial assignment .",
    "for example , basing the phase adjustments on the total number of conflicts in a set of variable - value pairs , including those involving duplicate variables , gives worse performance than just counting conflicts among uniquely - assigned variables , an observation not obvious a priori .",
    "similarly , performance is not improved by allowing the phase adjustments to depend separately on the numbers of doubly - assigned and unassigned variables , rather than just their sum .",
    "on the other hand , generalizing the matrix @xmath67 used to form the mixing matrix @xmath54 in  [ sect.algorithm ] , so its elements @xmath172 have a phase adjustment based on the number of duplicate variables in the set @xmath25 in addition to the size of the set , gives a slight improvement in performance suggesting a further study of using the structure in this larger search space may be useful , particularly for multiple steps .",
    "we have shown how an analysis based on ensemble averages helps design quantum search algorithms .",
    "the result was evaluated for satisfiability problems in the hard region as well as the easier weakly and highly constrained cases .",
    "compared to unstructured search , this gives exponentially better average behavior .",
    "moreover , this performance uses only a single evaluation of the assignment properties rather than the exponentially large number of repeated evaluations required by the unstructured method .",
    "thus this single - step algorithm requires much less coherence time for the quantum operations . the algorithm can be combined with amplitude amplification  @xcite , giving an additional quadratic performance improvement , but then requiring coherence time extending for the full algorithm rather than just for each trial separately .",
    "classical heuristics use more problem properties than the algorithm described here .",
    "these properties include the difference between the number of conflicts in an assignment and those of its neighbors , and the conflicts associated with partial assignments .",
    "we illustrated how additional phase variation allows incorporating such information in the quantum algorithm , and how the analyses techniques developed here can be extended to identify suitable parameters .",
    "thus these techniques can help evaluate a variety of quantum algorithms that are not easily addressed theoretically and hence would otherwise require slow classical simulation .",
    "this evaluation requires only that the properties of assignments used by the algorithm and the nature of the ensemble allow for an explicit determination of the ensemble averages , in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ eq.psolnrandom ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in many respects this analysis is simpler than that for heuristic classical methods .",
    "this is because classical searches introduce dependencies in their path through a search space based on a series of heuristic choices .",
    "these dependencies are difficult to model theoretically .",
    "by contrast , the quantum search , by in effect exploring all search paths simultaneously , avoids this difficulty thereby giving relatively simple analytic expressions for the average behavior . on the other hand , this analysis is restricted to simple quantities , such as the average probability of finding a solution .",
    "how well this reflects typical search costs remains to be seen , though the discussion of ",
    "[ sect.costs ] suggests it gives a reasonable estimate , as well as determining good parameter values .",
    "classical heuristics often rely on behavior of states near solutions as guides , and can become stuck in local minima or among large collections of assignments with the same number of conflicts  @xcite . for the quantum algorithm ,",
    "local minima are not an issue : instead the limited correlation between distance and conflicts for states _",
    "far _ from solutions prevents efficient search .",
    "because of these very different characteristics , an interesting direction for future work is identifying individual problems or problem ensembles where the correlations are stronger even though the local minima for states relatively near solutions remain .",
    "in such cases , quantum algorithms could perform much better than classical heuristics .",
    "an important advantage of basing the algorithm on ensembles is the use of averages rather than requiring detailed knowledge of an individual search problem .",
    "this contrasts with the unstructured search method which requires knowledge of the number of solutions for a particular problem , or various values must be tried repeatedly  @xcite .",
    "an interesting open question is whether the algorithm , e.g. , the choice of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , could be improved by adjusting the parameters prior to search based on readily computed characteristics of an individual problem instance . in effect",
    "this would amount to using a more specific ensemble whose instances are more likely to be similar to the given instance than random problems .",
    "more generally , the variation in performance suggests a portfolio approach  @xcite would be effective for combining quantum algorithms using different parameter choices along with various classical methods .",
    "another possibility is combining this quantum algorithm more directly with classical heuristics consisting of independent trials , just as is possible for amplitude amplification . in this case , the heuristic is described not just by the probability to find a solution but by the probabilities it finds assignments with various numbers of conflicts , enhancing assignments with relatively few conflicts . then instead of starting with a uniform superposition of assignments , the initial state for the corresponding quantum algorithm would have amplitudes proportional to the square root of these probabilities .",
    "if the probabilities have a simple analytic form , the asymptotic analysis could be repreated , allowing optimal selection of the phase parameters for use with the classical heuristic .",
    "otherwise samples of the classical heuristic s behaviors could be used to estimate the relevant probabilities . while the resulting analysis will be more complicated than for",
    "amplitude amplificiation with nonuniform initial state  @xcite , using additional information in the quantum operations ( namely the number of conflicts in assignments rather than just whether they are solutions ) may allow for similar improvements as seen here for uniform initial conditions .",
    "these results show the usefulness of ensemble - based analyses for designing quantum algorithms .",
    "this is particularly helpful because empirical evaluation , through classical simulation , is limited to small cases . because quantum algorithms use properties of the entire search space , not just a small , carefully selected sample as with classical heuristics , ensemble averages are likely to be more useful for quantum algorithm development than is the case classically .",
    "thus quantum computing is likely to benefit from continued study of the properties of search problem ensembles , particularly for developing heuristic methods that work well for typical problems .",
