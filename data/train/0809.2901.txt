    "@xcite all these properties are drastically influenced by the presence of defects and dopants .",
    "@xcite for example , strong magnetic signals in nanocarbons have been reported after irradiation that seem to be associated with the creation of defects .",

    "@xcite in electron microscopy images of onion - like graphenic particles . in general , due to the stability of the substitutional configuration , the incorporation of transition metals to the carbon layer during growth or saturating existing vacancies seems a likely process . in spite of this , the magnetic properties of substitutional transition - metal impurities in graphenic systems have not been studied in detail . instead",
    ", most theoretical studies have focused on adsorbed transition - metal atoms on fullerenes and single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) .",
    "@xcite few calculations to date have considered ni@xmath0 impurities  @xcite and little attention was paid to the magnetic properties .    in this paper",
    "we present a first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) study of ni@xmath0 defects in graphene and armchair and zigzag swcnts of different diameters .",
    "we have discovered that the magnetic moment of substitutionally ni - doped graphene can be controlled by applying mechanical deformations that break the hexagonal symmetry of the layer , like curvature does .",
    "surprinsingly , ni@xmath0 impurities are non - magnetic in flat graphene .",
    "however , their magnetic moment can be switched on by applying curvature to the structure .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic moment of ni@xmath0 also becomes a signature of the metallicity of the structure : only metallic tubes develop a moment that depends on the tube diameter and ni concentration .",
    "this behavior stems from the peculiar curvature dependence of the electronic structure of the ni@xmath0 impurity .",
    "our calculations have been perfomed with the siesta code  @xcite using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite to dft and troullier - martins  @xcite pseudopotentials .",
    "our ni pseudopotential includes a pseudo - core with a core matching radius of 0.53  a.u . in order to perform non - linear core corrections for the description of exchange and correlation .",
    "@xcite we have tested that this pseudopotential yields the correct magnetic moment and band structure for bulk ni .",
    "we have used an _",
    "energy shift_@xcite of 50 mev to define the radii of the different orbitals .",
    "a double-@xmath1 polarized ( dzp ) basis set has been used for the calculation of the magnetic moments and electronic band structures of all our systems .",
    "however , we have checked that a double-@xmath1 ( dz ) basis yields to almost identical relaxed structures as the dzp basis and , therefore , we have used the smaller dz basis for the relaxations of systems containing more than @xmath2100 atoms ( our supercells contain up to 512 atoms , see fig .",

    "atomic coordinates were relaxed using a conjugated gradient algorithm until all force components were smaller than 0.05  ev /  .",
    "relevant lattice parameters were fixed to those of the pristine systems . to prevent spurious interactions the minimum distance between the walls of neighboring swcnts was 18   .",
    "the fineness of the real - space grid used to calculate the hartree and exchange - correlation contribution to the total energy and hamiltonian was equivalent to a 180  ry plane - wave cutoff . a good integration over the brillouin zone proved to be instrumental to converge the magnetic moment of ni@xmath0 impurities in metallic swcnts .",
    "the @xmath3-point sampling was equivalent to a 136@xmath4136 sampling  @xcite of the brillouin zone of graphene .",
    "we used a fermi - dirac distribution with k@xmath5t=21  mev .",

    "although both outward and inward displacements can be stabilized , the outward configuration is always more stable . the calculated ni - c distances ( d@xmath9 ) are in the range 1.77 - 1.85  in agreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "armchair tubes exhibit two slightly shorter and one larger values of d@xmath9 , the opposite happens for ( n,0 ) tubes , whereas for graphene we obtain a threefold symmetric structure with d@xmath9=1.78   .",

    "one of them is occupied and appears around 0.7  ev below e@xmath13 close to @xmath14 .",
    "this level comes from a fully symmetric linear combination of the 2@xmath15 orbitals ( z - axis normal to the layer ) of the nearest c neighbors interacting with the 3@xmath16 orbital of ni .",
    "two levels coming from the hybridization of the in - plane @xmath17 lobes of the carbon neighbors with the ni 3@xmath18 and 3@xmath19 orbitals appear @xmath20.5  ev above e@xmath13 .    as a consequence of this electronic structure , with the ni 3@xmath11 states well below e@xmath13 and no flat bands crossing e@xmath13 , the magnetic moment of the ni@xmath0 impurity in graphene is zero .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] are reminiscent of those found for the unreconstructed carbon vacancy in graphene  @xcite .",

    "x - axis is parallel to the tube axis and y - axis is tangential.,width=321 ]    the basic picture described above is still valid for the electronic structure of the ni@xmath0 impurity in swcnts . however , the modifications that appear due to the curvature of the carbon layer are responsible for the appearance of a magnetic moment .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ( a ) shows the band structure of a paramagnetic calculation of a ( 5,5 ) swcnt with a ni@xmath0 impurity every four unit cells . here",
    "the distance between neighboring ni@xmath0 impurities is similar to that of the graphene layer in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ]  ( b ) , although the ni concentration is 2.5 times lower ( 1.3  % ) . comparing these two figures",
    "we can appreciate the effects of curvature .",
    "the degeneracy between d@xmath20 and d@xmath21 states is removed ( x - axis taken along the tube axis and y - axis along the tangential direction at the ni site ) .",
    "the d@xmath21 contribution is stabilized by several tenths of ev and a quite flat band with strong d@xmath21 character is found _ pinned _ at e@xmath22 close to the brillouin - zone boundary . under these conditions",
    "the spin - compensated solution becomes unstable and a magnetic moment of 0.48  @xmath10 is developed .",
    "figures [ fig : fig3 ]  ( b ) and ( c ) show , respectively , the band structure for majority and minority spins .",
    "the exchange splitting of the d@xmath21 level is @xmath20.4  ev and the energy gain with respect to the paramagnetic solution is 32  mev .",
    "similar results are obtained using the vasp code .    in general , whenever a flat impurity with appreciable ni 3@xmath11 character becomes partially filled we can expect the appearance of a magnetic moment .",
    "the population of such an impurity level occurs at the expense of the simultaneous depopulation of some of the delocalized carbon @xmath15 levels of the host structure . for this reason",
    "the development of a magnetic moment is more likely for ni@xmath0 impurities in metallic structures like the armchair tubes .",
    "the crucial role of the host states also explains the delocalized character of the magnetization density depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]  ( b ) .",
    "however , it is important to stress that the driving force for the formation of a magnetic moment associated with the ni@xmath0 impurity in a swcnt is the local curvature of the carbon layer that shifts the energy position of one of the impurity levels downwards until it crosses e@xmath22 . a schematic representation of this phenomenon can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] where we also emphasize the similarities between the levels of the ni@xmath0 defect and those of the unreconstructed carbon vacancy . at large tube diameters",
    "we must recover the limit of flat graphene with zero magnetic moment .     in ( n , n ) tubes .",
    "the electronic structure of ni@xmath0 is similar to that of the unreconstructed carbon vacancy .",
    "one of the impurity levels with antibonding c 2@xmath17-ni 3@xmath11 character is shifted downwards and , for large enough curvatures , becomes partially populated and spin - polarized .",
    ", width=321 ]    for semiconducting tubes the situation is somewhat different .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19 derived levels will remain unoccupied unless their energies are shifted by a larger amount that pushes one of them below the top of the valence band . therefore ,",
    "if the tube has a large enough gap the magnetic moment will be zero irrespective of the tube diameter .",
    "we have explicitly checked that a zero magnetic moment is obtained for ( 8,0 ) and ( 10,0 ) semiconducting tubes for ni concentrations ranging from 1.5% to 0.5% .",
    "the different magnetic behavior of ni@xmath0 impurities depending on the metallic and semiconducting character of the host structure provides a route to experimentally identify metallic armchair tubes .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig5 ] displays the magnetic moment per ni@xmath0 atom for ni - doped armchair tubes of different diameters . all of them present a magnetic moment that oscillates as a function of the tube diameter and the size of the supercell used in the calculation , i.e. , the ni@xmath0-ni@xmath0 distance . for ( 4,4 ) , ( 5,5 ) and ( 6,6 ) tubes the first supercell showing a non - zero magnetic moment contains four unit cells . for ( 7,7 ) and ( 8,8 ) tubes this minimum length increases up to eight and six unit cells , respectively .",
    "the appearance of a complex oscillatory pattern as a function of the ni@xmath0-ni@xmath0 distance is easily understood if we recall that the magnetic moment critically depends on the energy position of a particular impurity level nearby e@xmath13 and the strong hybridization of this level with the delocalized states of the nanotube .",
    "another consequence of this hybridization is the long range of the interaction between ni@xmath0 impurities : for example , the magnetic moment in ( 5,5 ) and ( 4,4 ) tubes still presents strong oscillations in a range of ni@xmath0-ni@xmath0 distances between 20 and 40   .",
    "unfortunately , a meaningful exploration of larger distances between impurities requires a methodology different from the _ ab initio _ supercell approach used here .",
    "finally , we have examined the magnetic coupling between ni@xmath0 impurities in the ( 5,5 ) tube .",
    "we have doubled some of the simulation cells considered above , so they contain two ni atoms , and calculated ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) arrangements . only when the two ni@xmath0 impurities shared a common c neighbor the afm arrangement",
    "was favored by a few mev .",
    "fm configurations were the most stable in all other cases .",
    "although more work is necessary to accurately determine the size and distance dependence of the effective exchange interaction ( probably using model calculations similar to those in ref .  ) , our results indicate that ni@xmath0 impurities in small diameter metallic nanotubes , where they develop a magnetic moment , can exhibit relatively large fm couplings that slowly decay with distance .",
    "for example , for ni@xmath0 impurities at distances of 10    in a ( 5,5 ) tube we estimate a j@xmath23 of @xmath29  mev .",
    "this fm interactions can have important implications for the experimental detection of the curvature dependent magnetism of the ni@xmath0 impurities described in this work and its influence in the observation of magnetism in carbon nanotube samples .",
    "the calculations presented here show that substitutional ni impurities in graphenic carbon structures present a strong covalent interaction with their carbon neighbors .",
    "this interaction stabilizes the 3@xmath11 levels of ni that appear as a completely filled shell . as a consequence ,",
    "ni@xmath0 is non - magnetic in graphene .",
    "two unoccupied levels of the ni@xmath0 impurity appear close to e@xmath13 corresponding to antibonding combinations of ni 3@xmath11 orbitals and c 2@xmath17 lobes .",
    "curvature breaks the degeneracy of these two levels and , under appropriate conditions , shifts one of them to lower energies such that becomes partially occupied in metallic armchair tubes .",
    "in this situation the system develops a magnetic moment that exhibits a complex behavior as a function of the tube diameter and ni concentration .",
    "however , for semiconducting zigzag tubes the ni@xmath0 impurities remain non - magnetic .",
    "these results should be taken into account when studying the magnetic properties of carbon nanostructures .    in summary",
    ", curvature can be used to drive substitutional ni impurities between a magnetic and a non - magnetic state in metallic graphenic carbon nanostructures . in particular , the magnetic properties of substitutionally ni - doped graphene can be tuned by controlling the curvature of the layer around the ni@xmath0 defects . a possible way to do this is to deposit the graphene layer on a substrate with a small lattice parameter mismatch .",
    "this can cause the undulation and local bending of the graphene layer  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a similar non - magnetic / magnetic transition of ni@xmath0 might be obtained applying anisotropic strain to a flat graphene layer . in this regard",
