    "the exploration of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is undergoing a boom in both theoretical and experimental directions .",
    "the planning of two ambitious space missions , map and planck , to be launched in the beginning of the xxi - st century , is one of the sources of stimulus for research in this field .",
    "in addition , several long duration balloon - borne experiments are scheduled for operation within the next few years time",
    ".    many of the future cmb anisotropy experiments will perform circular scans on the sky .",
    "map , planck ( bersanelli et al . , 1996 ) , and the balloon - borne experiments tophat and beast ( lubin , private communication ) , will collect data from a large number of intersecting circles , which will then be merged into two - dimensional sky maps . smaller ground - based experiments as diabolo ( benot et al .",
    ", in preparation ) may scan on only a few circles . in winter 1997 for instance , a one - ring observation of anisotropies was done at the pom2 telescope in the french alps with the diabolo instrument . a common problem in the analysis of the data obtained by performing one dimensional sky scans",
    "is that all instrumental effects ( other than smoothing by the beam ) occur in the monotonic time domain of the data stream , but need to be projected onto the often complicated geometry of directions of observation , which is essential for the interpretation of the results . excess low - frequency ( typically @xmath5 ) noise , for instance , is an instrumental effect that is not easily analysed when projected onto two - dimensional maps ( delabrouille , 1997 ) .    in the following ,",
    "we explore the relation between the fourier spectrum of temperature fluctuations measured on a circle and spherical harmonic expansion coefficients on the sphere , with associated uncertainties in the framework of gaussian statistics , and investigate how circular scans permit to analyse naturally both the signal of cosmological origin and some of the effects coming from the instrument .",
    "the usual expansion in spherical harmonics of the statistically isotropic cmb temperature fluctuations on the sky observed with a symmetric beam reads :    @xmath6    here , the coefficients @xmath7 are assumed to be zero - mean gaussian deviates with variances given by @xmath8 ( on assumption of statistical isotropy of the cmb temperature perturbations , here expressed via the ensemble averaging ) , @xmath9 is the beam response function ( we have assumed for simplicity that the beam is symmetric ) , and a unit vector @xmath10 defines the position on the sphere .",
    "the functions @xmath11 are the orthonormal spherical harmonics , defined , for @xmath12 , as @xmath13 with @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the associated legendre polynomials .",
    "this definition of the @xmath16 , together with the fact that the temperature is real , implies @xmath17 .",
    "if only one ring of angular radius @xmath18 on the sky is being scanned , it is convenient to use coordinates such that the observed circle is the set of points of the sphere at constant colatitude @xmath19 . the cmb temperature on this circle , @xmath20 ,",
    "can be decomposed uniquely in the form of a fourier series : @xmath21    if @xmath7 are uncorrelated gaussian random variables , as expected in an inflationary scenario ( bardeen et al . , 1986 ) , the same is the case also for the ring mode amplitudes @xmath22 . the corresponding fourier spectrum , whose components we shall denote as @xmath23 , is the one dimensional analog of the @xmath24 spectrum on the sky . the anisotropy fourier spectrum @xmath23 is obtained from the @xmath24 spectrum by : @xmath25 and @xmath26 this last equation allows a straightforward computation of the ring anisotropy power spectrum @xmath23 given the instrumental specifications ( @xmath27 and @xmath9 ) and the cosmological model ( @xmath24 spectrum as a function of the relevant parameters ) .    figure [ fig : cl+gamma ] illustrates some properties of the ring spectrum @xmath23 as compared to the usual full sky spectrum @xmath24 .",
    "observational configurations chosen for the plot correspond to 1 ) a single ring scan of the planck satellite observing with the high frequency instrument ( the large ring ) , 2 ) a single ring of the tophat balloon experiment ( the intermediate ring ) , and 3 ) a hypothetical small ring and a narrow beam configuration .",
    "one should note that the ring anisotropy power spectra preserve the dependence on cosmological parameters observed by the @xmath24 curves , and , if the resolution of the instrument is good enough and the ring size sufficiently large , display clearly the array of adiabatic peaks .",
    "this promotes the strategy of observing the cmb anisotropy on the rings to a very interesting status .",
    "clearly one should be able to conduct a well guided analysis of such a data with the aid of a simple statistic , @xmath23 , which , due to the natural geometric reduction from the whole sky to the circle , captures all those features of theoretical cmb anisotropy predictions  direct reflection of physical processes that perturb cmb temperature in the shape of power spectrum , and the traceable dependence on cosmological parameters  which created high level of expectations for the full sky cmb mapping missions .",
    "ring power spectrum coefficients @xmath28 can be viewed as the estimators of the spectrum @xmath24 integrated over @xmath29 with a certain @xmath30-dependent window function whose coefficients are simply : + @xmath31 a number of such window functions @xmath32 , corresponding to the ring configurations used in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl+gamma ] , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : window ] . an important , if simple , property of these window functions , and , hence , the @xmath28 coefficients , is that the power at mode @xmath30 is generated by only those components of sky anisotropy for which @xmath33 .",
    "this is rather important for the suborbital attempts to measure the cmb anisotropy , which have to cope with the atmospheric effects .",
    "it has been the case for a long time that due to the variation from zenith to horizon of the length of path through the earth s atmosphere , and the associated systematic effects in the measurements of cmb temperature , the preferred scanning strategy in cmb experiments was usually along the lines of constant elevation .",
    "can one , in a suborbital experiment , afford to scan on any other circle than that at constant elevation ?",
    "if the atmospheric temperature gradient is predominantly large - scale compared to the size of the observing ring , its contaminating effects will be confined to low-@xmath30 modes of the ring anisotropy spectrum , and high-@xmath30 modes will be algebraically decoupled from such a source of spurious anisotropy .",
    "to what extent would a measurement of cmb anisotropy on the ring allow us to estimate the parameters of cosmological model used to describe the data ? to be able to answer this question we need first to clarify the statistical properties of circular modes of cmb anisotropy , and the properties of instrumental noise as projected on the ring geometry of observations .",
    "we shall see momentarily that the estimation of uncertainties in measurements of @xmath22 due to white noise , excess low - frequency noise , or instrumental systematic effects is simpler and more secure in the case of ring anisotropy than in the case of two dimensional maps used in @xmath24 estimation .      here",
    "we address the issue of cosmic variance of the ring modes of the cmb anisotropy .",
    "fourier coefficients of temperature fluctuations measured on the circle , @xmath22-s , are linear combinations of @xmath7-s , whose statistical properties they hence inherit . specifically , gaussian distribution of @xmath7-s renders gaussian distribution of @xmath34-s .",
    "statistical isotropy of the model cmb anisotropy field results in a very special property of the @xmath30-independence of variance  @xmath35 , which makes the @xmath24 spectral coefficients @xmath36 distributed . in the case of fourier coefficients of the ring data",
    "the number of degrees of freedom associated with a specific @xmath30 value is reduced to only two  @xmath37 waves have identical variance .",
    "hence , the cosmic variance on the @xmath28 coefficients is described by the @xmath38 probability distribution , independent of the value of @xmath30 .    in figure [ fig : error ] we illustrate the statistical properties of ring fourier coefficients of cmb anisotropy .",
    "the plot shows a few features of probability distribution of the rms power in mode @xmath30 .",
    "it is clear that the cosmic variance in the ring fourier coefficients is large , and , unlike in the case of full sky measurements of cmb anisotropy , when available at small enough angular scales , the statistics of power at high @xmath30 do not improve compared to those in low-@xmath30 modes , as the ring configuration allows just two degrees of freedom per mode , independent of @xmath30 .",
    "it is clear that the only opportunity for improvement of statistics of the measurements of ring modes of cmb anisotropy rests with repeating the observations on many rings .",
    "the essential issues of assessing the ring to ring covariance of the fourier modes of cmb anisotropy will be addressed in detail in a separate paper ( grski , delabrouille , and hivon , in preparation ) .",
    "now we turn to the estimation of the projection of instrumental noise onto a ring of data .",
    "noise , unlike the cmb temperature anisotropies , is a time - dependent process which is independent ( to first order ) of the position on the sky .",
    "the same is true of many instrumental effects in the measured signal ( system impulse response , sampling , ... ) , but we first limit our discussion to a simple gaussian noise as an illustration of the connection between the measured data stream and the signal reprojected on the ring .",
    "let us assume that data is collected by a total - power experiment as planck , tophat , beast or diabolo , and that a circle on the sky is scanned continuously @xmath39 times , with a spinning frequency @xmath40 ( spinning period @xmath41 ) .",
    "the output of each detector is a signal @xmath42 , whose value as a function of time can be written as : + @xmath43 in this equation , @xmath44 is the longitude angle on the circle .",
    "the way it depends upon time reflects the scanning strategy .",
    "@xmath45 is the useful signal from the sky , the temperature anisotropy smoothed with the beam .",
    "it is a @xmath46-periodic function of @xmath47 for fixed @xmath27 . if anisotropies are correctly represented by a gaussian random field , the fourier components @xmath48 of the fourier series decomposition of @xmath49 are realisations of the random variables @xmath34 defined in the previous section .",
    "the noise @xmath50 is assumed to be a realisation of a gaussian stationary random process with zero mean and a bilateral spectrum @xmath51 which , over a large range of frequencies , can be typically of the form : @xmath52 this is the simple case of the so - called @xmath0 noise .    given the signal timeline as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sn ] ) , the estimation of the fourier components of anisotropy on the ring can be done by computing the integral : @xmath53 under the present hypotheses ( no foregrounds , uncorrelated gaussian noise ) , this quantity @xmath54 is an unbiased estimator of @xmath34 , which variance originates in only two sources of uncertainty .",
    "first , there is the theoretical  cosmic \" or",
    " sample \" variance due to the fact that @xmath48 is just one realisation of @xmath34 , as discussed in paragraph 2.2 .",
    "second , there is the uncertainty due to the detection process ( due to the noise @xmath50 ) .",
    "let us denote as @xmath55 the quantity @xmath56 each of the @xmath55-s can be viewed as a realisation of a gaussian random variable .",
    "they obey the correlation statistics : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is given by : @xmath59    interestingly , but not surprisingly , there may be some correlations between fourier amplitudes of the noise reprojected on the ring , depending on the nature of the noise spectrum @xmath51",
    ". however , if the number @xmath39 of scans on a circle is large and the noise spectrum @xmath60 is not too steep ( @xmath0 is fine ) , the expectation value of @xmath61 becomes : @xmath62    thus , for each individual @xmath30 value , the uncertainty in @xmath63 induced by noise depends on @xmath40 through the noise spectrum value @xmath64 , and upon the total integration time @xmath65 . for a given experiment",
    ", the spinning frequency and total integration time should be optimised by comparing the level of the noise spectrum to the expected spectrum of the signal of astrophysical origin .",
    "usually , the noise spectrum decreases with increasing @xmath66 , and thus the minimisation of @xmath61 requires to spin fast , up to a compromise which depends on other experimental considerations .",
    "if the number of scans on a circle , @xmath39 , is large , and the noise spectrum @xmath60 is not too steep , the expectation value of @xmath67 averaged over sky realisations of the cmb _ and _ noise realisations is : @xmath68    thus a direct comparison of the signal and noise spectra for typical next - generation experiments is quite straightforward in the ring formalism and is presented here in fig . [",
    "fig : fig_g_m_noise ] .    in the top panel of figure [ fig : fig_g_m_noise ] , we have plotted together the rms values of @xmath28 for three different experiments and two different cosmological models , and the noise - induced sensitivity limits to individual @xmath28 components . experimental parameters chosen for the plot are representative of the next generation balloon - borne or satellite experiments .",
    "the pure white noise contribution , proportional to @xmath69 , has the shape of an exponential because of the logarithmic scale for @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath0 noise alone would appear on the plot as an horizontal line , with amplitude equal to that of the white noise at @xmath70 .",
    "as long as @xmath71 is smaller than a few , the excess @xmath0 noise induces a slight flattening of the noise curve for low @xmath30 , with negligible total additional noise power .",
    "apart from noise , there are a few effects of instrumental origin which can be understood much easier on timelines than on maps of the sky .",
    "some of these effects can be described as those of filters with a known impulse response , @xmath72 .",
    "the fourier transform of the impulse response , @xmath73 , is known in signal processing as the transfer function of the filter . for such filters ,",
    "the filtering theorem states that if a signal @xmath74 has a spectrum @xmath75 , the corresponding filtered signal , @xmath76 , has spectrum @xmath77 .",
    "two important instrumental effects can be addressed with this formalism .",
    "a typical bolometer for cmb anisotropy observations is a temperature - sensitive resistor heated by incoming radiation and cooled by a heat - conducting connection to a sub - kelvin thermal bath .",
    "the response of such a system to an impulse of incident power is : h(t ) = ( -t/ ) [ eq : h_time_constant ] the constant @xmath78 is known as the time constant of the bolometer .",
    "it is set by physical characteristics of the bolometer ( @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the heat capacity of the bolometer and @xmath81 the effective conductivity of the link to the thermal bath ) .",
    "however , other bolometer characteristics , and in particular the sensitivity of the bolometer , depend on the same parameters .",
    "thus , it is crucial , for bolometer optimisation , to understand the effect of the time constant of the bolometers on the spectrum of the useful astrophysical ( and especially cosmological ) signal .",
    "the transfer function @xmath73 corresponding to the impulse response of equation [ eq : h_time_constant ] is : h(f ) = using the relation between @xmath30 and frequencies of the signal , @xmath82 , the attenuation function @xmath83 on the @xmath23 corresponding to the effect of the time constant of the bolometers is : a_m = |h_m|^2 = and instead of measuring the quantities @xmath23 , the instrument measures @xmath84 .",
    "another instrumental parameter which needs to be set carefully by designers of cmb experiments is the sampling frequency .",
    "it should be high enough in order to avoid aliasing , but making it unnecessarily high results in a very large set of data , with the associated problems of data storage and telemetry , especially for satellite or long duration ballooning experiments .",
    "again , the effect of the sampling rate can be understood very simply as that of a filter .",
    "if sampling is modelled by a perfect integrator over a period @xmath85 ( which is the inverse of the sampling rate ) for obtaining each sample , the corresponding impulse response is : h(t ) = ( t_0 ) , where @xmath86 is the function whose value is 1 between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and 0 elsewhere . the corresponding transfer function is h(f ) = and the corresponding attenuation function @xmath83 on the @xmath23 is : a_m = |h_m|^2 =    attenuation functions for these two effects are plotted in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : fig_g_m_noise ] .",
    "in this paper , we presented the formalism to project the cmb anisotropy predictions and instumental noise effects on the rings of data . because of the feasibility of experimental setup for cmb observations with circular scans , and simplicity of the data analysis on such scans",
    ", we believe that collecting cmb anisotropy data in this format is an interesting option for the next generation of anisotropy experiments .",
    "it provides a natural frame for studying the statistics of cmb anisotropies , in which many instrumental effects can be modelled and analysed under the most natural connection between the time stream of data and the spatial distribution of the directions of measurements .",
    "we attempted to illustrate this point comprehensively in our figure [ fig : fig_g_m_noise ] . given that this comparative plot allows to present simultaneously a natural rendition of a number of factors that affect the attempts to measure the cmb anisotropy on the celestial rings , we believe that fig . [",
    "fig : fig_g_m_noise ] should provide significant insights on optimization of experimental setup for future cmb experiments .    for the most ambitious cmb programmes such as planck",
    ", many such scans will have to be merged into two - dimensional maps .",
    "the circular scan method described in this paper is a useful intermediate step in the analysis of such data in the global analysis of cmb anisotropies on the celestial sphere .",
    "original inspiration for kmg to consider the circular scanning came from discussions of the ucsb hacme experiment with p. lubin and m. seiffert , whereas jd s interest in the subject was stimulated by discussions with franois - xavier dsert and jean - loup puget over the choice of an optimal scanning strategy for the diabolo 1997 observations .",
    "jd would like to thank eric aubourg , nathalie palanque - delabrouille and simon prunet for help and suggestions in numerical computations of @xmath28 s for the first draft of this paper .",
