    "the magellanic clouds are harbours to millions of stars .",
    "the light of each of these objects can be magnified if another massive object is close enough to the line - of - sight connecting the observer and a distant star .",
    "@xcite first realised that with the advent of ccds , forthcoming massive photometric surveys could effectively test the hypothesis that dark matter in the galactic halo can clump and form massive compact halo objects ( machos ) .",
    "these objects , if they existed , would act as lenses to more distant lmc / smc stars , within the reach of current observing facilities .",
    "this brilliant , yet simple idea triggered several microlensing programs to emerge .",
    "the first detections of the microlensing effect were reported by the macho @xcite , ogle @xcite , eros @xcite , moa @xcite , angstrom @xcite , point - agape @xcite , and wecapp @xcite microlensing teams .",
    "for almost two decades , microlensing as an astrophysical tool has been very successful in finding objects which do not emit any or emit little light .",
    "the ogle group alone have discovered over 4000 ordinary microlensing events to date .",
    "a list of exotic microlensing events includes detection of black - holes ( e.g.,@xcite ) , planets ( e.g.,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , binary stars @xcite and also a variety of effects such as the parallax ( e.g.,@xcite , @xcite ) , xallarap @xcite , etc .",
    "however , since the microlensing field has evolved into a tool nowadays primarily concentrated on finding either the most distant or the smallest known planets , paczyski s original idea has been somewhat forgotten .",
    "the primary motivation for this paper is to fully explore the existing ogle data to search for microlensing events towards the magellanic clouds . as of 2010",
    "we have collected approximately 13 seasons ( 4 seasons of ogle - ii and 9 seasons of ogle - iii ) of data for both the lmc and smc . in @xcite ( hereafter paper i )",
    "we presented our first estimate of the microlensing optical depth towards the lmc from the ogle - ii data .",
    "the detection of two events led to the optical depth of @xmath4 .",
    "however , the macho collaboration derived the optical depth of @xmath5 based on their 10 candidates ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if this number is compared to the optical depth for the galactic halo entirely made of machos , @xmath6 ( @xcite ) , it gives the fractional contribution of @xmath7/@xmath8 20 per cent . on the other hand ,",
    "the eros collaboration has derived @xmath9 , which translates to @xmath10 per cent only @xcite .",
    "the ogle  ii estimate of @xmath11 per cent from paper i , favours the eros solution but the two detected events are also consistent with the expected lmc self - lensing signal .",
    "the smc has received somewhat less attention in terms of microlensing studies than the lmc .",
    "so far , only the eros data were studied systematically and the optical depth of @xmath12 was derived for one microlensing event detected in their bright stars sample @xcite .",
    "another study of 5 years of the eros data gives @xmath13 for objects with masses @xmath14 to @xmath15 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the macho collaboration estimated the optical depth to be @xmath16 based on their two events @xcite .",
    "the smc self - lensing estimates are in a range of @xmath17@xmath18 from n - body simulations by @xcite and from analytical work of @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend our work from paper i , on search for dark matter compact objects in the galactic halo , to an independent smc data set collected by ogle during its second phase in years 19962000 .",
    "the paper has the following structure .",
    "first , the empirical optical depth estimator is described .",
    "then the observational data used in the analysis are presented in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "next , in section [ sec : search ] the search procedure for events is described and its yield presented .",
    "the detection efficiency of events and the calculation of the optical depth is discussed in section [ sec : results][sec : tau ] .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion of the results .",
    "a review of the microlensing - related quantities is given in @xcite and @xcite . in short , the time - scale ( einstein radius crossing time ) @xmath19 is the only physical parameter of an event that , in the simplest case , can be derived while fitting an observed light curve with the microlensing model .",
    "the basic point - lens point - source microlensing light curve @xcite is described by    @xmath20,\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the observed magnitude at a given moment of time @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the baseline magnitude ( away from the peak ) and @xmath24 is the ratio of the lensed source flux to the total flux of stars within the seeing disk ( blending parameter ) .",
    "the amplification @xmath25 then depends on the lensing geometry , which changes with time , and can be evaluated with the equations @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the impact parameter and @xmath28 is the time of the maximum of the peak .",
    "we calculate the empirical optical depth following @xcite as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the time - span of all observations , @xmath31 is the total number of monitored stars , @xmath32 is the total number of events , @xmath33 is the time - scale of individual events detected with the efficiency of @xmath34 .",
    "the non - trivial parts of the estimator are the total number of monitored stars and the detection efficiency , and they are described in detail in section [ sec : blending ] .",

    "the photometry of the template images contain about 2.1 million objects in @xmath41 and @xmath45band colours suitable for our study .",
    "the search for microlensing events and determination of the detection efficiency were performed using the @xmath41 band data only , as these were far more numerous and were sampled more frequently as compared to the @xmath45band light curves . in this paper",

    "before we start the search procedure , all @xmath43-band photometric measurements have to have their error - bars corrected , since dia is known to underestimate the photometric error - bars ( @xcite ) .",

    "the main objective of this paper is to find rare microlensing events amongst millions of smc stars .",
    "the task requires a number of steps to iteratively remove all unwanted , contaminating light curves .",
    "our search procedure begins by pulling out light curves from the database with more than 80 epochs and the mean @xmath43-band magnitude brighter than 21.0 mag ( cut 0 ) .",
    "this sample of 2.1 million light curves becomes our all stars sample .",
    "the following steps along with the number of objects left after each cut are detailed in table [ tab : conditions ] .",
    "we use the same search pipeline as in paper i , however , the exact parameters of the cuts were fine - tuned independently for ogle  ii smc data with the monte carlo simulations .",
    "one of the main differences is in cut 0 , where the depth of the search has changed from @xmath53 mag ( lmc ) to @xmath42 mag ( smc ) due to a lessen crowding and greater distance modulus . another important change , as compared to paper i , is the definition of the `` blue bumper '' region ( cut 2 ) .",
    "the magnitude limit is chosen to be @xmath54 mag fainter , than for the lmc , due to larger distance modulus of the smc .",
    "a potential source of contamination in a sample of microlensing events can be blue bumpers and supernovae .",
    "both these classes are characterised by similar light curves to that of microlensing , especially if a light curve is of low photometric quality or sparsely sampled .",
    "blue bumpers can be effectively removed by using cut 2 , as they occupy the bright blue end of the main sequence . also blue bumpers are known to exhibit several bumps on a time - scale of a few years .",
    "this is why we make use of the ogle - iii data , giving us a full span of @xmath55 years , to understand the nature of each microlensing event candidate .",
    "the contamination with supernovae in the ogle  ii is very limited due to the fact that we observed a very small central region of the smc .",
    "there should be statistically 1 ( 4 ) sne peaking above @xmath56 ( 21 ) mag in our data . in cut 5",
    ", we compare the goodness of fit of the microlensing and supernova models , removing @xmath57 light curves with an asymmetric bump .",
    "our search pipeline has returned two microlensing event candidates . the close inspection of their positions , however , revealed they are separated from each other by 2 pixels ( @xmath58 arcsec ) only .",
    "moreover , the moment of the maximum brightness was exactly the same in both light curves .",
    "table [ tab : objects ] presents detailed information regarding both objects , including their positions and magnitudes .",
    "the probability for two independent microlensing events occurring at the same moment of time in such proximity is close to zero .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that both these events are the image of the same single microlensing event into two nearby stars .    to pinpoint the unbiased position of the event we employed dia .",
    "since the template image is matched astrometrically and photometrically to each image in a series , what is left on subtracted images are only variable objects ( with either positive or negative fluxes ) and systematic problems .",
    "all constant objects are subtracted out .",
    "[ fig : astrometry ] shows astrometric measurements of the centroid of the differential flux at various stages of the event ( indicated with different colours ) .",
    "it is evident that the most amplified data points from the peak of the event ( also with the most accurate astrometry ) are concentrated away from the centroids of both `` ghost '' microlensing events ( marked with a plus and a star ) .",
    "this indicates that the microlensed flux is not linked with neither of these objects and there must be yet another star hidden in the wings of the brighter object .",
    "this object is not present on the template .",

    "as expected the dia reduction lowered the amount of noise , as compared to the original macho reduction , clearly revealing a periodic variability in the baseline . with the period of 369 days ( close to 1 year ) this could be some kind of artefact , such as differential refraction .",

    "a simple microlensing event can be successfully described with five parameters ( eqns 2 and 3 ) .",
    "our first fit was done to the ogle @xmath43-band data solely , with the blending parameter @xmath24 fixed to 1 , meaning that we assume that all the light comes from the microlensed source only and there are no other sources of light contributing to the overall flux .",
    "such a four - parameter fit almost always converges and returns good first guess parameters for the five - parameter fit .",
    "next , we free the blending parameter and fit the light curve to obtain almost identical goodness - of - fit values as those returned by the four - parameter fit .",
    "the derived blending indicates that only 9 per cent of the light comes from the source .",
    "such a drop from 100 to 9 per cent for the blending parameter , and basically identical goodness of the fit , gives an overall impression of the low quality of the light curve .",
    "to improve the situation we performed a simultaneous fit to the ogle @xmath43-band and macho @xmath83-band data .",
    "since microlensing is achromatic , the parameters describing the geometry of the event ( @xmath87 ) stay the same for each data set .",
    "the model has only two additional parameters for an additional set of data : the blending parameter and baseline magnitude . in this model",
    "we also included the variability component to accommodate the variations present in the macho data , approximating their shape with 2 harmonics with period of @xmath88 days and @xmath89 for the epoch of the minimum .",
    "such a seven - parameter fit gives the best constraints for the parameters .",
    "the @xmath77 of this fit is the smallest from all three fits .    from the seven - parameter fit we obtained the colour and brightness of the source , and their formal errors as follows : @xmath90 mag and @xmath91 mag .",
    "note that the error - bar on the magnitude of the source is much smaller than calculated from the values and error - bars for the fitted parameters .",
    "this can be achieved because blending parameters of the fit are highly correlated .",
    "the microlensing model fit to the transformed @xmath44-band data , including the baseline s variability , is also shown in fig .",

    "the fit to the baseline ( fig .",
    "[ fig : event ] ) seems reasonable . however , noise in the data can hide some irregularities of the periodicity .",
    "if the above assumption is not valid , namely , that the baseline variability is invariant throughout the event , there is no other way of removing the variability , and thus the colour of the source can not be derived correctly .    *",

    "the position of ogle - smc-01 indicates it lies on the edge of the region we have excluded in our microlensing candidate search pipeline due to possible contamination of `` blue bumpers '' .",
    "it means , if it was indeed a microlensing event and was not blended with any other star , it would have been rejected by our search pipeline . on the other hand , the colour and magnitude of the source",
    "were derived because the microlensing fit indicated that severe blending was present in both bands . if this event is not due to microlensing , we do not have any other means to de - blend the observed fluxes , thus the real cmd position of the source star in that scenario remains unknown .",
    "high - resolution imaging might help in disentangling the true nature of the source star , however , proximity of 15.3 magnitude star could be a serious obstacle .",
    "the accumulation of problems related with this event ( blending with a very bright star , artefactual variability in the macho data , etc . ) , may cast some doubts on the reliability of the colour and brightness derived for the source star .",
    "also , the derived colour relies strongly on the accuracy of the model of the variability and its predictability during the event .",
    "therefore , with the available information , we are unable to conclude firmly whether the event is caused by microlensing and where its source star lies .",
    "* _ location of the blend_*. + another interesting thing to notice is the location of the blend object , as it lies in the not very populated region of the cmd .",
    "a plausible explanation for this could be that the bright star does not belong to the smc and is located in the foreground , e.g.,a main - sequence star at a distance between 1 and 6 kpc .",
    "another reason for this somewhat unusual location could be that apart from the lensed source , which is bluer , there is another blue component present in the blend and the bright star itself is an smc red giant .      during ogle ",
    "ii observations of the smc two other events happened , which were detected by the macho group and also reported by the eros collaboration .",
    "the peak of the event macho-97-smc-1 @xcite occurred well before the ogle ",

    "iii data for this star , there is no other `` outburst '' visible . lack of secondary deviations over many years and the presence of parallax effects in its light curve @xcite confirms this is a genuine microlensing event , despite it being located in the `` blue bumper '' region on the cmd ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "the next event detected a year later , macho-98-smc-1 , aka eros2-smc-1 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , was an obvious caustic - crossing binary lens event , which was observed by many groups and analysed thoroughly ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "however , the source star of this event was too faint to be detected on the ogle ",

    "in this study we applied the same technique as in paper i to deal with blending in the smc fields . in the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) archive we identified two images taken in the f814w filter ( the closest to ogle s @xmath43 band ) with exposure times longer than 10 minutes , located in the dense and sparse parts of the smc .",
    "then , for each of the images we cross - matched all stars with visible objects on the corresponding ogle image .",
    "this allowed us to derive mean blending distributions for dense and sparse fields and the distribution of the number of stars in each ogle object .",

    "however , the blending is still present at some small level and affects the way we see the smc with ogle instruments .",
    "similarly , as in paper i , we estimated the real number of monitored stars in the smc fields using the distribution of the number of stars in a single ogle object .",
    "the observed ogle luminosity function was convolved with the blending distribution and total number of stars was calculated .",
    "the estimated numbers of monitored stars in each field are provided in table [ tab : fields ] . on average , the correction factor for dense fields was about 1.9 and for sparse fields about 1.7 .",
    "the total number of monitored stars was estimated to be about 3.6 million , compared to about 2.1 million objects detected on the ogle ",
    "ii template images in cut 0 .",
    "derived blending distributions were then used in deriving a detection efficiency for microlensing events .",
    "details of the simulations and the method are provided in paper i. the efficiency of event detection was obtained for each smc field separately for time scales ranging from 1 to 1000 days . because our search algorithm was not sensitive to binary lens events and other exotic events , the efficiencies were additionally corrected by a factor of 0.9 to compensate for an estimated fraction of around 10 per cent of all events being non - single .    apart from the all stars sample ( with the magnitude cut as in the cut 0 . ) , the efficiencies were also derived for the bright sample of stars , defined as in paper i , i.e.,1 mag below the centre of the red clump ( usually around 19.5 mag ) .",
    "[ fig : eff ] shows an efficiency curve for the sparse field smc_sc7 ( the one with ogle - smc-01 ) for all and bright stars samples , with and without blending taken into account .",
    "efficiencies for the remaining fields varied within around 25 per cent from these curves , depending on the density level and the time span of observations . as expected , the detection efficiency for bright sources is significantly higher than that for all sources .",
    "there is also a strong dependence on taking blending into account .",
    "if blending is neglected , the efficiency rises by approximatively 60 per cent , but the number of monitored stars is then the same as the number of objects visible on the template .",
    "however , the smaller number of monitored stars ( 2.1 million compared to 3.6 million after correcting for blending , i.e.,70 per cent drop ) does not fully compensate the rise in the detection efficiency .",
    "this agrees with our conclusions from paper i that blending should be scrupulously taken into account when measuring the microlensing optical depth .",

    "the search for microlensing events in the ogle  ii data towards the smc yielded a discovery of a single , rather weak candidate event .",

    "_ variable star scenario_*. + the first scenario is that the event is some kind of a variable star with an occasional outburst .",
    "astrometry of the observed additional flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig : astrometry ] ) indicates that the source of the outburst was severely blended with surrounding stars and was located in the wings of the bright star .",
    "therefore it was impossible to derive its real magnitude and colour and , by placing it on the cmd , to link the event to any of known outburst - like variables .",
    "judging just from the symmetric shape of the light curve it could be a `` blue bumper '' as these are known to resemble microlensing events @xcite . on the other hand , the bumpers tend to repeat their outbursts after several years ( e.g.,@xcite ) , which we do not see in the available data .",
    "the baseline of the event observed by ogle  ii and ogle  iii remained constant for over 11 years .",
    "the periodic variability present in the macho data was not observed in any other data sets and its period close to 1 year indicates it must be some sort of observational artefact .",
    "apart from that , macho data do not show any other additional outbursts , so when combined with ogle data the event remains singular for more than 15 years of continuous observations .",
    "* _ microlensing scenario_*. + the microlensing scenario has also its weaknesses . because of the severe blending with a bright star , the deviation in the light curve is rather small ( @xmath112 mag ) .",
    "nevertheless , fitting to both ogle and macho data ( seven - parameter microlensing model ) resulted in the source s brightness and colour being derived and the source s location placed on the cmd ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "the fact that the source lies in a sparsely populated region of the diagram between the main sequence branch and red clump suggests the source could be rather nearby , located in the foreground halo or the disk of our galaxy .",
    "however , lensing in such case is extremely unlikely , as its optical depth is of order of @xmath113 ( e.g.,@xcite ) , i.e.,2 orders of magnitude smaller than that for self - lensing of the smc . on the other hand",
    ", the source could be a binary in the smc , with components of different colours blended and close enough for the microlensing not to resolve them , as no binary - source features are present in the light - curve .",
    "moreover , if the lensed source was located at the far end of the smc it would suffer from high internal extinction , thus its position on the cmd would move from the main sequence towards the less populated region .",
    "the central location of the event on the smc map coincides with the region where smc is the thickest . however , the internal extinction derived by @xcite for the region of the ogle - smc-01 was @xmath114 mag , far too small to explain the unusual position of the source .",
    "on the other hand , the authors notice that their estimate for the extinction could be underestimated as the extinction in the case of the lmc , derived using main sequence ob stars as tracers @xcite , differs by about 0.2 mag .",
    "this could indicate some significant differences in the spatial distributions of different tracers within the magellanic clouds .",
    "given the source , if reddened , belongs to the o , b or a main sequence stars , the internal extinction could reach up to @xmath115 mag .",
    "that would be consistent with the source being located in the far end of the cloud and self - lensed by an object from within the smc .",
    "self - lensing events were already suggested to suffer from higher extinction in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , both other known smc events from the period of the ogle  ii , namely macho-97-smc-1 and macho-98-smc-1 , were considered as caused by self - lensing ( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the self - lensing optical depth of the smc was estimated by @xcite in the n - body simulations of the smc events .",
    "they concluded the self - lensing contribution to the overall @xmath96 over the eros-2 fields was @xmath116 , with a maximum value at the very centre of the smc of @xmath117 .",
    "these estimates , however , were based on rather small line - of - sight depth of the smc ( about 2kpc ) and are probably underestimated in view of recent results from @xcite , who derived the depth of the smc bar to about 5kpc . moreover , because ogle  ii covers only the very central parts of the smc , it is more prone to see self - lensing events than eros , which covered a much larger area .",
    "the long time - scale of the ogle - smc-01 event is also in agreement with the expected time - scale for self - lensing events of about 100 days for a mean lens mass of 0.35 @xmath2 .",
    "the time - scale of the event is also similar to those of both macho events , suspected to be due to self - lensing .",
    "therefore , we are inclined to conclude that the most likely scenario for the ogle - smc-01 event is the self - lensing in the smc",
    ".      values of the optical depth derived for different time - scales of the event , obtained using either ogle data or a combination of ogle and macho data , vary in range between 1.4 and 1.9 @xmath14 .",
    "they agree with estimates for self - lensing from @xcite for the central parts of the smc , but their statistical significance is very difficult to judge because of just one contributing event .",
    "they are , however , still in agreement with eros s calculation for the sole event macho-97-smc-1 , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "based on their two events , the macho collaboration estimated @xmath118 @xcite , which , again , is in agreement with our result .",
    "yet , we must emphasise that the value of the optical depth obtained just for one single event is statistically not very significant .",
    "if converted to a fraction of machos in the galactic halo it would mean that between 25 and 40 per cent of halo s mass is contained in dark matter compact objects .",
    "nonetheless , that would be valid only when the event we found was assumed to be caused by macho lensing and the modelled optical depth was @xmath119 for a galaxy halo entirely constructed of machos , according to model @xmath120 of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if we speculate that all three events detected by ogle  ii towards both magellanic clouds were due to the machos , that would mean that machos compose about 15 per cent of the total mass of the galactic halo with mean mass of 0.7 @xmath2 .",
    "this is shown as a box in fig .",
    "[ fig : upperlimit ] .        on the other hand , if all three events detected towards the smc and lmc were caused by the regular luminous stellar component of each cloud ( self  lensing )",
    ", there is a nil result for candidates for the macho lensing among 15 million monitored stars from both clouds . that could be translated into an upper limit for macho fraction in the halo using our detection efficiency and time - scale distribution for halo lenses from the model @xmath120 .",
    "we took the mean observing time ( both clouds were observed for the nearly the same time ) and we used mean detection efficiencies to derive the total number of expected events in lmc and smc . the efficiency and number of monitored stars in the smc",
    "were adjusted to be consistent with the magnitude cut applied in the lmc study ( 20.4 mag ) .",
    "we estimated the number of events expected to be observed by ogle  ii in the smc and lmc as caused by macho lenses only . following the suggestion of @xcite",
    ", we assumed all 3 detected events are the expected self - lensing signal ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) and used poisson statistics tables for such a background from @xcite .",
    "for a `` typical '' macho mass of 0.4 @xmath2 we expect at least 19 events , which gives a limit of 27 per cent of the total halo mass at 95 per cent confidence .",
    "however , if , based on its ambiguity , we reject the ogle - smc-01 as not a genuine microlensing event , there are only 2 events in both clouds .",
    "the exact value of the background ( i.e.,self - lensing and other - than - macho lensing events ) is not well known towards the smc . because , however , events detected by macho in the 1997 and 1998 were confirmed in having a self - lensing nature , here we assume there should be at least one self - lensing event expected . for @xmath122 and @xmath123",
    "the upper limit on macho fraction in the halo becomes about 20 per cent for deflector mass of 0.4 @xmath2 and 11 per cent for masses in range 0.003 and 0.2 @xmath2 , at the 95 per cent confidence level .",
    "the upper limit on the macho mass fraction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : upperlimit ] .",
    "ogle  ii has provided a new and independent constraint on the presence of compact dark matter objects in the galactic halo . in the lmc",
    "there were 2 candidate events found , both most likely due to self - lensing .",
    "a single candidate event was detected in the smc data and its presence , if of microlensing nature at all , is consistent with the self - lensing scenario , in which the source is located at the far back end of the smc and was lensed by a lens from within the smc .",
    "the unusual position of the source on the colour - magnitude diagram could also be explained by , e.g.,binarity of the source , and is generally not very trustworthy due to numerous ambiguities of the data .",
    "the derived optical depth estimate for the single event indicates a value of @xmath124 , which is very close to the previous measurements obtained with other data sets by the eros and macho collaborations and is in agreement with self - lensing estimates .",
    "however , its low statistical significance prevents deriving any reasonable conclusions on its origin , which may require further and more detailed studies of the structure of the smc and resulting self - lensing optical depth .",
    "the detection of a single and unconvincing candidate event in the ogle  ii smc data only strengthen our previous conclusions reached in the ogle  ii lmc data ( paper i ) .",
    "the hypothesis that the galactic halo is composed of compact objects is not favoured by these results .",
    "they show that the fraction of compact objects is close to zero and the only reason why we can not completely exclude the compact - object hypothesis is due to limitations of the survey .",
