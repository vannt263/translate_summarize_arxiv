    "the chemistry of pdrs is nowadays the subject of an important amount of observational and theoretical works .",
    "the reactive ions are among the best tracers of pdrs , because their abundances are expected to be negligible in the shielded parts of molecular clouds .",
    "actually , these compounds react on virtually every collision with h@xmath4 and only in the hot layers of pdrs , where a significant fraction of hydrogen is still in atomic form , does the abundance of these ions become significant ( sternberg & dalgarno 1995 ) .",
    "recently , our group has carried out a survey of reactive ions ( co@xmath0 , hoc@xmath0 , so@xmath0 ) towards the prototypical pdr regions ngc 7023 , the orion bar and the planetary nebula ngc 7027 ( fuente et al .",
    "our results confirm that the abundance of reactive ions is strongly enhanced in pdrs , although strong differences may exist among pdrs depending on their physical and chemical conditions .",
    "so far , all the observational knowledge about reactive ions in pdrs are based on a few sources .",
    "very little is known about the chemistry of the pdrs associated to ultracompact ( uc )  regions . the high densities ( @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 ) and kinetic temperatures ( @xmath8 100 k ) of these regions , together with the ionizing radiation ( g@xmath9 in units of habing field ) , could drive a chemistry presumably different from that found in other pdrs . in this paper",
    "we present the detection of co@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 towards the s mon r2 and g29.96 - 0.02 .",
    "these are the first detections of co@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 in this kind of regions and prove the feasibility of chemical studies of the pdrs associated with s , even at large distances , as in the case of g29.96 - 0.02  ( 6 or 9 kpc , pratap et al .",
    "we have carried out a survey of the reactive ions co@xmath0  and hoc@xmath0  towards the pdrs associated to the s mon r2 and g29.96 - 0.02 . besides co@xmath0   and hoc@xmath0 , we have also observed some rotational transitions of sio , h@xmath10co@xmath0 and hc@xmath11o@xmath0 .",
    "the observations were carried out using the iram 30 m radio telescope in pico de veleta ( spain ) during july 2002 .",
    "the observed transitions , their frequencies and the telescope parameters are shown in table 1 .",
    "mon r2 , located at a distance of 950 pc , is the closest and has an angular diameter of @xmath8 22@xmath12 ( 0.1 pc ) .",
    "it is comparable to the beam of the 30 m radio telescope at 3 mm , which allows us to spatially separate the  and the surrounding molecular cloud .",
    "the situation is clearly illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "in the left panel , the cs 7@xmath136 emission map from choi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is shown .",
    "the central square roughly indicates the angular extension of the  at 6cm - continuum ( wood & churchwell 1989 ) .",
    "the beamsize both at 3 mm and 1 mm are also sketched .",
    "the cs emission shows an arc - like structure surrounding the  region , with the maximum of emission to the southeast .",
    "the  is highly asymmetric and has a cometary shape , reaching its maximum toward its exciting star mon r2 irs1 , which is also the origin of angular offsets .",
    "we have performed the observations towards this maximum of the ionized gas , at ( 0 , 0 ) , and toward the peak of cs emission , at ( 10 , -10 ) . some of the observed spectra at both positions are shown in the right panel of fig .  1 . while the hc@xmath11o@xmath0 emission is more intense in the molecular cloud than in the  region position , the reactive ions co@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 have only been detected towards the .",
    "both co@xmath0 lines have been detected towards the , and fulfill the line ratio of 0.55 expected for optically thin emission .",
    "the parameters of the gaussian fits to all the observed lines at the two positions in mon r2 ( and also the single position in g29.96 - 0.02 ) are shown in table 2 .",
    "the h@xmath10co@xmath0 and hc@xmath11o@xmath0 lines seem to mimic the cs j = 7@xmath136 line emission a well known tracer of high density gas , because both lines are enhanced in the molecular cloud with respect to the  region .",
    "this enhancement is indeed a lower limit , because these lines were observed with a 29  beam .",
    "however , the behaviour of co@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 is the opposite . since the dipole moments of both ions are similar to that of hc@xmath11o@xmath0 and h@xmath10co@xmath0 , this effect may not be due to an excitation effect .",
    "actually , the detection of these ions towards the ionized region and the lack of detection towards the molecular envelope can only be understood if the abundances of co@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 are strongly enhanced toward the position of the  relative to those in the molecular cloud .",
    "very likely , the emitting region of these ions would be the pdr associated to mon r2 .",
    "the situation in g29.96 - 0.02  is more complex than in mon r2 . besides a surrounding massive molecular envelope",
    ", there is also a hot core at 2  from the center of the .",
    "so far , our single - dish observations were done toward a single position which includes , even at 1 mm , contributions from the , the molecular envelope and the hot core .",
    "the positions of g29.96 - 0.02  and its neighbour hot core , as well as the relevant spectra observed in this paper , are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "both the hot core and the dense envelope associated with this source have been extensively observed in molecular lines ( see e.g.  cesaroni et al .",
    "1998 ; maxia et al .",
    "fortunately , we can identify and separate the emission of the hot core by kinematics considerations . while the lines arising in the hot core should have linewidths @xmath8 1520 , the lines arising in the molecular cloud and/or pdr should have linewidhts @xmath8 35 . in fig .  2 ( lower left panel ) , the sio 3@xmath132 and sio 2@xmath131 spectra are shown .",
    "we see that these spectra have a narrow and a wide components .",
    "while the narrow component arises from the  and the molecular environment , the wide component arises from the hot core .",
    "figure 2 ( right panel ) shows the hc@xmath11o@xmath0 , co@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 spectra observed in g29.96 - 0.02 .",
    "the co@xmath0  lines does not fulfill the standard ratio of 0.55 , because of the blending of the 2,5/2@xmath131,3/2 line by two hyperfine components of @xmath10ch@xmath14oh , which is expected to be abundant in the hot core and the molecular cloud .",
    "the contamination was confirmed by the broad bandwidth ( 256 @xmath15 1 mhz - filterbank ) spectrum , which shows the `` forest '' of @xmath10ch@xmath14oh , ch@xmath14cho and hco@xmath4ch@xmath14 lines ( blake et al .",
    "1984 ) . in order to avoid contamination with the @xmath10ch@xmath14oh lines",
    ", we have used the co@xmath0 2,3/2 @xmath13 1,1/2 line for our column density estimates .",
    "both the co@xmath0 line and the hoc@xmath0 line are narrow ( up to a few ) and hence they are not originated in the hot core .",
    "specially striking is the double - peaked structure of the 2,3/2@xmath131,1/2 line .",
    "the main peak , at @xmath8 98.0 , has the velocity of the , while the secondary peak , at @xmath8 101.3 , is clearly redshifted .",
    "it is worth noting that there is hco@xmath0 emission also at this redshifted velocity ( maxia et al .",
    "2001 ) , as well as a weak emission in our hc@xmath11o@xmath0 spectra . as discussed by maxia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the hco@xmath0 emission is associated to the .",
    "the simplest explanation for the redshifted component is that we are seeing a thin layer of dense gas in the receding face of the .",
    "the fact that both co@xmath0 peaks are similar in intensity , while the main part of the hc@xmath11o@xmath0 spectrum is @xmath8 10 times larger than the redshifted part , implies that the co@xmath0 abundance would be @xmath8 10 times larger in the receding layer with respect to the 98  gas .",
    "this shows that the chemistry of this receding layer is being dominated by uv radiation from the .",
    "we are very likely seeing the innermost layer of molecular gas which is being accelerated by the ionized gas .",
    "we have used the sio j = @xmath16 and @xmath17 lines to estimate the hydrogen densities in these regions . using a lvg code and assuming for both sources the kinetic temperature ( t@xmath18 ) of mon r2 ( 50 k , giannakopoulou et al .",
    "1997 ) , we have derived hydrogen densities , @xmath19 , of 1.5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 for the ( 0,0 ) position of mon r2 , and 1.0 10@xmath6 @xmath7 and 7.0 10@xmath20 @xmath7 for the wide and narrow component of the emission towards g29.96 - 0.02 .",
    "these estimates are in reasonable agreement with other species already observed , as referred above .",
    "the h@xmath10co@xmath0 column density has been determined using the lvg code and t@xmath18 = 50 k and @xmath19 = 10@xmath6 @xmath7 . with these assumptions ,",
    "the h@xmath10co@xmath0 rotation temperature is @xmath8 20 k. since the dipole moments of the observed reactive ions are similar to that of h@xmath10co@xmath0 we have derived the co@xmath0 , hoc@xmath0 and hc@xmath11o@xmath0 column densities assuming optically thin emission and using the lte approximation with a rotation temperature of 20 k. in table 3 , we show the column densities derived in this way for the two positions observed in mon r2 and for the narrow and wide component in g29.96 - 0.02 .    several arguments support",
    "the reactive ions co@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 arising in the pdrs linked to these s. to start with , a significant variation in the co@xmath0 abundance can be found between the molecular peak and the  in mon r2 ( see table  3 ) .",
    "the [ co@xmath0]/[hc@xmath11o@xmath0 ] ratio is at least a factor of 6 larger towards the   than towards the molecular cloud . assuming a uniform hc@xmath11o@xmath0 abundance",
    ", this means that the co@xmath0 abundance is at least a factor of 6 larger in the than in the surrounding molecular cloud .",
    "like co@xmath0 , the reactive ion hoc@xmath0 has only been detected towards the  in mon r2 .",
    "assuming @xmath21o/@xmath11o @xmath8 650 , we have measured [ hco@xmath0]/[hoc@xmath0 ] @xmath8 460 in mon r2 .",
    "this value is similar to that found in the orion bar but significantly lower than the values found by apponi & ziurys ( 1997 ) in a sample of star forming regions .",
    "the co@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 column densities are similar in both objects .",
    "this is quite surprising taking into account that the column densities of the other molecules ( h@xmath10co@xmath0 , hc@xmath11o@xmath0 and sio ) are at least one order of magnitude larger in g29.96 - 0.02  than in mon r2 .",
    "it may be explained if co@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 arise in the pdr while the other species are well spread in the whole molecular cloud .",
    "actually , this is an indirect prove of the link of the reactive ions co@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 with the .",
    "the observation of reactive ions in regions with a wide range of physical conditions is necessary to disclose between the different chemical processes involved in the chemistry of reactive ions . thus far ,",
    "most of the studied pdrs have low densities , @xmath19 @xmath22 10@xmath20 @xmath7 , and incident uv fields , g@xmath23 @xmath22 10@xmath20 .",
    "there is a lack of data on regions of high densities and ionizing radiation .",
    "mon r2 and g29.96 - 0.02are the first targets where the reactive ions co@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 can be studied in such conditions .",
    "we have estimated the incident uv field by assuming that the observed fir emission ( l@xmath24 ) represents all the stellar flux .",
    "then a black body radiation law at the exciting star s effective temperature ( t@xmath25 ) is assumed to estimate the fraction of the luminosity radiated in the uv range . adopting values for t@xmath25 , l@xmath24 and distance to the star of 24000 k , 3000 l@xmath26 and 0.03 pc for mon r2 ( henning et al .",
    "1992 ) , and 35000 k , 45000 l@xmath26 and 0.2 pc for g29.96 - 0.02  ( morisset et al .",
    "2002 ; martin - hernndez et al .",
    "2003 ) , we have obtained g@xmath27 for mon r2 and g@xmath28 for g29.96 - 0.02 .",
    "these values comparable to that of the star - forming region w49n ( vastel et al .",
    "2001 ) and are significantly larger than the values of g@xmath23 in the prototypical and best studied pdrs .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the co@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 column densities derived in this paper and in fuente et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , as a function of the incident uv field .",
    "error bars represent the source - averaged and beam - averaged limits , and hence do not take into account other sources of uncertainty .",
    "the beam filling factor was computed by taking into account the angular extension of each pdr .",
    "the assumed sizes are : a filament of 6@xmath12 of thickness in ngc 7023 ( fuente et al .",
    "1996 ) ; half of the beam in the case of the orion bar since the ( 0@xmath12 , 0@xmath12 ) position is at the edge of the molecular bar ( fuente et al .  2003 ) ; 13@xmath12 in ngc 7027 ( cox et al .  1997 ) ; and the sizes of the radio continuum emission at 6 cm , 10@xmath12 and 8@xmath12 in mon r2 and g29.96 - 0.02respectively .",
    "mon r2 and g29.96 - 0.02  are at the upper end of the range of uv fields studied so far .",
    "a selection effect may be present in fig .  3 because the detection are only possible above a certain column density ( approximately the upper limit of hoc@xmath0  in ngc 7027 ) .",
    "even so , when detected , the column densities remain of the same order in a variety of objects , which is graphically shown in the large range of g@xmath23 in fig .  3 .",
    "although the uv fields are spread over two orders of magnitude , the co@xmath0 column densities measured towards mon r2 and g29.96 - 0.02  are closely similar , within a factor of 2 , to those observed in the orion bar and ngc 7023 .",
    "this would imply that the total co@xmath0 column density in a pdr remain roughly constant for a wide range of global physical conditions ( @xmath19 from 10@xmath20 @xmath7 to @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 ) and uv radiation fields ( g@xmath23 from 10@xmath29 to @xmath30 ) .",
    "only the c - rich planetary nebula ngc 7027 seems rather different from the rest of sources .",
    "a similar behavior is found for hoc@xmath0 .",
    "the chemistry of co@xmath0 is still poorly known .",
    "several co@xmath0 formation mechanisms , including c@xmath0 + oh @xmath13 co@xmath0 + h , the charge transfer reaction between co and ch@xmath0 , and the direct ionization of co , have been proposed to explain the large co@xmath0  abundances observed .",
    "the almost constant co@xmath0 abundance argues in favour of the direct photoionization of co is not a significant formation mechanism for co@xmath0 ( fuente & martin - pintado  1997 ) .",
    "models in which only the c@xmath0 + oh and ch@xmath0 + co reactions are included ( sternberg & dalgarno 1995 ; hasegawa et al .  2000 )",
    "accounts reasonably well for the co@xmath0 column densities plotted in fig .",
    "on the other hand , hoc@xmath0 is efficiently formed in a pdr _ via _ the reaction c@xmath0 + h@xmath4o @xmath13 hoc@xmath0/hco@xmath0 + h , and co@xmath0 + h@xmath4 @xmath13 hoc@xmath0/hco@xmath0 + h , but it is rapidly destroyed by the isomerization reaction with h@xmath4 ( smith et al .",
    "the low values of [ hco@xmath0]/[hoc@xmath0 ] observed in pdrs can only be explained by a very rapid loss of the isomer hco@xmath0 by electronic recombination in regions with high electron density .",
    "there is no detection of hoc@xmath0 in ngc 7027 , which is quite surprising regarding the large co@xmath0 column density measured in this source .",
    "one possible explanation is that the bulk of the hoc@xmath0 and hco@xmath0 in pdrs are formed by the reaction c@xmath0 + h@xmath4o in a region where the co@xmath0 is not abundant .",
    "this path is reinforced by the low abundance of water in ngc 7027 ( liu et al .",
    "1996 ) . in order to disentangle among the different processes , detailed chemical models and interferometric observations which will trace the relative positions of the co@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 layers are required .",
