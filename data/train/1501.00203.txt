    "small cells as part of the second tier in multi - tiered cellular networks have been considered as an effective means to boost the capacity and expand the coverage .",
    "two types of small cells are widely used .",
    "one is the femtocell which shares the cellular licensed band with macrocells @xcite .",
    "the other type is the wifi hotspot that is built by cellular operators to offload traffic from their licensed bands to the unlicensed band .",
    "[ table : specuse ] shows the spectrum map of these two approaches in cases 1 and 2 , respectively .        in this paper",
    ", we use the terminology  device \" to refer to the end - user terminal in long term evolution ( lte ) and wifi communications , which is referred to as the user equipment ( ue ) in 3rd generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) terminology and the  station \" in ieee 802.11 wifi terminology . today many  smart \" devices such as smartphones , tablets and ipads are equipped with both wifi and cellular interfaces . in order to improve the data rate of such smart devices ( sdevices ) , the small cell forum proposed the integrated femto - wifi ( ifw ) @xcite which can simultaneously communicate in both the licensed band ( via cellular interface ) and the unlicensed band ( via wifi interface ) with sdevices .",
    "the ifw spectrum usage is shown in case 3 of fig .",
    "[ table : specuse ] .",
    "an alternative way of simultaneously using both the licensed and unlicensed bands is investigated in our earlier study @xcite which proposes that femto cells can use lte technology in both licensed and unlicensed bands through the lte carrier aggregation feature @xcite , resulting in the dual - band femtocell ( dbf ) in case 4 of fig . [",
    "table : specuse ] . in september 2014",
    ", the 3gpp approved the industry proposal @xcite to start standardizing the  licensed - assisted access using lte \" which is also often referred to as lte - unlicensed , lte - u and u - lte .",
    "the main idea of lte - u is the same as the dbf framework in this paper .",
    "since the unlicensed spectrum is shared by many cellular operators and non - cellular devices , how to access the unlicensed band and how to share the unlicensed band with other devices is essential to the dbf user experience .",
    "however , these issues have not been addressed in @xcite and may be an important part of the standardization effort .",
    "short - range data communications arising in small cells typically contain different types of devices .",
    "one type is the sdevice which is equipped with both wifi and cellular interfaces as discussed above .",
    "we consider lte as the cellular radio access technology ( rat ) in this paper in order to use the lte carrier aggregation feature for dbf .",
    "another type is the wifi - only device ( wdevice ) such as tv , desktop computer , wireless printer and video surveillance camera , which is typically equipped with wifi but no cellular interface .",
    "cellular - only devices are not considered , as the most recent cellular devices typically have a wifi interface .",
    "in addition , a single user may use multiple devices at the same time .",
    "for example , in a residential scenario , a user may be watching video clips on her tablet jointly over the wifi and cellular interfaces ( using ifw or dbf ) , while her wireless video surveillance camera continuously transfers live video to the wifi access point ( ap ) .",
    "therefore , a user s satisfaction can come from the overall experience from multiple sdevices and wdevices . in cases 1 and 3",
    ", the small cell ( wifi hotspot and ifw ) can serve both sdevices and wdevices .",
    "however , in cases 2 and 4 , the cellular small cell itself ( femto cell and dbf respectively ) can not serve wdevices , hence we assume the femto cell and dbf are deployed with non - cellular wireless local area network ( wlan ) aps which are not physically integrated with the femto or dbf base station ( bs ) in the same box .",
    "the four use cases are summarized in fig .",
    "[ table:4usecases ] . in the figure and throughout this paper ,",
    "we denote macro bs and device by mbs and mdevice , respectively , and small cell ( of cases 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) bs as fbs .    in this study",
    ", the  small cell \" mainly refers to the cell for short - range communications in residential and enterprise scenarios , as shown in the four use cases in fig .",
    "[ table:4usecases ] ;  macro cell \" refers to pico , micro or macro cells .",
    "in addition , the  wifi \" refers to the air interface defined by the ieee 802.11 standards ; the  wifi hotspot \" only refers to the cellular small cell in case 1 ; the  wlan \" only refers to the non - cellular networks used by the wdevices in case 2 and 4 .",
    "the focus of this paper is on the cases 3 and 4 which is defined in fig . [ table:4usecases ] and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : coexistence - scenario ] . the contribution can be summarized as follows .    * in order for dbf to use the lte air interface in the unlicensed band , we propose a channel access scheme that aligns with the lte frame structure .",
    "once the channel is obtained , the dbf will follow the standard lte air interface in the unlicensed band .",
    "* we propose a dynamic traffic balancing algorithm over licensed and unlicensed bands for ifw and dbf that aims at optimizing the overall _ user experience _ from multiple sdevices and wdevices in short range communications .",
    "the algorithm is based on the real - time channel , interference and traffic conditions of both bands .",
    "we formulate and solve for the optimal downlink traffic balancing scheme in order to maximize the user utility ( satisfaction ) from all sdevices and wdevices belonging to the same user while controlling the interference leaked from the small cell to the macrocell .",
    "* the utility maximization described in the previous bullet is achieved by small cell power control in the licensed band and channel time allocation in the unlicensed band .",
    "once the optimal channel time usage in the unlicensed band is determined , the small cell tunes its channel access parameters to achieve the allocated channel time .",
    "the process of tuning channel access parameters depends on the rat used in the unlicensed band .",
    "we study how the channel access parameters can be tuned for the ifw , which uses the wifi air interface , and for the dbf , which uses the lte air interface in the unlicensed band , respectively .",
    "* we provide extensive system simulations that show that the proposed traffic balancing algorithm significantly improves user satisfaction for ifw and dbf , compared with the current practice where devices typically have to choose only one band ( licensed or unlicensed ) to use at a time , as in cases 1 and 2 of fig . [",
    "table : specuse ] .",
    "this paper extends our earlier dbf traffic balancing algorithm @xcite by considering multiple non - cellular wlan devices , incorporating the ifw scenario , and introducing a new use case where a single user may use multiple devices .",
    "both this paper and @xcite are based on the channel access scheme proposed in our earlier study @xcite .",
    "this work is related to @xcite which proposes that lte small cells use the licensed - exempt tv whitespace band .",
    "it is proposed in @xcite that lte small cells use frequency - hopping and time - hopping in the tv whitespace band to reduce interference from other devices in the band ; whereas this study proposes a channel - sensing based channel access scheme for lte small cells to access the band and reduce interference , which may also be applicable to the new study item ( si )  licensed - assisted access using lte \" which was recently approved for 3gpp rel-13 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the existing literature on unlicensed band lte @xcite@xcite does not investigate the traffic balancing problem over the two bands .",
    "existing traffic balancing algorithms over licensed and unlicensed bands are mainly for ifw @xcite @xcite , but not for dbf . specifically , bennis et .",

    "[ sec : ch - access - scheme ] , we introduce a centralized channel access scheme for dbf to use the unlicensed band . in sec . [ sec : dl - assignment ] , we propose a traffic balancing algorithm for small cells to assign traffic over the licensed and unlicensed bands .",
    "the rat - dependent process of tuning channel access parameters is analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec_ifw ] for ifw and in sec .",
    "[ sec_dbf ] for dbf . in sec .",
    "[ sec : femto - system - simulations ] , we evaluate the proposed traffic balancing algorithm through system simulations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude the paper and compare ifw and dbf from an implementation standpoint .",
    "two types of small cells , the ifw @xcite introduced by the small cell forum and the dbf proposed in @xcite@xcite , that simultaneously access both licensed and unlicensed bands are considered in this paper .",
    "we consider closed access small cells that can only be accessed by registered devices @xcite . in the licensed band , the lte air interface @xcite , which divides the spectrum into radio blocks which are referred to as subchannels , is used . in the unlicensed band , different nodes share the air resource in time ,",
    "not frequency , so we do not consider subchannels .    throughout this paper ,  wifi hotspot ,",
    "\"  ifw \" and  dbf \" refer to both the fbs and all associated devices using the appropriate radio access technology . the term  wlan \" refers to the network formed by a wifi ap and wdevices that coexist with the sdevices in cases 2 and 4 ; while the term  wifi hotspot \" refers to the small cell in case 1 of fig . [ table : specuse ] that is used by both sdevices and wdevices .",
    "we assume that ifw and dbf bss conduct the traffic balancing over the licensed and unlicensed bands .",
    "how to allocate radio resources ( i.e. , power , frequency and time ) to individual _ devices within one cell _ in the licensed band is a complex problem @xcite , and is out of the scope of this paper where the focus is radio resource allocation _ among different types of cells _ including macrocell , small cell ( ifw or dbf ) and non - cellular wlan .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we only consider a single sdevice in the small cell ; the extension to the multi - device small cell case could be based on an analysis similar to this paper .",
    "in addition , we assume that the licensed band and unlicensed band use separate power budgets , due to different government regulation requirements for the bands .    in the ifw use case , we consider an ifw fbs and a mbs , where the ifw fbs is connected to one sdevice and @xmath0 wdevices and the mbs is serving @xmath1 mdevices .",
    "whereas in the dbf use case , we consider a dbf fbs , a wifi ap and a mbs , where the dbf fbs is connected to one sdevice , the wifi ap is connected to @xmath0 wdevices , and the mbs is serving @xmath1 mdevices .",
    "the wifi ap may or may not be physically integrated with the dbf fbs .",
    "we consider the case where the wifi wlan and dbf use the same unlicensed band carrier frequency , which is the worst case in terms of network performance . in either use case ,",
    "the sdevice and wdevices are used by a single user or a single group of users ( e.g. , a family , an enterprise or passengers on the same vehicle ) . in the unlicensed band ,",
    "the dbf fbs contends with @xmath0 wdevices for the channel .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 is much larger than one , and each contending node ( wdevice or dbf fbs ) can sense the other nodes .",
    "furthermore , the dbf fbs success probability for each access attempt in the unlicensed band is denoted as @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath3 ( the time interval between two channel access attempts from the dbf fbs ) is comparable to the transmission durations of the other unlicensed band devices , it is reasonable to assume that the fbs channel access attempts are statistically independent .",
    "we assume no external interference in the unlicensed band except the collisions among the transmitters in the ifw , dbf and wlan ; in case of collisions , we assume that wifi transmissions always fail , otherwise , transmission errors are neglected since the data rate is adapted to the instantaneous sinr @xcite .",
    "in addition , hidden terminal and exposed terminal problems can be detected by the dbf and ifw fbss via existing lte downlink channel quality indicator ( cqi ) feedbacks over the licensed band . in the unlicensed band ,",
    "if the fbs senses good channel quality while the cqi from the ue report is constantly below a threshold , the fbs may determine that the ue is under high interference from hidden terminals .",
    "similarly , if the fbs senses bad channel quality while the cqi from the ue report is constantly above a threshold , the fbs may determine that the fbs itself experiences exposed terminal problems .",
    "note that the detection of hidden and exposed terminals is difficult , if not impossible , when only one unlicensed carrier frequency is used ( e.g. , wifi , bluetooth ) .",
    "the fbs may take different approaches upon detecting the hidden terminals , e.g. , selecting another unlicensed carrier frequency to operate on , which is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "the lte air interface @xcite supports both frequency - division duplex ( fdd ) and time - division duplex ( tdd ) modes .",
    "we consider fdd - mode lte in this study .",
    "for ease of exposure , we only consider downlink transmissions for mdevices and sdevices , and assume that sdevices use the unlicensed band only for downlink transmissions in both ifw and dbf use cases ( uplink is in the licensed band ) .",
    "for the wdevices , we consider both downlink and uplink transmissions , since the downlink contends with uplink in a random fashion and can not be separately studied . in the unlicensed band ,",
    "the performance of the sdevices in both ifw and dbf use cases is dependent on the traffic load of the coexisting wdevices , which can be described by the parameter @xmath4 , the fraction of channel time needed to deliver the ul and dl traffic of all wdevices . in general , @xmath4 is determined by the average traffic load and data rate of every wdevice .",
    "note that the ul and dl data rates of a wdevice are the same due to channel reciprocity .",
    "we define a wdevice s throughput as the sum of uplink and downlink throughput . in order to identify the maximum capacity of the two - tiered cellular network",
    ", we assume that the mdevices and sdevices always have downlink traffic to receive ( i.e. , their traffic loads are more than their physical layers can support ) . in the licensed band , we assume that mbss do not adjust their transmission powers in the presence of small cell interference .",
    "both lte and wifi have multiple modulation and coding schemes ( mcss ) and adapt their mcss to the instantaneous signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratios ( sinrs ) . in practice ,",
    "the wifi rate function @xmath5 and lte rate function @xmath6 are dependent on their mcss and bandwidth . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the actual @xmath5 determined by the wifi standard @xcite .",
    "for ease of exposure , we will first conduct our analysis using shannon capacity as @xmath6 in section [ sec : opt_solution ] ; then in section [ subsec : traffic - assign - implementation ] , we will consider a closed - form approximation for the actual lte rate function .",
    "it is clear that the small cell unlicensed band rate function @xmath7 is equal to @xmath5 and @xmath6 in ifw and dbf , respectively .",
    "we assume that the fbs knows the received sinrs at the sdevice in both licensed and unlicensed bands via device feedback .",
    "more specifically , in the licensed band , the fbs controls the transmission power @xmath8 and knows the received sinr @xmath9 of sdevice in subchannel @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) . here in subchannel @xmath10 , @xmath12 is path loss of the desired signal divided by the interference and noise power .",
    "we also assume that the fbs knows the inter - cell interference channel gain @xmath13 ( @xmath11 ) from the fbs to the mdevice that uses subchannel @xmath10 in the licensed band .",
    "for simplicity , we do not consider fading , mobility or multi - antenna transceivers , which would mainly affect the required overhead for obtaining the sinrs and channel gains in our problem formulation .",
    "a utility function @xmath14 is used to evaluate user satisfaction about an achieved throughput @xmath15 .",
    "we will consider the widely - used logarithmic utility function to achieve proportional fairness @xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is natural logarithm function .",
    "the concavity of the logarithmic function well captures the typical user experience about throughput  as throughput increases , user satisfaction ( utility ) grows faster when throughput is low than when it is high .",
    "the lte - advanced standard @xcite introduces the carrier aggregation feature , which allows up to five component carriers ( ccs ) to be aggregated to form a single lte radio interface with a bandwidth of up to 100mhz in both downlink and uplink .",
    "the ccs can be either contiguous , non - contiguous or in different bands @xcite .",
    "our proposed dbf uses the lte air interface in both licensed and unlicensed bands via the lte carrier aggregation feature .",
    "lte was designed based on the assumption of exclusive spectrum use , which is not true in the unlicensed band where devices with different air interfaces coexist .",
    "however , existing channel access schemes in the unlicensed band such as the ieee 802.11 distributed coordination function ( dcf ) and point coordination function ( pcf ) @xcite , are not designed for cellular air interfaces , and do not align with the lte frame structure .",
    "lte transmissions are organized in periodic subframes in time , and can start only at the beginning of subframes @xcite . as a result , channel access attempts in the unlicensed band must take place right before the start time of subframes .",
    "otherwise , even though the fbs obtains the channel , it can not transmit until the start time of the next subframe , and may lose the transmission opportunity since other unlicensed - band devices will find the channel idle and transmit .",
    "therefore , in this section , we propose a channel access scheme that aligns with lte frame structure .",
    "once the access to the unlicensed band is obtained , the fbs will follow the standard lte air interface and assign radio resources to the sdevices through the licensed - band control channel .",
    "two guidelines are followed in the design of the dbf channel access scheme for the unlicensed band : 1 ) the fbs senses the unlicensed spectrum in order to avoid interference from ongoing transmissions by other unlicensed - band devices .",
    "2 ) the channel access scheme aligns with lte frame structure .",
    "[ fig_channel_access ] illustrates the proposed channel access scheme .",
    "the fbs attempts to access the channel at pre - assigned periodic time instants , called  access opportunities . \"",
    "the period of the access opportunities is denoted as @xmath3 . at each access opportunity",
    ", the fbs senses the unlicensed band , which takes @xmath18 seconds .",
    "if the channel is idle , the fbs will access the channel and use it for a fixed duration , @xmath19 ; otherwise , the fbs will wait for the next access opportunity .        as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_channel_access ] , to fit this channel access scheme with the periodic lte subframe structure , we require both @xmath3 and @xmath19 should be integer multiples of lte subframe duration which is 1ms @xcite . also , the @xmath3 includes the @xmath18 and the access opportunity must be @xmath18 before the lte subframe boundary so that the fbs can complete sensing the unlicensed band right at the lte subframe boundary and transmit using the whole lte subframe .",
    "moreover , as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec_dbf ] , a dbf fbs can adjust its unlicensed band usage by tuning the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath19 . in practice ,",
    "the channel sensing time @xmath18 is mainly determined by the hardware and is on the order of 10 microseconds @xcite which is far less than the @xmath3 and @xmath19 , therefore having negligible impact to dbf performance .    in order to prevent dbfs from keeping the channel for a long time ,",
    "the fbs should not access the channel immediately after a channel use .",
    "if the end of a transmission happens to be an access opportunity , the fbs should skip it ; if the end of a transmission is in between two access opportunities , the fbs should skip the access opportunity immediately following the end of the transmission .",
    "this guarantees that the dbf leaves at least @xmath3 seconds between two consecutive transmissions for other coexisting devices to access the unlicensed band .",
    "in this section , we formulate a traffic balancing strategy for dual - band small cells in cases 3 and 4 of fig .",
    "[ table:4usecases ] to assign traffic over the licensed and unlicensed bands .",
    "the formulation is independent of the unlicensed band rat , hence applicable to both ifw and dbf ; whereas the implementation will be rat - dependent and will be described in sec .",
    "[ sec_ifw ] for ifw and in sec .",
    "[ sec_dbf ] for dbf .",
    "the ifw and dbf access the unlicensed band based on channel sensing , so at most one device can use the channel at any given time , except for collisions .",
    "hence , the unlicensed band is shared in time among different devices , and the unlicensed - band usage can be best characterized by the fraction of time that a device occupies the channel .",
    "we will control small cell unlicensed - band usage by tuning its fraction of channel time @xmath20 , which will impact @xmath21 , the total fraction of channel time used by all the wdevices .",
    "the licensed band is simultaneously utilized by all small and macro cells , and some mdevices may experience severe interference from small cells @xcite .",
    "we will adjust fbs transmission power @xmath8 in subchannel @xmath10 , so that the interference to mdevices can be controlled , while the desired performance for sdevices is obtained .",
    "recall that in the system model in section [ sec : systemmodel ] , for both dbf and ifw small cells , there is an sdevice and @xmath0 wdevices which are used by a single user or single group of users .",
    "the sdevice shares the unlicensed band with @xmath0 wdevices and the licensed band with @xmath1 mdevices .",
    "the buffer status ( e.g. , full - buffer or not ) of the wdevices depends on not only their aggregate load @xmath4 , but also the dbf or ifw cell s channel time usage @xmath20 . for example , if @xmath22 , the wdevices will not be in full - buffer status when there is no other unlicensed band user ; however , in the dbf and ifw scenarios where @xmath23 , the wdevices will be in full - buffer status . recall that the sdevices always have traffic to receive , so the optimal @xmath20 should be such that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the maximum fraction of time that the unlicensed band can be used ; is determined by the channel access schemes in the unlicensed band , and is strictly less than one if channel - sensing based access schemes are used .",
    "if @xmath26 , then the unlicensed - band channel is always being used and all devices will detect channel busy and not access the channel , which contradicts the assumption @xmath26 . ] otherwise , part of the available unlicensed band channel will be unused , resulting in suboptimality .",
    "consequently , with optimal traffic balancing in the dbf or ifw cells , the wdevices will always be in full buffer status @xcite , although their traffic loads may be limited .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that for a wlan with full - buffer stations and no other unlicensed band users , wlan station @xmath27 s fraction of channel time @xmath28 is determined by the channel access parameters and channel conditions of all stations .",
    "hence , in dbf or ifw use case with optimal traffic balancing , the transmission time @xmath29 of wdevice @xmath27 ( in terms of fraction of the whole channel time ) is @xmath30 where @xmath21 is the channel usage of all @xmath0 wdevices .",
    "then the throughput of a wdevice is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is determined by wifi rate function @xmath5 and device @xmath27 s instantaneous sinr . in section",
    "[ sec : opt_solution ] , we show that @xmath28 has no impact to the final optimal solution .    the throughput of the sdevice is from both the licensed and unlicensed bands . in the licensed band ,",
    "the sdevice and mdevices simultaneously use the band , so power control is needed to keep the interference from the fbs to the mdevices below given thresholds . in the unlicensed band , the  listen before talk \" style of channel access is widely used ( e.g. , wifi ) , so interference is not a major issue ,",
    "hence we do not apply power control . recall that the fbs knows downlink sinr via device feedback , in addition ,",
    "the licensed and unlicensed bands use separate power budgets due to different government regulation requirements , so the unlicensed band data rate @xmath33 is a constant that is determined by wifi rate function @xmath5 ( for ifw ) , lte rate function @xmath6 ( for dbf ) and the instantaneous sinr in the unlicensed band . the unlicensed band channel is shared by sdevices and wdevices in time , so we control the fraction of channel time @xmath20 that is used by the sdevice .",
    "then the sdevice throughput is @xmath34 where @xmath8 is the transmission power in subchannel @xmath10 of the licensed band .",
    "the optimization problem can be formulated as , @xmath35 constraint ( [ opt_prob : cond_imax ] ) follows the widely - adopted principle @xcite in two - tiered networks which requires that the interference power leaked from the small cell to the macrocell can not exceed the maximum allowed interference temperature @xmath36 in subchannel @xmath10 ( @xmath37 ) , which are predefined system parameters that determine the performance tradeoff between macro and small cells in the licensed band .",
    "constraint ( [ opt_prob : range_tf ] ) shows the fact that , in practice , the total unlicensed band usage must be less or equal to the maximum fraction of time @xmath25 that the unlicensed band can be used .",
    "constraint ( [ opt_prob : range_tbar ] ) specifies that the aggregate wdevice channel usage can not exceed the time determined by their aggregate traffic load .",
    "for the convenience of presentation , we treat @xmath21 as a variable for the fbs to optimize in the problem formulation above ; however , the final solution in section [ sec : opt_solution ] shows that the fbs does not need to adjust @xmath21  whenever the fbs adjusts its @xmath20 , the @xmath21 is automatically adjusted .",
    "the objective ( [ opt_prob : obj ] ) maximizes the total user experience / utility from all the sdevice and wdevices used by the user ( or group of users ) , and is equivalent to @xmath38    the mathematical formulation ( [ opt_prob : obj])-([opt_prob : range_pf ] ) shares some similarities with the optimization problem in @xcite ; however , unlike @xcite which only considers the licensed band , our optimization considers traffic balancing over both licensed and unlicensed bands .      in the above optimization problem",
    ", @xmath8 affects the sum utility ( [ opt_prob : obj ] ) only through the small cell licensed - band throughput @xmath39 .",

    "therefore , to find the optimal @xmath8 , we solve the following optimization problem , @xmath41 after obtaining the optimal @xmath42 , finding the optimal @xmath20 to the original optimization problem ( [ opt_prob : obj])-([opt_prob : range_pf ] ) is equivalent to the following , @xmath43 we first consider the optimization in ( [ opt_prob2:obj])-([opt_prob2:cond_pmax_k ] ) . in this subsection",
    "we solve the problem assuming that the rate function @xmath6 is given by shannon capacity , that is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the bandwidth of a small cell subchannel in the licensed band . in section [ subsec : traffic - assign - implementation ]",
    "we will discuss how this analysis can be extended to the case when @xmath6 is obtained using an approximation to the lte rate function .",
    "using the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) conditions @xcite , it is easy to see that the solution to ( [ opt_prob2:obj])-([opt_prob2:cond_pmax_k ] ) with @xmath6 defined in ( [ eq : ratefunction ] ) is given by @xmath46 here @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is chosen to satisfy ( [ opt_prob2:cond_ptot ] ) with equality .",

    "@xcite@xcite , which allocates power into subchannels similar to regular water - filling procedure , with the only difference that the power in subchannel @xmath10 must be below @xmath49 .    based on the optimal @xmath42 obtained above",
    ", we next solve the second optimization problem ( [ opt_prob3:obj])-([opt_prob3:range_tf ] ) .",

    "dbf+wlan , optimal \" case , the intuitions from section [ subsec : intuitions ] suggest that our traffic balancing algorithm translates the total sdevice throughput ( of licensed and unlicensed bands ) into the unlicensed band channel time @xmath62 ( = 38mbps/78mbps=0.49 ) , and tries to guarantee that @xmath62 is an _ equal share of the combined channel time _ @xmath65 ( @xmath165=33.7mbps/72mbps=0.47 ) .",
    "the resulting optimal @xmath92 is 0.42 in this case .",
    "the same observation can be made by comparing results betweenifw , simple \" and  ifw , optimal \" cases . * in  wifi hotspot \" case , the throughput disparity between sdevice and wdevice is small , due to the natural long - term fairness of wifi mac protocol ( sdevice throughput is slightly higher than wdevice due to higher sdevice traffic load ) , so the effective @xmath20 is close to the optimal @xmath92 ( = 0.45 ) for zero - hz licensed bandwidth ( see fig .",

    "[ fig_topology ] is considered .",
    "a mbs is placed at the center of the macrocell with radius 700 m .",
    "thirty ( 30 ) mdevices are randomly dropped in the macrocell with uniform distribution . due to the uniformly distributed mdevice locations",
    ", some mdevices may be very close to fbss .",
    "we assume that houses are located on 2d grid points with a center - to - center distance of 70 m .",
    "forty ( 40 ) houses are randomly selected ; each selected house is given one sdevice and one wdevice , which are randomly placed within the fbs coverage area with a radius of 20 m .",
    "in the use case of dbf , a wifi ap is also placed in the selected house with a coverage radius of 20 m . in this topology , the interference between houses is small , so each house is like an  island \" .",
    "therefore , the algorithm developed in the previous section is applicable to this topology . although the traffic - balancing algorithm does not consider the interference among houses , other parts of our simulator ( e.g. , sinr evaluation ) do .",
    "we consider the scenario where the aggregate uplink and downlink wdevice load is 35mbps ( 50% of which is for uplink ) , which is lower than the highest physical layer data rate 72mbps for single - antenna 802.11n and lower than the highest achievable mac layer throughput 61mbps in our setup .",
    "figures [ fig : thru-10mhz ] and [ fig : sim-10mhz ] show the throughput per device , utility per device , and utility per user .",
    "note that each small cell user uses one sdevice and one wdevice ; whereas each macro user uses one mdevice .",
    "we have the following observations from the figures .",
    "first , the small cell optimal traffic - balancing algorithm significantly improves mdevice performance , while it does not significantly affect the performance of sdevice or wdevice .",
    "this can be verified by comparing scenario  ifw , simple \" with  ifw , optimal , \" and  dbf+wlan , simple \" with ",
    "dbf+wlan , optimal . \"",
    "the is mainly due to the licensed band power control included in the algorithm which reduces the interference from small cells to the macrocell .",
    "second , using two bands simultaneously as in the ifw and dbf improves the average utility and throughput of _ all devices_. the proposed traffic - balancing strategy shown in ",
    "ifw , optimal \" and  dbf+wlan , optimal \" obtain higher average utilities than the other cases , including ",
    "ifw , simple \" and  dbf+wlan , simple . \"",
    "third , there is very little utility or throughput difference between the ifw and dbf cases .",
    "forth , the  wifi hotspot \" scenario has better good macro user utility , which is mainly due to no interference to mdevice ; in contrast , the fbss in ",
    "dbf+wlan , optimal \" and  ifw , optimal \" cases can only reduce , but not eliminate , interference to mdevices . while the proposed traffic - balancing algorithm does not obtain the highest average throughput ,",
    "this is not surprising , since it is designed to achieve performance fairness through the utility function .",
    "note that in all cases discussed , the total bandwidth is 30 mhz ( licensed 10 mhz , unlicensed 20 mhz ) ; however , the way this bandwidth is shared among classes of devices is different in each case .",
    "small cells have been considered as effective means to boost the wireless capacity . in this paper , we have described the dual - band femtocell ( dbf ) that simultaneously uses the lte air interface in licensed and unlicensed bands based on the lte carrier aggregation feature .",
    "we have proposed a channel access scheme for dbfs to access the unlicensed band .",
    "furthermore , we have described a traffic balancing algorithm for small cells , including the dbf and the integrated femto - wifi ( ifw ) proposed by the small cell forum , to use both licensed and unlicensed bands in an optimized fashion thereby improving the overall user utility / satisfaction from macrocell , small cell and non - cellular wifi - only devices .",
    "the algorithm searches for the optimal power allocation in the licensed band , and the optimal channel time usage in the unlicensed band .",
    "we have also proposed practical algorithms to tune the unlicensed - band channel time usages for ifws and dbfs , which uses the wifi and lte air interfaces in the unlicensed band , respectively .",
    "our results illustrate that , in terms of average user utility , both ifw and dbf outperform current wifi hotspot and femtocell approaches and thus are attractive technologies for emerging small cell applications .",
    "while ifw and dbf have comparable performance , we have the following observations from an implementation perspective .",
    "* * ifw : * the ifw has separate cellular and wifi radio interfaces in licensed and unlicensed bands .",
    "hence , it is backward compatible with existing cellular and wlan devices .",
    "however , special effort is required for a single application flow to simultaneously use two radio interfaces @xcite .",
    "* * dbf : * the dbf is actively under 3gpp lte standardization @xcite , where the unlicensed band is a secondary carrier in carrier aggregation .",
    "therefore , the dbf has a single radio interface .",
    "the dbf bs informs its devices , via licensed - band control channel , about when and which subchannel to receive their data in both licensed and unlicensed bands .",
    "the dbf is backward compatible with existing lte devices .",
