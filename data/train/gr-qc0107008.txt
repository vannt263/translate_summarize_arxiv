    "the theory of general relativity lead us to the conception of a generally curved geometry of the spacetime whose source encompass all matter and energy content of the universe . the comparative study between the kinematic aspects of general relativity and other kinds of interactions has recently been called as _ analog models _ for gravitation @xcite . indeed , it have extensively been examined , not only with respect to electrodynamics ( non - linear @xcite as well as in moving dielectric fluids @xcite ) but also for acoustic perturbations @xcite . long ago , gordon @xcite shown that the refractive index of a medium can be reinterpreted by means of an effective metric @xmath0 , where @xmath1 represents the velocity 4-vector of an arbitrary observer .",
