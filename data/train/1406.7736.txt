    "[ propksmsurj ] the deformation @xmath3039 of @xmath0 constructed in section [ sectversalconstruction ] has surjective kodaira - spencer map .",

    "a deformation @xmath3040 of @xmath0 with the basepoint @xmath3041 is called _ formally versal in the class of @xmath1-equivariant deformations _ if the following holds .",
    "let @xmath3042 be another @xmath1-equivariant deformation of @xmath0 , and let @xmath3043 be the basepoint of this deformation .    denote by @xmath3044 the formal neighborhood of @xmath3045 in @xmath3046 . denote by @xmath3047 the restriction of the deformation @xmath3048 to @xmath3044 .",

    "then fromal versality means that there exists a morphism @xmath3054 such that the deformation @xmath3055 is the pullback of the deformation @xmath3056 via this map @xmath77 .",
    "[ ksmsurjimpliesversal ] let @xmath0 be a @xmath1-variety , let @xmath2286 be a vector space , and let @xmath3039 be an equivariant deformation .",

    "suppose that the kodaira - spencer map for this deformation is surjective onto @xmath3 , which is finite dimensional .",
    "then @xmath3039 is an equivariant formally versal deformation of @xmath0 .",
    "first , one can check that a formally versal deformation exists using ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.11 ) .",
    "the conditions ( @xmath3057 ) and ( @xmath3058 ) are verified exactly in the same way as they are verified for non - equivariant deformation , see section 3.7 of @xcite .",
    "one has to use graded algebras and equivariant maps between them , but the arguments stay the same . condition ( @xmath3059 ) is our assumption that @xmath3 is finite dimensional .",

    "denote by @xmath1037 the vector space with coordinates @xmath3064 .",
    "then the tangent space of @xmath1708 at the geometric point becomes a subspace of @xmath1037 . after a linear change of variables",
    "we may suppose that this tangent space is defined by the equations @xmath3065 .",
    "then @xmath3066 are coordinates on @xmath3 .    in the proof of this proposition",

    "let @xmath77 be a morphism from the formal neighborhood of zero in @xmath2286 to @xmath1708 such that @xmath3039 is the pullback via @xmath77 of the formally versal equivariant deformation over @xmath1708 .",
    "then @xmath3067 is the kodaira - spencer map .",

    "these series do not have constant terms .",
    "the first @xmath1179 of them have nontrivial linear terms , the last @xmath3072 power series do not have terms of degree less than two .    since the kodaira - spencer map is an isomorphism , without loss of generality ( after a suitable linear change of coordinates in @xmath2286 ) we may suppose that the linear term in @xmath381 , where @xmath3073 , is exactly @xmath1873 . in other words , @xmath3074 for @xmath3073 .",
    "now , using iterated corrections in higher and higher degrees , we can find power series @xmath3075 in @xmath3066 ( the variables @xmath3076 will not appear there ) such that @xmath3077 .",
    "in other words , the map @xmath77 between the formal neighborhoods of the marked points is invertible , in other words , it is an isomorphism .",
    "hence , @xmath3039 is also an equivariant formally versal deformation .",
    "in fact , this proposition holds true if @xmath2286 is smooth , but not necessarily a vector space .",
    "the proof is more complicated in this case .",
