    "the fabrication of nanowires through anodization and electrodeposition provides an interesting opportunity for the study of percolation . before presenting the details of how this comes about",
    ", we first introduce the related key topics .",
    "under proper conditions , the anodization of aluminum creates a thin layer of alumina containing a highly ordered hcp array of pores @xcite .",
    "these pores , though typically of a uniform size in a well made sample , can have diameters ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm .",
    "their length , being a function of time , can easily extend to the micron scale .",
    "electrodeposition of metals such as au , ag , co , ni , or fe results in a self - assembled and highly ordered array of cylindrical nanowires .",
    "post - fabrication , the nanowires exist as a bulk sample ; they remain embedded within the alumina .",
    "if it is so desired , a chemical etch can remove the alumina and release the nanowires into solution .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the etching of a sample at different times .",
    "percolation theory has been used to study conductivity in a variety of electrical systems @xcite , but more recently has seen applications to carbon nanotubes @xcite and the growth of v@xmath6o@xmath7 nanowires @xcite . in these examples ,",
    "the nanostructures are initially suspended in solution and allowed to settle on the surface of a substrate .",
    "the resulting random network is probed for a conductive path as a function of surface coverage .",
    "generally , it is found that at some critical density , the conductivity rapidly increases as more electrical paths become available for the current .",
    "the key observation which relates percolation and nanowire fabrication in alumina templates , is the behavior of clumping . as has been reported @xcite , during the etching process , nanowires tend to clump into bundles .",
    "if the process is interrupted at various times , the average clump size ( i.e. number of nanowires in direct physical contact ) is seen to grow .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows a typical example of this behavior .    in an experimentally realizable scenario ,",
    "the clumped nanowires can be tested for conductive percolation by placing electrical contacts along two opposing edges of the sample . when the template has been sufficiently etched ( as in figure [ fig1]c ) , an electrical path should be observed in the form of a percolating cluster .",
    "inspired by these results , we consider a two dimensional array of nanowires , modeled as elastic rods , and subject to van der waals interaction forces . in the model , we consider the nanowire length a linear function of time to simulate the effect of etching .",
    "the dynamics of this system are simulated in matlab and it is observed that given sufficient etch time , the nanowires bend in the direction of their neighbors .",
    "this gives rise to clusters of variable size which we interpret from the view of percolation theory . in section [ surface ] the van der waals interaction force",
    "is derived for the cylindrical geometry of two nanowires . in section [ rod ]",
    "we review the equations of equilibrium which describe the bending of elastic rods . in section [ num ]",
    "the numerical results are presented and discussed in terms of percolation . in section [ conc ]",
    "two experiments are proposed which would quantitatively verify the model described in this work .",
    "to calculate the interaction forces between two macroscopic bodies , we use the non - retarded van der waals potential . if we consider the bodies to be composed of discrete point - like atoms , the total energy of interaction can be written as the sum @xmath8 we denote by @xmath9 the separation between two given particles , the @xmath10 in the first body and the @xmath11 in the second .",
    "the constant @xmath12 is the coefficient of the atom - atom pair potential .",
    "passing to the continuum limit , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of atoms per unit volume . because we are interested in the interaction of two nanowires , the natural coordinates are cylindrical ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen from simple vector algebra that @xmath15 expanding the denominator of eq.([surface2 ] ) in terms of components , the integral can be calculated .",
    "the final result is @xcite @xmath16 where a is the hamaker constant defined by @xmath17    the force arising from this potential is , @xmath18 where @xmath19 . letting @xmath20 , @xmath21 when immersed in aqueous solution , the hamaker constant",
    "is not accurately given by eq.([surface4a ] ) . because interactions in the medium effect the pair - wise potential , experimentally determined results for metals in water must be used @xcite .",
    "we now review the equations of equilibrium for a rod subject to external forces .",
    "the discussion closely follows @xcite and only the main results will be presented .",
    "consider a thin rod of circular cross - section . to an infinitesimal length ,",
    "assign local coordinates @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 so the @xmath24-axis is aligned parallel to the rod .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath25 be a curve parameterized by arc length describing the local coordinates , and hence , the unit tangent vector is given by @xmath26 .",
    "we define @xmath27 to be the rotation of the local coordinates along the rod and notice that in the absence of torsion , @xmath28 . moving along an infinitesimal length ,",
    "the change in the tangent vector is given by @xmath29 taking the cross product of both sides with @xmath30 and rearranging , we find the expression @xmath31 in the case of pure bending , the last term is zero due to the absence of torsion .",
    "let the moment vector @xmath32 be defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is young s modulus and @xmath35 is the moment of inertia of the cross section for a cylinder . as a condition for equilibrium , the total moment of the forces is zero , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "dividing by @xmath37 , @xmath38 rearranging eqs.([rod3 ] - [ rod5 ] ) , we find the equation of equilibrium for pure bending in a circular rod : @xmath39",
    "to estimate the magnitude of the force in eq.([surface6 ] ) and the amount of displacement the tip of a nanowire will undergo , characteristic values are used @xcite . for au nanowires with radius @xmath40 nm , interpore separation @xmath41 nm , length @xmath42 nm , and hamaker constant @xmath43 j , the force @xmath44 pn .",
    "the amount of deflection can be found by treating the nanowire as a cantilever with deflection @xmath45 . for au , young s modulus @xmath46 pa , the moment of inertia of the cross - section is @xmath47 m@xmath48 , and",
    "consequently , the deflection is @xmath49 nm . this estimate indicates that van der waals forces are sufficiently capable of bending the nanowires .",
    "consequently , we proceed to a more sophisticated numerical solution of the equations involving an array of nanowires .",
    "the array of nanowires is simulated using a @xmath50 order runge - kutta method to solve eq.([rod6 ] ) subject to the forces given by eq.([surface6 ] ) on a square grid .",
    "each grid site @xmath51 corresponds to an individual nanowire and the forces acting on it are determined by nearest neighbor interactions solely concentrated at the tip . because each nanowire is treated as an elastic rod , the net forces cause bending accordingly .",
    "the continuous etching of alumina shown in figure [ fig1 ] is simulated by making the length of each nanowire a linear function of time .",
    "thus , taking @xmath52 where @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath54 is constant , the process can be stopped at each unit of time and checked for percolation .",
    "furthermore , the length of each nanowire is randomized to within @xmath55 of the maximum value to reflect experimental observations .",
    "the boundries were treated as infinitely stiff rods and hence , not subject to interaction forces .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows a @xmath56 sample simulation where some nanowires have already made physical contact with their neighbors .    in a @xmath57 representation ,",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows typical results for repeated simulations of various etch times .",
    "the blue line segments represent physical contact between two grid points and the largest clusters have been colored red .",
    "each simulation was deemed percolating when a cluster spanned the full horizontal distance . running 500 simulations for each @xmath58 , the probability of percolation was determined .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] displays these results along with the fitted curve @xmath59 where @xmath60 and the critical exponent @xmath1 .",
    "this nonlinear scaling is indicative of the percolation threshold .    near the threshold",
    ", percolation theory predicts that the probability of percolation as a function of the probability of physical contact , @xmath61 , will obey @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 can be related to other critical exponents of the system .",
    "similarly , the mean cluster size as a function of the probability of physical contact , @xmath64 , goes like @xmath65 from figures [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , can be read from the curve fits .",
    "the full set of critical exponents is determined by the equations @xmath68 therefore , in ( dimension ) @xmath3 for the percolating nanowire network subject to van der waals interaction , the complete set of critical exponents is given by @xmath69 and with the aid of eqs.([num3 ] ) , @xmath70 and @xmath5 .",
    "the goal of this work was to quantitatively explain and describe the phenomenon of nanowire clumping during the etching of ordered nanowire arrays .",
    "having accomplished this task , we now outline two potential experiments which could be used to verify the predicted critical exponents . in the first case",
    ", a number of samples could be fabricated in the laboratory and by means of _ counting small subregions _ , all the numerically simulated results could be readily verified .",
    "the alternative experiment involves measuring the conductivity across an array of nanowires while the alumina is etched . at time",
    "@xmath71 , all the nanowires would be embedded in the alumina ( an insulator ) and no current would flow . at some time @xmath72 , the first percolating cluster would form and the current density would increase from @xmath73 . continuing the measurements for longer time , the conductivity would increase further as more pathways through the nanowire array opened up allowing a greater current to flow . as @xmath74 , the conductivity would approach a constant value when the clusters have fully formed and no more potential pathways exist . by means of the usual analysis in conductive percolation @xcite , the relevant statistical distributions can be determined from this data .    in conclusion ,",
    "the qualitative observation of clumping was modeled by elastic rods subject to van der waals interaction forces .",
    "simulations in matlab revealed a percolative phase transition , from which , the critical exponents were extracted .",
