    "the discovery of iron - based superconductors  @xcite ( fesc ) put forward experimental and theoretical efforts to understand the reason for rather high critical temperatures and symmetry of superconducting order parameters in these compounds .",
    "these studies yielded a comprehensive experimental description of the electronic fermi surface structure , which includes multiple fermi surface sheets in a good agreement with density functional calculations  @xcite .",
    "the fermi surface of the moderate doped fesc is given by two small hole pockets around @xmath2 point and two electron pockets around @xmath3 point in the folded zone .",
    "this band structure suggests strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations , which may be a mechanism for electron pairing . in this case , the natural order parameter for most of the fesc is so called @xmath4 state , described by the nodeless order parameter with different signs for electron and hole - like pockets .",
    "this model agrees well with the experimentally found for most of the moderately doped fe - based superconductors nodeless character of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "however a question , whether the order parameter changes its sign by changeover from electron - like to hole - like pockets , is still under discussion . moreover , relative robustness of the superconductors against nonmagnetic impurities led to a suggestion that a more conventional two - band order parameter a uniform sign change ( @xmath5 ) is realized in these systems  @xcite .    in our previous paper @xcite it was demonstrated that not only superconductors with @xmath5 order parameter but also @xmath4 may be robust against nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "therefore the robustness against nonmagnetic impurities can not be considered as a strong argument against @xmath0 order parameter .",
    "moreover , it was shown , that there are two types of @xmath0-superconductors with respect to disorder @xcite . in the first",
    "one @xmath6 goes down as disorder is increased , until it vanishes at a critical value of the scattering rate .",
    "this behavior is similar to the famous case of abrikosov - gorkov magnetic impurities .",
    "it is widely discussed in the literature . in the second type of @xmath0 superconductors",
    "@xmath7 tends to a finite value as disorder is increased @xcite ; at the same time the gap functions for the electron - like and hole - like fermi surfaces acquire the same signs , i.e. the transition occurs from @xmath0 to @xmath5 .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss how the disorder induced transition @xmath8 can display itself in single particle properties and optical conductivity .",
    "it is shown that disorder dependence of these characteristics at the transition point is strongly nonmonotonic function of the impurity scattering rate and can be easily seen in tunneling spectroscopy , arpes and optics",
    ". therefore systematic study of disorder effects by means formally phase insensitive techniques , mentioned above , may provide information about the sign of the underlying order parameter in the clean limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the section",
    "ii we discuss the approximation used for the calculations .",
    "the section iii is devoted to single particle properties .",
    "we discuss how the transition @xmath8 manifests itself in arpes and tunneling spectroscopy . in the section iii",
    "we calculate the two - particle response function and discuss peculiarities which can be seen in optical conductivity in the vicinity of the transition point .",
    "the article is concluded with discussions .",
    "for the calculations we employ the standard approach of quasiclassical ( @xmath9 - integrated ) green functions in nambu and band space @xcite : @xmath10 with band quasiclassical green functions @xmath11 where the @xmath12 denote pauli matrices in nambu space and @xmath13 is the density of states on the fermi level in the band @xmath14 ( for the sake of simplicity the two band model is considered ) .",

    "the symmetry of the order parameter in the clean case is determined solely by the off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "the case   $ sign \\lambda^{\\tilde\\phi}_{a b } = sign \\lambda^{\\tilde\\phi}_{b a } > 0 $ corresponds to $ { { s_{++}}}$ superconductivity and $ sign\\lambda^{\\tilde\\phi}_{a b } = sign \\lambda^{\\tilde\\phi}_{b a } < 0 $ to $ { { s_{\\pm}}}$.   the matrix elements $ \\lambda^{\\tilde\\omega}_{\\alpha\\beta } $ have to be positive and   are chosen $ \\lambda^{\\tilde\\omega}_{\\alpha\\beta } = |\\lambda^{\\tilde\\phi}_{\\alpha\\beta}|$. for further calculations   we use the same matrix $ \\lambda^{\\tilde\\phi}_{aa}=3 $ , $ \\lambda^{\\tilde\\phi}_{bb}=0.5 $ , $ \\lambda^{\\tilde\\phi}_{ab}=-0.2 $ , $ \\lambda^{\\tilde\\phi}_{ba}=-0.1 $ for $ { { s_{\\pm}}}$-case and $ \\lambda^{\\tilde\\phi}_{aa}=3 $ , $ \\lambda^{\\tilde\\phi}_{bb}=0.5 $ , $ \\lambda^{\\tilde\\phi}_{ab}=0.2 $ , $ \\lambda^{\\tilde\\phi}_{ba}=0.1 $ for $ { { s_{++}}}$-case .",
