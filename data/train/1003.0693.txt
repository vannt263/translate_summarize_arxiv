    "in the local universe , large scale gas outflows are observed to arise in galaxies exhibiting high surface densities of star formation . while the precise roles of such outflows , including galactic `` superwinds '' , in galaxy evolution are still being determined , simulations suggest that the balance between outflows and the accretion of cool gas is one of the primary mechanisms by which star formation is regulated in individual halos ( e.g. , oppenheimer et al . , 2009 ; brooks et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "at the current epoch , the highest star formation rate ( sfr ) surface densities  and therefore galactic winds  are preferentially found in relatively low - mass halos , such as those hosting dwarf starburst galaxies .",
    "however , the mass of halos containing the highest specific star formation rates ( ssfrs ) are thought to increase with increasing look - back time , consistent with `` top - down '' galaxy formation scenarios ( cowie et al . , 1996 ; neistein et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "tracking the occurrence of galactic winds across cosmic time , particularly in manners unbiased by luminosity or halo mass , would provide a powerful way to study such models .",
    "furthermore , outflows are believed to be required to explain a wide variety of astrophysical observations , from the shape of the galaxy luminosity function ( benson et al .",
    ", 2003 ; khochfar et al . , 2007 ) , to the stellar mass - metallicity relation ( tremonti , 2004 ; erb et al . , 2006 ; brooks et al . , 2007 ; finlator & dav , 2008 ) , the large extent of dust and metals in galactic halos and in the intergalactic medium ( scannapieco , ferrara , & madau , 2002 ; oppenheimer & dav , 2006 ; kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) , and many other related phenomena .",
    "despite their clear importance in the galaxy formation process , outflows have generally been overlooked theoretically and , until recently , have proved difficult to study observationally at redshifts @xmath3 , the epoch when the universe formed most of its stars and superwinds were ubiquitous .",
    "surveys have identified outflowing gas from galaxies at redshift @xmath4 through strong , blue - shifted resonance - line absorption in their spectra arising in low - ion gas entrained in the flows ( e.g. , pettini et al . , 2001 ; shapley et al . , 2003 ; tremonti , moustakas , & diamond - stanic , 2007 ; wiener et al . , 2009 ) . however , there are two important limitations inherent in methods which rely only on spectra of the outflow hosts .",
    "first , they provide no information on the location of the outflowing gas ; it is only presumed that the material reaches the igm . secondly , these surveys searched for evidence of outflows in spectra of either the brightest galaxies at the relevant redshift , known star - forming galaxies , or known post - starburst galaxies .",
    "what is needed is the reverse experiment : a survey of the galaxies from which known large - scale outflows originate .",
    "this begs the question : how does one identify a galactic wind without _ a priori _ knowledge of the galaxy itself ?",
    "quasar absorption lines may offer such an opportunity , as they select galaxies based on the gas absorption cross section , with no direct dependence on emission from the galaxy .",
    "the physical processes that determine the properties of intervening low - ion quasar absorption line systems are not well understood .",
    "while it has long been known that such absorbers can in general be identified with individual galaxies ( e.g. , bergeron & boiss , 1991 ; steidel , dickinson , & persson , 1994 ) correlations between emission ( i.e. , of the galaxy ) and absorption ( i.e. , strength and velocity structure of the absorbing gas ) properties have been elusive ( kacprzak et al . , 2007 ) and/or inconclusive ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    ", 2002 ; kacprzak et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "the strongest absorbers , which have until recently been neglected due to their relative scarcity , may hold important clues .",
    "for example , bond et al .",
    "( 2001 ) considered the velocity profiles of the strongest  absorbers known at the time ( rest equivalent widths @xmath5@xmath6 ) measured with high - resolution spectroscopy , and proposed that such systems may arise in galactic superwinds .    detections of outflows through broad low - ion absorption in the spectra of starbursting galaxies suggest that galactic winds _ can _ result in very strong  absorption along a sightline past a galaxy . however , this does not necessarily imply that all or even any of the strongest intervening absorbers detected in quasar spectra actually _ do _ arise in the winds of foreground galaxies .",
    "indeed , models have been proposed that account for the observed distribution of  absorption strength without relying on outflows ( e.g. , tinker & chen 2008 ) .",
    "alternatively , the huge kinematic spreads that define the strongest systems may be due simply to the chance intersection of the sightline with multiple `` normal ''  absorbing galaxies in a rich group or cluster , as first suggested by pettini et al .",
    "( 1983 ) .",
    "very large  absorber surveys ( e.g. , nestor et al . , 2005 ; prochter , prochaska , & burles , 2006 ; quider et al . , 2010 ) , which are now becoming available , have uncovered large numbers ( e.g. , @xmath7 in quider et al . ) of `` ultra - strong ''  ( ) systems with @xmath5@xmath8 .",
    "catalogs of such systems afford the opportunity to explore in depth the proposed  absorber - galactic wind connection .",
    "recent work has already given support for a connection between the strongest  systems and star forming galaxies , which is usually considered as support of an outflow scenario .",
    "for example , by stacking thousands of relatively - shallow sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) images of the fields of strong  absorption systems zibetti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) demonstrated the strongest systems are associated with bluer galaxies closer to the sightline to the background quasar compared to weaker systems .",
    "similarly , bouch et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have detected strong h@xmath9 emission at the absorption redshift towards strong  absorbers and rubin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have identified an  absorber in the spectrum of a background galaxy that they identify with a wind from a foreground galaxy .",
    "perhaps the most compelling evidence suggesting a connection between  absorbers and star formation is the relation between @xmath5  and  emission discussed by mnard et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , wherein they demonstrate that the strongest  absorbers are on average associated with the highest  luminosity densities and are therefore likely to be hosted by vigorously star - forming galaxies .",
    "nestor et al .",
    "( 2007 ; hereafter ntrq ) published the first imaging survey aimed specifically at the strongest  absorption systems , including images of the fields of thirteen moderate - redshift ( @xmath10 )  systems .",
    "these revealed bright galaxies at relatively low impact parameter to the absorption sightline ( compared to the fields of most  absorbers ) . while consistent with the outflow model in general and , e.g. , the results of zibetti et al . , in particular , detailed study of the galaxies associated with  absorbers is needed to test this putative connection . if the `` ultra - strong '' nature of these absorbers is indeed linked to galactic winds , we expect to find evidence of recent , high mass fraction starbursts in one or more of the low impact parameter ( low-@xmath11 ) galaxies . in this paper",
    ", we present the results of an imaging and spectroscopic study of the galaxies detected in two  absorber fields from the ntrq sample , conducted to test both the  absorber / outflow connection and alternative models . in ",
    "2 we describe the selection of targets , observations and reductions of our data , and our basic observational results . in  3 we discuss the properties of the galaxies determined to be at similar redshift to the  systems .",
    "we present further discussion in  4 and  5 , and summarize the paper in  6 . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14     and state magnitudes in the ab system .",
    "the targets for imaging in ntrq were chosen from the now publicly - available pittsburgh  absorber catalog ( quider et al . , 2010 ) based solely on @xmath5 , absorption redshift and observability , and",
    "thus should represent an otherwise unbiased sample of  absorber environments at those redshifts .",
    "many of the images from that study reveal a fairly bright ( @xmath15 ) isolated galaxy or clump of emission at small impact parameter ( @xmath16 ) to the sightline , representing clear candidates for the object(s ) associated with the absorption .",
    "we were awarded 23 hours of the gemini - north queue in semester 2008a to obtain spectra of these candidates using the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) . however , as the time was awarded in `` band 3 '' , it was likely that the observations would take place in sub - optimal conditions",
    ". thus , it would be exceedingly difficult to obtain observations of targets with particularly faint apparent magnitudes or those with small angular separation from the background quasar .",
    "therefore , we limited the observations to long exposures of three fields from ntrq : those towards sdss j074707.62 + 305415 ( hereafter q0747 + 305 ; @xmath17 , @xmath5@xmath18 ) , sdss j101142.01 + 445155.4 ( q1011 + 445 ; @xmath19 , @xmath5@xmath20 ) and sdss j141751.84 + 011556.1 ( q1417 + 011 ; @xmath21 , @xmath5@xmath22 ) .",
    "the primary absorber - galaxy candidates in these fields are all relatively bright ( @xmath23 )  although the long exposures allow the determination of redshifts for fainter targets , as well  and at sufficiently large impact parameter ( @xmath24 ) to place slitlets that avoid the point spread function of the quasar even in poor seeing .",
    "these are the three fields that ntrq categorize as `` bright '' in their descriptions of the  absorber environments .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , as these fields differ in appearance from the majority of those imaged in ntrq , they might not be representative of  systems in general .",
    "we discuss this further in ",
    "[ sect : discusion ] .",
    "we show the  absorption region of the sdss spectrum of the quasar in the q0747 + 305 and q1417 + 011 fields in figures [ fig:0747 ] and [ fig:1417 ] .",
    "the absorber towards q0747 + 305 has an observed profile consistent with the minimum possible velocity spread given its @xmath5 , @xmath25  .",
    "for the absorber towards q1417 + 011 , the doublet members are blended but the profiles appear to span @xmath26  .",
    "the vertical lines in each figure correspond to relative velocity offsets of galaxies in the field ( see below ) .",
    "pre - imaging was obtained for the three fields with the @xmath27-band filter on gmos early in semester 2008a . as the wiyn photometry from ntrq",
    "utilized the @xmath28-band for these three fields , the relatively deep pre - imaging also provided @xmath29 ( @xmath30  rest - frame @xmath31 at @xmath32 ) colours for sources detected in both data sets . reduced and combined images were provided by gemini .",
    "sextractor ( bertin & arnouts , 1996 ) was used for deblending of sources and obtaining photometric measurements .",
    "photometric zero - points were determined using bright unsaturated sources in our images having sdss magnitudes available from the sdss website .",
    "slit masks were designed with 2-wide slitlets and lengths which varied to optimize placement in the crowded regions near the quasar while still allowing for individual sky measurements .",
    "spectra were obtained in the q0747 + 305 field on 4 and 13 march 2008 with total integration time of 22800s over twelve individual exposures , and in the q1417 + 011 field on 1 , 2 , 10 and 12 may and 11 june 2008 with a total integration time of 28500s over fifteen exposures .",
    "a single exposure of 1900s in the q1011 + 445 field was obtained on 12 april 2008 , but with an insufficient signal to noise ratio for scientific purposes ; we thus limit further discussion to the q0747 + 305 and q1417 + 001 fields .",
    "all spectra were obtained using the r400 grating and og515 filter with three different grating tilts to obtain continuous coverage across the detector gaps .",
    "spectra were reduced and extracted in standard fashion with exposures of quartz halogen and cuar lamps used for flat - fielding and wavelength calibration .",
    "individual sky - subtracted extracted spectra were combined with weighting by signal to noise ratio .",
    "slitlets were placed over stars in each field , which aided in the removal of telluric features in the spectra .",
    "a single observation of hz44 on 13 march 2008 was provided to facilitate relative spectro - photometric calibration .",
    "absolute spectro - photometric calibration was achieved by comparing synthetic magnitudes derived from the spectra to our photometry .",
    "the pre - imaging was accomplished under better than expected conditions , with low atmospheric attenuation and seeing of @xmath33 for each field .",
    "the images are deeper than the @xmath28-band images from ntrq , with @xmath34 down to @xmath35 for compact sources .",
    "the signal to noise ratios of the resulting spectra varied with both wavelength and the brightness of the source , and for our primary targets ranged from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "subtraction of sky emission lines was problematic , particularly in the red wavelengths and for the fainter sources .",
    "similarly , correcting for telluric absorption was only moderately successful .",
    "we tested our relative spectrophotometric calibration by comparing synthetic colours derived from the calibrated spectra of our brighter sources to colours from the sdss , as well as a direct comparison of the spectrum of one source that was spectroscopically observed by both us and the sdss .",
    "various issues complicated such comparisons , such as slit losses and photometric uncertainties .",
    "thus , we are only able to put a limit on our relative spectrophotometric accuracy of better than @xmath38 twenty per cent .",
    "emission lines were fit with single gaussian profiles ( no emission multiplets were resolved ) and line fluxes and flux uncertainties determined using an optimal extraction procedure .",
    "the region of the gmos @xmath27-band image surrounding the sightline for this field is shown with slitlet positions overlaid in figure  [ fig:0747 ] .",
    "we were able to place slitlets over all resolved sources brighter than @xmath42 within an impact parameter of @xmath43kpc at @xmath44 , and brighter than @xmath45 within @xmath46kpc .",
    "comparing to the characteristic magnitude @xmath47 at redshifts @xmath48 ( gabasch et al . , 2006 ) , these limits correspond to approximately 0.08 @xmath49 and 0.23 @xmath49 , respectively , for a sc - like @xmath50-correction . in table  1 , we present the photometry for all galaxies detected with @xmath51 within @xmath52kpc of the sightline at @xmath44 and/or with a slit spectrum from our observations , together with the determined redshift if spectroscopically observed",

    "( 2003)-corrected to @xmath59 , the effect on the colours is negligible . ] , we find that g07 - 1 and g07 - 2 are typical of bright galaxies , while g14 - 1 and g14 - 2 are considerably bluer than most bright galaxies , suggesting seds dominated by young ob stars .",
    "while we lack accurate dust - corrected sfrs estimates , all four of the galaxies clearly exhibit significant ongoing star formation . in order to compare our estimated sfrs with those of other galaxies at similar redshifts",
    ", we consider the sfrs corresponding to the characteristic uv and h@xmath9 luminosities ( i.e. , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) using luminosity functions at @xmath2 from the compilation of hopkins et al .",
    "we find values for `` sfr@xmath62 '' between 1.6 - 9.3  m@xmath63  yr@xmath64 .",
    "thus , galaxies with comparable or greater sfrs are relatively rare by number but account for a significant amount of the star formation density in the universe at @xmath2 .",
    "the results of our template - fitting suggest that g07 - 1 is quite massive , sitting above the knee in the galaxy stellar mass function at @xmath65 ( e.g. , drory et al . , 2009 ) , that g07 - 2 and g14 - 1 lie in the relatively flat part of the stellar mass function , and that g14 - 2 is a notably low - mass galaxy . combining the mass estimates with the photometry , we compute b - band mass - to - light ratios which we compare to models for bursty spiral galaxies by bell & de jong ( 2001 ) .",
    "g07 - 1 and g07 - 2 have m / l@xmath66 values as expected of galaxies with neutral b@xmath67r colours , while g14 - 1 and g14 - 2 have particularly low m / l@xmath66 values even for very blue galaxies .",
    "again , this implies that g14 - 1 and g14 - 2 are undergoing notably high mass - fraction starbursts .",
    "we can also obtain estimates of the rotation velocities , @xmath68 , through the tully - fisher relation using either the absolute b magnitudes or stellar masses ( e.g. , fernndez lorenzo et al .  2009 ; kassin et al .",
    "2007 ) , which , in turn , allow us to approximate the respective escape velocities , @xmath69 ( veilleux , cecil , bland - hawthorn , 2005 ) .",
    "we find @xmath70 - 800  and @xmath71 - 600  for g07 - 1 and g07 - 2 , respectively , and @xmath72 - 800  and @xmath73 - 500  for g14 - 1 and g14 - 2 , respectively .",
    "the mass estimates allow us to compute ssfrs for each galaxy , which are shown in table  4 .",
    "these can be compared to galaxies at similar mass and redshift ( feulner et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "the ssfrs for all four galaxies are among the highest at their mass / redshift ( see feulner et al . ,",
    "figure 1 ) .",
    "g14 - 1 and g14 - 2 are well above and g07 - 1 and g07 - 2 near the `` doubling '' line in ssfr , which is often used to distinguish between passively star forming and starbursting galaxies .",
    "the metallicities of each of the four galaxies are typical for their mass at @xmath32 ( savaglio et al . , 2005 ; maiolino et al . ,",
    "it is not clear how to simultaneously interpret gas - phase metallicities in  region determined from galactic emission lines together with those determined from absorbing regions at significant galactocentric distance .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that while measurements reported in the literature for `` typical '' low - ion absorption systems are largely metal poor ( e.g. , pettini et al . , 1999 ; meiring et al . , 2008 ; nestor et al",
    ". , 2008 ) , it has been demonstrated that gas - phase metallicity is correlated with  rew ( e.g. , nestor et al . , 2003 ;",
    "turnshek et al . , 2005 ; murphy et al . , 2007 ) , and",
    "those in  are expected to approach those measured in our galaxies .",
    "finally , the pc1 and pc2 amplitudes for each galaxy can be compared to the categories defined by these indices in figure  9 in wild et al .",
    "the points in that figure correspond to spectra of local ( @xmath74 ) sdss galaxies , which are dominated by light from the inner @xmath75kpc as the sdss fibers are generally significantly smaller than the sizes of galaxies at those redshifts .",
    "nonetheless , the physical interpretation of the principal component amplitudes ( i.e. , for categorizing stellar populations as quiescent , starburst , etc . ) is robust . and have pc1 and pc2 amplitudes placing them firmly in the post - starburst region of the pc1-pc2 plane , while and are firmly in the starburst region .",
    "notably , these results are consistent with the findings from each of our other methods described above .",
    "comparing these pc1 and pc2 values to the models (  3.3 ) , we find estimates for the ages for the starbursts of @xmath76  gyr for and , @xmath77  myr for and @xmath78  myr for .",
    "it is interesting that the star formation outbursts for the two galaxies in each field appear to be coeval .",
    "this strongly suggests that the starbursts are related to their proximity ; i.e. , triggered by an interaction .",
    "to summarise our observational results : ( i ) each field contains a pair of emission - line galaxies with @xmath79 , at impact parameters @xmath80kpc and @xmath81kpc to the absorption sightlines ; ( ii ) and appear to be fairly massive , bright galaxies ; ( iii ) and are also bright but less massive and have very blue rest - frame @xmath82 colours ; ( iv ) all four galaxies have high ssfrs and have metallicities typical for their mass ; ( v ) and are roughly 1 gyr removed from a starburst phase , though both exhibit ongoing star formation ; and ( vi ) and appear to currently be undergoing a starburst episode .",
    "we undertook the observations discussed above with the goal of uncovering the physical mechanism driving the extreme absorption velocity spreads that define  systems . in this section ,",
    "we test the star formation - driven galactic wind model in light of the results of these observations , and find abundant circumstantial evidence in its favour .",
    "we conclude the section by considering other popular models , and find tidally - stripped gas from interacting galaxies is also consistent with the observational results for some  systems .",
    "first , we consider the possibility that the presence of starburst galaxies in the vicinities of ultra - strong  absorption are coincidental . indeed",
    ", the existence of a strong  absorber requires a galaxy at @xmath83 .",
    "however , galaxies with such properties as we find for , , and are uncommon ( e.g. , bell & de jong 2001 ; feulner et al . , 2005 ; wild et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "similarly , the presence of a galaxy produces a likelihood of detecting a  absorber with @xmath84 , but  systems with @xmath5@xmath85  account for only 1 per cent of strong ( @xmath5@xmath86 ) systems , and those with @xmath5@xmath87  only 0.05 per cent .",
    "thus it is exceedingly unlikely that the ( post-)starburst nature of the galaxies and the ultra - strong nature of the  absorption are unrelated .",
    "this does not necessarily imply the starbursts are driving a wind that is responsible for the  absorption .",
    "for example , it is conceivable that they share a common cause , such as a major interaction stripping gas out to large galactic radii while simultaneously triggering a starburst , or that such an interaction channeled gas to the galaxy centers and fed galactic nuclear activity , which in turn drove the outflow .      the minimum rest - frame velocity width of a completely saturated",
    ", opaque  @xmath88 feature is given by @xmath89(@xmath5@xmath901)@xmath91 .",
    "for  systems ( i.e. , 3  @xmath92 @xmath5  @xmath93 6 ) , this corresponds to 320  @xmath94 640 .",
    "actual kinematic spreads are typically larger due to partially non - opaque profiles . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : targets ] , the absorber towards q0747 + 305 ( figure  [ fig:0747 ] ) and q1417 + 011 ( figure  [ fig:1417 ] ) have observed profiles consistent with @xmath95  , and @xmath26  , respectively .",
    "thus , the physical mechanism behind  systems must be one that is able to produce cool gas that , along a single line - of - sight , continuously spans many hundreds of  with a total dynamic spread of up to @xmath96  1000  .",
    "such a dynamic range can naturally be obtained along a sightline passing though a galactic wind at some angle to the outflow orientation .",
    "the impact parameters of the four @xmath79 galaxies in the present study are comparable to those of the general population of  absorbers ( see , e.g. , kacprzak et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "they are , however , at the extreme end of the @xmath11-distribution for  systems ( ntrq ) .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to consider the inferred velocities and timescales of the putative outflows in light of the distances needed to be traversed by outflowing material to cover the sightline to the qso .",
    "the observed absorption velocity spread arises from projections of the outflow velocity ( of sufficient columns of low - ion gas ) onto the sightline , and thus depends on the unknown geometry .",
    "however , order of magnitude estimates of the outflow speeds can be made by considering the red- and blue - most velocity extents relative to the galaxy systemic velocity ( e.g. , figures [ fig:0747 ] and [ fig:1417 ] ) together with a conic outflow geometry featuring opening angles between @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( veilleux , cecil , bland - hawthorn , 2005 ) .",
    "while such a calculation is overly simplistic , it should give an order of magnitude estimate for the outflow speeds which can be interpreted together with our estimations of the age of the most recent starburst .",
    "for the q0747 + 305 field , we estimate an outflow velocity of @xmath99 - 600  .",
    "this range is comparable to our approximation of the escape velocities for these galaxies (  [ sec : props ] ) .",
    "if outflows from both galaxies contribute to the observed profile , then the velocity could be as low as @xmath100  . at these velocities ,",
    "the gas would have to have flowed for a minimum of @xmath101 - 500  myrs to have reached the distance to the sightline .",
    "these timescale estimates are well below our estimate of a @xmath102  gyr age for the bursts in and .",
    "thus , the relatively large impact parameters in this field are completely consistent with a scenario involving outflows driven by the starburst event .",
    "the starbursts in the q1417 + 011 field are likely much younger .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig:1417 ] , however , much larger velocities are also necessary to explain the absorption . for an outflow to account for the absorption",
    ", we estimate @xmath103 - 1000  , which exceeds our approximations of the escape velocities . the velocity estimate changes little if both galaxies contribute , as they are at similar redshift and both @xmath104 .",
    "though rather large , such velocities are indeed seen in some galactic winds , especially at high redshift ( e.g. , pettini et al . , 2002 ; quider et al .",
    ", 2009 ; dessauges - zavadsky et al . ,",
    "this translates into minimum travel times of @xmath105 - 200  myrs , which is roughly consistent with our age estimates for the bursts in this field .",
    "unfortunately we do not cover  or other strong low - ion absorption features in our spectra of the @xmath83 galaxies .",
    "thus , we are not able to directly identify cold gas entrained in outflows via profiles blue - shifted with respect to the emission lines . however , we reiterate that strong , broad , blue - shifted low - ion absorption is ubiquitous in the spectra of star - forming galaxies at all redshift ( heckman , 2000 ; tremonti , moustakas , & diamond - stanic , 2007 ; weiner et al . , 2009 ; vanzella et al . , 2009 ; steidel et al . ,",
    "an example of blue shifted _",
    "ultra_-strong low - ion absorption in a galaxy spectrum is the well - known @xmath106 starbursting galaxy 1512-cb58 , with rews in and lines of 4.4  ( pettini et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "these features are generally considered signs of large - scale outflows .",
    "finally , we note that the incidence of  systems ( nestor et al .",
    ", 2005 ; nestor et al . , in preparation ) and the global sfr density ( hopkins et al . , 2006 ) show a remarkably similar fractional decrease from @xmath107 to @xmath2 .",
    "the cause and consequences of the equivalence of these trends are unclear ; however it suggests that  absorbers have some strong dependence on star formation .      for the  systems studied here , the associated galaxies have properties indicating significant recent / ongoing star formation episodes , suggesting a connection between the absorbers and star formation - driven galactic outflows .",
    "this is in contrast to the galaxies associated with the majority of weaker  absorption , which are found to span a range of colours and morphologies , with most considered `` normal '' galaxies .",
    "the physical nature of these absorbers is still an open question .",
    "traditionally , the absorption kinematics have been thought to arise from a variety of causes including rotating gaseous disks , virialised clouds , and accreting gas .",
    "as we have not _ directly _ observed a galactic wind in our systems , we must consider if the phenomena thought to be responsible for the absorption kinematics in weaker systems , or perhaps some other uncommon phenomenon , can lead to  absorption alone , without recourse to a galactic wind .",
    "detailed studies of disk - galaxy/-absorber pairs have shown that extended rotating gas disks likely account for part of the absorption kinematics in some systems ( steidel et al . , 2002 ; kacprzak et al . ,",
    "2010 ) . however , the projected spread in velocity of a sightline through a gas disk should be less than the disk rotation velocity .",
    "spreads in  systems are much larger than those expected for galaxies of the luminosities of our galaxies ( catinella , giovanelli , & haynes , 2006 ) .",
    "comparison of the neutral hydrogen gas density of galaxies with that of the cosmic star formation rate density reveals the necessity for continual replenishment of ( hopkins mcclure - griffiths & gaensler , 2008 ) .",
    "could the observed velocity spreads in  absorbers be due to sightlines through such condensing gas , e.g. , in streams or clouds of accreting cool gas ?",
    "again , it is difficult to reconcile the huge range in absorption velocity along a single sightline with accreting gas alone .",
    "a combination of a contribution from a rotating disk and accretion is more palatable for less - ultra strong systems such as q0747 + 035 .",
    "the accretion scenario , however , may favor finding the host galaxy in a pre - starburst or early starburst phase , whereas and appear to be in a post - starburst phase",
    ".    the large spread in absorption velocity may be due to the chance intersection of the sightline with multiple halos hosting less - strong `` typical ''  absorbers .",
    "this scenario has additional appeal for the two sightlines in the present study since they both contain a pair of galaxies at @xmath108 as opposed to the majority of the ntrq sample which have only a single absorber - galaxy candidate .",
    "this is particularly true for q0747 + 035 , in which the two galaxies bracket the absorption redshift .",
    "this scenario would be supported if the kinematics split into two or more distinct groupings of velocity components when observed with higher resolution .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have such observations for our systems .",
    "notwithstanding , insight can be gained by considering high - spectral resolution observations of other  absorbers , including  systems . in figure",
    "[ fig : uvesspecs ] we show the @xmath88 or @xmath109 ( as the red - most components of the @xmath88 lines overlap the saturated regions of the @xmath109 line in two systems ) transition for five @xmath110  systems observed with uves on the vlt .",
    "these data will be discussed in detail in an forthcoming paper .",
    "the rew of systems ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) in figure  [ fig : uvesspecs ] are dominated by a single , wide , opaque component , while the dominant component in systems ( a ) and ( b ) are strong enough to qualify as  absorbers on their own . while many intermediate strength ( i.e. , 1@xmath93 @xmath5  @xmath111 )  systems break up into multiple weaker components not resembling those shown in figure  [ fig : uvesspecs ] , some are dominated by a single broad opaque component .",
    "for example , c.f .  figure 2 of mshar et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , which shows the kinematics of a sample of  absorbers ranging from @xmath5@xmath112  to @xmath5@xmath113 , as well as a pair of  systems .",
    "returning to q0747 + 035 , could two separate weaker systems be the cause of the apparent  absorber ?",
    "the width of the absorption in the sdss spectrum implies a system dominated by a single opaque component (  [ sec : kin ] ) .",
    "thus , this scenario would require two @xmath5@xmath114  opaque single - component systems at just the right velocity separation ( @xmath115 200 ) .",
    "while possible , we consider this scenario to be less likely than the outflow ( starburst - driven or tidally - stripped ) scenarios .",

    "this conclusion is strengthened by the presence of galaxies hosting recent starbursts in both of the fields in this study . as we have mentioned above , however , it is not as clear that the starbursts are actually driving the outflows .",
    "tidally - stripped gas would likely also span a relatively large range in velocity and the interaction would be expected to trigger star formation episodes , making such a scenario difficult to distinguish observationally from a star formation - driven wind .",
    "the presence of two @xmath83 galaxies in both of the fields in this study is consistent with this scenario .",
    "typical velocity spreads in stripped gas might be expected to be of the order of the velocity dispersion of groups , where gas - rich major interactions are most common .",
    "although the velocity spreads of ( relatively ) modest  systems are comparable to that of typical groups , the strongest systems , including the system toward q1417 + 011 , exceed typical group dispersions .",
    "furthermore , we note that many  systems appear isolated in the ntrq imaging data .",
    "while those data are of insufficient quality to rule out minor interactions , which may in principle trigger starbursts , no evidence of the major interactions likely needed to strip large amounts of gas across such huge velocity spreads , such as distorted morphologies or tidal tails , is seen in most fields .",
    "regarding agn , we lack the necessary emission - line diagnostics to discriminate between starbursts and liner / seyfert galaxies .",
    "however , the 4000  break and balmer absorption strengths clearly indicate recent / ongoing starbursts . nonetheless , while the data and kinematics favour star formation - driven outflows over gas stripped from galaxies undergoing a high mass - fraction interaction or agn - driven winds , the latter scenarios should not be dismissed , particularly as an explanation for some fraction of the less - extreme  systems . either way , each of these scenarios involve outflowing gas associated with star - forming galaxies ; the primary difference being the energy source responsible for the kinematics .",
    "this work presents the first two  system host galaxies studied in detail selected from a statistically - understood quasar absorption line sample .",
    "we have shown that outflows driven by galactic star formation appear to be the source of the strongest  absorbers ( see also rubin et al .",
    "2009 ; steidel et al .",
    "significantly , these systems are identified _ without direct dependence on galaxy luminosity .",
    "_ thus ,  systems provide a method of tracing galactic winds  and thus high densities of star formation in the universe  selected in a manner complementary to , and without the biases of , emission - based methods .",
    "we have now collected imaging data for the majority of relatively low - redshift  systems in the sdss spectra through the fourth data release and intend to investigate the nature of the host galaxies using the entire sample . such larger studies are needed to accurately map the connection between @xmath5  and the detailed properties of the associated galaxies , which will provide important constraints on our understanding of the global evolution of star - forming galaxies . in this section , we discuss some of the implications of this connection .",
    "we have argued that the presence of the _ strongest _  absorbers is related to highly enhanced levels of star formation in galaxies .",
    "however , the connection between star formation and @xmath5  discussed by mnard et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is significant for  systems ranging from  absorbers down to at least @xmath5@xmath117 .",
    "usmgii absorber galaxies almost certainly have significant cross section for absorption at all @xmath5@xmath118 , and therefore are only observed as usmgii systems , as opposed to weaker systems , by the chance alignment of the sightline through the region of larger @xmath5 .",
    "( for the same reason , some fraction of systems observed as weaker  absorbers must also have significant usmgii absorption cross section . )",
    "furthermore , the intrinsic @xmath5-distribution exhibits the form of a single exponential above @xmath5@xmath119  that is featureless despite excellent sampling ( nestor et al . , 2005 ; nestor et al .",
    ", in prep ) , suggesting a common underlying cause for  absorption at these strengths .",
    "thus , it may be that _ all _ @xmath5@xmath120  systems are associated with galaxies that have experienced enhanced star formation within their past few gyr .",
    "strong  absorbers ( @xmath5@xmath120 ) are known to trace high - column densities of neutral hydrogen ( @xmath121  @xmath122 ) .",
    "damped ly@xmath9 absorbers ( dlas , defined as having @xmath123  @xmath122 ) , which have near - unity neutral fractions of atomic hydrogen and are generally metal - poor , have long been considered the reservoirs of cool gas for star formation . below @xmath124  @xmath122",
    ", subdlas exhibit a significant ionisation fraction and higher metallicities .",
    "rao , turnshek , & nestor ( 2006 ) investigated the relationship between strong @xmath5  and @xmath125 over @xmath126 , finding : ( i ) at a given @xmath5 absorbers span @xmath127 to 4 orders of magnitude in @xmath125 ; ( ii ) @xmath125 is not a good predictor of @xmath5 , although the lowest @xmath125 subdlas are predominantly @xmath5@xmath128 ; and ( iii ) the likelihood of a  absorber having @xmath123  @xmath122 correlates with @xmath5 .",
    "these trends fit the outflow scenario very well .",
    "the bulk of the in dlas is almost certainly associated with only a portion of the velocity profile in the corresponding  absorption .",
    "thus ,  absorbers and dlas are largely not arising in the same gas .",
    "as high ssfrs galaxies should also be gas - rich , a sightline passing through a star formation - driven wind may also pass through a gas - rich portion of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , that most dlas are not  absorbers is consistent with the fact that not all gas - rich galaxies having sufficiently high ssfrs to drive outflows .",
    "the relative contribution of  absorber galaxies to the global star formation density at any redshift can be used to infer the proportion of star formation that takes place at high enough star formation surface density to drive winds at that epoch .",
    "we can write this fraction as @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the average sfr in galaxies selected by  absorption , @xmath131 is the line - of - sight number density of  absorbers , @xmath132 is the differential proper distance , @xmath133 is the average cross section for  absorption , and @xmath134 is the global sfr density . at @xmath135 , @xmath136  m@xmath63  yr@xmath64  mpc@xmath137 ( hopkins & beacom , 2006 ) .",
    "we have an accurate measurement of @xmath131 from our sdss catalogs ( nestor et al . , 2005 ; nestor et al . , in prep .",
    ") , log(@xmath131 ) @xmath138 .",

    "figure [ fig : rho ] shows the values of @xmath130 and @xmath133 that result in various values for this fraction .",
    "we note that this fraction represents all galaxies having non - zero cross - section for usmgii absorption , regardless of whether it is actually observed as an usmgii system .    , for values of the average sfr in galaxies associated with  absorbers and the average absorption cross section for  absorption .",
    "the ellipse represents the range preferred by the data in conjunction with our model , though the actual uncertainties are unclear ( see text).,width=302 ]    the results of mnard et al .",
    "allow us to accurately compute the average  luminosity from  galaxies emitted at low - enough @xmath11 to the quasar sightline to fall within the sdss spectroscopic fiber used to obtain the quasar spectrum .",
    "this leads to a very firm lower - limit of @xmath140  m@xmath63yr@xmath64 . using the images presented in ntrq",
    ", we determine the fraction of galactic emission , on average , falling within the fiber to be @xmath141 per cent , or @xmath142 per cent when weighting by luminosity . finally , we determine the average reddening corrections for  from moustakas , kennicutt , & tremonti ( 2006 ) considering the typical luminosity of  galaxies in ntrq to be a factor of @xmath143 .",
    "thus , we estimate @xmath144 to 8  m@xmath63yr@xmath64 . this value is consistent with the uncorrected sfrs presented in this work .",
    "while it is lower than our inferred dust - corrected sfrs , we again note that the two systems in this study correspond to two of the brightest , highest-@xmath11 host galaxies from ntrq , and therefore may be expected to have sfrs exceeding the average for  systems in general . to approximate @xmath133 , we consider the distribution of impact parameters in ntrq and a bi - conic model geometry with a range of opening angles and base - widths , and account for non - uniformity of the absorption covering factor .- distribution with @xmath11 to @xmath30 15 or 20kpc in the ntrq sample is consistent with the average absorption covering factor being @xmath30 constant with radius out to this distance . at larger radius ,",
    "the covering factor must drop  but remain non - zero  out to @xmath30 60kpc , to account for the @xmath30 50 or 30 per cent of absorbers spread over larger values of @xmath11 . ] doing so , we favour values for @xmath133 of @xmath145 - 1350kpc@xmath146 ( c.f .  the approximation of @xmath147kpc@xmath148 in nestor et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "we show these ranges of @xmath130 and @xmath133 as the ellipse in figure [ fig : rho ] .",
    "the preferred range for @xmath139 is then 0.25 to 0.75 , indicating a significant contribution to the global sfr at @xmath149 from  selected galaxies .",
    "we caution that the above calculation for the preferred range of @xmath139 relies on untested assumptions about the absorption geometry and informal estimation of the uncertainty in the average sfr .",
    "thus , it should be considered suggestive until future work is able to better constrain these quantities .",
    "nonetheless , the results have interesting implications on the nature of star formation as a function of redshift .",
    "if @xmath139 is indeed close to the global value at a given redshift , it implies that the bulk of the star formation at that epoch takes place at high enough star formation surface density to drive winds .",
    "alternatively , epochs where @xmath139 is found to be only a small fraction of the global star formation density , @xmath134 must be dominated by relatively diffuse star formation . finally , if it were to be found that @xmath150 at any epoch , it would suggest a significant contribution from faint dwarf galaxies which are being unaccounted for in the current    or uv surveys yet have high enough sfr surface densities to drive winds",
    "we have presented a deep imaging and spectroscopic study of the fields of two systems from the ntrq sample of  systems . in each field",
    "we find that there are two galaxies at the absorption redshift having strong emission lines of , , and .",
    "the emission line fluxes indicate the galaxies are metal rich and have significant ongoing star formation .",
    "we employed sed template fitting to estimate stellar masses , which indicates relatively high .",
    "analysis of the 4000  break and balmer absorption strengths indicate the @xmath55 galaxies toward q0747 + 035 underwent a starburst @xmath30  1 gyr in the past , while those towards q1417 + 001 are currently in a starburst phase . it is extremely unlikely to find galaxies with such properties at the same location as the  absorption unless they are related in some way to the low - ion velocity spreads that define  systems .",
    "we consider various popular models for the nature of  absorption systems . given the ( post-)starburst natures of the galaxies , their velocities relative to the observed absorption kinematics , the burst ages , together with the impact parameters of the sightlines to the galaxies , we conclude that starburst - driven galactic winds are the most likely causes of the  absorption",
    ". however , a scenario in which gas is tidally stripped by galaxy - galaxy interactions which simultaneously trigger starbursts is also consistent with the data .",
    "while past studies have found blueshifted absorption in the spectra of galaxies at cosmological distances , identifying outflows in this manner unambiguously demonstrates that the material reaches the igm .",
    "finally , we estimate that the star formation density traced by  absorbers is , roughly , within at least an order of magnitude of the total global density , indicating that , though rare ,  absorbers are a powerful tracer of star formation in the universe .",
