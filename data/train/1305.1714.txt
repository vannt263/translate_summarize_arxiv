    "the diffusion model for the propagation of light has been used as early as 1922 by compton to describe the transport of light in an atomic vapor @xcite . soon afterwards , however , pioneering experiments by zemansky on the decay of the fluorescence emitted by an initially excited mercury vapor have shown a deviation from the prediction of such a diffusion model @xcite .",

    "these photons can thus propagate over larger distances and escape a finite size system with increased probability .",
    "soon afterwards , holstein proposed an integro - differential equation allowing us to describe the transport of light taking into account the distribution of step lengths of the photons @xcite . in the radiative transfer equation for the light propagation of photons at fixed frequency , this step - length distribution is an exponentially decreasing function , with well defined mean free path and higher moments . for the diffusion model to fail",

    "a similar model was developed independently a few years later in the context of astrophysics to describe the radiative transfer in stellar atmospheres out of local thermal equilibrium @xcite .",

    ", we report on the detailed experimental study of the length distribution of steps of quasi - resonant photons during their random walk in an atomic vapor .",
    "particularly , we measure this distribution in three distinct regimes : ( i ) the single scattering regime , where photons with the same frequency originating from a laser are scattered once outside the laser beam volume , ( ii ) a double scattering regime , where photons scattered once at @xmath5 have a doppler - broadened frequency spectrum before we measure their step - length distribution , and ( iii ) a multiple scattering limit , where photons have undergone many scattering events before their step - length distribution is measured . in the single scattering regime",

    "we show that in the multiple scattering regime , on the contrary , the emission spectrum converges to a stable one , i.e. , light `` thermalizes '' .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the step - length distribution after several scattering events allows us to characterize the transport properties .",

    "the image analysis uses a preprocessing stage aiming at removing biases and reproducible noise related to the imaging and the electronics of the camera , but also some non - reproducible artifacts .",
    "these procedures are particularly delicate for the images obtained in the last experimental configuration ( with three cells ) in conditions of extremely weak fluxes .",
    "the offset due to charges accumulated in a pixel during the exposure time or added during the readout is efficiently corrected by subtracting from the raw signal a `` dark '' image , taken with the same exposure time and with the laser frequency shifted out of the doppler absorption bands .",
    "possible stray reflections are also eliminated with this procedure .",
    "fluctuating noises can not be filtered out via such image processing . at room temperature ,",
    "the most significant of them is the thermal noise .",
    "its impact is limited by a peltier cooler , which keeps the sensor temperature at @xmath64c .",
    "the noise related to sources present in the system is here essentially due to the photon shot - noise and to fluctuations of the number of detected electrons due to the direct impact of cosmic rays on the ccd sensor @xcite .",
    "cosmic rays create locally important variations of the detected intensity , but the number of visible impacts on an image after a few hour exposure remains small .",
    "thus , if several images are taken , it is unlikely that several of them will have impacts of cosmic rays on the same pixels .",

    "although the suppression of thermal noise is less efficient than using all images for averaging , the obtained signal to noise ratio ( snr ) is sufficient .          if we neglect multiple scattering in the observation cell , the step - length distribution is simply given by the intensity along the incident - beam axis . in practice , we add the signals obtained in 30 ( experiment with two cells ) or 60 ( three - cell configuration ) lines of the ccd sensor ( 1.6 to 3.2 mm in the cell ) , and we average over the same number of pixels in the @xmath18 direction .",

    "indeed , at @xmath72c , the mean free path of the resonant photons is 12  mm and is comparable to the radius of the observation cell ( @xmath73  mm ) .",
    "however , the effect of multiple scattering can be corrected .",
    "indeed , the intensity measured along the ballistic - beam axis can be written in the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the intensity due to single scattering of ballistic photons and @xmath76 is the intensity due to multiple scattering .",

    "if we assume a smooth variation of @xmath77 on a distance @xmath78 small compared to the mean free path of resonant photons , i.e. , @xmath79 for @xmath80 , we can use the off - axis measurement to subtract the multiple - scattering contribution from the intensity measured on axis .",

    "light `` thermalization '' , i.e. , the convergence of the spectrum towards a stable one , should however occur in the case where the natural width of the transition is much smaller than the doppler one @xmath53 . indeed , a photon with frequency detuning @xmath125 can only be scattered by a very fast atom , with its velocity @xmath126 along the incident - light axis much larger than the width @xmath127 of the maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "its detuning after scattering is essentially imposed by the atom velocity along the reemission axis , statistically smaller than @xmath126 .",
    "the frequency of the scattered photon is therefore brought back closer to the atomic resonance .    in order to compute the evolution of the atomic emission spectrum with the number of scattering events , we consider a photon with initial frequency @xmath30 , submitted to a random walk in an infinite gas , and we compute the probability @xmath128 that the photon frequency is @xmath6 after @xmath129 scattering events .",
    "@xmath128 is obtained by averaging the emission spectrum over all possible scattering angles @xcite .",
    "as we assume the medium to be infinite , the photon can not escape and is therefore always scattered , regardless of its frequency @xmath6 at a given instant . using the joint redistribution function @xmath130 ,",
    "already averaged over the angles , and giving the probability that a photon of frequency @xmath10 is scattered and reemitted at frequency @xmath6 , we get @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the normalized absorption profile @xcite . in the simple case of two - level atoms with an infinitely narrow transition ,",
    "the joint redistribution function is given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "the normalized , gaussian absorption profile is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectre_gaussien ] ) .",
    "as expected , an emission spectrum with the same shape remains unchanged through eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectreevolution ] ) , which suggests that the measurement of the first - step length distribution previously performed gives a good estimate of the step - length distribution in the multiple scattering regime , due to the very specific selection of the first - scattering angle .",
    "if we take into account the finite width @xmath26 of the atomic transition , the redistribution function is    @xmath135 du \\ ; , \\ ] ]    where @xmath136 and @xmath137 is the voigt parameter @xcite .",
    "figure [ figurev12 ] shows the evolution of the emission spectrum @xmath138 , numerically computed from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : spectreevolution ] ) and ( [ eq : rii ] ) as a function of the number of steps .",
    "the figure highlights the convergence of the spectrum to the normalized voigt absorption profile , faster for frequencies close to the line center than for frequencies in the wings of the distribution .",
    "thus , after a few steps , the photon losses the memory of its initial frequency .    finally , we can take into account the multi - level structure of rubidium by averaging the contributions of all hyperfine transitions , weighted by their transition factor . including the inelastic raman scattering , we obtain @xmath139     that the frequency of a photon is @xmath6 , as a function of the number of steps @xmath129 . the initial spectrum ( light grey )",
    "is the lorentzian spectrum of the laser used in the experiment , at resonance .",
    "we notice that the emission spectrum converges to the voigt absorption profile ( dashed green ) .",
    "inset : same emission spectra , for an initial laser detuned two doppler widths from resonance ( 440  mhz ) . ]",
    "we thus deduce the evolution of the emission spectrum via eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectreevolution ] ) , and then the distribution @xmath140 governing the length of the step @xmath129 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mean_free_path ] ) , ( [ eq : p ] ) , and ( [ eq : sigma_gen ] ) . following the same fitting procedure as before ,",
    "we obtain the coefficient @xmath36 of the power law that better models the distribution @xmath140 in the range of distance experimentally accessible .",
    "the evolution of this coefficient with the number of steps is reported in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figurev13 ] .",
    "as the number of steps increases , the profile wings get broader and this coefficient decreases until it reaches , in the region experimentally accessible , a limit value close to the value obtained for two purely doppler emission and absorption spectra .",
    "due to the thermalization process , a single distribution @xmath0 governs the step length during multiple scattering in an infinite medium .",
    "the experimental configuration c3 allows us to prepare photons having undergone several ( typically 2 to 6 ) scattering events before we measure the step - length distribution , and thus to approach a measurement of the limit distribution @xmath0 [ fig .",
    "[ figurev13 ] ] .",
    "we measure @xmath141 this result agrees very well with our numerical estimate of the distribution @xmath0 of the step length in the multiple scattering regime in the distance range experimentally accessible .     with @xmath142 .",
    "inset : evolution of the coefficient @xmath36 as a function of the number of steps .",
    "the numerical result ( red dots ) is compared to the measurement in configurations c3 ( red triangle ) and c2 ( green triangle ) . in the latter case",
    ", a model without angular averaging is more appropriate ( green dot ) . ]",
    "the shape of the distribution governing the step length of the random walk of quasi - resonant light in a dilute alkali - metal atomic vapor at room temperature is entirely determined by the atomic emission and absorption spectra and evolves , with the emitted light spectrum , during the diffusion process .",
    "we have computed this evolution and we have shown that the step - length distribution converges to a limit law when the number of steps grows .",
    "we have also presented direct measurements of the distance traveled by light between two scattering events , first for the first step directly following the scattering of photons generated by a laser source , then for photons having experienced several scattering events and having thus lost memory of their initial frequency .",
    "the results are in very good agreement with our models taking into account , beyond the doppler effect , the natural width of the transitions and the multilevel structure of rubidium 85 .",
    "above all , they show that , in the distance range experimentally accessible , the step - length distribution in the multiple scattering regime is described by a power law @xmath97 with @xmath143 .",
    "thus , the second moment of this distribution diverges .",
    "consequently transport of light in the stationary regime can be described by a lvy - flight model .",
    "a few important questions remain open , notably related to the temporal dynamics of abnormal diffusion of light in an atomic vapor or to the impact of correlations between steps .",
    "most of known systems giving rise to a superdiffusive regime are spatially inhomogeneous , and the existence of these correlations is therefore inevitable .",
    "their impact on the transport properties may however be very limited @xcite . in atomic vapors ,",
    "correlations can be suppressed , provided the regime of complete frequency redistribution is achieved .",
    "addition of a buffer gas in rubidium cells may enable one to get close to this condition @xcite .",
    "it would affect the shape of the emission and absorption spectra , which could become lorentzian , leading to an asymptotic decay of the step - length distribution too slow to ensure that the scattering mean free path remains defined .",
    "finally , atomic vapors constitute a model system , of simple experimental implementation , that may enable the characterization of different regimes of abnormal transport .",
    "this work shows that the microscopic element constituted by the step - length distribution is as experimentally accessible as macroscopic quantities characteristic of the transport , such as the diffuse transmission through a sample @xcite .",
    "@xmath145 gives the probability that a photon of frequency @xmath10 , having been absorbed , is reemitted with frequency @xmath6 .",
    "we use @xmath130 as an intermediate quantity because this function is available in the literature for various broadening mechanisms .",
    "this expression of the redistribution function @xmath146 is given in @xcite .",
    "note that it is valid only in situations where the doppler width is large compared to the natural width , so that it is not applicable to cold atoms ."
