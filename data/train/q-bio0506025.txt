    "under a large range of salt conditions and temperatures , the double - helix is the thermodynamically stable configuration of dna @xcite .",
    "this stability is effected by the watson - crick h - bonding of base - pairs ( bps ) , and the stronger base - stacking of neighbouring , planar aromatic bps , that by hydrophobic interactions stabilize the helical structure @xcite . at the same time",
    ", double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) is distinguished by the ease with which locally the molecule can open up ( and later rejoin ) , to produce flexible _ bubbles _ of single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) , see figure [ fig1]a @xcite . the formation of dna - bubbles , despite the rather large enthalpy necessary to break the base - stacking , is made possible by the entropy gain , due to which the free energy for breaking additional bps is of the order of @xmath0 , after overcoming a bubble _ initiation barrier _",
    "@xmath1 @xcite .    at room or physiological temperature ,",
    "bubbles of 20 to 30 broken bps are created @xcite .",
    "dna - bubbles preferentially form in regions rich in the weaker at bps @xcite , and they are related to physiological processes such as transcription initiation @xcite .    traditionally measured in bulk by uv - absorption at elevated temperatures @xcite",
    ", it is now possible to probe the time series of the size fluctuations of a single dna - bubble ( _ dna - breathing _ ) by fluorescence correlation techniques in short , designed dna - stretches @xcite .",
    "these dna - constructs contain a well - defined ( at)@xmath2 breathing domain , that is labelled by a fluorophore - quencher pair .",
    "such a model system allows for a precise quantitative analysis , from which the parameters of the underlying theoretical model ( usually the poland - scheraga model ) can be determined .",
    "this fluorescence technique is being developed further to measure longer bubble domains , also at higher temperatures .",
    "it is therefore of interest to provide a theoretical model to understand dna - breathing in a homopolymer domain quantitatively .",
    "one possible approach is based on the master equation for the probability distribution to find a certain bubble size at time @xmath3 , from which quantities such as the mean bubble size or the bubble autocorrelation function can be derived @xcite . despite its mathematically appealing formulation ,",
    "the master equation needs to be solved numerically by inverting the transfer matrix @xcite .",
    "moreover , it produces ensemble - averaged information .",
    "given the access to single molecule data , it is of relevance to obtain a model for the fully stochastic time evolution of a single dna - bubble , providing a description for pre - noise - averaged quantities such as the step - wise ( un)zipping . with this scope , we here introduce a stochastic simulation scheme for the ( un)zipping dynamics .",
    "we use the gillespie algorithm to update the state of the system by determining ( i ) the random time between individual ( un)zipping events , and ( ii ) which reaction direction ( zipping , @xmath4 , or unzipping , @xmath5 ) will occur .",
    "we corroborate that the model recovers the equilibrium properties , and study the single bubble time evolution .",
    "the proposed scheme is efficient computationally , easy to implement , and amenable to generalization .",
    "motivated by the _ in vitro _ study of reference @xcite , we consider a dsdna segment with @xmath6 bps that is clamped at both ends ( figure [ fig1]a ) .",
    "a bubble state of @xmath7 broken bps is defined by the occupation numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the stochastic simulation then corresponds to the nearest - neighbour jump process ( figure [ fig1]b ) @xmath11 with reflecting boundary conditions at @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "each jump away from state @xmath14 occurs after a random time @xmath15 , and in random direction to either @xmath16 or @xmath17 , governed by the reaction probability density function ( pdf ) , that is relevant for consideration of multi - bubble states , simplifies here due to the particular choice of the @xmath14 . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the unzipping ( @xmath20 ) or zipping ( @xmath21 ) of a bp , and the jump rates @xmath22 are defined below . from the joint pdf",
    "( [ rpdf ] ) , the waiting time pdf that a jump away from @xmath14 occurs is given by @xmath23 , i.e. , it is poissonian .",
    "the probability that the bubble size does not change in the time interval @xmath24 $ ] is given by @xmath25 .",
    "the rates @xmath22 are based on the statistical weight for a homopolymer bubble @xcite @xmath26 according to the poland - scheraga model , with @xmath27 . here",
    ", we introduced the loop initiation factor @xmath28 for breaking the initially unperturbed dsdna ; the statistical weight @xmath29 with the free energy @xmath30 associated with breaking an additional bp .",
    "for the ( at ) domain ( with melting temperature @xmath31c ) , @xmath32 corresponds to physiological temperature , and @xmath33 to @xmath34c .",
    "we note that in single molecule stretching experiments the effective temperature can be changed by applying an external torque @xmath35 , such that @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the twist angle per bp of the dsdna @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq2 ] ) also introduces the loop closure factor @xmath38 assigned to the entropy loss for creating a polymer loop of size @xmath7 ; the offset by 1 is due to persistence length corrections @xcite . for the loop closure exponent in the rather short dna - segment we have in mind here ,",
    "we choose @xmath39 @xcite , although higher values have been suggested @xcite . requiring that the system eventually reaches equilibrium , the rates @xmath22 have to fulfil the detailed balance condition @xmath40 .",
    "this condition does not fully specify the rates , and we choose the specific form @xcite @xmath41 completed by @xmath42 .",
    "this choice assumes that the unzipping of a bp is limited by the boltzmann factor @xmath43 ( @xmath44 for bubble initiation ) , whereas bp - zipping occurs with constant rate @xmath45 , specified by the sterical formation of a bp ( to be determined from microscopic models ) .",
    "we start the simulations from the completely zipped state , @xmath46 at @xmath47 , and measure the bubble size at time @xmath3 in terms of @xmath48 .",
    "the time series of @xmath49 for a single stochastic realization is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is distinct that the bubble events are very sharp ( note the time windows of the zoom - ins ) , and most of the time the zero - bubble state @xmath12 prevails due to @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , raising the temperature increases the bubble size and lifetime , as it should . by construction of the simulation procedure , it is guaranteed that an occupation number @xmath8 ( @xmath51 ) corresponds to exactly one bubble .    to study the ergodicity of the stochastic simulation , we compare the running average @xmath52 of the bubble size with the ensemble average , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "note that in equation ( [ runav ] ) , we sample over the stochastic time steps @xmath55 chosen from the reaction pdf ( [ rpdf ] ) , such that we need to weight the individual @xmath56 by the time span @xmath57 until the next jump to @xmath58 . for long times ,",
    "the quantity ( [ runav ] ) is expected to reach the equilibrium value given by the ensemble - average , i.e. , @xmath59 . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , we display the time evolution of @xmath60 for two different stochastic trajectories .",
    "both approach the ensemble - average @xmath61 for longer times .",
    "relatively large deviations from @xmath61 occur , corresponding to a lumping of small or large bubble states .    in figure [ fig4 ] , we show the bubble size averaged _ exclusively _ over time steps @xmath57 during which @xmath62 , as a function of the statistical weight @xmath43 .",
    "as expected , the bubble size increases with increasing temperature , and the incorporation of the loop correction term distinctly reduces the maximum bubble size at equilibrium .",
    "the small error bars for the stochastic simulation data and the good agreement with the theoretical prediction @xmath63 demonstrate the reliability of the gillespie algorithm .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] depicts the time - averaged bubble size distribution @xmath64 for runs over a large number of jumps @xmath65 ( see below ) to ensure that equilibrium is reached : @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 is compared to the ensemble - averaged bubble distribution , @xmath68 , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this analysis demonstrates that the dsdna segment almost always remains completely zipped ( since @xmath50 ) , note the logarithmic ordinate . at room temperature",
    "the formation of bigger bubbles is a rare event .",
    "conversely , near the melting temperature bubble formation is significantly increased ( see also figure [ fig2]b ) . note that in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , we chose the ordinates such that they span the same range for the simulated parameter values , to facilitate easy comparison .",
    "again , small error bars and good agreement of the time - average with the theoretical ensemble - average are distinct .",
    "the gillespie algorithm governing our stochastic simulation therefore reliably leads to relaxation towards equilibrium , as it should , given that the detailed balance condition is fulfilled by the transfer rate coefficients @xmath22 .",
    "we determine the time - averaged autocorrelation function through the discretized form @xmath71 here , @xmath65 is the number of sample points taken over the trajectory , with sampling time increments @xmath72 .",
    "we chose @xmath73 .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] displays the bubble size autocorrelation @xmath74 as obtained from the stochastic simulation in comparison to the ensemble - averaged correlation @xmath75 ; the latter is obtained by numerically solving the eigenvalue provlem associated with the master equation , see references @xcite ) .",
    "both show good agreement . from @xmath74 , we conclude that at @xmath32 , the typical bubble lifetime should be of the order of @xmath76 .",
    "given the typical experimental bubble lifetime @xmath77 msec at room temperature , we extract that the zipping rate @xmath78sec , consistent with reference @xcite .",
    "to determine the random waiting time @xmath15 and the random reaction channel @xmath79 in the jump process ( [ eq1 ] ) controlled by the reaction pdf @xmath80 , two independent random numbers @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 $ ] ) are generated . in the `` direct method '' ,",
    "one conditions the reaction pdf in the form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the probability that the next reaction is a @xmath79 jump , given that the next reaction occurs at time @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the waiting time @xmath15 can then be obtained through the relation @xcite @xmath87\\right ) \\ln(1/r_1).\\ ] ] from @xmath82 , the direction of the jump is determined as @xmath88 , if @xmath89\\le \\mathsf{t}^-(m)$ ] holds ; otherwise , @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "a typical run would sample over @xmath91 to @xmath92 jumps to produce a single time series trajectory , where , in general , lower temperature requires longer runs . to ensure that equilibrium was reached in such a run",
    ", we checked that the quantity of interest reached ( almost ) constant values . for the correlation function ,",
    "about @xmath93 jumps were sampled at increments of @xmath94 . for the time - averages",
    ", we calculated the mean over 100 trajectories .",
    "by stochastic simulation based on the gillespie algorithm , we obtained the time series of the breathing fluctuations of a single homopolymer dna bubble , inspired by well - defined dna - constructs employed in recent single molecule fluorescence correlation experiments .",
    "the waiting time for a jump event corresponding to a single zipping or unzipping event defined by the reaction pdf is poissonian ; however , due to the boltzmann factors in the rates , the mean waiting time for a jump to occur can become quite long .    to corroborate that the stochastic simulation properly describes thermalization , we determined equilibrium properties such as the mean bubble size and its distribution from time - averaging , to find almost perfect agreement with the calculated ensemble - averaged values .",
    "we also showed that the bubble size autocorrelation function and the running average of the bubble size follow the behaviour predicted by the master equation .",
    "the stochastic scheme is therefore a reliable way to describe the bubble dynamics .",
    "computationally , the scheme is quite efficient , and it can be implemented in a straightforward manner .",
    "the major advantage of the stochastic approach , similar to the langevin picture in diffusion processes , is the possibility to sample single stochastic trajectories and thereby study the direct effect of changes in the physical parameters ( initiation factor @xmath28 , statistical weight @xmath43 , loop closure factor @xmath95 ) on the single bubble time series .",
    "this is particularly relevant as it is possible , with the current experimental means , to record single bubble time series .",
    "given the good convergence of the statistical sampling , comparison of dynamical data as obtained from our algorithm to experimental or precise microscopic simulations data will be an important way to explore further the validity of the poland - scheraga approach to dna - breathing , in particular , the exact value of the loop closure exponent @xmath95 and the bubble initiation factor @xmath28 , as well as potential corrections in the poland - scheraga model for small bubble domains .",
    "further advantages are the relatively straightforward possibility to include types of waiting times that are different from the poissonian , for instance long - tailed ones @xcite .",
    "the stochastic simulation is also more flexible to easily incorporate additional features such as the coupling to the binding dynamics of selectively single - stranded binding proteins to the fluctuating bubbles , sequence heterogeneity , or multiple bubbles , due to the formulation of an arbitrary number of coupled reactions in the gillespie algorithm .",
    "the corresponding master equation approach in such cases quickly becomes intractable , once the number of variables exceeds two .",
    "it may therefore be desirable to have available a stochastic simulation package designed for dna - breathing similar to the program meltsim for dna - melting simulations @xcite ."
