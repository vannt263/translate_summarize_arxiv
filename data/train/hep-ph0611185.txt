    "supersymmetry is a well - motivated way to extend the standard model  ( sm ) .",
    "most impressively , supersymmetry can stabilize the large disparity between the size of the electroweak scale and the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm  @xcite , the mssm , leads to an excellent unification of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 gauge couplings  @xcite near @xmath4  gev , a scale that is large enough that grand - unified theory  ( gut ) induced nucleon decay is not a fatal problem .",
    "the mssm also contains a new stable particle if @xmath5-parity is an exact symmetry .",
    "this new stable particle can potentially make up the dark matter .",
    "the main obstacles facing supersymmetric extensions of the sm come from the requirement that supersymmetry be ( softly ) broken . to preserve the natural supersymmetric hierarchy between @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,",
    "every mssm operator that breaks supersymmetry should be accompanied by a dimensionful coupling of size less than about a tev . however , for a generic set of soft terms of this size , consistent with all the symmetries of the theory , the amount of flavor mixing and cp violation predicted by the model is much greater than has been observed . instead",
    ", the experimental constraints require that the soft terms be nearly flavor - diagonal in the super - ckm basis  @xcite , and that nearly all the independent cp violating phases be very small  @xcite , or finely - tuned to cancel  @xcite . from the low - energy perspective",
    ", it is not clear why this should be so .",
    "a number of approaches to the supersymmetric flavor and cp problems have been put forward , such as adding new flavor symmetries to the mssm  @xcite , or mediating supersymmetry breaking through gauge interactions  @xcite or the superconformal anomaly  @xcite .",
    "these models also face new difficulties .",
    "new flavor symmetries typically require additional matter fields and hence the complications that go with them .",
    "gauge mediation generates flavor - universal soft masses and trivially small @xmath8 terms , but does not fully solve the cp problem , and makes it difficult to generate both the @xmath9 and @xmath10 terms with the correct size .",
    "anomaly mediation in its most simple form suffers from tachyonic slepton soft masses  @xcite .",
    "a more radical approach to the flavor and cp problems is to push the scale of the soft supersymmetry breaking scalar couplings to be much larger than the electroweak scale  @xcite .",
    "if this is done while keeping the gauginos relatively light , it is possible to preserve gauge unification and a good dark matter candidate  @xcite . of course",
    ", supersymmetry would no longer directly solve the gauge hierarchy problem if the scalar superpartners are very heavy .    another way to address the supersymmetric flavor problem , and",
    "the one we consider in the present work , is to have the soft scalar masses and the @xmath8 terms vanish simultaneously at a scale @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "if this scale is much larger than the electroweak scale , and if the gaugino masses do not vanish at @xmath0 , non - zero values for the scalar soft terms will be generated by radiative effects as the theory is evolved to lower energies . since the scalar soft terms thus induced are family - universal , the resulting soft spectrum does not have a flavor problem .",
    "the supersymmetric cp problem is also improved but not solved by this approach . besides the ckm phases , the only remaining phases are those of the gaugino soft masses , and the @xmath9 and @xmath10 terms .",
    "if the gaugino soft mass phases are universal , there are three new phases of which two can be removed by making field redefinitions  @xcite . the remaining phase can be eliminated as well within particular models  @xcite .",
    "near - vanishing soft scalar terms can arise in a number of ways .",
    "the canonical examples are the no - scale models of gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking . in these models , the absence of scalar soft terms is related to the flatness of the hidden sector potential that allows the gravitino mass to be determined by loop - corrections due to light fields  @xcite .",
    "a more recent construction that leads to near - vanishing soft scalar operators is gaugino - mediated supersymmetry breaking  @xcite . here",
    ", the mssm chiral multiplets are separated from the source of supersymmetry breaking by an extra - dimensional bulk , while the gauge multiplets propagate in the bulk .",
    "locality in the extra dimension(s ) leads to gaugino masses that are much larger than the scalar soft terms .",
    "small scalar soft terms can also be obtained from strong conformal dynamics in either the visible or the hidden sectors . in these constructions ,",
    "the conformal running suppresses the scalar soft terms exponentially relative to the gaugino soft masses  @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty with very small input scalar soft masses is that the lightest sm superpartner particle is usually a mostly right - handed slepton , which can be problematic for cosmology .",
    "this is nearly always the case if gaugino universality is assumed to hold above @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath0 is an order of magnitude or more above @xmath11 ( with gaugino universality ) , the lightest superpartner becomes a mostly bino neutralino .",
    "a viable low - energy spectrum can be obtained in this way  @xcite . for @xmath13 ,",
    "a neutralino lsp can be obtained by relaxing the requirement that all soft scalar terms vanish at @xmath0 .",
    "one such generalization that does not re - introduce a flavor problem is to allow the higgs soft masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 to be non - zero at @xmath0 .",
    "these soft masses contribute to the running of the slepton masses through a hypercharge fayet - iliopoulos @xmath16-term , and can push the slepton masses above that of the lightest neutralino  @xcite .    in the present work , we study the phenomenology of the mssm subject to vanishing scalar soft terms .",
    "we generalize our study by including non - vanishing higgs boson soft masses , as well as a higgs boson bilinear @xmath17 term .",
    "this does not reintroduce a flavor problem .",
    "inspired by grand - unified theories , we take our input scale to be @xmath11 , and demand universal gaugino masses at this scale . after imposing consistent electroweak symmetry breaking , the independent parameters of this theory , which we call higgs exempt no - scale ( hens ) supersymmetry , are m_1/2 ,  ,  m_h_u^2 ,  m_h_d^2 ,  sgn ( ) , where @xmath18 is the universal gaugino mass at @xmath11 , @xmath19 is the ratio of the higgs boson expectation values , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the soft higgs masses at @xmath11 , and @xmath20 is the sign of the supersymmetric higgs bilinear @xmath9 term .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ theo ]",
    "we motivate this scenario , and show how it can emerge in a number of different ways .",
    "section  [ mass ] discusses the low - energy mass spectrum of the model , the acceptable regions of parameter space , and the most important constraints on these regions . in section  [ dark ]",
    "we investigate the prospects for dark matter in the model , and discuss some of the potential signatures this might induce .",
    "section  [ coll ] contains an investigation of some of the potential collider signatures of the model at the tevatron and the lhc , as well as a discussion of the discovery prospects at these machines .",
    "finally , section  [ conc ] is reserved for our conclusions .",
    "while this work was in preparation , we became aware of refs .",
    "@xcite , which investigate the mass spectrum and dark matter prospects of gaugino mediation with unsuppressed higgs soft masses",
    ". there is some overlap between their work and the material in sections  [ mass ] and [ dark ] of this paper .",
    "however , unlike refs  @xcite , we allow negative higgs soft squared masses at the input scale  @xcite , and have a more extensive discussion of the phenomenological constraints . on the other hand , they consider specific details of gaugino mediated models , and discuss the possibility of gravitino dark matter in more detail than we do .",
    "our primary motivation for considering models with small scalar soft terms is data driven : they provide a simple and elegant reason for small flavor violations induced by supersymmetry .",
    "even so , it is comforting that this framework can arise from a number of theoretical constructions . in this section",
    "we describe some of these models , and discuss how they can be modified to allow for non - vanishing soft masses for the higgs fields .      vanishing scalar soft terms",
    "have traditionally been associated with no - scale models  @xcite .",
    "these models are attractive because the gravitino mass , and therefore the scale of supersymmetry breaking , is determined dynamically .",
    "the basic assumption underlying no - scale constructions is that the effective superspace khler density and superpotential have the form  @xcite & = & -3m_pl^2 + f(x ) + f^(x^ ) + g(,^),[g - noscale ] + & = & w(),where @xmath21 is a hidden sector field , @xmath22 represents a visible sector field , and @xmath23 is a holomorphic cubic function . with this form of the khler density and superpotential ,",
    "the tree - level potential along the direction of the hidden sector field @xmath21 is flat , the gravitino mass , @xmath24 is undetermined , and no soft terms are generated for the visible sector scalars .",
    "supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the visible sector by non - trivial @xmath21-dependent gauge kinetic functions , which generate gaugino soft masses on the order of @xmath24 .",
    "the one - loop corrections from the gauginos lift the potential in the @xmath21 direction and fix the value of @xmath24 to lie close to the electroweak scale , which is determined dynamically by the large top yukawa coupling  @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to maintain @xmath25 in no - scale models if there are other larger scales in the theory because of the radiative corrections these contribute to the effective potential for @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "if such large scales exist , such as in a gut , the heavy sector must be completely sequestered from the supersymmetry breaking , since in the supersymmetric limit , they do not alter the effective potential . within a gut where the higgs superfields are components of complete multiplets that also contain heavy fields , it is therefore essential to prevent these gut multiplets from obtaining a supersymmetry breaking mass .",
    "having separated the higgs in this way , it is natural to sequester the other chiral multiplets as well .",
    "this is the origin of the vanishing scalar soft terms in no - scale models .",
    "gaugino masses can be induced by a non - minimal kinetic function for those and only those components of the gut vector multiplet that remain light .",
    "thus if the higgs multiplets are components of a larger gut multiplet , of which some components develop gut scale masses , it is not possible to generate soft masses for the higgs fields without destabilizing @xmath24 . on the other hand ,",
    "soft higgs masses might be possible in more general unification scenarios in which the higgs fields do not belong to complete gut multiplets  @xcite .",
    "the form of the no - scale khler density and superpotential , eq .",
    "( [ g - noscale ] ) , is an input to these models .",
    "such a form does arise to lowest order in several string- and m - theory constructions , but is typically corrected at higher orders  @xcite . more generally , a superspace khler density in which the visible and hidden sectors appear as disjoint terms , as in eq .  ( [ g - noscale ] ) ,",
    "is said to be _ sequestered _",
    "@xcite . a sequestered khler density and superpotential guarantees that no direct soft terms are generated .",
    "this is a necessary ingredient for anomaly mediation  @xcite .",
    "complete sequestering can be obtained geometrically by confining the visible and hidden sectors to branes separated by an extra - dimensional bulk  @xcite .",
    "a partial sequestration can also be realized if the mssm gauge multiplets are allowed to propagate in the bulk , as in gaugino mediated supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "if so , the gauginos will develop soft masses through their local couplings to the hidden sector , while the soft terms of the chiral multiplets will only be generated by loops passing across the bulk .",
    "the resulting supersymmetric spectrum at the compactification scale of the extra dimension is therefore close to the one we are interested in : non - zero gaugino masses , and much smaller soft scalar terms . by allowing the higgs multiplets to propagate in the bulk , non -",
    "zero higgs soft terms can be generated as well .",
    "this is perhaps the simplest way to realize the hens models we shall consider .",
    "sequestering can also be realized in four dimensions through strongly - coupled conformal dynamics in the hidden sector  @xcite . even without strong conformal",
    "running , the contributions to the gaugino masses and the trilinear @xmath8 are naturally suppressed relative to the gravitino mass if there are no singlets in the hidden sector .",
    "this is not true for the scalar soft masses , which are generated by terms like d^4^_i_j x^x _ i^*_j , [ softmass ] where @xmath26 is the messenger scale , @xmath21 is a hidden sector field , and @xmath27 is a visible field .",
    "operators of the form of eq .",
    "( [ softmass ] ) can be suppressed relative to the gravitino mass by strong conformal dynamics in the hidden sector that couples at the renormalizable level to @xmath21  @xcite . if all such soft mass contributions are sufficiently suppressed , and if there are no hidden sector singlets , the visible sector is sequestered and the leading contribution to the soft terms comes from anomaly mediation . by allowing singlets in the hidden sector , both gaugino masses and @xmath8 terms can be generated that are much larger than the anomaly - mediated terms  @xcite .",
    "this is close to , but not quite , the spectrum we are interested in , because it is unclear how to avoid suppressing the higgs soft masses while squashing the rest .    a partial sequestration of soft terms , as well as an explanation for the yukawa hierarchy , can also be obtained from strong conformal dynamics in the visible sector  @xcite . in these constructions , there is a new gauge group @xmath28 that approaches a strongly - coupled fixed point in the ir .",
    "the mssm fields are not charged under @xmath28 , but they do couple to fields that are through cubic operators in the superpotential .",
    "as the theory flows towards the fixed point , the mssm fields develop large anomalous dimensions which suppress their corresponding ( physical ) yukawa couplings .",
    "since different ( linear combinations of ) fields develop distinct anomalous dimensions , related to their effective superconformal @xmath5 charges , a yukawa hierarchy can be generated in this way  @xcite .",
    "the conformal running also produces a general suppression of the soft scalar masses , as well as a hierarchy of trilinear @xmath8 terms that mirrors the yukawa couplings  @xcite .",
    "conversely , the gaugino masses are largely unaffected because they do not couple directly to the strongly - coupled sector .",
    "the third generation multiplets and the higgs multiplets must also be shielded from the conformal running effects to avoid suppressing the top quark yukawa coupling . as a result , the third generation and",
    "the higgs soft masses do not get suppressed .",
    "thus , the spectrum from visible sector conformal running is similar to one we shall consider , but augmented by third generation soft masses and @xmath8 terms .",
    "we expect the phenomenology of both scenarios to be similar over much of the allowed parameter space .      from the discussion above",
    ", we see that a hens soft mass spectrum can arise from gaugino mediation with the higgs multiplets in the bulk , or from conformal running in the hidden sector up to additional contributions to the third generation states . before proceeding",
    ", however , let us comment on our choice of @xmath11 as the input scale for the soft spectrum . in gaugino mediation ,",
    "the input scale is on the order of the compactification scale , @xmath29 .",
    ", is less than the cutoff of the theory . ] for visible - sector conformal running , the input scale for the soft spectrum is the scale at which the conformal running ceases , which we will also call @xmath29 .",
    "our motivation to set @xmath30 is partly conventional , but is also motivated by gauge unification and our wish to strongly suppress the scalar soft masses .    in both cases ,",
    "gauge unification can be preserved with @xmath31 , but the process will be more complicated than in the standard picture . in gaugino mediation , kaluza - klein states appear above @xmath29 and can lead to an accelerated power - law running  @xcite . with conformal dynamics in the visible sector , the sm gauge coupling beta functions will be modified by the large anomalous dimensions of the mssm fields .",
    "gauge unification will still occur , albeit at a lower scale , provided the conformal dynamics respects a global symmetry into which the sm gauge group can be embedded  @xcite .",
    "thus , in each case having @xmath29 below @xmath11 can induce an effective unification of the sm gauge couplings below the apparent unification scale @xmath32 .",
    "this is problematic for many gut completions of the mssm , which predict baryon and lepton number violation .",
    "typically , some additional structure is needed if @xmath29 is much smaller than @xmath11 .",
    "this motivates us to consider @xmath33 .",
    "it is clear that gauge unification can also be maintained with @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath29 is larger than @xmath11 , the renormalization group running from @xmath29 down to @xmath11 will induce non - vanishing ( flavor - universal ) soft masses at @xmath11 .",
    "the size of these corrections from running above @xmath11 depends on the precise @xmath35 completion of the theory , but even for minimal @xmath35 models they can be significant , on the order of  @xcite a & & c_a ( ) m_1/2,[abovemg ] + m^2 & & c_m^2 ( ) m_1/2 ^ 2,where @xmath36 is the gut coupling , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are dimensionless constants on the order of or slightly larger than unity .",
    "these contributions can be large enough for an acceptable low - energy spectrum to be obtained  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in both gaugino mediation and conformal sequestering , @xmath29 can not be more than about an order of magnitude above @xmath11 because the suppression of soft terms ( and yukawa couplings ) requires a separation of scales .",
    "let @xmath39 be the scale at which conformal running begins in the case of conformal dynamics , or the @xmath40 cutoff of the extra - dimensional gauge theory in gaugino mediation .",
    "presumably @xmath41 .",
    "the amount of suppression of the soft scalar terms from conformal running is expected to be an order - one power of @xmath42 , whereas the required suppression is typically on the order of @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "an even stronger upper bound on @xmath0 can be obtained if the conformal dynamics are responsible for the small electron yukawa coupling as in ref .",
    "the condition for this is y_e ( ) ( ) ^(_l+_e)/2 , where @xmath44 denote the anomalous dimensions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which are generally smaller than 2 .",
    "if we take this bound seriously , @xmath29 can be at most only slightly larger than @xmath11 .",
    "in gaugino mediation , flavor - mixing contact interactions between the mssm chiral multiplets and hidden sector operators , arising from bulk states with masses above the uv cutoff scale , are suppressed by a factor of @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "again this factor must be less than about @xmath43 to avoid various experimental flavor constraints , which translates into @xmath0 being within an order of magnitude larger than @xmath11 ( for @xmath48 ) .    given the above considerations , we will set @xmath30 throughout this paper , and not concern ourselves with the precise mechanism by which the scalar soft terms are suppressed .",
    "while beyond the scope of the present work , it also interesting to speculate that the breaking of the gut symmetry is related to the geometry of the extra dimension , or the escape from conformal running .",
    "such a construction would further justify our choice of @xmath30 .",
    "finally , let us also note that within particular models there is typically some residual flavor violation due to an incomplete suppression of the scalar terms at @xmath29 .",
    "the amount of flavor suppression can be close to the level probed by current experiments .",
    "however , without specifying a particular model , it is not possible to perform an analysis of the constraints due to flavor physics .",
    "thus , we assume as our starting point that at the scale @xmath49 , all scalar masses except those of the higgs bosons are precisely zero and that corrections to that assumption are inconsequential to the phenomenology discussed below .",
    "the essential features of the hens mass spectrum are well illustrated by a simple one - loop analysis . at this order ,",
    "the ratio @xmath50 , @xmath51 , is scale invariant for all three gaugino masses .",
    "if the gauge couplings unify and the gaugino masses are universal at @xmath11 , it follows that at lower scales q , @xmath52 ^ 2 m_{1/2}$ ] . for @xmath53",
    ", this gives    m_1 ( 0.43)m_1/2 ,  m_2 ( 0.83)m_1/2 ,  m_3 ( 2.6)m_1/2.[2:m12 ]    the one - loop running of the scalar soft masses is given by  @xcite ( 4)^2 x_i -8_ac^a_ig_a^2|m_a|^2 + g_1 ^ 2y_is , [ 2:msoftrun ] where @xmath54 depends on the soft masses and @xmath8 terms and is usually proportional to yukawa couplings , @xmath55 is the quadratic casimir for the representation @xmath56 under gauge group @xmath57 , and s = ( m_h_u^2-m_h_d^2 ) + tr_f(m_q^2 - 2m_u^2+m_e^2+m_d^2-m_l^2 ) , [ 2:sterm ] with the trace above running over flavors .",
    "at one - loop order , the rg equation for the @xmath58 term is particularly simple , ( 4)^2 = g_1 ^ 2s .",
    "because of this simple form , the effect of the @xmath58-term on the low - scale soft masses is to simply shift the value they would have with @xmath59 by the amount m_i^2 = -s_gut -(0.052)y_is_gut , where @xmath60 evaluated at @xmath11 .    neglecting yukawa effects ,",

    "for example , in msugra with @xmath260 , the ratio of @xmath261 to @xmath259 events is greater than four , whereas this ratio is close to unity for all five sample points considered .",
    "the ratio of the number of @xmath224 events to the number of @xmath262 events is also much larger in a generic msugra framework than it is here .",
    "this is the consequence of having left - handed sleptons lighter than the @xmath163 and @xmath164 states , which are in turn light enough to be generated by squark decays .",

    "the decay cascades initiated by the strong superpartners are frequently very long , involving several chargino and neutralino states . at each step in the cascade chain",
    "there is a chance of producing a lepton , and thus the total fraction of events containing multiple leptons is very high .",

    "[ 10 - 500-scan-3l ] , there is also a net decrease in the cross section , which occurs in the other leptonic channels as well . within this region ,",
    "leptons typically originate from decays of the mostly wino @xmath163 and @xmath164 states into left - handed sleptons and sneutrinos , which subsequently decay into the neutralino lsp .",
    "however , these left - handed states are only slightly heavier than the lsp , so the lepton emitted from the slepton decays tends to be soft , making it less likely to pass the lepton @xmath192 cuts .",
    "a particularly distinctive signature of the hens models are inclusive @xmath241 events .",
    "we find effective cross - sections above @xmath266 for @xmath110 and @xmath147 , which is sufficient for a @xmath196 lhc discovery given the sm background of about @xmath236  @xcite .",
    "there is a sharp increase in the @xmath241 cross - section in the small @xmath9 region at the upper right of the parameter space .",

    "furthermore , because the left - handed sleptons are lighter than @xmath267 but heavier than @xmath268 and @xmath269 in this region , superpartner cascades such as @xmath270 accompanied by many leptons have a non - trivial branching fraction and can produce three leptons from the single squark parent .",

    "the main difference that occurs at larger values of @xmath19 is that there is no small @xmath9 region .",
    "since the entire mass spectrum in hens models scales with @xmath18 , so too do the event rates .",
    "we have checked that for @xmath18 as large @xmath273 , corresponding to a gluino mass of @xmath274 , the inclusive event rates in all channels other than the @xmath225 and @xmath241 are large enough that a discovery with @xmath275 of lhc data is feasible . on the other hand ,",
    "the event rates become even larger for smaller values of @xmath18 , making discovery even easier .",
    "supersymmetry has been recognized as a viable theory of physics beyond the standard model for many years now .",
    "it was quickly realized that it was not only viable , but also potentially useful in the quest to understand stability of the electroweak potential , radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , grand unification , dark matter , and baryogenesis . in subsequent years",
    ", there has been much effort devoted to understanding how supersymmetry breaking is to be achieved without creating additional phenomenological problems , such as too large fcnc .",
    "there are two particularly simple alternatives that keep the good features of supersymmetry while ( mostly ) dismissing the bad features .",
    "one approach is to raise the scalar masses significantly higher than the supersymmetric fermion masses .",
    "this is the idea of split supersymmetry discussed in the introduction .",
    "one drawback of this scenario is the apparent finetuning in the electroweak sector .",
    "the approach we pursue in this article is in some sense the opposite of split supersymmetry . here , rather than introduce a huge hierarchy of scalar masses over fermion masses , we wish to zero out the superpartner scalar masses at some scale ( i.e. ,  splat supersymmetry \" ) .",
    "the simplest model of all scalar masses having a zero boundary condition does not work .",
    "however , applying a small alteration to the most minimal idea , namely that the higgs bosons are exempt from zero boundary condition requirement , preserves the good features of these theories , while satisfying the phenomenological requirements described in the text .",
    "this idea of higgs exempt no - scale ( hens ) supersymmetry has many phenomenological implications worthy of consideration at current and future experimental facilities . for example",
    ", we have found that the scenario can accommodate the tantalizing ( but small ) deviation of @xmath276 of the muon compared to the sm prediction .",
    "it also suggests a near maximal leptonic signal for the tevatron , and thus provides an excellent benchmark theory for the tevatron to either discover this form of supersymmetry or rule out large regions of parameter space in a clean way .",
    "furthermore , the lhc signatures are of many multi - lepton events .",
    "perhaps the most distinctive of them is the inclusive @xmath241 channel which can effectively rule out hens models up to gaugino mass scales that are uncomfortably large from the normal finetuning point of view . for the most part ,",
    "this form of supersymmetry is rather straightforward for the lhc to find .",
    "an important exception is the lightest higgs boson , whose mass is pressured in this scenario to be low , and thus perhaps close to the current bound of @xmath121 . given the difficulties of finding a higgs boson less than @xmath277  @xcite , discovering the higgs boson might be one of the more challenging steps in confirming the complete structure of this theory .",

    "<S> one of the most straightforward ways to address the flavor problem of low - energy supersymmetry is to arrange for the scalar soft terms to vanish simultaneously at a scale @xmath0 much larger than the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs naturally in a number of scenarios , such as no - scale models , gaugino mediation , and several models with strong conformal dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the most basic version of this approach that incorporates gaugino mass unification and zero scalar masses at the grand unification scale is not compatible with collider and dark matter constraints </S>",
    "<S> . however , experimental constraints can be satisfied if we exempt the higgs bosons from flowing to zero mass value at the high scale . </S>",
    "<S> we survey the theoretical constructions that allow this , and investigate the collider and dark matter consequences . </S>",
    "<S> a generic feature is that the sleptons are relatively light . because of this </S>",
    "<S> , these models frequently give a significant contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , and neutralino - slepton coannihilation can play an important role in obtaining an acceptable dark matter relic density . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the light sleptons give rise to a large multiplicity of lepton events at colliders , including a potentially suggestive clean trilepton signal at the tevatron , and a substantial four lepton signature at the lhc .    </S>",
