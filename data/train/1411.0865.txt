    "any description of physical systems bound by the strong interactions that deserves to be attributed as _ reliable _ should be based on quantum chromodynamics ( qcd , the quantum field theory that governs the strong interactions ) and should be of _ non_-perturbative nature .",
    "one formalism that  in contrast to , for instance , lattice gauge theory  offers the prospect of providing analytical insights , namely , in form of relations between features of hadrons and the parameters of qcd  is realized by the technique of _ qcd sum rules _",
    "their formulation proceeds along a well - established  sequence of steps :    * define the correlation function of a nonlocal product of operators ( in particular , of appropriate quark currents ) that interpolate the hadron under study , i.e. , have nonvanishing matrix elements between vacuum and this hadron  state . *",
    "evaluate this correlation function at the hadron level , by inserting a complete set of states , and at the qcd  level , by applying wilson s operator product expansion ( ope ) reshaping any nonlocal product to a series of local operators , to obtain perturbative contributions , represented by dispersion integrals of spectral densities , and non - perturbative ( np ) terms , labelled as `` power '' contributions , representing the `` vacuum condensates '' of the local  ope operators .",
