    "modern computer codes for stellar evolution calculations solve routinely a nuclear reaction network sufficiently large to account for all relevant nuclear transmutations .",
    "reliable nuclear reaction rates are a crucial ingredient for accurate modelling of the evolution of stars , especially for investigations of the chemical evolution of the stars and of the amount of processed material that is returned to the interstellar medium .",
    "such stellar model results are used for integrated models of the galactic chemical evolution , and for comparison to individual stellar abundance observations .    in spite of the obvious necessity to check the sensitivity of stellar chemical evolution predictions to uncertainties in the underlying reaction rates ,",
    "little work in this direction has been done recently @xcite .",
    "this is , in particular , true for the evolution of low- and intermediate mass stars ( @xmath5 ) which host important nuclear production sites and contribute significantly to galactic chemical evolution .",
    "two main issues make investigations of the propagation of nuclear reaction rate uncertainties difficult .",
    "one is the computationally expensive and numerically difficult nature of the advanced evolutionary phases of low - and intermediate mass stars .",
    "the second is that such studies are only useful if consistent estimates of the individual rate uncertainties are available .",
    "we have started a program to address this problem .",
    "in paper i @xcite we investigated the impact of cno cycle @xmath6 reaction rate uncertainties on the predicted stellar oxygen isotopic ratios .",
    "these predictions are important for the astrophysical interpretation of pre - solar meteoritic corundum grains @xcite . in paper",
    "i we used a monte carlo approach integrated into nuclear network post - processing calculations .    in this second study",
    "we focus on the evolution of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and their sensitivity to the rates of three key nuclear reactions : @xmath2 , triple-@xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we extend our preliminary results of this project @xcite , and provide a more in - depth presentation .",
    "the following sections describe : sect.[sec : astroback ] astrophysical background ; sect.[sec : npb ] nuclear physics input , its uncertainties and possible revisions ; sect.[sec : methods ] the physical model and methods of the astrophysics simulation , as well as the main elements of agb evolution that are important here ; sect.[sec : results ] our results as well as additional calculations with a second , independent code that verify the findings ; sect.[sec : impr ] new results for the triple-@xmath3 rate ; and sect.[sec : discussion ] results and discussion .",
    "after the initial h- and he - core burning phases , low- and intermediate mass stars evolve into double - shell - burning giant stars @xcite .",
    "these agb stars have a unique mechanical structure , as explained in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the electron - degenerate core with mass @xmath7 consists of carbon and oxygen ( the ashes from previous evolutionary phases ) and is about the size of the earth , while the envelope has on average roughly the density of water and extends to several hundred times the radius of the sun .",
    "this envelope is unstable against convection , and is thus well mixed .",
    "recurrent he - shell flashes , with periods of 5 to 10 @xmath8 are a characteristic of these configurations .",
    "a combination of partial degeneracy , the small geometric scale of the he - burning shell , and the strong temperature dependence of the triple-@xmath3 reaction rate leads to a thermonuclear runaway that locally generates power of roughly @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "neither heat conduction nor photon radiation are sufficient to carry away the energy , and the layer between the he- and the h - shell becomes convectively unstable .",
    "part of the energy released in the he - flash will do expansion work , cooling the layers above the he - shell .",
    "the stellar opacities in this region at the base of the convective envelope then increase , which forces the envelope deeply into the core ( in terms of the lagrangian mass coordinate , the enclosed mass ) .",
    "this penetration of the envelope convection zone into the processed core material below the the h - burning shell is the third dredge - up .",
    "the details of these events are well documented in the astrophysical literature @xcite .",
    "the dredge - up event is responsible for the transfer of nuclear processed material from the high - temperature stellar interior to the low - temperature stellar surface where it can be observed spectroscopically .",
    "this material is also blown into the interstellar medium by stellar winds .",
    "for these reasons , the strength of the dredge - up is of great importance to the observed chemical enrichment of low - mass giants and their role in galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the amount of dredge - up obtained in stellar models of the agb stars continues to be a matter of debate .",
    "it is well established that the dredged - up amount depends on the core mass , the stellar metallicity and opacity , the model of convection , and the treatment of convective boundaries , as well as on the numerical implementation of several details in the codes @xcite .",
    "earlier studies have already indicated that stronger he - shell flashes are followed by deeper dredge - up @xcite , and that a decreased energy generation in the h - shell leads to stronger he - shell flashes @xcite . however , there are no investigations of the sensitivity of dredge - up and the envelope abundance evolution to nuclear reaction rate uncertainties .",
    "we focus on the three reactions that dominate h - burning and he - burning respectively .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath2 reaction has the smallest rate in the cn cycle ; it controls the circulation rate of the cn catalytic material in the h - burning shell .",
    "the @xmath4 reaction is weakly active during the interpulse phase between the he - shell flashes .",
    "the most important reaction for the he - shell flash is the triple-@xmath3 reaction .    in",
    "double - shell burning around degenerate cores several competing time - scales are involved .",
    "the period of the he - shell flashes depends mainly on the rate of helium accretion from the h - burning shell .",
    "the strength of the he - shell flash depends on the geometrical size and on the partial degeneracy of the he - shell .",
    "a more degenerate and thinner shell results from a longer flash period , which in turn can be caused by the smaller energy generation rate due to a smaller cno cycle rate .",
    "in such a case it takes longer to accrete the required amount of he from the h - burning shell to ignite the flash .",
    "thus , one can qualitatively understand that the h - shell burning rate influences the he - shell flash strength , and thereby the subsequent dredge - up .",
    "the possible influence of the triple-@xmath3 reaction on the he - shell flash strength is perhaps more obvious .",
    "a larger rate is likely to cause a larger peak - flash he - burning luminosity , and subsequently a deeper dredge - up .",
    "our qualitative expectation is then that a reduced @xmath2 rate and an increased triple-@xmath3 rate will each increase the amount of carbon produced in the process .",
    "the effect of the @xmath4 rate is less obvious . to obtain quantitative estimates on these processes",
    "we have conducted a detailed numerical study .",
    "the nacre collaboration @xcite has recommended reaction rates for the reactions we consider here . in this section",
    "we examine whether , six years after their publication , the nacre estimates still describe the available data with sufficient accuracy for our purposes .",
    "table [ tab : rateselection ] lists the temperatures of interest : @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) to @xmath13 for the @xmath2 reaction and @xmath14@xmath15 for the triple-@xmath3 and the @xmath4 reactions .",
    "the @xmath16n(@xmath17)@xmath18o reaction has a complex structure with transitions , both resonant and non - resonant , to several final states contributing to the rate . in addition , contributions from the tails of subthreshold states must be considered .",
    "@xcite obtained data over a wide energy range from 0.2 to 3.6 mev ; their r - matrix fit to this data yielded a large s - factor for the transitions to the ground state .",
    "their total s - factor , @xmath19 kevb , was the principal basis for the nacre reaction rate @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "however , the fit to the ground state cross section required an unusually large value for the gamma width of a subthreshold @xmath21 state at @xmath22 mev in @xmath18o , about 7 times that of the isospin - analog transition in @xmath18n .",
    "such large differences are seldom , if ever , seen , at least for light nuclei @xcite . motivated by this fact , direct measurements of the 6.793 state s lifetime were made @xcite and yielded much smaller gamma widths .",
    "a reanalysis @xcite of the schroeder data resulted in a much smaller ground state transition and @xmath23 kevb .",
    "later , determinations of asymptotic normalization coefficients ( anc ) for the relevant transitions using nuclear transfer reactions , combined with some of the schroeder results @xcite led to @xmath24 kevb .",
    "recently , additional @xmath16n(@xmath17)@xmath18o data and corrected data from @xcite were analyzed to yield @xmath25 kevb @xcite .",
    "an independent measurement at tunl @xcite yielded @xmath26 kevb .",
    "measurements of the analyzing power at 270 kev @xcite indicate that m1 contributions to the cross section should be considered ; to our knowledge these contributions have not been included in detailed fits to the data .",
    "there are also preliminary data down to 70 kev @xcite for the main transition , that to the 6.79 mev state .",
    "all the recent investigations show that the ground state transition is small and that the resulting total s factor is smaller by about a factor of two than the nacre result . in the near future ,",
    "the reliability of the rate is likely to improve as more complete analyses including all the recent data are carried out .",
    "however , for now we have chosen to use an unweighted average of the four recent results and a conservative error reflecting the relatively long extrapolations to the astrophysical range , the neglect of the m1 amplitudes , and the imperfect fits to the data .",
    "we obtain @xmath27 kev b. for easy employment in the stellar evolution code , this value can be approximated as a fraction @xmath28 of nacre s analytical fit @xcite to the reaction rate in the relevant temperature range .",
    "the first step of the triple-@xmath3 process is the fusion of two @xmath29 particles to form a equilibrium concentration of @xmath30be .",
    "the subsequent capture of an alpha particle produces an equilibrium concentration of @xmath31c in its 7.65 mev @xmath32 state .",
    "occasionally @xmath31c is formed by a leak , via a gamma cascade or pair emission , to the ground state of @xmath31c .",
    "for the temperatures involved in the present calculations both of these steps are resonant and the reaction rate is given by :    @xmath33    the value of @xmath34 for the 7.65 mev state is known to within @xmath35 kev @xcite and contributes an uncertainty in the rate of only @xmath36 for @xmath37 . essentially all the uncertainty in the rate is due to the uncertainty in @xmath38 , the radiative width of the 7.65 mev state ; @xmath38 is known with a precision of @xmath39 .",
    "it is essentially these established values of @xmath40 and @xmath34 that are incorporated into the nacre rates for the temperatures considered here , and hence , for our purpose the nacre rates are adequate .",
    "we shall see , however , that they are not sufficiently accurate .",
    "following the completion of the calculations described herein , @xcite , @xcite determined the level structure of @xmath41  and concluded from their results that the 7.65 mev state alone adequately describes the reaction rate for temperatures @xmath42 .",
    "they also conclude that at @xmath43 , the midpoint of the temperature range covered here , the triple - alpha rate is smaller than the nacre results by about @xmath44 .",
    "this is comparable to the quoted error we used , and should be kept in mind when examining the details of the present results .",
    "in fact , our calculations can be used to determine the effect of the @xmath44 change on c - yields .",
    "this reaction has been the subject of many experiments and analyses over a period of forty years , but it is still not accurately known .",
    "it is not possible here to review this subject in detail , it is simply too complex .",
    "one can find a comparison of the various rates in fig . 1 of @xcite",
    ", and the references cited there can be consulted for more detail .",
    "a extensive discussion of this rate can be found in @xcite and the results of extensive recent measurements in @xcite .",
    "the nacre rate is probably somewhat too large in the region of present interest , but the quoted uncertainties are sufficiently large to represent the probable range of acceptable values .",
    "this is a minor issue for the present calculations since , as we shall see , carbon production in low and intermediate mass agb stars is very weakly dependent on the @xmath4 rate .",
    "we conclude that the nacre recommendations describe current triple-@xmath3 and @xmath4 data sufficiently well , at least for the temperature range relevant here .",
    "recent data , however , make it clear that the nacre estimate for the @xmath2 rate is high by roughly a factor of two .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     starting from our initial model at the end of core he - burning , we calculate seven full evolutionary sequences which end when all envelope mass is lost and the remaining stellar core is about to become the central star of the planetary nebulae stage .",
    "the sequences differ only in the adopted rates for the three reactions investigated here ( table[tab : sequences1 ] ) .",
    "one benchmark sequence ( et2 ) has been computed with the recommended nacre rates for all three reactions .",
    "in addition six sequences have been calculated in which for each of these reactions the rate from the fitting formula is multiplied by the factors given in table[tab : rateselection ] , which include the small differences between tabulated and fitting formula values .",
    "thus , for each reaction two sequences are computed , one adopting the upper and one adopting the lower bound of the uncertainty range .    in a second set of sequences",
    "we have investigated the influence of the revised ( smaller ) @xmath2 rate .",
    "we have considered also simultaneous changes of both this rate and the triple-@xmath3 rate ( table[tab : sequences2 ] ) .",
    "an overview of the reaction rate choices for the most interesting cases in which the @xmath2 and the triple-@xmath3 rate have been changed is shown in fig.[fig : overview ] .",
    "we summarize these results in table[tab : sequences1 ] and table[tab : sequences2 ] .",
    "the most salient features of these results are described by the efficiency of dredge - up , @xmath45 , and the yield of carbon @xmath46 .",
    "the efficiency is given by @xmath47 with @xmath48 the core mass growth between two he - shell flashes due to h - shell burning , and @xmath49 the dredged - up mass following the he - shell flash .",
    "for each flash @xmath45 indicates the efficiency of dredge - up .",
    "@xmath50 means that the same amount of mass by which the core grew between two flashes is dredged - up after a flash . the @xmath31c yield from thermal pulses and the accompanying dredge - up",
    "is given for @xmath51c by : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the initial and the final stellar mass at the beginning and the end of the agb phase , @xmath55 is the mass fraction at the surface as the star evolves and @xmath56 is the initial mass fraction .",
    "we also tabulate the total dredged - up mass .",
    "the chemical evolution of agb giants depends sensitively on the rates of the @xmath2 and the triple-@xmath3 reaction .",
    "calculations with a smaller @xmath2 rate ( case et8 ) show a larger dredge - up efficiency , a larger dredged - up mass , and a larger amount of carbon mixed from the processed layers to the envelope and a larger carbon yield .",
    "all these quantities are about a factor of two higher than for the benchmark case .    for the triple-@xmath3 reaction we observe the opposite behavior .",
    "the case et6 with a larger rate has , on average , he - shell flash peak luminosities ( not shown in the table ) that are 20 - 50@xmath57 higher than the benchmark case and accordingly dredge - up is deeper . the efficiency , total dredged - up mass , and the @xmath41  yield are about a factor of two higher for sequence et6 compared to sequence et2 .",
    "it is also clear that these effects are non - linear in the rates .",
    "the changes for increases in the @xmath2 rate and decreases in the triple-@xmath3 rate are small .",
    "the uncertainty in the @xmath4 as given in the nacre compilation rate has a much smaller influence on the observables studied here .",
    "we find that in both cases with upper and lower range values for this rate ( cases et7 and et10 ) the @xmath41  yield is somewhat larger than in the benchmark case .",
    "sequence et10 has a slightly larger @xmath41  yield than et7 although et7 has a slightly larger dredge - up mass and efficiency than et10 ( see discussion in sect.[sec : model - checks ] ) .    in table[tab :",
    "sequences2 ] we show the results for the revised @xmath2 rate and for cases in which two rates are changed simultaneously .",
    "the @xmath31c yield increases further for the lower @xmath2 rate and the combination with an increased triple-@xmath3 rate leads to still larger values .",
    "a compact representation of the set of simulations is given in fig.[fig : c12yield ] .",
    "the main result is that due to the revision of the @xmath58 rate the predicted @xmath41  yields of low - mass stars is about twice as large as with the old rate .",
    "in addition , the relative error of the combined effect of the @xmath58 and triple-@xmath3 rate has decreased .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath41  abundance is useful to further illustrate the differences . in fig.[fig : c12 ] the envelope @xmath41  abundance increases in discrete steps for all cases .",
    "these steps correspond to the discrete dredge - up events after sufficiently strong he - shell flashes .",
    "the astrophysical yield is obtained by integrating the surface abundance over the mass lost .",
    "most notable is the fact that @xmath41  abundances for the shown cases span a range significantly exceeding a factor 2 .",
    "until the reaction rates are better known this is an unavoidable uncertainty in the yield predictions .",
    "these results confirm our original qualitative expectations .",
    "a smaller @xmath2 rate leads to a smaller helium production rate and later ignition of the he - shell flash .",
    "this flash is then more violent and the subsequent dredge - up is more efficient compared to a case with a larger @xmath2 rate . more efficient",
    "dredge - up leads to a larger envelope enrichment , and thus the envelope @xmath41  abundance and stellar yield is larger for the run with the smaller @xmath2 rate . for the triple-@xmath3 reaction",
    "a larger rate leads to stronger he - shell flashes .",
    "in fact the run with the large rate shows he - burning peak luminosities which are about 20 - 50%  larger than for the run with the lower triple-@xmath3 rate . accordingly",
    "the run with the larger rate shows greater efficiency , deeper dredge - up , and larger @xmath41  abundances at the surface and in the yields .",
    "the main set of models has been computed using the evol stellar evolution code @xcite . in order to check these results",
    "we have repeated a subset of the numerical experiments with the independent msssp code @xcite .",
    "calculations were carried out for @xmath59 and @xmath60 with the standard @xmath58 rate used in that code ( very similar to the nacre rate ) starting from the main - sequence and a comparison calculation starting , as with the evol set of sequences , after the end of core he - burning with @xmath61 times the standard @xmath58 rate .",
    "this calculations shows deeper dredge - up and a larger c yield compared to the sequence with the higher @xmath58 rate .",
    "the effect seen in the msssp calculations is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the evol results .    in several test calculations we discovered that starting the comparison runs with different reaction rates at or even after the onset of the he - shell flashes did not show consistent trends .",
    "the luminosity of the h- and he - shell depend on the core properties ( i m particular mass and radius ) that are the result of the previous core burning phases of h and he . for the main set of comparative calculations we therfore choose an initial model about 20 million years before the first thermal pulse , and immediately after the end of the he - core burning .",
    "comparison calculations have been done with the msssp code with different @xmath4 rates . as with the evol calculations reported in sect.[sec : calc1 ] we were not able to identify clear correlations between this reaction rate and the dredge - up and yield properties of the models .",
    "the differences we found were below the @xmath62 level and more sensitive to numerical parameters ( such as the spatial and temporal resolution ) than the @xmath4 rate .",
    "( this is actually to be expected , because this reaction rate is not as important as the triple-@xmath3 rate during the agb thermal pulse evolution . )",
    "the quantities like total dredge - up mass and carbon yield are the result of a discrete process repeated @xmath63 to @xmath64 times .",
    "thus , these numbers are subject to a statistical fluctuation @xmath65 .",
    "the main emphasis of this study is the impact of nuclear reaction rates on the agb evolution , in particular the chemical enrichment through the third dredge - up .",
    "however , we did check how the dredge - up of models with different reaction rates change if run all the way from the main - sequence , including the effect on h- and he - core burning .",
    "one test has been done with the msssp code , starting a sequence with the reduced @xmath58 rate from the main - sequence . in that sequence",
    "the dredge - up during the agb thermal pulse phase is still significantly larger than with the nacre recommended rate , but the increase is somewhat smaller then for the comparison runs started after the end of he - core burning .    a second test has been made with the evol code running two sequences all the way from the zero - age main - sequence to the end of the thermal pulse agb .",
    "in addition to the benchmark case et2 we reran the combination of case et14 ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) , and refer to this run as et14a .",
    "we found that in this case the dredge - up is about @xmath68 larger than in the et14 model calculated from the starting model after the end of he - core burning .",
    "this is another example of the highly non - linear behaviour of the third dredge - up .",
    "we can analyse the differences caused by the change of nuclear reaction rate on the h- and he - core burning phases , and find them to be very small .",
    "the central temperature during the h - core burning of the @xmath69 models studies here are @xmath70 initially , increasing sharply to @xmath71 at the end of h - core burning .",
    "case et14a shows central temperatures throughout core h - burning that are @xmath72 larger than the benchmark case .",
    "this small increase of temperature is sufficient to increase energy generation required for hydrostatic equilibrium because of the steep temperature dependence of the @xmath58 rate .",
    "run et14a consumes h in the center slightly faster , and accordingly the h - core burning phase is about @xmath72 shorter than in the benchmark case .",
    "the mass of the convective core is practically the same in both cases .",
    "none of these nuclear reaction rate differences during the main - seqeunce evolution would make an observable difference .    during the he - core burning the slightly larger triple-@xmath3 rate leads to a slightly larger c / o ratio on the core ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "however , during the evol calculations some breathing pulses of the convective core occur .",
    "these breathing pulses are well known during the he - core burning phase and related to the unstable growth of the convective core into a layer that is stabilized by an composition gradient .",
    "the treatment of convective boundaries implemented in the evol code makes the occurrence of breathing pulses somewhat dependent on the numerics .",
    "it is not clear from the calculations to which extent the magnitude of the central c / o ratio depends on this simulation error .",
    "however , since the effect is small we decided not to follow this question any further . at the end of he",
    "- core burning the age difference between the two runs is @xmath74 of the total age .",
    "the core mass and size are practically identical .",
    "the second dredge - up decreases the core mass slightly for stars of this mass .",
    "this effect is weaker in run et14a , so that the core mass after the second dredge - up is slightly larger than in the benchmark run .",
    "it is during the early agb evolution from the end of he - core burning to the first thermal pulse that sequence et14a has a slower growth rate of the h - free core , corresponding to a @xmath75 smaller h - burning luminosity .",
    "this leads to a @xmath73 smaller core mass at the first thermal pulse for case et14a compared to the benchmark run .",
    "a smaller core mass should result in less efficient third dredge - up , if the reaction rates are the same .",
    "however , et14a has a combination of rates that increase third dredge - up , as shown in the main set of comparative calculations .",
    "in addition , because the stellar luminosity of run et14a is somewhat smaller , the mass loss according to the adopted l - dependent mass loss formula is smaller , and the thermal pulse agb phase is longer by @xmath76 . in particular the last thermal pulses have larger he - flash peak luminosity , that as discussed above leads to more efficient dredge - up .",
    "the third test concerns the influence of the @xmath4 rate on the pre - agb evolution .",
    "we calculated an additional sequence ( et7a ) corresponding to sequence et7 ( nacre rate times 1.44 ) from the main - sequence to the thermal pulse agb phase .",
    "as can be expected , there are no difference ( e.g. duration , core size ) between run et7a and et2a during the h - core burning phase . during the core he - burning phase",
    "the central c / o ratio is systematically smaller in run et7a compared to the benchmark case .",
    "for example after 1/3 of the he - core burning phase @xmath77 for the et7a run and @xmath78 for the benchmark case . not surprisingly",
    "the ratio of those two values is 1.44 .",
    "the et2a he - core burning duration is @xmath75 shorter than et7a , the central temperature and density are almost the same . as in the discussion of run et14a above we note the occurence of breathing pulses during the he - core burning phase , in particular towards the end of this phase . in runs et2a and et7a",
    "these breathing pulses are very similar , with no observable difference .",
    "the core mass at the first thermal pulse is @xmath79 for et7a , and practically the same ( @xmath80 ) for et2a .",
    "we continued run et7a into the thermal pulse regime until the onset of the third dredge - up . as expected from the practically idenitical core masses the et7a and et2a sequence show very similar third dredge - up behaviour .",
    "in conclusion we find that as expected the sensitivity of stellar evolution properties to the @xmath4 rate during the h- and he - core burning phases of low - mass stars are small .",
    "there is a small dependence of the thermal pulse agb results on the progenitor evolution , which however does not change the trends established with our main set of comparative calculations starting with the same initial model after the end of he - core burning .",
    "the recent results of @xcite , @xcite have shown that for @xmath81 , the triple alpha reaction rate is dependent essentially on the properties of the @xmath32 state at an excitation energy 7.65 mev in @xmath41 , the hoyle state .",
    "this reduces the problem of determining the triple alpha rate to determining the properties of that state .",
    "because the 7.65 mev state is a @xmath32 state its direct excitation is difficult .",
    "moreover , the ratio of the radiative width to the total width is small , @xmath82 . as a result one must determine @xmath38 from the relationship @xmath83 here @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the gamma width , pair width and total width of the 7.65 mev state .",
    "each of the three factors on the right is determined in a separate experiment . at present",
    "they are known with an accuracy , left to right , of @xmath87 , and @xmath88 . in all cases ,",
    "there are several consistent measurements , so these results can be regarded as robust .",
    "there are two new developments that may significantly improve our knowledge of @xmath38 , and hence the triple-@xmath3 reaction rate , by improving the accuracy of the poorest known quantities : the pair width @xmath89 and the pair branch @xmath90 .",
    "the pair width is determined from the transition charge density for inelastic electron scattering to the 7.6  mev state .",
    "there is a new , as yet unpublished result @xcite , based on a compendium of extant measurements over a large momentum transfer range , that has a quoted accuracy of @xmath91 .",
    "it is difficult to imagine that a more accurate value of @xmath89 can be obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "this value is not quite consistent with the earlier values of @xmath89 .",
    "the pair branch @xmath90 is the least well known quantity , primarily because it is so small , about @xmath92 .",
    "a new experiment @xcite , a western michigan university ( wmu ) , michigan state university ( msu ) collaboration , is underway using the tandem accelerator at wmu .",
    "the proposed detector is an improved version of that used by @xcite .    in this experiment the 7.6  mev state in @xmath31c",
    "is excited by inelastic proton scattering , taking advantage of a strong resonance at an excitation energy of 10.6 mev and a scattering angle of 135 degrees in the lab . in order to reduce gamma ray backgrounds ,",
    "a coincidence is required between a thin plastic- scintillator cylinder surrounding the target and a large plastic scintillator surrounding both the target and the cylinder .",
    "this arrangement should strongly discriminate against @xmath93 ray - backgrounds  gamma rays have only small probability of interacting in the thin cylinder .",
    "the pair branch is then given simply by the ratio of the number of positron - electron pairs detected by plastic scintillator coincidences to the number of counts in the 7.65  mev peak in the proton spectrum .",
    "an examination of the systematic uncertainties in the similar robertson experiment leads us to estimate that an accuracy of 5% is achievable .",
    "these two results promise to reduce the uncertainty in the triple-@xmath3 rate to about 6% ; as we have seen that will greatly improve the reliability of predictions of carbon production in agb stars .",
    "we have presented a systematic investigation of the propagation of the rate uncertainties of key nuclear reaction rates into chemical enrichment predictions of low- and intermediate mass stars that have reached the thermal pulse agb phase .",
    "we found that the dredge - up in low - mass stars depends rather sensitively on the adopted reaction rates .",
    "the overall dredge - up of material and , specifically , the yield of @xmath31c , has uncertainties of greater than a factor of two owing to the reaction rate uncertainties .",
    "the c / o ratio at the stellar surface has a similar uncertainty .",
    "such uncertainties are a problem for many problems of current astrophysical interest .",
    "the construction of integrated models of galactic chemical evolution , for example , includes contributions from stars of all initial masses @xcite , and agb stars are an important contributor for some nuclear species .",
    "the enrichment of the surface abundance with carbon also effects the appearance of agb stars in extra - galactic stellar population studies . as the surface abundance changes from o - dominated ( @xmath94 ) , to c - rich ( @xmath95 ) the molecular chemistry in the giant s atmosphere changes considerably @xcite , affecting the star s surface temperature and thereby its astronomical colors .",
    "in older extra - galactic populations agb stars are often the brightest stars , and can probe the population s properties , for example , its age . finally , many extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars , which may provide information on chemical evolution in the early universe , turn out to have binary white dwarf companions @xcite .",
    "the unusual abundance patterns of these emp stars @xcite should correlate with the chemical yields of the white dwarf progenitors - the agb stars at this low metallicity .",
    "of course nuclear reaction rates are not the only uncertainties in agb models .",
    "the treatment of convection , and mixing in general , effects the efficiency of the third dredge - up as well @xcite .",
    "two separate issues have to be considered .",
    "convection in 1d stellar evolution models is usually approximated by some variant of the local mixing - length theory @xcite.in this ballistic theory the mean free path of rising and descending blobs has to be specified . based on the sparse information on this topic in the literature @xcite",
    "we roughly estimate that the mixing - length uncertainty translates into yield uncertainties ranging from @xmath96 to a factor of a few , depending on initial stellar mass .",
    "another source of uncertainty of dredge - up predictions is the treatment of convective overshooting .",
    "there is now enough numerical and experimental proof to claim that convective overshooting takes place in stellar environments , and that the efficiency of that process depends on the evolutionary phase @xcite .",
    "it appears that dredge - up predictions are uncertain by a factor of two because of the poorly known overshooting efficiency .",
    "these two issues related to the modelling of stellar convection have been viewed as the major source of dredge - up and yield prediction uncertainties .",
    "our study shows that nuclear reaction rate uncertainties of two key reactions induce modelling uncertainties of similar magnitude .",
    "the need to reduce these uncertainties is a powerful argument for better determinations of the reaction rates of the @xmath2 and triple-@xmath3 reactions .",
    "progress in experimental nuclear physics will have an immediate impact on astrophysical models that rely on stellar yields .",
    "similar to fig.[fig : t - m - et2-long ] , but only for the agb phase with he - shell flashes .",
    "the inset shows the detail of an individual dredge - up event .",
    "the inset mass - range shown is from @xmath97 to @xmath98 and the time - range is from @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "more details of agb evolution is given in the review article by @xcite ]     evolution of the @xmath41  and @xmath101  ( in mass fraction ) in the envelope ( i.e. , at the surface ) as a function of total stellar mass ( sequence et13 ) .",
    "since the total stellar mass decreases with time the figure shows the time evolution of the envelope @xmath41  abundance . the intershell material that is dredged - up to the envelope contains more c than o , which eventually leads to c - star formation ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "integration of the surface abundance over the mass lost gives the @xmath41  yields . ]"
