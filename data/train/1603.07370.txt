    "with growing competition in the silicon industry , there is an increasing need to conceal the functionality of a circuit design .",
    "this is due to the increasing use of reverse engineering by competitors , both foreign and domestic , aimed at stealing hardware intellectual property ( ip ) .",
    "reverse engineering of a product can lead to companies loosing competitive advantages and losing market share to counterfeit products .",
    "it has been estimated that counterfeit products cost the semiconductor industry $ 4 billion a year @xcite .",
    "examples of counterfeit products in such systems include airplane landing lights , radiation detectors , automotive breaking systems and defibrillators @xcite .",
    "the consequences of using counterfeit chips include the premature failure of critical systems .",
    "this is due to counterfeit chips that are manufactured cheaper and at a lower quality than the original .",
    "because of this , there is a need for innovative solutions to protect hardware ip from reverse engineering . to combat these counterfeit parts",
    "many industries have adopted standards of manufacturing to minimize counterfeiting @xcite .      by reverse",
    "engineering an integrated circuit ( ic ) counterfeiters can gain insight into the design of the circuit . reverse engineering",
    "itself has become a major challenge for counterfeiters due to the high cost and time required to reverse engineer sub - micron circuits .",
    "one can reverse engineer an ic by learning the circuitry of the chip through optical imaging or the use of a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) @xcite . in this process of each layer of the chip",
    "is removed one at a time and a picture is taken of that layer . due to the variety of different feature sizes in modern ics ,",
    "many different techniques are used today to remove each layer .",
    "these techniques include dry etching , wet etching and polishing of the chip .",
    "each image will show the electrical connections in that layer . by assembling the images ,",
    "it is possible to reveal all electrical connections that constitute the chip .",
    "there is commercial software available that can aid in the reconstruction of the electrical connections from sem images .",
    "this software can export spice level netlists for simulation of the ic @xcite .    to combat reverse engineering , researchers have come up with many different circuit level defenses .",
    "these defenses can be separated into two different types : non - obfuscated and obfuscated defenses .",
    "a non - obfuscated defense is an approach where an attacker can still see the functionality of the chip .",
    "however , if they did reproduce the chip it could be detected as a counterfeit .",
    "an obfuscated defense is where an attacker can not learn the functionality of the chip .",
    "the approach presented in this paper is an obfuscated defense .",
    "a non - obfuscated defense can be viewed as a watermark or fingerprint , where a unique structure is added to the hardware to prove the identity of the intellectual property ( ip ) @xcite .",
    "the difference between the two is a watermark is added to identify the designer and a fingerprint is added to identify the buyer @xcite . using this approach an attacker may be able to see the functionality of the chip , but may not be able to duplicate it .",
    "this watermark or fingerprint can include a hidden feature in the datapath , control path , or a hidden layout feature that is hard to duplicate .",
    "one solution is to add sheets of m1 to the filler cells . by doing so ,",
    "the cells become highly reflective when the chip is illuminated @xcite . as",
    "this may be a detail that counterfeiters overlook , the reflectivity of the chip can be used to determine counterfeiting and detection of trojans . any extra hardware added by the fab will cause the surface to be less reflective , as there will be fewer filler cells .",
    "another watermarking approach is to include a unique number of clock buffers in the synthesis of the chip @xcite . in doing so , if someone reverse engineers the chip and attempts to make a counterfeit , the number of buffers could be different .",
    "this is because clock buffers are automatically added by the synthesis tool .",
    "therefore , the number of clock buffers can be used to identify a counterfeit chip .",
    "as both of these methods are passive , there is no additional area or power cost for watermarking or fingerprinting .    a more advanced watermarking , or fingerprinting strategy is to add some functionality that is physically uncloneable .",
    "these circuits are called physically uncloneable functions ( puf ) .",
    "they work by creating a circuit where the functionality is highly dependent upon process variations and is therefore very hard to reproduce .",
    "if the circuit is reverse engineered and cloned , it will not work due to differences in the process variations .",
    "an obvious candidate for a puf is a ring of an even number of inverters , as it will settle at a 1 or a 0 depending upon process variations , if it is not programmed  @xcite .",
    "the output is measured , the circuit is reset and the output is measured again .",
    "a golden distribution of outputs will be generated .",
    "when , an unverified chip is measured , the distribution of outputs should be similar . if it is not , than the circuit is a counterfeit .",
    "this is because the output of an uninitialized memory element is a function of the parasitics .",
    "so as long as the parasitics are the same from device to device , the distribution of outputs for the uninitialized memory element should be the same .",
    "therefore , an attacker may be able to counterfeit the chip , but the puf will act as a watermark .",
    "the other class of circuit level defenses is obfuscated defenses , in which an attacker may not be able to reverse engineer the functionality of the chip .",
    "one approach of this type is to make the layouts of all of the standard cells the same , so that a nor gate looks identical to a nand gate .",
    "this is done through hiding the connections in between transistors .",
    "this can be done by using false vias between layers  @xcite to hide connections .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that it requires a special manufacturing process for the false vias and increases the capacitance among wires .",
    "this approach substantially increases the power , delay and area of the cell library by approximately 500% , 150% and 400% respectively .",
    "because of this , the authors propose only obfuscating 5% of the total gates in a large design .",
    "the total circuit overhead was approximately 80% increase in power , 70% increase in area and 50% increase in delay for the iscas test circuits .",
    "another method to conceal connections is through adding connections through diffusion @xcite . by doing so",
    ", one can create inverters that are stuck at a logic one , or a logic zero . using these obfuscated inverters",
    ", one can hide the true number of inputs into a function .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is a large increase in area and delay .",
    "one paper reported that this approach increased the area by 587% and the delay by 250% @xcite .",
    "other non - hardware defenses include the use of _ software keys _ to define the datapath flow @xcite .",
    "a software key is a control signal that changes the control flow of a datapath .",
    "the software key can be a selector bit for a mux @xcite , or a lookup table @xcite , or an xor gate @xcite .",
    "this approach increases the area by an average of 0.63% and the power by 2.6% @xcite .",
    "the overhead was so low because the authors only obfuscated 5% of the total number of cells in the design .",
    "one of the most secure ways to obfuscate a function is by selectively changing the threshold voltage of certain transistors .",
    "since the threshold voltage depends upon the gate oxide thickness , it is very difficult to detect changes in @xmath1 through sem images .",
    "this approach has been used previously to obfuscate standard cells at the expense of static dc current  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the logical inputs are made to a pmos pull up network .",
    "the threshold voltage of the nmos pull down network is varied to create either a nand , or a nor gate . in this paper",
    "we expand on this idea to obfuscate larger logical functions , by varying @xmath1 and without creating dc currents or degrading performance or area or power .",
    "the remainder of this paper is divided up into the following sections .",
    "section ii gives a brief introduction to threshold logic and the circuit level implementation of a threshold logic gate ( tlg ) .",
    "section iii shows cell level obfuscation and compares obfuscated and nonobfuscated threshold gates to their cmos counterparts .",
    "the functions used for comparison are a 3-input and function and a 3-input xor function .",
    "section iv uses the obfuscated cell library proposed in section iii to build larger circuits .",
    "an obfuscated wallace tree multiplier and an obfuscated fir filter are synthesized and placed and routed .",
    "the circuits are compared to their nonobfuscated cmos counterparts for comparison of area and power .",
    "section v draws conclusions on the obfuscated cells and wraps up the paper .",
    "threshold logic is a subset of boolean logic .",
    "a boolean logic function is defined as a threshold logic function if the function @xmath3 along with its associated weights @xmath4 and threshold @xmath5 satisfy    @xmath6    where the weights @xmath7 , the threshold @xmath5 are integers and the inputs @xmath8 are boolean variables .",
    "a threshold function will be represented as @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "boolean threshold functions can be determined through binary decision diagrams @xcite .",
    "circuit implementation of threshold logic has been the focus of much research @xcite .",
    "it has been previously shown that by implementing logic with threshold cells , one can save area and power , compared to their cmos counterpart .      a circuit that evaluates equation [ eq_threshold_fn_def ] this paper will refer to as a threshold logic gate ( tlg ) .",
    "a tlg will make a comparison between @xmath0 number of inputs and their associated weights @xmath10 and a threshold @xmath5 . to identify different threshold cells",
    ", tlgs will follow the naming scheme tlg - n , where n is the number of inputs . in the proposed tlg , shown in figure [ fig : pnand7 ] , two input networks act as the logical inputs and a threshold value @xmath5 .",
    "assignment of signals to the input network determine the functionality of the cell .",
    "for example , the equation @xmath11 is represented as @xmath12 $ ] . to avoid any case where the input side is equal to the threshold side we double the input variables and increase the threshold by 50% .",
    "therefore , the equation becomes @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "this produces a signal assignment of left input network = @xmath14 and right input network = @xmath15 .",
    "note that the signals are inverted due to the inputs being pmos in figure [ fig : pnand7 ] .",
    "this signal assignment is unoptimized as it requires 8 transistors on one side and 3 transistors on the other side .",
    "some of the signals are moved from one side to the other for an optimal signal assignment of @xmath11 to be left input network= @xmath16 right input network = @xmath17 .",
    "note that all of these inputs will be connected to low @xmath1 transistors , as they are unobfuscated inputs .",
    "random signals will be connected to high @xmath1 inputs to hide the functionality of the cell . in the above example a tlg-5 with 1 or 2 extra obfuscated inputs can be used .",
    "the tlg shown in figure [ fig : pnand7 ] consists of three parts : an input network , a sense amplifier and a latch .",
    "the circuit works in the following manor :    1 .",
    "the logical inputs and the threshold are applied to the left and right input networks .",
    "the clock rises from a 0 to a 1 , causing nodes n5 and n6 to rise from a 0 to a 1 .",
    "the rate at which they rise is dependent upon the number of transistors on and the associated transconductance ( gm ) of each transistor .",
    "3 .   the race condition between n5 and n6 will set the sense amplifier to either a 1 or 0 . 4 .",
    "the sense amplifier will set the latch and the latched value will appear as output @xmath18 .",
    "the clock will fall from 1 to 0 causing n5 and n6 to be reset to 0 , while maintaining the output @xmath18 in the latch .",
    "therefore , the circuit acts as an edge triggered flip flop .",
    "large boolean functions can be _ absorbed _ by the cell , as the functionality of the cell is determined by the input signal assignment . provided that the absorbed logic has a delay of one clock cycle .",
    "therefore , it requires lower energy , area and delay compared to a cmos implementation of the same boolean function @xcite .",
    "the tlg topology shown in figure [ fig : pnand7 ] can be easily obfuscated . as the functionality of the tlg",
    "is determined by the input selection , it is a natural candidate for an obfuscated cell library .",
    "to obfuscate the functionality of the tlg gate this paper recommends increasing the @xmath1 on some input transistors and lowering the @xmath1 on other input transistors . by doing so , the low @xmath1 transistors will have a large transconductance , therefore , a large weight in equation [ eq_threshold_fn_def ] ; high @xmath1 transistors will have a low transconductance , therefore a small weight in equation [ eq_threshold_fn_def ] .",
    "if the difference in @xmath1 is large enough , than the difference in weights will be large enough to effectively remove the small weights for high @xmath1 transistors .",
    "so by setting two of the inputs on each side to high @xmath1 and setting the rest of the inputs to low @xmath1 , the high @xmath1 inputs will be logically removed from the calculation of equation [ eq_threshold_fn_def ] . also , the weight on the other inputs will only be determined by the number of transistors that are connected to the input signal .",
    "therefore , if someone were to reverse engineer the circuit they would not observe that some of the inputs are logically separated from the calculation of the function without measuring the @xmath1 of every input transistor . since it is very difficult to observe @xmath1 in a large layout , this approach is difficult to defeat .",
    "the novelty of this approach is that it means an attacker would not even know that the circuit was obfuscated .",
    "this defense can also hide the functionality of the circuit from the foundry . as the @xmath1 mask is used to determine obfuscated and nonobfuscated inputs . without it , it is impossible to know the operation of the circuit . because of this , one could split the fabrication up into two different foundries .",
    "one foundry would only apply the @xmath1 mask and the other foundry would fabricate the rest of the chip .",
    "another advantage of the tlg architecture is since it is comparator based , the dynamic power consumed each clock cycle is approximately the same regardless of what function is being calculated .",
    "therefore , the circuit would be immune to power attacks .",
    ".summary of obfuscated cell library [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     [ tab : filter ]",
    "this paper presents a new way to obfuscate the functionality of digital circuits and protect against counterfeiting .",
    "the approach is to use different threshold voltages on input transistors in order to logically remove certain inputs from the functionality of the circuit .",
    "this is possible in the tlg circuit , where the weight of an input is defined by the threshold voltage . by increasing the threshold voltage of an input transistor ,",
    "the associated weight of a certain input can be set to 0 .",
    "as it is very difficult to reverse engineer the threshold voltage of a transistor , an attacker can not discover the functionality of the tlg circuit .",
    "we have demonstrated this approach in 65 nm extracted layout simulations for an and gate and an xor gate at the cell level .",
    "the two gates showed that by obfuscating the circuit the delay is increased by approximately 5% .",
    "threshold logic also has the advantage of absorbing cmos logic so that the overall circuit design will be smaller .",
    "an obfuscated cell library of 7 cells was designed and laid out for high level synthesis .",
    "the library was used to obfuscate a wallace tree multiplier and a fir filter .",
    "both circuits were compared to their nonobfuscated cmos counterparts .",
    "they showed approximately a 26% decrease in area , 30% decrease in dynamic power and 45% decrease in leakage power than their static cmos counterparts .",
