    "the answer is no , because if @xmath113 exists , then the @xmath19 value of line @xmath90 , given by ( 21b ) at that @xmath113 must be equal to that of line @xmath91 , given by ( 24 ) at @xmath113 . because of the monotonic property of @xmath37 with respect to @xmath14 , this is impossible .",

    "but such intersections take place at",
    "_ different @xmath38 _ values on @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "thus they disappear in the isotherm curves in a three dimensional @xmath119 diagram .",
    "in figure  [ fig : epsart5 ] and figure  [ fig : epsart6 ] for an @xmath23 duplex there are two different liquid phases .",
    "liquid 1 has long range order in the @xmath3 sublattices and no long range order in @xmath2 sublattices .",
    "liquid 2 , on the other hand , has long range order in both sublattices . for the @xmath22 duplex",
    "there are boundary - less long rang order changes between points @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( figure  [ fig : epsart3 ] and figure  [ fig : epsart4 ] ) , in @xmath68 there is long range order in @xmath35 but not in @xmath120 , while in @xmath69 there is long range order in both sublattices .",
    "thus the duplex structure allows for a special kind of partial order in which different sublattices exhibit different long range orders .",
    "there has been many publications concerning phase transitions in lattice gas models , e.g. see @xcite .",
    "the models in the present paper seem to be the few that deal with _ exactly calculated _ phase boundaries .",
    "\\(i ) there are two key ideas in the present paper : model @xmath3 and duplex models . are these ideas too far - fetched and not realizable ?",
    "we think not : model @xmath3 is in fact a special potts model with @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "our model @xmath3 is similar to a spin-1 system@xcite , the equivalence of model @xmath3 and model @xmath2 was first pointed by griffiths@xcite . as to the duplex lattice illustrated in figure  [ fig : epsart1 ]",
    ", one could construct a stratum consisting of two sublattices , red and blue , and so that atoms on different sublattices do not interact .",
    "\\(ii ) model @xmath2 is based on onsager s solution of the ising model .",
    "long range correlation in the ising model has been extensively studied in the 1960s@xcite , and provides the basis for our understanding of gas - liquid phase transitions .",
    "to understand mathematically liquid - solid phase transitions , however , it is obvious that we need new models which allow for solid - like long range correlations , going beyond all the models discussed in the present paper",
    ". how can we construct such new models ?",
    "we speculate that adding weak attractive next - to - nearest - neighbour interactions to model @xmath2 , so as to favor the formation of small four atom squares , seems a good idea",
    ". it may be worthwhile to pursue computer studies of such models .",
