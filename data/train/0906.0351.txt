    "in this result , we develop the dipsersive estimates used to prove stability of solitons for a focussing , saturated nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) in @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 for all @xmath6 , @xmath7 has a specific structure outlined in the following definitions :    [ def : non1 ] saturated nonlinearities of type @xmath8 are of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "[ def : non2 ] saturated nonlinearities of type @xmath15 are of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 .    in both cases , for @xmath19 large ,",
    "the behavior is @xmath20 subcritical and for @xmath19 small , the behavior is @xmath20 supercritical . for definition [ def : non1 ] , @xmath21 is chosen much larger than the @xmath20 critical exponent , @xmath22 in order to allow sufficient regularity when linearizing the equation about the soliton .    in the sequel",
    ", we assume that @xmath23 and @xmath24 , or in other words , @xmath25 has finite variance . for initial data with this regularity , from the spatial and phase invariance of nls , we have many the following conserved quantities :    conservation of mass ( or charge ) : @xmath26    and    conservation of energy : @xmath27 where @xmath28    we also have the pseudoconformal conservation law : @xmath29 where @xmath30 note that @xmath31 is the hamilton flow of the linear schrdinger equation , so the above identity shows how the solution to the nonlinear equation is effected by the linear flow .    detailed proofs of these conservation laws can be arrived at easily using energy estimates or noether s theorem , which relates conservation laws to symmetries of an equation .",
    "global well - posedness in @xmath20 of ( nls ) with @xmath7 of type @xmath8 or @xmath15 for finite variance initial data follows from standard theory for @xmath20 subcritical monomial nonlinearities .",
    "proofs of the above results can be found in numerous excellent references for ( nls ) , including @xcite and @xcite .    acknowledgments .",
    "this paper is a result of a thesis done under the direction of daniel tataru at the university of california , berkeley .",
    "it is more than fair to say this work would not exist without his assistance . also , the author must specifically thank maciej zworski for pointing him towards the results of hrmander on perturbations of elliptic operators , as well as many other helpful conversations about this result .",

    "currently , the author is supported by an nsf postdoctoral fellowship .",
    "a soliton solution is of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a positive , radially symmetric , exponentially decaying solution of the equation : @xmath35 with nonlinearities of type @xmath8 or @xmath15 , soliton solutions exist and are known to be unique .",
    "existence of solitary waves for nonlinearities of the type presented in definitions [ def : non1 ] and [ def : non2 ] is proved by in @xcite by minimizing the functional @xmath36 with respect to the functional @xmath37 dx.\\ ] ] then , using a minimizing sequence and schwarz symmetrization , one sees the existence of the nonnegative , spherically symmetric , decreasing soliton solution . for uniqueness , see @xcite , where a shooting method is implemented to show that the desired soliton behavior only occurs for one particular initial value .",
    "an important fact is that @xmath38 and @xmath39 are differentiable with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "this fact can be determined from the early works of shatah , namely @xcite , @xcite . by differentiating equation , @xmath41 and @xmath42 with respect to @xmath40",
    ", we have @xmath43    numerics show that if we plot @xmath44 with respect to @xmath40 , we get a curve that goes to @xmath45 as @xmath46 and has a global minimum at some @xmath47 , see figure [ f : solcurves ] .",
    "we will explore this in detail in a subsequent numerical work @xcite .",
    "variational techniques developed in @xcite and @xcite tell us that when @xmath48 is convex , or @xmath49 , we are guaranteed stability under small perturbations , while for @xmath50 we are guaranteed that the soliton is unstable under small perturbations .",
    "we will explore the nature of this stability in another subsequent work , @xcite , where we study the full nonlinear problem . for a brief reference on this subject , see @xcite , chapter 4 .",
    "for nonlinear instability at a minimum , see @xcite . for notational purposes ,",
    "we refer to a minimal mass soliton as @xmath51 .",
    "let us write down the form of ( nls ) linearized about a soliton solution .",
    "first of all , we assume we have a solution @xmath52 . for simplicity , set @xmath53 . inserting this into the equation we know that since @xmath54 is a soliton solution we have @xmath55 by splitting @xmath56 up into its real and imaginary parts then doing a taylor expansion . hence ,",
    "if @xmath57 , we get @xmath58 where @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61    [ spec : defn1 ] a hamiltonian , @xmath62 , is called admissible if the following conditions hold : + 1 ) there are no embedded eigenvalues in the essential spectrum , + 2 ) the only real eigenvalue in @xmath63 $ ] is @xmath64 , + 3 ) the values @xmath65 are not resonances . +    [ spec : defn2 ] let ( nls ) be taken with nonlinearity @xmath7 .",
    "we call @xmath7 admissible if there exists a minimal mass soliton , @xmath51 , for ( nls ) and the hamiltonian , @xmath62 , resulting from linearization about @xmath51 is admissible in terms of definition [ spec : defn1 ] .",
    "the spectral properties we need for the linearized hamiltonian equation in order to prove stability results are precisely those from definition [ spec : defn1 ] .",
    "notationally , we refer to @xmath66 and @xmath67 as the projections onto the discrete spectrum of @xmath62 and onto the continuous spectrum of @xmath62 respectively .",
    "analysis of these spectral conditions will be done both numerically and analytically in @xcite .",
    "we derive the existence and important properties of distorted fourier bases @xmath68 of non - self - adjoint matrix hamiltonians , and hence a distorted fourier transform , for a general class of matrix hamiltonians .",
    "let @xmath69 be the schwartz class of functions .",
    "then , we have the following results :    [ thm : tdec ] given an admissible hamiltonian @xmath62 , and the projection on the continuous spectrum of @xmath62 , @xmath67 , for initial data @xmath70 , we have @xmath71    let us define the space @xmath72 with norm @xmath73 defined in the standard fashion .",
    "[ thm : wlindec ] let @xmath62 be an admissible hamiltonian as defined above",
    ". assume @xmath74 and @xmath75 for multi - indices @xmath76 , @xmath7 such that @xmath77 , where @xmath78 then , @xmath79 for any @xmath80 .",
    "it should be noted that similar estimates were proven in the works @xcite and @xcite , where in the first the techniques used were more along the lines of resolvent estimates and in the second the fact that the nonlinearities of interest were of even integer powers was crucial to the argument .",
    "here , we take an approach similar to that of scattering theory as presented in @xcite .",
    "scattering theory is related to a resolvent approach most certainly , though there are certain benefits to the method we thought would be of general interest .",
    "note , these dispersive estimates are essential for the forthcoming argument in @xcite , where perturbations of minimal mass solitons are analyzed .",
    "we present here a review of combined results from @xcite and @xcite , chapter 14 .",
    "both presentations are valid for operators of the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a self - adjoint , constant coefficient differential operator and @xmath83 is a short range , symmetric differential operator .",
    "the perturbation @xmath83 is defined to be short range in order to say that @xmath84 exists in the uniform operator topology of @xmath85 , where @xmath86 and @xmath87    also , for any @xmath88 , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the resolvent for the constant coefficient operator , @xmath91 . as the notion of short range deals with compactness of the operator @xmath92 , being short range requires sufficient decay assumptions at @xmath45 on @xmath93 .",
    "heuristically , it is required that the coefficients of @xmath93 decrease as fast as an integrable function in @xmath94 and for each fixed @xmath95 , we have @xmath96    the reasons why these heuristics hold true are explored below , hence we forgo this analysis here and move on with the fact that @xmath83 is a short range perturbation as an assumption .",
    "note that in the case explored below , @xmath93 is schwartz in @xmath97 and is dominated by @xmath98 as @xmath99 .",
    "it is also important to note that while contour integration works out nicely in @xmath100 , the results presented here hold in any dimension where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are arrived at through a limiting procedure .",
    "the agmon approach to the distorted fourier transform is equivalent to the approach taken by the author .",
    "namely , we define @xmath103 ( x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , the distorted fourier transform is a map @xmath104 such that + ( i ) @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the restriction of @xmath20 to the discrete spectrum of @xmath91 .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath107 , the restriction of @xmath20 to the continuous spectrum of @xmath91 .",
    "then , the restriction of @xmath108 is a unitary operator from @xmath109 onto @xmath20 , + ( ii ) for any @xmath110 @xmath111 and @xmath112 where @xmath113 is an increasing sequence of compact sets such that @xmath114 for @xmath115 and + ( iii ) if @xmath116 is the projection of @xmath20 onto @xmath109 , then @xmath117 for any @xmath118 where @xmath119 denotes multiplication by @xmath98 .",
    "in addition , we have @xmath120 . in other words",
    ", we have a plancherel theorem for our distorted fourier basis .",
    "now , @xcite , chapter 14 arrives at the same conclusions using @xmath121 however , using the resolvent identity @xmath122 we will see that a formal iteration shows equivalence between these definitions for @xmath123 large .",
    "it is precisely this iteration we use below to get uniform bounds in @xmath123 .",
    "in this section , we derive the integral kernel in @xmath100 for the inverse of the differential operator @xmath124 where we have set @xmath125 for simplicity",
    ". this will be quite useful in deriving the distorted fourier basis functions for more complicated operators belows .",
    "specifically , given @xmath126 , we find @xmath127 such that if @xmath128 then @xmath129    to begin , we fourier transform the equation to see @xmath130 hence @xmath131*f.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so , @xmath132(x - y),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we can define @xmath133(x)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a meaningful sense .    without loss of generality , set @xmath134 .",
    "initially , asssume that @xmath135 , though this will be easily seen as a limiting case in the end .",
    "we have @xmath136 by first making a rotational change of variables where @xmath137 , then using polar coordinates .",
    "now , we are set up to use contour integration to find @xmath138 .",
    "see figure [ fig : fund1 ] for the contour over which we integrate .",
    "we call this contour @xmath139",
    ".    then , we have from residue theory @xmath140 \\\\ & = & \\pi i e^{i|x|\\mu}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    however , breaking @xmath141 down , we also have @xmath142    combining terms and taking @xmath143 , we have @xmath144 this is valid for all @xmath97 since the integral diverges as @xmath145 .    using simple residue theory , taking the distributional conventions @xmath146 or @xmath147 result in @xmath148 to see this , define @xmath149 ( x ) \\\\",
    "& = & \\mathcal{f}^{-1 } [ ( ( |\\xi| - \\mu - i\\epsilon ) ( |\\xi| + \\mu + i \\epsilon ) ) ^{-1 } ] ( x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , we may make the same change of variables and do contour integration as above , though in this case we need not worry about avoiding @xmath150 .",
    "so , our contour @xmath151 is the hemisphere on the upper half plane formed by the real axis and the half circle of radius say @xmath152 .",
    "the only residue in such a region would be given by @xmath153 as @xmath154 is outside @xmath151 . for each @xmath155 , we then have @xmath156 taking @xmath157 gives formula for @xmath158 .",
    "the analysis for @xmath159 is similar .",
    "the above analysis is then easily seen to be equivalent to applying to the distributional connvention @xmath160,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] namely the case where both residues lying on the real axis must be taken into account . however , since our eventual goal is to work with oscillatory integrals , for convenience and without loss of generality , we will work with the complex operator @xmath161 .",
    "note that in the sequel , we take the convention that the soliton parameter is @xmath162 instead of @xmath40 .",
    "this serves to remind the reader of the positivity of this parameter .",
    "the convention of @xmath40 slightly simplifies the variational formulation , but has no impact on the linear analysis presented here .      from , @xmath166 u_{\\xi_0 } & = & ( -\\delta + \\lambda^2 ) v_2 u_{\\xi_0 } + v_1 ( -\\delta + \\lambda^2 - v_2 ) u_{\\xi_0}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "hence , @xmath167 g_{\\xi_0 } & = & f_{\\xi_0 } ( x ) e^{i x \\xi_0 } + \\tilde{v } ( x , d ) g_{\\xi_0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath168 and @xmath169 is a schwartz function .",
    "then , taking the fourier transform , we have @xmath170 \\hat{g}_{\\xi_0 } =   \\hat{f}(\\xi;\\xi_0 ) + ( \\tilde{v}_{\\mathcal{f } } \\hat{g}_{\\xi_0 } ) ( \\xi),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath171    given @xmath172 \\\\ & = & [ ( |\\xi|+|\\xi_0|)(|\\xi| - |\\xi_0|)(|\\xi|^2 + 2 \\lambda^2 + |\\xi_0|^2)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have @xmath173 where @xmath174 and @xmath175.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that for simplicity we have omitted a small complex perturbation in the elliptic term @xmath176 since it does not effect the analysis .    to explore @xmath177 further ,",
    "we see in @xmath178 @xmath179 using the change of variables @xmath180 .",
    "then , we have @xmath181 doing integration first in @xmath182 , then a contour integral , we have as in section [ s : ck ] that @xmath183.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for simplicity , we take @xmath184 as the analysis for @xmath185 will be similar .",
    "then , we want to use an iterative argument to show that for mid to high range frequencies , these distorted fourier bases exist in @xmath186 . it will become clear in the sequel why @xmath186 is chosen .",
    "note that since near @xmath64 , @xmath187 is bounded , we have @xmath188 for any @xmath189 .",
    "in particular we show the following :            using distribution theory , we have for @xmath193 @xmath194 , \\\\ \\tilde{k}^{2}_{\\xi_0 } ( x ) & = & \\frac{i 2 \\pi^2 e^{i |x| |\\xi_0| } } { |\\xi_0|}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as convolution operators , @xmath195 and @xmath196 hence we wish to wish to define @xmath197 in such a way as to preserve these estimates and such that @xmath198 is analytic for @xmath199 and continuous for @xmath200 .",
    "however , after making a branch cut on the left half of the real axis , for @xmath193 we have @xmath201 and continuity on @xmath200 follows easily on a strip in the complex plane . for analyticity inside the strip ,",
    "it is clear any factors gained taking derivatives will be logarithmic and hence controlled by the polynomially decaying coefficients from @xmath202 .",
    "hence , using complex interpolation @xmath203      [ thm : dfbu ] let @xmath207 be a differential operator of the form @xmath208 where @xmath209 , @xmath210 .",
