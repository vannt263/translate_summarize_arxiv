    "the eb parameter depends on measurement time and lag time , and can be used to compare experimental data with predictions of fractional equations ( the eb parameter for the ctrw is given in @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted however that for sub - diffusion in the cell , effects of the boundary of the cell , may be important , and these effects where not considered in this text .",
    "another important difference is that _ for an infinite system _ we have for the ctrw @xmath153 , so the time average procedure yields a linear dependence on @xmath45 and an aging effect with respect to the measurement time . hence for ctrw an anomalous diffusion process may seem normal with respect to @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "in contrast for the fractional models we investigated here , we have @xmath154 which is the same as the ensemble average @xmath114 . the main difference between the two approaches ,",
    "is that the ctrw process is non - stationary",
