    "the internal / external shock scenario ( see e.g. piran 2004 ; meszaros 2006 ) is currently the leading model to explain the complex phenomenology of gamma  ray bursts ( grbs ) prompt and afterglow emission . despite",
    "it can account for many observed characteristics , there are a few open issues and difficulties that this model can not solve , or can accommodate only with some important modifications .    here",
    "we recall some problems of the standard scenario and mention some ideas already put forward to account for them .",
    "* _ efficiency i : high @xmath3contrast  _ in internal shocks only the relative kinetic energy of the two colliding shells can be dissipated . thus ",
    "dynamical \" efficiencies of only a few per cent can be achieved for colliding shells whose lorentz factors @xmath3 differ by a factor of order unity . such efficiency has to include energy dissipated into randomizing protons , amplifying ( or even generating ) magnetic fields and accelerating emitting leptons .",
    "as the emitted radiation is produced only by the latter component , it corresponds to just a fraction of the dynamical efficiency .",
    "this problem , pointed out , among others , by kumar ( 1999 ) can be solved by postulating contrasts in @xmath3 much exceeding 100 ( belobodorov 2000 ; kobayashi & sari 2001 ) . in these cases",
    "the typical lorentz factor of grbs should thus largely exceed the  canonical \" value @xmath4 100 . in this case",
    "it is difficult to understand how the value of the peak energy of the prompt spectrum does not wildly change . *",
    "_ efficiency ii : afterglow / prompt power ratio  _ a related inconsistency concerns the observed ratios of the bolometric fluence originated in the afterglow to that in the prompt phase . since external shocks are dynamically more efficient than internal ones , such ratio is expected to exceed one , contrary to current estimates .",
    "the problem has been exacerbated by the recent observations by the swift satellite , showing that the x  ray afterglow light curve seen after a few hours  thought to be smoothly connected with the end of the prompt  comprises a steep early phase . as a consequence ,",
    "the total afterglow energy is less than what postulated before .",
    "willingale et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , parameterizing the behavior of the swift grb x  ray light curves , derived an average x  ray afterglow  to  prompt fluence ratio around 10 per cent ( see also zhang et al . 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , the very same origin of the early x  ray radiation as produced by external shocks is questioned , since its behavior is different from the optical one ( e.g. panaitescu et al .",
    "if the x  ray emission does not originate in the afterglow phase , this further reduces the above ratio . * _ the spectral energy correlations  _ correlations have been found between i ) the energy where most of the prompt power is emitted @xmath5 and the isotropic prompt bolometric energetics @xmath6 ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ; amati 2006 ) , and ii ) @xmath7 and the collimation corrected energetics @xmath8 .",
    "the slope of the former correlation is @xmath9 while the slope of the latter depends on the radial profile of the circumburst density . for a homogeneous density medium @xmath10 ( ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004 ) , while for a wind  like profile in density ( @xmath11 ) the correlation is linear : @xmath12 ( nava et al .",
    "2006 ; ghirlanda et al .",
    "if linear , the relation is lorentz invariant and indicates that different gbrs roughly emit the same number of photons at the peak ( i.e. @xmath13 constant ) .",
    "+ note that the derivation of @xmath14 requires not only information on the jet break time @xmath15 , but also a model relating @xmath16 with the collimation angle @xmath17 , which in turn depends on the circumburst density value , profile and the radiative efficiency @xmath18 ( i.e. @xmath19 ) .",
    "the phenomenological connection among the three observables @xmath6 , @xmath20 and @xmath15 , as found by liang & zhang ( 2005 ) , is instead model  independent .",
    "it is of the form @xmath21 , which for @xmath22 is consistent with the ghirlanda relation ( both in the homogeneous and wind case ; see nava et al .",
    "a further tight phenomenological relation appears to link three prompt emission quantities : the isotropic peak luminosity @xmath23 , @xmath7 and the time interval @xmath24 during which the emission is above a certain level ( firmani et al .",
    "all these correlations were not predicted by the internal / external shock scenario , and can only be reconciled with it as long as specific dependences of the bulk lorentz factor upon @xmath25 are satisfied ( see table 1 in zhang & meszaros 2002 ) .",
    "the above issues motivate the search for alternatives or for substantial modifications of the standard model .",
    "the efficiency problem and the existence of the spectral  energy relations prompted thompson ( 2006 , t06 hereafter ) and thompson meszaros & rees ( 2007 , t07 hereafter ) to suggest that , besides internal shocks , dissipation might also occur because of the interaction between the fireball and the walls of the funnel in the star through which it propagates ( see  2 ) .",
    "this hypothesis also introduces a typical scale to the problem , namely the radius of the progenitor star ( @xmath26@xmath27 cm ) : shear instabilities within @xmath28 can reconvert a significant fraction of bulk kinetic energy into heat .",
    "since this dissipation occurs up to @xmath28 ( i.e. not far from the transparency radius ) , the increased internal energy can only partially reconvert into bulk motion via adiabatic expansion , increasing the efficiency .",
    "similarly , studies of magnetized fireballs ( e.g. drenkhahn & spruit , 2002 ; giannios & spruit 2007 ) have shown that dissipation of magnetic energy through reconnection can also contribute to increase the radiation content of the fireball at relatively large radii .    along the above mentioned lines , in this letter",
    "we propose a further possible way in which a large fraction of the fireball bulk energy can be dissipated at distances @xmath29 .",
    "this assumes that at these distances the fireball collides with some mass which is ( nearly ) at rest : a small fraction of the mass swept up in the funnel left along the fireball propagation axis is sufficient to lead to efficient dissipation .",
    "hereafter such mass will be referred to as  idm \" ( intervening debris of the cocoon material ) .",
    "the treatment of the collision is simplified , in order to allow an analytical and simple description .",
    "we assume the idm to be at rest and homogeneous in density and the fireball to have a lorentz factor @xmath30 .",
    "the interaction is described in  steps \" , while in reality will be continuous in time .",
    "a complete treatment of the dynamics and emission properties of our model requires numerical simulations ( of the kind presented in morsony et al .",
    "2007 , introducing some erratic behavior of the injected jet energy ) .",
    "interestingly , the model predicts that jet properties depend on the polar angle ( like in a structured jet , see rossi et al .",
    "2002 ) and it naturally implies a connection among the observed spectral  energy correlations .",
    "as mentioned , t06 and t07 proposed a model in which the efficiency of the dissipation of kinetic energy into radiation is enhanced with respect to the internal shock scenario and the spectral energy correlations , in particular the amati one , can be accounted for . at the same time , in their scenario synchrotron emission could play a minor role , the radiation field being dominated by thermalized high energy photons or by the inverse compton process .    for what follows it is useful to summarize their main arguments here . consider a fireball that at some distance @xmath31@xmath28 from the central engine is moving relativistically with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath32",
    ". the fireball is initially propagating inside the funnel of the progenitor star .",
    "t06 and t07 assume that a large fraction of the energy dissipated at @xmath31 is thermalized into  radiation of luminosity @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the temperatures at @xmath31 in the comoving and observing frame , respectively .",
    "the collimation corrected luminosity is @xmath36 which , for small semi  aperture angles @xmath37 of the jetted fireball ( assumed conical ) , gives @xmath38 a key assumption of the model is that @xmath39 .",
    "the argument behind it is that if @xmath40 , shear  driven instabilities have not time to grow ( in the comoving frame ) , while in the opposite case the flow mixes easily with the heavier material and decelerates to @xmath41 .",
    "then , assuming @xmath42 and substituting it in eq .",
    "[ bb1 ] @xmath43 [ bb2 ] setting @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the duration of the prompt emission , gives @xmath47 this corresponds to the amati relation if @xmath48 is similar in different bursts and the dispersion of grb durations is also limited .",
    "it should be noted that a relation similar to the amati one can be also recovered adopting @xmath49 , as suggested by the ghirlanda relation .",
    "for instance , for @xmath50 ( wind case ) @xmath51 for the derivation of eq . 4 ( and 5 ) a key assumption is the dependence on temperature of the black  body law , which leads to both a slope _ and _ a normalization similar to those characterizing the amati relation .",
    "we can ask what happens if , instead of a black  body , one assumes that the spectrum is a cutoff power  law .",
    "this question is particularly relevant since the burst spectrum is rarely described by a pure black  body ( even if some bursts is , see ghirlanda et al .",
    "2003 ) , and also the black  body plus power  law model ( ryde 2005 ) faces severe problems , even considering time resolved spectra ( ghirlanda et al . 2007b ) .    how is the above derivation modified if , instead of a black  body emission , the spectrum is best described by a cutoff power ",
    "consider then a spectrum described in the comoving frame by @xmath52 and approximate the observed isotropic bolometric luminosity as @xmath53 this leads to @xmath54 therefore the dependence of the amati relation can be recovered even for cutoff power  law spectra , but the normalization in this case is not determined . note also that for @xmath55 ( wien spectrum ) , eq .",
    "[ cpl ] and eq .",
    "[ bb3 ] have the same dependences .",
    "to excavate a funnel inside a progenitor star of mass @xmath56 solar masses , the  proto  jet \" has to push out the mass that did not fall into the newly born black hole .",
    "this means a fraction of @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the funnel opening angle .",
    "this mass expands sideways as the proto ",
    "jet breaks out at the surface of the progenitor , forming a cocoon ( see also ramirez - ruiz , celotti & rees 2002 ) .",
    "we must expect , however , that after the break  out the region in front of the funnel will not be perfectly cleared of mass . to be irrelevant , the mass @xmath59 left as idm should be @xmath60 : less than one in a million particles should remain there .",
    "if the jetted fireball is not continuous , this mass may be still there at the moment of the arrival of the new fireball pulse . and even if @xmath59 is @xmath61@xmath62 the excavated mass , the idm can have important dynamical effects on it .",
    "as the bulk velocity and energy content of the idm can be neglected in comparison to those of the coming fireball , it will be approximated as initially at rest and cold .",
    "an interesting aspect of this scenario concerns multi  peaked bursts , especially when pulses in the prompt emission are separated by quiescent periods .",
    "if the central engine works at a reduced rate during quiescence , material from the walls of the funnel , previously in pressure equilibrium with the jet , will tend to refill again the funnel ( see also wang & meszaros 2007 ) .",
    "this requires a time @xmath63 s , where @xmath64 is the sound speed , and @xmath65 cm is the radius at the base of the funnel .",
    "then the amount of mass which should be pushed out again depends upon the quiescent time , but that after @xmath41 second , the funnel is completely closed , and the process repeats itself .      in the following we derive the main characteristics of the system formed by a fireball impacting against the idm .",
    "consider a fireball with energy @xmath66 , mass @xmath67 and bulk lorentz factor @xmath68 , impacting against a mass @xmath59 , initially at rest .",
    "-0.7 true cm    -1 true cm    the energy and momentum conservation laws read @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the dynamical efficiency measured in the frame moving at @xmath71 . solving for @xmath72 and @xmath70 gives @xmath73 the lorentz factor @xmath74 is shown in fig .",
    "[ tappo1 ] as a function of @xmath59 for four values of @xmath66 ( top panel ) and as a function of @xmath66 for three values of @xmath59 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "one can see that for the process to be interesting ( i.e. @xmath74 significantly smaller than @xmath32 ) and to avoid  over  loading \" of baryons ( too small @xmath74 ) @xmath59 is required to be in specific ranges , that depend on @xmath66 .",
    "these ranges , however , encompass almost two orders of magnitude .",
    "@xmath74 as a function of @xmath75 is reported in fig .",
    "[ tappoeff ] .",
    "the power ",
    "law dependence @xmath76 can be derived directly from eq .",
    "[ betac ] , since @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath74 is limited to @xmath80 even for @xmath81 , corresponding to @xmath82 .    in fig .",
    "[ tappoeff ] we show @xmath83 and @xmath84 as a function of @xmath75 . for clarity also",
    "the fraction of the initial kinetic energy preserved after the collision @xmath85 is plotted .",
    "the sum @xmath86 is unity by definition .",
    "note that since @xmath75 is a ratio , @xmath59 and @xmath66 can be taken both as  isotropic \" or ",
    "real \" ( collimation corrected ) values .",
    "-0.5 true cm    -0.7 true cm      after the collision / dissipation phase the fireball+idm is expected to be optically thick : the thompson scattering optical depth of the idm material is @xmath87 while the optical depth of the fireball just before the collision is of order @xmath88 where @xmath59 and @xmath66 are here isotropic quantities .",
    "these large optical depths imply that the radiation produced following the collision is trapped inside the fireball+idm system , which will expand because of the internal pressure . in the frame moving with @xmath74 , the expansion is isotropic . in this frame some final @xmath89 will be reached . as seen in the observer frame ,",
    "the expansion is highly asymmetric , and the geometry of the system resembles a cone , with semi  aperture angle given by ( barbiellini , celotti & longo 2003 ) @xmath90 where the last equality assumed @xmath91 ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) .",
    "therefore the aperture angle of the re - born fireball is related to @xmath74 , independently of the initial @xmath3factor of the fireball _ before _ the collision or _",
    "after _ the expansion .",
    "note that the initial aperture angle of the fireball is irrelevant , as it is the aperture angle of the funnel of the progenitor star .",
    "-0.5 true cm    -0.7 true cm    the fireball is not collimated in a perfect cone , and mass and energy propagate also outside @xmath17 . since in the frame",
    "moving with @xmath74 it expands isotropically , @xmath94 is approximately constant .",
    "therefore in the observer frame @xmath95 also the resulting lorentz factor @xmath3 is angle dependent : from the relativistic composition of velocity ( e.g. rybicki & lightman 1979 ) : @xmath96^{-1/2}\\ , = \\ , \\gamma^\\prime \\gamma_{\\rm c } ( 1+\\beta^\\prime\\beta_{\\rm c}\\cos\\theta^\\prime ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the observed @xmath3factor is constant up to angles slightly smaller than @xmath97 , and decreases as @xmath98 above .    as a consequence of the angular dependence of mass and bulk lorentz factor ,",
    "also the energy depends on @xmath99 as @xmath100 such dependences of mass , @xmath3 and @xmath101 on polar angle are illustrated in fig .",
    "the jet is structured and well approximated by a top  hat jet : the energy profile is nearly constant within an angle slightly smaller than @xmath97 , and at larger angles decreases approximately as a steep power ",
    "law @xmath102 , since @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "this particular behavior gives raise to an afterglow light curve indistinguishable from a top  hat jet ( see rossi et al .",
    "the most appealing feature of the proposed model is the high efficiency in re  converting the fireball kinetic energy into internal pressure at a radius comparable to the radius of the progenitor star , i.e. on a scale not far from the transparency one .",
    "also the observed energetics of the internal radiation will be large , since the system becomes transparent during ( or slightly after ) the expansion / acceleration phase , similarly to the standard fireball models of initially high entropy , where the fireball becomes transparent before coasting .",
    "our model therefore increases the parameter space of high efficiency regimes .",
    "our model is also similar to the model proposed by t06 and t07 and to those in which the dissipation of an energetically important magnetic field occurs at large radii ( see e.g. giannios & spruit 2007 ) .",
    "the efficiency of the energy re ",
    "conversion for the fireball ",
    "idm collision is of the order of 5080 per cent for large ranges in the mass of the idm and energy of the fireball ( see fig .",
    "[ tappoeff ] ) .    with respect to the idea proposed by t07 , summarised in",
    " 2 , in our scenario there is no requirement on any specific value for the fireball bulk lorentz factor @xmath32 prior to its collision with the idm . note also that in the t07 model , a  standard \" fireball ( i.e. not magnetic ) moving with @xmath106 can dissipate part of its kinetic energy , but it can not reach final @xmath3factors larger than @xmath32 , which is bound to be small for typical @xmath37 . in our case the final @xmath3 can instead be large , ( even if always smaller than @xmath32 ) .",
    "the jet angle is @xmath107 even for large values of the initial @xmath32 and final @xmath3 .",
    "this is a result of our model , and not an assumption .",
    "the re  born fireball is structured and the @xmath108 and @xmath109 behaviors imply that @xmath110 depends on @xmath99 as steep power  laws . despite the angle dependence of the energy ,",
    "the jet should produce an afterglow indistinguishable from a top  hat jet . clearly our description of the fireball ",
    "idm interaction is extremely simplified , aimed at building a physical intuition based on the analytical treatment .",
    "more realistic situations should be studied via numerical simulations , but we would like to comment on two aspects .",
    "i ) even if the idm is initially at rest , as soon as the fireball starts depositing a fraction of energy and momentum , the idm would begin to move .",
    "the whole process will take long enough that towards the end it would be probably better described as the interaction with a moving idm , with a consequent loss of efficiency .",
    "ii ) in a ` continuos ' ( non  intermittent ) scenario , the idm would predominantly interact with the fireball edge , causing only a partial dissipation of its energy and the formation of a  fast spine  slow layer \" structure . in this case",
    "the determination of the relevant jet opening angle ( i.e. within which most of the energy is concentrated ) requires a more accurate numerical treatment .    despite of these caveats ,",
    "it is still interesting to consider whether the model can account for the spectral  energy correlations , or at least highlight the relations between them . consider the ghirlanda correlation in the wind case , @xmath111 , that can be rewritten as @xmath112 for small @xmath37 .",
    "the requirement that also @xmath113 ( amati relation ) leads to : @xmath114 i.e. more energetic bursts are more collimated , as predicted in our model . the above condition ( eq . [ egtheta ] ) can be quantitatively satisfied if i ) the mass against which the fireball collides is similar in different grbs , namely @xmath115 ( see fig . [ tappo1 ] ) and ii ) the prompt emission luminosity @xmath14 is also a constant fraction of @xmath66 for different grbs .",
    "[ egtheta ] does not explain the amati or ghirlanda relations , although it offers some physical meanings of required connection between the two .",
    "note that , in the standard internal shock model model , one can recover the amati relation if @xmath116 constant ( see zhang & meszaros 2002 ) .    in this letter we did not discuss the characteristics of the spectrum predicted in our scenario ( nava et al .",
    ", in prep ) . in general terms , the most effective radiation process would be  dynamical compton \" , or fermi  acceleration \" of photons , as discussed by gruzinov & meszaros ( 2000 ) in the context of internal shocks .",
    "the large number of photons per proton in the fireball ( corresponding to the  fossil \" radiation that has accelerated the fireball itself in the first place ) implies that a significant fraction of the internal energy following the fireball  idm collision _ directly _ energizes photons , i.e. photons amplify their energy by interacting with leptons with bulk momentum not yet randomized in the shock .",
    "the process is analogous to particle acceleration in shocks and gives raise to high energy photons , conserving their number .",
    "since this occurs at @xmath0 cm , i.e. slightly above the progenitor star , the re  born fireball will become transparent during or just after the acceleration phase ( at a transparency radius @xmath117 cm , eq .",
    "[ tauc ] ) .",
    "this ensures that photons do not have time to loose energy via adiabatic expansion , once again leading to large efficiencies .",
    "the timescale for the refilling of the funnel during quiescent phases of the central engine can be short enough that the process repeats itself .",
    "the estimated refilling timescale is of the order of a second : bursts with shorter or longer ` quiescent ' phases should then show different properties .",
    "if the fireball  idm collision is the dominant process for the dissipation ( and emission ) , more energetic spikes are expected to follow longer quiescent phases ( see ramirez  ruiz & merloni , 2001 ) .",
