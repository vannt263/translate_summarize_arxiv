    "in 1935 , schrdinger proposed a thought - experiment of a superposition of macroscopically distinct states @xcite .",
    "study of macroscopic superpositions is crucial to our understanding the boundary between the quantum and classical world , and the quest for physical realization of macroscopic superposition states is ongoing @xcite .",
    "in fact , mesoscopic superpositions of photon field have been observed in cavity qed experiment by brune _",
    "they provide a very clear way to create and measure superposition states of photons in a cavity @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "a two - level atom is prepared as a superposition of the excited and ground states .",
    "the microwave photon field is a coherent state @xmath0 of a quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite , where the mean number of photons is @xmath1 .",
    "the two - level atom is sent through the cavity and dispersively interacts with the microwave field .",
    "in this process , the two opposite phase shifts of photon field depending on two different states of atom are acquired .",
    "consequently , a superposition of photon states is generated .    however , this photon state is a superposition of the two coherent states with only a few quanta @xcite .",
    "it is still far - reaching to realize robust mescoscopic superpositions because they are extremely fragile .",
    "thus , it is necessary to find a decoherence - free quantum system or system with a low decoherence rate to generate and observe such states .",
    "bose - einstein condensation of atomic gases @xcite is a promising candidate to exhibit this quantum phenomenon .",
    "many fascinating experiments of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( bec s ) have been done in which long coherence times have been observed @xcite .",
    "this may be used to produce a superposition of quantum states so a `` big cat '' state would be experimentally observed .",

    "recently , a bec has been loaded into a magnetic trap using optical tweezers @xcite and can also be transported via a magnetic waveguide @xcite .",
    "it paves a way to transfer a bec into a cavity . for a two - component condensate ,",
    "its ground state and low lying excitations behave in the same way of a quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "more than that , this `` mesoscopic quantum harmonic oscillator '' being made by bec , is more robust and long - lived than that of the cavity photon field .",
    "indeed , the coherence times of the atomic condensates have been measured in the ramsey spectroscopy which exceeds 1 s @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very encouraging that quantum superpositions of this mesoscopic quantum object will be observed .",
    "we consider a two - component condensate sent through a high - q microwave cavity .",
    "the atoms dispersively interact with the photon field in which no absorption or emission of photons occurs in the dynamics . in this paper , we will show that a superposition of the condensates states with two different relative phases @xcite are generated during the dispersive interaction between the atoms and the photon field",
    ". the detection of these superposition states is also discussed .",
    "we will also investigate the creation of compass states of ultracold atoms with a cavity .",
    "compass states have been proposed by zurek @xcite which are `` generalized '' schrodinger cat states with a superposition of more than two distinguishable coherent states .",

    "the states are very robust to magnetic noise since they have similar magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "the lower state @xmath3 couples to an immediate state @xmath12 via a microwave cavity field with a detuning @xmath13 , for @xmath14 and @xmath4 are the energy difference frequencies between the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the microwave frequency respectively . a classical field with radio frequency @xmath15",
    "is applied to the cavity and no photon is fed into the cavity .",
    "the upper state @xmath6 interacts with the state @xmath2 through the classical radio - frequency ( rf ) field with a detuning @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the energy splitting frequency .",
    "the two internal states @xmath6 and @xmath3 are effectively coupled @xcite via the two - photon transition @xcite as shown in fig [ engdiagm1 ] . in this way , the two - photon transition can be used as a `` quantum switch '' of the interaction of two internal states and the microwave field through controlling the rf field .    in the interaction picture ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian , describing the two - photon interaction between the microwave cavity field and the classical rf field , and the number of @xmath18 two - level atoms in the condensates , has the form ( @xmath19 ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the annihilation operator of the microwave cavity field , atomic inversion and atomic transition operators for the condensates respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the two - photon detuning and the effective two - photon rabi frequency respectively .    the bec has been confined in a very tight trap with the transverse size being less than @xmath26 @xmath27 m @xcite .",
    "the wavelength of a microwave field is much longer than the size of the condensates .",
    "therefore , we have considered that all atoms interact with the cavity field in the same form .",
    "we also assume that atom - atom interactions are very small compared to the strength of atom - light coupling so that we can neglect the nonlinear terms @xmath28 coming from the self - interactions between the atoms @xcite .      in the low - lying excitations regime , we are able to make the approximation based on the holsetin - primakoff transformation @xcite .",
    "this allows us to approximate the angular momentum operators into harmonic oscillators : @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 as long as the excitations are small , i.e. , @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this means an atomic coherent state with `` small '' excitations can be approximated to a coherent state of a harmonic oscillator which can be expressed in the form as @xcite : @xmath33 is a quantum number of excitations in the condensates .",
    "the degree of excitation of the atomic coherent state can be adjusted by a two - photon rabi pulse @xcite .",
    "the condensates can well be approximate as a coherent state for which the number of excitations @xmath1 is up to several hundred and the number of atoms @xmath34 to @xmath35 @xcite .    in the following discussion",

    ", the photon field state will become the form in eq .",
    "( [ photon - state ] ) . if we constraint the photon state in the single excitation and the vacuum state only such that we are able to represent the bosonic oscillators in terms of pauli operators @xcite : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    after the above transformations",
    ", we can readily obtain an effective hamiltonian as : @xmath41 we can see that this hamiltonian has the same form of the well - known jaynes - cumming ( jc ) model @xcite .",
    "this effective hamiltonian is valid as long as no further excitations of the photon field is made in the dynamics .",
    "thus , it is very good to describe the dispersive interaction between atoms and microwave field in which no net photon is either absorbed or created during the process .",
    "it is noteworthy that the rabi - coupling strength is vastly enhanced by a factor of @xmath42 .",
    "this effective jc rabi - coupling strength @xmath43 can be increased with 100 times for @xmath18 @xmath44 @xmath45 .",
    "we estimate this effective rabi frequency can be high as 100 khz if @xmath46 khz .",
    "the strong atom - photon coupling strength is crucial to increase the efficiency of the cat states production .",
    "this jc model can be exactly diagonalized which allows us to solve the problem analytically .",
    "if the detuning @xmath47 is large enough with @xmath48 , the eigenvectors can be expressed in this approximate form as @xcite : @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "now we propose a scheme to generate the cat state with only a few steps , where the atoms are dispersively coupled to microwave field .",
    "we consider the initial state as a product state of the photon and the atoms , i.e. , @xmath53 then , the condensate is transported through the cavity , and the interaction between the atoms and microwave field is switched on for the duration time @xmath54",
    ". the state will become @xcite @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the smooth transport of atoms through a magnetic waveguide has also been demonstrated which shows negligible atoms losses during the transfer @xcite .",
    "we can make the unitary transformation of the photon state @xmath57 with a two - level atom as follows @xcite : @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this can be achieved by interacting the photon field with a two - level atom appropriately @xcite . the state is then written as @xmath60 a schrdinger cat state of condensates is readily obtained by either measuring the photon state @xmath61 or @xmath37 .",
    "the two possible superposition states are @xmath62 . physically speaking",
    ", this cat state is a superposition of the states with two different relative phases of the two - component condensates .",
    "the lifetime @xmath63 of the cat state is roughly equal to @xmath64 as @xmath65 @xcite , where @xmath66 is the characteristic damping time of the condensates and @xmath67 is `` distance '' between two coherent states @xcite .",
    "the characteristic damping time of the bec is about the coherence lifetime of the condensates @xmath68 .",
    "obviously , the cat state lifetime is significantly shortened if the magnitude of @xmath69 is very large .",
    "but the coherence time of the atomic condensates ( @xmath68 @xmath70 1 to 2 s ) is relatively long @xcite , we are able to estimate the cat state s lifetime @xmath63 is about 1 to 10 ms if the number of excitations is up to several hundred .",
    "next we discuss how to detect such superposition states in condensates .",
    "we note that the photon and the condensates are entangled in eq .",
    "( [ cat ] ) , therefore the photon state can be used to probe the state of atomic condensates .",
    "this enables us to measure the superposition states through detecting the photon state .",
    "we consider the cat state in eq .",

    "let the system undergo a free evolution @xmath72 for a small amount of time @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",
    "we switch on the jc interaction again for a duration @xmath75 to undo the cat state . after performing @xmath57 on the photon state , up to a global phase",

    "the probability of photon state can be measured by means of a two - level atom @xcite .",
    "indeed , this method has been proposed to perform heisenberg limited precision measurement @xcite to detect the small rotation of the state in the phase space .",
    "having discussed how to generate schrdinger cat states , we proceed to study another kind of superposition states which is called the compass state @xcite .",
    "it is a generalization to the usual schrdinger cat state which is a superposition of two coherent states .",
    "these compass states play an important role in the study of sub - planck structure @xcite .",
    "we follow the similar method in generating cat states to make a compass state .",
    "we first create the state in eq .",
    "( [ cat1 ] ) with @xmath71 , and prepare the photon state in the cavity in the form of eq .",
    "( [ photon - state ] ) .",
    "then , we switch on the effective jc interaction with a duration @xmath79 .",
    "the four phase shifts of the coherent state are yielded as @xmath80 and @xmath81 , for @xmath82 .",
    "the unitary transformation of the photon state @xmath57 is then performed .",
    "after measuring the photon state @xmath37 or @xmath61 of the cavity , the state finally becomes    @xmath83    the states @xmath84 and @xmath85 corresponds to the states after the measurement of two photon states @xmath37 and @xmath61 respectively . the state @xmath86 is a superposition of four different coherent states .",
    "the method here can be generalized to produce a superposition of more than four distinguishable coherent states .",
    "the successful realization of compass states would allow us to deepen the understanding of the decoherence problems @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a method to generate and observe a long - lived mesoscopic superpositions of two - component bec s with a high - q microwave cavity .",
    "the cat states can be quickly generated in around 100 @xmath27s if @xmath87 can attain @xmath88 khz or higher .",
    "we require the photon lifetime is much longer than the time scale of the cat states production .",
    "in addition , we point out that our scheme to generate cat states with a cavity is much more efficient than other schemes using bose - einstein condensates @xcite . in those schemes , using two - component condensates , the generated time is proportional to the self - interaction strength which is very weak @xcite .",
    "this requires a much longer production time and thus it is very unfavorable to generate cat states .",

    "the population of atoms in @xmath90 against time @xmath91 is measured .",
