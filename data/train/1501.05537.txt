    "the conception of quantum weak measurements was noticed by aharonov , albert , and vaidman ( aav ) in 1988  @xcite .",
    "the weak measurements have two key features : the couplings between the quantum systems are sufficiently weak , and the relevant observable quantities ( act as the pointers ) are measured in the properly post - selected sub - ensemble .",
    "the outcome of weak measurements is the so - called weak value @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are the initial state , post - selected state , and the observable operator of the measured system , respectively . comparing to the usual quantum measurement @xmath4 , the weak value @xmath5 could generate some interesting results  @xcite , as the post - selection @xmath2 is induced .",
    "recently , the weak value has been employed to study the foundational questions of quantum mechanics , e.g. , the hardy s paradox  @xcite , the leggett - garg inequality  @xcite , the heisenberg s uncertainty relation  @xcite , the cheshire cat  @xcite , and the superluminal velocities  @xcite .",
    "much attentions are also paid on the practical applications of the weak value , e.g. , detecting tiny values of a quantity  @xcite .",
    "considering an observable quantity depends on @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 being a small parameter )  @xcite , then the weak value @xmath5 can significantly change the pointer with @xmath8 , or say amplifying the weak signal of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "however , serval recent papers claim this amplification offering no fundamental metrological advantage , due to the necessarily reduced probability of successful post - selection  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath9 .    in this work",
    ", we recommend an useful weak value , which could reveal the hidden effects of the weak quantum interactions . here",
    "the hidden effects mean that , the @xmath7-induced changes of some observable quantities can not be detected by the usual quantum measurement ( with the total ensemble ) .",
    "however , these changes can be conditionally measured by the weak value technique . if these special observable quantities are the better ones for experimentally detecting , then the weak value technique could be considered as an effective candidate for measuring the small parameter @xmath7 of weak interaction .",
    "moreover , we prove the relevant results by a simple example which is calculated without the frequently - used weak interaction approximation , and employ the powerful experimental - system of trapped ions to simulate the weak measurements",
    ".    this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we show that the usual measurement can not detect some special effects of the weak quantum interactions . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the conditional measurements could reveal these hidden effects , and calculate an example without the usual weak interaction approximation . in sec .",
    "iv , we employ the trapped ions to simulate the weak measurement , and finally give a conclusion in sec . v.",
    "we consider the standard von neumann measurement hamiltonian @xmath10 where , @xmath11 is the planck constant divided by @xmath12 , @xmath3 and @xmath13 are respectively the operators of the qubit and the pointer ( with the coupling frequency @xmath14 between them ) . after the above interaction",
    ", the final state of the total system can be formally written as @xmath15 where , @xmath16 ( with the interaction duration @xmath17 ) describes the coupling strength between the pointer and the qubit , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the initial states of the qubit and the pointer . considering the interaction is sufficiently weak , i.e. , @xmath20 , then the final state ( 3 ) can be approximately written as @xmath21 by neglecting the high order of @xmath22 .",
    "directly , the probability of finding the pointer state @xmath23 reads @xmath24 \\\\ \\\\",

    "this approximation shows that : when @xmath28 there is no effect due to the one - order @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we say that : the observable @xmath29 is insensitive to the parameter @xmath7 , and the weak - value amplification may be useful ( when @xmath29 is favorable for experimentally detecting ) .",
    "worth of note that , if @xmath23 is the state of atoms at position @xmath30 , the observable @xmath29 can be regarded as the _  lightness \" _ of atoms beam . this is similar to the light intensity , which is proportional to @xmath31 of the maxwell field @xmath32 .",
    "specially , we consider the two - level transition operator @xmath33 and the initial state @xmath34 of the qubit . here , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the normalized coefficients of the two orthogonal states @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "this result shows that , under the condition of ( 7 ) , the @xmath7-induced effects are accurately canceled by themselves .",
