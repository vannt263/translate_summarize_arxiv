    "centaurs are a group of minor planets found in the outer solar system whose orbits are strongly perturbed as a result of crossing the paths of one or more of the giant planets ( di sisto & brunini 2007 ; galiazzo et al .",
    "objects in this dynamical class are widely thought to be former members of the so - called trans - neptunian belt ( tnb ; e.g. jewitt & luu 1993 ) or even the oort cloud ( levison et al .",
    "2001 ) , and some of them may be transitioning to become short - period comets ( e.g. levison & duncan 1997 )",
    ". however , the possible existence of trans - plutonian planets ( see e.g. trujillo & sheppard 2014 ; de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2014 ; de la fuente marcos et al . 2015 ; batygin & brown 2016 ) may affect the dynamical pathways leading to this dynamical class .",
    "this transient population features perihelia of less than 30  au , but outside the orbit of jupiter .",
    "a number of them display episodic cometary behaviour ( e.g. jewitt 2009 ) .",
    "trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) inhabit the tnb and their semi - major axes lie beyond that of neptune .",
    "tnos actively engaged in mean - motion resonances with neptune are believed to have become trapped there during planet migration , late in the giant - planet formation process ( e.g. gladman et al .",
    "issues of nomenclature in the outer solar system are discussed by e.g. gladman et al .",
    "a few percent of both centaurs and tnos are known to host binary companions ( e.g. walsh 2009 ; naoz et al .",
    "2010 ; parker 2011 ; parker et al .",
    "2011 ) .    in this paper , we present new photometric data of two centaurs 2060 chiron ( 1977 ub ) and 10199 chariklo ( 1997 cu@xmath0) and three tnos 38628 huya ( 2000 eb@xmath1 ) , 28978 ixion ( 2001 kx@xmath2 ) , and 90482 orcus ( 2004 dw ) .",
    "the observations are part of a programme focused on the study of centaurs , tnos , and their possible cometary activity .",
    "observations and data processing techniques are described in sect .",
    "chiron is revisited in sect .",
    "new data and results for chariklo are presented in sect .",

    "results are discussed and conclusions summarised in sect .",
    "the observations presented here were acquired at the las campanas observatory , between 2006 and 2011 , using the 1.0-m swope telescope equipped with the site@xmath143 @xmath15 ccd camera . in the frames ,",
    "the field of view is about @xmath16 and the pixel scale is 0.435/pixel .",
    "preliminary processing of the ccd frames was carried out using standard routines of the iraf package .",
    "both dome and sky flat - field frames were obtained in each filter ( @xmath5 ) as needed and the images were also corrected for non - linearity ( hamuy et al . 2006 ; carraro 2009 ) ; additional details can be found in galiazzo ( 2009 ) .",
    "photometric calibration of the targets including appropriate zero points and color terms computed for the individual observing nights when photometric was performed . as an example , the following relationships between the instrumental ( lower - case letters ) and the standard colours and magnitudes were adopted in the case of chariklo ( see sect .",
    "4 ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the airmass and the values of the errors associated with the various coefficients appear in parentheses .",
    "these expressions were derived merging together standard stars from three different photometric nights after checking that their apparent brightnesses were stable .",
    "second order color terms were computed , but turned out to be negligible .",
    "astrometric calibration of the ccd frames was performed using the algorithms of the _ astrometry.net _ system ( lang et al .",
    "2010 ) . in the data tables presented here , when no magnitude is provided for a given astrometric entry ( see appendix a ) ,",
    "it means that it was not computed because of the low quality of the ccd frame or the presence of stars too close ( even partially or completely blended with it ) to the photometric target . due to the sparse nature of our data ,",
    "period determination is made using one of the string - length period search algorithms , the lafler - kinman method ( lafler & kinman 1965 ; clarke 2002 ) .",
    "string - length methods are better suited for this task when only a small number of randomly spaced observations are available ( e.g. dworetsky 1983 ) .",
    "false alarm probabilities are evaluated using the bootstrap method ( e.g. press et al .",
    "2007 ) with 500 trials .",
    "discovered in 1977 , chiron is the first known centaur and one of the largest ; its diameter amounts to 218@xmath620  km , with an albedo of 16@xmath63% ( fornasier et al .",

    "2015 ; ruprecht et al .",
    "2015 ) . because of this cometary activity , its absolute magnitude changes over time ( belskaya et al .",
    "@xmath5 photometry of chiron was obtained in 2006 june and again in 2011 july  august ( but only in @xmath4 ) using the same equipment .    during the first observing run ( 2006 june 26 to 30 ) , chiron was in capricornus ; as the object s apparent sky motion during the observations was 0.11/minute and the exposure time was 400 s , the expected shift during one exposure was well within the seeing disk ( 120 ) .",
    "the average geocentric distance of chiron during the observing run was @xmath19=13.32  au , the average heliocentric distance was @xmath20=14.18  au , and the average phase angle ( earth - chiron - sun angle ) was @xmath21=23 .",

    "the errors quoted correspond to one standard deviation ( 1@xmath24 ) computed applying the usual expressions ( see e.g. wall & jenkins 2012 ) .",

    "our best fitting gives a rotational period @xmath28  h ( or a frequency of 0.183@xmath60.014 rotations per hour ) .",
    "the values of the false alarm probabilities are relatively low : the probability that there is no period with value @xmath29 is 1.6@xmath60.6% and that of the observations containing a period that is different from @xmath29 is @xmath300.01% .",

    "1989 ) and 0.044  mag in 1991 ( marcialis & buratti 1993 ) , but it was measured at 0.003@xmath60.015  mag with data obtained in 2013 ( ortiz et al .",

    "[ cha2006 ] and [ huy2006 ] ) , the smooth component seems to be roughly piecewise linear .",
    "there are multiple reasons for this behaviour , including seeing - induced variability",
    ". it may also be intrinsic to the object under study .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "6(a ) in luu & jewitt ( 1990 ) shows chiron s rotational variations superposed on a linear brightening trend and this could not be attributed to errors in the correction for atmospheric extinction ; chiron naturally exhibits short - term brightness variations ( on timescales of hours ) .",
    "luu & jewitt ( 1990 ) removed the linear trend in their fig .",
    "6(b ) to facilitate their subsequent rotational period analysis ; the brightening trend amounted to about 0.12  mag which is consistent with our fig .",
    "[ chi2006 ] , although in our case we observe dimming not brightening .",
    "unfortunately , our sparse curve does not sample the entire rotational period well and this may explain why our value of @xmath29 is somewhat smaller than the ones measured by other authors ( i.e. sheppard et al .",
    "2008 ) , although the accepted value is nearly within 1@xmath24 .",
    "however , it matches well the recent determination in fornasier et al .",

    "( 2013 ) is 5.80@xmath60.04 mag ; ours is 5.75@xmath60.06 mag which again is compatible with theirs and also with the mean value found over 20042008 ( see fig . 2 in fornasier et al .",

    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in romanishin & tegler ( 2005 )",
    ".    our photometric data are compatible with a negligible level of cometary activity at the time of the observations and we found no evidence for a comoving ( close or wide ) companion ( see sect . 8 for additional details ) . regarding the colours of this object , we only used consecutive images , or almost consecutive , on the @xmath5 filters . adopting this approach",
