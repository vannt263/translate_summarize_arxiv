    "quantum relative entropy function has many applications in the problems of classical and quantum information transfer and quantum data compression @xcite .",
    "the relative entropy has a natural interpretation in terms of the statistical distinguishability of quantum states ; closely related to this is the picture of relative entropy as a distance measure between density operators .",
    "based on the relative entropy , a nature measure of entanglement called the relative entropy of entanglement was proposed .",
    "this entanglement measure is intimately related to the entanglement of distillation by providing an upper bound for it .",
    "it tells us that the amount of entanglement in the state with its distance from the disentangled set of states . in statistical terms , the more entangled a state is the more it is distinguishable from a disentangled state@xcite . however , except for some special situations@xcite , such an entanglement measure is usually very difficult to be calculated for mixed state . for continuous variable system",
    ", it is shown that the relative entropy of entanglement is actually trace - norm continuous and hence well - defined even in this infinite - dimensional context@xcite . due to the fact that gaussian state has the merit that the logarithmic of the state operator is in the quadrature form of canonical operators , the distance of the gaussian state to gaussian state measured by the relative entropy ( gaussian relative entropy or gre )",
    "was considered @xcite .",
    "in which the second gaussian state was specified by its exponential operator matrix ( em ) , not by the usual correlation matrix ( cm ) . until now ,",
    "an explicit transform from the cm to em has not been available , make the calculation of the relative entropy between gaussian states in fact impossible .",
    "moreover , when using the gaussian relative entropy as entanglement measure , the second state should be separable .",
    "now all the separable criterions are not in the form of em .",
    "so the problems of separable criterion in the form of em or the explicit transform of cm to em need to be addressed . in this paper",
    ", i will give the explicit transform of cm to em , propose the gaussian relative entropy of entanglement ( gree ) and give the method of how to calculate it .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in section 2 , the transform of cm to em for @xmath0 decorrelation gaussian state is given with the help of symplectic transformation , further more , the direct transforms of any cm to em and em to cm are also solved due to the commutation relation of matrices .",
    "section 3 deals with gree with emphasis on the proof of theorem 2 which states that gree will achieve by gaussian state at border of separable and inseparable gaussian state sets . in section 4 ,",

    "the @xmath2 gaussian states are classified as four types , their grees are discussed . in section 6 ,",
    "conclusions and discussions are addressed .",
    "to characterize a gaussian state , we have several equivalent means , among them are : quantum characteristic function specified by first ( irrelative to the entanglement problem ) and second moments which are also called means and cm , density operator in exponential form specified by a matrix m ( exponential operator matrix or em ) , density operator in exponential form of ordered operators specified by another matrix ( ordered exponential operator matrix or oem ) .",
    "the separability of a gaussian state was obtained with cm @xcite@xcite@xcite , also with oem @xcite .",

    "theorem 1 : _ the relative entropy of entanglement is obtained when the separable state is at the border of the set of separable states and the set of inseparable states . _",
    "proof : the relative entropy is jointly convex in its arguments @xcite .",
    "that is , if @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are density operators , and @xmath111 and @xmath112 are non - negative numbers that sum to unity ( i.e. , probabilities ) , then @xmath113where @xmath114 , and @xmath95 = @xmath115 .",
    "joint convexity automatically implies convexity in each argument , so that    @xmath116    and for @xmath117 one has @xmath118 hence for a separable state @xmath95 that is not at the border one can find a new separable state with less relative entropy until the new separable state is at the border .",
    "theorem 2 : _ the gaussian relative entropy of entanglement for gaussian state is obtained when the gaussian separable state is at the border of the set of separable states and the set of inseparable states .",
    "_    proof : the idea is like this : for any given separable gaussian state @xmath119 , one needs to find a line to connect @xmath120 and the inseparable gaussian state @xmath94 with every point in the line is a gaussian state which is denoted as @xmath95 . in the line , between the separable state @xmath121 and inseparable state @xmath94 , there should be a border gaussian state .",
    "i will find such a line by continuously change the state @xmath122 in the fashion that the relative entropy of @xmath94 with respect to @xmath95 decreases monotonically .",
    "if the process of decreasing of relative entropy does not stop , then the relative entropy will go to its minimum value . because @xmath123 and with equality iff @xmath124 , so @xmath95 will eventually reach @xmath94 . in the following i will mainly prove that the decreasing process would not stop if @xmath125 .",
    "now unitary operations leave @xmath126 invariant , i.e. @xmath127 this reflects the fact that @xmath128 denote @xmath129 .",
    "the relative entropy will be    @xmath130    because @xmath131 is also a cm of some gaussian state , the uncertainty relation requires @xmath132 .",
    "hence @xmath133 , and @xmath134 denote @xmath135 .",
    "the partial derivatives of the relative entropy are    @xmath136    because @xmath137 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath138 , the partial derivative of the relative entropy with respect to @xmath138 is positive iff @xmath139 .",
    "the line designed to connect @xmath120 and @xmath140 is like so : first let us fix @xmath141 to @xmath142 , then fix all @xmath138 to @xmath143 except @xmath144 , if @xmath145 , then decrease @xmath146 until it is equal to @xmath147 , the relative entropy decreases monotonically . if @xmath148 , then increase @xmath149 until it is equal to @xmath150 , the relative entropy also decreases monotonically .",
    "now the state is with @xmath151 @xmath147 and all other @xmath152 @xmath143 .",
    "then let us make @xmath153 monotonically vary to @xmath154 while keeping the other @xmath138 fixed . at last all @xmath155 , and in every step the relative entropy decreases",
    "now the state @xmath95 is with its all symplectic eigenvalues @xmath156 but with @xmath157 still being fixed to @xmath142 .",
    "the relative entropy then will be @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the bosonic entropy function , which is a monotonically increase function of its argument , but its derivative @xmath160 decreases with @xmath161 increases .",
    "the next step of stretching the line is to change @xmath141 gradually in order that @xmath126decreases further .",
    "now @xmath162 , let us apply infinitive small symplectic transform to @xmath131 to change the state @xmath95 continuously .",
    "the infinitive small symplectic transforms will accumulate some finite symplectic transforms , which are the following six kinds : ( i ) local rotations which keep @xmath163 invariant ; ( ii)local squeezings which can be used to decrease @xmath163 to @xmath164 ; ( iii ) the first kind two mode rotations . for modes @xmath165 and @xmath57 , if the two mode cm @xmath166 ( submatrix of @xmath131 ) is arranged according to the order of canonical operators @xmath167 $ ] , the rotation will be @xmath168 , where @xmath169 .\\ ] ] before the rotation is applied , @xmath166 has already been prepared ( local squeezed ) to the form of equal diagonal elements within each mode , that is @xmath170 and the same for mode @xmath57 .",
    "the inter - mode rotation keeps @xmath171 that is the trace of the two mode cm @xmath166 invariant .",

    "the distance between @xmath173 and @xmath175 can be enlarged at most to @xmath176 by proper rotation .",
    "after such rotation , we have @xmath177 , the off diagonal elements of @xmath50 part and @xmath77 part are asymmetrized ; ( iv ) the first kind two mode squeezings @xmath178 , where @xmath179 .\\ ] ] after successive applying of ( ii ) and ( iii ) for rounds , ( numeric results indicate the a few rounds will do ) , @xmath166 will have the form with @xmath180 , @xmath181,@xmath182 , the two mode squeezing then will be used to diagonalize this part of @xmath166 matrix .",
    "the squeezing decreases @xmath183 and @xmath163 with the same amount which can be at most @xmath184 .",
    "( v ) the second kind two mode rotations which rotate @xmath185 pair and simultaneously @xmath186 pair .",
    "the rotation is similar to the first kind two mode rotation but with distance between @xmath173 and @xmath163 can be enlarged at most to @xmath187 .",
    "and one has @xmath188 after the such rotation .",
    "( vi ) the second kind two mode squeezings which squeeze @xmath185 pair and simultaneously @xmath189 pair .",
    "after successive applying of ( ii ) and ( v ) for rounds , @xmath190 will have the form with @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , the two mode squeezing then will be used to diagonalize this part of @xmath166 matrix .",
    "the squeezing decreases @xmath173 and @xmath194 with the same amount which can be at most @xmath195 .",
    "these six symplectic transforms are classified as three group : ( i ) ; ( ii)-(iii)-(iv ) ; ( ii)-(v)-(vi ) .",
    "each group aims at diagonalized 4 of the off - diagonal elements of the two mode cm while decreasing the relative entropy except the group ( i ) which keeps the relative entropy . by",
    "successively apply the three groups the relative entropy will decrease step by step before it is diagonalized .",
    "then the whole procedure of diagonalizing is applied to all other pairs of modes round and round . before @xmath131 is totally diagonalized , a way can always  be found to decrease the relative entropy .",
    "the totally diagonalized @xmath131 ( denoted as @xmath196 ) is exactly @xmath197 .",
    "this is because the original @xmath198 has the same symplectic eigenvalues with @xmath199 , so @xmath196 and @xmath197 may only differ by the interchange of mode , however the relative entropy is @xmath200 according to eq.([www ] ) .",
    "this is only possible when @xmath201 .",
    "so that @xmath95 at last reaches @xmath202 maybe the gradually changing @xmath95 passes the border of separable and inseparable sets several times , but this does not matter , the last passing meets the requirement of gree .  and",
    "theorem 2 is proved .    in finding the minimization in the border state set ,",
    "one has another question , that is , if displacement decrease the relative entropy or not ?",
    "the answer is negative .",
    "the operator is @xmath203 where @xmath204 is a real @xmath205 vector .",
    "since    @xmath206\\ ] ]    @xmath207 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while @xmath208 is positive definite ( i will elucidate it at section 5 ) , so the last term is not less than @xmath200 .",
    "the displacement can not decrease the relative entropy .    to find the gree of state @xmath94 is to find the @xmath209 matrix of a border state @xmath95 such that the relative entropy reaches its minimum .",
    "now let us turn to the @xmath1 gaussian state system .",
    "the general case of relative entropy is that @xmath199 is in its standard form but @xmath210 is not .",
    "it is no need to require that they are all in the most general form , because by the unitary invariant of relative entropy , at least one of the matrices @xmath199 and @xmath208 can be converted to any possible form . since",
