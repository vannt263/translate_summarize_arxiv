    "since classical chaos first began to be studied , a conspicuous puzzle has been how to reconcile this nonlinear , purely classical phenomenon with an underlying linear quantum theory .",
    "if we believe , as we must to be consistent , that all of physics is fundamentally quantum mechanical in nature , then we must further believe that true chaotic systems do not exist . at some point , at length scales determined by planck s",
    "constant , the deterministic uncertainties of classical chaos must give way to the probabilistic uncertainties of quantum mechanics .    but",
    "tackling these problems is not simple .",
    "the nonlinear equations of chaos are , in general , only solvable with modern high - speed computers , and their quantum analogs share this limitation .",
    "also , chaos itself encompasses two major types of behavior : hamiltonian chaos in which energy is conserved , and dissipative chaos .",
    "it is in principle straightforward to find and solve quantum equivalents to hamiltonian systems , if difficult in practice , and considerable progress has been made in recent years in understanding these systems .",
    "dissipative systems are much more foreign to quantum mechanics as it is usually studied .",
    "recently , murray gell - mann and james hartle have used the decoherence functional formalism of quantum mechanics to show how quasiclassical laws can arise from an underlying quantum theory @xcite .",
    "i applied this approach to the problem of brownian motion , demonstrating how their scheme reproduces exactly the classical langevin equation in a fairly broad class of systems @xcite .",
    "a natural next step is to apply this to systems with interesting classical behavior .",
    "since dissipation is easily and indeed naturally included in such systems , an obvious candidate for study is dissipative chaos . once a quantum system is found whose limiting behavior is equivalent to a classical chaotic system , we can study how the residual quantum mechanical effects alter the system , and what difference this makes to the classical behavior .",
    "in section ii we briefly examine the family of quantum systems from which we will draw our model , and derive the quasiclassical equations of motion for them .",
    "we then go to the limit of an infinite reservoir of oscillators with a continuum of frequencies , and specialize to the case of a forced , damped nonlinear oscillator .    in section iii",
    "we examine the classical behavior of one such system , the damped , driven duffing oscillator .",
    "there is a brief discussion of dissipative chaos , the structure of the strange attractor , and the bifurcations leading to chaos .",
    "several quantities useful for characterizing the chaotic behavior are defined : the fractal dimension and lyapunov exponents , and their relationships are examined .    in section",
    "iv we look at the decoherence functional , and define the idea of a quantum map .",
    "the system is examined as a wigner distribution , and we see how the invariant measure of the strange attractor goes over to the quantum case",
    ". problems of coarse - graining and decoherence are discussed .",
    "then we look at the system from a master equation point of view , and compare this description to the decoherence functional approach . in section v we see how the various classical quantities used to characterize chaotic behavior can be reinterpreted for our quantum system , by treating it as a classical system with noise for sufficiently coarse length scales .",
    "a few other treatments of quantum dissipative chaos are mentioned in section vi , and the differences between hamiltonian and dissipative chaos are pointed out .",
    "finally , in section vii a case is made for a general theory of quantum dissipative chaos .",
    "picking a good set of candidate systems requires some thought .",
    "many widely studied sets of chaotic equations have only a loose connection to actual physical systems ; many others are extreme coarse grainings of very complicated systems with many degrees of freedom , e.g. , fluid dynamics .",
    "it is much better to deal with comparatively simple systems , whose decoherence functionals can be calculated easily . for this reason ,",
    "i have elected to study damped driven nonlinear oscillators , which can be easily modelled as particles moving in a potential well , interacting with a reservoir of simple linear oscillators .",
    "in particular , i will concentrate on one such system , the damped , driven duffing oscillator .",
    "earlier work has chiefly considered systems with reservoirs in a thermal state . for the purpose of this model ,",
    "i wish to consider instead a system whose reservoir is initially in a coherent state .",
    "consider a system of @xmath0 harmonic oscillators .",
    "we assume them to be in a state @xmath1 , where @xmath2 represents a set of @xmath0 complex numbers @xmath3 . if @xmath4 is the annihilation operator for the @xmath5th oscillator , then @xmath6 .",
    "as shown in earlier papers @xcite , the decoherence functional for a system interacting with a reservoir is @xmath7 = & & \\exp\\biggl\\ { i(\\ss[\\xp(t ) ] - \\ss[x(t ) ] )    /\\hbar \\biggr\\ }    \\int \\delqp \\delq\\ \\delta(\\qp(t_f ) - q(t_f ) ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ \\",

    "this makes our expansion in terms of @xmath44 seem reasonable , and also causes the system to decohere , at least approximately , since @xmath45 corresponds to off - diagonal terms .",
    "the @xmath46 term occurs because of an integration by parts .",
    "we can now look at the classical system equivalent to the above quantum system , i.e. , with the same action functional and distribution of oscillators . a coherent state",
    "is often characterized as a more `` classical '' state of an oscillator than the usual fock states ; it can be thought of as the state of an oscillator begun at a given initial position and momentum , within the limits imposed by the uncertainty principle .",
    "we will begin by assuming knowledge of the trajectory of the system variable @xmath9 , and ask what the behavior of the reservoir of harmonic oscillators will be @xcite .",
    "assume that we start the oscillators in a definite state @xmath47 the interaction potential is linear , so we can treat the trajectory of the system variable @xmath9 as a simple driving force , giving us an equation of motion for the @xmath15th oscillator @xmath48 the solution to this equation is simply @xmath49    if the system is described by a lagrangian @xmath50 , then we can write down the euler - lagrange equation @xmath51 we can clearly substitute the above expression ( [ qkexpression ] ) for @xmath52 in the euler - lagrange equation to get @xmath53 @xmath54 this expression is clearly closely related to the real part of the phase in the decoherence functional , if we make the identity    @xmath55    if we write the above classical equation as @xmath56 , then the real part of the phase is just @xmath57    how do we interpret the imaginary part of the phase , however ? in treating reservoirs in an initial thermal state , we identified this term as the effect of a stochastic force @xmath58 arising due to thermal noise .",
    "however , in this system , there _ is _ no noise classically .",
    "the persistence of this term indicates a fundamental difference between the quantum and classical systems . as gell - mann and hartle point out @xcite , in the quantum system",
    "there is always noise from zero - point oscillations , unlike classical oscillators .",
    "so the actual equation of motion derived from the quantum theory is @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath58 is a stochastic force with @xmath61 , and a two - time correlation function @xmath62      in order to consider the sorts of classical systems we are concerned with , we must go to the limit of a continuum of oscillator frequencies , both classically and quantum mechanically . in doing this",
    ", we replace our sums over oscillators with integrals over a distribution function @xmath63 .",
    "the usual choice for such a @xmath63 is the debye distribution@xcite : @xmath64 the reservoir degrees of freedom will become a continuum , @xmath65 , and the eigenvalues @xmath66 will become a continuous complex function @xmath67 . in general , @xmath68 must be taken to be fairly large .",
    "more precisely , we want @xmath69 , so that the relaxation time of the reservoir is much less than the time - scale of the problem .    let s consider now the various components of @xmath70 $ ] one at a time . in the continuum limit ,",
    "we have @xmath71 we can invert the order of integration and do the @xmath24 integral , substituting ( [ debye ] ) for @xmath63 : @xmath72    now we use the fact that @xmath68 is large .",
    "this implies that the sinusoidal terms will oscillate very rapidly , so that the integral will tend to cancel out to zero .",
    "we expect the largest contribution to come in the region where @xmath73 is close to @xmath74 .",
    "thus , we expand @xmath75 about @xmath74 to get @xmath76 . substituting this into the above integral",

    "we again expand @xmath89 , @xmath90 and substitute it into ( [ imag ] ) to get @xmath91 we define a new constant @xmath92 .    at this point , someone will likely cry foul . in the real part",
    ", we kept the two lowest order terms , while in the imaginary part we kept only one !",
    "i will give three different arguments why this is legitimate :    \\1 .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath70 $ ] serve different purposes in the decoherence functional , and have different effects . a small correction to the imaginary part",
    "has only a minor effect on the level of decoherence .",
    "the inclusion of a small amount of dissipation in the real part , by contrast , leads to qualitatively different solutions .",
    "the leading order term of the real part can be absorbed into the system action by going to an effective potential @xmath82 , as we ve seen , so that we must go to the next order to observe fundamental changes in the classical equation of motion .",
    ". the imaginary part of @xmath70 $ ] corresponds to a small stochastic noise . in the above",
    "limit the two - time correlation function becomes @xmath93 . in the usual limit where @xmath94 is small , any corrections to the above correlation function",
    "would be too tiny to matter .",
    "the dissipative term lacks this factor of @xmath94 .",
    "finally , we have the terms arising from the initial condition of the reservoir variables .",
    "when we go to the continuum limit here , the discrete sum in ( [ discrete ] ) becomes an integral .",
    "if we choose @xmath95 , then we get @xmath96 where @xmath97 can be set arbitrarily by adjusting the amplitude of @xmath98 .",
    "this term has the form of a periodic driving force .",
    "we can set the phase @xmath99 to zero by making @xmath100 .",
    "physically , the presence of this term is equivalent to the system being driven by a plane wave at the frequency @xmath101 .",
    "thus , our decoherence functional becomes @xmath40 = & & \\exp { i\\over\\hbar } \\biggl\\ { \\intof dt \\biggl (    - m{\\ddot x}(t ) - { { d u^\\prime}\\over{dx}}(x(t ) ) - 2m\\gamma { \\dot x}(t )    + m q",

    "thus , we have found a quantum system equivalent ( in the appropriate limits ) to a classical nonlinear oscillator with a periodic driving force and dissipation .",
    "all that remains now is to specialize to a chaotic example .",
    "the quasiclassical equation of motion ( [ eom ] ) is a fairly general expression for a one - dimensional damped , driven system .",
    "many such systems exist which exhibit chaotic behavior for some values of the constants @xmath104 and @xmath97 .",
    "the ordinary pendulum is an example of such a system , where @xmath105 .",
    "we will be examining another system : the damped , driven duffing oscillator .",
    "this nonlinear oscillator has a polynomial potential @xmath106 we choose units to set @xmath107 .",
    "this system has the advantage of having been thoroughly studied and examined in the past , and also , since the potential is a polynomial , of not having an infinite number of nonzero deriviatives .",
    "we will later see that this is convenient , though not vital .",
    "the equation of motion is now @xmath108 the potential is double - welled ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "for some values of the constants , the oscillator undergoes periodic motion . by adjusting the frequency ,",
    "one causes the system to undergo a series of bifurcations until eventually it enters into a region of chaotic behavior , typified by the presence of a strange attractor ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "if one adjusts the driving force further and further the chaotic region is eventually left , and periodic motion returns @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to look at the long - term chaotic behavior in terms of a _ constant phase _ map or _ surface of section_. that is , we consider the position @xmath109 and momentum @xmath110 at the discrete times @xmath111 . by then plotting the values @xmath112 and @xmath113 we make the fractal structure of the strange attractor very clear ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "we are also able to bring the mathematical toolbox of discrete dynamical system theory to bear on the problem .",
    "formally , we define the constant phase map @xmath114 , @xmath115 , where * f * is an operator which evolves the point @xmath116 in phase space forward in time by @xmath117",
    ".    we can now define a probability measure @xmath118 on our phase space . in this discrete dynamics",
    ", it evolves according to the equation @xmath119 it is very useful then to consider an _ invariant measure _ , which gives a probability distribution on the strange attractor .",
    "this is defined by the equation @xmath120 for a chaotic system such as the duffing oscillator , @xmath121 will not be an analytic function ; rather , it will be a generalized function .",
    "also , it will not in general be unique ; there are many invariant measures , most corresponding to unstable solutions , fixed points or periodic points .",
    "it has been shown that the inclusion of a small amount of noise removes both of these objections , eliminating the unstable solutions and making the function analytic @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of noise effectively broadens the @xmath122-functions in ( [ measure ] ) , making it impossible for probability measure to remain poised on an unstable fixed - point solution or periodic orbit , leaving only the strange attractor as a stable set .",
    "one can therefore define the classical @xmath121 as the limit of this unique @xmath121 as the noise goes to zero ; it will still be a generalized function with a fractal structure , but now unique .",
    "note that in the quantum system , the noise is _ always _ non - zero ; we will see how this modifies our definitions in sections iv and v.    the structure of the strange attractor arises as a limit of repeated stretching and folding of phase space .",
    "as we look closer and closer at the component points of the attractor , we see repeated layers of substructure at every scale ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "such infinite substructure is commonly characterized by its _",
    "fractal dimension_. there are a number of ways of defining dimension , each of which has slightly different properties .",
    "one common definition is that of the _ capacity _ or _",
    "kolmogorov dimension _ , @xmath123 .",
    "this is calculated by means of a box - counting algorithm .",
    "phase space is divided into small cells of linear size @xmath124 , and one counts the number of cells @xmath125 which contain points of the attractor .",
    "the dimension is then @xmath126    though this definition is fairly easy to calculate numerically , it does not reflect the fact that an orbit may visit regions of the attractor with varying frequency . to take this into account",
    ", one may instead use the _ information dimension _",
    ", @xmath127 .",
    "again , phase space is divided into cells of linear dimension @xmath124 .",
    "the probability that a given point will fall in the @xmath5th cell is @xmath113 .",
    "@xmath127 is then @xmath128 if @xmath113 is equal for all cells that are visited , then @xmath129 ; otherwise @xmath130 .",
    "if one examines a small cell of phase space evolve according to our equation , it will tend to be stretched along one dimension .",
    "the overall phase space volume , however , will contract , due to the effects of dissipation .",
    "this stretching is what provides the well known signature of chaotic systems , sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "the contraction , together with the more global process of folding , is what leads to the fractal structure of the attractor .",
    "one can average these two effects over the entire attractor to calculate the lyapunov exponents . in our two - dimensional phase space",
    ", this will be a pair of numbers @xmath131 and @xmath132 , with @xmath133 characterizing the stretching and @xmath134 characterizing the contraction . since overall phase space volume is shrunk by this system , clearly @xmath135 .",
    "if our phase space was @xmath136 dimensional , there would clearly be @xmath136 characteristic exponents .",
    "lyapunov exponents are calculated by considering the time evolution of an infinitesimal frame of basis vectors in phase space .",
    "one can perform a gram - schmidt orthogonalization , separating out the most rapidly increasing direction from less rapidly increasing directions repeatedly until one has @xmath136 orthogonal vectors .",
    "one then takes the logarithm of the rate of change in each of those directions .",
    "allowing the frame to evolve for many driving cycles lets one follow a phase space cell as it samples all parts of an attractor .",
    "in this way one calculates the average values of the exponents .",
    "the values of the @xmath137 are global quantities , characterizing the attractor as a whole , or equivalently , the long - term behavior of orbits throughout the attractor .",
    "calculating the highest exponent , @xmath131 , is not very difficult . finding values for a full spectrum of exponents , however ,",
    "is rather tricky , and requires a subtle touch .",
    "i refer those interested to the papers of wolf , et al . and",
    "brown , et al .",
    "for details @xcite .",
    "these definitions for fractal dimension and lyapunov exponents run into trouble in the quantum case , where taking limits as @xmath138 is not very well - defined .",
    "we will see in section v how one can adjust these definitions appropriately .",
    "in the classical case we went from continuous to discrete dynamics by going to the constant phase map of the duffing oscillator . in considering a quantum equivalent , it is convenient to coarse - grain our selected trajectories @xmath9 and @xmath139 by considering only their values at the times @xmath111 of constant phase .",
    "the decoherence functional then becomes @xmath140 = \\int_{\\{x_i\\ } } \\delx \\int_{\\{\\xp_i\\ } } \\delxp    d[x(t),\\xp(t)],\\ ] ] where the decoherence functional on continuous trajectories @xmath141 $ ] is given by ( [ cont_decoherence ] ) .",
    "the path integrals are over all paths of @xmath9 and @xmath139 which pass through the points @xmath112 and @xmath142 respectively at times @xmath143 .",
    "such a coarse - graining is discussed by gell - mann and hartle @xcite . in general , in order for such a system to be sufficiently decoherent , we must also coarse - grain on the positions @xmath144 and @xmath145 . instead of specifying the positions exactly",
    ", we instead require just that the positions fall in one of a group of short intervals @xmath146 at the times @xmath143 . a history is then given by specifying the sequence of @xmath147 s .",
    "we ll use the short - hand notation @xmath148 for this sequence .    we can estimate the minimum length @xmath149 of such intervals by requiring that the off - diagonal terms of the decoherence functional be strongly supressed for @xmath150 . as",
    "gell - mann and hartle show , this depends on the separation between times @xmath143 , the strength of the coupling , and so forth .",
    "a rough estimate gives @xmath151 for the quantum maps the interval is @xmath152 .",
    "@xmath68 is the frequency cutoff ; it is equal to @xmath153 .",
    "so we get an estimate @xmath154    since equation ( [ cont_decoherence ] ) is expressed in terms of the variables @xmath155 and @xmath44 , it might be useful to change variables in our coarse - grained systems .",
    "as the decoherence functional is supressed for large @xmath43 , we can we can treat our integrand as being quadratic in @xmath44 , and carry out the @xmath43 integration .",
    "this gives us @xmath156 where @xmath56 is the classical equation of motion as given above in ( [ eom ] ) and @xmath157 is the initial wigner distribution , obtained by the integral over @xmath46 .",
    "we see that if the @xmath158 do not lie along a classical trajectory @xmath56 , then the functional will be supressed .",
    "so the most probable histories are those which lie along the classical trajectory .",
    "the @xmath159 path integral can not be done exactly in most cases , but one can see that in general the @xmath158 must lie near the @xmath144 for some classical problem for the probability to be of reasonable magnitude .    the wigner distribution @xmath160 ( not to be confused with the influence phase @xmath70 $ ] , which is a functional ! ) is given by @xmath161 where we see that @xmath159 and @xmath43 are our usual variables , and @xmath110 has units of momentum .",
    "@xmath160 is somewhat analogous to a probability distribution on phase space .",
    "it is real , and integrates to a total of 1 ; its primary difference from a classical phase space distribution is that it is not strictly non - negative .",
    "if we want to advance @xmath160 in time , we can define a transfer matrix @xmath162 such that @xmath163 .",

    ", we might wish instead to consider histories in which a trajectory passes through small cells in phase space , rather than just intervals in @xmath159 .",
    "we can write such a history by considering projections onto intervals in @xmath159 followed very briefly by projections onto intervals in @xmath110",

    ". the final projection will be of the form ( [ onetime ] ) .",
    "the case where the @xmath110 projection precedes the @xmath109 is very similar to the above .",
    "there are other ways of considering phase space projections , using coherent states or gaussian combinations of coherent states . a fuller discussion of phase space histories and their decoherence deserves a fuller discussion elsewhere @xcite .",
    "another common method of studying systems such as this is by means of a master equation formalism .",
    "caldeira and leggett derive such an equation in the case of a harmonic oscillator interacting with a thermal bath at relatively high temperature @xcite .",
    "their result is readily adapted to the present case , yielding the equation @xmath190 in examining this equation , the meanings of the different terms are highly intuitive .",
    "the @xmath191 term is a diffusive effect resulting from the quantum noise ; the @xmath104 term includes the effects of dissipation ; the @xmath192 is the driving force .",
    "changing to the variables @xmath159 and @xmath43 , the master equation becomes @xmath193 if @xmath43 is small , then we can expand the potential term to give us @xmath194 for the duffing potential , of course , the higher - order terms vanish .",
    "this is a convenient benefit of dealing with a polynomial potential .",
    "transforming this equation by ( [ wigner ] ) gives us a new equation for the evolution of the wigner distribution itself : @xmath195 this is almost exactly the form of the fokker - planck equation for the classical equation of motion ( [ eom ] ) , with the diffusive @xmath196 term representing the effects of the random fluctuations on the `` probability '' distribution and the third - derivative term being a purely quantum - mechanical addition , enabling @xmath160 to become negative in limited regions of phase space .",
    "to interpret this distribution as a probability , we must coarse - grain by averaging it over small volumes of phase space , producing the sort of `` smeared '' wigner distribution discussed by halliwell @xcite .",
    "this is not , of course , the full story . in order to correctly describe this system ,",
    "we need not only the time evolution of the wigner distribution , but also to specify a set of decoherent histories , as discussed in the previous section . without those histories ,",
    "it is impossible to assign classical probabilities in a consistent manner .",
    "these two approaches can be made to complement each other , however , as the master equation can be solved to yield the transfer matrix @xmath162 , defined in the previous section as a path integral . in the case of chaos",
    ", one can in general only solve these equations numerically , and the master equation formalism then has a compuational advantage over the path integral form .",
    "from the previous section , we see that the behavior of a system such as we are examining can be evaluated on many levels :    \\1 . the classical level . in the previous section we saw that all histories which deviate too far from the classical solution have their probabilities",
    "highly suppressed .",
    "if a system is large enough in scale , with enough inertia that the quantum effects are lost in other sources of uncertainty , we can treat it as approximately classical . clearly , in a chaotic system this quantum noise does cause large alterations in the overall behavior of the system , but it is often impossible to separate this from thermal noise or other sources of error .",
    "\\2 . the quasiclassical level . here",
    "we again treat the system as essentially classical , but now explicitly include the noise arising from quantum effects , which is large enough to be noticed on the scale of the system ; this is the system as described by equation ( [ eom ] ) . from a practical point of view , this is the level at which quantum effects are most easily calculated .",
    "this also overlaps the considerable work that has been done on dynamical systems with noise @xcite .",
    "note that this is _ not _ the same as a semiclassical approximation , such as wkb .",
    "\\3 . the quantum level .",
    "fundamentally , we can consider the system in terms of coarse - grainings and decoherent histories . instead of treating a system as basically classical with added noise",
    ", we consider all possible histories , and compute expectation values for classical quantities from the probabilities of those histories .",
    "we ve already discussed the classical ( level 1 ) definitions of the lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions used to characterize chaotic systems and strange attractors in section iii .",
    "as pointed out , these quantities are usually defined at least formally by calculating a quantity for the system at different levels of coarse - graining ( i.e. , different box sizes @xmath124 ) , and taking the limit as we go to finer and finer scales .",
    "while this has great mathematical power and consistency , in actual physical systems it inevitably breaks down . as benoit mandelbrot wrote on the problem of measuring coastlines with seemingly infinite levels of detail @xcite ,     to obtain a [ fractal ] koch curve , the cascade of smaller and smaller new promontories is pushed to infinity , but in nature every cascade must stop or change character . while endless promontories may exist , the notion that they are self - similar can apply only between certain limits .",
    "below the lower limit , the concept of coastline ceases to belong to geography .",
    "`` it is therefore reasonable to view the real coastline as involving two _",
    "cutoff scales_. its _ outer cutoff _",
    "@xmath68 might be the diameter of the smallest circle encompassing an island , or perhaps a continent , and the _ inner cutoff _",
    "@xmath124 might be the twenty meters mentioned  actual numerical values are hard to pinpoint , but the need for cutoffs is unquestionable . ''    as we shall see , in the case of chaotic strange attractors , the underlying quantum physics effectively provides that lower cutoff .",
    "classically , the lyapunov exponents characterize the rate at which nearby trajectories diverge as they evolve according to the equations of motion . in a chaotic system ,",
    "one expects any two trajectories , no matter how close they start , to eventually move on the strange attractor completely independently of each other .",
    "this is measured in the classical case by taking the limit as points start arbitrarily near each other and evolve for arbitrarily long lengths of time .",
    "when we allow for the presence of quantum effects , however , this definition is no longer meaningful .",
    "as points begin closer and closer to each other , the effects of noise become larger and larger ; one would expect the largest exponent to diverge in the limit as @xmath138 .",
    "as we saw in section iv , the phase space cells in a decoherent history can not be smaller than a certain size .",
    "this limit provides the lower cutoff mentioned above .    for most systems it is impossible to calculate the values of lyapunov exponents exactly .",
    "instead , one performs a numerical calculation .",
    "it is easiest to calculate the highest exponent ; lower exponents are more difficult , as their effects tend to be swamped by @xmath131 . in a numerical calculation",
    "small errors are unavoidable ; each such error will add a small admixture of the most rapidly growing component , which will quickly drown out other effects .",
    "because of this , we ll first consider only the value of @xmath131 . a simple way of estimating @xmath131 is to numerically integrate equation ( [ eom ] ) for a longer period of time , to generate a large number of points @xmath197 in phase space",
    ". one can then locate nearby points , closer than a certain cutoff @xmath124 , and trace their trajectories until they diverge further than an upper cutoff @xmath198 .",
    "one then calculates the logarithm of the average divergence rate and averages it over many such pairs of points .",
    "i have calculated this quantity in the quasiclassical case ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "it turns out that the result one calculates is not very sensitive to the upper cutoff @xmath198 , but is highly sensitive to the lower cutoff @xmath124 . in figure 4",
    "we see the measured value of @xmath131 as a function of @xmath124 for several different relative strengths of the quantum noise @xmath196 .",
    "notice how for @xmath199 @xmath131 diverges as @xmath200 .",
    "because of dissipation , the overall phase - space volume of an initial distribution tends to decrease with time .",
    "this indicates that , classically , @xmath135 . at very small length scales , however , the effects of noise counteract the effects of dissipation , causing phase - space volume to grow rather than shrink .",
    "thus , at small length scales we expect to see the sum @xmath201 become positive , and eventually approach @xmath202 ; the dimension at that length scales should also approach an integer ( 2 in this case ) .",
    "we can try to define a quantum - mechanical analog of @xmath131 .",
    "while i am not sure exactly what form such a definition should take , i can make a conjecture .",
    "suppose that we start from the invariant wigner distribution @xmath171 at @xmath203 .",
    "we divide phase space into small cells @xmath204 , centered on average positions @xmath205 in phase space .",
    "these cells have a characteristic size @xmath124 ( or area @xmath206 ) .",
    "let @xmath207 be the distance between the centers of the @xmath5th and @xmath208th cells .",
    "we can define @xmath113 to be the probability that the system is in cell @xmath209 at time @xmath210 , using equation ( [ onetime ] ) , and @xmath211 to be the probability that the system is in @xmath209 at time @xmath210 and @xmath212 at time @xmath213 , as shown in ( [ manytimes ] ) .",
    "clearly @xmath214 the probability of the system being in @xmath212 at time @xmath213 _ given _ that it was in @xmath209 at @xmath210 is @xmath215 a rough estimate of the rate of spreading is then given by @xmath216.\\ ] ]    it is nt clear whether this will agree with the usual definition of @xmath131 in the limit .",
    "this is much more a rate of expansion averaged over the attractor , whereas @xmath131 is usually defined as the rate at which nearby solutions diverge when followed for a long period of time .",
    "this latter definition has serious problems in the quantum case , where it is impossible to start solutions arbitrarily close together , and hence equally impossible to follow them for arbitrarily long periods of time without global processes ( such as folding ) becoming important .",
    "when quantum effects are very small one can approach this long - orbit definition , but in that case one is really doing a quasiclassical calculation ( like the one above in figure 4 ) , where the system can be treated as a classical stochastic equation .    numerical experiments might serve to explore the connections , if any , between these classical and quantum ideas of lyapunov exponents .",
    "i hope to do more such exploration soon .",
    "also , it is not clear to me exactly what form quantum equivalents to lower lyapunov exponents might take , nor even if such a concept is useful .",
    "these questions will soon , i hope , have at least tentative answers .",
    "the information dimension is , as we saw in section iv , another number used to characterize strange attractors .",
    "it is usually defined by a box - counting algorithm of the type given in ( [ infodim ] ) . as mentioned before , when one takes quantum mechanics into account , allowing the size of a box to go to zero",
    "no longer makes much sense .    instead ,",
    "let us consider the information dimension @xmath127 as a function of box - size : @xmath217 the probability @xmath113 is defined as before . for non - zero @xmath124 , the exact value of @xmath218 will vary slightly depending on how the boxes are chosen .",
    "this ambiguity can be eliminated by taking @xmath218 to be the minimum possible value over all possible arrangements of boxes . in practice , this makes little difference .",
    "the usual classical limit is then just the limit of @xmath218 as @xmath200 .",
    "figure 5 shows the calculated values of @xmath218 for different values of @xmath196 . as we see , at large length scales the fractal nature of the attractor is not readily apparent ; as we shrink our scale , the dimension decreases , until when dropping below the lower cutoff given by the quantum effects it abruptly turns upward again .",
    "this was calculated quasiclassically , using a long orbit with associated noise .",
    "one can also do an analogous calculation using the complete quantum theory .",
    "consider the invariant wigner distribution @xmath219 , defined in section iv .",
    "we can define the information dimension @xmath220 using the same definition ( [ d_of_eps ] ) .",
    "we divide phase space into evenly - sized cells @xmath204 of size @xmath124 , just as in the discussion of @xmath221 above , and use the expression ( [ onetime ] ) for the probability @xmath113 of being in the cell @xmath209 .",
    "again , we can eliminate ambiguity by minimizing @xmath222 over all possible divisions into cells .",
    "clearly such a dimension will not even be well defined for cells of volume less than @xmath94 , and will in general depend on the scale of the coarse - graining , just as in the quasiclassical treatment .",
    "needless to say , it is much easier to extend the information dimension @xmath127 to a probabilistic theory than it is to find an analogy for the capacity dimension @xmath123 .",
    "the presence of noise will give a small but non - zero probability of finding a point in any cell , even if it is far from the classical strange attractor .",
    "so , for quantum dissipative chaos at any rate , @xmath127 seems to be the more useful quantity .",
    "since the discovery of chaos in the 1970 s , there have been numerous attempts to look for the existence of chaos in quantum mechanical systems .",
    "almost all of these have concentrated on quantized versions of non - integrable hamiltonian systems .",
    "a seeming paradox was at the heart of the debate : chaos , as a classical phenomenon , depended entirely on the existence of nonlinear terms in the equations of motion ; yet quantum systems are by their nature completely linear .",
    "in fact , this argument is clearly invalid . while it is true that the linearity of the schrdinger equation and its relativistic generalizations implies that one would not expect chaotic behavior in the wave function itself , this has little bearing on what one would actually see if one observed such a system .",
    "one does not measure wave functions ; one measures particles .",
    "an analogous classical treatment would be to consider probability distributions in phase space rather than values of position and momentum .",
    "one can then go from a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations to a fokker - planck partial differential equation .",
    "the p.d.e .",
    "is completely linear .",
    "does this then imply that chaos can not exist in classical mechanics ?",
    "such a conclusion would be absurd .",
    "of course , wave functions are not probability distributions , so the comparison is a bit misleading .",
    "a sufficiently coarse - grained wigner distribution , however , can be made to look very much like a probability distribution , and its master equation closely resembles the fokker - planck equation , as we have seen , so comparing the two is not completely inappropriate .",
    "in fact , certain quantum models can exhibit chaos @xcite , but they are exceptional .",
    "most systems which occupy a bounded volume in phase space do eventually exhibit _ quantum recurrence _ in which the expectation values of quantities such as energy are almost periodic @xcite .",
    "a simple information - theory argument can be made for why this should be : a bounded volume in phase space @xmath223 represents a finite number of possible states @xmath224 , so one would expect the long - term behavior to be periodic or quasiperiodic . according to ehrenfest s theorem , a narrow wave packet will tend to follow the classical chaotic trajectory for a time @xmath225 until it has spread out to a size comparable to the phase space volume .",
    "thus , it is argued , one should observe a long chaotic `` transient , '' ending ultimately in periodic or almost periodic motion . as the system becomes more `` macroscopic ''",
    "the phase space volume becomes larger with respect to @xmath94 and @xmath225 becomes longer .",
    "chirikov , izrailev and shepelyansky describe the usual approach to quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "they separate the problem into two parts , the dynamics of the undisturbed wave function and the effects of measurement and wave function collapse .",
    "obviously , this periodic behavior of expectation values says nothing about what an experimenter would actually observe upon measuring the system .",
    "they compare the former with deterministic behavior and the latter with randomness and `` noise '' .",
    "clearly , an actual series of measurements would not be periodic at all , but would instead resemble a random chaotic trajectory .",
    "they further dismiss the study of dissipative chaos as a mere phenomenological approximation to an underlying hamiltonian system , e.g. , in our case including both the system and reservoir degrees of freedom .",
    "if the work of gell - mann , hartle , and others is to be believed , we should consider only decoherent histories . since hamiltonian systems almost by definition do not interact with outside degrees of freedom",
    ", one can not really talk of `` measuring '' them .",
    "if measurements are taken , the system is disturbed ; if measurements are not taken , the system evolves undisturbed , but detailed histories of the motion will not decohere . in dissipative systems , by contrast , the chaotic system is interacting continually with the neglected degrees of freedom of the reservoir .",
    "these serve to provide a continual `` measurement '' of the system , in addition to causing dissipation and noise , so that histories of the system variables do decohere , as we have seen . thus",
    ", considering these dissipative systems from a decoherence functional point of view is entirely appropriate .",
    "also , any description of real macroscopic systems must allow for coarse - graining over the many degrees of freedom of which we are ignorant .",
    "as one goes from the classical to the quantum realms , deterministic uncertainty or randomness is replaced by probabilistic uncertainty .    in the duffing oscillator model studied here ,",
    "an arbitary initial distribution @xmath226 will tend to converge onto the invariant distribution , @xmath227 @xcite .",
    "this invariant distribution is periodic , with period @xmath117 , so that @xmath228 .",
    "this resembles the idea of a long chaotic `` transient '' leading to a non - chaotic , periodic behavior .",
    "this is not , however , very different from the behavior of classical systems evolving according to the fokker - planck equation .",
    "most initial distributions @xmath229 of non - zero width evolve into the invariant probability measure @xmath121 in much the same way that @xmath230 evolves into @xmath171 in the quantum case ( see fig .",
    "the classical case is complicated by the non - analyticity and non - uniqueness of @xmath121 , so that there can be a finite probability of sitting on top of some unstable equilibrium or periodic point .",
    "an initial distribution with non - zero width will never actually become the invariant measure , of course , always itself remaining an analytic function if it begins as one , but the difference rapidly becomes too small to measure .",
    "these difficulties do not exist in the quantum case , due to the presence of noise .",
    "this difference , plus the necessity for coarse - graining ( which requires an initial distribution to have non - zero width , thanks to the uncertainty principle ) , is what distinguishes the classical and quantum cases , not the periodicity of the solution per se .",
    "the important idea is not the behavior of @xmath171 , but rather the probabilities of different possible histories of the system as described in ( [ manytimes ] ) .",
    "other authors have concentrated on the rate of expansion of uncertainty in quantum chaotic systems , and on how chaos leads to a form of `` dissipation '' in the quantum wave function itself @xcite .",
    "a very interesting suggestion arose in work by weinberg on possible nonlinear generalizations of quantum mechanics @xcite . with true nonlinearity , chaos on",
    "the level of the wave function could exist .",
    "weinberg points out , however , that any nonlinearity in the theory must be very small to be consistent with experiment , and chaos is rare in such nearly - integrable systems .",
    "while such a generalization of quantum theory is certainly not ruled out be experiment , it poses a number of troubling problems .",
    "as pointed out by polchinski @xcite , either faster - than - light transmission of information via an epr - type experiment becomes possible , or different branches of histories can continue to interact with each other , effectively making decoherence impossible . both of these , while certainly not impossible , have absolutely no basis in experimental evidence ; indeed , the latter would imply that even classical probabilities could undergo a sort of `` interference '' with each other .",
    "a few papers have been published on quantum dissipative chaos @xcite , mostly by including a phenomenological term in the schrdinger equation to model dissipation .",
    "while there is a fair bit of other work on the phenomenon of quantum dissipation itself @xcite , little of it has been applied to chaotic systems , as far as i am aware , and relatively little has been from the decoherence point of view .",
    "i can not do a broad survey of an extremely active field here .",
    "a number of good books now exist on quantum hamiltonian chaos @xcite .",
    "in this paper , i have only treated a single model in depth : the forced , damped duffing oscillator .",
    "it is clear , though , that the techniques used are easily applied to any nonlinear oscillator problem .",
    "i believe that , in general , the formalism of gell - mann and hartle provides a rigorous method for treating any classical chaotic system .    for some systems , of course ,",
    "such a treatment may be inappropriate .",
    "dissipative chaos was first discovered in attempts to model fluid dynamics ; while in principle such problems could be treated in this way , any quantum effects are likely to be so small as to be irrelevant . for nonlinear oscillators , though , the application is quite reasonable , and it is possible that experiments could be done in quantum optical or electronic systems which would correspond to classically chaotic systems of this sort .",
    "what is more , using this formalism provides a link between a quantum system and its `` classical limit '' which lets one define the idea of quantum chaos in a rigorous way . and",
    "such systems can be treated not only semi - classically , but with the full quantum laws as well .",
    "equally important , in this quasiclassical treatment we can see how chaotic systems can serve to amplify the effects of small quantum fluctuations .",
    "sensitive dependence on initial conditions  the hallmark of chaos  is an important idea in understanding _ measurement situations _ , in which minor quantum effects can become correlated with a change in macroscopic variables . in complex systems with many degrees of freedom , sensitive dependence on initial conditions is probably the rule rather than the exception .",
    "a great deal remains to be done .",
    "this formalism can readily be applied to a number of other systems besides the duffing oscillator .",
    "also , it would be valuable to develop numerical programs for solving the master equation , and calculating the quantities characterizing the attractor in the full quantum system as well as the quasiclassical limit .",
    "some work on this has already been done @xcite , but it is still in a rather crude state .",
    "but the basic outlines of the theory are clear . using the theory of gell - mann and hartle ,",
    "a rigorous treatment of quantum dissipative chaos is finally possible .",
    "i gratefully acknowledge the invaluable support of murray gell - mann and jim hartle , without whom this paper could not have been written .",

    "<S> using the decoherence formalism of gell - mann and hartle , a quantum system is found which is the equivalent of the classical dissipative chaotic duffing oscillator . the similarities and differences from the classical oscillator </S>",
    "<S> are examined ; in particular , a new concept of quantum maps is introduced , and alterations in the classical strange attractor due to the presence of scale - dependent quantum effects are studied . </S>",
    "<S> classical quantities such as the lyapunov exponents and fractal dimension are examined , and quantum analogs are suggested . </S>",
    "<S> these results are generalized into a framework for quantum dissipative chaos , and there is a a brief discussion of other work in this area .    # 1#1 | # 1| # 1 # 1#2#1 | # 2    quantum dissipative chaos    department of physics + california institute of technology + pasadena , ca 91125 </S>"
