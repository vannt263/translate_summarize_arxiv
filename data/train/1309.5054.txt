    "the theoretical analysis of transition metal oxides , including cuprates , manganites and iron pnictides , requires faithful description of strongly correlated electrons which localize due to coulomb interactions in partly filled @xmath3 orbitals.@xcite these interactions lead to mott insulators in undoped compounds , with spin and orbital degrees of freedom which interact with charge defects arising under doping @xcite  then the magnetic order and transport properties change due to subtle interplay between charge and magnetic / orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "good examples are high temperature superconductivity in cuprates,@xcite or colossal magnetoresistance in manganites.@xcite in these systems , the interaction between charge carriers and localized spins is of crucial importance and drives the observed evolution of magnetic order and transport properties , captured in double exchange mechanism.@xcite these changes may also depend on subtle quantum effects in systems with coupled spin - orbital - charge degrees of freedom.@xcite    a well known problem is the dynamics of one hole added to oxygen orbitals which interacts with @xmath4 spins at cu ions in cuo@xmath5 planes of high temperature superconductors .",
    "the spins form an antiferromagnetic ( af ) order due to the superexchange interaction .",
    "a complete treatment of this problem involes a three - band model , @xcite with cu @xmath6 orbitals occupied by one hole each and o @xmath7 orbitals along the bonds .",
    "instead , theoretical studies focus frequently on simplified treatments which do not include all quantum effects related to charge carries interacting with spin excitations in phases with magnetic order . for example , following the idea of zhang and rice,@xcite a simplified single - band model has been derived for cuo@xmath5 planes from the charge - transfer model,@xcite and next used to study the evolution of magnetic order with increasing hole doping .",
    "however , such effective models do not accurately describe the electronic states in lightly doped materials .",
    "for instance , even low doping of less than 5% charge carriers is sufficient to change the magnetic order in vanadates@xcite or in manganites.@xcite    electronic states change radically when electrons or holes propagate in a background with magnetic order .",
    "the well known example is a single hole which is classically confined in an antiferromagnet,@xcite but develops a quasiparticle propagating on the scale of superexchange by its coupling to quantum spin fluctuations.@xcite in contrast , a conduction electron in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) background propagates as a free particle , as known in fm semiconductors such as euo or eus .",
    "@xcite here the electron spin oriented in the opposite way to the fm background scatters on magnon excitations which leads to rather complex many - body problem,@xcite and to changes of the electronic structure with increasing temperature.@xcite it was pointed out@xcite that a repeated emission and reabsorption of a magnon by the conduction electron results in an effective attraction between magnon and electron .",
    "this gives rise to a polaron - like quasiparticle , the _ magnetic polaron_. another excitation is due to a direct magnon emission or absorption by the electron , thereby flipping its own spin , leading to _ scattering states_. modifications of electronic structure due to polarons were also discussed in manganites,@xcite cobaltates , @xcite and vanadates.@xcite    the purpose of this paper is to analyze the formation of polaron - like features and scattering states in a tight - binding model motivated by the physical properties known from cuprates . due to strong local coulomb repulsion @xmath8 at @xmath6 orbitals of cu ions , the model including holes in these orbitals and in the surrounding oxygen orbitals , called also a three - band model , reduces to a spin - fermion model.@xcite the latter describes an oxygen hole coupled to the neighboring spins by a kondo - like antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange interaction .",
    "this local af coupling frustrates the af superexchange in cuo@xmath5 planes and is responsible for a rapid decay of af order under increasing doping . the main difficulty in treating the dynamics of a doped hole are the af quantum fluctuations of the spin background , which have to be treated in an approximate way.@xcite    only very few many - body problems are exactly solvable .",
    "exact solutions are typically limited to one - dimensional ( 1d ) models or to a very special choice of interaction parameters .",
    "however , an exact solution ( i ) provides always important physical insights into the nature of quantum states involved , ( ii ) could serve to test approximate treatments , and ( iii ) may be used to draw useful conclusions for experimental studies .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that a hole in a fm system with a single magnon excitation provides valuable insights into the spectral properties of a doped hole moving in a spin polarized system.@xcite here we introduce a cuo@xmath9-like spin - chain model , as studied for yba@xmath5cu@xmath9o@xmath10 high temperature superconductors . recently",

    "we will use the fermion representation for spin operators in the conduction band , @xmath41 . by transforming all the fermion operators to",

    "is generally not diagonal .",
    "this is usually not a problem , since both diagonal components of the spectral function are measured at once in experiment , which corresponds to the trace of the corresponding matrix  , @xmath93 a quantity invariant under the change of basis .",
    "thus , we also present here the traced spectral function @xmath94 . in order to get more physical insight into the exact solution",
    ", we will now derive the approximate solutions of the problem , in two opposite parameter regimes , strong and weak hole - magnon coupling .",

    "the remaining state @xmath101 is a state dominated by magnons which dress an @xmath102-spin hole that propagates over @xmath15 orbitals .",
    "these definitions allow us to infer something about the approximate nature of different bands calculated from the green s function .",
    "further , because @xmath77 does not involve any three - site interaction terms but only self - renormalizing exchange interaction , there is no distinction between @xmath1 and @xmath2 orbitals , and therefore in both cases the states derived in perturbation theory   are the same . using them , one can calculate the perturbation corrections to their energy coming from @xmath23 and @xmath22 .",
    "owing to the specific orbital symmetries in the latter , in order to get a nontrivial contribution ( i.e. , dispersion ) one needs to conduct the perturbation expansion at least up to the second order .",

    "this assumption is valid provided the whole @xmath105 brings only a minor contribution to the overall energy , therefore implying @xmath106 and @xmath107 . from eq .",

    "therefore , we expect the mf solution   to resemble the free hole dispersion , shifted to the lower energy range by the appropriate value , and with an energy gap of @xmath113  indeed this is the case , as we show in a broad range of parameters in sec .",

    "we remark that the states obtained in the perturbative regime have the same splitting of @xmath123 at @xmath124 as in the mf theory , but they appear at a much lower energy due to formation of polaron states .",

    "quantum spin fluctuations enhance the binding energy roughly by @xmath125 .",

    "this state , corresponding to @xmath134 in the strong coupling regime then slowly develops while lowering further below the incoherent continuum from which it emerged . around this point",
    "the incoherent part of the spectrum develops a gap and divides into two distinct parts  the first of which has already been mentioned .",

    "looking at the mf solutions plotted against the exact results for large values of @xmath121 , one notices a surprising resemblance to the two lowest - lying states @xmath128 and @xmath134 , save for some constant energy shift .",
    "this indicates that mf approximation can give relatively good qualitative results , predicting correct dispersion for polaronic states , but introduces a systematic error , as it neglects the binding energy coming from hole - magnon interaction .",
    "this explains the huge discrepancy between mf energies and the exact energies found for the polaron states .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , while mf predicts the gap to develop monotonically , the real solution develops a gap shortly after the @xmath128 state emerges from the incoherent region of the spectrum .",

    "we have found that both of these approaches coincide quite well with the green s function solution in their respective regimes of applicability , i.e. , mean field gives realistic predictions for weak interactions , while the perturbation theory reproduces all the states reasonably well in the strong coupling regime .",

    "in addition , the mean field approach seems to recreate the shapes of the polaronic bands at the strong coupling , but highly underrates the binding energy .",
    "the perturbation solution allows us for identification of five distinct states : two well defined binding polaronic bands and one nearly dispersionless purely magnonic band , accompanied by two distinct excited polaronic states , coupled by a broad continuum .",
    "these latter excited states are much broader and have smaller spectral weights , even for very strong coupling @xmath95 , which can be understood as following from the continuum of magnon excitations .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath148 and @xmath145 states which develop beyond the mean field approximation will decrease their spectral weight with increasing value of spin @xmath11 in the ferromagnetic chain .",
