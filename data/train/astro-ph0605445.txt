    "grb 051221a was localized by the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard the _ swift _ satellite ( parsons et al .",
    "2005 ) and promptly observed by both _",
    "swift_/bat and the konus - wind instrument .",
    "the swift observations reveal this is a short hard burst , with @xmath3 s , a hard photon index @xmath4 , and a fleunce @xmath5 in the 15 - 150 kev band ( cummings et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the konus - wind cutoff power - law spectral fitting , in the 20 - 2000 kev band , shows a fluence @xmath6 , a low - energy photon index @xmath7 , and an observed peak energy @xmath8 kev ( golenetskii et al . 2005 ) . with a redshift @xmath9 ( soderberg et al .",
    "2006 ) , this burst s isotropic prompt emission energy is @xmath10 erg , using the @xmath11cdm concordance model of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .    both the x - ray ( @xmath15 s ) and the optical ( @xmath16 s ) afterglow light curves of grb051221a have been well detected , while in the radio band only one data point followed by several upper limits is available .",
    "this burst is distinguished by an x - ray flattening at @xmath17 day , which strongly suggests a significant energy injection ( soderberg et al .",
    "2006 ; burrows et al . 2006 ) . however , the nature of that energy injection is not clear . in the widely accepted double neutron star merger model for the short / hard burst , supported by the lack of detection of the bright supernova component in the current event ( soderberg et al .",
    "2006 ) , the material ejected in the merger is @xmath18 ( rosswog et al .",
    "1999 ; ruffert & janka 2001 ) . given an energy conversion efficiency @xmath19 ,",
    "the fall - back accretion of part of that material onto the central post - merger object is not likely to be able to pump energy up to @xmath20 erg , even with moderate beaming correction .",
    "so the fall - back accretion model , which may give rise to significant energy injection in the collapsar scenario of long / soft grbs ( macfadyen , woosley & heger 2001 ) , does not work in the current case .    in this letter",
    ", we ll show that the afterglow undergoing an energy injection from a millisecond pulsar with a dipole magnetic field @xmath1 gauss ( i.e. , a magnetar ) well accounts for the multi - wavelength data .",
    "the good quality x - ray flat segment thus suggests that the central engine of this short burst may be a millisecond magnetar .",
    "in the long / soft grb scenario , the energy injection caused by a millisecond pulsar has been discussed in some detail ( dai & lu 1998 ; wang & dai 2001 ; zhang & mszros 2001 ; dai 2004 ; ramirez - ruiz 2004 ; zhang et al .",
    "similarly , provided that the gravitational wave radiation is not important , the dipole radiation luminosity of a magnetar can be estimated by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the dipole magnetic field strength of the magnetar , @xmath23 is the radius of the magnetar , @xmath24 is the initial angular frequency of radiation , the subscript ",
    "@xmath25 \" represents the time measured in the burst frame , @xmath26 s is the initial spin - down timescale of the magnetar , @xmath27 is the typical moment of inertia of the magnetar ( pacini 1967 ; gunn & ostriker 1969 ) . here and throughout this text ,",
    "the convention @xmath28 has been adopted in cgs units .",
    "the energy emitted at @xmath29 will be injected into the previous grb ejecta at time @xmath30 satisfying @xmath31c d\\tau_b = c\\int^{t_b}_0 \\beta(\\tau_b ) d\\tau_b\\approx c t_b , \\label{eq : time1}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , in units of the speed of light @xmath33 , is the velocity of the ejecta moving toward us .",
    "the corresponding observer time is @xmath34d\\tau_b .",

    ".    a general energy injection form can be written as @xmath43 for @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the times when the energy injection takes place and turns off , respectively ( zhang & mszros 2001 ; zhang et al .",
    "grb ejecta s dynamical evolution , at a time @xmath47 , is significantly changed when the injected energy roughly equals to its initial kinetic energy , i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "we thus derive @xmath49 .",
    "accordingly , our magnetar model requires @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 , which leads to @xmath54 , and so @xmath55 for @xmath56 , the rate of the energy injection drops sharply or even the central supermassive magnetar has collapsed when it has lost significant part of the angular momentum , which indicates that the afterglow lightcurve flattening weakens at the time @xmath57 .",
    "so we have @xmath58 > from equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , the total injected energy could be estimated as @xmath59 .",
    "on the other hand , with and without energy injection , the contrast of forward shock x - ray emission flux can be estimated by ( kumar & piran 2000 ) @xmath60^{\\rm ( p+2)/4 } ,   \\label{eq : relation3}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the power - law index of the shocked electrons .",
    "equations ( [ eq : relation1])@xmath2([eq : relation3 ] ) are our main relations to constrain the physical parameters of the underlying magnetar .    from the x - ray observations of grb051221a , we measure @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "substitute @xmath65 and @xmath66 into equation ( 7 ) , we find @xmath67 is well consistent with the observational result @xmath68 when taking typical @xmath69 , @xmath70 ( i.e. 1 millisecond period ) , and the grb efficiency @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , the measurements of @xmath47 , @xmath72 , @xmath66 , and @xmath65 are well consistent with the constraint relation @xmath73 .",
    "_ so we conclude that the central engine may be a magnetar_. its physical parameters are @xmath74 according to the above constraint relations .",
    "an additional constraint is on the ellipticity @xmath75 of the magnetar .",
    "as shown in shapiro & teukolsky ( 1983 ) , the spin - down timescale due to the gravitational wave radiation is @xmath76 .",
    "now @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 .",
    "we interpret the apparent flattening in the x - ray light curve being caused by an energy injection from the central magnetar . yet",
    "the flattening episode is unapparent in the optical and radio bands because of limited observations .",
    "the code here to fit the multi - band lightcurves has been used in fan & piran ( 2006 ) and zhang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and has been confirmed by j. dyks independently ( dyks , zhang & fan 2006 ) .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the outflow is calculated using the formulae in huang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which are able to describe the dynamical evolution of the outflow for both the relativistic and the non - relativistic phases .",
    "one modification is that now we have taken into account the energy injection ( for instance see equation ( 12 ) of fan & piran ( 2006 ) ; see also wei , yan & fan 2006 ) .",
    "the electron energy distribution is calculated by solving the continuity equation with the power - law source function @xmath79 , normalized by a local injection rate ( moderski , sikora & bulik 2000 ) .",
    "the cooling of the electrons due to both synchrotron and inverse compton has been considered .",
    "the synchrotron radiation of the forward shock electrons on the  equal arriving surface \" ( on which the emission reaches us at the same time ) has been calculated strictly .",
    "the synchrotron self - absorption has also been taken into account strictly .",
    "we consider a uniform relativistic jet undergoing the energy injection from the central source and sweeping up its surrounding uniform medium . the energy injection has been taken as @xmath80 for @xmath81 s otherwise @xmath82 ( i.e. , we assume that the supermassive magnetar collapses when it has lost significant part of its angular momentum ) . as usual",
    ", the fractions of shock energy given to the electrons and the magnetic field ( i.e. , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) are assumed to be constant . shown in figure [ fig:051221a ]",
    "is our numerical fit in the x - ray and optical bands with the following jet parameters : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , the circumburst density @xmath88 , the half - opening angle @xmath89 , and the viewing angle @xmath90=0 ( i.e. on - beam viewing ) .",
    "( 0,220 ) ( 0,0 )    in addition , we find that a reverse shock emission component , besides the forward shock emission , should be evoked to account for the radio data , which is consistent with the finding in soderberg et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in the pulsar / magnetar energy injection scenario ,",
    "the reverse shock emission has been calculated in dai ( 2004 ) , assuming that the outflow is electron / positron pairs dominated and the reverse shock parameters are similar to , or even larger than that of the forward shock .",
    "the resulting reverse shock emission is so bright that long - time flat bump should be evident in multi - band afterglow lightcurves .",
    "this prediction is not confirmed by current observations .",
    "this puzzle , however , could be resolved if the fraction of the reverse shock energy given to the electrons is very small , as shown below .    in our numerical code ,",
    "the reverse shock dynamics / emission has not been taken into account .",
    "it is investigated analytically instead .",
    "we assume that the reverse shock emission accounting for the radio data is powered by the energy injection .",
    "following sari & piran ( 1999 ) , after the reverse shock crosses the ejecta at @xmath91 ( noted that at @xmath92 day the central magnetar collapses ) , the observed reverse shock emission flux @xmath93 for @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the typical synchrotron emission frequency of the shocked electrons and @xmath96 is the cooling frequency . on the other hand , @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "the current radio observation thus requires a @xmath99 ghz . at @xmath100 day",
    ", the ejecta is at a radius @xmath101 cm and moves with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath102 ( obtained in our numerical calculation ) , thus the comoving toroidal magnetic field of the magnetar wind is @xmath103^{1/2}\\sim 20/\\gamma_w$ ] gauss , where @xmath104 is the bulk lorentz factor of the magnetar wind . in the reverse shock phase",
    ", the toroidal magnetic field will be amplified by a factor @xmath105 for @xmath106 ( kennel & coronitti 1984 ) . on the other hand , the constraint @xmath107 yields @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the minim random lorentz factor of the electrons accelerated in the reverse shock front .",
    "such a small is adopted because in the ideal mhd shock jump condition , the random lorentz factor of the post - shock protons is proportional to @xmath110 rather than @xmath111 ( see eq .",
    "( 17 ) of fan , wei & zhang 2004b ; see also fan , wei & wang 2004a and zhang & kobayashi 2005 for numerical verification ) . ]",
    "@xmath112 $ ] requires that the fraction of shock energy given to the electrons @xmath83 is in order of @xmath113 because it is very likely that now @xmath114 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the rest mass of the electron and the proton , repsectively . taking @xmath117 and @xmath118 , we thus have @xmath119 and @xmath120 . after the reverse shock phase",
    ", the magnetic energy may be translated to the forward shock mainly by the magnetic pressure working on the initial grb ejecta and the shocked medium . however , the details are far from clear .    at @xmath121 day ,",
    "the 8.46 ghz emission flux is @xmath122 mjy .",
    "therefore the optical ( @xmath123 hz ) flux at @xmath124 day is @xmath125 .",
    "it is about one order lower than the forward shock optical emission . as for the x - ray , now @xmath126 hz , the x - ray ( at 2 kev ) flux at @xmath100 day is @xmath127 , is also significantly lower than the forward shock x - ray emission .",
    "our estimates made here are independent of the poorly known magnetized reverse shock dynamics .",
    "we thus conclude that the reverse shock x - ray / optical emission is unimportant and can be ignored .",
    "one caveat is that the dipole radiation of the magnetar is almost isotropic .",
    "the medium surrounding the magnetar but out of the grb ejecta cone would be accelerated by the energetic wind .",
    "because the energy injected into the grb ejecta is larger than that contained in the initial ejecta , the outflow contributing to the afterglow emission would be close to be an isotropic fireball rather than a highly jetted ejecta .",
    "so the magnetar energy injection model is somewhat challenged by the late jet break detected in grb 051221a . however , this puzzle could be resolved if in other directions a large amount of baryons ( @xmath128 ) ejected in the double neutron star merger have existed there , as found in the previous numerical simulations ( rosswog et al .",
    "1999 ; ruffert & janka 2001 ) . the ejected material would be accelerated by the magnetar wind to a bulk lorentz factor @xmath129 a few , provided that @xmath130 erg .",
    "this wide but only mild - relativistic outflow will give rise to a very late ( @xmath131 s after the burst ) multi - wavelength re - brightening .",
    "however , for typical parameters taken in this letter ( the isotropic energy is @xmath132 erg and the initial lorentz factor is 5.0 , i.e. , assuming the material ejected from the merger is about @xmath133 ) , the flux is not bright enough to be detectable .",
    "the emission peaks at @xmath134 s. the 0.3 - 10 kev flux is @xmath135 which is marginal for the detection of _ chandra _ , and the 8.46 ghz flux is @xmath136 mjy . both are consistent with the extrapolation of current observations ( soderberg et al .",
    "2006 ; burrows et al . 2006 ) .",
    "if an event like grb 051221a takes place much closer , for example , at @xmath137 , such very late multi - wavelength re - brightening may be detectable for _ swift _ xrt or _",
    "chandra _ and other radio telescopes .",
    "this predication could be tested in the coming months or years .",
    "short hard grbs may be powered by the merger of double neutron stars ( e.g. eichler et al .",
    "1989 ) . for grb 051221a",
    ", ruling out of bright supernova component in the late optical afterglow lightcurve suggests that the progenitor probably is not a massive star and instead is consistent with the double neutron star merger model .",
    "after the energetic merger , a black hole ( eichler et al .",
    "1989 ) , or a differentially rotating neutron star ( kluniak & ruderman 1998 ; dai et al .",
    "2006 ) , or a magnetar may be formed . among the above cases the last one",
    "is based on various dynamo mechanisms ( rossowog , ramirez - ruiz & davis 2003 ; gao & fan 2006 and references therein ) and in particular the mhd simulation of the two neutron star coalescence ( price & rosswog 2006 ) .",
    "how long can the supermassive magnetar survive ? in the general - relativistic numerical simulation ,",
    "the resulting hypermassive magnetar collapses in a very short time @xmath138 ms ( shibata et al .",
    "the hypermassive magnetar has a mass exceeding the mass limit for uniform rotating but the supermassive magnetar does not .",
    "therefore a supermassive magnetar may be able to survive in a long time as shown in duez et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in view of the uncertainties involved in the numerical simulation ,",
    "some constraints from the observation rather than just from the theoretical calculation are needed .",
    "thanks to the successful running of _ swift _ and _ chandra _ , now short grbs could be localized rapidly and their x - ray afterglows could be monitored continuously .",
    "the x - ray flat segment in grb 051221a strongly suggests a significant energy injection .",
    "such an energy injection could be well accounted for if the central engine is a millisecond pulsar with a dipole magnetic field @xmath1 gauss .",
    "the x - ray flat segment in grb 051221a thus provides us a possible evidence for a long time living magnetar formed in the double neutron star merger . in this scenario , the material ejected from the merger",
    "would be swept and accelerated by the strong magnetar wind .",
    "this wide but mild - relativistic component would give rise to a very late multi - wavelength re - brightening and might be detectable for an event like grb 051221a but much closer .",
    "we would like to point out that the magnetar energy injection model is not unique to account for the data .",
    "for example , assuming the energy carried by the material of the initial grb ejecta satisfies the relation @xmath139 ( rees & mszros 1998 ; sari & mszros 2000 ) , the x - ray afterglow lightcurve of grb 051221a could also be well reproduced ( soderberg et al .",
    "2006 ; burrows et al . 2006 ) .",
    "however , the physical process pumping such kind of energy injection , in particular in the short grb scenario , is not clear yet .",
