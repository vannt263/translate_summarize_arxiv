    "holography @xcite is used to record light waves including the amplitude and phase on a photographic plate as interference patterns , as a `` hologram , '' and reconstruct the light wave from the hologram , utilizing its interference and diffraction phenomena . to simulate light propagation on a computer , we can numerically generate computer - generated holograms ( cghs ) .",
    "cghs can generate arbitrary light waves , and therefore , are promising technology for many applications : for example , three - dimensional displays @xcite , diffractive optical elements @xcite , and the generation of arbitrary beams @xcite .    if we apply cghs to a 3d display , the technique becomes very attractive because it is difficult for other 3d display techniques to reconstruct light waves of original 3d objects prepared by computer graphics or acquired by 3d cameras such as kinect .",
    "in contrast , cgh can faithfully reconstruct the light waves .",
    "however , the computational time of cgh required for the light propagation from a 3d object hampers the realization of a practical cgh - based 3d display .",
    "many algorithms have been proposed for accelerating the computational time .",
    "these algorithms are mainly categorized by how to express a 3d object by point cloud and polygon expressions .",
    "point cloud expression is expressed by 3d objects as the aggregation of self - illuminated points .",
    "look - up table ( lut ) methods @xcite store pre - computed light waves on a cgh , and then , accumulate light waves to generate a final cgh pattern . recurrence relation methods @xcite calculate light waves on a cgh using recurrence relations , instead of directly calculating the optical path that is time - consuming . to place a 3d object near a cgh , the image hologram method @xcite accelerates the calculation of an image cgh . te wavefront recording method",
    "@xcite accelerates the calculation of a cgh to introduce a virtual plane between a 3d object and the cgh .",
    "it consists of two steps : the first step is the calculation of the virtual plane from the 3d object . in the second step ,",
    "we obtain the cgh to execute diffraction calculation from the virtual plane .",
    "polygon methods have been vigorously researched @xcite .",
    "the key to the polygon method is how to calculate tilted polygons with regards to a cgh because normal diffraction calculation only calculate parallel planes .",
    "other methods are , for example , band - limited double step fresnel diffraction @xcite to accelerate diffraction calculation , the fresnel integral method @xcite that is faster than the methods using fast fourier transform ( fft ) , the efficient calculation of color cghs using color space conversion @xcite and so forth .",
    "using hardware is an effective means to further boost computational speed for cgh because the pixels on a cgh can be calculated independently ; therefore the cgh calculation is very suitable for hardware implementation .",
    "we developed special - purpose computers for cgh to dramatically increase the computational speed @xcite .",
    "this is called `` holographic reconstruction ( horn ) '' .",
    "the horn computers designed by pipeline architecture can calculate light waves on a cgh at high speed .",
    "the horn computers were implemented on a field programmable gate array ( fpga ) board , except horn-1 and -2 . to date",
    ", we have developed six horn computers .",
    "another major hardware is the graphics processing unit ( gpu ) .",
    "recent gpus allow us to use a highly parallel processor , because the gpus have many simple processors that can execute floating - point arithmetic operations .",
    "gpus were widely used in the realm of cgh @xcite .",
    "although gpus have merits in terms of computational power and the low cost of the gpu board , we need to use special programming languages ( e.g. cuda , opencl ) to program on gpus .    in this paper , we report fast computation of cgh using xeon phi co - processors .",
    "intel very recently launched the xeon phi coprocessor @xcite that has massive x86-based processors on one chip .",
    "one of the merits of xeon phi is that we can program on the xeon phi using standard c and various libraries for parallel environments ( e.g. openmp , mpi ) .",
    "therefore , we gain much acceleration of cgh calculation with only a small amount of labor , compared with gpus . in section 2 ,",
    "we explain our cgh algorithms which are implemented on a cpu , gpu and xeon phi : recurrence relation method and wave - front recording method . in sections 3 and 4",
    ", we describe the outline of the xeon phi co - processor and the implementations of the cgh algorithms for each processor .",
    "section 5 shows the comparison of the performance and the ease of programming between the xeon phi , a cpu and gpu . in section 6",
    ", we conclude this work .",
    "we describe three algorithms for cgh calculation in point cloud expression : direct calculation , recurrence relation and wavefront recording methods .",
    "cgh can be calculated from a 3d object data generated by a 3d modeling software or actual 3d data acquired by a 3d camera such as kinect .",
    "we first describe the direct calculation .",
    "let us suppose that a virtual 3d object consists of @xmath0 point light sources .",
    "the coordinate for @xmath1-th point light source is expressed as @xmath2 .",
    "the distribution of an object light @xmath3 on a cgh can be calculated by accumulating light propagation from all of the point light sources , that is , @xmath4 where , @xmath5 is the wavelength of a reference light , and @xmath6 is the amplitude of the @xmath1-th point light source .",
    "the approximation of the distance calculation in eq.([eqn : eq_object ] ) is fresnel approximation .",
    "we call these equations _ direct calculation _ , because the calculation is the direct summation of object lights .",
    "cgh types are mainly categorized into amplitude or phase only cgh ( a.k.a .",
    "kinoform ) .",
    "we can calculate a phase only cgh by taking the phase from the complex amplitude of eq.(1 ) or ( 2 ) , @xmath7 where the operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 take the real and imaginary parts of the complex number .",
    "we calculate amplitude cghs by the interference between an object light and reference light @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the amplitude and phase of the reference light .",
    "the intensity of the interference is expressed as , @xmath13 where , * denotes complex conjugate . in amplitude cgh calculation",
    ", we can omit the first and second terms because these terms do not include the 3d information of a 3d object .",
    "therefore , we can rewrite the above equation as follows : @xmath14 where , the constant value @xmath15 can be omitted because it is not important to reconstruct the 3d object .",
    "our recurrence relation method @xcite can compute the phase components of the exponential function in eq.([eqn : eq_object ] ) by the following two recurrence relations : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 . using the recurrence relations ,",
    "the object waves on the cgh can be calculated by the following equation : @xmath19    namely , after calculating the phase at @xmath20 , we can obtain the adjacent phase at @xmath21 by eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "the calculation cost can be reduced , compared with the direct calculation of eq.([eqn : eq_object ] ) .",
    "the wavefront recording method reduces the computational complexity of cgh by two - step calculations . in the first step of the wavefront recording method",
    ", we introduce virtual plane @xmath22 between a 3d object and cgh , and record the complex amplitude from the 3d object using eq.(1 ) or ( 2 ) on the virtual plane .",
    "when placing the virtual plane near the 3d object , the object light traverses small regions on the virtual plane .",
    "therefore , the computational amount of eq.(1 ) or ( 2 ) can be reduced , compared with the case where the virtual plane is not introduced .",
    "the second step calculates the complex amplitude of 3d object light @xmath23 on the cgh using the diffraction calculation between the virtual plane and cgh .",
    "several diffraction calculations were proposed .",
    "for example , fresnel diffraction which is a well - known diffraction calculation , is as follows : @xmath24 } \\cdot { \\mathcal{f } \\biggl[h(x , y ) \\biggl ] }   \\biggl ] }   \\label{eqn : fresnel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath25}$ ] and @xmath26}$ ] are the fourier and inverse fourier operators , @xmath27 is the distance between the virtual plane and the cgh , and the impulse response @xmath28 .",
    "of course , the fourier transform can be accelerated by fft .",
    "lastly , we calculate the phase only or amplitude cgh by eq.([eqn : eq_phase ] ) or ( [ eqn : eq_intensity ] ) .",
    "the xeon phi coprocessor has many cores based on the concepts of the intel x86 architecture and offers a standard shared - memory architecture . in this work , we used xeon phi 5110p .",
    "table.[tab : spec ] shows the specification of xeon phi 5110p . as shown in table.[tab : spec ] , the xeon phi coprocessor has 60 cores and every core offers four - way simultaneous multi - threading ( smt ) .",
    "therefore , the total number of threads is 240 .",
    "in addition , every core has single instruction multiple data ( simd ) vectors with 512-bit wide , which can address the arithmetic operations of eight double - precision or sixteen single - precision floating point numbers simultaneously .",
    "figure [ fig : diagram ] shows the conceptual diagram of the xeon phi coprocessor .",
    "the xeon phi has a structure in which a bidirectional ring bus connects each core . by the ring bus ,",
    "each core can access a gddr5 memory through gddr memory controller ( gddr mc ) and other cores .",
    "each core has a private l2 cache kept fully coherent by a tag directory ( td ) .",
    "the xeon phi coprocessor is connected via a pci express bus to a host system .",
    ".specification of xeon phi 5110p . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     table [ tab : result_wrp ] shows the cgh computational times of wavefront recording method .",
    "we optimized the first step on the gpu @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : cgh ] and [ fig : reconstructed_image ] show the cgh calculated on the xeon phi and the reconstructed image , respectively .",
    "the calculation condition is as follows : the cgh size is @xmath29 [ pixels ] .",
    "the number of object points is 11,646 .",
    "the wavelength is 531.8 [ nm ] .",
    "we implemented the cgh computation on the xeon phi coprocessor by adding only a few offload pragma directives to the cpu source code , which is much easier compared with gpu programming . as a result , in the direct calculation , we succeeded in achieving calculation about 8 times faster than the cpus when we used the full 16 cpu threads , and about 13-times faster than the cpus when using the wavefront recording method . we also succeeded in achieving the fresnel diffraction calculation two - times faster than the cpus .    in all cases ,",
    "the gpu is faster than the xeon phi coprocessor .",
    "however , if we want to implement an existing code for a cpu on a gpu , it is necessary to rewrite many parts on the existing source code for the gpu .",
    "in contrast , in the xeon phi coprocessor , it is unnecessary to rewrite many parts of the existing source code by adding only a few pragma directives .",
    "therefore , we can reduce the working hours for the implementation and try various algorithms readily .",
