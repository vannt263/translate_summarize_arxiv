    "( also hd  331102 , bd+30  3704 , tyc  2656 - 3703 - 1 , @xmath11 ) is an early type ( b9.5+b9.5 ) detached , eccentric , double - lined eclipsing binary with a relatively long period of 15.33  days @xcite and nearly identical components . the first photoelectric light curve was obtained and analyzed by @xcite , but the masses could not be determined dynamically because no spectroscopic observations were available at the time .",
    "this was remedied by @xcite , who reported radial - velocity measurements for both components and analyzed them in conjunction with the @xmath12-band light curve from @xcite to obtain the absolute masses ( @xmath132.2  @xmath14 ) and radii ( @xmath131.8  @xmath15 ) with relative errors of about 4% and 2% , respectively .",
    "the system is noteworthy in that it presents a periastron advance that is dominated by the general relativistic effect , estimated to be several times larger than the classical effects due to tidal and rotational distortions .",
    "however , there has been some disagreement over the precise rate of apsidal motion , which is fairly slow and difficult to determine , and how closely it conforms to theoretical expectations .",
    "some authors have obtained good agreement with the predicted motion , while others have measured a rate of precession that is too slow , and argued that  may belong to a small group of binaries including di  her and as  cam that display similar discrepancies .",
    "past speculations about possible shortcomings of general relativity or alternative theories of gravitation that might explain the puzzle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have largely fallen out of favor , and at least in the case of di  her the `` anomalous '' apsidal motion has now been shown to be caused by the tilted spin axes of the stars relative to the axis of the orbit @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this paper is twofold .",
    "firstly , we note that the precision of the mass and radius estimates by @xcite was limited by the quality and quantity of his spectroscopic observations . in particular",
    ", the masses are not quite precise enough for a meaningful comparison with modern stellar evolution models for this important binary system ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a test that was not performed in the original study by that author .",
    "to this end we have obtained a much richer set of high - resolution spectra that allows substantial improvement in the absolute dimensions of the two stars .",
    "we also bring to bear additional light curves obtained more recently to supplement the only existing set of photometric measurements by @xcite .",
    "secondly , we wish to revisit the determination of the apsidal motion and the comparison with internal structure theory by taking advantage of all existing measurements ( light curves , radial - velocity measurements , eclipse timings ) in a self - consistent way .",
    "previously this has been done using only the measured times of eclipse .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : spectroscopy ] and section  [ sec : photometry ] describe our new spectroscopic and photometric observations of , and the times of minimum light that have the longest time coverage are presented in section  [ sec : timings ] .",
    "our combined analysis of all the data is described in section  [ sec : analysis ] , followed by a summary of the inferred physical properties of the components in section  [ sec : dimensions ] .",
    "then in section  [ sec : evolution ] we discuss the comparison of the mass , radius , and temperature determinations for  against current models of stellar evolution , and our new measurement of the rate of apsidal motion of the binary is presented in section  [ sec : apsidal ] .",
    "we end with a discussion of these results and final remarks in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "was observed spectroscopically at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) with the digital speedometer ( ds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the 1.5 m tillinghast reflector at the fred l.  whipple observatory on mount hopkins ( az ) .",
    "this instrument ( now decommissioned ) was an echelle spectrograph with a resolving power of @xmath16 equipped with a photon - counting intensified reticon detector limiting the output to a single order 45    wide centered on the b triplet at 5187   .",
    "we gathered 72 exposures between 2000 july and 2004 october with signal - to - noise ratios ranging from 20 to 49 per resolution element of 8.5  .",
    "one of the observations was obtained during an eclipse and was excluded from further analysis .",
    "reductions were performed with a custom pipeline , and the wavelength calibration was based on exposures of a thorium - argon lamp before and after each science exposure .",
    "exposures of the dusk and dawn sky were taken regularly for the purpose of monitoring instrumental drifts .",
    "all spectra are clearly double - lined .",
    "radial velocities ( rvs ) were determined by cross - correlation using the two - dimensional algorithm todcor @xcite .",
    "templates ( one for each component ) were taken from a large library of synthetic spectra based on model atmospheres by r.  l.  kurucz ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , computed for a range of temperatures ( @xmath17 ) , surface gravities ( @xmath18 ) , rotational broadenings ( @xmath19 when seen in projection ) , and metallicities ( [ m / h ] ) .",
    "the optimum templates were selected by cross - correlating each of our 71 spectra against synthetic spectra covering a wide range of parameters , and seeking the best match as measured by the maximum cross - correlation coefficient averaged over all exposures and weighted by the strength of each spectrum ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "experience has shown that the narrow wavelength coverage of our spectra introduces strong correlations between @xmath17 , @xmath20 , and [ m / h ] such that optimal matches of similar quality can be obtained by slightly increasing or decreasing these three parameters in tandem .",
    "we therefore assumed initially that the metallicity is solar , and held @xmath18 fixed at values near those determined later in our analysis ( section  [ sec : dimensions ] ) . because the grid spacing of our library in @xmath18 is 0.5  dex and the actual values ( @xmath214.25 for both stars ) are intermediate between two grid points , we repeated the determinations using @xmath18 values of 4.0 and 4.5 , and interpolated the results .",
    "similarly , the comparison with stellar evolution models described in section  [ sec : evolution ] points to a composition intermediate between @xmath22 } = 0.0 $ ] and @xmath23 , so we repeated the determinations at the lower metallicity ( for each of the two values of @xmath18 ) and again interpolated .",
    "the resulting best - fit temperatures of the slightly larger and more massive primary component ( star  1 ) and of the secondary ( star  2 ) are 10650  k and 10350  k , respectively , with estimated uncertainties of 200  k. the @xmath19 values are @xmath24 for both stars .",
    "templates near these best - fit values were used to derive the radial velocities .",
    "the flux ratio between the secondary and primary as determined with todcor is @xmath25 at the mean wavelength of our observations , 5187   .",
    "systematic errors in the radial velocities that may result from spectral lines shifting in and out of the narrow spectral window as a function of orbital phase were investigated by means of numerical simulations as described by @xcite .",
    "briefly , we generated artificial composite spectra matching each of the real spectra by combining the two templates scaled by the above flux ratio and with the proper relative doppler shifts as determined from a preliminary spectroscopic orbital solution .",
    "we then processed these artificial spectra with todcor in the same way as the real spectra , and compared the input and output doppler shifts .",
    "the differences were applied as corrections to the raw velocities measured from the real spectra , and were typically smaller than 0.5  , which is only about 1/3 of our internal errors .",
    "the final radial velocities in the heliocentric frame are listed in table  [ tab : rvs ] and include these corrections for systematics as well as small run - to - run adjustments to remove instrumental drifts , as described above .",
    "typical uncertainties are about 1.5  .",

    "the telescopes are mounted on a paramount me german equatorial mount causing images taken east of the meridian to have a 180  rotation compared to the images to the west @xcite . as the optics for each telescope",

    "therefore , the east and west images have been treated as independent time series throughout the reduction and detrending process .",
    "because of the large psf ( @xmath2112  on the sky ) , light from neighboring stars is likely to affect the photometry and must be taken to account , as described in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "the passband of these observations resembles that of a very broad @xmath40-band filter",
    ".    reductions and detrending were carried out with a dedicated pipeline that produces three types of light curves for each target star in the program : a raw extracted light curve , a `` scaled '' version that is the raw light curve with a 90-day median smoothing applied , and a detrended version that uses the trend filtering algorithm ( tfa ; * ? ? ?",
    "for a detailed description of the kelt data acquisition , reduction , and post - processing , see @xcite and @xcite . because the tfa procedures are tuned for the detection of very shallow , transit - like signals characteristic of exoplanets ,",

    "karpowicz reported three average times of minimum light for the primary and three for the secondary , each determined from plates restricted to time spans of no more than two years .",
    "though perhaps better than other photographic estimates , even those timings give very large residuals by modern standards .",
    "however , it is still possible to extract useful information from this material in the form of one average time of primary minimum and one average time of secondary minimum for the entire series .",
    "this can be done by using all of karpowicz original photographic measurements together , which allows more complete coverage of the eclipses and therefore a better definition of the minima .",
    "the apsidal motion is slow enough that any change in the separation between primary and secondary eclipse over the four - year interval of these observations is small compared to the uncertainties .",
    "we proceeded as follows .",
    "we phase - folded the 161 brightness measurements with a preliminary ephemeris based on the analysis below , and then fit the primary and secondary eclipses separately using as a template a model light curve from a preliminary solution to the @xmath12-band data of @xcite . after applying a vertical offset to the template by eye , we allowed only a horizontal ( phase ) shift to fit each eclipse ( keeping the shape fixed ) , and finally converted the phase shifts back to time units .",

    "one expects the times of secondary minimum to be more precisely determined than those of primary minimum for , on account of the much shorter duration of the secondary eclipse ( 6  hours ) compared to the primary ( 16  hours ) caused by the large eccentricity and orientation of the orbit .",

    "the various data sets available for  are complementary in many ways .",
    "for example , the light curve of @xcite is of high quality but has incomplete coverage of the primary eclipse . the kelt data , on the other hand , have somewhat lower precision but offer essentially complete coverage of all phases , aiding in determining some of the geometric properties of the orbit .",
