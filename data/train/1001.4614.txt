    "quantum systems with well - isolated two - level subsystems that can be addressed independently , with states that can be initialized and manipulated , enjoy much interest nowadays because of possible use as quantum bits in quantum information processing .",
    "quantum - state manipulation is usually described by time - dependent hamiltonians , and the time - dependent ( driving ) part of the hamiltonian can either be weak or strong .",
    "weak driving is the default situation , but here the focus will be on strongly driven quantum systems .    in the weak - driving regime , the effect of faster and larger - amplitude driving may be the same as of slow small - amplitude driving , as only the area under the pulse is important .",
    "this is well known for example for @xmath0-pulses , which are used to invert the population of a qubit .",
    "since decoherence sets the time scale within which quantum information processing should occur , it is then a good idea to speed up quantum state manipulation by making pulses shorter , with an amplitude of the pulses that grows concomitantly to keep the same pulse area .",
    "this strategy works until the peak amplitude grows so large that the driving can no longer be considered weak , and the dynamics becomes more complex .",
    "nevertheless , it may be a good idea to go to the strong - driving regime to seek new ways to manipulate qubits fast compared to the decoherence time  @xcite .",
    "the strong - driving limit has not been studied extensively in a quantum information perspective .",
    "important was the discovery of dynamical decoupling of open quantum systems from their environments  @xcite .",
    "the recent advent of novel types of qubits with strong couplings to cavities and external fields naturally drives the interest in strongly driven quantum systems , for example in the context of amplitude spectroscopy of superconducting qubits  @xcite and optomechanical systems  @xcite .    actually , the interest in strongly driven quantum systems dates back before quantum information theory .",
    "the strong - coupling regime was studied for example in chemical physics , in order to control a molecular reaction by intense laser pulses  @xcite .",
    "many strongly driven quantum systems exhibit common phenomena for which there is no analogy in the weak - driving limit .",
    "one such universal phenomenon is _ coherent destruction of tunneling _ ( cdt ) , which was discovered theoretically and explained in 1991 by grossmann , dittrich , jung , and hnggi  @xcite . for a qubit",
    ", it is the phenomenon that a tunneling between the two quantum states is brought to a standstill by strong driving , but only for specific values of the quotient of driving amplitude and frequency ( details given below ) . for other parameter values ,",
    "the tunneling amplitude is renormalized , though not ` destructed ' , due to the driving .",
    "an explanation of cdt in terms of destructive interference of multiple landau - zener - st \" uckelberg transitions was given by kayanuma soon after  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "cdt is currently actively studied in several subfields of physics .",
    "here i only mention a few recent developments .",
    "the recent single - particle tunneling experiment on strongly driven metastable argon in optical double - well potentials  @xcite is a very direct observation of cdt , and close in spirit to the original theoretical papers  @xcite .",
    "very interesting are recent many - body generalizations of cdt , both theoretical predictions  @xcite and experimental demonstrations  @xcite . for example , for a driven bose - einstein condensate in a double well",
    ", many - body cdt phenomena are predicted that sensitively depend on the number of particles that have already tunneled  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for bose - einstein condensates in shaken optical lattices , it was predicted  @xcite and shown experimentally  @xcite that the shaking - induced renormalization of the tunneling parameter enables the switching between the superfluid and the insulator state .",
    "interesting is also the recent proposal for routing of quantum information by employing coherent destruction of tunneling in chains of qubits  @xcite .",
    "moreover , coherent destruction of tunneling is also seen in optics , in particular in coupled - waveguide structures  @xcite , for which the coupled spatial wave equations have the same mathematical form as the temporal equations of motion for quantum systems exhibiting cdt  @xcite",
    ". further work on cdt can be found in the reviews  @xcite .",
    "the standard system for observing cdt is a harmonically driven two - level system . with fast manipulation of qubits in mind ,",
    "here we consider driving by pulses instead , allowing for several types of pulse envelopes , and discuss the possibility of observing and exploiting cdt for quantum information processing in this more complex case .",
    "related work on pulsed systems can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we then apply our analysis to nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center spin qubits in diamond strongly driven by microwave pulses .",
    "this is a very promising type of solid - state qubit for several reasons  @xcite .",
    "for example , its coherence time is long even at room temperature , and its state can be initialized by optical pumping .",
    "and one can transfer its state to even longer - lived nuclear spins  @xcite .",
    "nv center spin qubits may become building blocks of a quantum repeater  @xcite .",
    "achieving coherent coupling between nv centers and superconducting flux qubits is another exciting possibility  @xcite .",
    "although our results are general , the very recent measurements by fuchs _ et al . _  @xcite have shown a great level of control of the fast and strong microwave pulses by which nv center spin qubits can be prepared in desired quantum states , and were the main motivation for carrying out the research presented here .",
    "we discuss under what circumstances cdt in nv center spin qubits could be observed , and present analytical results that can be of help to prepare final quantum states using short resonant pulses .",

    "for example , one can choose a static magnetic field @xmath154 that lifts the @xmath142 degeneracy by an amount @xmath155 and a driving field with a frequency @xmath6 that is resonant with the @xmath156 transition and an amplitude @xmath157 .",
    "then , if the system starts in the @xmath141 level , then typically the population of the @xmath158 level is negligible at all times .",
    "this is the situation in the recent experiments by fuchs _",
    "et al . _",
    "notice that the energy @xmath159 for all field strengths @xmath160 .",
    "after redefinition of the zero of energy , the effective two - level hamiltonian is @xmath161,\\ ] ] with @xmath162 . in order to bring this hamiltonian in the standard form of the cdt hamiltonian",
    ", we rotate to a new basis where the pauli matrices are @xmath163 and where the driving pulse couples to @xmath164 . in the new basis ,",
    "the effective two - level hamiltonian becomes ( case  1 ) : @xmath165 this hamiltonian for a driven spin qubit in diamond is of the general form of eq .",
    "( [ cdthamiltonianstandard ] ) , with the transition frequency @xmath3 given by @xmath166 and the interaction @xmath167 .",
    "the factor @xmath150 in the driving amplitude canceled against the normalization factor of @xmath168 .",
    "it is important to notice that the hamiltonian  ( [ hdiamondcdt ] ) can easily be changed upon variation of external parameters .",
    "for example , the relative quantity @xmath169 is fully controlled by the angle of the driving interaction with the @xmath143-axis , and can assume all values .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are both changed upon variation of the external magnetic field @xmath160 , while the strength @xmath25 of the driving field @xmath170 is independently controlled by the input power .    instead of driving the nv center off - axis",
    ", one could also drive it along the @xmath143-axis ( @xmath171 ) , and apply a small static magnetic field @xmath172 in the @xmath173-direction .",
    "as before , a larger static @xmath160 field is to be applied to split the @xmath142 levels . in this case , the hamiltonian after two - level approximation is ( case  2 ) : @xmath174 advantage of the second case may be that @xmath175 and @xmath176 can be varied independently , each by their own external parameter @xmath177 .",
    "the cases 1 and 2 are two ways to realize the standard cdt hamiltonian for driven spin qubits in nv centers in diamond .",
    "strongly pulsed driving of nv center spin qubits for case 1 was reported very recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for some strong and fast pulses the qubit changed state very rapidly , with possible ultrafast quantum state preparation applications .",
    "the experiments show that a great level of control can be achieved of the large - amplitude pulses that drive the long - lived nv center .",
    "the parameter regime was not the same as discussed here , mainly because the driving was chosen to make an angle @xmath178 with the @xmath143-axis , which according to eq .",
    "( [ hdiamondcdt ] ) means a strong static interaction in the cdt hamiltonian with @xmath179 .",
    "the approximate treatment adopted here is valid in the rather opposite @xmath71 limit . as a consequence ,",
    "the short pulses that we found in this regime to invert the population are not quite as short as found in the experiments of ref .",
    "the advantage on the other hand of the @xmath71 regime is that it can be beneficial to design the right pulses with the help of analytical predictions for their effects on a qubit , such as presented here .",
    "another difference is that the current maximal experimental value of @xmath52 is @xmath180 .",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ finalgauss ] , this enables one to invert qubit populations fast with pulses with @xmath181 and @xmath182 , while some of the phenomena discussed above require even higher values of @xmath52 .",
    "thus the driving reported in ref .",
    "@xcite is strong , but not quite as strong as would be needed to observe coherent destruction of tunneling .",
    "it is therefore an interesting question whether ( instantaneous ) coherent destruction of tunneling could be observed in nv center spin qubits . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figicdtfig ] , the smallest value of @xmath52 for which cdt would occur for the @xmath183 resonance is @xmath184 .",
    "achieving this is challenging and would require making @xmath3 smaller by increasing @xmath160 somewhat more , and by working with slightly higher pump powers at the lower resonant frequency . in case 1",
    "it would also require to drive at a small but nonzero angle with respect to the @xmath143 axis , so that @xmath185 . in case 2 ,",
    "again smaller resonance frequencies due to larger magnetic field @xmath160 and larger powers would be needed , in combination with a small static @xmath172-field . for fixed @xmath52 , there is freedom to choose @xmath25 and @xmath6 such as to optimize the validity of the two - level approximation .",
    "similarly , in case of pulsed driving with @xmath52 somewhat increased and @xmath186 reduced as compared to the recent experiments  @xcite , the icdt phenomena as discussed in this article are predicted to show up in strongly driven nv center qubits in diamond .",
    "cdt by harmonic driving can serve as a useful method to lock a qubit with degenerate energy levels in a desired state , even in the presence of static couplings that otherwise would lead to tunneling .",
    "for the nv center , the static magnetic field @xmath187 can be increased from the @xmath188 of ref .",
    "@xcite to @xmath189 ( a slightly higher increase than what is needed above ) , so that @xmath190 vanishes and the @xmath191 levels become degenerate . in case i",
    ", the tunnel coupling also vanishes with @xmath190 .",
    "unwanted static tunneling terms @xmath192 in the hamiltonian could nevertheless lead to tunneling , but driving with parameters such that @xmath193 can prevent this .",
    "the smallest driving amplitude for which this occurs is @xmath194 .",
    "a first demonstration of quantum state preservation by cdt in nvs seems simpler in case ii , where the effective tunnel coupling @xmath195 can be tuned both by the static magnetic field @xmath196 and by the driving .",
    "importantly from a quantum information perspective , the qubit state to be preserved can be an arbitrary superposition , the coherence of which would not get lost while driving , at least on time scales that noise in the strong driving is negligible .",
    "this stabilization application of cdt is the opposite of fast manipulation .",
    "of course it is equally important to be able to keep a qubit in a certain state as it is to be able to change its state , and both can be achieved by appropriately chosen strong high - frequency driving .",
    "in summary , the dynamics of qubits was studied that are resonantly driven by strong pulses . starting with a simple pulse shape that allowed an analytical treatment ,",
    "the parameter regime was explored in which the rotating - wave and slowly - varying amplitude approximations are valid in case of strong resonant driving . in that regime ,",
    "accurate solutions in closed form were presented for the strongly driven dynamics .",
    "coherent destruction of tunneling  @xcite was seen to be at work in the population dynamics of strongly pulsed qubits around specific instances in time , and this phenomenon could be called instantaneous coherent destruction of tunneling , or icdt .",
    "the closed solution of the approximate dynamics allows a simple method of pulse shaping in the large - amplitude driving regime , to prepare final quantum states using short resonant pulses .",
    "it was shown that the specific shape of the pulse is not important as long as one makes sure that a certain time integral  ( [ phidef ] ) has an intended value .",
    "the strong pulses that were were found to invert the qubit population fast can be seen as generalizations of @xmath0-pulses for strong driving . in other words , this is another strong - driving method in the quantum state preparation toolbox , complementary to the novel method of ref .",
    "@xcite . in specific applications ,",
    "their merits are to be compared with other methods to invert a spin , for example robust adiabatic passage schemes based on chirped pulses ( used for calibration in  @xcite ) .",
    "finally it was argued that the method of quantum state preservation by cdt and the pulse - shaping method discussed in this paper occur in a parameter regime that might soon be explored and used experimentally with nv center spin qubits , and there are good prospects of observing the phenomenon of instantaneous coherent destruction of tunneling .",
