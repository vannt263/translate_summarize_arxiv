    "since its isolation for the first time in 2004,@xcite graphene , a two - dimensional ( 2d ) single - layer of carbon atoms , has attracted an explosion of interest@xcite due to both its fundamental physics and its potential technological applications .",
    "in contrast to ordinary semiconductors , the application of a strong perpendicular magnetic field on pristine graphene results in an energetic quantization proportional to the square root of external magnetic field with the existence of a true zero - energy sharing equally by electrons and holes . as a result ,",
    "magnetotransport in graphene may exhibits unusual properties . for example , the unique quantum hall effect in graphene showing half - integer hall plateaus,@xcite has become the experimental evidence of massless linear - energy fermionic excitation .    similarly , the resistivity minima of shubnikov - de hass oscillation ( sdho ) of graphene appears when filling factor equals @xmath1 with @xmath2 an integer .",
    "recently , tan _",
    "et al._@xcite found that in addition to the damp of oscillation due to elevated carrier temperature , a phase inversion of the differential magnetoresistivity occurs under dc bias in graphene with relatively low zero - field mobility , i.e. sdho maxima ( minima ) invert to minima ( maxima ) .",
    "they attributed the observed interesting phenomenon to the elevated electron temperature .",
    "the dominant energy dissipation they referred arises from the diffusion of hot carriers to electrodes .",
    "however , when a graphene is on a polar substrate , inelastic carrier scattering with surface optical phonons ( so phonons ) is important and offers an intrinsic energy - dissipation mechanism.@xcite this notable phase - inversion effect has also been observed experimentally in usual two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with high mobility.@xcite so far , a microscopic theoretical analysis including carrier ",
    "phonon scattering effect on dc - current - induced phase inversion of sdho has still been lacking even for parabolic energy - band system .",
    "the magnetoresistance oscillation directly induced by a dc current , periodic in current density and in inverse magnetic field , is another noteworthy nonlinear transport phenomenon , which was first observed a decade ago in conventional 2deg.@xcite the effect is ascribed to the zener tunneling between hall - field - tilted landau levels due to short - range ( sr ) impurity scattering.@xcite later , by including inelastic phonon scattering , a microscopic balance - equation scheme has been constructed , conveniently accounting for this current - induced nonlinear transport phenomenon with considering the electron heating.@xcite so far , however , investigations of nonlinear magnetoresistance oscillation have been carried out only for high - mobility 2degs with parabolic energy dispersion.@xcite owing to the absence of much of extrinsic impurities and so phonons , the suspended graphene can achieve relatively high mobility@xcite that landau levels can be well resolved even in quite a weak magnetic field .",
    "hence , it is expected that this kind of nonlinear magnetoresistance oscillation could been observed in suspended graphene .",
    "therefore , an efficient scheme capable of dealing with magnetotransport in graphene under an external current bias is in sore need .    the balance - equation approach , which is especially suitable to deal with current - controlled nonlinear transport , was established based on the separation of the center - of - mass motion from the relative carrier motion in parabolic energy - band systems.@xcite it turns out that this scheme can be applied to systems with linear energy dispersion.@xcite in this paper , we will generalize this scheme to graphene subject to a magnetic field and a finite dc current .",
