    "they then restricted their attention to a family of correlation functions @xmath20 that could be specified by a single parameter , @xmath0 , and estimated @xmath0 for their galaxy population by finding the value that made @xmath21 .",

    "the main conclusions are summarized and discussed in   [ sec : summary ] . to motivate the discussion ,",
    "i begin in ",
    "[ sec : awry ] with an example that shows the standard analysis of redshift pair - counts going badly awry .",
    "the analyzed sample consists of the 747 lyman - break galaxies with apparent magnitude @xmath25 in the fields 3c324 , b20902 , cdfa , cdfb , dsf2237a , dsf2237b , hdf , q0201 , q0256 , q0302 , q0933 , q1422 , ssa22a , ssa22b , and westphal whose spectroscopic redshifts were published by steidel et al . ( 2003 ) .",
    "the size of the observed fields varied but was typically @xmath26 .",
    "i calculated the observed number of pairs with comoving radial separation @xmath27 mpc in each field individually .",
    "summing over all fields , a total of @xmath28 pairs were found with comoving radial separations in this range . since the lyman - break technique selects galaxies over a broad range of redshifts @xmath29 , i approximated the selection function @xmath10 as a gaussian with mean redshift @xmath30 and standard deviation @xmath31 . to calculate the expected number of pairs with @xmath27 mpc in the @xmath32th field for a given value of @xmath0",
    ", i inserted this selection function into equation  [ eq : blain ] , assumed a correlation function slope of @xmath33 , and integrated numerically over the field s solid angle @xmath11 .",
    "i set the expected total number of pairs @xmath34 equal to the sum of the expected number for each individual field .",
    "a value of @xmath35 mpc was required for @xmath6 to equal @xmath4 , while @xmath36 mpc made @xmath37 and @xmath38 mpc made @xmath39 .",
    "i conclude that the correlation length for lyman - break galaxies is @xmath40 mpc at the @xmath22 level .    as noted in the abstract ,",
    "this estimate of @xmath0 is roughly 20@xmath41 away from the value of @xmath42 mpc measured by adelberger et al .",
    "what went wrong ?",
    "most of the error in the previous section s estimate of @xmath0 came from the inaccurate model of the redshift selection function .",
    "although it is not always acknowledged in analyses of this sort , assumptions about the selection function have a critical effect on the results .",
    "figure  [ fig : r0_vs_sigsel ] shows that in the example of   [ sec : awry ] the best - fit value of @xmath0 changes by more than an order of magnitude as the assumed width of the gaussian selection function increases from @xmath43 to @xmath44 . if we had adopted the correct width @xmath45 ( adelberger et al . 2004 ) instead of @xmath31 , we would have found @xmath46 instead of @xmath47 mpc  significantly closer to the true value @xmath48 mpc .",
    "unfortunately analyses similar to the one in ",
    "[ sec : awry ] are usually attempted when the sample size is extremely small , too small for @xmath49 to be determined empirically . in this case",
    "it is difficult to know which to adopt among the possible values of @xmath0 suggested by plots similar to figure  [ fig : r0_vs_sigsel ] .",
    "although theoretical arguments may provide a reasonable estimate of the selection - function shape , it seems sensible to reduce as far as possible the dependence of the answer on the assumed shape .",
    "approximating the selection function as a boxcar with half - width @xmath50 , equation  [ eq : blain ] can be rewritten @xmath51 \\label{eq : nexpxibar}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is an uninteresting constant and @xmath24 is the spatially - averaged correlation function defined by equation  [ eq : blain ] .",
    "this form makes it easy to see why the implied value of @xmath0 can be so strongly affected by the assumed selection function .",
    "if the field size @xmath11 or redshift separation @xmath53 is large compared to @xmath0 , as is usually the case , @xmath24 will be significantly less than unity . the change in @xmath6 that accompanies a significant change in the correlation strength , @xmath54 , will therefore be considerably smaller than the change in @xmath6 that accompanies significant changes in @xmath50 , @xmath55 , and minor errors in the assumed selection function will lead to major errors in the inferred value of @xmath0 .",
    "although these results were derived for a boxcar selection function , similar results hold for other types .",
    "one way to reduce the method s sensitivity to the selection function is to design the experiment to maximize @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath24 increases as @xmath11 decreases , experiments with smaller fields - of - view are less affected by uncertainties in the selection function . in practice , however , the field - of - view is set by the instrument that is used and observers are unlikely to want to discard much of their data . decreasing @xmath53 is a more palatable option , but , owing to peculiar velocities and to uncertainties in galaxies measured redshifts , it can not be decreased arbitrarily far before genuine pairs begin to be missed .",
    "@xmath56 comoving mpc is a rough lower limit for most surveys .",
    "unfortunately this limit is large enough to ensure @xmath57 for likely fields - of - view .",
    "another way is to use the statistic @xmath58 ( adelberger et al .",
    "2004 ) instead of @xmath4 in the analysis .",
    "this adds noise but removes the sensitivity to the selection function almost completely .",
    "the approach is described in more detail below (    [ sec : alternatives ] and  [ sec : gif ] ) .",
    "an additional shortcoming of equation  [ eq : blain ] is its assumption that the sources with measured redshifts have unknown angular positions that are distributed uniformly across the observed region @xmath11 ( see   [ sec : case3 ] ) .",
    "in fact the angular positions are known ( how else were redshifts measured ? ) and are probably not uniformly distributed .",
    "consider , for example , a situation where we obtained images across a region with radius @xmath59 , but were able to measure redshifts for only 2 galaxies .",
    "if these galaxies happened to have an angular separation of @xmath60 , they would be likely to lie at nearly the same redshift even if @xmath0 were small , while if they had a separation of @xmath61 they would be unlikely to lie at the same redshift even if @xmath0 were large ( figure  [ fig : pzlt20 ] ) .",
    "since the expected number of close redshift pairs for a known correlation length @xmath0 depends on the galaxies angular separations , our attempts to infer @xmath0 from the number of pairs will be improved if we take the galaxies actual separations into account .",
    "neglecting this information adds noise to the analysis and can bias the results if the spectroscopically observed galaxies were not chosen at random .",
    "figure  [ fig : spikealign ] illustrates another source of noise .",
    "suppose we have found a single galaxy at redshift @xmath62 .",
    "how many other galaxies should we expect to find in the redshift interval @xmath63 for an assumed value of @xmath0 ?",
    "the answer depends on the distance between @xmath62 and the peak of the selection function .",
    "if @xmath62 lies near the peak , we would expect a large number of pairs even if @xmath0 were small ; if @xmath62 lies in the wings we would expect few pairs even if @xmath0 were large . since the galaxies in pencil beam surveys tend to lie in a small number of prominent spikes in the redshift histogram , the expected number of redshift pairs is strongly affected by the alignment or misalignment of the spikes with the peak of the selection function .",
    "equation  [ eq : blain ] is noisier than it needs to be because it ignores the locations of redshift spikes when calculating @xmath6 .",
    "this section suggests alternate approaches that are less affected by the shortcomings discussed above .",
    "the first two are refinements in the calculation of @xmath6 ; the last relies on a slightly different statistic .",
    "the notation we use is explained more fully in the appendix .    as shown in the appendix , equation",
    "[ eq : blain ] ( in its correctly normalized form , equation  [ eq : nexpgivennothing ] ) gives the number of redshift pairs one should expect to observe given only the information that @xmath9 galaxies lie somewhere in the field of view @xmath11 .",
    "but what if we know angular positions of the sources ?",
    "how does this change @xmath6 ?",
    "if @xmath64 is the probability that a galaxy pair with angular separation @xmath65 has comoving radial separation @xmath66 , then the expected total number of redshift - pairs should be equal to the sum over all pairs of @xmath64 : @xmath67 this equation can be evaluated with the help of equation  [ eq : pzgiventheta ] . using it in place of equation  [ eq : blain ] will remove the noise and bias that arises from the angular positions of the sources .",
    "the estimated correlation length of lyman - break galaxies in our example analysis (   [ sec : awry ] ) , reduced from @xmath68 mpc to @xmath69 mpc by the adoption of the correct selection function , is further reduced to @xmath70 mpc when equation  [ eq : nexpgiventheta ] is used instead of equation  [ eq : blain ] . the reduction from @xmath71 to @xmath70 mpc results partly from the fact the angular positions of galaxies with measured redshifts were clumped together into slitmask - sized regions , not distributed randomly across the field .",
    "how can we incorporate knowledge of the spike redshifts into the analysis ?",
    "suppose we know that one member of a galaxy pair with angular separation @xmath65 has the redshift @xmath72 .",
    "then the probability @xmath73 that the galaxies have radial separation @xmath66 is given by equation  [ eq : pzgiventhetaz ] .",
    "the expected total number of pairs in the sample with redshift separation less than @xmath74 should therefore be equal to the sum of the probabilities for each unique pair , @xmath75 using equation  [ eq : nexpgiventhetaz ] instead of equation  [ eq : nexpgiventheta ] further reduces the estimated correlation length ( in the example of    [ sec : awry ] ) to @xmath76 mpc .    equations  [ eq : nexpgiventheta ] and  [ eq : nexpgiventhetaz ] are as sensitive to errors in the selection function as equation  [ eq : blain ] .",
    "this sensitivity can be eliminated almost completely by using the @xmath58 statistic of adelberger et al .",
    "( 2004 ) rather than @xmath4 in the analysis .",
    "letting @xmath77 stand for the observed number of pairs with comoving radial separation @xmath78 , @xmath58 is the ratio @xmath79 as long as @xmath80 is large enough that @xmath81 @xmath58 will have expectation value @xmath82 ( in this equation , @xmath83 can be calculated with equation  [ eq : nexpgiventheta ] , equation  [ eq : nexpgiventhetaz ] , or any number of variants ; the value of @xmath58 will not change significantly . ) adelberger et al .",
    "( 2004 ) show that the right - hand size of equation  [ eq : expk ] is almost entirely independent of the assumed selection - function width @xmath49 when @xmath84 is small compared to @xmath49 .",
    "if we find the value of @xmath0 that makes the right - hand side of equation  [ eq : expk ] equal the right - hand side of equation  [ eq : defk ] , we will have an estimate of the correlation length whose value does not depend on our assumptions about the selection function .",
    "this is our final approach to estimating @xmath0 . applying it to the lyman - break galaxy example of ",
    "[ sec : awry ] leads to an estimate @xmath85 mpc that agrees well with the correlation length reported by adelberger et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the correlation lengths estimated with equation  [ eq : nexpgiventhetaz ] and  [ eq : expk ] shows that the observed number of pairs with @xmath86 is inconsistent with the hypothesis @xmath87 mpc that seemed ( according to equation  [ eq : nexpgiventhetaz ] ) to account for the number of pairs with @xmath88 .",
    "this may indicate that the assumed selection function is incorrect or that the power - law @xmath89 is a poor approximation to the correlation function for large separations .",
    "the estimate of @xmath0 will be made more robust against either possibility by limiting the analysis to pairs with smaller separations , say @xmath90 . in this case",
    "the estimated correlation lengths ( @xmath91 standard deviation of the mean from field - to - field fluctuations ) are @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 mpc for equations  [ eq : nexpgiventheta ] ,  [ eq : nexpgiventhetaz ] , and  [ eq : expk ] , respectively , in good agreement with each other and with the estimate @xmath95 mpc from the angular - clustering analysis of adelberger et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the approaches of this section offer two additional benefits .",
    "first , the sum of one - dimensional integrals that they require is usually simpler to calculate numerically than the six - dimensional integral required by equation  [ eq : blain ] .",
    "second , as we have seen , the form of the equations makes it easy to omit pairs with undesirable angular separations from the analysis .",
    "unimpressed by the heuristic arguments of the previous section , i tested its recommendations on simulated galaxy surveys generated from the publicly released gif-@xmath96cdm simulation of structure formation in a cosmology with @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",

    "i concatenated numerous randomly selected volumes of size @xmath108 mpc@xmath109 into a long parallepiped with dimension @xmath110 mpc@xmath109 .",
    "after converting the comoving coordinates of each halo in the volume into redshift and angle ( for @xmath97 , @xmath98 , with @xmath111 mpc the redshift depth ) , i applied various selection effects to produce one mock pencil beam survey .",
    "numerous additional mock surveys , each generated in the same way , were used in the analysis .",
    "the mock surveys are clearly not exact reproductions of the actual universe .",
    "they are discontinuous every @xmath104 mpc , do not include any evolution in structure from the back to the front of the volume , and have an incorrect power - spectrum on very large ( @xmath112 mpc ) scales because they were extracted from a single @xmath104 mpc cube .",
    "however , the methods of   [ sec : alternatives ] work for objects with any spatial distribution , as long as the correlation function is sharply peaked , and the simulated surveys are similar enough to actual redshift surveys to provide a meaningful preview of how equations  [ eq : blain ] , [ eq : nexpgiventheta ] , [ eq : nexpgiventhetaz ] , and  [ eq : expk ] , will behave in realistic situations .",

    "the catalogs for the other panels were constructed in the same way , except as noted below .",
    "the middle left panel shows the effect of lowering @xmath118 from 200 to 20 .",
    "the noise in @xmath0 increases significantly with catalogs so small .",

    "although no approach performs particularly well , the method of equation  [ eq : expk ] is essentially unusable .",
    "this is because random fluctuations in pair counts often make @xmath120 , and the equivalent relationship for @xmath6 requires @xmath121 .",
    "( more formally , it is because equation  [ eq : kncondition ] is no longer a good approximation . )    for the bottom left panel , the simulated galaxies angular positions were concentrated towards the center of the field rather than being random : each galaxy s selection probability was multiplied by a gaussian with @xmath122 centered in the middle of the field , causing 90% of the galaxies in a typical catalog to fall within a region of diameter @xmath123 inside the larger @xmath113 field .",
    "this was intended to mimic the sort of selection effect than can appear in multislit spectroscopic surveys . in this case equation  [ eq : blain ]",
