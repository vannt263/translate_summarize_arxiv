    "in particular , we compared the scalar linear solvability of networks over different types of commutative rings of the same size .",
    "we proved that networks that are scalar linearly solvable over some commutative ring are also scalar linearly solvable over some field , although not necessarily of the same size .",
    "additionally , we characterized all commutative rings with the property that there exists a network with a scalar linear solution over the ring but not over any other commutative ring of the same size .",
    "linear network codes can be advantageous due to their ease of implementation and mathematical tractability .",
    "these properties are due to the algebraic simplicity of linear maps and also to the structured nature of the alphabets used .",
    "fields have the most algebraic constraints among alphabets used for linear network coding , e.g. associativity , distributivity , commutativity , invertibility .",
    "more generally , rings may lack commutativity and/or invertibility , thus providing a broader class of alphabets over which to achieve linear network solvability .",
    "we demonstrated in part i that relaxing only the invertibility constraint ( i.e. restricting to commutative rings ) can lead to linear network solvability that would not otherwise be possible with fields of the same alphabet size .    in the present paper ( part ii )",

    "it can easily be shown that any linear code over a right module is equivalent to a particular linear code over a left module , so we restrict attention only to left modules .      in section  [ sec : basicmodules ] , lemmas are given which are used in proofs later in the paper .",

    "we prove ( in theorem  [ thm : min_module_not_unique ] ) , in contrast to the commutative ring case , that the minimum size module with respect to linear solvability is not necessarily unique .",
    "thus , for a fixed network , vector linear codes over fields are `` best '' in a certain sense , as these codes can minimize the alphabet size needed for a linear solution .",
    "we also show ( in corollary  [ cor : general_vector ] ) that for all networks , the following properties are equivalent : ( i ) vector linear solvability over some field ,",
    "( ii ) scalar linear solvability over some ring , and ( iii ) linear solvability over some module .",
    "similarly , we show ( in corollary  [ cor : general_scalar ] ) that for all networks , the following properties are equivalent : ( a ) scalar linear solvability over some field , ( b ) scalar linear solvability over some commutative ring , and ( c ) linear solvability over some module whose ring is commutative . in section  [ sec : gen_m ] , we present a family of networks that generalize the m network of @xcite , and we enumerate ( in theorem  [ thm : dim - n_vector ] ) the particular vector dimensions over which each of these networks has vector linear solutions .",

    "the following lemma shows that the linear solvability of a network over a faithful @xmath7-module is determined entirely by the ring of scalars @xmath7 and not by the module s underlying abelian group .",

    "in contrast to lemma  [ lem : same_ring ] , if @xmath15 is both an @xmath7-module and an @xmath44-module , then there may exist a network that is linearly solvable over @xmath64 but not @xmath14 .",
