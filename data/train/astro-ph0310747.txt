    "magnetic acceleration and collimation has long been thought to be the underlying mechanism responsible for the similar manifestations of cosmic jets in such diverse systems as young stellar objects and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although some agn jets have long been known to exhibit apparent superluminal motions , with inferred ( terminal ) bulk lorentz factors in the blazar class of sources of @xmath0 ( but exceeding 40 in some cases ; e.g. , @xcite ) , most models to date have concentrated on the nonrelativistic regime .",
    "however , two recent discoveries  the detection of apparent superluminal motions in certain galactic black - hole binaries ( the so - called microquasars ; e.g. , @xcite ) , from which mildly relativistic bulk velocities have been deduced , and the inferred association of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with ultrarelativistic ( @xmath1 ) , highly collimated outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  have highlighted the strong similarities among the various types of relativistic jet sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and have refocused attention on the question of their origin .",
    "although the interpretation of relativistic outflows and the generalization of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) to the relativistic regime present several distinct challenges , the prevailing view has been that magnetic driving is the common underlying mechanism also in this case ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , this interpretation of relativistic jets is by no means universal .",
    "one example is provided by the radio galaxy ngc 6251 , in which @xcite inferred a bulk acceleration from @xmath2 to @xmath3 on sub - parsec scales .",
    "this behavior was attributed by @xcite to a thermal acceleration of a proton - electron plasma that is heated to a temperature @xmath4 in a region of radius @xmath5 .",
    "we note , however , that a thermally driven , purely hydrodynamic flow typically undergoes the bulk of its acceleration over a distance that is of the order of the size of the mass distribution that initially confines it by its gravity , which in this case is much smaller than the radius of the apparent acceleration zone ( see   [ thermalaccel ] ) .",
    "centrifugal driving ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  the commonly invoked hydromagnetic acceleration mechanism for nonrelativistic jets  typically also acts fairly rapidly and thus would similarly fail to account for the large - scale acceleration inferred in ngc 6251 .",
    "a possible resolution of this puzzle is provided by the finding of @xcite , who were the first to generalize the `` cold '' radially self - similar mhd flows of @xcite to the relativistic regime ( see also @xcite ) , that their solutions contain an extended magnetic pressure - gradient acceleration region beyond the classical fast - magnetosonic point ( a singular point of the bernoulli equation ) , a behavior that they ascribed to the action of a `` magnetic nozzle . ''",
    "it was subsequently shown by @xcite that a similar mechanism operates also in nonrelativistic flows , but the effect is probably easier to discern observationally in relativistic jets .",
    "vlahakis & knigl ( 2003a , hereafter vk ) carried out a further generalization by deriving `` hot , '' radially self - similar , relativistic mhd solutions for trans - alfvnic flows .",
    "they showed that the magnetic field always guides and collimates the flow , but that , if the specific enthalpy @xmath6 is initially ( subscript @xmath7 ) @xmath8 , then an extended _ thermal _ acceleration region can develop , within which the flow is accelerated from @xmath9 to @xmath10 . if the total energy - to - mass flux ratio @xmath11 is @xmath12 , corresponding to a poynting flux - dominated outflow , then the bulk of the acceleration is magnetic and takes place downstream from this point .",
    "vk demonstrated that the flow continues to be accelerated all the way up to the _ modified _ fast - magnetosonic surface , which is the locus of the fast - magnetosonic singular points of the _ combined _ bernoulli and transfield equations and represents the true `` causality surface '' ( or `` event horizon '' ) for the propagation of fast waves .",
    "vk showed that this singular surface can lie well beyond the classical fast - magnetosonic surface and argued that this is the essence of the `` magnetic nozzle '' effect .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers in which we apply the vk formalism to the interpretation of relativistic jets in agns .",
    "] our aim is to model a variety of observational findings and attempt to construct basic diagnostic tools for the study of such jets . in this paper",
    "we focus on the extended - acceleration signature of magnetically driven jets and use our solutions to model the parsec - scale accelerations already indicated in a number of relativistic jet sources",
    ". we first present arguments for why the extended acceleration is unlikely to have a thermal origin (   [ thermalaccel ] ) .",
    "we then consider magnetic jet models : after a brief review of the solution methodology (   [ model ] ) , we demonstrate (   [ magnetic ] ) that magnetic driving can account for sudou et al.s observations of ngc 6251 as well for the parsec - scale acceleration to @xmath13 inferred in superluminal blazar jets like 3c 345 @xcite . our conclusions are given in ",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the sub  parsec - scale kinematics of the ngc 6251 jet was deduced by @xcite after they discovered the counterjet in this powerful radio galaxy . by applying a relativistic beaming model to the measured variation in the jet  counterjet intensity ratio , they inferred that the outflow is accelerated from @xmath14 at @xmath15 to @xmath16 at @xmath17 ..",
    "since the differences from the values adopted by @xcite have little impact on our arguments , we continue to use the latter in our discussion .",
    "] we now argue that , contrary to the suggestion made in @xcite , the cause of this acceleration can not be thermal pressure driving .    since the inferred speeds are not too close to @xmath18 , it is sufficient to use nonrelativistic hydrodynamics . in the absence of magnetic forces and",
    "assuming spherical symmetry for simplicity , the flow can be described as a parker ( @xcite ) wind , in which the radial velocity @xmath19 is given as a function of the radius @xmath20 by @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the mass of the central black hole , @xmath23 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath24 is the sound speed of a fully ionized hydrogen gas ( with @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 being the adiabatic index , proton mass , and boltzmann s constant , respectively ) . in the best - fit model of @xcite (",
    "which is consistent with the limits set by the radio observations of @xcite ) , the base temperature ( at @xmath28 ) is @xmath29 . for these values of @xmath20 and @xmath30 , and with @xmath31 @xcite , we find that @xmath32 is @xmath33 and hence that the flow at @xmath34 would already be supersonic with @xmath35 . by the time such a flow reached the scales mapped by @xcite",
    ", its velocity would be significantly larger  and its acceleration substantially smaller  than what has been inferred from the observations .",
    "extended acceleration has also been indicated in superluminal blazar jets .",
    "for example , vlbi images of the quasar 3c 345 have shown that the jet component speeds increase with separation from the core ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in particular , in the case of the c7 component , @xcite combined a vlbi proper - motion measurement with an inference of the doppler factor from a synchrotron self - compton calculation to deduce an acceleration from @xmath36 to @xmath37 over a ( deprojected ) distance range ( measured from the core ) of @xmath38 .    although blazar jets are also sometimes modeled in terms of a purely hydrodynamic acceleration ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , one can show quite generally that in this case , too , thermal driving alone can not account for the observations .",
    "a variety of arguments ( summarized , e.g. , in @xcite ) indicate that protons are the dynamically dominant component in many agn jets .",
    "energy conservation in such outflows implies @xmath39 ( k_{\\rm b } t_i / m_p c^2)$ ] .",
    "even if the initial temperature were as high as @xmath40 , the terminal lorentz factor would still be @xmath41  much smaller than the values typically inferred from the observed superluminal motions .",
    "an additional argument can be made on the basis of the observed acceleration rate , which in a purely hydrodynamic model is determined by the radial dependence of the external pressure that provides lateral confinement of the jet . in a simplified picture of a one - dimensional pressure distribution that scales with distance @xmath42 from the origin as @xmath43 , the lorentz factor of an adiabatic , supersonic jet is predicted to increase as @xmath44 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "applying this picture to the 3c 345 data reported in @xcite , one infers @xmath45 on parsec scales .",
    "it is , however , unclear how a pressure distribution of this type could arise in a natural way in an agn .",
    "the most likely alternative in both of these cases is magnetic acceleration , which we consider in the remainder of this paper .",
    "vk considered the full set of special - relativistic mhd equations , allowing both the bulk and the random speeds to be relativistic .",
    "they assumed ideal mhd , axisymmetry , no explicit time dependence , and a polytropic equation of state ( with the pressure @xmath46 scaling with the rest - mass density @xmath47 as @xmath48 , where the adiabatic index is taken to be 5/3 or 4/3 depending , respectively , on whether the pressure is dominated by `` cold '' protons and electrons or by `` hot '' electron - positron pairs and radiation ) . under these assumptions",
    ", the mhd equations can be partially integrated to yield several field - line constants ( with the field line being identified by the poloidal magnetic flux function @xmath49 ) : the total specific angular momentum @xmath50 , the field angular velocity @xmath51 , the magnetization parameter @xmath52 ( with the mass - to - magnetic flux ratio given by @xmath53 ) , the adiabat @xmath54 , and the total energy - to - mass flux ratio @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 is the electric field amplitude , @xmath57 is the azimuthal field component , and @xmath58 is the poloidal velocity component ) .",

    "the transfield force - balance equation is integrated under the most general _ ansatz _ for radial self - similarity [ in spherical coordinates @xmath60 ) ] , in which the shape @xmath61 of a poloidal field line is given as a product of a function of @xmath49 times a function of @xmath62 : @xmath63 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "such a separation of variables can be effected if @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and if @xmath68 and @xmath69 . to obtain a solution ,",

    "a solution with @xmath76 should provide a good representation of the conditions near the axis of a highly collimated flow .",
    "conversely , a solution with @xmath78 corresponds to the return - current regime ( for which the poloidal current density is parallel to the field ) and may be most suitable at larger cylindrical distances .",
    "vk showed that , for @xmath79 , the modified fast surface is at infinity and an initially poynting - dominated flow ( @xmath80 ) attains a rough equipartition between the kinetic and poynting energy fluxes at large distances from the origin . in this case the lorentz force efficiently collimates the flow , which reaches cylindrical asymptotics .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath78 , even though the acceleration is more efficient ( so more of the poynting flux is converted into kinetic energy ) , the collimation is weaker and the flow only reaches conical asymptotics .",
    "the illustrative solutions derived in vk demonstrated that centrifugal driving plays a limited role in the acceleration of relativistic flows  it is only important initially ( for as long as @xmath81 ) . as already noted in   [ introduction ] , thermal acceleration can dominate over a more extended zone if the initial enthalpy is relativistic ( @xmath82 ) . magnetic acceleration , however , takes over after @xmath83 drops to @xmath84 and can remain important well beyond the classical fast - magnetosonic surface ( where @xmath85^{1/2}$ ] ) .",
    "if the poynting flux is initially smaller than the enthalpy flux ( corresponding to @xmath86 ) , the acceleration is predominantly thermal ( governed by @xmath87 ) and , for a trans - alfvnic solution , the magnetic field only acts to guide the flow .",
    "the collimation in this case is weak , and the streamlines are asymptotically conical ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a solution of the steady , axisymmetric , ideal - mhd equations that describes an outflow from a disk around a supermassive black hole . as in vk ,",
    "the solution was constructed using the @xmath20 self - similarity formalism but was restricted to extend over a finite radial range .",

    "figure [ fig1]a depicts the field - line shape .",
    "the innermost field line originates from the vicinity of the black hole , at a ( cylindrical ) distance @xmath98 of a few schwarzschild radii from the center ( for a black hole of mass @xmath22 , the schwarzschild radius is @xmath99 ) , whereas the outermost field line originates at @xmath100 . for this choice of the @xmath101 ratio and the inferred mass of the ngc 6251 black hole ,",
    "the mass - loss rate in the wind is @xmath102 ( see fig . [",

    "although the thermal pressure gradient is the dominant force density very close to the origin , the magnetic force rapidly takes over .",
    "( the centrifugal force , which could in principle also contribute near the origin , is much smaller than the pressure gradient force in this case . )",

    "the terminal lorentz factor , which again corresponds to a rough equipartition between the asymptotic poynting and kinetic energy fluxes @xmath133 is correspondingly higher .",
    "for the adopted fiducial parameters , the c7 component is predicted to continue accelerating up to @xmath134 .",
    "interestingly , lorentz factors of this order have been inferred in the more distant components ( in particular , c3 and c5 ) of the 3c 345 jet @xcite .    in comparison with the radio - galaxy solution of ",
    "[ ngc6251 ] , the quasar solution presented in this subsection corresponds to a more massive outflow ( with a mass - loss rate @xmath135 for @xmath136 ; see fig . [",
    "fig2]b ) and to a stronger magnetic field ( cf .",
    "[ fig1]g and [ fig2]g ) .",
    "we note , however , that the density and magnetic field strength are not uniquely determined from the kinematic data : exactly the same flow speeds and field - line shape are obtained if the density , particle pressure , and squared amplitudes of the magnetic field components are rescaled by the same factor .",
    "we have argued that acceleration of agn jets to relativistic velocities on scales that are much larger than the gravitational radius of the central black hole is most plausibly explained in terms of magnetic driving .",
    "this mechanism involves acceleration by the gradient of the azimuthal magnetic - field pressure and is distinct from centrifugal acceleration , which is often considered to be the dominant driving mechanism of nonrelativistic jets .",
    "centrifugal driving takes place in the sub - alfvnic flow regime and accelerates the gas to a poloidal speed that is of the order of the initial keplerian speed in the underlying disk . in comparison ,",
    "magnetic pressure - gradient acceleration occurs over a much more extended region ( up to the modified fast - magnetosonic surface ) and can produce a much higher ( relativistic ) terminal speed depending on the initial poynting - to - mass flux ratio @xmath11 . in the trans - alfvnic relativistic - mhd solutions presented in this paper ,",
    "the terminal lorentz factor is @xmath137 , corresponding to a rough equipartition between the asymptotic poynting and kinetic - energy fluxes .",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so most of the acceleration in these solutions occurs in the super - fast regime . ]",
    "these solutions are also characterized by strong magnetic collimation ( with the streamlines tending asymptotically to cylinders ) and are thus consistent with the narrow opening angles inferred in agn jets .",
    "thermal effects could in principle contribute to the acceleration even in jets where a large - scale magnetic field guides the flow .",
    "as discussed in vk , there are in general two thermal force densities : the pressure gradient @xmath138 and the `` temperature '' force@xmath139 .",
    "these forces accelerate the flow to @xmath10 . in cases where @xmath140 , the thermal acceleration takes place in the nonrelativistic regime and",
    "is terminated by the time the speed increases to @xmath141  i.e. , just beyond the sonic surface that typically lies very close to the origin . as pointed out in ",
    "[ thermalaccel ] , this situation applies to proton - electron outflows ; therefore , to the extent that agn jets have a dynamically dominant proton component ( as is often inferred to be the case ) , their acceleration to relativistic speeds will not be significantly influenced by thermal effects .. in this case the thermal driving ( dominated by the `` temperature '' force ) acts well beyond the sonic surface and accelerates the flow to a highly relativistic speed ( see   [ introduction ] ) .",
    "if , in addition to @xmath142 , @xmath143 also holds , then magnetic driving takes over at the end of the thermal acceleration zone and eventually increases the lorentz factor to @xmath144 ( see   [ model ] ) : this is the behavior obtained in the grb jet models referenced in footnote [ grbref ] . ]",
    "although we only considered two specific applications  sub  parsec - scale acceleration involving moderately relativistic speeds in a radio - galaxy jet ( ngc 6251 ;   [ ngc6251 ] ) and parsec - scale acceleration involving highly relativistic speeds in a superluminal radio quasar ( 3c 345 ;   [ 3c345 ] )  there are already several other reported cases of relativistic agn jets that show evidence for a parsec - scale acceleration . in some cases",
    "this has been deduced from an increase in the apparent speed of a particular superluminal component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in other cases , where there are observations of several superluminal components , it was found that the innermost one typically exhibits the smallest proper motion , with more distant components indicating an acceleration on parsec scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in the case of the quasar 3c 279 jet , @xcite inferred an acceleration from @xmath145 at @xmath146 to @xmath147 at @xmath148 using a similar approach to the one that had been employed by @xcite in 3c 345 .",
    "it is also worth noting in this connection that a variety of observations indirectly support the magnetic acceleration picture for agn jets .",
    "for example , the parsec - scale helical field morphology implied by our model is consistent with vlbi polarization maps of bl lac objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) and with circular - polarization measurements of blazars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , we defer a more detailed discussion of the additional observational implications of this model to future publications in this series .    in conclusion , we reemphasize that our modeling framework is quite general and is potentially applicable to relativistic jets in a variety of astrophysical settings . in our previous application",
    "to grbs , the model could account for the inferred values of @xmath149 and of the upper limit ( @xmath150 ) on the size of the acceleration region , but it could not be further constrained because the acceleration region in grb sources is not resolved .",
    "in contrast , the motion of the radio components in certain microquasar jets has been monitored on scales @xmath151 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it would thus be interesting to search for evidence of extended acceleration in these sources , in analogy with the situation in agn jets .",
