    "although many convincing epr ( einstein  podolsky  rosen ) experiments violating the local hidden variable models and various forms of bell inequalities were performed in the past thirty years , an experiment involving no supplementary assumptions  usually called a _ loophole ",
    "free experiment  is still waiting to be carried out . until recently loophole",
    " free experiments were not considered because they require very high detection efficiency  [ 4 ] and all experiments carried out till now have had an efficiency under 10%  @xmath0[10,15 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the most important supplementary assumption , the _ no enhancement assumption and the corresponding postselection method were considered to be very plausible .",
    "then santos devised  [ 2225 ] local hidden ",
    "variable models which violate not only the low detection loophole but also the _ no enhancement assumption as well as post  selection loophole , and these models , as well as considerable improvements in techniques , in particular , detector efficiencies , resulted in an interest into _ loophole  free experiments . in the past two years several sophisticated proposals appeared which rely on the recent improvement in the detection technology and meticulous elaborations of all experimental details .",
    "[ 6,11,12,14,18 ] the first three use maximal superpostions and require detection efficiency of at least 83%  @xmath0[7 ] and the other two use nonmaximal superpositions relying on recent results  [ 5,19,20 ] which require only 67%  detection efficiency for them .",
    "all proposals are very demanding and at the same time all but the last proposal invoke a postselection which is also a supplementary assumption .",
    "[ 25 ] in this paper we analyze several supplementary assumptions and propose a feasible method of doing a loophole ",
    "free bell experiment which requires only 67%  detection efficiency , can work with a realistic visibility , and uses a preselection method for preparing non  maximally entangled photon pairs .",
    "the preselection method is particularly attractive for its ability to employ solid angles of signal and idler photons ( in a downconversion process in a nonlinear crystal ) which differ up to five times from each other .",
    "this enables a tremendous increase in detection efficiency  from 10%  to over 80%as elaborated below .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction the recent revival of the bell issue has been partly triggered by new types of local hidden variables devised by santos  [ 22,25 ] which made all experiments carried out so far inconclusive .",
    "however , from the very first bell experiments it was clear that one day a conclusive loophole ",
    "free experiment must be carried out .  [ 3,4 ] at the time , such experiments were far from being feasible and as a consequence all experiments so far relied on coincidental detections and on an assumption that _ a subset of a total set of events would give the same statistics as the set itself .",
    "in other words no real experiment so far dealt with proper probabilities , i.e. , with _ ratios of detected events to copies of the physical system initially prepared .",
    "[ 12 ] let us see this point in some more details , first , for the clauser ",
    "horne  [ 3 ] form of the bell inequality , and then for hardy s equality .",
    "_    we consider a composite system containing two subsytems in a ( non)maximal superposition . when a property is being measured on subsystem @xmath1 by detector d@xmath2 , which has got an adjustable parameter @xmath3 corresponding to the property , the probability of an independent firing of one of the two detectors is @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) and of simultaneous triggering of both detectors is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of counts at d@xmath2",
    ", @xmath8 is the number of coincident counts , and @xmath9 is the total number of the systems the source emits .",
    "let a classical hidden state @xmath10 determine the individual counts and the probabilities of individual subsystems triggering the detectors : @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these probabilities are connected with the above introduced _",
    "long run probabilities by means of : @xmath13 ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the space of states @xmath10 and @xmath16 is the normalized probability density over states @xmath10 .",
    "the locality condition  which assumes that the probability of one of the detectors being triggered does not depend on whether the other one has been triggered or not  can be formalized as @xmath17 .",
    "horne s form of the bell inequality reads : @xmath18 where @xmath19 . _    the experiments carried out so far invoked the _ no  enhancement assumption @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 means that a filter for a property corresponding to parameters @xmath3 is switched off ) , wherewith eq .  ( [ eq : clauser ] ) after multiplication by @xmath16 and integration over @xmath10 yields @xmath22 thus  because of the low detection efficiency  all the experiments performed till now measured nothing but the above ratios .",
    "then santos devised  [ 22,23,25 ] hidden variables based on @xmath23 and left us only with the _ loophole  free option @xmath24 wherewith eq .",
    "( [ eq : clauser ] ) yields @xmath25 _ _    the above cited loophole ",
    "free proposals used the right inequality which requires 83%  detection efficiency for maximal superpositions and 67%  detection efficiency for nonmaximal ones .",
    "the left inequality always requires 83%  detection efficiency but it makes clear that if we want a _ loophole  free experiment we must always either register or preselect practically all the systems the source emits in order to obtain _ proper probabilities , i.e. , _ ratios of detected events to the number of emitted systems . an excellent test which immediately shows whether a particular experiment can be loophole ",
    "free is to see whether we can obtain @xmath26 , where ` @xmath27 ' means that a two  channel filter ( corresponding to a property @xmath28 and property non@xmath28 ) , e.g. , a birefringent prism , is used ; ` @xmath21 ' means that the filter has been taken out altogether . unfortunately all experiments carried out so far have @xmath29 .",
    "this applies to other approaches as well .",
    "e.g. , ardehali s additional assumptions  [ 1,2 ] are weaker than the _ no enhancement assumption but that does not help us in obtaining the proper probabilities .",
    "the latter is also true for the hardy s equality experiment recently carried out by torgerson , branning , monken , and mandel  [ 27 ] although they misleadingly claim that their `` method does not depend on the use of detectors with high or even known quantum efficiencies . ''",
    "[ 26 ] let us look at the experiment in some detail . _",
    "_ _ _    torgerson , branning , monken , and mandel argue , in effect , as follows . in a two  photon polarization coincidence experiment at an asymmetric beam splitter one can  assuming 100%  efficiency  pick up the orientation angles of the polarizers so as to have @xmath30 and @xmath31 , i.e. , polarization @xmath32 must occur together with @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "classically , if @xmath32 and @xmath34 sometimes occur together , then @xmath33 and @xmath35 should also sometimes occur together . in a quantum measurement",
    "though , for a particular reflectivity of the beam splitter one can ideally obtain @xmath36 together with @xmath37 which is a contradiction for a classical reasoning .",
    "when detection efficiency is far bellow 100%  one can assume that only coincidence data are relevant and substitute @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "if we define @xmath40 $ ] , where @xmath9 s are two  photon coincidence detections , for the considered experiment we arrive at 98%  efficiency .",
    "but , in doing so , we disregard first , that @xmath41 percent ( 44%  for the chosen @xmath42 ) of photons emerge from the same sides of the beam splitter , and secondly , that for the chosen source ( liio@xmath43 type ",
    "i downconverter ) one has @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "[ 16 ] thus , we end up not with @xmath45 but with @xmath46 . in other words ,",
    "the experiment is not a candidate for the loophole ",
    "free type of bell experiments although it is one of the most convincing coincidence counts experiments carried out so far .",
    "a schematic representation of the experiment is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "two independent type  ii crystals ( bbo ) act as two independent sources of two independent singlet pairs .",
    "two photons from each pair interfere at an asymmetrical beam splitter , bs and whenever they emerge from its opposite sides , pass through polarizers p1 and",
    "p2 , and fire the detectors d1 and d2 , they open the gate ( activate the pockels cells ) which preselects the other two photons into a nonmaximal singlet state . we achieve the high efficiency ( over 80% ) by choosing optimally narrow solid angles determined by the openings of d1 and d2 and five times wider solid angles determined by d1 and d2 .",
    "[ type  ii crystal , as a source of only one singlet pair  [ 8,15 ] , suffers from low efficiency ( at most 10%  @xmath0[15 ] ) due to necessarily symmetric detector solid angles . ]",
    "an ultrashort laser beam ( a subpicosecond one ) of frequency @xmath47 simultaneously ( split by a beam splitter ) pumps up two nonlinear crystals of type ",
    "ii producing in each of them intersecting cones of mutually perpendicularly polarized signal and idler photons of frequencies @xmath48 as shown in fig",
    ".  2 . the idler and signal photon pairs coming out from the crystals do not have definite phases and therefore can not exhibit second order interference .",
    "however they do appear entangled along the cone intersection lines because one can not know which cone which photon comes from .    by an appropriate preparation one can entangle them in a singlet  like state .  [ 15 ] their state",
    "is therefore @xmath49 the outgoing electric  field operators describing photons which pass through beam splitter bs and through polarizers p1 and p2 ( oriented at angles @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively ) and are detected by detectors d1 and d2 will thus read ( see fig .",
    "3 ) @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 are transmittances , @xmath55 , @xmath56 are reflectances , @xmath57 is time delay after which photon @xmath58 reaches bs , @xmath59 is time delay between bs and d1 , and @xmath60 is the frequency of photon @xmath58 .",
    "the annihilation operators act as follows : @xmath61 ,   @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 is defined analogously .",
    "operators describing photons which pass through polarizers p1 and p2 ( oriented at angles @xmath32 and @xmath34 , respectively ) , and through pockels cells and are detected by detectors d1 and d2 will thus read @xmath64 @xmath65 is defined analogously .",
    "the probability of detecting all four photons by detectors d1 , d2 , d1 , and d2 is thus @xmath66 where @xmath67 is detection efficiency ; @xmath68 and @xmath69 ; here @xmath70 ; @xmath71 ; here @xmath72 is the spacing of the interference fringes ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "@xmath73 can be changed by moving the detectors transversally to the incident beams .",
    "data for this expression are collected by detectors d1 and d2 whose openings are not points but have a certain width @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a realistic probability we integrate eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob-4 ] ) over @xmath75 and @xmath76 over @xmath74 to obtain @xmath77\\bigr ] dz_1dz_2\\nonumber\\\\ & = & { \\eta^2\\over4}(a^2+b^2-v2ab\\cos\\phi)\\,,\\label{eq : nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 ^ 2 $ ] is the _ visibility of the coincidence counting .",
    "we assume the near normal incidence at bs so as to have @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "next we assume a symmetric position of detectors d1 and d2 with respect to bs and the photons paths from the middle of the crystals so as to obtain @xmath81 .  [ 17,21 ] representing photons by a gaussian amplitude distribution of energies we have shown in ref .",
    "[ 21 ] that the visibility is reduced when the condition @xmath82 is not perfectly matched and when the coincidence detection time is not much smaller than the coherence time .",
    "we meet the latter demand by using a subpicosecond laser pump beam and the former by reducing the size of the detector ( d1 and d2 ) pinholes . by reducing the size of the detector pinholes",
    "we reduce the number of events detected by d1 and d2 but , on the other hand , this enables us to increase visibility of the bell pairs at d1 and d2 by sizing pinholes @xmath83 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) so as to make solid angles five times wider than the pinholes of d1 and d2. ( cf .",
    "joobeur , saleh , and teich .",
    "[ 13 ] ) alternatively , we can put @xmath48 filters ( @xmath47 is the frequency of the pumping beam ) in front of detectors d1 and d2 and drop the pinholes @xmath83 altogether . _",
    "let us now see in which way and when are all photons entangled . for @xmath84 and @xmath85 the probability eq .",
    "( [ eq : nu ] ) reads as @xmath86 and if we take away polarizers p1 and p2 the following maximal entanglement survives : @xmath87 . for an asymmetrical bs , however ,",
    "if we take away polarizers p1 and p2 , we obtain only partially entangled state @xmath88\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : par - ent } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , in order to obtain ( non)maximal entangled state for an asymmetrical beam splitter it is necessary to orient polarizers p1 and p2 so as to obtain a corresponding `` entangled '' probability given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob-4 ] ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , eq .  ( [ eq : prob-4 ] ) projects out the following ( non)maximal singlet  like probability : @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and where we multiplied eq .",
    "( [ eq : nu ] ) by 4 for other three possible coincidence detections [ ( @xmath95,@xmath96 ) , ( @xmath97,@xmath98 ) , and ( @xmath97,@xmath96 ) ] at bs and by @xmath99 for photons emerging from the same side of bs .",
    "the singles  probability of detecting a photon by d1 is @xmath100 analogously , the singles  probability of detecting a photon by d2 is @xmath101    introducing the above obtained probabilities into the clauser ",
    "horne inequality ( [ eq : enh ] ) we obtain the following minimal efficiency for its violation .",
    "@xmath102 this efficiency is a function of visibility @xmath103 and by looking at eqs .",
    "( [ eq : r - prob ] ) , ( [ eq : one ] ) , and ( [ eq : one ] ) we see that for each particular @xmath103 a different set of angles should minimize it .    a computer optimization of angles  presented in fig .",
    "4shows that the lower the reflectivity is , the lower is the minimal detection efficiency .",
    "also , we see a rather unexpected property that a low visibility does not have a significant impact on the violation of the bell inequality . for example , with 70%  visibility and 0.2 reflectivity of the beam splitter we obtain a violation with a lower detection efficiency than with 100%  visibility and 0.5 ( @xmath104 ) reflectivity .",
    "a similar calculation can be carried out for the hardy equalities given at the and of sec .",
    "it can be shown that the lowest possible @xmath42 , with only 510 standard deviations , should be taken and not the one which gives the greatest @xmath36 , again because the impact of a low visibility is the lowest when the beam splitter is the most asymmetrical .",
    "thus our preselection scheme can be used for a loophole ",
    "free `` hardy experiment '' as well .",
    "our elaboration shows that the recently found four  photon entanglement  [ 18,21 ] can be used for a realization of loophole ",
    "free _ bell experiments .",
    "we propose a set  up which uses two simultaneous type  ii downconversions into two singlet  like photon pairs . by combining two photons , one from each such singlet  like pair , at an asymmetrical beam splitter and detecting them in coincidence we preselect the other two completely independent photons into another singlet  like state ",
    "let us call them ",
    "_ bell pair. ( see figs .  1 and 3 . )",
    "our calculations show that no time or space windows are imposed on the _ bell pairs by the preselection procedure and this means that we can collect the photons within an optimal solid angle .",
    "if we take their solid angles five times wider than the angles of _ preselector photons ( determined by the openings of detectors d1 and d2see fig .  1 ) , then we can collect all _ bell pairs and at the same time keep a probability of the `` third party '' counts negligible . _",
    "_ _ _ _    for our set  up",
    "we can use the result presented in fig .  4 which enables a conclusive violation of bell s inequalities with a detection efficiency lower than 80%  even when the visibility is under 70%  at the same time .",
    "if we , however , agree that it is physically plausible to take into account only those _ bell pairs which are preselected by actually recorded detections at the beam splitter ( firing of d1 and d2 ) , then we can eliminate the low visibility impact altogether . in this case , we can set @xmath85 and for a _ different set of angles obtain a conclusive violation of bell s inequalities and hardy s equalities with still lower ( under 70% ) detection efficiency . _ _"
