    "the coulomb blockade effect in circuits with small - capacitance tunnel junctions provides the means of manipulating single charge quanta ( see , for example , the review paper by averin and likharev @xcite ) .",
    "if periodic signals of frequency @xmath2 are applied to the gate electrodes of the circuit , a train of single charges @xmath3 can move across an array of junctions so that charge pumping , giving rise to the current @xmath4 , is achieved .",
    "it was experimentally proven that the normal - state metallic circuits enable single electrons ( @xmath5 ) to be effectively pumped at frequencies @xmath2 of about several mhz @xcite . moreover",
    ", the accuracy of single - electron pumping can nowadays meet the requirements of fundamental metrology , @xmath6 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "unlike pumping of electrons , the pumping of cooper pairs ( @xmath8 ) in superconducting circuits has not been that successful so far .",
    "the only experiment had been carried out in 1991 by geerligs _",
    "@xcite with a three - junction al sample .",
    "although this experiment did evidence a pumping of the pairs , the pumping was strongly disturbed by several factors : the landau - zener transitions , cooper pair co - tunneling , quasiparticle tunneling , etc . as a result ,",
    "the shape of the current plateau at @xmath9 in the i - v curve was far from being perfect .",
    "recently , in their theoretical paper pekola _",
    "_ @xcite concluded that pumping of cooper pairs with reasonable accuracy in a three - junction array was impossible . for practical values of parameters ( the ratio of the josephson coupling energy to the charging energy @xmath10 ) they evaluated the inaccuracy of pumping @xmath11 to be as much as 9%-63% .",
    "this is because of intensive co - tunneling of pairs in the short arrays , i.e. the process of tunneling simultaneously across several ( @xmath12 ) junctions . to suppress the co - tunneling and , in doing so , to improve the characteristics of the pump they proposed to considerably increase the number of junctions @xmath13 ) and , hence , of the gates ( @xmath14 )",
    "however , such modification would make operation of the circuit more complex .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative way to improve cooper pair pumping in a three - junction array .",
    "we modify the bare circuit by attaching to the ends of the array the miniature resistors ( see the electric diagram of this device , which we call r - pump , in fig .  [ schema ] ) . their total resistance @xmath15 exceeds the resistance quantum @xmath16  k@xmath1 so that the dimensionless parameter @xmath17 the self - capacitance of these resistors should not be much larger than the junction capacitance @xmath18 .",
    "in this paper we will analyze how such resistors affect tunneling and co - tunneling of cooper pairs in the three - junction array and present preliminary experimental data .",
    "in general terms , the principle of operation of the r - pump remains the same as that of the pump without resistors ( for details of the cooper pair pump operation see ref .",
    "two periodic signals @xmath19 and @xmath20 are applied to the gates to form an elliptic trajectory in the parameter plane @xmath21 . at zero voltage @xmath22 across the pump",
    ", this trajectory encircles in the clockwise ( counter-    clockwise ) direction the triple point of the boundaries between the stability domains for adjacent charge configurations with an excess cooper pair . a complete cycle results in the charge @xmath8 @xmath23 being sequentially transferred across all three junctions of the array .",
    "the cooper pair transitions in a circuit without dissipation ( quasiparticle tunneling is neglected ) occur due to josephson tunneling ( supercurrent ) .",
    "the strength of the josephson coupling @xmath24 ( here @xmath25 is the critical current ) is assumed to be @xmath26 , the charging energy , i.e. parameter @xmath27 .",
    "when the domain boundary is crossed , the resonance condition is obeyed and josephson coupling mixes up the two states , each corresponding to the position of the pair on either side of the junction .",
    "( note that , at the same point , the resonance condition for co - tunneling in the opposite direction across two other junctions is met . )",
    "slow passage across the boundary results in transition of the pair in the desired direction .",
    "this process is mapped on the adiabatic level - crossing dynamics ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the probability of missing the transition is given by the landau - zener expression : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the velocity of variation of the energy difference @xmath30 between the two states .",
    "in contrast to the elastic ( and , hence , reversible ) tunneling of pairs in the pump without resistors , tunneling in the r - pump is accompanied by dissipation of energy .",
    "the strength of the dissipation effect depends on the active part re@xmath31 of an electromagnetic impedance seen by the tunneling pair , namely by the dimensionless parameter @xmath32 re@xmath33 .",
    "if the condition of weak josephson coupling @xmath34 is satisfied , i.e. @xmath35 , the rate of cooper pair tunneling is expressed as @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath30 is the energy gain associated with this transition and @xmath37 is the function describing the property of the environment to absorb the energy released in a tunneling event .",
    "( the discussion of properties as well as numerous examples of @xmath37 for different types of electromagnetic environment are given in the review paper by ingold and nazarov @xcite . ) the probability of a missed transition is then given by the expression : @xmath38 dt \\right\\ } = \\exp \\left(-{\\frac{\\pi e_j^2}{2\\hbar\\dot{e } } } \\right ) = p_{\\rm lz}.\\ ] ] here we used the normalization condition @xmath39 , and the assumption of a value @xmath40 constant in time was exploited .",
    "thus , in the case of weak coupling , dissipation does not affect the total probability of tunneling @xmath41 .",
    "this conclusion is in accordance with the general result obtained by ao and rammer @xcite for quantum dynamics of a two - level system in the presence of substantial dissipation .    using the expansion of @xmath42 in the region of small @xmath43 @xcite , @xcite one arrives at the expression @xmath44 for @xmath45 the rate @xmath46 is peaked at @xmath47 , while in the case ( @xmath48 ) the rate is zero at @xmath47 and the maximum",
    "is reached at finite energy @xmath49 , or , in other terms , at finite positive voltage @xmath22 across the junction .",
    "this property of @xmath50 in circuits with substantial dissipation plays the crucial role in the operation of the three - junction r - pump .    for one junction in the three - junction array with gate capacitances @xmath51 the effective impedance re@xmath52 , i.e. the parameter @xmath53 .",
    "the factor @xmath54 , which considerably attenuates the effect of resistors , stems from the square of the ratio of the total capacitance of the series array ( @xmath55 ) to the junction capacitance @xmath18 ( see a similar network analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , the equivalent damping for two junctions of the three - junction array is larger and determined by @xmath56 and , hence , @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the rate of cooper pair transition simultaneously across two junctions , i.e. the rate of the co - tunneling , at small @xmath30 is @xmath58 this expression has been obtained by considering the environmental effect in a similar fashion as was done by odintsov @xmath59 @xcite for the co - tunneling of normal electrons in a single - electron transistor .",
    "accordingly , co - tunneling across all three junctions decays even stronger ( @xmath60 ) , because the whole array experiences the full resistance @xmath15 .    the comparison of eq .",
    "( 6 ) with eq .",
    "( 5 ) taken for the value @xmath61 shows that the rate of co - tunneling is drastically depressed if @xmath62 is sufficiently large .",
    "for example , for @xmath63 ( or @xmath64  k@xmath1 ) the rate of cooper pair co - tunneling across two junctions @xmath65 ( i.e. it is similarly small as single - electron co - tunneling across a three - junction normal array @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the direct tunneling rate @xmath66 , is similar to that of ordinary electron tunneling .",
    "the effective junction resistance in the latter case is @xmath67 . for the practical value @xmath68 this",
    "formula yields @xmath69  k@xmath1 , i.e. the typical value of a normal single electron junction .",
    "since the junction resistance determines the characteristic time constant @xmath70 , it can be expected that the frequency characteristics of the cooper pair r - pump are at least not worse than those of the normal electron counterpart without resistors .",
    "the al / alo@xmath71/al tunnel junctions and cr resistors were fabricated @xmath72 by the three - angle shadow evaporation technique through a trilayer mask patterned by e - beam lithography and reactive - ion etching .",
    "the tunnel junction parameters of the best suited available sample were found to be : capacitance @xmath73  af and normal - state resistance @xmath74  k@xmath1 .",
    "the former value yields @xmath75ev . on the assumption that the ambegaokar - baratoff relation between the critical current @xmath25 and the junction resistance is valid , the aforementioned value of @xmath76 yields the value @xmath77ev , where @xmath78ev is the superconducting energy gap of aluminum at low temperature .",
    "these parameters of the sample give the ratio of characteristic energies @xmath79 .",
    "the thin - film cr resistors ( thickness @xmath80  nm ) had lateral dimensions of about 80  nm by 10  @xmath81 m .",
    "for the purpose of an independent characterization of the resistors and junctions , we attached four resistors in twos to either end of the junction array , resulting in the equivalent resistance @xmath82 on each side as depicted in fig .",
    "[ schema ] .",
    "( for the measurement of the i - v curves we used , however , the two - wire configuration . ) either of four resistors had @xmath83  k@xmath1 and reasonably low self - capacitance per unit length , @xmath84  af/@xmath81 m .",
    "the resistors exhibited negligibly small ( @xmath85  % ) non - linearity of the i - v curve in the region of small voltages at the millikelvin temperature @xcite .",
    "the samples were measured in the dilution refrigerator at the temperature @xmath86 of about 10  mk , i.e. well below the critical temperature of aluminum , @xmath87 1.15  k. the bias and gate lines were equipped with pieces of the thermocoax cable which was thermally anchored at the sample holder plate and served as a filter for frequencies above 1  ghz @xcite . the typical i - v curves with and without ac drive are presented in fig .",
    "[ ivc ] . the curves exhibit considerably smeared steps whose position ( @xmath88 ) clearly shows the linear current - versus - frequency dependence ( although the quality of the steps is noticeably degraded with increasing frequency )",
    "another feature of the steps is their position on the voltage axes : they appear at finite voltage @xmath22 applied in the current direction , while at @xmath89 neither co - tunneling nor pumping effect were observed .",
    "we attribute this effect to the damping effect of the resistors , which was too strong in this sample .",
    "thus , the behavior of the cooper pair r - pump differs significantly from that of the cooper pair pump without resistors @xcite .",
    "although our first experiment evidenced the desirable effect of cooper pair pumping , a further improvement is inevitably needed .",
    "first , the sample parameters should be optimized : josephson coupling should be increased ( possibly up to @xmath90 ) while the resistance value @xmath15 should be somewhat reduced .",
    "these parameter values lead to an increase of the tunneling rate and , as a consequence , to cooper pair pumping at zero voltage bias @xmath22 .",
    "secondly , the quasiparticle tunneling , resulting in sporadic translations of the cycle trajectory and , hence , to the pumping errors , should be reliably depressed : as the measurements showed , all our al - cr samples ( as well as those with @xmath91 ) so far suffered from quasiparticle tunneling @xcite and did not show the so - called parity effect @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is particularly remarkable that our cr resistors do not prevent an uncontrolled poisoning of josephson tunneling by non - equilibrium quasiparticles arriving at the islands from the external circuit .",
    "such `` buffer '' effect of the normal electrodes was proposed and demonstrated in al - cu devices by joyez @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "that is why the problem of the poisoning quasiparticle tunneling requires a more radical solution .",
    "probably manufacture of small - capacitance niobium junctions ( @xmath92  mev @xmath93 ) could improve the situation by making the parity effect in these structures stable .    in conclusion , we proposed a simple superconductor - normal metal circuit enabling , in principle , the efficient pumping of cooper pairs . due to the energy dissipation in the resistors , the effect of cooper pair co - tunneling",
