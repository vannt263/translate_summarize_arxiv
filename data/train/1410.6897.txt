    "until the end of 2007 , the  experiment recorded collisions at the 4s resonance with @xmath9 pairs produced , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath10 .",
    "seven years after the end of the data - taking period , is still producing many physics results . in the lhc era , is still competitive , especially for channels involving neutral particles such as or .",
    "we present here a selection of recent results on radiative decays from the experiment . in the standard model ( sm ) , both the and transitions are quark - level flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes .",
    "since all fcnc processes are forbidden at tree level in the sm , the lowest order diagrams representing these transitions must involve loops .",
    "in such processes , qcd corrections can typically be described using an effective hamiltonian defined as @xmath11 , where the @xmath12 and @xmath13 are , respectively , the short - distance wilson coefficients and local long - distance operators . contributions from new physics ( np ) in @xmath14 transitions may modify the sm values of the wilson coefficients , and change the values , predicted by the sm , of observables such as branching fractions and @xmath0 asymmetries .",
    "in this analysis  @xcite , the direct @xmath0 asymmetry , @xmath15 for the sum of exclusive final states is measured : @xmath16 the sm prediction for the asymmetry was found in a recent study to be in the range @xmath17  @xcite . from ref .",
    "@xcite , another test of the sm is proposed , via the measurement of the difference in @xmath15 in charged and neutral @xmath18 mesons : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the wilson coefficients corresponding to the electromagnetic dipole and the chromo - magnetic dipole transitions , respectively , and @xmath22 is the interference amplitude . since in the sm , both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are real , @xmath23 is expected to be zero .",
    "the @xmath18 meson decays are fully reconstructed in 16 self - tagging final states , which are listed in ref .",
    "the raw asymmetry is extracted from a simultaneous fit to the _ energy - substitued _ meson mass , @xmath24 , distributions of and tagged samples ; @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the momentum vector of the in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame and @xmath27 is the total energy of the system . the direct @xmath0 asymmetry is obtained after correcting the raw asymmetry for detector effects .",
    "possible dilutions from the presence of peaking backgrounds in the distributions are taken into account as systematic uncertainties .",
    "the measured value is @xmath28 , where the first quoted error is statistical and the second is systematic .",
    "this corresponds to the most precise measurement to date and is compatible with the sm .",
    "the measurement of @xmath23 is obtained by a simultaneous fit to the separate charge and neutral samples , such as @xmath29 , where the first quoted error is statistical and the second is systematic .    the interference amplitude , @xmath22 , in eq .",
    "[ eq : dacpim78 ] is only known as a range of possible values : @xmath30 . using the measured values of @xmath23 ,",
    "a @xmath31 minimization is performed for given @xmath32 from all possibles values of @xmath22 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : limits ] .",
    "the plateau of minimum @xmath33 corresponds to the region where a value of @xmath22 always exists in the allowed range such as the theoretical value of @xmath23 matches exactly the experimental one .",
    "the 68% and 90% confidence limits are then obtained from the ranges of @xmath32 , which yield the minimum @xmath31 less than 1 and 4 , respectively , such as : @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ fig : fitprojneutral ]",
    "the collaboration , seven years after the shutdown of the experiment , is still producing competitive results .",
    "three recent analyses have been presented , for which all the results are in agreement with the sm predictions ."
