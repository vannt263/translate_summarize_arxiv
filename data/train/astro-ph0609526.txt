    "we chose sources with rising ir spectrum ( 821 @xmath0 m ) , to include only sources with dominant ir continuum associated with blackbody temperatures @xmath36 k. we limited ourselves to longitudes @xmath37 to overlap with the glimpse i survey .",
    "we selected only sources that were isolated ( within @xmath38 ) in the msx maps to avoid confusion of the chop - nod procedure , used to subtract the background from the images .",

    "all of these 24 sources have msx - radio counterparts within @xmath40 and 16 of them have their counterparts within @xmath41 .",
    "we suspect that the non - detections result from the large difference in angular resolution between lws and msx ( @xmath42 ) , combined with the small ( @xmath22 ) field of view of lws .",
    "this either caused missing the source , or a false match between the ir source and a radio source , or if the match is real , the ir source may be a low surface brightness source , below the detection limit of lws .",
    "because the targets were invisible in the optical , we offset the telescope to the target fields from visible stars with known coordinates , resulting in pointing accuracy typically better than @xmath6 .",
    "this makes the non - detections less likely to be a result of the telescope",

    "a few preparatory steps are required in order to construct the temperature maps properly .",
    "first , all images were aligned relative to the 11.7 @xmath0 m images by employing a centroid - fitting algorithm to the peak or peaks .",
    "the images were then smoothed to the resolution of the image with the poorest resolution in each pair of flux density maps ( 17.65 @xmath0 m or 24.5 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the smoothing was done by convolving the images with the point - spread function ( psf ) of one of the reference stars in the corresponding band .",
    "for each of the two temperatures , we have also convolved the poorer resolution image with the psf of the better resolution band .",
    "for example , the 11.7 @xmath0 m image was convolved with the 17.65 @xmath0 m psf , and the 17.65 @xmath0 m image was convolved with the 11.7 @xmath0 m psf .",
    "this ensured that both images had the same effective resolution ( de buizer et al .",
    "a @xmath54 cut - off above the noise level was applied to all images , to ensure using only pixels with minimally good signal - to - noise .",
    "temperatures were then calculated only for diffraction limited spatial resolution elements which were above this cut - off at both bands .",
    "we have tested the robustness of our temperature maps by shifting one of the flux density maps of each temperature by @xmath55 pixels ( @xmath56 ) in ra and dec  an unlikely large uncertainty in the image alignment .",
    "the absolute values of the temperature maxima changed by as much as @xmath57 , but the main components remained unchanged in their shapes and relative positions .",
    "the average temperatures are much less sensitive to misalignments , and for the above shifts in the flux density maps , they typically vary by @xmath58 .",
    "this test also shows that aligning the images using the peak intensity does not bias the temperature and optical depth peaks .",
    "temperatures were computed pixel by pixel using a look - up table containing the calculated flux density ratios as a function of temperatures , assuming a modified blackbody with the dust emissivity law of draine ( 2003 ) for @xmath59,draine / dust / dustmix.html ] not including foreground extinction , and taking into account the filter transmission and the atmospheric transmission through the bandpass . according to the draine ( 2003 ) emissivity law ,",
    "the corresponding optical depths at the central wavelengths of our bands ( incorporating the filter bandpasses ) have the relations @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "the true power - law index is probably larger than 2 , since a few of the sizes are upper limits ( see  [ morph ] ) . when the upper limits are not included , it is @xmath356 .",
    "garay & lizano ( 1999 ) found a correlation between the radio luminosity and the radio size for a collection of samples comprising a few hundreds uc and compact h  ii regions .",
    "paladini , davies , & dezotti ( 2004 ) find a similar trend in a sample of 250 h  ii regions .",
    "the ionizing photon rate @xmath347 is proportional to the radio luminosity ( see eqs . [ tbright][lyc1 ] ) , but other variables , such as the temperature and the angular size , introduce an additional scatter in @xmath347 .",
    "another important implication of this result is that the more compact sources are actually due to later spectral types rather than young age .",
    "this was suggested using dynamic considerations by e.g. , de pree , rodrguez & goss ( 1995 ) , garca - segura & franco ( 1996 ) , xie et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and garay & lizano ( 1999 ) , and was known as the age problem of uc h  ii regions ( kim & koo 2001 ) : their number is about an order of magnitude greater than expected from other indicators of massive star - formation rate based on their dynamical age ( garay & lizano 1999 ) .",
    "if most of the uc h  ii regions are in fact b - stars and not o - stars , as suggested by the present work , the age problem might be resolved .",
    "this is why we might be missing the earliest o - stars : selecting the most compact radio sources ( 5 ghz diameters @xmath329 ) may have biased our sample towards later types .",
    "wood & churchwell ( 1989b ) suggested ir color criteria for selecting uc h  ii regions , based on iras data . the @xmath357 factor in angular resolution between iras and lws have an impact on these criteria , since in some cases , a significant fraction of the flux density comes from diffuse emission or sources unrelated to the compact object , that could not be separated with the iras beam .",
    "we compare the @xmath358 temperature derived from the @xmath359 ratio of iras ( wood & churchwell 1989b ) to that we obtain from lws ( @xmath360 ) , assuming a modified blackbody with the draine ( 2003 ) emissivity law as described in ",
    "these temperatures are shown in figure [ cdiag ] .",
    "we preferred to compare the temperatures and not the raw flux density ratios since they are easier to interpret .",
    "the lower limit on the temperature for uc h  ii regions ( 163 k ) is overplotted as a dashed line .",
    "this limit was derived from the limit on the @xmath359 ratio ( = 3.7 ) from wood & churchwell ( 1989b ) , taking into account the bandpass response of iras and the assumed emissivity law .",
    "there is a significant decrease in the limiting temperature between iras and lws to @xmath361125 k. this decrease may be explained in part by the steep slopes of modified blackbody spectra at 100 - 200 k , and the different band widths of iras and lws , making the flux density in the iras 12 @xmath0 m band ( 8.014.5 @xmath0 m band width ) be dominated by emission at 14.5 @xmath0 m  outside the lws 11.7 @xmath0 m band . however , simulating modified blackbody spectra at the temperature range 100 - 200 k show that for 2 out of the 10 sources with lws @xmath360 temperatures ( 11.94545@xmath430.03634 and 27.18725@xmath430.08095 ) , the bandpass difference alone can not explain the lower lws temperatures .",
    "we conclude that at least in these two cases , this decrease is a result of the improved angular resolution : the larger beam of iras averaged out many lines - of - sights with both low and high extinctions , but the higher resolution of lws means looking at the peak of the column density .",
    "extinction local to the uc h  ii region may be caused , for example , by a broad silicate absorption feature centered at 9.7 @xmath0 m , reaching into the 11.7 @xmath0 m bandpass .",
    "a larger extinction at 11.7 @xmath0 m compared to 24.5 @xmath0 m will make the h  ii region appear cooler in the higher resolution observations .",
    "the original location of the limiting line in figure [ cdiag ] could have let in contamination from other source populations , which can explain the broader latitude distribution found using the lower resolution iras catalog ( wood & churchwell 1989b ) compared to works incorporating the better resolution of the msx catalog ( giveon et al .",
    "such a change should be established using a larger sample of uc h  ii regions .",
    "a change in the wood & churchwell color criteria for selecting uc h  ii regions , will change their estimation of the formation rate of o stars in the galaxy , and may lead to alleviation of the age problem of uc h  ii regions (  [ correlate ] ) .",
    "we have presented high - resolution observations of a sub - sample of uc h  ii regions candidates drawn from the sample of giveon et al .",
    "( 2005a ) in the first galactic quadrant .",
    "we have presented sub - arcsecond resolution flux density maps , dust temperature and emission optical depth maps of these sources , and have studied the relations between their central stellar objects and the dust properties .",
    "the improved angular resolution of our observations ( @xmath42 compared to the msx ; @xmath362 compared to iras ) lead to better pinpointing of the uc h  ii regions within the mir sources , and thus , to better flux density and morphological determination .",
    "some of the sources are still compact , but the peaks of all sources are resolved .",
    "our main findings are :    * half of our objects are excited by b - stars and not by o - stars , and all our objects have derived types that are later than an o6 star , even for radio - derived luminosities and assuming far kinematic distances when ambiguous . only two sources ( 10% ) show a significant inconsistecy between the mir and radio - derived spectral type , which may be explained by the mir luminosities ( @xmath363 ) strongly underestimating the bolometric luminosities , or by foreground extinction of the mir wavelengths ( equivalent to @xmath330 ) . in general , approximating the bolometric luminosities using the longer wavelengths ( 17.65 and 24.5 @xmath0 m ) is better compared to the shorter wavelengths ( 11.7 and 17.65 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the average spectral type derived from @xmath363 is b0 ( @xmath333 , i.e. , in the range b1o9 )  the same as the radio - derived average spectral type .",
    "* the majority of our sources are optically thin at mir wavelengths , with a significantly optically thinner ( @xmath364 for all sources ) hot dust ( 150250 k ) , compared to an optically thicker ( @xmath365 for all sources and @xmath366 in two cases ) component of warm dust ( 60110 k ) .",
    "most of the optical photons are absorbed by the warm dust . *",
    "the 24.5 @xmath0 m flux densities of our sources are correlated with the 6 cm radio flux densities .",
    "this relation is fitted by @xmath345=(0.38\\pm 0.05)\\cdot f_{\\rm 5ghz}[{\\rm mjy } ] + ( 45\\pm 8)$ ] .",
    "the correlations of the 11.7 and 17.65 @xmath0 m bands are weaker , further supporting our result that the 24.5 @xmath0 m flux density is a better estimator of the total flux density reprocessed by the dust . *",
    "the mir sizes are correlated with the source ionizing photon rates , confirming the picture of dust cocoons enveloping strmgren spheres of ionized gas .",
    "we find the relation @xmath355=(1.98\\pm 0.09)\\log d_{11.7}\\ [ pc]-(50.1\\pm 0.1)$ ] .",
    "this correlation suggests that the more compact sources are actually due to later spectral types rather than young age , which may lead to alleviation of the age problem of uc h  ii regions .",
    "a possible explanation for missing the earliest o - stars might be a bias imposed by selecting the most compact radio sources ( 5 ghz diameters @xmath329 ) .",
    "* the new flux density estimations lead on average to redder mir colors or cooler temperature for our sources compared to iras observations . for at least two of our sources ,",
    "the reddening effect is too big to be exclusively explained by the different bandpass response of iras and lws .",
    "we conclude that in these cases the significantly smaller beam of lws focuses on larger dust columns towards the more accurate positions of the uc h  ii regions , while the larger beam of iras averaged out many lines - of - sight .",
    "our sources are thus shifted to redder colors in the wood & churchwell ( 1989b ) color diagram that is used for selecting uc h  ii regions based on their mir colors .",
    "this may account for some contaminations in selecting uc h  ii regions using the iras criteria , and may lead to a change in the estimated star - formation when larger samples are observed at sub - arcsecond resolution . *",
    "the mir maps show a good overall match in shape when compared to existing radio images with comparable resolution .",
    "the significant improvement in angular resolution and the ability to pinpoint the uc h  ii regions lead us to conclude that such an analysis applied to a larger sample would improve our understanding of star - formation in the milky way : what are the effects of including a possible large population of b - stars , and the reddening effect we discovered on color - selection criteria of uc h  ii regions in both the galactic and extragalactic objects ? our observations had a 25% rate of non - detections with lws of sources with high mir - radio matching probabilities based on the msx and the vla data .",
    "we suspect the reason is the large difference in angular resolution between lws and msx , combined with the small field of view of lws .",
    "this either caused a false match between the ir source and a radio source , or even if the match is real , the ir source might be a low surface brightness source , below the detection limit of lws .",
    "the glimpse survey is most suitable for confirming the mir - radio associations of sources in our original sample ( giveon et al .",
    "2005a ) , since it has higher resolution than the msx .",
    "however , it is limited in wavelength . additional observations which will compensate for that deficiency are thus needed .",
