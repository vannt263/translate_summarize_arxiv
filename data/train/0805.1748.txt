    "for example , if @xmath47 , then @xmath48 , matching the result for an oscillating real field .    ref .",
    "@xcite showed ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) that this coherently spinning field remains stable ( neglecting gravity ) to small perturbations if @xmath49 and unstable , at sufficiently long wavelengths , if @xmath50 .",
    "this result can be understood simply .",
    "the dynamics of perturbations in the linear regime are identical to the evolution of two particles undergoing circular orbits in a two - dimensional circularly symmetric potential @xmath51 ; the gradient - energy density in the scalar field acts as a spring of force constant @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 is the fourier wavenumber of the perturbation ) connecting the two particles .",
    "the radii of the two orbits differ initially by only a tiny amount . in the absence of any coupling between the two particles",

    "if , however , the particle at larger @xmath54 runs behind , as it will for @xmath49 , then it pulls on the inner particle , taking angular momentum from it",
    ". the inner particle must then evolve to a smaller-@xmath54 orbit and the outer particle to a larger-@xmath54 orbit . in this way",

    "@xcite ) .    for @xmath47 , the instability sets in for @xmath5 .",
    "it is thus concluded that power - law spintessence potentials with negative pressure are subject to this instability and are therefore unsuitable as dark - energy candidates .",
    "a similar argument can be applied to the growth of perturbations in oscillating - field matter . adding a perturbation @xmath56 to the homogeneous solution for the scalar field , the linear equation of motion for the perturbation obtained from eq .",

    "particle 1 is released at rest from some initial height @xmath63 ( where we will later identify @xmath12 as the amplitude of the background oscillations ) , and particle 2 is released slightly higher at @xmath64 . because the frequency of oscillation will in general be amplitude dependent , if there is no spring connecting the two masses , then each oscillates at its own frequency . if @xmath65 , then the higher - amplitude mass ( particle 2 ) runs ahead of the lower - amplitude mass ( particle 1 ) , and _ vice versa _ if @xmath66 .",
    "if the spring connecting the two masses is extremely strong , then the two masses oscillate together .",
    "however , if the spring is weak , then energy can be exchanged between the two particles .",
    "if @xmath65 , then particle 2 runs ahead , pulls on particle 1 , and consequently donates some of its energy .",
    "particle 1 then moves to a higher - amplitude orbit , particle 2 to a lower one , and the separation between them diminishes .",
    "such perturbations are stable .",

    "we will now calculate the analogous small - scale cutoff if axions make up the dark matter .",
    "cosmological axions in the @xmath208  ev mass regime are produced by the misalignment mechanism near the time of the qcd phase transition , and they may thus be described by a coherently oscillating scalar field .",

    "if axions make up the dark matter , then the axion energy density today is @xmath215 , where @xmath216 is the cold - dark - matter density and @xmath217 is the critical density , and this relation can be used to fix @xmath12 . using the scaling @xmath218",
    ", we find also that @xmath219 not only today , but at all redshifts @xmath220 during matter domination .",
    "the axion - axion interactions implied by the @xmath221 correction to the quadratic potential therefore have little effect on the jeans scale , which is well approximated by the earlier result of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the physical jeans scale is given by @xmath222 , and the jeans mass then turns out to be @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is the current matter density .",
    "numerically , @xmath225 the collapse redshift for such low - mass halos depends on the primordial spectral index , but is generally in the range @xmath226 , resulting in a small - scale cutoff of order @xmath227 in the primordial power spectrum , much smaller than that for wimps .",

    "we have considered the dynamical and gravitational amplification of inhomogeneities in oscillating - field matter .",
    "we provided a simple physical picture for the origin of instabilities in oscillating - field matter and in spintessence . in this picture , the condition for instability is seen as a condition on the amplitude dependence of the frequency , a condition that can be shown to be equivalent to positivity of the sound speed .",
    "this argument was verified analytically for nearly harmonic potentials and numerically for more general potentials .",
    "we then included gravity in the analysis , generalizing earlier results on the gravitational instability of harmonic potentials to potentials that differ slightly from harmonic .",
    "we used this result to evaluate the small - scale cutoff in the matter power spectrum if axions make up the dark matter .",
    "we leave the implications of this cutoff ( roughly @xmath0 ) to future work .",
    "our results indicate that potentials that give rise to accelerated expansion generically suffer dynamical instabilities to the growth of large - scale inhomogeneities .",
    "these instabilities should render oscillating fields unsuitable to account for dark energy in the universe today or for driving inflation in the early universe , as both scenarios require the cosmological density to remain homogeneous for extended periods of time .",
    "it is true that there may be potentials that drive acceleration and are stable , but stability and/or acceleration will be only temporary .",
    "this loophole is thus unlikely to alter our conclusions .",
    "we were able to make progress analytically for both the dynamical and gravitational instability only for nearly harmonic potentials",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether analytic results for the growth of perturbations can be extended to more general potentials .",
    "we leave the investigation of this question for future work .",
