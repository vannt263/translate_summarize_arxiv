    "in our previous paper @xcite we proposed to use an invariant link formulation to investigate some properties of two dimensional ( @xmath1 ) models in the low temperature limit .",
    "we have argued that this approach is more reliable for calculation of asymptotic expansions of invariant functions in cases when the mermin - wagner theorem forbids spontaneous symmetry breaking in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have calculated the first order coefficient of the free energy of @xmath2 model which turned out to coincide with the conventional answer .",
    "the starting point of calculations is the following partition function of @xmath1 @xmath0 model @xmath3 \\ , \\label{lpf}\\ ] ] where the jacobian @xmath4 is a product of @xmath0 delta - functions taken over all plaquettes of @xmath1 lattice @xmath5 \\ . \\label{jacob}\\ ] ] the sum over @xmath6 is sum over all representations of @xmath0 , @xmath7 is the dimension of @xmath6-th representation . the @xmath0 character @xmath8 depends on a product of the link matrices @xmath9 along a closed path independent loops . ] : @xmath10 one of the main technical observations made in @xcite is that at large @xmath11 the @xmath0 delta - function can actually be replaced by the dirac delta - function so that partition function becomes @xmath12   \\prod_{p , k}\\delta ( \\omega_p^k ) \\ , \\label{lpfd}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is a plaquette angle @xmath14 such a naive replacement is of course plagued by the problem of @xmath15 zero modes for auxiliary fields therefore the delta - function in ( [ lpfd ] ) should be correspondingly regularized .",
    "this can be done , for instance , by introducing the heat - kernel into the expression for the partition function instead of the @xmath0 delta - function .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to introducing a mass term for auxiliary fields .",
    "direct calculations show however that zero modes decouple from the large-@xmath11 expansion in the @xmath2 model @xcite ( we could not generalize that consideration for arbitrary @xmath0 , though ) . in what follows we work with massless green functions omitting zero modes from all lattice sums similarly to @xmath2 case .",
    "all general expressions remain valid if one works with mass regulator term as mentioned above .",
    "since all logarithmic divergences cancel we expect that the convergence to the thermodynamic limit ( tl ) is uniform : in all cases the final result can be expressed in terms of link functions @xmath16 , @xmath17 introduced in @xcite and standard @xmath18-functions . for @xmath0 model the expansion itself",
    "is done precisely like in @xcite for @xmath2 .",
    "we obtain for the first order coefficient of the free energy @xmath19 this result agrees with the result of the conventional pt @xcite .",
    "an essential motivation of our investigations is to study the problem of the uniformity of the low - temperature expansion in @xmath1 models , the question addressed in @xcite . before direct attack of this problem",
    "we have decided we need to make our approach more suitable for practical computations . also , it is necessary to establish some general properties of the expansion , for example the path independence of the correlation functions and the infrared finitness of the expansion .",
    "we address these and some other problems in the present article .",
    "we give a general expression for the second order coefficient of fixed distance correlation function in terms of green functions and calculate this coefficient for distance 1 .",
    "our final result agrees with eq.([c1fe ] ) .",
    "let us consider two - point correlation function @xmath20 where @xmath21 if along the path @xmath22 the link @xmath23 goes in the positive direction and @xmath24 , otherwise .",
    "obviously , it does not depend on a shape of the path @xmath22 and any expansion in the link formulation must respect this property . in large-@xmath11 expansion every coefficient at a given order should be path independent .",
    "this requirement generates certain relations on link green functions thus allowing for a deformation of any given path to any other one .",
    "since this independence is guaranteed only by the jacobian @xmath4 , the check on such independence would be highly desirable since it can show whether we treat the jacobian correctly and whether all contributions are taken into account .",
    "further , we re - analyze the free energy of @xmath25 models .",
    "as is well known , large-@xmath11 expansion in @xmath25 non - abelain models is non - uniform in the volume , therefore our expansion has to explain this feature .    as for now",
    ", all our results agree completely with the standard approach to the low - temperature expansion in @xmath1 models .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the expansion in the link formulation also suffers from ambiguities previously found in the standard expansion @xcite .",

    "we mention this example in the discussion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",

    "the general expansion of the second order coefficient of the correlation function in @xmath0 model is given in terms of green functions .",
    "in this paper we compute this coefficient for distance 1 .",
    "a proof of the path independence of the first and second order coefficients of the correlation function is given in section 4 . also , we prove here the infrared finitness of the second order coefficient .",
    "section 5 is devoted to one dimensional models .",
    "we analyze the low - temperature expansion of the free energy and explain why this expansion is non - uniform in the volume . in section 6 we study contribution of the holonomy operators to the low - temperature expansion in @xmath1 models and compare it with one dimensional case .",

    "let us consider a path consisting of links which point only in a positive direction ( see fig.1 for our notation of links on a dual lattice ) .",

    "we give general expression for the second - order coefficient of the fixed - distance correlation function in terms of green functions .",

    "we want to prove now that our representation for the correlation function is path independent . in the strong coupling region",
    "such an independence is a simple consequence of the compact invariant integration which is lost in the large-@xmath11 expansion . since , however any coefficient at a given order of the large-@xmath11 expansion has to be path independent the direct proof of this property serves as an additional check of the correctness of the expansion .",
    "the path independence is guaranteed by the jacobian which introduces the constraint on the plaquette matrix @xmath110 .",
    "just this constraint imposes independence of the correlation function of the path and this constraint must be checked at each order of the large-@xmath11 expansion . to show that this constraint is fulfilled we write down @xmath111 the path independence requires @xmath112 first",

    "eq.([dleq ] ) gives @xmath134 performing all summations we finally get @xmath135 one sees that this connected piece cancels exactly contribution of the second order term from the expansion of the correlation function .",

    "the generalization of this proof to the product of link matrices along an arbitrary closed path is straightforward .      in this subsection",
    "we prove the infrared finitness of @xmath137 .",
    "the only term which includes @xmath33 and hence could logarithmically diverge is @xmath138 and @xmath139 is given in eq.([i1 ] ) .",
    "we want to show that @xmath33 in the last expression can actually be replaced by @xmath140 because all additive constants like logarithmic term in @xmath33 do not contribute to the sums in eq.([q33div ] ) .",

    "to analyze @xmath25 @xmath0 model we note that the formula for @xmath137 given in section 3.2 remains valid if we take for the link green function the following expression @xmath147 this equation is a trivial consequence of the fact that in the link formulation the @xmath25 model reduces to one link integrals .",
    "then , it is straightforward to calculate , for example , the first order coefficient of the free energy .",
    "we find @xmath148 which agrees with the expansion of the exact result in the tl . on the other hand",

    "we think it is because the result of @xcite was obtained using the mass regulator term , i.e. the procedure which is known to give wrong answer even in a finite volume @xcite . to check the correctness of ( [ c11d ] ) we have compared it for @xmath154 with @xmath155 model @xmath156 where the second term comes from the hasenfratz term which survives the tl in @xmath25 .",

    "on @xmath1 lattice one should restrict two holonomy operators . in our previous analysis",
    "we have neglected this restriction . since , however this global constraint influences the tl in @xmath25 if the low - temperature expansion is done in a finite volume we think it is instructive to see what happens with holonomies in two - dimensional models .",

    "this is a reason why it survives the tl in @xmath25 .",
    "correspondingly , in @xmath1 it vanishes like @xmath165 .",
    "the second type is related to the modification of the generating functional .",
    "namely , one should make the following replacement of the green functions @xmath166",
    "@xmath167 @xmath168 in particular , the corresponding replacements should be made in formulae ( [ suncorf])-([i2 ] ) .",
    "let us take for simplicity such paths @xmath169 which consist of links pointing only in one direction .",
    "the coordinates of the corresponding links on the dual lattice are @xmath170 \\ , \\ b\\in h_1\\ ] ] and @xmath171 \\ , \\ b\\in h_2 \\ .\\ ] ] it is easy to find @xmath172 @xmath173 in general we get for @xmath30 , @xmath174 @xmath175 on the other hand , one finds in the tl @xmath176 which leads to @xmath177 we thus have for new functions @xmath178 @xmath179 @xmath180 one sees that the only new term which could potentially survive the tl is the second term in the last expression .",
    "this term is to be substituted into ( [ q33 ] ) and it leads to the computation of sums of the form @xmath181 the first term vanishes like @xmath165 because of 2 extra deltas .",
    "the second and constant terms equal zero because of ( [ canc ] ) .",
    "moreover , in general it is clear from ( [ gllhres])-([gxxhres ] ) that the holonomies may only contribute to the tl through the constant term in @xmath182 .",
    "this is , however equivalent to non - cancelation of infrared divergences in some higher orders . in all other cases the holonomies",
    "do not survive the tl .",
    "in this paper we used the link representation to develop the low - temperature expansion of some @xmath1 models .",
    "our main concern here was the investigation of a fixed distance correlation function in models with non - abelian @xmath0 global symmetry .",
    "we have calculated the first and second order coefficients of large-@xmath11 expansion of such correlation in terms of green functions and have shown that they coincide with the conventional expansion , at least for the shortest distance .",
    "we have demonstrated how the path independence of the correlation function manifests itself in our expansion and have proven such independence for the first two coefficients via direct calculations .",
    "we have also shown which properties of the expansion guarantee its infrared finitness , at least in lowest orders . moreover , since in our expansion the source of such divergences is exactly localized ( they can only emerge from the expectation values of auxiliary fields which appear in even general power ) we think it should be possible to generalize the proof given in section 4.1 for higher orders .",
    "it could lead to a lattice analog of david s theorem @xcite which states the infrared finitness of the weak coupling expansion of continuum models .",
    "further , we have re - analyzed the low - temperature expansion of @xmath25 models in the link representation . in this representation",
    "one should impose a global constraint on link matrices ( [ jacob1d ] ) .",
    "this global constraint vanishes in the tl if this limit is taken before low - temperature expansion .",
    "however , if expansion is done in a finite volume , the expansion of the holonomy operator , which imposes the global constraint does survive the tl .",
    "it leads to the non - uniformity of the low - temperature expansion in one dimension .",
    "we also have proven that it is not the case in @xmath1 : at least in the lowest orders the holonomies do not survive the tl and there is a good reason to believe that they do not in higher orders as well .",
    "we thus find that the low - temperature expansion performed in the link representation coincides with the conventional pt , at least in the lowest orders .",
    "in fact , it seems that these two expansions have to coincide up to arbitrary order .",
    "if the conventional pt produces the correct asymptotic expansion in a finite volume , any other expansion is bound to reproduce the same coefficients when the volume is fixed . moreover",
    ", this also refers to the tl if these coefficients are infrared finite .",
    "originally ( following arguments given in @xcite ) we thought that the expansion around @xmath183 has somehow better theoretical status .",
    "in particular , if the expansion around @xmath184 fails in the tl as the expansion around the non - existing in the tl saddle point , there seems to be a little doubt that the point @xmath183 is the only saddle point in the tl similarly to the abelian case .",
    "it led us to a conclusion that the expansion in the link representation could be free of ambiguities found in @xcite ( see also discussion in @xcite-@xcite ) and which put under doubts that the conventional pt gives an asymptotic uniform in the volume for non - abelian models .",
    "unfortunately , this our conclusion was wrong as the next example shows .",
    "we consider this example as an superinstanton example @xcite adjusted for the periodic lattice in the link formulation .",
    "since the calculations are very lengthy we only sketch the arguments leaving details for a future @xcite .",
    "let us consider the system on the periodic lattice given by the partition function ( [ lpf ] ) with the only difference : we leave one plaquette , say @xmath185 , unrestricted , i.e. on the dual lattice we have ( @xmath186 ) @xmath187 \\ . \\label{jacobunr}\\ ] ] it has to be clear that this modification should leave no memory in the tl .",
    "for example , it is the case in the high - temperature expansion ( truly , we checked only the lowest order ) .",
    "we are going to argue that while the coefficients of the low - temperature expansion of the @xmath27 model are indeed unchanged in the tl , it is not so for non - abelian models and the trouble starts from @xmath26 , precisely like in the superinstanton example .",
    "the expansion is done precisely like with the standard partition function , the only modification concerns the generating functional .",
    "it can be shown that one has to use the following green functions @xmath188",
    "@xmath189 @xmath190 as the simplest examples , we give the expression for the average plaquette in the @xmath27 model up to the first order @xmath191 and the expression for an average link of the unrestricted plaquette up to the second order @xmath192 one sees that even links of unrestricted plaquette converge to the true tl , though the convergence is slow , like @xmath193 ( similarly to the pt with superinstanton bc ) .",
    "the first order coefficient of the correlation function of the @xmath0 model also converges logarithmically to the tl value ( [ sunc1 ] ) .",
    "however , it is not the case for the second order coefficient .",
    "this can be most easily seen , e.g. from the expression for the function @xmath194 in eq.([dlun ] ) . in the case",
    "when all sums converge to the tl uniformly , one gets in the tl the following expression @xmath195 which shows that there appear new contributions which do not vanish in the tl .",
    "we have not finished calculations of all these contributions for links of restricted plaquette but it seems for us that even in this case one should expect a modification of the standard tl .",
