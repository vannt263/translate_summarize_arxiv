    "this paper is concerned with ( i ) the kinetics of thermal degradation of a hybrid nanocomposite with isotactic polypropylene ( ipp ) matrix reinforced with montmorillonite ( mmt ) clay and ( ii ) the effect of degradation on the viscoelastic response of the nanocomposite in the melt state .",
    "the choice of ipp for the experimental analysis is explained by numerous industrial applications of this semicrystalline polymer ( oriented films for packaging , reinforcing fibres , non - woven fabrics , pipes , etc . ) .",
    "montmorillonite is an inorganic clay conventionally used for preparation of hybrid nanocomposites .",
    "it possesses a layered structure constructed of two tetrahedral sheets of silica surrounding an octahedral sheet of alumina or magnesia .",
    "the layers ( with a thickness of 1 nm ) are stacked by weak dipole forces , while the galleries between the layers are occupied by metal cations .",
    "the focus on the influence of thermal degradation of a polymer  clay nanocomposite on its time - dependent response may be explained by two reasons : ( i ) from the standpoint of applications , the effect of degradation on the viscoelastic behavior is of essential importance for the prediction of mechanical properties of reprocessed industrial and post - consumer plastic wastes @xcite ; ( ii ) from the point of view of fundamental research , thermal degradation of a polymer is tantamount to a reduction in its molecular weight @xcite , which implies that the analysis of the time - dependent response of nanocomposite melts annealed at various temperatures @xmath3 for various amounts of time @xmath4 sheds some light on their structure  property relations ( correlations between the molecular weight of the matrix and the material parameters describing the mechanical response ) .",
    "the kinetics of thermal and thermo - oxidative degradation of polypropylene has attracted substantial attention in the past decade , see @xcite , to mention a few .",
    "annealing , thermal degradation and stability of nanocomposites with a polypropylene matrix and mmt filler were recently studied in @xcite .",
    "some relations between the viscoelastic response of ipp  mmt nanocomposites and their structure have been established in @xcite .    despite substantial progress in our understanding of the degradation process and its effect on the mechanical response of hybrid nanocomposites , it is difficult , however , to mention a constitutive model that adequately predicts the time - dependent behavior of ipp  mmt nanocomposite annealed for a given time @xmath4 at a required temperature @xmath3 above the melting temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the objective of this study is three - fold :    1 .   to report experimental data in isothermal torsional oscillation tests with small strains ( at the temperature @xmath0  @xmath1c , which is a typical temperature for injection - molding of ipp ) on specimens annealed for various amounts of time @xmath4 ( ranging from 15 to 420 min ) at various temperatures @xmath3 ( in the interval from 250 to 310  @xmath1c ) .",
    "2 .   to develop kinetic equations for the evolution of number - average and mass - average molecular weights at thermal degradation and to find adjustable parameters in these relations by fitting the experimental data .",
    "3 .   to derive constitutive equations for the viscoelastic behavior of a nanocomposite melt , to determine material constants in the stress  strain relations by matching the dependencies of the storage and loss moduli on frequency , and to evaluate the effect of thermal degradation on the time - dependent response .    to make the model tractable from the mathematical standpoint , we adopt the homogenization hypothesis . according to it , a complicated micro - structure of a nanocomposite",
    "may be replaced by an equivalent phase , whose response captures essential features of the mechanical behavior of the nanocomposite . as the equivalent phase",
    ", a network of macromolecules is chosen in the present study .",
    "following @xcite , degradation of the host matrix in an hybrid nanocomposite is treated as a combination of two thermally - activated processes : ( i ) binary scission of chains , and ( ii ) annihilation of end- and side - groups ( diffusion of small - size fragmentation products and their subsequent evaporation through the surface of a specimen ) . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we accept the conventional assumptions that ( i ) the probability of a scission event is independent of a chain s length and the position of a bond along the backbone of a chain ; ( ii ) the diffusivity of separated end- and side - groups is so large at the exposure temperature @xmath3 that the kinetics of diffusion of oligomers and their evaporation may be disregarded . as a result , the number of material constants in the kinetic equation is reduced to two .",
    "these quantities are found by matching a master - curve for the decrease in the mass - average molecular weight with exposure time @xmath4 .",
    "to develop constitutive equations for a nanocomposite melt , we accept the concept of transient networks @xcite .",
    "the melt is treated as a network of strands bridged by temporary junctions ( entanglements and physical cross - links on the surfaces of clay platelets ) . at random times ,",
    "active strands separate from their junctions being excited by thermal fluctuations , and dangling strands merge with the network .",
    "following @xcite , we assume the network to be strongly heterogeneous in the sense that different junctions are characterized by different activation energies for detachment of strands .",
    "the theory of temporary networks has been applied to describe the time - dependent behavior of polypropylene in the solid state in @xcite , to mention a few .",
    "the previous studies , however , did not pay much attention to the effect of molecular weight on material parameters in the constitutive equations .",
    "the fact that the viscoelastic response of polypropylene melts is strongly affected by the distribution of chains lengths has been established experimentally in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to evaluate the influence of mass - average molecular weight on ( i ) the concentration of active strands in an equivalent network , and ( ii ) the distribution function for temporary junctions with various activation energies .",
    "the exposition is organized as follows .",
    "first , experimental data in torsional oscillation tests are reported on annealed specimens , and their mass - average molecular weight is determined by using observations for complex viscosity . afterwards ,",
    "kinetic equations are developed for changes in the concentration of chains with various lengths induced by thermal treatment .",
    "adjustable parameters in these equations are determined by fitting the observations for molecular weight .",
    "we proceed with the derivation of stress ",
    "strain relations for an heterogeneous transient network at three - dimensional deformations with small strains .",
    "the constitutive equations involve three material constants that are found by matching the data for storage and loss moduli as functions of frequency of oscillations .",
    "finally , we establish correlations between the adjustable parameters in the stress ",
    "strain relations and the mass - average molecular weight of the polypropylene matrix and discuss the physical meaning of these relationships .",
    "isotactic polypropylene pp 1012 ( density 0.906 g/@xmath6 , melt flow rate 1.2 g/10 min ) was purchased from bp amoco polymers , inc . concentrate c44pa containing 43 wt.% of intercalated montmorillonite clay in de - agglomerated form was supplied by nanocor co.    to prepare hybrid nanocomposite with 5 wt.% of mmt clay , appropriate amounts of isotactic polypropylene and the concentrate were dried overnight at the temperature @xmath7  @xmath1c , pellets were mixed and melt - blended in a twin - screw extruder ( brabender instruments , inc . ) with a screw rate of 30 rpm and temperatures in the extruder barrel of 260 , 290 , 300 and 290  @xmath1c from hopper to die , respectively .",
    "strands from the extruder were cooled in a water bath , cut with a pelletizer , and dried in an oven at 100  @xmath1c for 12 h. circular plates with diameter 64 mm and thickness 3 mm were molded in injection - molding machine battenfeld 1000/315 cdc ( battenfeld ) .",
    "specimens for mechanical tests ( with diameter 30 mm ) were cut from the plates .",
    "our choice of the concentration of mmt clay in the hybrid nanocomposite ( @xmath8 wt.% ) is explained by the fact that this amount of nanoclay is sufficient to improve substantially mechanical properties of neat polypropylene . according to @xcite , the tensile strength of ipp  mmt nanocomposite reaches its maximum when the clay concentration equals 5 wt.% .",
    "another reason for this choice is that reinforcement of conventional polymers with mmt clay at higher concentrations of filler practically does not improve their thermal stability @xcite .    to evaluate the melting temperature @xmath5 of the matrix and the nanocomposite , dsc ( differential scanning calorimetry ) measurements were preformed by using dsc 910s apparatus ( ta instruments ) .",
    "the calorimeter was calibrated with indium as a standard .",
    "two specimens of neat ipp and ipp  mmt nanocomposite with weights of approximately 13 mg were tested with a heating rate of 10 k / min from room temperature to 200  @xmath1c under nitrogen .",
    "the melting temperature @xmath9  @xmath1c was determined for isotactic polypropylene as the point corresponding to the peak on the melting curves .",
    "no substantial changes in the melting temperature were found for the nanocomposite .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with the results of previous studies @xcite .",
    "to analyze lattice spacing in the montmorillonite clay and changes in the crystalline morphology of ipp driven by the presence of filler , x  ray diffraction tests were performed on isotactic polypropylene and polypropylene  clay nanocomposite by using rugaku d - max b diffractometer with cu ",
    "k@xmath10 radiation ( @xmath11  ) generated by a tube with a voltage of 40 kv and a current of 30 ma .",
    "the bragg scattering angle ranged from @xmath12 to @xmath13 with the step of 0.06@xmath1 .",
    "the diffraction spectrum of the hybrid nanocomposite revealed two peaks : a rather large and wide intensity maximum at @xmath14 ( the basal spacing of 30  ) and a smaller one at @xmath15 ( the basal spacing of 17  ) .",
    "the presence of these peaks indicated a high level of intercalation of polymer chains between clay platelets .",
    "these observations are similar to those found by other researchers @xcite on ipp  mmt nanocomposites with similar concentrations of clay .    among other interesting features of the x - ray diffractograms",
    ", we would mention : ( i ) an increase in @xmath16 peak of the nanocomposite compared to that of ipp ( by a factor of 5 ) , ( ii ) the growth of @xmath17 peak ( by a factor of 3.3 ) , ( iii ) a decrease in @xmath18 peak ( by 26 % ) , ( iv ) the formation of @xmath19 peak at @xmath20 , ( v ) the disappearance of @xmath21 and @xmath22 peaks , and ( vi ) a strong growth of @xmath23 peak at @xmath24 ( by a factor of 3.5 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that a pronounced reduction in the diffraction peaks at @xmath25 was recently reported in @xcite for hot - stretched polypropylene samples .",
    "it was associated with preferential orientation of crystallites driven by deformation of specimens . with reference to this assertion",
    ", the fact that the @xmath21 and @xmath22 peaks were not observed in the nanocomposite may be ascribed to the effect of anisotropically distributed clay platelets on the orientation of lamellar blocks in injection - molded samples .",
    "dynamic tests were performed by using rms-800 rheometric mechanical spectrometer with parallel disks ( diameter 25 mm , gap length 2 mm ) .",
    "the shear storage modulus @xmath26 and the shear loss modulus @xmath27 were measured in oscillation tests ( the frequency - sweep mode ) with the amplitude of 15 % and various frequencies @xmath28 ranging from 0.1 to 100 rad / s .",
    "the choice of the amplitude of oscillations was driven by the following requirements : ( i ) mechanical tests were performed in the region of linear viscoelasticity , and ( ii ) the torque was less than its ultimate value 0.2 n@xmath29 m .",
    "the limitation on the minimum frequency of oscillations was imposed by the condition that the torque exceeded its minimum value @xmath30 n@xmath29 m . to check that the storage and loss moduli were not affected by the strain amplitude",
    ", several tests were repeated with the amplitude of 5 % .",
    "no change in the dynamic moduli was observed .",
    "the temperature in the chamber was controlled with a standard thermocouple that showed that the temperature of specimens remained practically constant ( with the accuracy of @xmath31  @xmath1c ) .",
    "prior to mechanical tests , specimens were annealed in the spectrometer at the temperatures @xmath2 , 270 , 290 and 310  @xmath1c ( with gap length 3 mm ) for various amounts of time @xmath4 ranging from 15 min to 7 h ( 420 min ) .",
    "after thermal treatment of a specimen , the temperature was reduced to the test temperature @xmath0  @xmath1c , the specimen was thermally equilibrated ( during 5 min ) , the gap length was reduced to 2 mm , an extraneous material was carefully removed , and the shear storage and loss moduli were measured at various frequencies @xmath28 starting from the lowest one .",
    "each test was performed on a new specimen .",
    "we suppose that squeezing of samples between plates of the spectrometer and removal of the extraneous material substantially reduced the effect of thermo - oxidative degradation ( compared to that of thermal degradation ) on the mechanical response , because the major part of the material where oxidative degradation occurred was taken away ( about one third of the initial mass of each specimen ) .",
    "however , we can not exclude entirely the effect of diffusion of oxygen to the central part of the samples , in particular , at the highest temperatures ( @xmath32 and 310  @xmath1c ) used in the experiments @xcite .    the storage @xmath26 and loss @xmath27 moduli , as well as the modulus of the complex viscosity @xmath33 are plotted versus the logarithm ( @xmath34 ) of frequency @xmath28 in figures 1 to 12 ( conventional semi - logarithmic plots are used to characterize changes in these quantities with frequency ) .",
    "the shapes of the curves presented coincide qualitatively with those reported by other researchers , see , e.g. , @xcite . given an annealing time @xmath4 and an annealing temperature @xmath3 ,",
    "the storage modulus @xmath26 and the loss modulus @xmath27 strongly increase with frequency , whereas the complex viscosity @xmath33 noticeably decreases with @xmath28 . for a fixed frequency @xmath28 ,",
    "the dynamic moduli are pronouncedly reduced with @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "to assess changes in the molecular weight of the hybrid nanocomposite induced by thermal degradation of the matrix , the experimental dependencies @xmath35 depicted in figures 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 are approximated by the cross model @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the high - frequency complex viscosity ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the zero - frequency complex viscosity ( @xmath41 ) , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are adjustable parameters .",
