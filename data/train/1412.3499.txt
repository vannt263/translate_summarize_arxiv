    "the first step in photosynthesis is the capture of photons , which occurs predominantly in the light - harvesting complexes ( lhcs ) .",
    "the lhcs of the photosystems i and ii ( psi and psii ) consist of hundreds of light - sensitive , protein bound chlorophyll molecules .",
    "a quantum of sunlight , which is absorbed by a chlorophyll molecule , has rather high energy , on the order of @xmath4 .",
    "nature has developed a mechanism to transfer this locally excited electron energy ( exciton ) very efficiently ( @xmath5 ) from the peripheral lhc to the reaction center ( rc ) , where charge separation and complex chemical reactions take place . because a network of the exciton transfer ( et ) through the lhc to the rc includes many light - sensitive molecules and is rather complicated and quasi - random",
    ", the dynamics of the et must be very rapid in order for the exciton not to be lost to fluorescence , thermal fluctuations of the protein environment , and other electromagnetic processes .",
    "indeed , the dynamics of the et is rather fast , from one to tens of picoseconds .",
    "it was recently demonstrated , that quantum coherent effects survive ( and significantly enhance the efficiency ) in lhcs and rcs during the primary processes of et for times of order of hundreds of femtoseconds , even at room temperature @xcite .",
    "( see also references therein . )",
    "the structure of the lhc psii ( supercomplex ) is very complicated , and includes more than 300 light - sensitive chlorophyll ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) molecules , which contain excitonic sites ( similar to connected quantum dots in solids ) connected in a very complicated network .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite , and references therein . )",
    "these excitonic sites are embedded in a protein environment that operates as ( i ) the thermal bath and noise generator for excitonic sites of light - sensitive @xmath8 and ( ii ) an external media that changes in time its geometrical configuration ( conformations ) into different operational modes . in particular , it is well - known that if even one amino acid in the protein sequence is modified , this can potentially change the protein conformation or alter the energy levels of @xmath8 and their ability to function .",
    "these conformational modifications result in changes of locations and energy levels of the light - sensitive sites including interacting carotenoids and , consequently , the light - harvesting properties of the whole system @xcite .    in order to better characterize the et properties inside the peripheral light - harvesting supercomplex , it is conventionally divided into ( i ) the most peripheral  major \" lhcs @xcite which have a trimeric structure , and ( ii ) minor complexes more closely associated with the psii rc which include cp24 , cp26 , cp29 , cp43 , and cp47 , located between the rc and the peripheral lhcii complex @xcite .",
    "all these lhcii and minor complexes include a network of chlorophylls and carotenoids that absorb the solar quanta , and , as it was mentioned above , transfer the excitons from the antenna to the rc .",
    "note , that the sun energy is so diluted , that when modeling the exciton dynamics , under normal sunlight intensity , it is often assumed that only the lowest - lying singlet excited states of chlorophylls are required @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "when the solar flux levels exceed the capacity of downstream electron transfer processes , the rc becomes saturated , and several  damaging \" channels are opened .",
    "these damaging channels result in unwanted photo - damaging effects , that can destroy the whole organism .",
    "this process is called photoinhibition @xcite .",
    "photosynthetic organisms have evolved many mechanisms which protect them from damaging processes associated with high sunlight intensity @xcite .",
    "one of these mechanisms , is  nonphotochemical quenching \" ( npq ) .",
    "npq is induced by the low ph of the thylakoid lumen and involves multiple steps including the ph dependent de - epoxidation of violoxanthin to zeaxanthin to dissipate excess excited states as heat .",
    "many scientific teams have been involved for years in theoretical and experimental analysis , and in mathematical modeling of these npq mechanisms @xcite .",
    "( see also references therein . )",
    "but because the lhc network is very complicated and because npq mechanisms involve many complex physiological aspects of the photosynthetic organisms , still neither the detailed location of excitonic sites inside the antenna nor the detailed mechanisms responsible for quenching processes have been established .",
    "for example , models describing the npq mechanisms vary , from relatively simple , which involve three @xcite or four @xcite excitonic and charge transfer states , to very complicated , which involve 26 nonlinear ordinary differential equations with 78 fitting parameters @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", some components of the npq are generally accepted .",
    "for example , it is generally believed that npq is regulated by protonation processes and , correspondingly , by the magnitude of the trans - membrane ph gradient across the thylakoid membrane .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite , and references therein . )",
    "it is also believed by many that the npq requires the presence of the antenna - associated psbs ( plants ) or lhcsr ( green algae ) and other proteins which regulate the npq process by as of yet unknown mechanisms @xcite .",
    "overall , however , it would be useful to have a simple and consistent quantum - mechanical mathematical model which ( i ) is _ linear _ for the reduced density matrix elements ( as required by quantum mechanics ) and ( ii ) allows one to analyze , describe and better understand some important fragments of these very complicated and multi - functional npq mechanisms .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a simple quantum mathematical model which allows us to simulate a possible role of quantum interference ( coherent ) effects and quantum effects due to the interaction of discrete energy levels ( associated with light - sensitive sites ) with the continuum parts of the electron energy spectrum ( sinks ) , in the npq mode . for purposes of illustration of our approach",
    ", our model is based on the npq analysis used in @xcite , in which the formation of the carotenoid zeaxanthin ( zea ) and a creation of the @xmath9 heterodimer and charge transfer state ( cts ) , @xmath3 , were discussed in the cp29 and others minor antenna complexes , in the npq phase .",
    "( for creation of the @xmath9 heterodimer see , for example , @xcite . ) in particular , in @xcite , one possible role of the charge - transfer quenching ( ctq ) was considered in three minor antenna complexes , cp29 , cp26 , and cp24 .",
    "the authors of @xcite argued that the ctq in cp29 involves ( i ) a delocalized state of the _ strongly _ coupled dimer of the two chlorophylls , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , ( ii ) a heterodimer which includes the @xmath12 molecule , and ( iii ) the cts of this heterodimer .",
    "our model includes five excited discrete excitonic and charge transfer states which could be responsible for the npq mechanism : ( i ) two excited states of chlorophylls , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which can be initially populated either in the excited state of a single @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( when the dimer is weakly coupled ) , or in the excited eigenstate(s ) of the dimer , @xmath13 , when the dimer is strongly coupled ; ( ii ) a damaging excited electron state , @xmath14 , which is responsible for production of damaging outcomes such as very reactive singlet oxygen , and others ; ( iii ) the @xmath2 heterodimer excited state ; and ( iv ) the cts of this heterodimer , @xmath3 .    in our model , the two sites , @xmath14 and @xmath3 ,",
    "are described by discrete electron energy levels interacting with their continuum spectra ( sinks ) .",
    "this approach is in many aspects relevant to modeling of unstable quantum systems , such as heavy nuclei , solid - state nano - systems , and others @xcite . in this case",
    ", the initial system ( reactant ) undergoes an irreversible ( or quasi - irreversible , with possible recurrences ) decay through some channels ( reactions ) into the final state(s ) ( product(s ) ) .",
    "we associate one sink with the damaging state , @xmath15 , and another sink with the cts , @xmath16 . these two sinks play , in some respect , a similar role as two potential quenching channels , but with particular functions .    we assume , that when the light intensity is high enough , the psii rc is closed by the mechanism(s ) similar to the coulomb blockade regime in a quantum dot , in solids .",
    "namely , if one electron populates already the small quantum dot ( rc ) , the second electron can not occupy the same energy level in the dot , but could occupy the next excited level in the dot , which usually requires large additional energy , if the dot is small .",
    "but because at high light intensity , the number of photons that correspond to the first excited chlorophyll state increases , the next exciton may appear . in this case , when this ",
    "extra \" exciton populates the lhc chlorophyll dimer , its electron can not be transfered to the psii rc .",
    "instead , it can be transfered to the damaging state , @xmath15 , or to participate in the npq , or to be involved in many different processes .",
    "so , in our model , we do not use directly the highly excited states of the chlorophyll molecules .",
    "but they can easily be included in our model .",
    "the electron of the initially populated exciton , in the npq regime , exists in different  forms \" : ( i ) it can belong to the exciton which travels through the network of the lhc , and only slightly reducing ( or accumulating from the environment ) its energy ; ( ii ) it can be absorbed by the damaging sink , @xmath17 , and participate in creation of damaging product states ; or ( iii ) can be absorbed by the sink , @xmath18 , of the cts , and participate in non - harmful chemical reactions .",
    "this last option is called a ctq .",
    "certainly , according to quantum mechanics , this electron can also exist in a superposition of all these and other states of our model .",
    "each sink in our model is characterized by two parameters : the rate , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , of transfer into the sink , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , from the corresponding attached discrete state , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , and the efficiency ( cumulative time - dependent probability ) , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , of being absorbed by this sink .",
    "note , that both @xmath25 and @xmath26 , characterize only the rates of _ destruction _ of the exciton in the lhc , and do not describe the following processes with the occurred electron in the damaging and the charge transfer reactions . in this sense",
    ", our model describes only the primary npq processes related to the et , and does not describe the processes which occur in both sinks .",
    "the later occur on relatively large time - scales , and require a detailed knowledge of the structures of the sinks , and additional methods for their analysis .",
    "all five excitonic sites interact with their protein environment , which we model by the stochastic process of stationary telegraph noise .",
    "note , that there are many different approaches for modeling the influence of the protein environment on the excitonic and electron sites in bio - systems @xcite .",
    "some of them use a thermal bath ( for example , as a set of harmonic oscillators in the initial gibbs distribution , at a given temperature ) ; some approaches use the external sources of noise ; and some approaches are based on hybrid schemes @xcite . from our viewpoint , in the case of bio - systems in a _ non - functional _ mode , it is reasonable to use a thermal bath as the source of fluctuations which the electron sites experience from the protein environment .",
    "but when bio - systems are operating in their functional modes , the question of the proper modeling of the action of protein environment on embedded network of excitonic and electron sites is more complicated .",
    "it is most likely that some environmental modes act on the excitonic and electron sites as thermal bath modes , some as external noise ( generators ) , and some even as regular forces . in particular",
    ", this can be the case for very fast primary et dynamics in which many modes of the environment do not have time to approach their equilibrium states .",
    "( see also discussions on this issue in @xcite . )",
    "we have chosen the model of the random telegraph noise mainly for two reasons : ( i ) we believe that the influence of the interference and sink effects on the npq process , which we consider , can be reasonably described by a stochastic environment .",
    "( ii ) the set of linear ordinary differential equations for the et , which we derive , is exact and closed .",
    "this allows us to derive  exact \" numerical solutions , and to avoid dealing with the uncertainties caused by different approximations used .",
    "this is especially important when the interaction constants between the excitonic sub - system and the environment are sufficiently large , as often happens in bio - systems at room temperature @xcite , and it becomes impossible to derive an exact and closed system of equations for the excitonic ( and electron ) reduced density matrix .    in the npq regime ,",
    "when structural changes in the cp29 complex occur ( in particular , due to protonation , psbs protein involvement , and other processes @xcite ) , the excited state(s ) of the lhc chlorophyll dimer , @xmath13 , is realized and is initially populated . in this case , we numerically find the conditions required to suppress the damaging channel , for both limits of weakly and strongly coupled @xmath13 lhc dimers . in particular , for the case of a strongly coupled dimer , we demonstrate the suppression of the damaging channel caused by the simultaneous action of quantum interference effects and sinks .    in order to demonstrate our results ,",
    "we explicitly calculate all averaged over noise density matrix elements for the discrete states as well as the  efficiencies \" of both the damaging channel , @xmath27 , and the charge transfer channel , @xmath28 . for concreteness",
    ", we apply our results to describe a possible contribution of quantum interference and sink effects in the npq mechanism in the cp29 minor complex . at the same time",
    ", we should note that we do not intend here to fit our numerical results with the experimental results on the npq process in the cp29 complex .",
    "there are two main reasons for this .",
    "first , we do not think that this fitting is reasonable at present time , because many details are currently unknown , such as the location of the responsible excitonic sites and states , characteristics of the lhc dimer and heterodimer in the npq mode , the values of rates between sites and to the sinks , and other important parameters .",
    "second , by varying many fitting parameters , ( such as energy levels , values of interaction matrix elements , rates to the sinks , interaction constants between sites and noise , decay rate of noise correlations ) , one can match the particular results of numerical simulations with the particular experimental results . instead",
    ", our main intention here is to discuss a possible role of quantum interference and sink effects in the npq mechanism .",
    "one advantage of our model is that it can be easily generalized including as many as needed excitonic states , ctss and damaging channels , much more complex networks of interconnected excitonic sites , and a proper combination of thermal environment and external noise , in order to model the protein environment in the npq mode .",
    "+ our main results include : +   + 1 .",
    "an exact and closed system of linear ordinary differential equations for the averaged over noise excitonic density matrix , which describes the influence of quantum interference effects , sinks , and noise on the npq process in the lhcs .",

    "this parameter is the probability of finding the electron in the sink of the damaging channel ( efficiency ) .",

    "our model includes five discrete excitonic energy states ( see fig . [ s2 ] ) : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and two sinks , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "we use the following notation .",
    "the discrete electron state , @xmath32 , is the excited electron state of chlorophyll , @xmath33 .",
    "the discrete electron state , @xmath34 , is the excited electron state of chlorophyll , @xmath35 .",
    "so , in our model only two chlorophylls , @xmath33 and @xmath35 , each with an excited electron state , participate in the npq process , as in @xcite .",
    "the discrete state , @xmath36 , is the heterodimer excited state .",
    "the discrete state , @xmath37 , is the cts of the heterodimer .",
    "the state , @xmath38 , is a discrete part of the damaging state ( channel ) .",
    "[ s2 ] demonstrates the npq regime in which ( i ) the weakly or strongly coupled dimer ( shown in the rectangle ) is realized based on two site states , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , ( ii ) initially one of two eigenstates of the dimer is populated .",
    "( for a weakly coupled dimer , this corresponds approximately to the initial population , either @xmath0 ( @xmath39 ) or @xmath1 ( @xmath40 ) . )",
    "the sink , @xmath17 , is the continuum part of the damaging state ( channel ) , @xmath15 .",
    "the sink , @xmath18 , is the continuum part of the cts ( channel ) , @xmath16 .",
    "all matrix elements , @xmath31 , in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) describe the interactions between the discrete excitonic states .",
    "the parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( see below ) , characterize the rates of escape from the discrete states , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , to their corresponding sinks .",
    "note , that the dynamics of escape from a discrete energy level to its associated continuum can be described by a single rate , @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 ) , only in the approximation of an infinitely wide band of the sink .",
    "( the weisskopf - wigner model @xcite . ) for narrow or intermediate band of the sink , the dynamics of escape to the continuum is more complicated , and can not be described by a single rate .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite . )",
    "but for the purposes of this paper , we will use the weisskopf - wigner approximation for both sinks , assuming that for narrow or intermediate band of the sink , a single average ( or renormalized ) escape rate could be used .    in our model , the dimer shown in fig .",
    "[ s2 ] can , in principle , interact with the site , @xmath41 , in two different ways : ( 1 ) both matrix elements , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( not shown in fig .",

    "an important part of our model is the stochastic protein environment .",
    "we use an interaction of the system with the environment in the form of  diagonal \" stationary telegraph noise , @xmath48 , which acts on all five _ discrete _ states , @xmath29 , and does not include  non - diagonal \" components .",
    "note , that our model allows a generalization by considering independent noises acting on different excitonic sites @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the interaction constants with noise can be different at all five sites ( discrete energy levels ) .",
    "however , if one chooses equal constants of interaction with noise , @xmath48 , at all five different sites , the effect of noise disappears .",
    "( the same occurs if one uses a thermal bath instead of noise . )",
    "this does not happen if independent noises act on different sites @xcite .",
    "here we would like to make three comments .",
    "first , diagonal noise ( or a diagonal thermal bath ) was previously used ( with some conditions ) in the marcus theory @xcite , and in many of its generalizations , including the description of coherent quantum effects in et in lhcs , mentioned above .",
    "note , that the interaction with diagonal noise leads to the relaxation processes of the et indirectly  only through the matrix elements , @xmath49 in the hamiltonian , below .",
    "on the other hand , a non - diagonal noise ( or a non - diagonal interaction with the thermal bath ) leads also to _ direct _ relaxation processes @xcite .",
    "second , the effects of non - diagonal noise ( or a non - diagonal interaction with the thermal bath ) could be important under some conditions @xcite , which we do not discuss here ( as they are believed to reveal themselves on time - scale larger than the primary et processes considered here ) .",
    "third , usually the protein environment is modeled by a thermal bath , instead of external ( classical ) noise @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that the long - time asymptotic leads for a thermal bath to a gibbs distribution ( in the diagonal representation of the system hamiltonian ) . at the same time , for noise , the long - time asymptotic leads to equal distribution .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite , and references therein . ) because room temperature corresponds to , @xmath50 , the difference between these two asymptotics becomes significant for the redox potential ( distance between the donor and acceptor energy levels ) , @xmath51 . as mentioned above , there are also the hybrid approaches which allow one to model a thermal environment using stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "we use an approach based on a noisy environment mainly for the following three reasons : first , we believe that for our purposes the noisy environment is an adequate approach , since the npq mechanism in our model leads to rapid saturation ( stationary regime ) , which usually reveals itself on a time - scale less than the time of equilibration in the system with only discrete electron energy levels .",
    "second , as mentioned above , it should be expected that most bio - systems operate in the functional mode ( including the npq ) , in noisy not thermal environment , or at least , in combination .",
    "third , the use of random telegraph noise allows us to derive an _",
    "exact _ system of linear ordinary differential equations for the reduced density matrix , which describes the npq process in our model .",
    "( for an approach based on a thermal bath at room temperature , with a relatively strong constant of interaction between the system and the bath , the exact system of equations is not known @xcite . moreover",
    ", a controlled perturbation theory also does not exist at present .",
    ") this is important for our analysis , as our main intention is to describe the dynamics of the npq process , which is much easier to do by using an exact system of equations .",
    "generally , we consider the system with @xmath52 discrete energy levels ( excitonic sites ) , with each level coupled to its independent sink .",

    "then , the geometries of the chlorophyll molecules and the orientations of their transitional dipole moments become important . in particular , in the degenerate case , @xmath106 , when @xmath110 , the antisymmetric eigenstate , @xmath112 , is the ground state of the dimer , with the eigenenergy , @xmath113 . when @xmath111 , the symmetric eigenstate , @xmath114 , is the ground state of the dimer , with the same energy .",
    "note , that the interaction of the two chlorophylls , which form the dimer , can have a rather complicated dependence on the distance between them .",
    "namely , the frster dipole - dipole type of interaction for relatively large distances ( @xmath115 ) can be modified for the dexter mechanism for small distances ( @xmath116 ) , which involves the electron exchange interaction @xcite .    when the two chlorophylls , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , form the strongly coupled dimer , so that @xmath119 , the parameter , @xmath120 , can be small , but the matrix element of their interaction can become large enough , if the chlorophylls are near each other . in this case , @xmath121 .",
    "this sort of the chlorophyll dimer is realized in the so - called h - aggregate quasi - parallel molecules .",
    "the upper - lying state , @xmath122 , is called the  bright \" (  dipole - allowed \" ) state , and the low - lying state , @xmath123 , is called the  dark \" (  dipole - forbidden \" ) state that traps the exciton @xcite .",
    "introduce the parameter , @xmath124 it is easy to see that when @xmath125 , both eigenstates , ( [ phim ] ) and ( [ phip ] ) , become close to the unperturbed states ( [ one ] ) of two separated chlorophylls .",
    "in this case , the lhc dimer is called  weakly coupled \" .",
    "the lhc dimer is called  strongly coupled \" when , the value of @xmath126 is not too small .",

    "in particular , the lhc dimer based on two chlorophylls , @xmath133 , was specified : @xmath134 , @xmath135 ; @xmath136 .",

    "the value of the parameter @xmath126 is : @xmath138 .",
    "so , this dimer should be considered to be weakly coupled .",
    "( note that the heterodimers based on two chlorophylls , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , are also weakly coupled in many other bio - systems , not only in the cp29 antenna complex . )",
    "however , below , in our numerical simulations , we will consider both weakly and strongly coupled cases for the dimer , @xmath13 , in fig .",
    "[ s2 ] ( shown in the rectangle ) .",
    "the main reason is that in the npq mode , when the protein environment experiences conformational modifications , the characteristics of the dimer , @xmath13 , can also change .",
    "indeed , the reconstruction energy and the interaction matrix element , @xmath105 , could increase significantly .",
    "also , because of protonation in the npq mode , the local electric fields on the sites can change , resulting in modification of the redox potential .",
    "then , the weakly coupled dimer could become a strongly coupled dimer .",
    "additional experimental efforts are required in order to determine when this occurs .      both above states ,",
    "@xmath130 and @xmath131 , are eigenstates only of the isolated dimer .",
    "when the dimer is formed , its interaction with sunlight should include an additional term in the hamiltonian ( [ hd ] ) : @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the operator of the optical dipole transition , and @xmath143 is the electric field of sunlight .",
    "then , in frequency units , this additional term is proportional the the rabi frequency , @xmath144 . in this case , the above states , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , are not eigenstates of the system . also , this dimer interacts in real systems with other sites , which makes the hamiltonian ( [ hd ] ) even more complicated .",
    "so , the dark state , @xmath131 , can be significantly populated .",
    "another way to populate the dark state is through the non - radiative transition : @xmath145 @xcite .    in the numerical simulations below , when populating initially the lhc dimer , @xmath13 , we mainly use the initial condition for the wave function of the whole system shown in fig .",
