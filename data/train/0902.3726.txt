    "many of high energy theories of fundamental physics , including supergravity and superstring theories , are formulated in spacetimes having compact spatial dimensions . from an inflationary point of view",

    "the models of a compact universe with non - trivial topology may play an important role by providing proper initial conditions for inflation .",
    "there are many reasons to expect that in string theory the most natural topology for the universe is that of a flat compact three - manifold @xcite . the quantum creation of the universe having toroidal spatial topology is discussed in @xcite and in references @xcite within the framework of various supergravity theories",
    ". an interesting application of the quantum field theoretical models with non - trivial topology of spatial dimensions recently appeared in nanophysics @xcite . in a sheet of hexagons from the graphite structure , known as graphene",
    ", the long - wavelength description of the electronic states can be formulated in terms of the dirac - like theory of massless spinors in 3-dimensional spacetime with the fermi velocity playing the role of speed of light ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "single - walled carbon nanotubes are generated by rolling up a graphene sheet to form a cylinder and the background spacetime for the corresponding dirac - like theory has topology @xmath0 . compactifying the direction along the cylinder axis we obtain another class of graphene made structures called toroidal carbon nanotubes with the background topology @xmath1 .",
    "the compactification of spatial dimensions leads to a number of interesting quantum field theoretical effects which include instabilities in interacting field theories @xcite , topological mass generation @xcite , symmetry breaking @xcite . in the case of nontrivial topology",
    "the boundary conditions imposed on fields give rise to the modification of the spectrum for vacuum fluctuations and , as a result , to the casimir - type contributions in the vacuum expectation values of physical observables ( for the topological casimir effect and its role in cosmology see @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the casimir effect is common to all systems characterized by fluctuating quantities and has important implications on all scales , from cosmological to subnuclear . in the kaluza - klein - type models",
    "this effect has been used as a stabilization mechanism for moduli fields which parametrize the size and the shape of the extra dimensions .",
    "the casimir energy can also serve as a model for dark energy needed for the explanation of the present accelerated expansion of the universe ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to its fundamental interest the casimir effect also plays an important role in the fabrication and operation of nano- and micro - scale mechanical systems ( see , for instance , @xcite ) and has become an increasingly popular topic in quantum field theory .",
    "the effects of the toroidal compactification of spatial dimensions on the properties of quantum vacuum for various spin fields have been discussed by several authors ( see , for instance , @xcite,@xcite-@xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . in the present paper , we investigate one - loop quantum effects arising from vacuum fluctuations of a massive fermionic field on background of higher - dimensional spacetimes with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions .",
    "we will assume generalized periodicity conditions along compactified dimensions with arbitrary phases .",
    "important quantities that characterize the quantum fluctuations are the fermionic condensate and the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor . in the next section , by using the abel - plana summation formula , we derive a recurrence formula relating the fermionic condensates in topologies @xmath2 and @xmath3 . an alternative expression for the topological part in the fermionic condensate",

    "<S> fermionic condensate and the vacuum expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor are investigated for a massive spinor fields in higher - dimensional spacetimes with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions . by using the abel - plana summation formula and the zeta function technique we present the vacuum expectation values in two different forms . </S>",
    "<S> applications of the general formulae to cylindrical and toroidal carbon nanotubes are given . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the topological casimir energy is positive for metallic cylindrical nanotubes and is negative for semiconducting ones . </S>",
    "<S> the toroidal compactification of a cylindrical nanotube along its axis increases the casimir energy for metallic - type ( periodic ) boundary conditions along its axis and decreases the casimir energy for the semiconducting - type compactifications .    </S>",
