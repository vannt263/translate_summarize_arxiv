    "in both lagrangian and eulerian inviscid fluid dynamics , a dissipation is normally adopted to handle discontinuities in the flow ( the riemann problem ) .",
    "an artificial viscosity is introduced in sph , as a shock capturing method , to prevent particle interpenetration and to smooth out spurious heating in the flow to solve the strictly hyperbolic system of euler equations .",
    "the introduction of such a small dissipation is also currently adopted to produce both mass and angular momentum transport in sph physically inviscid modelling of accretion discs in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "efforts were accomplished in sph to solve both the `` approximate '' and the `` exact '' riemann problem , either via an explicit reformulation of the artificial viscosity term @xcite or via sophisticated godunov algorithms @xcite which also include an `` intrinsic '' implicit dissipation . in the first case ,",
    "a reformulation of the artificial viscosity could be necessary because , for `` weak shocks '' or low mach numbers , the fluid becomes `` too viscous '' and angular momentum and vorticity could be non - physically transferred . an alternative physical way to solve the riemann problem , based on a reformulation of the eos in the euler equations ,",
    "is here presented , where particle sph pressure terms are recalculated without any artificial viscosity contribution .    in this paper",
    "we do not solve the riemann problem by proposing a numerical algorithm , i.e. a riemann solver .",
    "instead we try to solve the riemann problem , invalidating the stability of solutions of the hyperbolic euler equations of inviscid flows , in a strictly physical sense , searching for an eos for ideal gases including the correct dissipative contribution .",
    "this means that , even though we work in sph formulation , making the most of our experience , final results involve the eos in general .",
    "since shock flows are non equilibrium events , we pay attention that the eos : @xmath1 for ideal flows can not exactly be applied to solve the riemann problem .",
    "in fact such an equation is strictly valid only for equilibrium or for quasi - equilibrium thermodynamic states , whenever the velocity of propagation of perturbations equals the sound velocity .",
    "successful results , based on some form of mathematical dissipation introduced within the strictly hyperbolic system of non linear euler equations for ideal flows , are obtained due to the necessity to correct such a congenital defect . in  2 of this paper",
    ", we briefly recall how the sph method works for ideal non viscous flows . in the same  2 we also outline",
    "which evolution has been accomplished in the explicit artificial viscosity dissipation description . instead ,",
    "in  3 , we show how to reformulate the eos , according to the riemann problem for inviscid , ideal gases .",
    "analytical formulations of how a physical dissipation in non viscous flows for irreversible physical processes plays on thermodynamic properties is shown in  4 , according to statistical thermodynamics . in  5 a refinement of the same eos is also formulated to handle a dissipation that is also right for shear flows .",
    "applications to 1d shock tubes @xcite and to blast waves , to solve shocks , to 2d turbulence and 2d shear flows , are also shown in  6 , as well as a comparison to models adopting different dissipation that is also given for the coming out of spiral patterns in accretion discs in a cb ( see app .",

    "the adiabatic index @xmath11 has the meaning of a numerical parameter whose value lies in the range between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , in principle .",
    "the sph method is a lagrangian scheme that discretizes the fluid into moving interacting and interpolating domains called `` particles '' .",

'' however , the numerical viscous term should be large enough to spread out shock transitions only over a few resolution lengths , making shock waves resolvable . in this sense ,",
    "any mathematical dissipation should be considered a useful mathematical `` trick '' to get correct results .",

    "therefore , the solution of the lagrangian riemann problem , only in its pressure computation , is enough to interface sph with the riemann problem solution .",
    "the key concept is that the physical interpretation of the application of the artificial viscosity contribution in the pressure terms corresponds to a reformulation of the eos for inviscid ideal gases , whose equation :    @xmath106    is strictly applied in fluid dynamics when the gas components do not collide with each other . in the case of gas collisions , it modifies in :    @xmath107    the further term takes into account the velocity of perturbation propagation @xcite .",
    "this velocity equals the ideal gas sound velocity @xmath63 whenever we treat non collisional gases in equilibrium or in the case of rarefaction waves .",

    "the linear term @xmath116 is based on the viscosity of a gas .",
    "the quadratic term @xmath117 ( von neumann - richtmyer - like ) is necessary to handle strong shocks .",

    "that is the conversion of macroscopic kinetic energy into thermal energy , in so far as the thermodynamic system is always in thermal equilibrium , obeying markovian statistics .",
    "atoms or molecules do not interact with each other , and their internal quantum energies do not affect the global thermodynamics . in the maxwell - boltzmann distribution hypothesis ,",
    "this implies a transition from one maxwell - boltzmann statistical distribution to another one , whose half weight at half height is larger .",
    "if such a transition occurs during the shock crossing , the whole thermodynamic system could make an instantaneous transition between two thermodynamic equilibrium states .",
    "hence , the larger the half weight at half height of the statistical distribution , the larger the physical dissipation occurred .",
    "thus , writing @xmath160 or , that is the same : @xmath161 ,    @xmath162    the net effect of such a dissipation is the desired enlargement of the width at half height of each gaussian distribution for @xmath138 , conserving both @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",

    "both @xmath314 and @xmath315 in the disc s outer regions , free of any gas compression , where local kinematics is mainly keplerian at the disc s outer edge .",
    "this means that @xmath288 is locally negligible . on the other external components , as the injected particle stream",
    ", no local compression occurs . for radial distance @xmath316 , where the majority of disc s particles relies in the inner toroidal ring , both @xmath48 and @xmath49 increase since the kinematics deviates from a perfect keplerian behaviour and gas compression becomes effective there .",
    "this means that a non viscous hydrodynamics of a perfect gas , without a shear physical dissipation , also effective without any gas compression , can not produce any graduality in the radial transport .",
    "this implies that in an ideal gas , either the turbulent physical dissipation in a navier - stokes approach , or an inviscid eulerian fluid dynamics , where the riemann problem is correctly solved , must be considered to produce both a graduality in the radial transport , and spiral shaped structures and a statistically correct keplerian tangential kinematics in a disc .",

    "<S> in physically inviscid fluid dynamics , `` shock capturing '' methods adopt either an artificial viscosity contribution or an appropriate riemann solver algorithm . these techniques are necessary to solve the strictly hyperbolic euler equations if flow discontinuities ( the riemann problem ) are to be solved . a necessary dissipation is normally used in such cases . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit artificial viscosity contribution is normally adopted to smooth out spurious heating and to treat transport phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> such a treatment of inviscid flows is also widely adopted in the smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) finite volume free lagrangian scheme . in other cases , </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic dissipation of godunov - type methods is implicitly useful . </S>",
    "<S> instead `` shock tracking '' methods normally use the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions to solve such problems . </S>",
    "<S> a simple , effective solution of the riemann problem in inviscid ideal gases is here proposed , based on an empirical reformulation of the equation of state ( eos ) in the euler equations in fluid dynamics , whose limit for a motionless gas coincides with the classical eos of ideal gases . </S>",
    "<S> the application of such an effective solution to the riemann problem excludes any dependence , in the transport phenomena , on particle smoothing resolution length @xmath0 in non viscous sph flows . </S>",
    "<S> results on 1d shock tube tests , as well as examples of application for 2d shear flows are here shown . as an astrophysical application , a much better identification of spiral structures in accretion discs in a close binary ( cb ) , as a result of this reformulation is also shown here .    </S>",
