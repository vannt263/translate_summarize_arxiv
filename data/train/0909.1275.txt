    "turbulence is often referred to as the last unresolved main problem of classical physics .",
    "the diversity of applications of turbulent flows , from geophysics and astrophysics to engineering , and the observed complexity and lack of predictability of such flows both make the problem difficult to tackle , or even to define .",
    "part of this complexity is due to the fact that turbulence comes in intermittent `` gusts , '' strong events that are scarce , but still more frequent that what could be expected if normally distributed .",
    "these gusts give rise to the well - known break down of scale invariance in the flow @xcite .",
    "intermittency is a highly spatially and temporally localized phenomenon .",
    "it is believed to be associated only with a forward cascade of an ideal invariant ( a quantity conserved in the inviscid case ) , corresponding to the transfer of this quantity towards small scales with constant flux as a result of the non - linear coupling between modes ; it is not directly related with the dimensionality of the problem . as an example , the energy cascade from larger to smaller scales in isotropic and homogeneous three dimensional turbulence is intermittent @xcite .",
    "magnetofluids , i.e. , conducting fluids where the velocity field is coupled to the magnetic field , are intermittent in two @xcite and in three dimensions @xcite , and in both cases a direct cascade of energy takes place .",
    "these examples are in contrast with the two dimensional neutral fluid case , for which the conservation of vorticity leads to an inverse energy cascade ( a transfer of energy to the large scales with constant flux ) .",
    "while the direct cascade of enstrophy in this case is intermittent , there is evidence that the inverse cascade of energy is scale invariant and probability density functions of velocity fluctuations are close to gaussian @xcite . for the case of rotating turbulence ,",
    "studies of intermittency are not numerous since they require high reyolds numbers together with low rossby numbers ; moreover , since in this case energy undergoes both a direct and an inverse cascade @xcite , it is unclear _ a priori _ whether intermittency is to be expected in the small scales or not , although , until the present work ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : intermittency ] ) , there was no documented example of self - similar direct energy cascade to our knowledge . in experiments of freely decaying rotating turbulence @xcite",
    ", it was found that rotation significantly decreases intermittency , although strictly scale - invariant ( non - intermittent ) statistics were not found .",
    "such experimental results are also in agreement with recent analyses of data stemming from direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of non - helical rotating turbulence @xcite .",
    "other laboratory experiments @xcite reported an even more pronounced reduction of the intermittency when rotation is present .    although intermittency is believed to take place at small scales",
    ", strong events can affect the dynamics of the large scales , specially in systems close to criticality .",
    "as an example , it was shown in @xcite that local fluctuations of the kinetic helicity @xmath1 with @xmath2 the velocity , can explain phase and amplitude variations of the 22-years solar cycle .",
    "also , intermittency is known to affect the transport of momentum in atmospheric surface layers @xcite .",
    "considering the large number of degrees of freedom typical in turbulence ( typical mesoscale flows in the atmosphere of the earth can have , for instance , about @xmath3 degrees of freedom ) , many of the approaches to turbulence rely on an assumed scale invariance to model the flow statistics at small ( often unresolved ) scales .",
    "the search for self - similar quantities in three - dimensional turbulence is a long - standing problem , which would relate its study with critical phenomena and the out - of - equilibrium statistics of systems with a large number of modes , and which would allow the use of tools from quantum field theory , condensed matter , and statistical mechanics .    in a previous paper , hereafter referred to as paper i @xcite , we presented results from two massive numerical simulations of helical rotating turbulence .",
    "rotation and helicity are present in many atmospheric phenomena , as e.g. , supercell storms and tornadoes @xcite .",
    "the simulations confirmed the scaling laws for the energy and helicity spectra predicted in @xcite .",
    "the development of anisotropies in the flow , as well as scaling laws in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the axis of rotation were also studied , considering both global measurements of anisotropy as well as spectral quantities . in this paper",
    "we study the intermittent properties of both the direct cascade of energy and the direct cascade of helicity in helical rotating turbulence , using the data from the simulations presented in paper i. a decomposition into directions parallel and perpendicular to the axis of rotation is used to study anisotropy .",
    "details of this decomposition , as well as the definitions of increments , structure functions , and scaling exponents used to quantify the intermittency are given in sect .",

    "[ sec : structures ] and the conclusions are presented in sect . [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "to study intermittency in the direct cascade of energy , we will use longitudinal increments of the velocity field @xmath2 , @xmath5 \\cdot       \\frac{|\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\ell$}|}{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\ell$}},\\ ] ] where the increment @xmath6 can be in any direction .",

    "the structure functions depend on the direction of the increment , and no assumption about isotropy or axisymmetry has yet been made .",
    "the @xmath10 structure functions are of interest because for @xmath11 they are related to the two - point correlation function of the velocity , and thus to the energy spectrum through the convolution theorem .",
    "therefore , a power law behavior can be expected for scales corresponding to the inertial range .",
    "also , for the isotropic and homogeneous case , @xmath12 is related to the energy flux and scales linearly with the increment @xmath13 in the inertial range @xcite . as a result , if the direct cascade is scale invariant , for an isotropic and homogeneous flow @xmath14 , and departures of the exponents from this relation are a signature of intermittency .",
    "the study of intermittency in the direct cascade of helicity has been less explored . in the isotropic and homogeneous case , one can study it using for example structure functions based on the helicity flux , which is a third order field @xcite . in real space",

    "both relations are equivalent , as it is easy to see from @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , here we want structure functions that can be associated to the spectral scaling , and must therefore be based on second order quantities .",

    "the presence of rotation breaks down the isotropy of the flow , introducing a preferred direction .",

    "perpendicular to @xmath29 , the increments @xmath31 can be taken in every possible direction and later averaged to obtain structure functions that only depend on the scalar increment @xmath32 .",
    "however , this requires interpolation of the three components of the velocity in the three dimensional space every time an increment does not reside on a computational grid point . to avoid the computational cost of this interpolation , we follow the procedure introduced in @xcite for the isotropic case .",
    "we only compute increments given by the product of an integer times a generator vector , with the generator vectors chosen such that they fill as uniformly as possible circles in the plane perpendicular to @xmath29 , and such that their product with an integer always falls on a grid point .",

    "indeed , for small values of @xmath13 the parallel and perpendicular structure functions become closer .",
    "this is more evident in velocity structure functions of higher order . as an example , figure [ fig : s6 ] shows the sixth order velocity structure function . while an inertial range in the perpendicular direction is still visible ( the mean slope averaged over ten turnover times is indicated as a reference ) , and the structure functions in this direction do not change much between different snapshots , such is not the case at smaller scales , or in the parallel direction . in the parallel direction ,",

    "similarly to the stratified case , one can introduce a wavenumber at which rotation and nonlinear advection balance ( see @xcite ) : @xmath92 ( with @xmath93 the energy dissipation rate ) ; @xmath94 can be considered as the largest wavenumber where rotation effects are important ; the inverse of this wavenumber , @xmath95 , is equivalent to the ozmidov length in stratified turbulence , which separates the inertial range ( at smaller scales ) from the range dominated by buoyancy ( at larger scales ) .",

    "the velocity increments are expected to be gaussian . on the other hand , in an intermittent flow , probability density functions are expected to have strong non - gaussian tails .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo ] we show the probability density functions ( pdfs ) of the velocity and helicity increments in the direction perpendicular to the axis of rotation for four values of @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath106 .",
    "the pdfs are normalized by their variance , and a gaussian with the same variance is shown as a reference .",
    "the pdfs of velocity increments for @xmath142 and @xmath143 are close to gaussian .",
    "note that these increments correspond to scales in the anisotropic inertial range ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : s2 ] and [ fig : s6 ] ) .",
    "pdfs close to gaussian were also observed for @xmath145 for other increments in this range .",
    "however , for @xmath142 a `` bump '' ( which also decays as a gaussian ) can be observed in the tails .",
    "this bump disappears as smaller increments are considered , and seems to be associated with the forcing ( note that the mechanical forcing acts between @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) .",
    "the bump is more evident in the pdf of helicity increments with @xmath142 . for both values @xmath142 and @xmath143 ( in the direct cascade inertial range ) the pdfs of helicity increments are different than for velocity increments : deviations from gaussianity are evident , and the pdfs show strong tails .",
    "the non - gaussian tails are the signature of the presence of strong gradients , and of intermittency in the spatial distribution of helicity .",
    "these results confirm  independently of the scaling exponents analyzed in the preceding section  that the anisotropic direct cascade of energy towards smaller scales is close to gaussian and scale independent , while the direct cascade of helicity is intermittent .    for increments in the range of scales where @xmath87 is of the same order as @xmath88 for @xmath148 ( see e.g. , fig . [",
    "fig : s6 ] ) , both the pdfs of velocity and of helicity increments show non - gaussian tails ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : histo ] for @xmath149 and @xmath106 ) .",
    "this further confirms that at very small scales , the strongest events ( in the tails of the pdfs ) tend toward a recovery of isotropy , which would lead in turn to a traditional ( and intermittent ) direct cascade of energy .",
    "however , simulations at larger resolution and at different reynolds and rossby numbers will be required to verify if this recovery of isotropy occurs always near the dissipation range , or if a second isotropic inertial range develops when enough scale separation is available at scales smaller than the ozmidov scale when rotation can presumably be neglected .",
    "the results discussed in sect . [ sec : intermittency ] and [ sec : histo ] point towards an anisotropic and scale - invariant energy distribution in an intermediate range of scales ( smaller than the forcing scale ) , and a highly intermittent helicity distribution in the same range of scales . in helical rotating turbulence , energy cascades both towards large and small scales , while helicity cascades towards small scales dominating the direct cascade inertial range . in light of these facts",
    ", it is of interest to look at the structures that arise in the flow .    in figure [ fig:2d ]",
    "are displayed horizontal slices ( in the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis ) of the energy density , the vorticity intensity , the @xmath28 component of the velocity , and the helicity density in run b with @xmath59 , at @xmath150 .",
    "while the energy density seems organized in large - scale patches ( substantially larger than the forcing scale which corresponds roughly to @xmath151 of the box ) , the vorticity intensity and helicity density show small - scale structures .",
    "this is consistent with an inverse cascade of energy and a direct cascade dominated by the helicity .",
    "note however that the energy density distribution in space is different from the distribution observed in two dimensional turbulence , where an inverse cascade of energy also takes place ; in other words , the inverse cascade here differs from the purely two - dimensional case , be it only because the conservation of helicity ( in the ideal case ) induces the flow to keep some trace of three - dimensionality ( and isotropy ) at small scale , as noted before . moreover , smooth structures at some intermediate scale can be observed in the helicity and the vorticity ( see e.g. the left side of the box ) ; these regions are also correlated with similar regions in the @xmath28 component of the velocity .",
    "when run b is started from a previously isotropic state , the flow first becomes anisotropic and then a self - organization process starts that leads to the formation of columns . those columns can be identified when the energy density , helicity density , or the vorticity intensity are visualized .",
    "the columns have strong @xmath152 ( see e.g. fig . [ fig:3d ] ) .",
    "however , a few columns can be distinguished from the rest , in that they have a strong updraft velocity and concentrate in their core positive helicity , with strong relative helicity ( strong alignment between velocity and vorticity ) .",
    "these columns are stable , and we were able to track these columns in the simulation for over ten turnover times .",
    "far from these structures , the flow displays a myriad of small scales , as illustrated by the small - scale filaments in the helicity density .",
    "these filaments are also organized in columnar structures , but the thick columns with net helicity live for much longer times . as a result , in real space the inverse cascade of energy can be identified as the system evolves in time and these helical structures merge with columns with a lesser amount of relative helicity , increasing the characteristic width of the column when its energy density is visualized , but keeping the thickness of the helical core in the column approximately constant .",
    "this is the result of the helicity injected in the flow cascading directly to smaller scales , which allows for a localized helical column , but prevents the formation of a thick distribution of helicity in a column filling all space .",
    "accompanying the direct cascade , strong fluctuations of helicity are observed in the turbulent columns with the characteristic size of the vortex filaments .",
    "the analysis of the structure functions and of the probability density functions of velocity and helicity increments from data stemming from direct numerical simulations of helical rotating turbulence at high resolution , showed that , at least for the strongest events in the small scales , isotropy is recovered at sufficiently small scales .",
    "this is observed both in the collapse of the parallel and perpendicular structure functions , as well as in the transition from near - gaussian statistics of the velocity increments in the inertial range towards pdfs with strong tails in the same range of scales as observed in the structure functions .",
    "more studies will be required to see if this transition takes place for all orders when the reynolds number is large enough , leading to a sufficient scale separation .",
    "concerning scaling exponents , we also confirmed that in the anisotropic direct cascade range the velocity increments are ( within error bars ) scale invariant ( i.e. , non - intermittent ) while helicity increments are intermittent .",
    "this is further confirmed by the probability density functions , which show strong non - gaussian tails for the helicity , and are near gaussian for velocity increments in the anisotropic range .",
    "the scaling exponents for the helicity are consistent ( within error bars ) with a scale invariant dependence @xmath139 up to @xmath122 , but @xmath140 departs from a straight line .",
    "more data will be required to confirm a possible bi - fractal or multi - fractal scaling for the helicity , although we would like to point out that a bi - fractal scaling would be consistent with the two types of helical structures observed in visualizations of the flow ( the large - scale laminar columns and the small - scale vortex filaments ) , and reminiscent of the behavior or other systems with two type of structures , e.g. , the burgers equation , which develops smooth ramps connected by sharp shocks .",
