    "the r - process is a nucleosynthesis process to produce elements heavier than iron(@xcite ) .",
    "they occupy nearly half of the massive nuclear species , and show typical abundance peaks around nuclear masses a=80 , 130 and 195 , whose neutron numbers are slightly smaller than the magic numbers n=50 , 82 and 126 , respectively .",
    "this fact suggests that the r - process elements have completely different origin from the s - process elements whose abundance peaks are located just on the neutron magic numbers .",
    "the r - process elements are presumed to be produced in an explosive environment with short time scale and high entropy , where intensive flux of free neutrons are absorbed by seed elements successively to form the nuclear reaction flow on extremely unstable nuclei in neutron - rich side .",
    "recent progress in the studies of nuclear physics of unstable nuclei has made it possible to simulate the r - process nucleosynthesis by the use of accumulated knowledge on nuclear masses and beta half - lives of several critical radioactive elements .",
    "the studies of r - process elements make another impact on the cosmic age problem , that is the age of the universe to be known from cosmological constants and the age of the oldest globular cluster conflict with each other . a typical r - process element , thorium , has been detected recently in very metal - deficient stars , providing independent method to estimate the age of the milky way galaxy(@xcite ) . since thorium has half - life of 14 gyr , the observed abundance relative to the other stable elements is used as a chronometer dating the age of the galaxy .",
    "to study the origin of the r - process elements is thus important and even critical in cosmology and astronomy of galactic chemical evolution as well as nuclear physics of unstable nuclei .",
    "unfortunately , however , astrophysical site of the r - process nucleosynthesis has been poorly known , although several candidate sites are proposed and being investigated theoretically .    neutrino - driven wind , which is our object to study in this article , is thought to be one of the most promising candidates for the r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is generally believed that a neutron star is formed as the remnant of gravitational core collapse of type ii , ib or ic supernovae .",
    "the hot neutron star just born releases most of its energy as neutrinos during kelvin - helmholtz cooling phase , and these neutrino drive matter outflow from the surface .",
    "this outflow is called neutrino - driven wind .",
    "many theoretical studies of neutrino - driven wind followed the successful detection of energetic neutrinos from sn1987a , which raised the possibility of finding the r - process nucleosynthesis in this wind .",
    "although there are several numerical simulations of the neutrino - driven wind , results are very different from one another , depending on models and methods adopted in literature ( @xcite ) . a benchmark study of numerical simulation by wilson and his collaborators ( @xcite ) can successfully explain the solar system r - process abundances , but the others ( @xcite ) can not reproduce their result .",
    "qian and woosley ( 1996 ) tried to work out this discrepancy using approximate methods to solve the spherically symmetric , steady state flow in the newtonian framework .",
    "they could not find suitable condition for the r - process nucleosynthesis , and they suggested in a post - newtonian calculation that general relativistic effects may improve thermodynamic condition for the r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "cardall and fuller ( 1997 ) adopted similar approximate methods in general relativistic framework and obtained short dynamic time scale of the expansion and large entropy , which is in reasonable agreement with the result in post - newtonian approximation adopted by qian and woosley ( 1996 ) .",
    "they did not remark quantitatively , however , what kind of specific effect among several general relativistic effects is responsible for this change .",
    "since the wind blows near the surface of the neutron star , it is needed to study expansion dynamics of neutrino - driven wind in general relativity .",
    "the first purpose of this paper is to quantitatively make clear the effects of general relativity by adopting fully general relativistic framework .",
    "although we assume only spherical steady - state flow of the neutrino - driven wind , we do not adopt approximate methods as in several previous studies .",
    "we try to extract as general properties as possible of the wind in manners independent of supernova models so that they are to be compared with expansion of different object like accretion disk of binary neutron star merger ( @xcite ) or sub - critical small mass neutron star ( @xcite ) , which is induced by intense neutrino burst .",
    "the second purpose is to look for suitable conditions for the r - process .",
    "there are key quantities in order to explain the solar system r - process abundances .",
    "they are the mass outflow rate , @xmath3 , the dynamic time scale of the expansion , @xmath4 , the entropy , @xmath5 , and the electron fraction , @xmath6 .",
    "the third purpose of this paper is to make clear how these thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities affect the r - process nucleosynthesis by carrying out the nucleosynthesis calculation numerically .    in the next section",
    "we explain our theoretical models of neutrino - driven wind .",
    "we introduce basic equations to describe the dynamics of the wind in the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "boundary conditions and adopted parameters for solving these equations are presented in this section .",
    "numerical results are shown in section 3 , where the effects of general relativity are studied in detail .",
    "we also investigate the dependence of the key physical quantities like @xmath7 and @xmath5 on the neutron star mass , radius , and neutrino luminosity in order to look for the conditions of the neutrino - driven wind which is suitable for the r - process nucleosynthesis . applying the result obtained in section 3 ,",
    "we carry out the nucleosynthesis calculation in section 4 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to confirm quantitatively that the r - process elements are produced successfully in the wind having very short dynamic time scale with relatively low entropy .",
    "we finally summarize the results of this paper and present further discussions and outlook in section 5 .",
    "type ii or ib supernova explosion is one of the complex hydrodynamic process which needs careful theoretical studies of the convection associated with shock propagation .",
    "the time of our interest , however , is the later phase after the core bounce , at which the shock has already passed away to reach a radius about 10000 km and continuous mass outflow is installed from the surface of the neutron star .",
    "recent three dimensional numerical simulation ( hillebrandt 1998 ) has indicated that the convection near the shock front does not grow as deep as that shown in two - dimensional numerical simulation and the hydrodynamic conditions behind the shock are more likely similar to those obtained in one - dimensional numerical simulation . since wilson s numerical simulation of sn1987a in woosley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) has shown that the neutrino - driven wind is adequately described by a steady state flow , we here adopt spherically symmetric and steady state wind , following the previous studies ( @xcite ) . according to his numerical simulation , the neutrino luminosity @xmath8 changes slowly from about @xmath9 ergs / s to below @xmath10 ergs / s during @xmath11 s of the kelvin - helmholtz cooling phase of the neutron star .",
    "the properties of the protoneutron star , _",
    "i.e. _ the mass @xmath12 and radius @xmath13 , also evolve slowly .",
    "we therefore take these quantities @xmath8 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 as input parameters in order to describe more rapid evolution of the neutrino - driven wind .",
    "the basic equations to describe the spherically symmetric and steady state winds in schwarzschild geometry are given by ( @xcite ) @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath3 is the mass outflow rate , @xmath17 is the distance from the center of the neutron star , @xmath18 is the baryon mass density , @xmath19 is the radial component of the four velocity , @xmath20 is total energy density , @xmath21 is the specific internal energy , @xmath22 is the pressure , @xmath12 is the mass of the neutron star , and @xmath23 is the net heating rate due to neutrino interactions with matter .",
    "we use the conventional units that the plank constant @xmath24 , the speed of light @xmath25 , the boltzmann constant @xmath26 , and gravitational constant @xmath27 , are taken to be unity . since the neutrino - driven wind blows from the surface of the hot protoneutron star at high temperature @xmath28 mev and also the physics of the wind is mostly determined at @xmath29 mev ( @xcite ) , the equations of state are approximately written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the temperature of the system , and @xmath32 is the nucleon rest mass . we have assumed that the material in the wind consists of photons , relativistic electrons and positrons , and non - relativistic free nucleons .",
    "the heating rate @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : gk3 ] ) through the interactions between neutrinos and material takes the key to understand the dynamics of the neutrino - driven wind .",
    "following bethe ( 1993 ) and qian and woosley ( 1994 ) , we take account of the following five neutrino processes ; neutrino and antineutrino absorption by free nucleons , neutrino and antineutrino scattering by electrons and positrons , and neutrino - antineutrino annihilation into electron - positron pair as the heating processes , and electron and positron capture by free nucleons , and electron - positron annihilation into neutrino - antineutrino pair as the cooling processes .",
    "we assume that neutrinos are emitted isotropically from the surface of the neutron star at the radius @xmath13 , which proves to be a good approximation in recent numerical studies of the neutrino transfer ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", therefore , we make an assumption that the neutrinosphere radius is equal to the protoneutron star radius @xmath33 .",
    "since the neutrino trajectory is bent in the schwarzschild geometry , the material in the wind sees neutrinos within the solid angle subtended by the neutrinosphere which is greater than the solid angle in the newtonian geometry at the same coordinate radius . the bending effect of the neutrino trajectory increases the heating rate compared to newtonian case",
    "we have to take account of the redshift effect on the neutrino energy , too , which tends to decrease the heating rate .",

    "we also define the redshift factor @xmath52 in the schwarzschild geometry , which is unity in the newtonian geometry .",
    "we will discuss the effects of these general relativistic correction factors in the next section .",

    "we assume that the wind starts from the surface of the protoneutron star at the radius @xmath72 and the temperature @xmath73 . near the neutrinosphere and the neutron star surface , both heating ( mostly @xmath67 ) and cooling ( mostly @xmath68 ) processes almost balance with each other due to very efficient neutrino interactions with material .",
    "the system is thus in kinetic equilibrium ( barrows and mazurek 1982 ) at high temperature and high density .",

    "these figures indicate that both velocity and temperature profiles are very sensitive to the adopted @xmath3 corresponding to different boundary conditions at r = 10000 km",
    ". however , the entropies are more or less similar to one another , while exhibiting very different dynamic timescales .    although finding an appropriate boundary condition is not easy , it is one of preferable manners to match the condition obtained in numerical simulations of the supernova explosion .",
    "we studied one of the successful simulations of 20@xmath91 supernova explosion assuming @xmath93 ( @xcite ) .",
    "extensive studies of the r - process ( @xcite ) are based on his supernova model .",

    "it is to be noted that for successful r - process ( @xcite ) the temperature has to decrease gradually down to around 0.1 mev at the external region .",
    "this will be discussed in later sections . as displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and  [ fig1](b ) , our calculation denoted by `` 3 '' meets with this imposed boundary condition .",
    "although it may not be necessarily clear , we can adopt the same boundary condition for different neutron star masses which we study in this article , expecting that the physics continuously changes and also aiming at comparing the results with one another which arise from the same boundary condition . even in the case of massive neutron star having m = 2.0@xmath91 , as displayed in figs . [ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) , we can still find a solution denoted by `` 1 '' which satisfies the same outer boundary condition . although we fortunately found a solution with reasonable value of @xmath3 , careful studies of the numerical simulation in the case of massive neutron stars are highly desirable in order to find better boundary condition .",
    "let us discuss how our adopted outer boundary condition is not unresonable .",
    "we are interested in the times @xmath82 when the neutrino - driven wind becomes quasi steady state flow between the neutrinosphere and the shock front .",
    "intense flux of neutrinos from the hot proto - neutron star have already interacted efficiently with radiation and relativistic electron - positron pairs at high temperature .",
    "thus we have @xmath97 , where @xmath31 and @xmath98 are respectively the photon and neutrino temperatures . in this stage , the gain radius @xmath99 ( @xcite ) at which the neutrino heating and cooling balance with each other is very close to the neutrinosphere .",
    "since we make an approximation that the neutrinosphere and the neutron star surface is close enough , we here assume that the gain radius is also the same , i.e. @xmath100 . on these conditions we can estimate the mass outflow rate @xmath3 by considering the energy deposition to the gas from the main processes of neutrino capture on nucleons ( [ eqn : mib ] ) and ( [ eqn : plb ] ) .",
    "following the discussion by woosley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , the rate of energy deposition in the gas above the neutrinosphere is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the optical depth for the processes ( [ eqn : mib ] ) and ( [ eqn : plb ] ) and is given in terms of the opacity @xmath103 and the pressure scale height @xmath104 by , @xmath105 note that @xmath106 and @xmath107 . in order to obtain this expression , we have already used an approximate opacity ( @xcite ) @xmath108 and the pressure scale height in radiation dominated domain which is written as , @xmath109 where the subscripts on @xmath110 and @xmath111 indicate cgs multipliers in units of @xmath112 .",
    "the energy deposition eq.([eqn : edot ] ) is mostly used for lifting the matter out of the gravitational well of the neutron star .",
    "thus , inserting eq.([eqn : optd ] ) into eq.([eqn : edot ] ) and using the relation @xmath113 = @xmath114 , the mass outflow rate @xmath3 is approximately given by @xmath115 our mass outflow rate @xmath3 obtained from the imposed boundary condition of a temperature 0.1 mev at 10,000 km is in reasonable agreement with the estimate using this eq .",
    "( [ eqn : m ] ) within a factor of five for @xmath116 .",
    "when the material of the wind is on the surface of the neutron star and neutrinosphere , thermodynamic quantities still reflect the effects of neutralization and the electron fraction @xmath44 remains as low as @xmath117 .",
    "once the wind leaves surface after the core bounce , electron number density decreases abruptly and the chemical equilibrium among leptons is determined by the balance between the two processes ( [ eqn : mib ] ) and ( [ eqn : plb ] ) due to intense neutrino fluxes , shifting @xmath44 to @xmath118 .",
    "interesting phase starts when the temperature falls to @xmath119 k , for our purpose of studying the physical condition of the neutrino - driven wind that is suitable for the r - process nucleosynthesis . at this temperature",
    "the material is still in the nse , and the baryon numbers are carried by only free protons and neutrons .",

    "electron antineutrino has a harder spectrum than electron neutrino , as evident from their energy moments @xmath120 mev @xmath121 mev .",
    "thus , the material is slightly shifted to neutron - rich . assuming weak equilibrium , this situation is approximately described by @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the reaction rates for the processes ( [ eqn : mib ] ) and ( [ eqn : plb ] ) , respectively , and @xmath125 is the neutron - proton mass difference ( @xcite ) . in our parameter",

    "are insensitive to @xmath44 , we set @xmath131 for numerical simplicity .",
    "one of the most important hydrodynamic quantity , that characterizes the expansion dynamics of the neutrino - driven wind , is the dynamic time scale @xmath132 which is the duration time of the @xmath2-process .",
    "when the temperature falls below @xmath133 k , the nse favors a composition of alpha - particles and neutrons .",
    "as the temperature drops further below about @xmath134 k ( @xmath135 mev ) , the system falls out of the nse and the @xmath2-process starts accumulating some amount of seed elements until the charged particle reactions freeze out at @xmath136 mev @xmath137 mev . introducing a time variable of the wind moving away from the distance @xmath138 to outer distance @xmath139 @xmath140 and setting @xmath141 and @xmath142 , we can define the dynamic time scale @xmath132 by @xmath143    the second important hydrodynamic quantity , that affects strongly the r - process nucleosynthesis which occurs at later times when the temperature cools below @xmath144 mev , is the entropy per baryon , defined by @xmath145 where @xmath23 is the total net heating rate ( [ eqn : qtot ] ) . as @xmath146 assuming the radiation dominance , high entropy and high temperature characterizes a system with many photons and low baryon number density .",
    "since high entropy favors also a large fraction of free nucleons in the limit of the nse , it is expected to be an ideal condition for making high neutron - to - seed abundance ratio .",
    "therefore , the high entropy at the beginning of the @xmath2-process is presumed to be desirable for successful r - process .",

    "although higher entropy is favorable for making enough neutrons in the neutrino - driven wind , shorter dynamic time scale also is in favor of the r - process .",

    "since the dynamic time scale @xmath132 is defined as the duration of @xmath2-process in which the temperature of the wind cools from @xmath205 mev to @xmath212 mev , faster cooling is likely to result in shorter @xmath132 .",

    "for the reasons discussed below two eqs .",

    "let us briefly discuss how the system makes a complicated response to the change in @xmath180 , @xmath179 and @xmath181 .",
    "when the temperature decreases rapidly at @xmath218 km , the major cooling process of the @xmath219 capture by free nucleons , @xmath68 , is suppressed because this cooling rate has rather strong temperature dependence , @xmath220 . in schwarzschild geometry",
    "this suppression partially offsets the decrease in @xmath67 due to the neutrino redshift effect , though being independent of temperature of the wind .",
    "another heating source @xmath69 due to neutrino - electron scattering also plays a role in the change of entropy .",
    "since @xmath69 depends on the baryon density as well as temperature @xmath221 , if the system has a correlated response to decrease @xmath210 strongly with decreasing temperature , then this might eventually work for the partial increase in entropy .",
    "however , in reality , actual response arises from more complicated machanism because @xmath222 s should depend on the solution of dynamic equations ( 1)-(3 ) self - consistently on adopted proper boundary conditions and input parameters through the relation @xmath223 , @xmath220 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , and @xmath226 .",
    "the neutrino - driven wind is a highly non - linear system .",
    "most of the previous studies of the neutrino - driven wind have been concentrated on sn1987a , and the parameter set in the theoretical calculations was almost exclusive .",
    "we here expand our parameter region of the neutron star mass @xmath12 , radius @xmath13 , and neutrino luminosity @xmath8 , and investigate widely the dependence of key quantities , @xmath132 and @xmath5 , on these three parameters .",

    "however , absolute value of ( [ eqn : qwt])is about half that of the exact solution in the newtonian case .",

    "although kppeler et al . obtained these abundances as s - process subtractions from the observed meteoritic abundances  ( @xcite ) for the mass region @xmath363 , the inferred yields and error bars for @xmath364 , and 209 are subject to still uncertain s - process contribution .",
    "we did not show these heavy elements @xmath365 in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "our single wind model reproduces observed abundance peaks around @xmath366 and @xmath367 and the rare earth element region between these two peaks .",
    "however , there are several requirements to the wind model in order to better fit the details of the solar system r - process abundances in the mass region @xmath368 .",
    "the first unsatisfactory feature in our model calculation is that the two peaks are shifted upward by @xmath369 mass unit , although overall positions and peaks are in good agreement with the solar system data .",
    "this is a common problem in all theoretical calculations of the r - process nucleosynthesis ( @xcite ) .",
    "the shift of the peak around @xmath370 is slightly larger than that around at @xmath371 , which may be attributed to a strong neutron exposure as represented by @xmath360 in our model calculation .",
    "the second feature is that the rare earth element region shows broad abundance hill , but its peak position @xmath372 in the data is not explained in our calculation .",
    "it was pointed out by surman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that the abundance structure in this mass region is sensitive to a subtle interplay of nuclear deformation and beta decay just prior to the freeze - out of the r - process .",
    "more careful studies of these nuclear effects and the dynamics of the r - process nucleosynthesis are desirable .",
    "the third failure in the model calculation is the depletion around @xmath373 , which is also another serious problem encountered commonly by all previous theoretical calculations .",
    "this deficiency is thought to be made by too fast runaway of the neutron - capture reaction flow in this mass region .",
    "this is due to too strong shell effects of the @xmath374 neutron shell closure , suggesting an incomplete nuclear mass extrapolations to the nuclei with @xmath375 and @xmath376 which correspond to the depleted abundance mass region @xmath377 .",
    "it is an interesting suggestion  among many others ( @xcite ) that an artificial smoothing of extrapolated zigzag structure of nuclear masses could fill the abundance dip around @xmath378 .",
    "this suggestion sheds light on the improvement of mass formula .",
    "let us repeat it again that an overall success in the present r - process nucleosynthesis calculation , except for several unsatisfactory fine features mentioned above , is only for heavier mass elements @xmath379 including the second @xmath380 and the third @xmath327 peaks .",
    "when one looks at disagreement of the abundance yields around the first @xmath381 peak , relative to those at the third peak , between our calculated result and the solar system r - process abundances , it is clear that a single wind model is unable to reproduce all three r - process abundance peaks .",
    "the first peak elements should be produced on different conditions with lower neutron - to - seed ratio and higher neutrino flux .",
    "it has already been pointed out by several authors ( @xcite ) that even the r - process nucleosynthesis needs different neutron exposures similarly to the s - process nucleosynthesis in order to understand the solar system r - process abundance distribution . in a single event of supernova explosion",
    ", there are several different hydrodynamic conditions in different mass shells of the neutrino - driven wind ( @xcite ) , which may produce the first peak elements .",
    "different progenitor mass supernova or the event like an exploding accretion disk of neutron - star merger might contribute to the production of the r - process elements .",
    "consideration of these possibilities is beyond our scope in the present paper .",
    "we did not include the effects of neutrino absorption and scattering during the nucleosynthesis process in the present calculation .",
    "this is because these effects do not change drastically the final r - process yields as far as the dynamic expansion time scale @xmath382 is very short . using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tnu ] ) , we can estimate the specific collision time for neutrino - nucleus interaction @xmath383 where the input parameters are set equal to @xmath384 mev , and @xmath284 @xmath285 .",
    "note that @xmath385 s is the specific neutrino collision time at @xmath386 km where the temperature of the wind becomes @xmath205 mev at the beginning of the @xmath2-process , and @xmath387 s for @xmath388 km and @xmath212 mev at the beginning of the r - process .",
    "these @xmath102 values are larger than @xmath308 s that stands for the duration of the @xmath2-process by definition .",
    "therefore , the neutrino process does not disturb the hydrodynamic condition of the rapid expansion during the @xmath2-process .",
    "it is to be noted , however , that the neutrino process virtually makes the strong effect on the r - process for the winds of slow expansion .",
    "we have numerically examined woosley s",
    "model  ( 1994 ) of trajectory 40 to find @xmath389 s. meyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also used @xmath390 s in their simplified fluid trajectory to see the neutrino - capture effects .",
    "this dynamic time scale @xmath389 s is larger than or comparable to the specific neutrino collision time @xmath102 in eq.([eqn:34 ] ) . in such a slow expansion the neutrino absorption by neutron  ( [ eqn : mib ] ) proceeds to make a new proton in the @xmath2-process .",
    "this proton is quickly interconverted into alpha - particle in the following reaction chain , @xmath391 t which is followed by t@xmath392he@xmath393he and t@xmath394he , and contributes to the production of seed elements . these radiative capture reactions and nuclear reactions are much faster than the weak process ( [ eqn : plb ] ) on newly produced proton from the process ( [ eqn : mib ] ) .",
    "the net effect of these neutrino processes , therefore , is to decrease the neutron number density and increase the seed abundance , which leads to extremely low @xmath355 ratio . as a result ,",
    "even the second abundance @xmath380 peak of the r - process elements disappears , as reported in literature ( @xcite ) .",
    "details on the neutrino process will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we have assumed that electrons and positrons are fully relativistic throughout the nucleosynthesis process .",
    "however , the total entropy of the system may change at the temperature @xmath395 where electrons and positrons tend to behave as non - relativistic particles .",
    "this might affect the nucleosynthesis although it does not affect significantly the dynamics near the protoneutron star .",
    "we should correct this assumption in the future papers .",
    "finally , let us refer to massive neutron star .",
    "large dispersion in heavy element abundance of halo stars has recently been observed .",
    "ishimaru and wanajo ( 1999 ) have shown in their galactic chemical evolution model that if r - process nucleosynthesis occurs in either massive supernovae @xmath396 or small mass supernovae @xmath397 , where these masses are for the progenitors , the observed large dispersion can be well explained theoretically .",
    "in addition , sn1994w and sn1997d are presumed to be due to 25 @xmath398 massive progenitors because of very low @xmath399ni abundance in the ejecta ( @xcite ) .",
    "these massive supernova are known to have massive iron core @xmath400 and leave massive remnant ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is critical for the r - process nucleosynthesis whether the remnant is neutron star or black hole .",
    "recent theoretical studies of the eos of neutron star matter , which is based on relativistic mean field theory , set upper limit of the neutron star mass at 2.2 @xmath91 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we studied the general relativistic effects on neutrino - driven wind which is presumed to be the most promising site for the r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "we assumed the spherically symmetric and steady state flow of the wind . in solving the basic equations for relativistic fluid in schwarzschild geometry",
    ", we did not take approximate method as adopted in several previous studies .",
    "we tried to extract generic properties of the wind in manners independent of supernova models or neutron - star cooling models .",
    "the general relativistic effects introduce several corrections to the equations of motion of the fluid and also to the formulae of neutrino heating rate due to the redshift and bending of neutrino trajectory .",
    "we found that these corrections increase entropy and decrease dynamic time scale of the expanding neutrino - driven wind from those in the newtonian case .",
    "the most important corrections among them proves to be the correction to the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "both temperature and density of the relativistic wind decrease more rapidly than the newtonian wind as the distance increases without remarkable change of the velocity at @xmath401 km , where the neutrino - heating takes place efficiently .",
    "the lower the temperature and density are , the larger the net heating rate is .",
    "this is the main reason why the entropy in the relativistic case is larger than the newtonian case .",
    "we also looked for suitable environmental condition for the r - process nucleosynthesis in general relativistic framework .",
    "we studied first the differences and similarities between relativistic and newtonian winds in numerical calculations , and then tried to interpret their behavior by expressing gradients of the temperature , velocity and density of the system analytically under the reasonable approximations .",
    "we extensively studied the key quantities for the nucleosynthesis , _",
    "i.e. _ the entropy @xmath5 and the dynamic time scale @xmath7 of the expanding neutrino - driven wind , and their dependence on the protoneutron star mass , radius , and neutrino luminosity .",
    "we found that more massive or equivalently more compact neutron star tends to produce explosive neutrino - driven wind of shorter dynamic time scale , which is completely different from the result of the previous studies in the newtonian case which adopted approximation methods .",
    "we also found that the entropy becomes larger as the neutron star mass becomes larger .",
    "since the larger luminosity makes the dynamic time scale shorter , the large neutrino luminosity is desirable as far as it is less than @xmath9ergs / sec .",
    "if it exceeds @xmath9 ergs / sec , only the mass outflow rate becomes large and the flow can not cool down to @xmath402 by the shock front @xmath403 km . as the result ,",
    "the time scale becomes too long , which is not favorable to the r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "although we could not find a model which produces very large entropy @xmath404 400 as suggested by woosley et al.(1994 ) , it does not mean that the r - process does not occur in the neutrino - driven wind .",
    "we compared our results with hoffman s condition and found that the short dynamic time scale @xmath405ms , with @xmath406 and @xmath251 ergs / sec , is one of the most preferable condition for producing r - process elements around the third peak ( @xmath407 ) . in order to confirm this",
    ", we carried out numerical calculations of the r - process nucleosynthesis upon this condition by using fully implicit single network code which takes account of more than @xmath304 isotopes and their associated nuclear reactions in large network .",
    "we found that the r - process elements around @xmath407 and even the heavier elements like thorium can be produced in this wind , although it has low entropy @xmath408 .",
    "the short dynamic time scale @xmath405 ms was found to play the role so that the few seed nuclei are produced with plenty of free neutrons left over at the beginning of the r - process .",
    "for this reason the resultant neutron - to - seed ratio , @xmath409 , in high enough even with low entropy and leads to appreciable production of r - process elements around the second@xmath380 and third @xmath327 abundance peaks and even the hill of rare earth elements between the peaks .",
    "note that the energy release by the interconversion of nucleons into @xmath2-particles at @xmath410 mev produces an additional entropy about @xmath411 .",
    "this was not included in our present calculation .",
    "we can make note that , taking account of this increase , the r - process could occur in the neutrino - driven wind from hot neutron star whose mass is smaller than 2.0@xmath412 .",
    "one might think that short @xmath7 brings deficiency of neutrino heating and that the wind may not blow .",
    "it is not true because the mass elements in the wind are heated by energetic neutrinos most efficiently at @xmath413 , while the expansion time scale @xmath7 is the time for the temperature to decrease from @xmath410 mev to 0.2 mev at larger radii .",
    "the duration of time for the mass elements to reach 30 km after leaving neutron star surface is longer than @xmath7 .",
    "there is enough time for the system to be heated by neutrinos even for @xmath7 as low as @xmath414 ms .",
    "we did not include neutrino - capture reactions that may change @xmath44 during the nucleosynthesis process .",
    "since the initial electron fraction was taken to be relatively high @xmath415 , there is a possibility that the final nucleosynthesis yields in neutrino - driven wind may be modified by the change in @xmath44 during the @xmath2- and r - processes .",
    "however , this is expected to make a small modification in our present expansion model with short dynamic time scale because the typical time scale of neutrino interaction is longer than @xmath7 .",
    "we will report the details about the nucleosynthesis calculation including neutrino - capture reactions in forthcoming papers .",
    "it was found that the entropy decreases with increasing neutrino luminosity .",
    "this fact suggests that one can not obtain large entropy by merely making the heating rate large . the cooling rate ,",
    "on the other hand , does not depend on the neutrino luminosity . in the present studies we included two cooling mechanisms of the @xmath416 capture by free nucleons and the @xmath416 pair annihilation .",
    "as for the cooling rate due to the @xmath416 pair annihilation , only the contribution from pair - neutrino process is usually taken into consideration , as in the present calculation . however , there are many other processes which can contribute to the total cooling rate .",
    "they are the photo - neutrino process , the plasma - neutrino process , the bremsstrahlung - neutrino process and the recombination - neutrino process ( @xcite ) . indeed ,",
    "if we double our adopted cooling rate artificially , we can obtain larger entropy .",
    "details on the numerical studies of the cooling rate are reported elsewhere .",
    "the radial dependence of the heating rate is also important ( @xcite ) .",
    "since both heating and cooling processes are critical to determine the entropy , more investigation on the neutrino process is desirable .",
    "there are other effects which have not been included in the present study .",
    "they are , for example , the mass accretion onto the neutron star , the time variation of the neutrino luminosity , convection and mixing of materials , and rotation or other dynamic process which break spherical symmetry of the system .",
    "these probably important effects may make several modifications to the present result .",
    "however , we believe that our main conclusion that there is a possibility of finding the r - process nucleosynthesis in an environment of relatively small entropy and short dynamic time scale is still valid . we conclude that the neutrino - driven wind is a promising astrophysical site for the successful r - process nucleosynthesis .",
