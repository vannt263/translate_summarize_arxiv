    "the formation of a plasma of quarks and gluons has been a long - standing goal of contemporary nuclear science for a few decades now , and it is fair to write that this goal has been attained with the advent of rhic ( the relativistic heavy ion collider ) at brookhaven national laboratory . indeed",
    ", new physics has been discovered by the experimental program associated with this facility which now enters an exciting phase of characterization and of precision physics . in this",
    "context , real and virtual photons are penetrating probes as they suffer essentially no final state interaction .",
    "they constitute observables that are complementary to other hard probes , such as qcd jets .",
    "we report here on calculations of jets and real photons at high @xmath0 , and of photon - triggered hadron distributions in relativistic nuclear collisions at rhic .",
    "arguably , one of the most sensational observations at rhic has been the dramatic suppression of high @xmath0 hadrons in central a+a collisions , compared with those measured in p+p events ( multiplied by the number of binary collisions in a nucleus - nucleus event ) .",
    "this is quantified by the nuclear modification factor ( in a given centrality range , which is correlated with the impact parameter , @xmath1 ) : @xmath2 $ ] . at high transverse momentum ,",
    "hadrons mostly originate from the fragmentation of qcd jets .",
    "however , before they escape the medium , hard partons will interact with the thermal medium . in the finite - temperature field theory approach",
    "utilized here @xcite the evolution of the parton distribution function @xmath3 can be modeled by a set of coupled fokker - planck equations generically written as @xmath4\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the first term , a parton @xmath5 of energy @xmath6 is born from a parent @xmath7 of energy @xmath8 . in the integral @xmath9 , which takes care of both energy loss and gain from the thermal medium .",
    "the sum runs over different parton species and @xmath10 is the transition rate for the partonic process @xmath11 , calculated with the techniques of amy @xcite .",
    "the hard partons may loose or gain energy by the radiation of gluons , or by elastic collisions with the hot medium .",
    "the relative importance of these two mechanisms is shown in figure [ rad - elastic ] .",
    "= 400 mev .",
    "the number distribution at various times is plotted as a function of the energy .",
    "the initial state is a delta function at e = 16 gev , and each vertical line corresponds to the average energy at the specified time .",
    "the calculation is from ref .",
    "see however ref .",
    "@xcite for an update bearing some qualitative differences.,width=264 ]",
    "there are many sources that produce photons in relativistic nuclear collisions , and they can be classified in two categories : on whether or not they depend on the temperature of the medium .",
    "prompt photons , emitted during the very first instants of a nuclear collision , will represent an important background in the context of the search for signals of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "those in turn can be decomposed in two distinct sources : direct and fragmentation photons @xcite .",
    "the direct photons are produced from the early hard collisions between partons in the nucleons of the projectile and target nuclei . at leading order in the strong coupling ,",
    "the photon production proceeds via quark - antiquark annihilation ( @xmath13 ) and qcd compton scattering ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "there is also a contribution to real photon from fragmenting hard qcd jets .",
    "this component is well - known for the case of , say , pp collisions @xcite , but in nucleus - nucleus collisions the jet can propagate through the quark - gluon plasma , interact , and thus lose energy prior to its fragmentation .",
    "this introduces a non - trivial path and angle - dependence into the process of calculating the yield of photons produced through jet fragmentation @xcite .",
    "the most obvious source that requires a finite temperature treatment is that of photon production through the interaction of thermal components either from the quark - gluon plasma side of the qcd phase diagram , or from the hadrons in the confined sector .",
    "emission rates for those have been established @xcite . however , at hight @xmath16 thermal photons will not play an important role but it is nevertheless important to have their emission rate under control .",
    "another thermal component is that of jet - medium photons @xcite .",
    "these photons , owing to phase space considerations , will have the energy of the initial hard particle and their measurement is of primary importance as they represent an independent confirmation of the conditions for jet quenching @xcite .",
    "similary , a jet propagating in the hot and dense medium will produce electromagnetic radiation through bremsstrahlung .",
    "finally , the jet fragmentation photons will now acquire a temperature dependence , through the energy loss mechanism and the coupling to the thermal medium .",
    "note that all of the sources discussed here and above exists for dileptons , with appropriate adjustments @xcite .",
    "an importance milestone in such calculations is to first verify the correctness of photon spectra in p+p collisions , and then of those measured in nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "importantly , the hydrodynamic evolution used here and in these cited works also yields a set of hadronic observables consistent with measurements .",
    "going beyond one - body observables is important , as correlation studies will impose more stringent requirements on the underlying physics and might therefore highlight some theoretical differences that might otherwise have remain hidden . in this context ,",
    "additional insight on jet quenching should be gained by triggering on a `` near side '' photon and measuring the distribution of charged hadrons in the opposite direction @xcite .        for this purpose ,",
    "a useful variable is the photon - triggered fragmentation function : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the yield per trigger : the momentum distribution of produced hadrons on the away side , given a trigger photon of momentum @xmath20 on the near side .",
    "a calculation of @xmath21 is shown in figure [ d_aa ] .",
    "having a complete theory enables a breakdown of the contribution into its different components : at small @xmath22 , roughly half the away - side hadrons are tagged by direct photons , while at higher values of @xmath22 a large amount of hadrons on the opposite side come from jets tagged by jet - medium photons and fragmentation photons .",
    "the agreement with the data is satisfying , and clearly the methods outlined here have great potential for future analyses as different parts of the available phase space will reveal different sources of photons .",
    "finally , as the lhc will produce a plethora of jet events , the techniques briefly alluded to here will also be of great use in analyses there .",
