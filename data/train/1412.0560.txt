    "as we know , the universe is expanding and this expanding is undergoing an accelerating phase .",
    "this issue discovered in type ia supernova @xcite , associated with large scale structure @xcite and cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the accelerated expansion of the universe is created from a mysterious energy called dark energy , which is about two thirds the total energy of universe . by using the einstein field equation , the accelerated expansion described by a small positive cosmological constant .",
    "also this discovery demonstrates that geometry of the universe is very close to flat space @xcite .",
    "various candidates have been introduced to describe dark energy scenario , so that the universe dominates with a perfect fluid by a negative pressure and the eos parameter which is less than @xmath4 , the so - called phantom phase .",
    "we can introduce some of these models such as the cosmological constant @xcite , the scalar fields ( including quintessence , @xmath5-essence , phantom , tachyon , etc ) @xcite , the vector field @xcite , holographic @xcite , interacting model @xcite and braneworld models @xcite .    moreover , there are some other methods to describe the universe accelerated expansion . one of these theories is modified gravity theories that from the physical point of view , this prevents the complexities of the previous models especially the complicated computation of numerical solutions .",
    "another benefit of the modified gravity theories is consistent with recent observations for late accelerating universe and dark energy .",
    "some of these modified gravity theories can directly be achieved by replacing the ricci scalar @xmath6 by @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 with an arbitrary function in the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "these theories are introduced as @xmath10 gravity @xcite , @xmath8 gravity @xcite and @xmath9 gravity @xcite which respectively an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath6 , the torsion scalar @xmath11 and the gauss - bonnet term @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , we can tell that modified gravitational theories are a generalization of general relativity .",
    "we also note that @xmath8 gravity is a generalized version of teleparallel gravity originally proposed by einstein @xcite , he had tried to redefine the unification of gravity and electromagnetism on the mathematical structure of distant parallelism by introducing of a tetrad or vierbein field , the so - called teleparallelism .",
    "thus , instead of using the levi - civita connection in the framework of general relativity , we use the weitzenbck connection in teleparallelism . in that case , the four - dimensional space - time manifold must be a parallelizable manifold @xcite .    in this paper , we will explain the late time accelerated expansion of the universe with the unification of @xmath7 and @xmath13 gravity theories as @xmath0 gravity which one is an arbitrary function of curvature scalar @xmath6 and torsion scalar @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the existence of both scalars @xmath6 and @xmath11 into @xmath0 gravity is effective on only geometry of universe no on matter source .",
    "this means that universe is included the effects of curvature and torsion .",
    "as we discussed , the acceleration can be consequence of the dark energy influence that this leads to some other models called chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "chaplygin gas is a fluid with negative pressure that begins to dominate the matter content and , at the end , the process of structure formation is driven by cold dark matter without affecting the previous history of the universe .",
    "this kind of chaplygin gas cosmology has an interesting connection to string theory via the nambu - goto action for a d - brane moving in a @xmath14-dimensional space - time , feature than can be regarded to the tachyonic panorama @xcite .",
    "the main objective of this paper is that we will consider the @xmath0 gravity model as a source of dark energy .",
    "therefore , we intend to investigate the interacting model between @xmath0 gravity and modified chaplygin gas with this motivation that we can describe the accelerated expansion of the universe .    the paper is organized as follows :    in sec . [ s2 ] , we review @xmath0 gravity model and obtain the friedmann equations by using the corresponding connections . in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] , we introduce the basic setup of the modified chaplygin gas , and then will interact @xmath0 gravity with modified chaplygin gas .",
    "thereinafter , total energy density and total pressure of universe will be written in the form of a combination of modified chaplygin gas and dark energy . in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] , we reconstruct the current model with a source of scalar field by quintessence model , and then the cosmological parameters will be written in terms of redshift and @xmath2-folding number .",
    "also we investigate stability of the model and present corresponding graphs in terms of redshift and @xmath2-folding number . finally , a short summary is given in sec .",
    "the action of @xmath0 gravity theory coupled with matter is given by @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 , in which @xmath17 is the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the matter lagrangian .",
    "the @xmath0 is an arbitrary function of curvature scalar @xmath6 and torsion scalar @xmath11 .",
    "we note that curvature scalar represents gravity in general relativity , and torsion scalar represents gravity in teleparallel gravity by a different mathematical notations as levi - civita connection and wienzbck connection , respectively . despite this difference ,",
    "independently both theories have similar result for equivalent descriptions of gravitation .",
    "therefore , we consider a vierbein field @xmath20 with index @xmath21 running from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , which one is an orthonormal basis for the tangent space at each point @xmath24 of the manifold in wienzbck connection .",
    "then , we can relate vierbein field to the metric as @xmath25 in which the minkowski metric @xmath26 .",
    "we consider homogeneous and isotropic universe in the flat flrw metric in the following form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is scale factor , and one is the function of cosmic time .",
    "we can write the vierbein field in accordance with as follows @xmath29 now we intend to find the corresponding lagrangian of the action as @xmath30 in that case , we expand expression @xmath0 by maclaurin series , so that the lagrangian is simplicity yielded as @xmath31 where indices denote derivative with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath11 in corresponding locations , and the point denotes derivative with respect to cosmic time",
    ". the curvature and torsion scalars are find by    [ rt1 ] @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the hubble parameter , and , @xmath34 and @xmath35 be defined as the two arbitrary functions in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the ricci , antisymmetric and torsion tensors respectively , in the form    [ rst ] @xmath41    where the contortion tensor @xmath42 is @xmath43 by using the eq .",
    ", we can obtain the friedmann equations in the following form    [ rhop ] @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are total energy density and total pressure of an universe dominated with a perfect fluid , respectively .",
    "the continuity equation of the model becomes @xmath47 in this paper , we consider a simple particular model of @xmath0 gravity as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are constants .    now for solving the model ,",
    "we choose a power form for functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 as    [ uv1 ] @xmath53    to substitute eqs . into eqs .",
    ", the friedmann equations are rewritten by    [ rho2 ] @xmath54",
    "one of the recent cosmological models which is based on the use of exotic type of perfect fluid suggests that our universe filled with the chaplygin gas with the following equation of state @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a positive constant .",
    "the equation of state generalized as @xmath57 which is known as generalized chaplygin gas .",
    "therefore , modified chaplygin gas with the following equation of state introduced @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a positive constant , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the pressure and energy density in which @xmath62 .",
    "this model is more appropriate choice to have constant negative pressure at low energy density and high pressure at high energy density .",
    "the special case of @xmath63 is the best fitted value to describe evolution of the universe from radiation regime to the @xmath64 regime .",
    "also , the modified chaplygin gas has been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider the total energy density and pressure of universe as the combination of components of dark energy and chaplygin gas in the following form    [ rhoptot ] @xmath65    now , we take an energy flow between the dark energy and modified chaplygin gas , so the energy flow is introduced as an interaction between two components . in this way , the continuity equation be written to two separate continuity equations in the following form    [ rhopq ] @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the interaction term between the dark energy and modified chaplygin gas , that one be usually considered as : @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 in which @xmath71 is the coupling parameter or transfer strength @xcite .",
