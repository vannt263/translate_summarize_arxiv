    "a higgs boson has been discovered at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "current data show that its properties such as its mass , production cross sections times the decay branching ratios and the spin - parity are consistent with those of the higgs boson in the standard model ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "however , the whole structure of the higgs sector has not been clarified at all . since there is no principle to determine the structure of the higgs sector ,",
    "the sm higgs sector is the simplest but just one of the possibilities .",
    "there are many problems , which should be explained by new physics beyond the sm , such as the naturalness problem , the origin of tiny neutrino masses and mixings , the existence of dark matter , etc .",
    "various extensions of the sm considered to solve these problems often contain the extended higgs sector , where new higgs multiplets are added to the sm higgs sector .",
    "multi higgs models are constrained by the electroweak @xmath1 parameter significantly . the two higgs doublet model ( thdm )",
    "is the natural and minimal extension of the sm higgs sector , since multi higgs doublet models predict the @xmath1 parameter to be unity at the tree level  @xcite . in general",
    ", the thdm predicts the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) which is severely constrained by the experimental data .",
    "this problem may be solved by introducing a discrete @xmath2 symmetry under which the different parity is assigned to each doublet field  @xcite . under this symmetry ,",
    "each fermion couples with only one higgs doublet , and hence the fcnc is absent at the tree level .",
    "depending on the assignment of the @xmath2 parity to each fermion , there are four types of yukawa interactions in the thdm . among the four types of yukawa interactions , so - called type - ii and type - x  @xcite",
    "deserve many interests as an effective theory of the higgs sector in the new physics model .",
    "for example , the type - ii thdm is known to be the higgs sector in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm )  @xcite , where one higgs doublet couples with down - type quarks and charged leptons and the other with up - type quarks . on the other hand , the type - x thdm , in which one higgs doublet couples with quarks and the other with charged leptons , may be motivated by some sort of new physics models concerning phenomena relevant to leptons and higgs bosons , such as tiny neutrino masses  @xcite , the positron cosmic ray anomaly  @xcite , the fermi - lat gamma ray line data  @xcite , the muon anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite , etc .",
    "verification of the thdm by using the collider data and the flavor data has been an important task , while no positive evidence has been found so far .",
    "the results give constraints on the parameters in the thdm , depending on the type of the yukawa interactions  @xcite .",
    "some of them are not constrained so strongly because of the small couplings of additional higgs bosons with quarks , allowing a relatively light mass of extra higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "further studies will be continued at the upgraded lhc with @xmath3  tev , where the discovery of more heavier particles may be expected .",
    "on the other hand , evidences of the thdm can be probed through the measurement of the sm - like higgs boson , since the coupling constants of the sm - like higgs boson can deviate from those in the sm .",
    "this is quite a realistic situation , since the higgs couplings can be measured very precisely , a few percent level , at the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite",
    ". it may be problematic that it is not straightforward to identify the model of new physics from such measurements , since the effects are indirect and some models may bring the similar effects . to resolve this problem , one needs to combine measurements of various observables and perform fingerprinting of the models which predict different patterns of the deviations in the various observables .    in this paper , we focus on the determination of @xmath0 , the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the doublets in the thdms , by using future precision measurements of the sm - like higgs boson at linear colliders .",
    "so far , the methods to determine @xmath0 have been discussed using the heavy extra higgs bosons within the context of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "however , the methods using the heavy extra bosons must follow the discovery of them .",
    "thus , these are applicable to the cases with relatively small masses , where already strong constraints are obtained in some types of the thdm  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we propose a new method to determine @xmath0 , through the branching ratios of the sm - like higgs boson , which could be performed even when the discovery of extra higgs bosons is not accomplished .",
    "our method is applicable when there exists a deviation in the gauge couplings of the sm - like higgs boson . in the general thdm , the deviation can be larger than that in the mssm , since @xmath0 is independent of the masses of the extra higgs bosons .",
    "thus , it is meaningful to investigate the @xmath0 measurement in various situations in the masses of extra higgs bosons .",
    "we evaluate the uncertainties of the @xmath0 determination in our method in the general thdm , and compare them with those of the methods proposed previously .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a brief review on the thdm to specify the notation and define the parameters relevant in our study . in section iii ,",
    "three methods for the @xmath0 determination are introduced ; i ) the branching ratio measurement , ii ) the total width measurement of the extra higgs bosons , and iii ) the precision measurement of the decay branching ratios of the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "we apply these methods to the type - ii and type - x thdms .",
    "the simulation details are summarized in appendix  a. conclusion and discussion are given in section iv .",
    "in the thdm , the su(2 ) doublet scalar fields with a hypercharge @xmath4 are parametrized as @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "the mass eigenstates are defined by introducing the mixing angles , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as @xmath9 where @xmath8 satisfies @xmath10 . for simplicity , we assume cp conservation in the higgs sector . then , there are five physical higgs bosons , which are two cp - even states @xmath11 , one cp - odd state @xmath12 , and a pair of the charged states @xmath13 .",
    "the electroweak nambu - goldstone bosons , @xmath14 , are absorbed into the weak gauge bosons .",
    "for the details of the higgs potential in the thdm , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "gauge interactions of higgs bosons in the thdm are given by normalizing them with those in the sm as @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "thus , when @xmath17 , which is so - called `` the sm - like limit '' , @xmath18 has the same gauge interaction as the sm higgs boson .",
    "we note that the deviation from the sm - like limit is theoretically restricted for heavy @xmath19 and @xmath12 in the general thdm  @xcite .",
    "indeed , for @xmath20 with large @xmath0 , @xmath21 can be written as @xmath22 with @xmath23 being a coefficient of the quartic term in the potential .",
    "a large value of @xmath23 is constrained by requiring the validity of the perturbative calculation ( so - called unitarity bound )  @xcite .",
    "thus , the deviation from the sm - like limit can not be large for heavy @xmath19 and @xmath12 . under the @xmath2 symmetry",

    "therefore , @xmath19 and @xmath12 can be light enough to be produced at the ilc .",
    "if they are light , @xmath0 can be determined by the direct measurement of their properties at the ilc .",
    "we have compared the sensitivities to @xmath0 using these measurements and the @xmath18 decay .",

    "in addition to the methods previously proposed by using the extra higgs bosons , we have discussed the method which uses the precision measurement of the @xmath18 decay . we have found that @xmath0 can be determined very well in a wide range of @xmath0 values at the ilc by combining these methods .",

    "the jet is tagged as a @xmath146-jet , if the cluster contains one or three charged particles and the sum of @xmath145 of particles inside the @xmath147 cone is more than 95% of @xmath145 of the cluster .",
    "the jet which has @xmath148-hadrons in the decay history of its constituent particles is tagged as a @xmath148-jet with the probability of 65% . the other jet which has @xmath149-hadrons in the decay history of its constituent particles",
