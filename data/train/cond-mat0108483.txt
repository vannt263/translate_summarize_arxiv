    "a cuprate with a nearly undoped cuo@xmath0 plane shows high resistivity and antiferromagnetic order at low temperature , which is called a parent insulator of high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) . with doping , an insulator - metal transition ( imt )",
    "arises , and the system changes from the parent insulator to htsc . for imt ,",
    "the dielectric constant @xmath8 is of great importance in the sense that it provides a measure of localisation length in the insulator . in particular , @xmath8 for doped si divergingly increases with a critical exponent toward the imt @xcite .",
    "chen _ et al .",
    "_ first pointed out the importance of @xmath8 for the imt of htsc @xcite .",
    "they found that @xmath8 of la@xmath0cuo@xmath9 diverged only along the in - plane direction toward the imt , and stated that the imt of htsc was two - dimensional .",
    "however , their study was done only for la@xmath0cuo@xmath9 , in which a quasi - static stripe fluctuates in the cuo@xmath0 plane @xcite .",
    "since the stripe fluctuation is a kind of charge modulation and/or a charge disproportion , it might cause a large dielectric response .",
    "perhaps related to this , ( la , sr)@xmath0cuo@xmath9 shows structure phase transition @xcite , oxygen ordering @xcite and phase separation @xcite , which might also give a large dielectric response .",
    "thus it is necessary to study another class of htsc , which is far away from the stripe- or lattice - instability .",
    "we think that bi@xmath0sr@xmath0rcu@xmath0o@xmath3 ( bi-2212 ) is the best candidate .",
    "this class of htsc shows no structural phase transition below 300 k , and is expected to be away from the stripe instability .",
    "( the only exception is the zn - doped bi2212 of ref.@xcite . )",
    "we should also note that bi-2212 has only one equivalent cu site , unlike the cuo chain in yba@xmath0cu@xmath10o@xmath11 .",
    "we have studied the charge transport of the parent insulator of bi-2212 @xcite , and have found that their physics is as rich as the physics of htsc themselves . in this paper , we report on measurement and analysis of the dielectric constant of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0er@xmath1dy@xmath2cu@xmath0o@xmath3 single crystals along the out - of - plane direction .",
    "single crystals of bi-2212 were grown by self - flux method .",
    "the growth conditions and the sample characterisation were described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the prepared crystals of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0dy@xmath1er@xmath2cu@xmath0o@xmath3 ( @xmath12=0 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 and 1.0 ) were insulating , and the doping levels of the as - grown crystals were slightly different for different @xmath12 . an energy - dispersive x - ray ( edx ) analysis revealed that sr was slightly excessive , and the content was estimated to be bi@xmath13sr@xmath14r@xmath15cu@xmath0o@xmath16 ( within an experimental error of 10% ) .",
    "the r content @xmath17 was 1.0 for r = dy and 0.7 for r = er . thus a real composition would be something like bi@xmath0sr@xmath0dycu@xmath0o@xmath3 and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0(sr@xmath18er@xmath19)cu@xmath0o@xmath3 for r= dy and er , respectively .",
    "thus a solid solution between er and dy gives bi@xmath0sr@xmath0dy@xmath1(sr@xmath18er@xmath19)@xmath20cu@xmath0o@xmath3 , which enables us to finely tune the doping level from highly insulating ( @xmath12=0 ) to slightly doped level ( @xmath12=1 ) . instead of the real composition",
    ", we will call the prepared samples bi@xmath0sr@xmath0dy@xmath1er@xmath20cu@xmath0o@xmath3 as a matter of convenience . for a reference , a superconducting sample bi@xmath0sr@xmath0ca@xmath6pr@xmath7cu@xmath0o@xmath3 ( r = ca@xmath6pr@xmath7 ) was also prepared .",
    "figure [ f1](a ) shows the temperature dependence of the out - of - plane resistivity for the measured samples . reflecting that the carrier concentration increases with increasing er content",
    ", the magnitude systematically decreases with @xmath12 . for r",
    "= ca@xmath6pr@xmath7 , the superconducting transition is observed slightly below 80  k.    we estimated the hole concentration per cu ( @xmath21 ) from the room - temperature thermopower @xcite , and found @xmath21=0 , 0.01 , 0.015 , 0.03 , and 0.035 for @xmath12=0 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 , and 1.0 , respectively . for r",
    "= ca@xmath6pr@xmath7 , @xmath21 was estimated to be 0.14 ( underdoped region ) .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath21 was typically @xmath22 arising from the scattered data in ref.@xcite , within which the estimated @xmath21 is consistent with the @xmath21 estimated from the hall coefficient .",

    "et al_. @xcite a low contact resistance was realized by uniformly painting the silver paste ( dupont 6838 ) on both sides of the @xmath26-plane surface , followed by annealing at 873 k for 30 min .",
    "the contact resistance was 1 - 2 @xmath27 , which can be safely neglected by comparison with the sample resistance ( typically 100 @xmath27 ) . in order to make the sample resistance high",
    ", we cut the sample along the @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions as small as possible .",
    "for the most conducting sample of r = ca@xmath6pr@xmath7 , the dimension was 0.2@xmath300.2@xmath300.05 mm@xmath31 .",
    "figure [ f1](b ) shows a typical two - probe resistance for r = ca@xmath6pr@xmath7 .",
    "since the sample is superconducting , the resistivity rapidly decreases below 80 k , and the residual resistance is 6.6 @xmath27 that is the sum of the contact resistance and the probe resistance ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the sample resistance is 280 @xmath27 at 80 k , which indicates the contribution of the contact resistance is less than 1 % .",

    "previously we found that the frequency dependence of @xmath43 for @xmath44 is explained with the debye model of dielectric relaxation @xcite .",
    "although the relaxation behaviour may not be clearly seen in figure [ f2 ] , @xmath43 decreases with increasing frequency .",

    "@xcite measured anisotropic dielectric constant of single - crystal la@xmath0cuo@xmath46 , and found the relaxation behaviour along the c - axis direction . for other parent insulators , shi @xcite measured @xmath8 of polycrystalline samples of ( la , gd)@xmath0cuo@xmath46 , and mazzara _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured @xmath43 of single - crystal prba@xmath0cu@xmath10o@xmath11 .",
    "these materials also show a large @xmath8 with a relaxation behaviour , and we conclude that this is generic in the parent insulator of htsc .    it is quite difficult to accurately measure @xmath43 for a superconducting sample .",
    "an upturn above 10@xmath47 hz for r = ca@xmath6pr@xmath7 is an artifact due to an inductance contribution from the leads because of the small sample resistivity , and an intrinsic dielectric response is likely to be independent of frequency .",
    "the low - frequency data is also difficult to measure .",
    "equation ( [ z ] ) requires that @xmath48 should be in the measurable range of the analyser ( typically larger than 1@xmath27 ) but @xmath48 for r = ca@xmath6pr@xmath7 was too small near 10@xmath24 hz .",
    "a similar situation happened in the samples of @xmath12=0.7 and 1 below 10@xmath24 hz , where we failed to measure @xmath43 .",
    "an important finding is that @xmath43 remains positive even in the superconducting sample of r = ca@xmath6pr@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite reported nearly the same @xmath43 of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath3 ( 40 at 100 k at 10 ghz ) .",
    "this implies no divergence of @xmath43 at imt , as chen _",
    "_ @xcite suggested previously .",
    "we further note that the out - of - plane charge response is not drude - like , in the sense that @xmath8 is negative below the plasma frequency in the drude model .",
    "let us discuss the magnitude and the frequency dependence of @xmath43 .",
    "first , the large @xmath43 is not due to phonons or lattice instability , and should be attributed to an electronic excitation . unlike la@xmath0cuo@xmath46",
    ", bi-2212 is chemically stable and shows no structure phase transition .",
    "second the electronic excitation should be in the cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "we measured @xmath43 for the layered cobaltate bi - sr - co - o that has a similar bi@xmath0o@xmath0 layer , and found a small @xmath43 with essentially no relaxation behaviour @xcite .",
    "this indicates that neither the other block layers nor the layered structure can be an origin for the large @xmath43 .",
    "let us consider the electronic excitation through a simple lorentz model written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 are the oscillator strength , the resonance frequency , and the damping rate , respectively .",
    "for an overdamped case @xmath53 , equation ( [ lorentz ] ) reduces to the debye model of dielectric relaxation in the low frequency limit @xmath54 as @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "accordingly a large @xmath8 implies a small @xmath51 accompanied by a large @xmath50 .",
    "we can demonstrate that @xmath8 is small for a simple band insulator , where @xmath51 and @xmath50 correspond to the band gap and the drude weight of the valence electron .",
    "since these two are of the same order , the second term of equation ( [ debye ] ) gives of the order of unity for @xmath57 .",
    "note that @xmath8 is also small for a mott insulator , because the mott - hubbard gap is of the same order as the band gap .",
    "in other words , a single - particle gap is too large to give a large @xmath8 .",
    "a collective - excitation gap is most likely to be responsible for a large @xmath8 .",
    "it is known that the charge - density - wave ( or charge - ordered ) materials , such as k@xmath18moo@xmath10 @xcite , lufe@xmath0o@xmath46 @xcite , ( pr , ca)mno@xmath10 @xcite exhibit a large @xmath8 with relaxation behaviour , where @xmath51 is the pinning frequency of the charge density .",
    "this implies that a charge density modulation or a charge fluctuation exists in the cuo@xmath0 plane , which in principle can occur in the doped antiferromagnet . unlike the case of a doped semiconductor , holes in the parent insulator",
    "do not distribute uniformly .",
    "they tend to condense in order that they should minimise the exchange - energy loss of the antiferromagnetic background .",
    "prime examples are the charge stripe @xcite and the phase separation @xcite . thus we think that the observed dielectric response is a piece of evidence for the charge modulation in the parent insulator .    recent scanning tunnel microscope / spectroscopy has revealed unexpected inhomogeneous electronic states of htsc .",
    "_ @xcite found that the local density of states are inhomogeneous in the cuo@xmath0 plane of the optimally doped bi-2212 , where the doped carriers form a metallic patch .",
    "very recently howald _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also found superconducting and non - superconducting phases ( at a nanometer scale ) coexist in the cuo@xmath0 plane of the underdoped bi-2212 .",
    "this type of charge inhomogeneity could cause large @xmath8 , and is consistent with our observations .",
    "sr@xmath0rcu@xmath0o@xmath3 at 10  mhz plotted as a function of hole concentration per cu ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the @xmath21 was estimated by measuring the room - temperature thermopower .",
    ", width=302 ]    next let us discuss the the carrier concentration dependence . in figure [ f3 ] , @xmath43 and the out - of - plane conductivity @xmath58 for a representative frequency of 10@xmath47 hz at 80 k",
    "are plotted as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "most importantly , finite values of @xmath43 and @xmath58 are observed simultaneously .",
    "this contrasts strikingly with a case of a doped semiconductor , in which the insulating region is characterised by a finite @xmath8 and @xmath59 @xcite , whereas the metallic region is characterised by a finite @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 dependence in figure [ f3 ] suggests that the parent insulator is a mixture of an insulating and metallic phases .",
    "the increase of @xmath58 with @xmath21 suggests that carrier - doping makes locally metallic patches in the insulating background .",
    "the patches cause a large @xmath43 by fluctuating its position and a finite @xmath58 through the proximity effects .",
    "then the charge dynamics can be understood in terms of a percolative mixture of the insulating and metallic phases .",
    "accordingly the insulator - superconductor transition in bi-2212 occurs , when the metallic ( superconducting ) patches are connected with one another over a whole sample with proximity effects .",
    "now we will consider the anisotropy of @xmath8 . based on the inhomogeneity scenario ,",
    "@xmath8 is enhanced to be @xmath62 for @xmath63 , where @xmath50 is the drude weight of the metallic patch that is inversely proportional to the effective mass .",
    "it is therefore expected that @xmath64 is larger by the effective - mass ratio ( @xmath65 ) than @xmath43 , whereas the frequency and temperature dependences are nearly identical .",
    "this is what we observed in the preliminary measurements for @xmath64 of r = dy and er @xcite . in a superconducting sample ,",
    "the metallic patches are connected from edge to edge , and the carriers can move freely along the in - plane direction . for bi-2212 ,",
    "carriers near the cold spot ( @xmath66 ) dominates the in - plane transport @xcite , and are little affected by the inhomogeneity , because the local density of states is rather homogeneous along the ( @xmath66 ) ( nodal ) direction @xcite .",
    "this means that a drude - like charge response can occur along the in - plane direction .",
    "then @xmath64 changes with doping from positive to negative across the imt , at which the divergence of @xmath64 would be seen . on the other hand ,",
    "owing to the zero matrix element @xcite , carriers near ( @xmath66 ) can not move along the out - of - plane direction , and consequently can not screen the inhomogeneity in the cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "this is the reason the dielectric response along the out - of - plane direction remains unchanged at imt .",
    "finally we will compare our results with those by chen _",
    "_ @xcite at a qualitative level , our observations are similar to theirs : ( 1 ) @xmath43 increases with decreasing frequency , and ( 2 ) @xmath43 does not diverge at imt . however our measurement are free from the lattice instability , and includes the data for a superconductor , from which we have successfully shown that the items ( 1)(2 ) are generic for htsc .",
    "another discrepancy is that we understood the frequency dependence as the dielectric relaxation , while they employed the variable range hopping . considering @xmath67 of other parent insulators , we think that the relaxation behaviour is generic .",
    "perhaps this comes from the different temperatures measured .",
    "they discussed @xmath8 at 4 k , where the resistivity is also described in terms of variable range hopping .",
    "we found that the resistivity anisotropy is strongly dependent on temperature @xcite .",
    "the resistivity is almost isotropic at 4 k , and the parent insulator behaves three - dimensional . on the contrary",
    ", the resistivity is largely anisotropic above 80 k , and in particular the `` confinement '' is observed even in the parent insulator . thus it would be natural that the frequency dependence of @xmath8 is different between theirs and ours .",
    "we prepared single crystals of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0dy@xmath1er@xmath2cu@xmath0o@xmath3 , and measured the out - of - plane dielectric constants in the temperature range of 80 - 300 k and in the frequency range of @xmath4-@xmath5 hz .",
    "the dielectric constant of the parent insulator is characterised by the large magnitude and relaxation behaviour , which would come from the charge inhomogeneity recently observed in the scanning tunnel microscope experiments .",
    "the doping dependence of the dielectric constant and the conductivity suggests that the charge dynamics is understood as a percolation of the insulating and metallic phases , and that the insulator - superconductor transition happens when the metallic ( superconducting ) patches are connected with one another over a whole sample .",
    "the authors would like to thank s tajima , k yoshida and s tanaka for the technical support of rf impedance measurement .",
    "they also appreciate t sugaya and t mizuno for the preparation of the single crystals and the measurement of the thermopower , and t kitajima for collaboration at the early stage of the present study .",
    "this work is partially supported by the kawakami memorial foundation , and waseda university grant for special research projects ( 99a-556 ) .",
