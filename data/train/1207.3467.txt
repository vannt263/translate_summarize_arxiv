    "the simplicial category @xmath0 can be found in numerous contexts , in homotopy theory , category theory , and beyond . in some sense ,",
    "the structure of @xmath0 indexes the structure of a category : @xmath2 $ ] indexes objects , @xmath3 $ ] indexes morphisms , @xmath4 $ ] indexes composition of morphisms , and so forth .",
    "one picks out this structure in a category by taking the nerve functor , resulting in a simplicial set .",
    "many of the models for @xmath5-categories , such as segal categories , complete segal spaces , and quasi - categories , are given by simplicial objects of some kind and therefore make use of this formalism to make sense of categories up to homotopy .",
    "while not all simplicial diagrams give a category structure , the segal condition allows us to identify those that do , either strictly or up to homotopy .",
    "much more recently , moerdijk and weiss have introduced the dendroidal category @xmath1 which plays the same role for the structure of a colored operad @xcite .",
    "the objects are finite rooted trees , specifying every kind of composition that can take place .",
    "hence , they were able to understand @xmath5-operads as dendroidal diagrams , and cisinski and moerdijk have successfully been able to compare many different models which arise in this way @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "again , a segal condition is necessary to understand which dendroidal objects can be regarded as some kind of colored operad .    in @xcite , we sought to give a proof of an alternative perspective on the cisinski - moerdijk results in the case of ordinary single - colored operads , making a comparison to simplicial operads regarded as algebras over the theory of operads .",
    "however , we wished also to extend this result to have a comparison between the category of simplicial operads with a simplicial group action ( where the acting group as well as the action can vary through the category ) and some diagram category .",
    "it was expected that the indexing category for this structure should be built from @xmath0 and @xmath1 , encoding the acting group and the operad , respectively .",
    "the development of this category @xmath6 is the subject of this paper .    before we can understand the correct category for group actions on operads , we begin with a method for encoding category actions on categories , which can be restricted to the case of interest , where we have a group action .",
    "this case is of interest in its own right , as it can , for example , give models for group actions on @xmath7-categories of various flavors .",
    "the category we obtain is denoted @xmath8 .",
    "we plan to explore this model more extensively in future work .",
    "we can extend to the diagram @xmath6 which governs category actions on operads , which answers our original question . in @xcite",
    ", we establish the correct segal condition to use in this framework and give an explicit quillen equivalence between the corresponding model structure and the one on simplicial operads with a simplicial group action .    after defining these two diagrams of interest ,",
    "we establish some properties they posses . in the first case",
    ", we show that @xmath8 is a reedy category , and in fact an elegant reedy category in the sense of @xcite",
    ". this property will be useful in future work in that it guarantees that , when we consider the category of functors from it to the category of simplicial sets , the reedy and injective models are the same .",
    "we also show elegance for a planar version of @xmath6 .",
    "the category @xmath6 itself does not admit a reedy structure , since objects may possess nontrivial automorphisms , but we show that it is a generalized reedy category in the sense of @xcite .",
    "the category @xmath0 consists of the finite ordered sets @xmath9=(0<1 < \\cdots < n)$ ] and order - preserving maps between them .",
    "the category @xmath1 , on the other hand , has as objects finite rooted trees .",
    "for any such tree @xmath10 , one can take the free colored operad on it , where each edge is assigned a distinct color ; we denote this operad by @xmath11 .",
    "the morphisms @xmath12 in @xmath1 are defined to be the operad morphisms @xmath13 .",
    "we also have the variation @xmath14 whose objects are finite planar rooted trees . while @xmath1 governs symmetric colored operads , @xmath14 governs nonsymmetric operads .",
    "further details about these categories and their relationship with operads can be found in @xcite .      for a small category @xmath15",
    ", we denote the set of objects by @xmath16 and the set of morphisms by @xmath17 .",
    "we now define the notion of a category @xmath15 acting on a set @xmath18 analogously to that of a groupoid acting on a set as found in @xcite .",
    "the data of such an action consists of    * a _ moment _",
    "map @xmath19 , and * an _ action _",
    ".    an action is required to satisfy the following axioms :    * the moment respects the action , in the sense that @xmath21 ; * associativity , which is the usual action condition @xmath22_-{({\\operatorname{id } } , \\bullet ) } \\ar@{->}[d]_{(\\circ , { \\operatorname{id } } ) } & c_1 { \\,_{s}\\!\\times_{\\mu } } \\ar@{->}[d]^\\bullet a \\\\",
    "c_1 { \\,_{s}\\!\\times_{\\mu } } a \\ar@{->}[r]_-\\bullet & a ; } \\ ] ] and , * the identity acts trivially : @xmath23 .",
    "we write such an action as @xmath24 . in the notation since it can be recovered by examining @xmath25 . ]",
    "the collection of all such actions forms a category @xmath26 , where a morphism @xmath27 consists of a functor @xmath28 and a map of sets @xmath29 which satisfy @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in most situations we are working with a single action @xmath32 , and",
    "just write @xmath33 for @xmath24 .",
    "consider two categories @xmath15 and @xmath34 . an _ action _ of @xmath15 on @xmath34 is an action of the category @xmath15 on the set @xmath35 of morphisms of @xmath34 , satisfying two additional axioms .",
    "we write @xmath36 for the moment map and @xmath37 for the action map .",
    "the additional axioms are that @xmath38 for all @xmath39 and @xmath40 composable morphisms , and @xmath41 for all @xmath42 , @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "these axioms are derived from two foundational examples : the first is a category acting on itself via composition , and the second is a group acting on itself by conjugation .",
    "the second tells us that we should not have an axiom insisting that @xmath45 .",
    "we also note that @xmath46 , so we could just as well define @xmath47 .",
    "the collection of all such actions forms a category @xmath48 , where a morphism @xmath49 is a pair of functors @xmath28 and @xmath50 which respect the moment and action maps .",
    "notice that our definition is substantially more general than the standard notion of a groupoid acting on a groupoid , as found in @xcite . in that definition ,",
    "groupoids act on groupoids by functors . to cover examples such as the action of a category on itself we work in this greater generality .",

    "let @xmath51 be a set and @xmath52 be the category with only identity morphisms and object set @xmath51",

    "indeed , if we had @xmath42 so that @xmath54 , then we would also have @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which shows that @xmath57 .",

    "the action is as specified in the second diagram ( @xmath39 and @xmath65 are the only arrows that may be acted on by a non - identity element of @xmath58 since they are the only arrows of moment @xmath66 ) .",
