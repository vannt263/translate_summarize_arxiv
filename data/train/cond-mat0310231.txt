    "it seems possible that this effect corresponds to the commensurate resonance seen in other cuprates .    to test the connection with the resonance phenomenon , it is desirable to perform further characterizations .",

    "since the @xmath66 dependence of the spin fluctuations is generally chosen to match experiment in this approach , it can be either commensurate@xcite or incommensurate.@xcite    the most common approach is to calculate the magnetic response of the charge carriers themselves in the particle - hole channel , which is then enhanced with the random phase approximation.@xcite whether the calculated fluctuations are commensurate or incommensurate depends on the shape of the fermi surface.@xcite using a model dispersion that gives a fermi surface consistent with the results of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) for and bi@xmath20sr@xmath20cacu@xmath20o@xmath82 yields a commensurate resonance peak.@xcite    calculations@xcite for  have generally used parameters that give a fermi surface that is closed about @xmath83 , rather than about @xmath84 as in the bilayer cuprates ; however , it has been argued@xcite that the differences in models are not essential for obtaining the normal - state incommensurate structure in @xmath35 .",

    "et al._@xcite showed , on a sample with @xmath89 , that applying a field induces a signal within the spin gap .",
    "our results are generally consistent with theirs .",
    "one difference is that they observed an upturn in the low - energy ( 2.5 mev ) in - field signal as the temperature decreased below @xmath90  k , whereas we did not see such an upturn in our slightly overdoped sample .",

    "while these free spins can be detected by probes of the uniform spin susceptibility,@xcite it is not clear that they should play the dominant role in the observed changes in inelastic scattering .",
    "it seems likely that the observed changes must come from a significant range about each zn , and that they involve a slowing of stripe fluctuations in the vicinity of impurities , similar to the impact of vortices .",
