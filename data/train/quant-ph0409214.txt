    "the pendular cavity , or fabry - perot cavity in which one of the mirrors is free to oscillate , has previously been investigated by a number of researchers , both experimentally  @xcite , and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "closely related schemes have been theoretically proposed to entangle mirrors  @xcite and create superposition states of a mirror  @xcite .",
    "common to almost all the theoretical treatments is a linearisation of quantum langevin equations around their classical steady - state solutions  @xcite .",
    "this then allows for the relatively simple calculation of spectral quantities which may be measured outside the cavity .",
    "results obtained in this way have been used to analyse the sensitivity of gravity wave interferometers  @xcite , predict the suppression of quantum noise  @xcite , propose quantum nondemolition measurements of photon number  @xcite , analyse the quantum limits to measurements with an atomic force microscope  @xcite , analyse the quantum noise in position measurements of the oscillating mirror  @xcite , calculate the phase noise in the cavity field  @xcite , predict the entanglement of macroscopic oscillators via radiation pressure  @xcite , and propose the quantum locking of interferometer mirrors  @xcite . using the state - vector approach so common in quantum computing theory , it has been proposed that quantum superpositions , entanglement and near - number states of the cavity field , along with superposition states of the mirror , can be produced with this system  @xcite . using a similar state - vector approach",
    ", it has been proposed that quantum superpositions of a mirror may be created by the interaction with a single photon  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the linearised fluctuation analysis used in the majority of the theoretical papers cited above is limited in its applicability .",
    "it has been shown , for example , that the mean - field equations derived in this way can give misleading results for travelling - wave second harmonic generation  @xcite and for the intracavity interaction between light and condensed atoms  @xcite as well as in raman photoassociation of atomic bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",
    "the spectra calculated via this method are also known to not be accurate near any critical points of the system , as has been shown with the optical parametric oscillator  @xcite .",
    "there are two conditions which must be fulfilled for a linearised analysis to be trustworthy .",
    "the first has to do with the sign of the real part of the eigenvalues of the drift matrix of the equations written for the fluctuations ; if these have the wrong sign the fluctuations can grow exponentially and the analysis loses its validity .",
    "the second has to do with the size of the fluctuations themselves , in relation to the classical steady - state values .",
    "as we will show , this second condition is not fulfilled for this system , as the quantum state of the mirror , or more accurately , of the mirror phonons , is reasonably expected to be thermal .",
    "a characteristic of a thermal state is that the variance is larger than the mean value , which therefore makes any expression of the mirror phonons as having some well - defined classical mean value plus small fluctuations rather dubious .",
    "even though cooling of the mirror via feedback mechanisms has been achieved  @xcite , and analysed theoretically  @xcite , due to the nature of the coupling between the electromagnetic field and the mirror phonons , it seems that all that can be achieved is a thermal state at a lower temperature , so that the problem remains .    to treat the macroscopic mirror quantum mechanically",
    "we will begin with the hamiltonian approach of law  @xcite , in the approximation that only a single optical mode is important , and extended to include cavity pumping and damping . to treat the fluctuations of the mirror which result from its coupling to a thermal reservoir , we will use the brownian motion master equation developed by disi  @xcite , which is suitable for the temperatures we will consider here . following a common procedure in quantum optics  @xcite , we will develop a fokker - planck equation in the positive - p representation  @xcite .",
    "this fokker - planck equation allows us to write stochastic differential equations which are an exact mapping from the system master equation , and which can be used to calculate any desired normally - ordered operator moments .",
    "we consider a system of a pumped fabry - perot cavity in which one of the mirrors is free to undergo oscillatory motion due to both the light pressure and thermal fluctuations .",
    "we use the standard annihilation , @xmath1 , and creation , @xmath2 operators for the electromagnetic field , and the operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the displacement from the equilibrium position and the momentum of the mirror , which will be treated as a harmonic oscillator . neglecting the coupling of the mirror to its bath for the moment",
    ", we can write the hamiltonian as @xmath5 where @xmath6 in the above , @xmath7 is the field frequency , @xmath8 represents the classical real pump , @xmath9 is the mass of the mirror , @xmath10 is the mirror oscillation frequency and @xmath11 is the coupling between the mirror and the cavity field , with @xmath12 being the length of the cavity .",
    "the @xmath13s represent optical bath operators .",
    "the damping of the mirror , which we will treat as markovian , will be included at the next step .",
    "we now wish to write a master equation for the density matrix of our combined system in a frame rotating at @xmath7 . to do this",
    ", we will make two different , but consistent approximations for the damping of the cavity and the mirror .",
    "the cavity reservoir will be considered to be at zero temperature , which is consistent with the very high temperatures necessary to produce thermal photons at the frequencies involved .",
    "the mirror reservoir will be treated as being at a finite temperature , which is necessary because of the number of thermal phonons which will be present in the system . as the temperatures required to create these respective excitations differ by many orders of magnitude , these approximations are not contradictory .",

    "rather than writing the heisenberg equations of motion , which are difficult to solve , we will make use of the original definition  @xcite of the annihilation and creation operators in terms of @xmath3 and @xmath4 and develop stochastic differential equations in the positive - p representation  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to use c - number equations which describe all the quantum properties of the mirror dynamics contained in the original master equation .",

    "the damping rate of the mirror is @xmath90s@xmath40 at @xmath43k .",
    "we consider a cavity length of @xmath91 cm , with cavity finesse @xmath92 , which gives @xmath93s@xmath40 .",
    "we consider an optical wavelength of @xmath94 nm , which gives @xmath95s@xmath40 , and a coupling between the light and the mirror of @xmath96m@xmath40s@xmath40 .",
    "the optical pumping of the cavity is @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the laser power in watts .    in stochastic integration of the equations which describe an intracavity optical system ,",
    "the standard approach is to begin with the state inside the cavity as vacuum so that , with a continuous pump , the system enters the steady - state ( or its limit cycle behaviour in the case of self - pulsing ) after a few cavity lifetimes . in the present case",
    "the situation is somewhat different , as not only the electromagnetic field , but also the oscillating mirror , has to reach the steady - state . as the relaxation time of the mirror",
    "can be orders of magnitude larger than that of the intracavity field , and we need to average over a large number of trajectories to obtain reliable results , it is not practical to begin the integration with an arbitrary initial condition for the mirror .",
    "naively beginning with @xmath99 , the ground state of the mirror , leads to extremely long lived transients , as this is far from the equilibrium state at finite temperature . to give some idea ,",
    "even at @xmath43k , which is perhaps the lowest easily achievable temperature , the average number of mirror quanta becomes @xmath100 . for purposes of comparison , we will therefore choose the initial mirror state in two different ways and integrate the equations without any pumping of the cavity .",
    "firstly , as a ( real ) coherent state , which has uncertainties in position and momentum at the sql , with the p - function @xmath101 and , secondly from the thermal distribution @xmath102 where @xmath103 . note that , at the beginning of each trajectory , @xmath104 and the phase is completely random for the thermal distribution .",
    "we stress here that the variance in the number of mirror phonons for a thermal state is @xmath105 , which is very much larger than @xmath106 . using the planck distribution , @xmath107",
    "we find that to achieve @xmath108 , we would need @xmath109k , and even then the variance would be @xmath0 , or twice the mean value .",
    "it is important to note here that the number of phonons does not enter into the equations , but rather the quadratures @xmath110 and @xmath111 . in a linearised approach using our equations , it is the uncertainties in these which are important .",
    "we can easily calculate these for a thermal state of the mirror with an unpumped cavity .",
    "a simple integration gives @xmath112 equal to @xmath113 at @xmath114k for our system .",
    "this is in stark contrast to a coherent state of the mirror , sometimes used to facilitate the mathematics of a linearised analysis , and for which @xmath115 .     at @xmath114k and @xmath116k for an initial coherent state of the mirror and no optical pumping .",
    "these results are the averages of @xmath117 and @xmath118 trajectories , respectively .",
    "note that , unless otherwise stated , the values plotted here and in subsequent graphs are dimensionless . ]    we have calculated the stochastic results for the means and standard deviations of the mirror position , without any optical pumping and for initial thermal and coherent states of the mirror at temperatures of @xmath43k and @xmath88k . in fig .",
    "[ fig : xpumpco0 ] we show the stochastic results for the position , @xmath61 , of the mirror , with initial coherent states at these two temperatures . considering only these mean values",
    "could give the erroneous impression that the mirror is in a non - stationary steady - state , which we can immediately see is not the case when we look at fig .",
    "[ fig : vxpumpco0 ] , which shows the standard deviations , @xmath119 , for the same parameters .",
    "although we have shown the standard deviations here , the variances for the initial coherent state continue to increase linearly for more than twice the time shown , which was as far as we continued the integration .",
    "in contrast , for an initial thermal state , the mean value of the mirror displacement is , by definition , zero as can be seen from the equation for the p - function ( [ eq : pthermal ] ) .",
    "we note here that our stochastic results over more than @xmath120 trajectories still showed oscillations of the order of @xmath121 m , but that we are confident that this small , but non - zero , value is due to the difficulty of sampling the distribution with a finite number of trajectories . by comparison with the coherent state values , for an initial thermal state @xmath122 m at @xmath114k , and is almost constant , indicating that this is a good choice of initial condition .",
    "this value agrees well with the expression given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the thermal noise , @xmath123 , which gives a value of @xmath124 m .",
    "note that , over the time scales shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xpumpco0 ] we do not see any decay in the oscillations towards the thermal state values , as this would be expected to happen on a time scale of @xmath125 , which is approximately @xmath126s for the parameters used here .",
    "in fact , although an initial coherent state of the mirror has been used in theoretical analyses ( see , for example , bose _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , it is not at all obvious how this particular state may be constructed experimentally .",
    "a thermal state arises naturally , and will be equal to a coherent state for @xmath127k , but absolute zero can not be reached experimentally . in optics ,",
    "a coherent state can be described theoretically as a displacement of the vacuum by the displacement operator @xmath128 , which we can see has some relation to the optical pumping term of the hamiltonian , @xmath129 .",
    "therefore an ideal empty cavity with this pumping term will naturally develop an intracavity coherent state .",
    "we are not aware of any similar candidate for the mirror , even if it could begin in the @xmath127 vacuum state",
    ". therefore we will use an initial thermal state in our investigations .     at @xmath114k and @xmath116k for an initial coherent state of the mirror and no optical pumping .",
    "note that these quantities were still increasing at twice the time shown here and would be expected to eventually attain the thermal values . ]    when we examine the stochastic results for the intracavity field intensity , for an input power @xmath130mw , we find that the field exhibits a self - pulsing behaviour at approximately the resonance frequency of the mirror , as previously predicted  @xcite .",
    "however , the oscillations are of very small relative amplitude , at approximately @xmath131 of the average mean intensity . with increasing input power ,",
    "the oscillations become larger until , for a power of @xmath132mw , for example , they are more than half the maximum intensity . at the lower power ,",
    "the mean motion of the mirror is an oscillation between @xmath133 and @xmath134 m , while at the higher power oscillates between @xmath135 and @xmath136 m . even though these displacements are truly microscopic , they have a noticeable effect on the mean intensity , which should be easily detectable experimentally .",
    "interestingly enough , these results are almost identical to what we find by numerical integration of the classical equations ( [ eq : meanbeta ] ) , although these can tell us nothing about the quantum correlations which we wish to investigate . among these quantum correlations",
    "are the variances of the intracavity field and the fano factor , defined as @xmath137 .",
    "these results , which we averaged over @xmath138 trajectories , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : luzvar ] . for a coherent state ,",
    "all three values are @xmath23 , which would be zero on the logarithmic vertical scale used here .",
    "as all three correlations are greater than or equal to one , we do not see any squeezing of the field in the time domain , but do see excess noise in all three quantities . as is common with kerr media , there is more excess noise in the @xmath139 quadrature than in either the @xmath140 quadrature or in the intensity .",
    "the solid line is @xmath141 , the dash - dotted line is @xmath142 , and the dotted line is the fano factor . ]      much of the theoretical and experimental interest in this system has been in indirectly measuring small displacements or small forces which act on the oscillating mirror , by means of measurements on the optical field . generally theoretical results are presented in terms of output spectra which allow for an inferred value of the mirror position at various frequencies .",
    "these spectra are simple to calculate in a linearised analysis which treats the system as an ornstein - uhlenbeck process  @xcite , but we do not consider linearisation valid here , for the reasons we have stated . to calculate spectra from the results of stochastic integration",
    "is also possible in many cases , but here is made difficult by the stiffness of our equations , where the field and the mirror oscillate on vastly different time scales .",
    "the length of time needed to integrate a large enough number of trajectories over a sufficient time to give reliable results upon fourier transformation is prohibitive .",
    "hence we will show results which were obtained in the time domain .",
    "the first results we show for the mirror , in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigxp ] , are for the uncertainties in the mirror position and momentum , defined as @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the interaction with the field has not noticeably changed these quantities from the values we found via stochastic integration in the unpumped thermal state case , but has given the momentum a mean value which oscillates between approximately @xmath145kgms@xmath40 , whereas it was stable at zero in the unpumped case .",
    "it is readily seen that the fluctuations in momentum are several orders of magnitude larger than the mean value .",
    "we also note here that the uncertainties shown are certainly underestimated , due to the difficulties of simulating the large @xmath68 values with small probabilities in the initial conditions used .",
    "this result also shows that , when the likely thermal state of the mirror is taken into account , the back - action noise of the field on the mirror has very little effect at the laser power considered here . at an increased power of @xmath132mw",
    "the standard deviations in both position and momentum both increase due to this back - action noise , reaching oscillatory values around means of @xmath146 , while the mean momentum oscillates between @xmath147kgms@xmath40 .",

    "units for position and momentum are used . note that a minimum uncertainty state of the mirror has @xmath148 m and @xmath149kgms@xmath40 . ]",
    "we next investigate the degree of correlation between the position of the mirror , the intracavity optical intensity , and the @xmath140 and @xmath139 quadratures .",
    "this correlation function between two quantities @xmath150 and @xmath55 is defined as @xmath151 where a perfect correlation gives a value of @xmath23 , a perfect anticorrelation gives a value of @xmath135 and zero signifies no correlation at all . in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrfun ] we see that , as predicted by eq .",
    "[ eq : expansion ] , the strongest correlation is between @xmath139 and the mirror position , these two being almost perfectly correlated .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath152 and @xmath153 oscillate at the frequency @xmath10 between a value of almost minus one and a value of approximately zero , ranging from being almost perfectly anticorrelated to almost perfectly uncorrelated .",
    "this behaviour is quite different from that shown in a linearised fluctuation analysis , where we found that all three of these functions showed anticorrelation around the mirror frequency and were zero at other frequencies .",
    "the difference between our fully quantum nonlinear results and the usual linearised predictions is dramatically demonstrated when we consider @xmath154 , used to analyse a possible quantum nondemolition measurement by jacobs _",

    "the pendular cavity and variations on the theme have been proposed as useful devices for the preparation of nonclassical states of the cavity field and also of the mirror or mirrors . in this section",
    "we will give a brief review of some of these proposals , in chronological order , and explain why our results lead us to believe that they may not be as practical as the original authors suggest .",
    "bose _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggest that this system may be used to prepare multi - component schrdinger cat states of the field , near number states , and entangled states when two or more modes interact with the mirror , as well as schrdinger cat - like states of the mirror prepared via quadrature measurements of the field .",
    "beginning with a simple hamiltonian without any pumping or dissipation terms , they develop a time evolution operator which is seen to have a kerr - like term , which leads them to believe that this system may exhibit some of the nonclassical features of a kerr interaction .",
    "they then assume that both the cavity field and the mirror are initially in coherent states .",
    "while this simplifies the mathematics , and is reasonably accurate for the cavity field , our calculations have shown that a coherent state is not a reasonable initial condition for the mirror . as the nonclassical features predicted",
    "depend on this initial condition , which at one stage of the paper is taken to be a vacuum state ( for simplicity ) , and interaction of the mirror with the environment is considered to be equivalent to that of a cavity field with a zero temperature reservoir , our results lead us to believe that these predicted nonclassical states will be , at the very least , extremely difficult to observe .    in a subsequent article  @xcite",
    ", the same authors propose that the pendular cavity may be used to probe the decoherence of a macroscopic object , namely the mirror . in this work",
    "the authors accept that the mirror will begin in a thermal state and note that a mixture of schrdinger cat states of the mirror can therefore be produced by the interaction with the field .",
    "it is assumed that a superposition of the fock states @xmath172 and @xmath173 can be prepared inside the cavity , with the most simply prepared value of @xmath174 . using the p - representation expansion of the density matrix in terms of coherent states , an expression is found for the time development of this density matrix .",
    "the field can then be measured via the interaction with a ground state two - level atom which is passed through the cavity .",
    "the probability of the atom being excited can be related to the decoherence rate of the spatially separated superposed coherent states of the mirror s motion . examining this scheme with our parameters , we find that , with @xmath174 , the spatial separation between two of the superposed coherent states has a maximum of @xmath175 m , which is less than the thermal de broglie wavelength , @xmath176 m , so that it becomes difficult to claim we have a spatially separated superposition . when we take into account that the decomposition of the thermal state will include a huge number of coherent states , all with different phases",
    ", it seems that the practical realisation of this scheme may be more demanding technologically than the authors had supposed .",
    "another proposal uses radiation pressure to entangle two macroscopic mirrors  @xcite , but relies on langevin equations which are linearised around their classical steady - state solutions . as we have shown above",
    ", this process is of rather doubtful validity when the mirrors are coupled to thermal reservoirs .",
    "a further idea is to produce an einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) state in the position and momentum of two spatially separated oscillating mirrors using the output of a nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator ( opo )  @xcite .",
    "we note here that , although the authors call the oscillator an optical parametric amplifier , the nonlinear crystal is inside a pumped cavity , so we will follow the usual terminology .",
    "( see their fig.2 ) unlike most other treatments , this work uses an effective linear coupling between the light and the mirror .",
    "like most of the others , the authors linearise langevin equations around their steady state solutions .",
    "the opo is treated via two - mode equations which do not describe the normal well - known threshold behaviour of such a device at all , and lead to the prediction of an entangled state of two combined quadratures , which is said to demonstrate an epr correlation .",
    "the two output fields of the opo are used to drive the two mirrors , which drives them into an epr state of position and momentum .",
    "the mechanical damping of the mirrors introduces a noise term @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is the mean thermal phonon number .",
    "this noise term seems to be the quadrature variance assuming a number state @xmath179 , of the mirror . for the parameters we use ,",
    "this expression gives a value of @xmath180 , several orders of magnitude lower than our estimate in eq .",
    "[ eq : vxybthermal ] , which gives @xmath181 .",
    "due to the issues we have raised here , we are lead to believe that the epr state of the two mirrors may not be as easily demonstrated as indicated by the authors .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have also put forward a proposal to entangle two movable mirrors which form part of a four - mirror ring cavity .",
    "this work has the advantage of a description for the brownian motion that is consistent with quantum mechanics at all temperatures , but the results presented are also obtained following a linearisation process , which we have shown to not be valid for reasonable temperatures .",
    "the final proposal we will consider here is by marshall _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which treats the creation of superposition states of a macroscopic mirror ( @xmath182 atoms ) via the interaction with a single photon .",
    "this work again uses a hamiltonian approach without dissipation and assumes that the mirror can be prepared in its ground state , @xmath172 , which then allows for analytical solutions . the inclusion of decoherence and finite temperature follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and we therefore have the same doubts about the physical viability of this proposal .",
    "it may be thought that to reduce the thermal noise of the mirror it is sufficient to cool to a lower temperature and impressive reductions in thermal noise , of the order of @xmath183 , have been achieved  @xcite .",
    "however , it seems that the method of feedback cooling leads to a thermal equilibrium of the mirror at a lower temperature . for our system , using eq .",
    "[ eq : vxybthermal ] , a reduction by this factor leads to @xmath184 , which is still far above the coherent state level where linearisation of the equations may be expected to work .",
    "@xcite suggests that a mirror may be cooled to as low as @xmath0mk by dilution refrigeration , which would give us @xmath185 , which , if we assume that feedback cooling from this temperature is as efficient as at room temperature , would allow the variances to be further reduced to something of the order of @xmath186 .",
    "this is now actually smaller than the mean number of quanta , @xmath187 , equal to @xmath188 , although the variance in the number will now be of the order of @xmath189 , so that linearisation will still not be reliable .",
    "standard cooling by feedback depends on the interaction of the electromagnetic field with the mirror phonons , which is proportional to @xmath190 , which will not drive the mirror toward a coherent state .",
    "a coupling term proportional to @xmath191 may be expected to do this , while squeezing of the mirror position would conceivably be possible with a coupling of the type @xmath192 or @xmath193 .",
    "it is interesting to note that an effective coupling of the type required to drive the mirror toward a coherent state was used by zhang _",

    "@xcite , although the physical parameters used to develop the coupling hamiltonian are far from those we have used in our analysis . as an example in that work , @xmath194 , whereas we have used the values @xmath195s@xmath40 and @xmath196s@xmath40 .",

    "@xcite have actually presented a feedback scheme based on an effective hamiltonian which couples a light quadrature with @xmath197 , later proposing that this method , which they call stochastic cooling , could be used to beat the sql by achieving steady - state position squeezing of the mirror  @xcite .",
    "the effective coupling used again depends on the linearisation of the equations of motion . we feel that whether feedback can be used to cool a macroscopic oscillator towards , or even beyond , the sql remains an open question and subject to further research .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a fully quantum analysis of the pumped pendular cavity which does not depend on linearisation of the equations of motion .",
    "we have shown that the thermal noise of the mirror is overwhelming for typical temperatures and experimental parameters .",
    "this means that the linearisation procedure commonly used is of doubtful validity .",
    "unless ways can be found to change the quantum state of the mirror in respect to the thermal excitations , we expect that the nonclassical states predicted in a number of theoretical analyses will not be able to be demonstrated experimentally .",
    "feedback cooling techniques , while able to lower the effective temperature to an impressive degree , serve merely to produce another thermal state of the mirror at a lower temperature .",
