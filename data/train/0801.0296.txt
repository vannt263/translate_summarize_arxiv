    "recent experimental advances in nuclear spectroscopic techniques following coulomb excitations , in - elastic neutron scattering , and thermal neutron capture have made it possible to carry out a detailed investigation of @xmath0-vibrational bands in atomic nuclei @xcite .",
    "these bands are observed in both spherical and as well as in deformed nuclei . in spherical nuclei ,",
    "the vibrational modes are well described using the harmonic phonon model @xcite .",
    "although exact harmonic motion has never been observed , there are numerous examples of nuclei exhibiting near harmonic vibrational motion . as a matter of fact ,",
    "one- and two - phonon excitations have been reported in a large class of spherical nuclei . in deformed nuclei ,",
    "vibrational motion is possible around the equilibrium of deformed shape configuration .",
    "the deformed intrinsic shape is parameterized in terms of @xmath3 and @xmath0 deformation variables .",
    "these parameters are related to the axial and non - axial shapes of a deformed nucleus .",
    "the one - phonon vibrational mode in deformed nuclei with no component of angular momentum along the symmetry axis ( @xmath4 ) is called @xmath3-vibration and the vibrational mode with component of angular momentum along the symmetry axis ( @xmath5 ) is referred to as @xmath0-vibration .",
    "the rotational bands based on the @xmath0-vibrational state are known as @xmath0-bands @xcite .",
    "one - phonon @xmath0-bands have been observed in numerous deformed nuclei in most of the regions of the periodic table .",
    "there has also been reports on observation of two - phonon @xmath0-bands @xcite .",
    "several theoretical models have been proposed to study @xmath0- bands with varying degree of success . the quasiparticle phonon nuclear model ( qpnm ) @xcite , which restricts",
    "the basis to , at the most , two phonon states , has led to the conclusion that two - phonon collective vibrational excitations can not exist in deformed nuclei due to the pauli blocking of important quasiparticle components . on the other hand , the multi - phonon method ( mpm ) @xcite",
    "embodies an entirely different truncation scheme .",
    "it employs only a few collective phonons and restricts the basis to all the corresponding multi - phonon states up to eight phonons .",
    "this approach predicts that , for strongly collective vibrations , two phonon @xmath6 excitations should appear at an energy of about 2.6 times the energy of the one - phonon @xmath7 state @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamic deformation model ( ddm ) @xcite , which is quite different from the models mentioned above , constructs collective potential from a set of deformed single - particle basis states accommodating eight major oscillator shells .",
    "this model predicts a collective @xmath6 at almost 2 mev .",
    "all the above mentioned models ( qpnm , mpm , and ddm ) do not have their wave functions as eigen - states of angular momentum . strictly speaking , these methods",
    "do not calculate the states of angular momentum , but the @xmath8-states ( @xmath8 is the projection of angular momentum on the intrinsic symmetry axis ) . to apply these models ,",
    "one has to assume that @xmath9 .",
    "however , since an intrinsic @xmath8-state can generally have its components spread over the space of angular momenta of @xmath10 , the reliability of these approaches depends critically on actual situation . as pointed out by soloviev @xcite , it is quit desirable to recover the good angular - momentum in the wave functions .",
    "some algebraic models including the extended version of the interacting boson ( sdg - ibm ) @xcite and pseudo - symplectic models @xcite have also been employed to study the @xmath0- excitation modes and predict high collectivity for the double @xmath0- vibration @xcite .",
    "recently , the triaxial projected shell model ( tpsm ) has been employed to describe @xmath0- bands @xcite .",
    "this model uses shell model diagonalization approach and in this sense , it is similar to the conventional shell model approach except that the basis states in the tpsm are triaxially deformed rather than spherical . in the present version of the model , the intrinsic deformed basis is constructed from the triaxial nilsson potential .",
    "the good angular momentum states are then obtained through exact three - dimensional angular momentum projection technique . in the final stage ,",
    "the configuration mixing is performed by diagonalizing the pairing plus quadrupole - quadrupole hamiltonian in the projected basis @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the tpsm is that it describes the deformed single - particle states microscopically as in qpnm , mpm , and ddm , but its total many - body states are exact eigen states of angular momentum operator .",
    "correlations beyond the mean - field are introduced by mixing the projected configurations .",
    "it is to be noted that an intrinsic triaxial state in the tpsm is a rich superposition of different @xmath8-states .",
    "for instance , the triaxial deformed vacuum state is composed of @xmath11 configurations .",
    "the projected bands from these @xmath12 and 4 intrinsic states are the dominant components of the ground- , @xmath0- , and 2@xmath0-bands , respectively @xcite .    in the earlier tpsm analysis for even - even nuclei ,",
    "the shell model space was very restrictive , including only 0-quasiparticle ( qp ) state @xcite .",
    "this strongly limited the application of the tpsm to the low - spin and low - excitation region only .",
    "it was not possible to study high - spin states because multi - qp configurations will usually become important for states with @xmath13 in the normally deformed rare - earth nuclei . in the present work",
    ", the qp - space is enlarged to incorporate the two - neutron - qp , two - proton - qp and four - qp configuration consisting of two protons plus two neutrons .",
    "this large qp space is adequate to describe the bands up to second bandcrossing @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is , as a first application of the extended model , to perform a detailed investigation of the high - spin band structures , in particular @xmath0-bands , of erbium isotopes ranging from mass number @xmath14 to 170 . in a parallel work @xcite ,",
    "the tpsm analysis for odd - odd nuclei in a multi - qp space has been performed .",
    "the manuscript is organized in the following manner : in the next section , a brief description of the tpsm method is presented .",
    "the results of the tpsm study are presented and discussed in section iii .",
    "finally , the work is summarized in section iv .",
    "in the present work , the tpsm qp basis is extended , which consists of projected 0-qp vacuum , 2-proton ( 2p ) , 2-neutron ( 2n ) , and 4-qp states , i.e. , @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ basis ] ) , the three - dimensional angular - momentum operator is @xcite @xmath16 with the rotational operator @xmath17 and @xmath18 represents the triaxial qp vacuum state .",
    "the qp basis chosen above are adequate to describe the high - spin states upto , say @xmath19 , and in the present analysis we shall restrict to this spin regime .",
    "the triaxially deformed qp states are generated by the nilsson hamiltonian @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the spherical single - particle hamiltonian , which contains a proper spin - orbit force @xcite . the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 describe axial quadrupole and triaxial deformations , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that for the case of axial - symmetry , the qp vacuum state has @xmath4 , whereas in the present case of triaxial deformation , the vacuum state @xmath18 is a superposition of all the possible @xmath8-values .",
    "the allowed values of the @xmath8-quantum number for a given intrinsic state are obtained through the following symmetry consideration . for the symmetry operator , @xmath24",
    ", we have @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 characterizes the intrinsic states in eq .",
    "( [ basis ] ) . for the self - conjugate vacuum or 0-qp state , @xmath28 and , therefore",
    ", it follows from the above equation that only @xmath29 even values are permitted for this state . for 2-qp states , the possible values for @xmath8-quantum number",
    "are both even and odd depending on the structure of the qp state . for the 2-qp state formed from the combination of the normal and the time - reversed states , @xmath30 and ,",
    "therefore , only @xmath29 even values are permitted . for the combination of the two normal states , @xmath31 and only @xmath29 odd states",
    "are permitted .    as in the earlier projected shell model ( psm ) calculations",
    ", we use the pairing plus quadrupole - quadrupole hamiltonian @xcite @xmath32 the interaction strengths are taken as follows : the @xmath33-force strength @xmath34 is adjusted such that the physical quadrupole deformation @xmath22 is obtained as a result of the self - consistent mean - field hfb calculation @xcite .",
    "the monopole pairing strength @xmath35 is of the standard form @xmath36/a,\\ ] ] with ",
    "@xmath37 \" for neutrons and  @xmath38 \" for protons , which approximately reproduces the observed odd  even mass differences in the rare - earth mass region .",
    "this choice of @xmath35 is appropriate for the single - particle space employed in the psm , where three major shells are used for each type of nucleons ( @xmath39 for neutrons and @xmath40 for protons ) . the quadrupole pairing strength @xmath41 is assumed to be proportional to @xmath35 , and the proportionality constant being fixed as 0.18 .",
    "these interaction strengths are consistent with those used earlier for the same mass region @xcite .",
    "the triaxial projected shell model calculations have been performed for er - isotopes ranging from @xmath42 = 156 to 170 .",
    "the deformation parameters @xmath43 used in the present work are same as those employed in ref .",
    "it has already been mentioned in section ii that in the present work the mean - field potential is constructed with given input deformation values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in a more realistic calculation , these deformation values for a given system are obtained through the variational hfb calculations .",
    "the chosen values of @xmath22 for the present calculation are those from the measured quadrupole deformations of the nuclei as is done in the previous projected shell model analysis .",
    "the @xmath23 values used in the present work are realistic , which correctly reproduce , for example , excitations of the @xmath0 band relative to the ground - state @xcite .",
    "band diagrams can bring valuable information regarding the underlying physics @xcite .",
    "these band diagrams for the studied er - isotopes are presented in figs . 1 to 4 and depict the results of the projected energies for each intrinsic configuration . in the diagrams ,",
    "the projected energies are shown for 0 , 2n , 2p and 2p+2n quasiparticle configurations .",
    "the qp energies for these configurations are given in the legend of each figure .",
    "as already mentioned in the last section that with the triaxial basis , the intrinsic states do not have a well - defined @xmath8-quantum number .",
    "each triaxial configuration in eq.([basis ] ) is a composition of several @xmath8-values and bands in figs .",
    "1 to 4 are obtained by assigning a given @xmath8-value in the angular - momentum projection oprator . to make the discussion easy",
    ", we denote a @xmath8-state of an @xmath44-configuration as @xmath45 , with @xmath46 , 2n , 2p and 4 .",
    "for example , the @xmath4 state of 0-qp configuration is marked as @xmath47 and @xmath48 of 2n - qp configuration as ( 1 , 2n ) .    in figs . 1 to 4 , the projected bands associated with the 0-qp configuration are shown for @xmath49 , and 4 , namely the ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 2 , 0 ) , and ( 4 , 0 ) bands . in the literature , these @xmath12 , and 4 bands",
    "are referred to as ground - state , @xmath0- , and @xmath50-bands .",
    "the ground - state band has @xmath28 and is , therefore , comprised of only even-@xmath8 values .",
    "we use the same names in the following discussion to be consistent with the literature , but stress that in our final results obtained after diagonalisation , @xmath8 is not a strictly conserved quantum number due to configuration mixing .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "1 that the ( 2 , 0 ) bands for @xmath1er and @xmath2er lie very close to the ( 0 , 0 ) bands .",
    "this means that @xmath0- vibration has low excitation energy in these two nuclei . for high - spin states",
    ", it is further noted that the ( 0 , 0 ) and ( 2 , 0 ) band energies become almost degenerate , and as a matter fact for @xmath51 and above , the energy of even - spin states in the ( 2 , 0 ) band is slightly lower than the ( 0 , 0 ) band .",
    "it is a well - known fact that @xmath0-bands become lower in energy with increasing triaxility and what is also evident from fig .",
    "1 that they become favored with increasing angular - momentum . as can be seen from fig .",
    "1 , the ( 2 , 0 ) bands in @xmath1er and @xmath2er also depict pronounced signature splitting with the splitting amplitude increasing with spin . the ( 4 , 0 ) band is close to the ( 2 , 0 ) band for @xmath1er and lies at a slightly higher excitation energy for @xmath2er . the ( 4 , 0 ) bands in these two isotopes are also noted to have signature splitting for higher angular momenta , and the splitting amplitude is nearly the same for the ( 2 , 0 ) and ( 4 , 0 ) bands .    in fig . 1 ,",
    "several representative multi - qp bands , namely projected 2- and 4-qp configurations , are also plotted .",
    "although the @xmath48 2-qp neutron ( 1 , 2n ) and 2-qp proton ( 1 , 2p ) bands are close in energy for low spins , but with increasing spin the 2n - qp bands are lower in energy than 2p - qp bands due to larger rotational alignment . it is noted that neutrons are occupying 1i@xmath52 and protons are occupying 1h@xmath53 intruder sub - shells . for each of the ( 1 , 2n ) and ( 1 , 2p ) bands , the projected energies are also shown for the corresponding @xmath0-bands with configurations ( 3 , 2n ) and ( 3 , 2p ) .",
    "the ( 1 , 2n ) band is noted to cross the ( 2 , 0 ) and the ( 0 , 0 ) bands at @xmath54 .",
    "it is also seen that the ( 3 , 2n ) band crosses the ( 0 , 0 ) band at a slightly higher spin value of @xmath55 .",
    "it is interesting to note that after the band crossing , the lowest even - spin states originate from the ( 1 , 2n ) band , whereas the odd - spin members are the projected states from the ( 3 , 2n ) configuration .",
    "finally , the 4-qp ( 4 , 4 ) configuration lies at high excitation energies and does not become yrast , at - least , up to the spin values shown in the figure .",
    "the band diagrams for @xmath56er and @xmath57er are presented in fig.2 .",
    "the energy separation between the ( 0 , 0 ) and ( 2 , 0 ) bands is larger as compared to the two lighter isotopes in fig .",
    "1 . in the case of @xmath56er ,",
    "the ( 2 , 0 ) band energies do come close to the ( 0 , 0 ) energies for spins @xmath58 .",
    "the ( 1 , 2n ) band again crosses the ( 0 , 0 ) band at @xmath54 for @xmath56er and at @xmath55 for @xmath57er .",
    "the band diagrams for @xmath59er and @xmath60er shown in fig . 3 depict larger energy gaps among various bands .",
    "the signature splitting of the ( 2 , 0 ) band has considerably reduced .",
    "it is further noted that 2n - band - crossing is shifted to higher spin values .",
    "for the case of @xmath59er , the band crossing is observed to occur at @xmath51 and for @xmath60er it occurs at @xmath61 .",
    "the band diagrams for @xmath62er and @xmath63er shown in fig . 4 indicate that the ( 2 , 0 ) bands are quite high in excitation energy .",
    "the band crossing for these cases is further shifted to higher spin values .      in the second stage of the calculation ,",
    "the projected states obtained above are employed to diagonalize the shell model hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hamham ] ) .",
    "it is to be mentioned that for the discussion purpose , only the lowest three bands from the 0-qp configuration and lowest two bands for each other configuration have been shown in band diagram , figs .",
    "1 to 4 . however",
    ", in the diagonalisation of the hamiltonian , the basis states employed are much more , which includes , for example , those @xmath64 and 7 with @xmath31 and @xmath65 and 8 with @xmath28 .",
    "the lowest three bands after the configuration mixing are shown in figs .",
    "5 and 6 and are compared with the experimental energies wherever available .",
    "although they are of mixed configurations in our model , we still call them yrast , @xmath0- and 2@xmath0-bands to be consistent with the literature .",
    "it is observed from these two figures that the agreement between the calculated and the experimental energies for the yrast and @xmath0-bands is quite satisfactory . for @xmath66er ,",
    "the theoretical yrast line depicts two slopes and these correspond to the slopes of two crossing bands shown in figs . 1 and 4 .",
    "this also indicates that the interaction between the two crossing bands is small with the result that these nuclei shall depict a back - bending effect @xcite .",
    "it is also encouraging to note from figs .",
    "5 and 6 that the agreement for the @xmath0-bands is quite good , except that for @xmath59er and @xmath63er , the signature splitting at the top of the bands is not reproduced properly . for the 2@xmath0-bands , our calculations agree well with the only available data in @xmath60er @xcite and @xmath62er @xcite .",
    "there is another notable effect about anharmonicity in @xmath0 vibrations .",
    "if we regard the @xmath0-bandhead as one @xmath0- phonon vibration and the 2@xmath0-bandhead as two @xmath0-phonon vibration , it can be easily seen from figs . 5 and 6 that the vibration is not perfectly harmonic .",
    "in fact , in the two lightest isotopes , the @xmath0-soft @xmath1er and @xmath2er , the vibration is almost harmonic .",
    "as the neutron number increases , a clear anharmonicity is predicted from our calculation and the degree of anharmonicity increases with increasing neutron number .      in order to probe further the structure of the bands presented in figs . 5 and 6 , the wavefunction decomposition of the yrast , @xmath0- and 2@xmath0-bands are shown in figs .",
    "7 , 8 and 9 for @xmath1er , @xmath59er and @xmath63er . for other nuclei , the wavefunction have smiliar structure and are not presented .",
    "it is seen from fig . 7",
    "that the yrast band for @xmath1er is predominantly composed of the ( 0 , 0 ) configuration up to @xmath67 .",
    "the ( 0 , 0 ) contribution suddenly drops at @xmath67 , and ( 1 , 2n ) configuration becomes dominant from @xmath54 to 16 . for @xmath61 and onwards , there are many configurations with finite values contributing to the yrast states .",
    "the band diagram of @xmath1er in fig .",
    "1 suggests that the @xmath0-band should have the ( 2 , 0 ) configuration as the dominant component .",
    "this is evident from fig .",
    "7 and it is also noted that ( 0 , 0 ) is significant for the even spin states up to @xmath68 . the @xmath67 state is mostly composed of ( 1 , 2n ) and for higher spin states the ( 3 , 2n ) and ( 3 , 2p ) configurations are the dominant components of the @xmath0 band .",
    "the 2@xmath0 band in fig .",
    "7 is composed of ( 4 , 0 ) band for the low spin states .",
    "@xmath68 of this band is predominantly composed of the ( 1 , 2n ) configuration , but the high spin states are found to have quite a complex structure .    the yrast wavefunction decomposition of @xmath59er , shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "8 , indicates that this lowest band is predominantly composed of the ( 0 , 0 ) configuration up to @xmath54 and there appears to be very small admixtures of @xmath5 and other configurations . after the bandcrossing at @xmath51 , the yrast states are dominated by the ( 1 , 2n ) configuration .",
    "there is also a significant contribution of the ( 3 , 2n ) configuration after the bandcrossing .",
    "the @xmath0-band in fig .",
    "8 is primarily composed of the ( 2 , 0 ) configuration up to @xmath69 and above this spin the states are a mixture of different configurations .",
    "there is a clear distinction in the composition of the even- and odd - spin states above @xmath69 .",
    "the odd - spin states are composed of the ( 3 , 2n ) and ( 2 , 0 ) configurations , and the even - spin states are dominated by the ( 1 , 2n ) and ( 0 , 0 ) structures .",
    "the 2@xmath0-band up to @xmath70 is primarily the ( 4 , 0 ) configuration . for @xmath68 and above",
    ", this band is a mixture of ( 1 , 2n ) and ( 3 , 2n ) configurations .    the wavefunction analysis of @xmath63er shown in fig .",
    "9 indicates that the yrast state , as expected for a well deformed nuclei , is mainly comprised of the ( 0 , 0 ) configuration .",
    "this contribution drops smoothly and , on the other hand , the ( 1 , 2n ) component increases steadily . for @xmath71",
    ", it is noted that the ( 0 , 0 ) and ( 1 , 2n ) contributions are almost identical and above this spin value , it is expected that the ( 1 , 2n ) configuration shall dominate the yrast states .",
    "the @xmath0-band is also noted to have a well defined structure of ( 2 , 0 ) and only for high spin states , it is observed that the ( 1 , 2n ) and ( 3 , 2n ) of the 2n - aligned configuration become important .",
    "the 2@xmath0-band is dominated mostly by the aligning configurations above @xmath70 . as is evident from the band diagram of this nucleus , presented in fig .",
    "4 , that 2n - aligned band is lower than the ( 4 , 0 ) band for most of the spin values .",
    "in the present work , the triaxial projected shell model approach with extended basis has been employed to study the high - spin band structures of the er - isotopes from @xmath14 to 170 . in this model ,",
    "the hamiltonian employed consists of pairing plus quadrupole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "it is known that nilsson deformed potential is the mean - field of the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction and this potential is directly used as the hartree - fock field rather than performing the variational calculations .",
    "it is , as a matter of fact , quite appropriate to use the nilsson states as a starting basis because the parameters of this potential have been fitted to large body of experimental data .",
    "the parameters of the model are the deformation parameters of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the axial deformation parameter @xmath22 has been fixed from the observed quadrupole deformation of the system as is done in most of the projected shell model analysis .",
    "the non - axial parameter @xmath23 was chosen to reproduce the bandhead of the @xmath0 band .",
    "the pairing strength parameters have been determined to reproduce the odd - even mass differences .",
    "the monopole pairing interaction has been solved in the bcs approximation and the qp states generated . in the present work ,",
    "the qp states considered are : 0-qp , 2-qp neutron , 2-qp proton , and the 4-qp state of 2-neutron plus 2-proton .    in the second stage of the calculations ,",
    "the three - dimensional angular - momentum projection is performed to project out the good angular - momentum states from these qp states .",
    "these projected states are then used as the basis to diagonalise the shell model hamiltonian in the third and the final stage .",
    "the salient features of results obtained in the present work are :    1 .",
    "@xmath0-bands are quite close to the yrast line for the neutron - deficient er - isotopes , in particular , for @xmath1er and @xmath2er .",
    "it is further evident from the present results that these @xmath0-states become further lower in energies for high - spin states . as a matter of fact ,",
    "for @xmath1er and @xmath2er , they become lower than the ground - state band for @xmath72 .",
    "we propose that this is a feature of @xmath0-soft nuclei .",
    "@xmath0-bands are pushed up in energy with increasing neutron number , and further the degree of anharmonicity of @xmath0 vibration also increases .",
    "the wavefunction decomposition of the bands demonstrates that for neutron deficient er - isotopes , there is a significant mixture of the @xmath0 configuration in the ground - state band and vice - versa .",
    "the neutron rich @xmath63er nucleus , on the other hand , has the intrinsic structures as expected for a well deformed nucleus with the ground - state band composed of nearly pure @xmath4 configuration .",
