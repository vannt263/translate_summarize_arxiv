    "many physical and biological systems can be represented in terms of a collection of individuals governed by the competition of the two basic random mechanisms of birth and death .",
    "examples are widespread and encompass neutron multiplication  @xcite , nuclear collision cascades  @xcite , epidemics and ecology  @xcite , bacterial growth  @xcite , and genetics  @xcite . neglecting particle - particle correlations and non - linear effects , the evolution of such systems can be effectively explained by the galton - watson model  @xcite .",
    "when the death rate is larger than the birth rate , the system is said to be sub - critical : the population size decreases on average , and the ultimate fate is extinction .",
    "this occurs for instance for nuclear collision cascades , where charged particles are progressively scattered and absorbed by the medium  @xcite .",
    "when on the contrary the birth rate is larger than the death rate , such as for bacteria reproducing on a petri dish  @xcite , the system is said to be super - critical . in this case , the population size grows on average .",
    "however , because of fluctuations on the number of individuals in the population , a non - trivial finite extinction probability exists for the whole system  @xcite .",
    "a super - critical regime is typically found also during the early stages of an epidemic ( the so - called ` outbreak ' phase ) , where a fast growth of the infected population is observed , until non - linear effects due to the depletion of susceptible individuals ultimately slow down the epidemic  @xcite . in the intermediate regime , the population stays constant on average , and the system is said to be exactly critical .",
    "a prominent example of a system operating at ( or close to ) the critical point is provided by the self - sustaining fission chains of neutrons in nuclear reactors  @xcite .     branching brownian motions at four successive times : ( a ) @xmath0 , ( b ) @xmath1 , ( c ) @xmath2 , ( d ) @xmath3 .",
    "starting from a uniform spatial distribution at the initial time , the population later shows a wild patchiness due to the interplay between diffusion , reproduction and absorption . ]    in most of the models cited above , individuals also interact with the surrounding environment and are typically subject to random displacements  @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the fluctuations stemming from birth - death events and those stemming from diffusion will thus subtly affect the spatial distribution of the particles in such systems  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that at and close to the critical point fluctuations due to births and deaths become particularly strong  @xcite : the spatial distribution of the individuals , although uniform at the initial time , may eventually display a wild patchiness ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , with particles closely packed together and empty spaces nearby  @xcite .",
    "spatial clustering phenomena have been first identified in connection with mathematical models of ecological communities  @xcite , and since then have been thoroughly investigated for both infinite and finite collections of individuals  @xcite .",
    "non - uniform neutron densities in the reactor fuel elements ( which have been named ` neutron clustering ' ) might lead to hot spots , and thus represent a most undesirable event with respect to the safe operation of nuclear power plants  @xcite . in view of the relevance of neutron clustering in the context of nuclear reactor physics , in this paper",
    "we will investigate the spatial and temporal behaviour of a collection of neutrons undergoing scattering ( random displacements ) , fission ( reproduction ) and absorption ( death ) . as illustrated in the following , a prototype model of a nuclear reactor",
    "can be described in terms of a multi - type branching process involving an equilibrium between neutrons and a second species of particles , the so - called precursors  @xcite . upon fission ,",
    "a random number of secondary neutrons ( called prompt ) are emitted almost instantaneously .",
    "precursors are also created by neutrons in very small numbers at fission events , and decay back to neutrons after poissonian distributed times : such supplementary neutrons stemming from the decay of precursors are called delayed  @xcite .",
    "the central goal of this paper will be to show that the presence of the delayed neutrons , despite their very small amount ( typically less than @xmath4% of the total number of fission neutrons  @xcite ) , actually has a quantitative impact on neutron clustering and is very effective in suppressing the fluctuations that are usually observed in birth - and - death systems close to the critical point .",

    "[ reactor ] we will present a simple statistical model of fission chains in a nuclear reactor . then , in sec .  [ statistical_analysis ] we will discuss our findings for the physical observable of interest , namely , the average and the second moments of the total neutron and precursor populations . in sec .",

    "nuclear reactors are devices aimed at extracting energy from the fission chains induced by neutrons  @xcite . to fix the ideas , here we will roughly sketch the key elements of a water - moderated reactor . the nuclear fuel is basically composed of uranium , arranged in a regular lattice within a cylindrical steel vessel filled with water .",
    "a fission chain begins with a neutron emitted at high energy from a fission event on uranium ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the neutron enters the surrounding water and progressively slows down towards thermal equilibrium ( the so - called moderation phase ) .",
    "once at thermal energies , the neutron starts diffusing in the water and may eventually re - enter a fuel element of the lattice .",
    "then , the low - energy neutron can either @xmath5 be absorbed on the @xmath6 isotope of uranium , in which case the chain is terminated ; or @xmath7 induce fission on the @xmath8 fissile isotope . in this case , the collided nucleus becomes unstable : after a negligible time lapse , it splits into several fragments ( typically two ) and sets free a variable number of high - energy neutrons ( about @xmath9 on average ) , which are labelled as prompt , and a large amount of energy .",
    "the number of fissile nuclei in the reactor core is extremely large , and can be considered constant to a first approximation .",
    "the fission fragments are usually left on an excited state and may later decay by a @xmath10 nuclear reaction : the energy release on @xmath11-transformation is however in a number of cases sufficiently great to excite the product nucleus to a point where a supplementary high - energy neutron is sent out into the system  @xcite .",
    "since these extra neutrons are emitted after the decay time of the @xmath10 nuclear reactions , they are labelled as delayed ( as opposed to prompt ) . both prompt and delayed neutrons initiate new fission chains .",
    "the full spatial - dependent behaviour of the neutron population in a nuclear reactor can be fully assessed only by resorting to numerical simulations including a realistic description of the heterogeneous geometry and of the compositions of the core components  @xcite . however , for the purposes of this work we will introduce a prototype model of a nuclear reactor that is simple enough in order for the relevant physical mechanisms to be singled out , and yet retains all the key ingredients of a real system .",

    "we will neglect the energy dependence of the probability of fission and capture , and assume that fission can be modelled as a galton - watson reproduction process  @xcite : the parent neutron disappears and is replaced by a random number @xmath16 of identical and independent prompt neutrons , behaving as the parent particle , and a random number @xmath17 of so - called precursors .",
    "the precursors conceptually represent the delayed neutrons being in a ` virtual state ' before the @xmath10 decay of the fission fragments , which sets them free into the system .",
    "there exists a joint probability @xmath18 of generating @xmath16 neutrons and @xmath17 precursors at the fission event , the realization @xmath19 being possibly correlated  @xcite",

    "fission chains in nuclear reactors fluctuate in space and time due to the competition between neutron diffusion , births by fission and deaths by absorption . because of the interplay between these three key mechanisms , the neutron population ,",
    "although uniformly distributed in space at the initial time , may later display patchiness , a phenomenon which is known as spatial clustering .",
    "close to the critical regime , the typical fluctuations may even become larger than the typical local neutron density , and thus make the average system behaviour meaningless .",
    "nuclear reactors operated close to the critical point require that the population of prompt neutrons instantaneously emitted at fission events must be in equilibrium with the much smaller population of delayed neutrons , emitted after poissonian times by the nuclear decay of the fissioned nuclei ( the so - called precursors ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath51 between the rate at which precursors disappear by giving rise to delayed neutrons ( @xmath20 ) and the rate at which precursors are created by fission events ( @xmath73 ) plays a central role in determining the behaviour of the space - time fluctuations .",
    "we have first explicitly derived the asymptotic expressions of the averages and the second moments of the total neutron and precursor populations , which are initially at equilibrium with a ratio @xmath242 . in the presence of delayed neutrons induced by the decay of precursors ,",
    "the average populations evolve in time much less rapidly ( by a factor @xmath54 ) than for the case of a reactor with prompt neutrons alone .",
    "the normalized variance of the number of neutrons also evolves in time by a factor @xmath54 less rapidly , and its amplitude is further rescaled by a factor @xmath54 with respect to its purely prompt counterpart .",
    "this effect is due to the buffering effect of the precursor population .",
    "then , on the basis of these results , we have turned our attention to the case of the average spatial densities and the spatial correlation functions , for which we have derived the asymptotic expressions in the weak reactivity regime . not entirely surprisingly",
    ", we have shown that the smoothing effect of precursors observed for the total populations carries over also to these physical observables .",
    "in particular , the spatial correlation function again evolves in time by a factor @xmath54 less rapidly , and its amplitude is further rescaled by a factor @xmath54 with respect to its purely prompt counterpart .",
    "this physically means that the equilibrium between neutrons and precursors is actually key in quenching the neutron fluctuations at the global scale as well as the spatial clustering at ( and close to ) the critical point .",
