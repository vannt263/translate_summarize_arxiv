    "molecular dynamics has been proven to be a well suited method to investigate the dynamic and static behavior of granular matter .",
    "the concept of molecular dynamics was initially used to simulate the dynamics of atoms and molecules , i.e.  of particles without inner degrees of freedom .",
    "alder and wainwright who belong to the inventors of this method investigated already 1957 numerically the low density approximation of the entropy @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the one  particle probability density in momentum space ) in a hard sphere system consisting of @xmath2 particles  @xcite .",
    "there are applications of molecular dynamics in many fields of interest and molecular dynamics became one of the standard methods in computational physics .",
    "recent molecular dynamics simulations are of very high algorithmic complexity , and systems consisting of up to @xmath3 particles ( with simple interaction forces ) have been simulated ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . a very interesting overview on the historical development is given in the first part of hoover s book  @xcite .    in molecular dynamics of granular particles , sometimes called `` granular dynamics '' ,",
    "each of the `` molecules '' is a macroscopic body typically with a diameter of the order @xmath4 which has its own thermodynamic properties , i.e.  it has internal degrees of freedom and hence it can dissipate mechanical energy when it is subjected to outer forces . in some special cases as in simulations of planetary rings",
    "@xcite the diameter can also be of the order @xmath5 . in the most simple case",
    "one can express the inelastic nature of the collisions of the grains by introducing restitution coefficients which describe the relative velocities in normal and tangential direction @xmath6 and @xmath7 of two granular particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 after a collision as functions of the relative velocities before the collision @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath12 here the relative velocity is given by @xmath13 or , including the particle rotation with angular velocities @xmath14 and @xmath15 , by @xmath16 with the unity vectors @xmath17 hence the relative velocities at the point of contact are @xmath18 in general the normal and tangential restitution coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 are themselves functions of the relative impact velocities @xmath21 and @xmath22 . for the case that the particles are rough homogeneous spheres the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be calculated analytically  @xcite solving the viscoelastic equations of the particles . using this model",
    "one neglects the complicated interaction between particles during the collision .",
    "the approximation is justified if collisions are relatively rare events , i.e. if the mean free path between collisions is long and one can restrict the calculation to two  particle  interactions only . if a system is in this regime one calls it a `` granular gas '' .",
    "event driven algorithms have been applied in many papers , recently e.g. in  @xcite for an investigation of inelastic clustering of granular particles ( using constant restitution coefficients ) and by luding et al .  to simulate vertically shaken material  @xcite . for sophisticated implementations of such algorithms",
    "see  @xcite .    in many cases of interest ,",
    "however , the particles collide very often or they touch each other permanently , i.e. the system reveals static properties .",
    "examples for such systems are flows through pipes and hoppers , ball mills , shaken materials , sand heaps and many others . in the model proposed by cundall and strack  @xcite and haff and werner",
    "@xcite the particles feel restoring forces in normal and tangential direction , and they lose kinetic energy during the collisions .",
    "if the particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 at the positions @xmath25 and @xmath26 with radiuses @xmath27 and @xmath28 touch each other they feel the force @xmath29 with @xmath30 @xmath31 is the young modulus , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the damping coefficients in normal and tangential direction and @xmath34 is the coulomb friction coefficient .",
    "( [ surfvelocity ] ) describes the relative velocity of the surfaces of the particles at the point of contact and eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) gives the effective mass .",
    "( [ ftang ] ) takes the coulomb friction law into account , saying that two particles slide on top of each other if the shear force overcomes @xmath34 times the normal force .",
    "( [ fnormal ] ) comes from the hertz law @xcite for the force between two rigid spheres which are in contact with each other .",
    "this model has been successfully applied to simulate the behavior of dry granular material in many works describing various physical phenomena .",
    "it developed to the standard method for calculations of granular dynamics .",
    "some of these problems are size segregation and convection in vibrated material in two and three dimensions ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the flow in hoppers ( e.g.  @xcite ) and pipes ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the flow in rotating cylinders ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the motion of granular material on an inclined surface  @xcite , sound propagation in granular material  @xcite , the onset of turbulence  @xcite and many others .",
    "many experimental results of many authors could be reproduced numerically using this type of molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "there have been developed very efficient algorithms for the case of short range interaction with large force gradients as it is typical for granular materials , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the model by cundall and strack yields reliable results in more dynamic systems , i.e. when the static friction of the particles does not play a major role .",
    "when the static properties of the material govern the behavior , however , the model might fail . in  @xcite",
    "is shown that one can not build up a stable sand heap with a finite inclination of such particles but the heap dissolves under its own mass and the angle becomes smaller with rising number of particles .",
    "lee  @xcite simulated static friction effects using spheres which are connected by springs .",
    "when two particles touch each other for a certain time a spring `` grows '' between these particles and keeps the particles together when forces are applied which would separate them .",
    "when the separating forces become too large the springs break and the particles move freely . using this model lee",
    "reproduced the finite angle of repose in a sand heap , however , the growing and breaking springs have no direct equivalent in nature , and hence the model seems to be quite artificial .    another simulation method which corresponds to the previous one for the case of very large damping has been introduced by visscher and bolsterli  @xcite . in each iteration step",
    "all of the grains are moved according to the motion of a vessel containing the granular material .",
    "then the particles are released one by one , beginning with the lowest one ( with respect to the direction of gravity ) .",
    "each particle moves until it reaches the next local minimum of the potential energy when it hits either the wall or other previously released grains .",
    "when a particle reached its local minimum it stays in that position , i.e.  a falling particle can not cause the motion of another previously released particle .",
    "this behavior means that inertia of the moving particles is neglected as soon as they hit another particle or the wall , and hence it corresponds to the case of very large damping .",
    "the advantage of this algorithm is its numerical simplicity , i.e.  it is possible to investigate much larger systems than using molecular dynamics .",
    "recently it has been applied in simulations of several problems as size segregation  @xcite and the motion of particles in a rotating cylinder  @xcite .",
    "obviously the simplification of infinite damping is not valid in each case , and hence one has to carefully investigate whether it is justified to apply this algorithm ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "there are some more simulation methods for the dynamics of granular material which we want to mention only : peng and herrmann applied a lattice gas automaton to investigate density waves in a pipe  @xcite .",
    "caram and hong investigated granular flows using a random walk technique  @xcite .",
    "there are some models to simulate complex shaped grains which are composed of spheres . in the model by gallas and sokoowski @xcite the grains consist of two spheres connected with each other by a stiff bar .",
    "walton and braun applied more complicated particles consisting of four or eight spheres rigidly connected with each other  @xcite . using this model they examined the transition from stationary to sliding flow and the transition from sliding to raining flow in a rotating drum .",
    "pschel and buchholtz  @xcite describe grains built up of five spheres where one of them is located in the center of the grain and four identical spheres are at the corners of a square .",
    "each pair of neighboring spheres is connected by a damped spring .",
    "the latter model was applied to the rotating cylinder @xcite and it was shown that the simulation results agree much better with the experiment than equivalent calculations with spheres . especially it was shown that one can reproduce stick  slip motion and avalanches which was not possible in simulations using spheres .",
    "the inclination of the surface of the material in the rotating cylinder and the dependency of the inclination on the angular velocity , however , did not agree well with the experiment .",
    "mustoe and deporter  @xcite proposed a particle model where the boundary geometry of the particles is defined ( in local coordinates ) by @xmath35^{n_i } +                \\left[\\frac{\\left| y_i \\right|}{b_i}\\right]^{n_i } - 1 = 0 .",

    "this requires an iteration technique which converges slowly for higher exponents @xmath36 and which makes hence the algorithm numerically complicated .",
    "hogue and newland  @xcite investigated the flow of granular material on an inclined chute and through a hopper using a model where the boundaries of the convex particles are given by polygons with up to 24 vertices each . to detect whether two particles touch each other one has to calculate the intersections between each pair of vertices . during collisions energy",
    "is dissipated according to stronge s energy dissipation hypothesis  @xcite in normal direction , whilst coulomb s friction law models the energy losses also in tangential direction .",
    "using grains which consist of interconnected spheres or of particles described by eq .",
    "( [ hogue.eq ] ) it is not possible to simulate particles with sharply formed corners .",
    "for some effects it seems to be essential to simulate such particles to reproduce the experimental observed effects .",
    "this point is discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "tillemans and herrmann  @xcite proposed a two dimensional particle model where the particles are convex polygons . when two particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 touch each other , i.e. when there is an overlap , there acts the force @xmath38 @xmath39 is the compression area of the particles ( overlap area ) , y is the young module of the material .",
    "the effective mass @xmath40 is given by eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) , the relative particle velocity is @xmath41 , where @xmath25 points to the center of mass of the particle @xmath8 , and @xmath42 is the characteristic size of the particle .",

    "only convex particles are allowed .",
    "this model was used e.g.  in simulations of shear cells , earth quakes and flow through hoppers  @xcite .",
    "the results differ significantly from similar calculations using spheres . for the case of the hopper simulation they found clogging and arching which could not be found in simulations with spheres .",
    "a similar model was used earlier by handley  @xcite who investigated the fracture behavior of brittle granular material .",
    "potapov et al .",
    "@xcite investigated a similar model for solid fracture .",
    "initially they subdivide a macroscopic two dimensional body into many small equilateral triangles ( elements ) .",
    "the forces in the body are resolved as forces at inter ",
    "element contacts of two different types which they call `` glued '' and `` collisional '' .",
    "glued contacts are the joints between elements interior to a solid body which can support stresses .",
    "when the tensile stresses exceed a certain value , cracks form and the glued bond breaks .",
    "collisional contacts are contacts between the surface elements of the body ( which eventually collides with other bodies or walls ) , and contacts between triangles in the bulk of the body where glued contacts have been broken . in the three latter models  @xcite",
    "the convex grains have been voronoi polyhedra in two dimensions  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a new particle model for molecular dynamics of granular material in two dimensions where the particles are simulated using a similar model which has some advantages . in the following section we describe the model , the forces acting between the grains are derived in sections  [ trianglessec ] and [ stressesinbeamssec ] .",
    "some aspects of the implementation and the performance of the algorithm are discussed in section  [ implementationsec ] and some sample results based on this particle interaction model will be briefly discussed in section  [ resultssec ] .",
    "in our model the grains are composed of an arbitrary number of ideal elastic triangles which are connected by beams ( see fig .  [ grainsfig ] ) .",
    "a beam in our sense is an deformable damped bar which is subjected to forces in the direction of its axis and transverse to its axis , i.e.  to normal and shear forces , and to moments acting on its ends .",
    "triangles which belong to the same grain do not interact with each other .",
    "when two triangles of different grains collide , i.e.  if there is an overlap between both , they feel a restoring force .",
    "hence the force acting upon the triangle @xmath8 belonging to the grain @xmath9 ( @xmath45 ) is @xmath46 the first sum in the first term in eq .",
    "( [ totalforceeq ] ) runs over all grains @xmath47 except the @xmath9th , the second sum runs over all triangles @xmath48 , the @xmath47th grain consists of .",
    "@xmath49 is the force which acts between the triangles @xmath8 and @xmath50 which belong to different grains @xmath9 and @xmath47 ( see section  [ trianglessec ] ) .",
    "the sum in the second term runs over all beams connecting the triangle @xmath8 of the grain @xmath9 with other triangles of the same grain .",
    "@xmath51 is the force induced by the beam @xmath50 acting on the @xmath8th triangle of the grain @xmath9 .",
    "they originate from the distortion of the beam that connects the triangle @xmath8 with another one of the same grain .",
    "the acting forces and momenta will be discussed below in section  [ stressesinbeamssec ] .",
    "a similar model for the beam forces has been introduced earlier by herrmann et al . for the fracture of disordered lattices  @xcite .",
    "the last term @xmath52 describes the action of an external force , as e.g.  gravity , on the triangles .    during its deformation a beam",
    "dissipates energy similar to a linearly damped spring , i.e.  proportional to its deformation rate  ( see section  [ stressesinbeamssec ] ) . to avoid time consuming calculations due to steiner s law each beam",
    "is fixed at both ends in the center of mass points of the triangles it connects .",
    "when the beam is not deformed by eventually applied forces ( the beam is at rest ) it is perpendicular to the neighboring edges of the triangles which it connects .",
    "[ grainsfig ] shows some examples of grains .",
    "the only restriction concerning the number , the shape and the position of the triangles is caused by the condition that the beams are fixed in the center of mass .    the next section  [ trianglessec ] gives a detailed description of the force that acts when triangles collide , in section  [ stressesinbeamssec ] the forces due to deformed beams are derived .",
    "in this section we describe the calculation of the term @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ totalforceeq ] ) originating from the compression of two triangles @xmath8 and @xmath50 which belong to the grains @xmath9 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "when the triangles are compressed there exists a virtual `` overlap area '' which leads to an elastic restoring force @xmath53 . for simplicity here and",
    "in the following we drop the upper indexes of the variables .",

    "[ standard.fig ] shows the most frequently found type of a collision between the triangles @xmath58 and @xmath59 , i.e.  a corner of one triangle deforms a side of another one .    the absolute value of the restoring force @xmath53 is given by the shadowed area @xmath60 of the triangle @xmath61 times the young module @xmath31 .",
    "its direction is perpendicular to the intersection line @xmath62 ( poisson hypothesis , see e.g.  @xcite ) . hence resulting momenta acting upon the triangles @xmath58 and @xmath59 read @xmath63 the vector @xmath64 points from the middle point of the line @xmath62 to the center of mass of the triangle @xmath58 .",
    "although the case shown in fig .",
    "[ standard.fig ] is the mostly occurring type of collisions there are several other types which treatment has to be discussed below .    classifying the possible interactions of the triangles we define five different types of collisions which are slightly different from those in  @xcite .",
    "the detection of overlapping polygons is a very important problem in computer graphics too , where one frequently has to decide whether two objects cover each other , and which of them is in the foreground or in the background , respectively .",
    "therefore we found it helpful and inspiring first to have a look into advanced methods in computer graphics , e.g.  @xcite . in all figures  [ standard.fig][schnit5 ] the overlapping area",
    "is drawn extremely exaggerated .",
    "typically the overlapping area of two interacting triangles does not exceed a few tenth of a percent of the area of the triangles .    1 .   for the first type ( fig .",
    "[ schnit1 ] ) there are two intersection points @xmath65 and @xmath66 lying at the same edge of one of the interacting triangles .",
    "one of the situations drawn in fig .",
    "[ schnit1 ] corresponds to the standard collision ( fig .",
    "[ standard.fig ] ) .",
    "we calculate the area @xmath67 ( shadowed area ) given by the intersection points @xmath65 and @xmath66 and the included point @xmath68 .",
    "because the overlapping area is definitely smaller than half the area of the triangles the force is proportional to the minimum between @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xmath71 the force acts perpendicular to the line between the intersection points @xmath72 .",
    "2 .   the second type ( fig .  [ schnit2 ] ) is characterised by two intersection points lying on different edges for both triangles .",

    "the third type ( fig .",
    "[ schnit3 ] ) is characterised by four intersection points , each pair of two points lies on one edge of both triangles .",
    "therefore the third edge of both interacting triangles does not intersect the edges of the other triangle .",
    "there are two pairs of forces proportional to the quadrangular area @xmath76 of the overlap @xmath77 one acting perpendicular to the line @xmath72 and the other perpendicular to the line @xmath78 .",
    "factor @xmath79 is due to two pairs of acting forces instead of one for the first two collision types .",
    "the fourth type ( fig .",
    "[ schnit4 ] ) is characterised by four intersection points too , but here one of the triangles has intersection points at all its edges . because interactions of this type occur extremely seldomly we did not implement an exact calculation for this case , but we calculate two interactions of type @xmath80 with the intersection points @xmath65@xmath66 or @xmath81@xmath82 respectively , instead of solving the correct problem . in real simulation",
    "the fraction of this type occurs approximately @xmath83 of the number of collisions .",
    "nevertheless one has to deal with these extremely seldom events since otherwise they might cause problems from which the system can not recover .",
    "if one does not care about these events usually the system gains in a few time steps after the event occurs a huge amount of kinetic energy , i.e.  the system explodes .",
    "the fifth and last type of interaction ( fig .",
    "[ schnit5 ] ) is characterised by six intersection points",
    "@xmath65  @xmath84 .",
    "equivalent to the forth type we do not calculate the exact interaction but substitute this calculation by solving three interactions of the first type with pairs of interaction points @xmath65@xmath66 , @xmath81@xmath82 and @xmath85@xmath84 .    according to the forces @xmath53",
    "we derive forces in parallel to the axes of the cartesian coordinate system and moments @xmath86 acting with respect to the center of mass points @xmath87 and @xmath88 as described in equations  ( [ momentaa ] , [ momentab ] ) .",
    "when torques and forces are applied to a beam the beam deforms . since all deformations are assumed to be small compared with the size of the beam one can superpose the deformations originating from different applying forces and torques  @xcite .",
    "[ bending.fig ] shows an ( infinitesimally ) deformed beam with radius of curvature @xmath89 .",
    "we find the approximation @xmath90 with @xmath91 .    the dashed line @xmath92 is the neutral surface length of which does not change during the deformation .",
    "all other fibres below and above the neutral surface are in tension or in compression , respectively",

    "we assume that the beams have quadratic cross section of width @xmath101 and hence @xmath102 .",
    "when we express the radius of curvature @xmath89 by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the deflection of the beam from its initial position ( with the approximation @xmath105 ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ m = ei / rho ] ) and ( [ curvature ] ) one finds the basic equation for the deflection of a beam : @xmath106    this equation has to be solved to find the forces and moments which act when a beam is deformed .",
    "the integration constants are used to satisfy the boundary conditions .",
    "there are three different deformation modes for beams : elongation , shearing and bending . in the following three subsections [ elongation.subs ] , [ shearing.subs ] and [ bending.subs ]",
    "we will discuss the deformation rules in detail .      since the exact notation of the acting forces and moments as vector functions of the coordinates of the triangles the beam connects , is not very instructive but confusing due to the length of the formulae expressions we discuss for simplicity of notation the deformation of the beams here and in the following in local coordinates . instead of providing the exact vector notation",
    "we rather discuss absolute values . in all cases the directions in which the forces and moments act are very clear ,",
    "moreover they are given for each case explicitly in the figures  [ fig : beamatrest][beamdoppelt.fig ] and in figure  [ shearbend.fig ] .",
    "for the implementation of the algorithm , however , one should note that it is necessary to transform the given expressions for the forces and momenta into the coordinate system of the triangles .",

    "the deformation of the beams is damped proportionally to the deformation rates @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the damping coefficient of the beam material .",
    "as proven in the appendix the deformation of the beam is in linear approximation completely determined by the angles @xmath135 and @xmath128 and the length @xmath107 .",

    "during the collision of the triangles the energy is preserved .",

    "our model , however , is not restricted to this case .",
    "interesting phenomena are plastic deformation and wear which can be easily simulated by introducing thresholds for the beam forces and moments or for the deformations . when a force or a moment or a deformation , respectively , exceeds the threshold the beam breaks or deforms permanently .",
