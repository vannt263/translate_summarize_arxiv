    "the discovery of iron - based superconductivity @xcite with transition temperatures as high as 55 k @xcite has prompted efforts to understand both the electronic structure and magnetism of these materials , which are interrelated with superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the first class of iron - based superconductors reported , the 1111 family , derive from @xmath4feaso ( @xmath4 = trivalent lanthanide ) .",
    "they adopt the zrcusias structure @xcite , composed of layers of edge - sharing o@xmath5 tetrahedra alternating with layers of edge - sharing feas@xmath6 tetrahedra .",
    "a second class , 122 materials , derive from @xmath7fe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath7 = ca , ba ) with the thcr@xmath0si@xmath0 structure @xcite , which again contains layers of edge - sharing feas@xmath6 tetrahedra .",
    "the metallic parent phases in both classes undergo structural phase transitions from tetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry just above an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering temperature ( @xmath8 = 137 k for laofeas @xcite and  172 k for cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite ) with small ordered moments on the fe sites in the @xmath9 plane .",
    "superconductivity has also been observed in the binary iron chalcogenide systems : the properties of fe@xmath10te are very sensitive to the iron content @xcite and superconductivity can be induced by s or se doping @xcite ; @xmath11-fese does not order magnetically and undergoes a transition to a superconducting state at 8 k at ambient pressure @xcite , or 37 k at 7 gpa @xcite .",
    "recently , attention has turned to the potassium - iron - selenide phase diagram , in particular , k@xmath12fe@xmath13se@xmath0 , which adopts a vacancy - ordered thcr@xmath0si@xmath0 structure .",
    "this material is semiconducting @xcite and orders antiferromagnetically below 559 k. interestingly , the ordered fe@xmath14 moments are large ( 3.31 @xmath15 ) and are oriented perpendicular to the layer , in contrast to the 1111 and 122 materials @xcite .    the magnetism of the iron sublattice in these materials has been the focus of much study in recent years .",
    "initial studies on the 1111 and 122 materials suggested that the observed stripe magnetic ordering ( ferromagnetic stripes along [ 010 ] in the orthorhombic unit cell ) @xcite arises from the competing nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) afm interactions @xcite .",
    "subsequent work has highlighted the roles of other factors which lead to the complexity of the magnetic phase diagram for these materials @xcite .    in @xmath4feaso and @xmath4mnaso materials ,",
    "the @xmath16 ions have a significant role not only in tuning the superconducting transition temperature in the doped phases ( e.g. @xmath17 = 26 k for lafeaso@xmath2f@xmath18 @xcite , and 55 k for smfeaso@xmath2f@xmath18 @xcite ) , but also in influencing the magnetism in the undoped parent phases .",
    "for example , the fe@xmath14 moments of cefeaso order antiferromagnetically in the @xmath9 plane at @xmath19 = 140 k @xcite while the ce@xmath20 moments couple strongly with the fe@xmath14 moments at relatively high temperatures @xcite , before developing a long range order below @xmath213.7 k with moments predominantly in the @xmath9 plane @xcite .",
    "recent studies suggested some reorientation of the fe moments within the @xmath9 plane at the onset of the long range order of the ce moments @xcite .",
    "the ce@xmath20 ions influence the iron magnetic sublattice , and can also induce exotic properties such as kondo screening of the local moment in closely - related cefepo @xcite and cerupo @xcite .    the synthesis and crystal / magnetic structures of the iron oxyselenide ce@xmath0o@xmath0fese@xmath0 were reported in 2011 @xcite . it adopts a zrcusias - related structurein which the transition metal sites are half occupied by fe@xmath14 cations in a stripe ordered structure ( fig.[structure]@xmath22 ) . the magnetic structure of ce@xmath0o@xmath0fese@xmath0 ( fig.[structure]@xmath23 ) determined from neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) data reported rather surprising observations @xcite .",

    "analysis using isodistort @xcite suggests that the magnetic structure of ce@xmath0o@xmath0fese@xmath0 can be described by the @xmath52-centered space group @xmath53 [ bns : 15.9 with basis ( 0 , -1 , 1 ) , ( -1 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 2 , 0 ) and origin at ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) ] shown in figure[structure]@xmath23 and refinement using 4 k data gives moments of 3.14(8 ) @xmath15 and 1.14(4 ) @xmath15 for fe and ce sites , respectively .",

    "it is significantly larger than that observed in @xmath4feaso materials with poor metallic behavior ( e.g. 0.94(3 ) @xmath15 for cefeaso at 1.7 k @xcite ) .",

    "the crossover between 2d and 3d universality classes has been suggested to originate from a coupling to an orbital degree of freedom @xcite or the prroximity of a lifshitz point ( see , for example , fe@xmath10te @xcite and bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite ) .    the unusual change in the relative intensities of the different magnetic bragg reflections observed on cooling ce@xmath0o@xmath0fese@xmath0 ( fig.[peaks ] )",
    "can be rationalised in terms of the contribution of the ce and fe moments to peak intensities .",
    "the magnetic modes that describe the ordering of both the fe and ce moments have the same basis vector @xmath39 = ( 0 @xmath40 @xmath40 ) . as a consequence , the ordering on these two sublattices contributes to mostly the same reflections .",

    "low - energy fluctuations were studied to probe directly the fe - fe exchange along the chains .",
    "ce crystal electric field ( cef ) excitations were then investigated to determine the fe - ce exchange .    before discussing the scattering response from magnetic ions , we first describe how the background was subtracted from the powder averaged data .",
    "the measured neutron scattering intensity @xmath64 is proportional to the structure factor @xmath65 but also includes a temperature - independent background contribution due to instrument effects and sample environment .",
    "using the principle of detailed balance , we employ data collected at different temperatures to account for the temperature - independent background .",

    "a gapped excitation is observed near @xmath68 = 0 .",
    "the gap value is similar to that observed in other parent fe@xmath14 based superconductors such as fe@xmath10te @xcite and la@xmath0o@xmath0fe@xmath0ose@xmath0 @xcite and in 122 systems including bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite . unlike the crystal field excitation , this scattering is well - defined in momentum and decays quickly with momentum transfer , bearing a strong resemblance to the magnetic excitation observed in powder averaged measurements of la@xmath0o@xmath0fe@xmath0ose@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the temperature - dependence of this excitation is also different from that of the ce@xmath20 cef excitation : at 4 k , it has a gap of @xmath219 mev , which decreases on warming and softens into the elastic line by 115 k ( fig.[mari_scans]@xmath70 ) .",
    "based on these observations , we conclude that the low energy , low-@xmath68 scattering originates from the fe@xmath14 magnetic sublattice .    to separate the ce cef excitations from the fe@xmath14 magnetic excitations , the cef contribution was estimated by taking a cut over the momentum transfer range of @xmath68 = 2.8 - 3.5 @xmath71 , and then scaling by the ce@xmath20 form factor @xcite to estimate the momentum dependence .",
