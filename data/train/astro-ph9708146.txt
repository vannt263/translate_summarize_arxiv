    "initial results from superkamiokande @xcite appear to confirm indications from imb ,  @xcite kamiokande  @xcite and soudan  @xcite of an excess of @xmath0 relative to @xmath1 in the atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "one possible interpretation is that neutrino flavor oscillations play a role . in a two  flavor mixing scheme , for example",
    ", the probability that a neutrino of flavor @xmath2 and energy @xmath3 retains its identity after propagating a distance @xmath4 in vacuum is @xcite @xmath5,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the difference in mass squared of the two neutrino mass eigenstates and @xmath7 is the mixing angle .",
    "therefore , to evaluate the manifestation of the mixing in a detector that measures to some degree the direction and energy of neutrino - induced events , one needs to know the distributions of production heights of the neutrinos as a function of energy and zenith angle .",
    "more complicated mixing schemes  @xcite and effects of propagation in matter  @xcite still require this basic information about the points of origin of the neutrinos .",
    "information about origin of the neutrinos is implicit in any calculation of neutrino fluxes . here",
    "we extract the relevant information from the simulation of ref .",
    "@xcite , which has been compared to several other calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized in three sections .",
    "first we review the simulation we are using to calculate production of neutrinos in the atmosphere .",
    "next we present the basic results of the calculation .",
    "we discuss simple analytic approximations which offer insight into the systematics of the results and compare them to simulation results for zenith angles from the vertical to horizontal .",
    "finally , we provide some parametrizations , based on the analytic approximations , that may be useful for practical application of the results .",
    "the simulation was performed in the spirit of earlier calculations of the atmospheric neutrino flux  @xcite .",
    "the simulation code is one dimensional . in this approximation ,",
    "all secondaries are assumed to move in the direction of the primary particles ( except for a small fraction of low energy secondaries with angles larger than @xmath8 to the beam , which are discarded ) .",
    "the validity of this approximation has been checked in refs .",
    "@xcite .    the primary cosmic ray flux and its composition is the parametrization used previously in the calculation of agrawal _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which in the multi - gev range falls in between the measurements of refs .",
    "incident cosmic - ray nuclei are treated in the superposition approximation @xcite , with cascades generated separately for protons and neutrons in order to insure the correct ratios of neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "the fraction of neutrons is derived from the fractions of nuclei heavier than hydrogen in the primary flux .",
    "we consider three ranges of neutrino energies that correspond approximately to the three major types of experimental events in a detector the size of superkamiokande : contained events ; partially contained neutrino interactions and stopping neutrino induced muons ; and througoing muons .",
    "the energy ranges are presented in two different ways :    * @xmath9  gev ; @xmath10  gev ; @xmath11  gev and * @xmath12  and  @xmath13  gev .",
    "the integral form is more closely related to simple analytic approximations that we use as the basis of parametrizations of the results of monte carlo simulations .",
    "our results are obtained with the geomagnetic cutoffs for kamioka and for the epoch of solar minimum , which is applicable to measurements performed currently ( @xmath14 ) . because of the high geomagnetic cutoffs at kamioka , it is not necessary to account precisely for the phase of the solar cycle . to illustrate the potential influence of geomagnetic effects at other locations we also tabulate some results for the much higher geomagnetic latitude of the sno experiment .",
    "we have not included prompt neutrino production through charm decay because it is totally negligible in the considered energy ranges  @xcite .",
    "all neutrinos are generated either in pion and kaon decays or in muon decays .",
    "the production heights are stored separately for neutrinos from @xmath15 and from muon decays .",
    "the muon decay procedure accounts for the muon enegy loss during propagation in the atmosphere .",
    "technically the muon lifetime is sampled in the muon rest frame and then the muon is propagated in the atmosphere with time dilation proportional to its decreasing energy . thus mouns decay on the average",
    "sooner that they would have if one ( incorrectly ) sampled from a decay distribution using their lorentz factor at production .",
    "before presenting the results for neutrinos , we show a comparison between measurements of gev muons at different altitudes in the atmosphere and our calculation made with the same monte carlo code @xcite .",
    "this type of balloon measurement provides the most direct test of the validity of the cascade model and of the treatment of the muon propagation in the atmosphere because the muons and neutrinos have a common origin . the comparison shown in fig .",

    "contributions from muon decay and from @xmath15 decay are shown separately for @xmath21 and for @xmath22 .",
    "the overall flux of @xmath23 from @xmath15 decay is much lower because it reflects primarily the contribution of @xmath24 decays , which is very low in this energy range .",
    "the curves for electron and for muon neutrinos from muon decay are nearly equal .",
    "they extend to lower altitudes with a slope that depends on the average energy of the parent muons . for higher energy neutrinos",
    "this slope is signicantly flatter as a consequence of the higher parent muon energy and correspondingly longer muon decay length . for @xmath25 20 gev ,",
    "most parent muons reach the ground ( except in nearly horizontal direction ) and stop before decaying . as a consequence ,",
    "the height distributions for neutrinos from muon decay deep in the atmosphere are nearly flat .",
    "it is instructive to look at a simple approximation for the height of production of neutrinos from decay of pions . in the approximation of an exponential atmosphere with scale height @xmath26 and the approximation of feynman scaling for the production cross sections of pions in interactions of hadrons with nuclei of the atmosphere",
    ", a straightforward solution of the equations for propagation of hadrons through the atmosphere @xcite gives @xcite @xmath27 for the integral flux of neutrinos in the energy range @xmath28 where reinteraction of pions in the atmosphere can be neglected .",

    "the shapes are quite different .",
    "the production height for neutrinos from muon decay extend to much lower altitude because of the slow attenuation of the parent muon flux , an effect which becomes more pronounced as the energy increases .",
    "it is interesting to observe that at high zenith angles the yield of neutrinos from ( daughter ) muon decay exceeds the yield of neutrinos from the decay of the parent pions and kaons .",
    "the reason is that muon neutrinos from muon decay in flight have a spectrum extending almost to @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 ) , while the neutrinos from @xmath68 decay can only reach @xmath69 = @xmath70 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath71factors @xmath72 and @xmath73 are 0.133 and 0.087 respectively , including the effect of muon polarization in pion decay .",

    "at high neutrino energy the muon decay length becomes comperable or larger than the total dimension of the atmosphere .",
    "the neutrino height of production then becomes constant deep in the atmosphere .",

    "the calculation was done with the geomagnetic cutoffs of kamioka , except for the three lines ( @xmath52 = 1.00 , 0.75 and 0.50 , for the lowest energy bin ) that are also calculated for the high geomagnetic latitude of sno  @xcite .",

    "the height of production for neutrinos from @xmath15 decay grows slightly with the neutrino energy because higher energy mesons preferentially decay ( rather than interact ) in the tenuous atmosphere at high altitude .",
    "neutrinos from muon decay , on the other hand , are generated at lower altitude at high energy because of the increasing muon decay length .",
    "this second feature is much stronger because of the proportionality of decay length and muon energy .",
    "the average heights of production also reflect the relative yields of the two neutrino sources . for low energy @xmath85 , for example , the contribution of @xmath86 is small , so the average height of production is dominated by muon decay . at higher energy",
    "the relative contribution of @xmath86 grows , especially at directions close to the vertical , and @xmath87 becomes intermediate between those of the two processes with correspondingly larger width .",
    "generally the contribution from muon decay increases significantly with the zenith angle since even 20 gev muons easily decay in cascades developing in nearly horizontal direction .",
    "we have calculated the distribution of pathlengths of atmospheric neutrinos for a range of angles and energies relevant for current searches for neutrino oscillations with atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "accounting correctly for the pathlenght will be particularly important for neutrinos near the horizontal direction where the pathlength through the atmosphere of neutrinos from above the horizon is of the same order of magnitude as the pathlength through the earth of neutrinos from below the horizon .",
    "we have also given simple approximations that may be useful in interpolating the tables and adapting the results for different energy ranges and directions .",
    "the influence of the geomagnetic effects on the calculated height of neutrino production distributions is not very strong .",
    "the difference in the average production heights for neutrinos detected at kamioka and sno is of order several per cent in directions relatively close to the vertical .",
    "this difference diminishes with angle and becomes totally negligible for upward going neutrinos , where the geomagnetic cutoffs becomes approximately equal , being averaged over the geomagnetic fields of the opposite hemisphere .",
