    "experiments which seek neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite are only sensitive to a combination of neutrino masses and phases . certainly , extracting information on majorana phases alone from these experiments seems extremely difficult , if not impossible  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is worthwhile to consider other possibilities in the context of the htm .",
    "one method is the branching ratio of the doubly charged higgs boson to two leptons , br(@xmath111 ) , which is determined by @xmath112 and has been studied in detail in @xcite .",

    "consequently , one expects br(@xmath116 , and the predictions for @xmath117 and @xmath118 constitute a probe of such models .",
    "the distinctive feature of the htm is the prediction for the decays @xmath14 which are mediated by a tev scale @xmath8 , and the opposite hierarchy br(@xmath119 .",
    "the lfv processes we study are not mediated by the neutral scalar triplet fields because @xmath120 does not couple to charged leptons . in other models ( e.g.  the two higgs doublet model ) neutral higgs bosons can contribute significantly to lfv decays  @xcite .    in our numerical analysis",
    "the stringent constraint from @xmath3 is imposed , while @xmath14 and @xmath121 offer the possibility to observe a lfv signal in the htm .",
