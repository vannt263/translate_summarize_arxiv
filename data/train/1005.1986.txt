    "in 1952 , a. turing published a seminal paper  @xcite , demonstrating that differences in diffusion rates of reacting species can alone destabilize the uniform state of the system and lead to the formation of spatial patterns and suggesting this as a possible mechanism of biological morphogenesis .",
    "the turing instability and resulting patterns have subsequently been theoretically analyzed and experimentally confirmed for various chemical , biological , and ecological systems  @xcite ; they are generally viewed as a paradigm of nonequilibrium pattern formation . in 1971 ,",
    "othmer and scriven  @xcite pointed out that the turing instability is also possible in network - organized systems and this should be important for the understanding of multi - cellular morphogenesis . at an early stage of the organism development ,",
    "a network of inter - cellular connections is formed and morphogens are diffusively transported over such a network ; differentiation of cells may thus be induced by the network turing instability . on the other hand , many ecosystems represent metapopulations distributed over discrete habitats forming networks with dispersal connections  @xcite .",
    "prey and predator or host and parasite species may migrate over such networks with different diffusional mobilities .",
    "recently , diffusional spreading of infectious diseases over airline transportation networks has attracted much attention  @xcite .",
    "epidemic dynamics on the networks can be described by reaction - diffusion models where infected and susceptible individuals play the role of interacting species  @xcite . in all such network - organized systems with diffusional transport of interacting species , the turing instabilities and resulting nonlinear patterns",
    "can generally be expected .",
    "although nonlinear dynamics on complex networks is attracting significant attention , most of the investigations have focused on synchronization phenomena of oscillator networks ( see , e.g. , recent reviews  @xcite ) . despite the potential importance of network turing patterns and the large amount of research on classical turing patterns in spatially extended systems , very little research on this problem",
    "has been performed so far .",
    "early studies by othmer and scriven  @xcite have provided abstract mathematical framework for the analysis of network turing instability , but they explicitly considered only simple examples of regular lattices close in their properties to continuous media .",
    "recently , horsthemke _ et .",
    "@xcite have discussed the possibility of turing instability in coupled chemical reactors , but only for small networks .    in this article , we present the systematic analytical and numerical study of the turing instability and of the developing nonlinear patterns in large random networks .",
    "we find that the turing instability generally occurs in network - organized activator - inhibitor systems , but its properties are very different from those characteristic for the classical continuous media .",
    "classical activator - inhibitor systems in continuous media are described by equations of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are local densities of the activator and inhibitor species . here , the functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 specify dynamics of the activator that autocatalytically enhances its own production and of the inhibitor that suppresses the activator growth . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the diffusion constants of the activator and inhibitor species .",
    "the classical turing instability  @xcite sets in as the ratio @xmath7 of the two diffusion constants is increased and exceeds a threshold .",
    "it leads to spontaneous development of alternating activator - rich and activator - low domains from the uniform background .    in our study",
    ", we consider the network analog of the model  ( [ eq : crd ] ) , where activator and inhibitor species occupy discrete nodes of a network and are diffusively transported over the links connecting them .",
    "we consider a connected network consisting of @xmath8 nodes , @xmath9 .",
    "the network topology is defined by a symmetric adjacency matrix whose elements @xmath10 take values @xmath11 if the nodes @xmath12 and @xmath13 are connected @xmath14 and @xmath15 otherwise .",
    "diffusive transport of the species into a certain node @xmath12 is simply given by the sum of incoming fluxes to the node @xmath12 from other connected nodes @xmath16 , where the fluxes are proportional to the concentration difference between the nodes ( fick s law ) . by introducing the _ network laplacian matrix _",
    "whose elements are given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the degree of the node @xmath12 , diffusive flux of the species @xmath19 to node @xmath12 is expressed as @xmath20 , and similarly for @xmath21 . generally , diffusional mobilities of species @xmath19 and @xmath21 on the network are different .",
    "the equations describing network - organized activator - inhibitor systems are thus given by @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "here , @xmath3 and @xmath4 specify the local activator - inhibitor dynamics on individual nodes .",
    "we denote the diffusional mobility of the activator species as @xmath24 and of the inhibitor species as @xmath25 , so that @xmath26 is the ratio between them .",
    "the considered systems have a uniform stationary state @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this uniform state can become unstable as a result of the turing instability .",
    "if @xmath19 and @xmath21 correspond to the activator and inhibitor species , functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 should satisfy several conditions which are given in the methods section .",
    "as the examples of activator - inhibitor systems , we use the mimura - murray model of prey - predator populations  @xcite and the classical brusselator model  @xcite which are described in the methods section .",
    "this study is focused on the turing instability and pattern formation in large random networks .",
    "we use scale - free networks which are ubiquitous in nature  @xcite and the classical erds - rnyi random networks  @xcite , both described in the methods section . for convenience , network nodes",
    "@xmath32 are always sorted below in the decreasing order of their degrees @xmath33 , so that the condition @xmath34 holds .",
    "the turing instability is revealed through the linear stability analysis of the uniform stationary state with respect to nonuniform perturbations ( see methods for the details ) . in the classical case of continuous media  @xcite",
    ", nonuniform perturbations are decomposed over a set of spatial fourier modes , representing plane waves with different wavenumbers .",
    "as has been originally noticed by othmer and scriven  @xcite , in the networks , the role of plane waves should be played by eigenvectors of their laplacian matrices .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath35 and eigenvectors @xmath36 of the laplacian matrix @xmath37 are determined  @xcite by @xmath38 , with @xmath39 .",
    "all eigenvalues of @xmath37 are non - positive .",
    "we sort the indices @xmath40 in the decreasing order of the eigenvalues , so that the condition @xmath41 always holds .    introducing small perturbations @xmath42 to the uniform state as @xmath43 and substituting this into equations  ( [ eq : rd ] )",
    ", a set of coupled linearized differential equations is obtained . by expanding the perturbations over the set of laplacian eigenvectors as @xmath44 \\phi_i^{(\\alpha)}$ ] and @xmath45 \\phi_i^{(\\alpha)}$ ] , these equations are transformed into @xmath8 independent linear equations for different normal modes .",
    "the linear growth rate @xmath46 of the @xmath47-th mode is determined from the characteristic equation .",
    "when @xmath48 is positive , the @xmath47-th mode is unstable .",
    "the turing instability takes place when one of the modes ( i.e. , _ the critical mode _ ) begins to grow . at the instability threshold , @xmath49 for some @xmath50 and @xmath51 for all other modes . in the turing instability ,",
    "the critical mode is not oscillatory , @xmath52 = 0 .    as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the growth rate @xmath53 as a function of @xmath54 for the mimura - murray model . at @xmath55 ,",
    "three curves corresponding to different ratios @xmath56 of diffusion constants ( below , at and above the instability threshold ) are displayed . in this figure ,",
    "critical curves for two other values of the parameter @xmath57 are also shown .",
    "generally , the turing instability becomes possible for @xmath58 .",
    "the dispersion curve @xmath59 first touches the horizontal axis at @xmath60 and the laplacian mode @xmath61 , possessing the laplacian eigenvalue @xmath62 that is closest to @xmath63 , becomes critical .",
    "for the critical mode , the coefficient @xmath64 is positive , so that when the activator concentration increases , the inhibitor concentration also increases accordingly .",
    "explicit expressions are given in the methods section .",
    "note that the laplacian spectrum of a network is discrete and , therefore , the instability actually occurs only when one of the respective points on the dispersion curve crosses the horizontal axis .",
    "the above results are analogous to those holding for continuous media ( cf .",
    "the critical ratio @xmath65 in the networks is the same as in the classical case .",
    "the laplacian eigenvalue @xmath63 of the critical network mode corresponds to @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the wavenumber of the critical mode in the continuous media . despite such formal analogies , properties of the network turing patterns are very much different from their classical counterparts , as demonstrated in the following sections .",
    "when a turing pattern starts to grow after slightly exceeding the instability threshold , the activator distribution in this pattern is determined by the critical laplacian eigenvector , i.e. we have @xmath68 . therefore , to understand organization of the growing turing patterns , properties of laplacian eigenvectors should be considered .    as an example , figs .",
    "[ fig2](a , b ) display critical eigenvectors of a network for two different values of the diffusion constant @xmath57 .",
    "the same eigenvectors are shown graphically in figs .",
    "[ fig2](c , d ) . in the chosen representation ,",
    "network nodes with larger degrees ( hubs ) are located in the center and the nodes with lower degrees in the periphery of the graph .",
    "the nodes are colored red when @xmath69 ( e.g. activator concentration is significantly increased ) , blue when @xmath70 ( significantly decreased ) , and yellow for @xmath71 ( no significant change ) .",
    "it is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that spontaneous differentiation of the nodes takes place - the distinguishing feature of the turing instability .",
    "however , it affects only a fraction of all nodes .",
    "the differentiated nodes , with significant deviations of the activation level , tend to have close degrees",
    ". when the diffusional mobility @xmath57 is small , only a subset of hub nodes undergoes differentiation [ figs .",
    "[ fig2](a),(c ) ] .",
    "if @xmath57 is large , differentiated nodes have just a few links [ figs .",
    "[ fig2](b),(d ) ] .",
    "thus , a correlation between the characteristic degrees of the differentiated nodes and the diffusional mobility is present .",
    "the behavior observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is general .",
    "as we show below , it is related to the effect of localization of laplacian eigenvectors in large random networks .",
    "as has recently been discussed  @xcite , laplacian eigenvectors in large random networks with relatively broad degree distributions tend to localize on subsets of nodes with close degrees . the localization effect for a scale - free network is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . here",
    ", all nodes are divided into groups with equal degrees @xmath72 . for each group @xmath72 and a given laplacian eigenvalue @xmath54 ,",
    "the number of `` differentiated '' nodes with @xmath73 or @xmath74 in the respective eigenvector @xmath75 is counted . the density diagrams in fig .",
    "3 display in the color code the relative numbers of such nodes as functions of the laplacian eigenvalue @xmath54 and the degree @xmath72 .",
    "examining fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , one can see that differentiated nodes are approximately located along the diagonal of the density map .",
    "the localization effect is more pronounced for the larger network of size @xmath76 .",
    "similar localization behavior is observed for the erds - rnyi networks ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "thus , we see that each laplacian eigenvector @xmath75 is characterized by its characteristic localization degree @xmath77 . moreover , this characteristic degree is approximately equal to the negative of the respective eigenvalue , so that a simple relationship @xmath78 holds .    on the other hand ,",
    "as implied by the linear stability analysis ( see methods ) , the growth rate @xmath46 of each mode depends only on the combination @xmath79 of the diffusional mobility @xmath57 and the eigenvalue @xmath35 of that mode , i.e. we have @xmath80 . therefore , the laplacian eigenvalue @xmath62 of the critical mode @xmath81 with @xmath82 should be inversely proportional to the diffusive mobility @xmath57 , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "hence , modes with large negative eigenvalues @xmath35 tend to become unstable for the small mobilities @xmath57 ( note that @xmath84 in our definition ) .    combining the two relationships , @xmath85 and @xmath83 , a simple scaling law @xmath86 is obtained .",
    "it implies that the characteristic degree @xmath87 of the differentiating subset is inversely proportional to the diffusional mobility @xmath57 .",
    "the dependence @xmath88 holds for any activator - inhibitor model exhibiting the turing instability .",
    "the localization of laplacian eigenvectors has been observed by us ( to be separately published ) also for other random networks with relatively broad degree distributions .",
    "the characteristic localization degree @xmath87 of the critical turing mode is generally a monotonously increasing function of the negative of the critical laplacian eigenvalue , @xmath89 , and thus a decreasing function of the diffusional mobility @xmath57 .",
    "the initial exponential growth is followed by a nonlinear process , leading to the formation of stationary turing patterns .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of the system and the properties of emerging stationary patterns have been studied by us in numerical simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] presents typical results , obtained for intermediate diffusional mobility @xmath90 and slightly above the instability threshold @xmath91 for the mimura - murray model on the random scale - free network of size @xmath92 and mean degree @xmath93 .",
    "the nodes are sorted in the order of their degrees , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig4](d ) .    starting from almost uniform initial conditions with small perturbations , exponential growth",
    "is observed at the early stage .",
    "the activator pattern at this stage , fig .  [ fig4](b ) , is similar to the critical mode , fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , with the deviations due to the contributions from neighboring modes that are already excited to some extent .",
    "later on , however , strong nonlinear effects develop , and the final stationary pattern , fig .  [ fig4](c ) , becomes very different from the one determined by the critical mode .    observing the nonlinear development , we notice that some nodes get progressively kicked off the main group near the destabilized uniform solution in this process ( see video in the supplementary information ) . eventually , in the asymptotic stationary state , the nodes become separated into two groups .",
    "the separation into two groups occurs only for the nodes with relatively small degrees ( roughly @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) , while the nodes with high degrees ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) do not undergo the differentiation .",
    "our numerical investigations furthermore reveal that the outcome of nonlinear evolution depends sensitively on initial conditions .",
    "different turing patterns are possible at the same parameter values and strong hysteresis effects are observed . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) shows how the amplitude of the stationary turing pattern , defined as @xmath98^{1/2}$ ] , varies under gradual variation of the parameter @xmath56 in the upward or downward directions .",
    "stationary patterns observed at points @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) .",
    "as @xmath56 was increased starting from the uniform initial condition , the turing instability took place at @xmath102 , with the amplitude @xmath103 suddenly jumping up to a high value that corresponds to the appearance of a kicked - off group .",
    "if @xmath56 was further increased , the amplitude @xmath103 grew .",
    "starting to decrease @xmath56 , we did not however observe a drop down at @xmath102 .",
    "instead , a punctuated decrease in the amplitude @xmath103 , which is characterized by many relatively small steps , was found . reversing the direction of change of the parameter @xmath56 at different points ,",
    "many coexisting solution branches could be identified .",
    "the characteristics of turing patterns vary with their amplitudes . when @xmath103 is close to zero [ point @xmath101 in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) ] , only a few kicked - off nodes remain in the system .",
    "such localized turing patterns with only a small number of destabilized nodes can coexist with the linearly stable uniform state and are found below the turing instability threshold , for @xmath104 .",
    "to understand properties of the developed turing patterns above the instability boundary ( @xmath105 ) , one can use the mean - field approximation , similar to that previously employed in the investigations of epidemics spreading on networks  @xcite and for the networks of phase oscillators  @xcite .",
    "we start by writing equations  ( [ eq : rd ] ) in the form @xmath106 where local fields felt by each node , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , are introduced .",
    "these local fields are further approximated as @xmath109 and @xmath110 , where _ global mean fields _ are defined by @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the weights @xmath113 take into account the difference in contributions of different nodes to the global mean field , depending on their degrees ( cf .",
    "thus , the local fields are taken to be proportional to the degree of a node , ignoring the details of its actual connections .    with this approximation ,",
    "the individual activator - inhibitor system on each node interacts only with the global mean fields , and its dynamics is described by @xmath114 we have dropped here the index @xmath12 , since all nodes obey the same equations , and introduced the parameter @xmath115 . if diffusion ratio @xmath56 is fixed and the global mean fields @xmath116 and @xmath117 are given , the parameter @xmath118 plays the role of a bifurcation parameter that controls the dynamics of each node .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : single ] ) have a single stable fixed point when @xmath119 ( i.e. @xmath120 ) , and , as @xmath118 is increased , this system typically undergoes a saddle - node bifurcation that gives rise to a new stable fixed point .    as an example , we have computed stationary turing patterns for the mimura - murray model by numerical integration of equations  ( [ eq : rd ] ) and determined the respective global mean fields @xmath116 and @xmath117 at @xmath121 and @xmath122 . substituting these computed global mean",
    "fields into equations  ( [ eq : single ] ) , bifurcation diagrams for a single node have been obtained ( solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( a , c ) ) . in this example , one of the two stable branches vanishes by another saddle - node bifurcation when @xmath118 is increased further .",
    "these diagrams can be compared with the actual stationary turing patterns .",
    "each node @xmath12 in the network is characterized by its degree @xmath123 , so that it possesses a certain value of the bifurcation parameter , @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , the turing pattern can be projected onto these bifurcation diagrams , as shown by crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a , c ) .",
    "we see a relatively good agreement between the stable branches and the data from the actual turing patterns .",
    "furthermore , we directly compare in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b , d ) the computed turing patterns with the mean - field predictions , based on equations  ( [ eq : single ] ) .",
    "the turing patterns are well fitted by the stable branches , though the scattering of numerical data gets enhanced near the branching points .    in the supplementary information",
    ", a similar analysis is performed for the brusselator model .",
    "this model has a different bifurcation diagram in the presence of external fields .",
    "nonetheless , a good agreement with the predictions of the mean - field theory is again observed .",
    "thus , fully developed turing patterns in the networks are essentially explained by the bifurcation diagrams of a single node coupled to global mean fields , with the coupling strength determined by the degree of the respective network node .",
    "the mean - field theory is generally not applicable for the localized turing patterns found below the turing instability threshold .",
    "the fingerprint property of the classical turing instability in continuous media is the spontaneous formation of periodic patterns above the critical point .",
    "our investigations of the turing problem for large random networks have revealed that , while the bifurcation remains essentially the same , properties of the emerging patterns are strongly different . in the networks , the critical turing mode is localized on a subset of network nodes with the degrees close to a characteristic degree controlled by the mobility of species .",
    "the final stationary patterns are much different from the critical mode .",
    "multistability , i.e. coexistence of a number of various stationary patterns for the same parameter values , is typically found and the hysteresis phenomena are observed . above the instability threshold , network turing patterns can be well understood in the framework of the mean - field approximation . in this approximation ,",
    "each network element is coupled to certain global fields collectively determined by the entire system , and interactions of the element with its neighbor nodes are neglected .",
    "the strength of coupling to the global fields depends on the number of links connecting an element to the rest of the network .",
    "the turing instability is also possible in regular lattices representing a special case of networks .",
    "an activator - inhibitor system on a lattice can be viewed as a finite - difference approximation for the respective reaction - diffusion problem in the space and turing patterns on the lattices should therefore have almost the same properties as in the continuous media .",
    "the divergent behavior , characteristic for large random networks , must be related to a difference in the structural properties of such systems .",
    "diameters of random networks are relatively small and nodes in such networks can not be separated by large distances ( roughly estimated as @xmath125 for the erds - rnyi and scale - free networks  @xcite ) . for comparison , a cubic lattice with @xmath8 nodes in the @xmath126-dimensional space has the diameter about @xmath127 .",
    "thus , a lattice with the same size @xmath8 as a random network and a comparable diameter @xmath128 must have a high dimension @xmath129 . in lattices with high dimensionality and short lengths ,",
    "turing patterns with many alternating domains are however not possible and just a few domains ( clusters ) shall be found , resembling what is indeed observed by us in large random networks .    because of their small diameters , diffusional mixing in random networks is strong .",
    "large random networks are , therefore , structurally much closer to the globally coupled systems than to the low - dimensional lattices . globally coupled activator - inhibitor populations have previously been considered and spontaneous separation of the elements into two groups has also been found in such systems  @xcite .",
    "there is , however , an important further aspect distinguishing random networks from the lattices or simple globally coupled systems .",
    "all nodes in a lattice ( or in a globally coupled population ) are equivalent and have the same degree ( number of neighbors ) .",
    "in contrast to this , random networks effectively represent strongly heterogeneous systems .",
    "they are characterized by broad degree distributions ( less broad but still relatively wide for the finite - size erds - rnyi networks ) .",
    "this heterogeneity becomes essential in the problems involving diffusion . under the same concentration gradients across the links , a node with a higher degree receives a larger incoming flux from the neighboring nodes .",
    "the heterogeneity is responsible for the localization of laplacian eigenvectors on the subsets of nodes with close degrees .",
    "laplacian eigenvectors of networks are known to play an important role in the synchronization phenomena .",
    "however , only the second and the last of such eigenvectors are significant there ( see  @xcite ) . in contrast , in network turing problems , the entire laplacian spectrum becomes significant . by varying the diffusional mobility of species , critical turing modes corresponding to different laplacian eigenvectors are realized .    in the present study ,",
    "a general framework for the analysis of network turing patterns has been proposed .",
    "numerical investigations , confirming the theory , have been performed for the ecological predator - prey mimura - murray model  @xcite and for the classical chemical brusselator model  @xcite .",
    "both models belong to the activator - inhibitor class .",
    "there is moreover a different broad class of models where the first species is characterized by autocatalytic growth ( i.e. , represents an activator ) and it consumes for its growth the second species which effectively represents a renewable resource ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in these systems , growth of the activator leads to the depletion of the renewable resource , which has an inhibitory effect on the activator .",
    "the considered turing instabilities should also exist in such other network - organized systems .",
    "the results of our study may be important in a broad range of applications .",
    "turing instabilities can generally be expected in various cellular , ecological or epidemic networks in nature and their detection and observation represent a major scientific challenge . with the progress in engineering of synthetic ecosystems  @xcite",
    ", artificial ecological networks exhibiting turing patterns can be designed in the future .",
    "since @xmath19 is the activator and @xmath21 is the inhibitor in equations  ( [ eq : rd ] ) , partial derivatives of @xmath3 and @xmath130 at @xmath27 should satisfy the following conditions : @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 .",
