    "quantum dots have been the subject of both theoretical and experimental research in recent years.@xcite they have been successfully created experimentally by applying lithographic and etching techniques to impose a lateral structure onto an otherwise two - dimensional electron system .",
    "these structures introduce electrostatic potentials in the plane of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , which confine the electrons to a dot region .",
    "the energy levels of electrons in such a quantum dot are fully quantized like in an atom , and therefore are also referred to as _ artificial atoms_. in such electrically confined quantum dots the confinement potential can well be represented by a parabolic potential .    in the present paper",
    "we study a new quantum dot system which is different from the usual quantum dot system : 1 ) the electrons are confined magnetically , 2 ) the confinement potential is inherently non - parabolic , and 3 ) the dot contains a finite number of electrons where the filling of the dot is a discrete function of the strength of the confinement ( magnetic field ) .",
    "this _ magnetic anti - dot _ can be realized @xcite by depositing a superconducting disk on top of a 2deg .",
    "when a homogeneous magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the 2deg , the magnetic flux lines are expelled from the superconducting disk due to the meissner effect , which results in an inhomogeneous magnetic field profile in the 2deg .",
    "note that this problem is related to the problem of type ii superconductors on a heterostructure , where flux lines penetrate the 2deg.@xcite between the flux lines regions of zero magnetic field are present .",
    "here we have the inverse situation in which we have a uniform magnetic field except for a local dot - like region where there is no magnetic field present .",
    "bound states are now possible in the zero magnetic field region .    such a system was discussed by peeters _",
    "_ in ref .   where preliminary results were presented for the energy levels of such a magnetic anti - dot . here",
    "we elaborate on this system and give a more detailed and complete study of the bound states of such a system and calculate also other properties of this system . in ref .",
    "the hall and bend resistance resulting from such a system was discussed in the ballistic regime and in ref .",
    "the diffusive transport of such a magnetic anti - dot placed on top of a hall bar was studied .",
    "solimany _ _ et al.__@xcite studied a limiting case of the present system in which the magnetic field was @xmath0 and they solved the classical and quantum mechanical equations for a magnetically confined quantum dot , and recently sim _ _ et al.__@xcite investigated the formation of magnetic edge states along with the corresponding classical trajectories . although both groups referred to this theoretical system as a magnetic dot",
    ", we think the name ` magnetic anti - dot ' is more appropriate in this case . here",
    "we start from the experimental realizable system , i.e. a superconducting disk on top of a 2deg , and calculate in sec .",
    "ii the non - homogeneous magnetic field profile induced in the 2deg .",
    "we find that the magnetic field profile is different from the one assumed in refs .   and . in sec .",
    "iii the energy spectrum of electrons in the 2deg near this magnetic field profile is calculated and compared with those of two circular model magnetic anti - dot systems .",
    "the filling of the magnetic anti - dot is calculated as function of the strength of the confinement . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the electron probability current and the induced magnetic moment . the optical absorption spectrum , i.e. frequencies and oscillator strengths , are obtained in sec .",
    "v. the results are summarized and our conclusions are presented in sec .  vi .",
    "the system we have in mind is shown schematically in the inset of fig .  [ fig : profile ] .",
    "we have a high mobility heterostructure with on top of it a superconducting disk placed in a homogeneous applied magnetic field @xmath1 . for convenience , we consider a very thin superconducting disk which is perpendicular to the magnetic field and a distance @xmath2-above the 2deg . because of the symmetry of the system , we use cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath3 ) and measure all lengths in units of the disk radius @xmath4 .",
    "we solve the following magnetostatic equations outside the disk    @xmath5    with the conditions that @xmath6 due to symmetry considerations , and @xmath7 on the disk surface ( z=0 ) .",
    "this problem is equivalent to the problem of liquid flow around a disk and was solved in ref .  .",
    "there the _ oblate spheroidal coordinates _",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 were introduced , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 which have the corresponding scale factors @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the surface @xmath17 is a disk of radius 1 in the @xmath18-plane with center at the origin . according to that solution",
    ", the magnetic field under such an infinitesimal thin disk can be represented as @xmath19 where @xmath20   \\right\\}. \\label{eq : potential}\\ ] ] using cylindric symmetry and @xmath21 , we arrive at the single non zero component of the vector potential @xmath22 \\right\\},\\ ] ] from which we obtain the perpendicular component of the magnetic field profile ( or from eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) using @xmath19 ) @xmath23 these results can be easily converted back to the cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath24 ) by inserting @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ] with @xmath27 in the above equations .",
    "the resulting magnetic field profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile](a ) for different values of the distance ( @xmath2 ) between the 2deg and the superconducting disk .",
    "notice that the magnetic field under the disk is very small due to the meissner effect , while far from the disk it becomes equal to the external magnetic field strength @xmath28 . at the edge of the disk",
    "there is an overshoot of the magnetic field strength , which becomes larger with decreasing value of @xmath2 .",
    "when the 2deg is further away from the superconducting disk , there is almost no overshoot and @xmath29 gradually increases away from the center .",
    "notice that in the latter case the magnetic field is nonzero and consequently the model systems of ref  . and ref .   can not be realized by using a thin superconducting disk .    before discussing the electron states in such a magnetic field profile",
    ", we will first consider two model systems which correspond to two extreme situations , but which contain the essential physics of the problem .",
    "the two models we consider are defined by the following profiles : 1 ) @xmath30 with corresponding vector potential @xmath31\\theta(\\rho-1)$ ] , and 2 ) @xmath32 , which results into a magnetic field profile with a delta function overshoot @xmath33 .",
    "the first model was used as the magnetic field profile in the magnetic anti - dot of the previous papers @xcite .",
    "the second model contains a magnetic overshoot at the edge of the magnetic dot ( see also ref .  ) , which models the real system for @xmath34 .",
    "this overshoot is due to the de - magnetization effects of the superconducting disk .",
    "the vector potential profile of these two models is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile](b ) together with the one resulting from the superconducting disk for two different values of the set back distance @xmath2 .",
    "in order to calculate the wavefunctions and their corresponding energy , we have to insert the expression for the spatial dependent vector potential ( @xmath35 ) into the momentum operator @xmath36 which results in the schrdinger equation : @xmath37 ^ 2 \\psi({\\mathbf r})=e \\psi({\\mathbf r})$ ] . due to the cylindrical symmetry of the problem ,",
    "the wave function can be presented as @xmath38 and the problem reduces to solving the 1d radial equation @xmath39\\right\\}r(\\rho)=0,\\ ] ] where the effective potential reads @xmath40    we solved this eigenvalue problem numerically , using the newton iteration technique and subjecting the solution to the following boundary conditions : @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the numerical results for the energy spectrum are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra1](a ) for the model without overshoot , in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra1](b ) for the model with overshoot and in fig  [ fig : spectra1](c ) for the real profile in case of @xmath43 .",
    "the different energy levels are labeled with the corresponding quantum numbers ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we found it convenient to express the energy in units of @xmath45 and the applied magnetic field @xmath28 in units of @xmath46 .",
    "these units are related to the problem of a particle in a box .",
    "for example for @xmath47 m we have respectively @xmath48 mev and @xmath49 gauss . from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra1 ] we notice that for small magnetic fields the energy is linear in @xmath28 and in fact we recover the landau levels @xmath50 for an electron in a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "the reason is that for small magnetic field we have @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the magnetic length .",
    "so the electron wavefunction is spread out over a large region and most of its probability is in the @xmath53 region where @xmath54 . in the opposite case of a large external magnetic field",
    "we have @xmath55 and the electron wavefunction is localized in the dot region where there is no magnetic field present .",
    "the problem is then similar to the one of an electron in a circular dot in the absence of a magnetic field and we recover the discrete energy levels which are determined by the zeros of the bessel function : @xmath56 and are plotted on the right hand side of the figure . in this case",
    "the energy scale is @xmath57 like for a particle confined in a 1d box .",
    "although the limiting behavior of the spectrum for @xmath58 and @xmath59 is very similar in all three cases the intermediate behavior turns out to be very different .",
    "indeed we see that the energy levels @xmath60 of the model without overshoot increase slower than linear with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "this is not the case when there is a magnetic field overshoot where there are a number of energy levels which for small / intermediate fields have a superlinear behavior as function of @xmath28 .",
    "this distinct behavior is made more visible when we plot the energy in units of @xmath61 as function of @xmath62 as is done in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra2 ] .",
    "this different behavior between the two cases can be understood by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : wavefunction ] , where the radial part of the electron wavefunction ( n , m)=(0,-1 ) is plotted for various values of the magnetic field strength @xmath28 in case of the model with magnetic overshoot . for @xmath63",
    "the wavefunction exhibits a maximum at @xmath64 . with increasing @xmath65 this maximum shifts towards the center of the dot .",
    "in case there is an overshoot in the magnetic field profile and when the maximum of the electron wavefunction is situated near @xmath66 , the electron energy will be increased which results in the local maximum in the energy as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra2 ] . from this interpretation",
    "it is easy to understand that when @xmath63 the maximum in @xmath67 shifts to larger @xmath65 with increasing @xmath68 .",
    "this behavior of the electron energy has important consequences for the filling of the dot . outside the quantum dot",
    "the magnetic field is @xmath28 and the electron lowest energy state is @xmath69 .",
    "an electron will only be situated in the dot when its energy is lower than in the region outside the dot . from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra2](a ) we note that for a dot without magnetic field overshoot at its edges there are an infinite number of states , i.e. the states with @xmath70 for @xmath71 , which have an energy less than @xmath72 and consequently the electrons will be attracted towards the dot . for the system with magnetic overshoot",
    "the situation is totally different .",
    "the @xmath73 state has an energy below @xmath74 and two electrons ( two because of spin ) will be able to occupy the dot . when we try to add more electrons to the system we see that for small @xmath65 the electrons will prefer to sit far away from the dot region where they have a lower energy , i.e. @xmath74 . thus in this situation",
    "the electrons are repelled by the anti - dot .",
    "increasing the magnetic field will bring the ( 0,-1 ) level below @xmath61 and then two more electrons will be attracted towards the magnetic anti - dot .",
    "this discrete filling of the dot is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : filling ] for the model with magnetic overshoot ( solid curve ) and for the superconducting disk case ( dashed curve ) with @xmath43 .    including",
    "the real magnetic profile does not alter our conclusions qualitatively .",
    "this is shown for @xmath43 in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra1](c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra2](c ) .",
    "we obtain some kind of intermediate behavior between the two model systems .",
    "the discrete filling of the dot is still present , which can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra2](c ) . nevertheless , the exact position at which the number of electrons jump to higher values is a function of the exact magnetic profile , and in particular depends strongly on the sharpness of the magnetic overshoot .",
    "this is why @xmath75 has to be very small , which can always be experimentally achieved , by making the superconducting disk large enough .",
    "the probability current distribution of the eigenstates is also different from the usual quantum dot case .",
    "when we rewrite the wavefunction as @xmath76 , the probability current is given by @xcite @xmath77,\\ ] ] where the first term is the well - known circular current and the second term is due to the magnetic field .",
    "for bound states the current vector has only an angular component @xmath78 which is independent of @xmath9 . the probability current distribution @xmath79 and the corresponding radial distribution function of bounded states with @xmath71 and different @xmath80-values ( indicated in the figure )",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : currentprofile1 ] for the three different cases . for @xmath81 no current flows inside the dot except for the realistic magnetic field profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : currentprofile1 ] ) , although it is very small .",
    "the @xmath82 states have a positive circular current which is larger with increasing overshoot of the magnetic field at the edge .",
    "for @xmath63 the current is circulating in the opposite direction and the magnitude increases with increasing overshoot .",
    "the maximum of the current profile moves closer to the edge with increasing @xmath68 .",
    "sufficiently outside the dot region the circular current is positive , irrespective of the value of @xmath80 . with the delta overshoot",
    "this is also true near the outside edge of the dot where the current distribution exhibits a discontinuous behavior . in the latter case",
    "the current intensity is a uniform decreasing function of the distance @xmath83 . for the case without overshoot , or",
    "when we have a continuous overshoot , the current is negative near the outside edge for @xmath63 .",
    "these results can be understood from classical trajectories of magnetic edge states circulating clockwise ( @xmath63 ) or counterclockwise ( @xmath84 ) along the boundary region of the magnetic anti - dot without overshoot ( cfr .",
    "ref .  ) and which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] for @xmath85 , @xmath81 and @xmath86 . for completion",
    ", we also included fig .",
    "[ fig : currentprofile2 ] , which is the same as fig .",
    "[ fig : currentprofile1 ] , but for the states with @xmath86 and different @xmath87-values ( indicated on the figure ) .",
    "now the radial part of the wavefunction has @xmath87-nodes which results in zeros in the circular current .",
    "note also that the current becomes much more strongly peaked near @xmath88 .",
    "the amount of current outside the dot also increases with increasing @xmath87 . because @xmath89 the current is positive irrespective of the value of @xmath87 .",
    "also the magnetic moment is different from the quantum dot case .",
    "the magnetic moment of a particular bound state @xmath90 is defined as follows : @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the @xmath2-component of the moment of the mechanical momentum @xmath93@xmath94 $ ] . for convenience",
    "we write the magnetic moment @xmath95 in units of @xmath96 , so we obtain @xmath97 which is plotted for various one electron states in fig .",
    "[ fig : moment ] for the three different systems . in the limit @xmath98",
    "we obtain the well known result @xmath99 : the magnetic moment is that of an electron in a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "notice that all states with the same @xmath87 but @xmath70 have the same moment in this limit .",
    "furthermore @xmath100 for all bound states with @xmath84 . for @xmath101 , the same result as for a circular dot defined by hard walls , i.e. @xmath102 , is obtained for the models with ( a ) and without ( b ) overshoot .",
    "thus the magnetic moment of the @xmath63 states changes sign with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "this change in sign occurs at a larger @xmath28-value when @xmath80 is more negative . although the extreme limits are the same , again the intermediate behavior is different for the three systems .",
    "as one would expect , the magnetic moment in the case of the model with overshoot reaches its @xmath59 limit at a smaller applied field , than in the case without overshoot . for small",
    "applied magnetic field we also observe oscillations in @xmath95 in case of a magnetic overshoot .",
    "the oscillatory nature smoothes out and disappears as @xmath28 is raised or when the magnetic field is smoother at the edge ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : moment](c ) ) . this behavior can be understood by the following picture : depending on the radial quantum number @xmath87 the radial electron density has @xmath103 maxima . for small magnetic fields",
    "the electron wavefunction is extended outside the magnetic anti - dot . with increasing magnetic field the position of the maxima and minima in the electron density shift , and",
    "when a maximum is at the position of the overshoot , the magnetic field has the largest influence , and consequently the magnetic moment exhibits a minimum . for a radial quantum number @xmath87",
    ", there will be @xmath87 maxima in the electron density which will shift through the overshoot at @xmath66 with increasing magnetic field strength @xmath28 and consequently @xmath95 exhibits @xmath87-maxima ( one is at @xmath28=0 ) .",
    "when a minimum of the electron density is located at the overshoot , the magnetic moment has a local maximum .    in the superconducting disk case",
    "the limit @xmath104 is never reached .",
    "in fact , @xmath95 slightly increases for @xmath105 , and we found @xmath106 for all values of @xmath28 .",
    "this is a consequence of the small magnetic field under the disk , which is always present as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] . with increasing applied magnetic field",
    "@xmath28 , this field grows continuously , which influences the magnetic moment .",
    "the oscillatory nature of the magnetic moment of the superconducting disk case is still vaguely visible in the low magnetic field region .",
    "for the present case of magnetically confined dots the confinement potential is not quadratic like it is often assumed for the case of electrically confined dots .",
    "this has important consequences for the optical absorption spectrum . due to the generalized kohn s theorem @xcite the long wavelength radiation couples only with the center of mass motion of the electrons in the quadratically confined dots and",
    "the absorption spectrum exhibits only two peaks . in the present case",
    "we observe coupling between the center of mass motion and the other degrees of freedom .",
    "transitions are only possible for @xmath107 like in the case of quadratic confinement , but the other selection rule @xmath108 is now broken .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oscillatorprofile1 ] where the oscillator strength @xmath109 for excitation from the ground state is plotted as function of @xmath28 .",
    "this becomes more visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : oscillatorprofile2 ] which shows an enlargement of the smaller oscillator strength region .",
    "consequently the absorption spectrum exhibits a larger number of peaks then in the case of a quadratic confinement potential .",
    "the transition energies as a function of the applied magnetic field @xmath28 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : transitions ] .",
    "the solid curves correspond to the transitions with largest oscillator strength , the dashed and the dotted curves are respectively for transitions with one order , and two orders of magnitude smaller oscillator strength .",
    "in conclusion we have studied the single particle properties of a magnetically confined quantum dot . when this is realized through a thin superconducting disk which is situated close to the 2deg of a heterostructure",
    ", the magnetic field profile exhibits an overshoot at the edge of the disk which leads to a superlinear behavior of some of the energy levels as function of the strength of the external magnetic field @xmath28 .",
    "the consequence of this behavior is a discrete filling of the dot as function of @xmath28 .",
    "the circular current of the electron bound states has opposite sign inside and outside the dot region for the @xmath63 states .",
    "these @xmath63 states exhibit a transition from a diamagnetic to a paramagnetic behavior with increasing @xmath28-field . because of the non quadratic nature of the confinement potential",
    "we predict that the optical spectra of these new dots exhibits a rich spectrum of lines .",
