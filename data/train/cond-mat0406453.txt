    "the recent observation of the kondo effect in quantum dots ( qd s ) , whose parameters can be tuned continuously , and which allow probing of various properties , @xcite has yielded strong theoretical efforts in this direction .",

    "this crossover has been described by the computationally demanding numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) approach .",
    "@xcite other methods to describe the crossover are the  conserving t - matrix approximation \" @xcite ( which overestimates the unitarity sum - rule ) , or the more limited  non - crossing approximation \" , @xcite and to some extent , quantum monte carlo calculations . @xcite",

    "electron - electron interactions are assumed to exist only on the qd , and we take their energy @xmath19 to be infinite . in our scheme , one first solves for the gf on the dot _ in the absence of the electron - electron interactions _ ,",

    "this ( spin - independent ) gf can be written in the form @xmath21 with the energy dependent ( complex ) self - energy ( se ) @xmath22 this is easily done exactly , for any finite network ; it only involves the solution of a finite set of linear equations . our approximate explicit expression for @xmath2",

    "somewhat surprisingly , this equation depends on the network parameters _ only _ via @xmath23 .",
    "although approximate , this expression allows for detailed systematic investigations of the kondo effect as function of the system parameters , on a variety of complex networks . even if sometimes only qualitatively correct , such systematic studies help to investigate new physical phenomena on a broad variety of mesoscopic systems",
    "furthermore , the dynamical mean field theory @xcite ( which was developed to address the physics of the periodic anderson and hubbard models ) iterates the local gf of the siam , which is calculated at each stage in terms of the effective se created by the rest of the lattice . since our gf",
    "is easily calculated in terms of @xmath24 , it is an ideal candidate for such calculations .",
    "we are not aware of alternative simple analytic expressions which obey the necessary requirements at both high and low @xmath0 .    in sec .",

    "one then terminates this hierarchy by decoupling out averages of operators .",
    "the latter are then found using the fluctuation - dissipation relationship , from the relevant gf s . in this manner ,",

    "an earlier application of the eom method solved the integral equations numerically , on the simplest interferometer geometry . @xcite    the above decoupling scheme produces an integral equation for @xmath2 , which generalizes that found in refs . and .",

    "is represented by a band with a density of states @xmath26 . in the broad band limit",
    ", the self - energy on the qd can be approximated by its value at the fermi energy , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 represents the width of the impurity state in the absence of interactions ( @xmath29 represents the approximately energy - independent dot - band coupling ) . in this case",
    ", our equations reduce to those discussed in the earlier literature .",
    "we emphasize again that even the solution for this simple case is new and non - trivial , since earlier work either did not have a close analytical formula or missed some correlations , leading to wrong results at low @xmath0 .",
    "as stated , our result for @xmath2 depends on the details of the general network only via the non - interacting self - energy , @xmath30 . to demonstrate the power of our result , we present here a few simple examples . section [ iv ] contains explicit results for the simple case of the siam , when the qd is coupled to two one - dimensional leads . for this case , we easily calculate various features of the kondo behavior , including the peak in @xmath31 at the fermi energy , the plateau in the conductance in the so - called unitary limit and the plateau in the  transmission phase \" at @xmath32 .    a second example , of the so called  t \" network , is solved in sec .",

    "all the other parts of @xmath37 can be arbitrary , but non - interacting : @xmath38 describes the network without the dot , and @xmath39 describes the coupling of the dot to the network .",
    "here , @xmath40 creates an electron with spin @xmath3 and energy @xmath41 on the site @xmath42 of the network .",
    "the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 represent tight - binding hopping matrix elements . in the absence of a magnetic flux , these coefficients can be chosen to be real .",
    "the flux then turns them complex , with phases which relate to the aharonov - bohm effect and with @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite    the main part of this paper concerns the above general hamiltonian , which assumes no specific details on the structure of the network .",
    "however , for some specific applications , it is convenient to attach a finite mesoscopic network to several semi - infinite leads , which connect to electron reservoirs .",
    "we thus divide @xmath46 into two parts , @xmath47 where @xmath48 has the same form as @xmath49 , except that the sum is restricted to sites which belong to the finite mesoscopic part of the net ( excluding the dot and the leads ) , and @xmath50,\\nonumber\\\\   { \\cal h}_l&=&-\\sum_{rs } j_{rs } c^{(l)\\dagger}_{r\\sigma } c^{(l)}_{s\\sigma}+h.c .. \\label{leads}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath51 are the indices of the points on the mesoscopic structure which are connected to lead number @xmath52 , while @xmath53 destroys an electron of spin @xmath3 on the site @xmath54 of the lead .",

    "when the network consists only of the dot and the leads ( i.e. @xmath60 ) then this has exactly the form of the standard siam model , discussed broadly in the literature .",
    "if all the leads have similar bands , then the electrons in the whole system also have a continuous spectrum in the range @xmath61 .",
    "all integrals over @xmath4 below will be thus over this energy band , and it is due to resonances in such integrals that we need to calculate the retarded gf at @xmath62 .",
    "from now on we return to the general hamiltonian , eqs .",
    "( [ h1]-[h4 ] ) .",
    "the eom for the retarded gf on the qd reads @xmath63 where @xmath64 from now on , we shall use the shorthand @xmath4 for @xmath62 , except where it matters .",

    "another way to represent @xmath74 is to start from @xmath75 , and then take the complex conjugate only of the hopping coefficients @xmath76 ( namely reverse all their phases ) , without touching @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , @xmath77    since @xmath78 is an infinite matrix , its inversion may not be trivial .",
    "formally , we can denote the eigenenergies and eigenstates of @xmath46 by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and then write @xmath81 however , in the examples it is useful first to eliminate the parts which involve the sites on the leads .",
    "examples for this procedure are presented in appendix [ a ] .",
    "the eom for @xmath82 ( with only on - site hubbard interaction on the dot ) does not involve gf s of more arguments : @xmath83 with three new gf s , @xmath84 the inhomogeneous term in eq .",
