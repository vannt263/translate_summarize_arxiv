    "low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) , defined as those with @xmath1-band central surface brightnesses , @xmath2 , fainter than 23.0 mag arcsec@xmath3 , appear to have followed a very different evolutionary history from high surface brightness galaxies ( e.g. , mcgaugh 1992 ; knezek 1993 ) .",
    "their stellar populations , stellar masses , current star formation rates , and other properties appear to differ significantly from their high surface brightness counterparts , and little is known about their corresponding dust properties",
    ". a better understanding of these differences is needed to understand how they evolved to their present state .",
    "it has been generally assumed , even though a population of red lsbgs has been discovered ( oneil et al .",
    "1997a ) , that they contain little dust , and dust reddening has not been considered an important effect ( e.g. , bothun et al .",
    "1997 ; bell et al .",
    "lsbgs have low star formation rates , with suspected modest bursts in the range 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath3m@xmath5yr@xmath6 ( e.g. , vallenari et al .",
    "2005 ) and low metallicities , with almost all lsbgs at or less than about one - third solar ( mcgaugh 1994 ; ronnback & bergvall 1995 ) .",
    "their low metallicities imply that the dust to gas ratios should be systematically lower than in their high surface brightness galaxy counterparts , and the fact that the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ; neugebauer et al .  1984 ) and the _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ; kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) were only able to detect two of these galaxies seems to indicate that dust is much less important in lsbgs .",
    "furthermore , any data acquired with these observatories would not have been adequate to characterize dust temperatures or spatial distributions .",
    "that dust plays a relatively minor role in the evolution of lsbgs is further reinforced by observations of highly transparent galaxies that appear to have multiple distant galaxies seen through their disks ( oneil et al .",
    "1997b ; p.",
    "knezek , private communication ) .",
    "this has been confirmed by a more detailed analysis of the dust opacity of lsbg disks in comparison to those of high surface brightness galaxies , where lsbgs appear effectively transparent ( holwerda et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "additionally , pickering & van der hulst ( 1999 ) attempted to detect dust in lsbgs using submillimeter observations from the jcmt with scuba .",
    "ten galaxies were observed , two of which were detected at 850@xmath0 with only one detected at 450@xmath0 .",
    "they combined their submillimeter data with existing _",
    "iras _ data , finding dust temperatures in the range 15 - 20k .",
    "none of their very lsb ( @xmath7 ) galaxies were detected , and they concluded that the lack of detection in the lowest surface brightness galaxies was consistent with previous lines of evidence that only modest amounts of dust could exist .    _ spitzer _ opens the opportunity to study any dust that may exist at low levels in lsbgs .",
    "the increased sensitivity relative to previous observations gives a higher likelihood of the detection of diffuse dust emission that echoes the lsbgs diffuse optical appearance .",
    "in addition , the resolution of the _ spitzer _ imaging instruments allows for analysis of dust temperature , mass , and spatial distribution in lsbgs not possible before , making it feasible to address crucial issues regarding chemical evolution and dust production .",
    "we present here the infrared properties of a small sample of lsbgs with the full suite of _ spitzer _ instruments .",
    "all _ spitzer _ observations presented here are part of the dust in low surface brightness galaxies guaranteed time observation program ( p.i.d .",
    "62 ) whose principal investigator is m. j. rieke .",
    "the galaxies in this sample were selected to be some of the brightest and closest known lsbgs , many taken from the work of pickering ( 1998 ) .",
    "two galaxies are high surface brightness , low metallicity isolated late - type spirals that are included for the purpose of comparison with the lsbgs .",
    "table 1 summarizes general information for each galaxy , with the lsbgs and high surface brightness galaxies separated by a line .",
    "the objects were chosen such that the infrared background cirrus was low , improving the chances of detection of the faintest emission associated with each galaxy , and with sufficiently large angular diameters for resolution with the _ spitzer _ instruments . here",
    "we briefly outline their main properties and unique characteristics .      _",

    "the mips observations of the lsbgs are varied .",
    "there are clear detections of all lsbgs at 24@xmath0 ( with the exception of the corrupted data of ugc5675 , as explained above ) , three detections at 70@xmath0 , and two at 160@xmath0 . of these detections ,",

    "a summary of this rough classification is given in table 3 , with lsbgs listed above the solid line and hsbgs listed below the solid line .",

    "aperture photometry was conducted on all _ spitzer _ images .",

    "the value of this constant was determined by masking stars in the foreground , then taking an average of all pixel values outside the aperture used for the galaxy photometry . for galaxies where the foreground contamination was particularly high , we used a large region surrounding the galaxy to determine a background value that included a sampling of foreground stars .",

    "galaxies that are undetected at the various wavelengths have 3@xmath14 upper limits listed in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "upper limits were calculated from the images themselves , using the mean value of the sky counts and adding three times the value of the standard deviation of the sky counts .",
    "the photometric uncertainties are estimated to be 10% at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath0 and 15% at 5.8 and 8.0@xmath0 .",
    "these values include a 3% absolute calibration uncertainty ( reach et al .  2005 ) , a contribution for scattered light in an extended source ( w. reach , private communication ) , and an uncertainty due to the sensitivity of the measurements to the background subtraction . the contribution of the scattered light is higher at 5.8 and 8.0@xmath0 .",
    "we do not perform aperture corrections on the irac photometry , which in certain limiting cases can be up to 25 - 30% for the 5.8 and 8.0@xmath0 bands . in our case",
    ", it is difficult to determine this correction for the mixture of point and extended sources seen in the irac images .",
    "we mainly use the 8.0@xmath0 images to establish the presence of aromatic feature emission in our galaxies , so uncertainties of this magnitude have no effect on our conclusions . the mips flux calibration uncertainties are 4% at 24@xmath0 , 7% at 70@xmath0 , and 12% at 160@xmath0 ( engelbracht et al .  2007 ;",

    "galex _ , 2mass , irac , _ iras _ , _ spitzer _ , and scuba data points .",
    "the emission by dust at the longer wavelengths can be modeled by an equation of the form    @xmath15    where @xmath16 ( @xmath1732mpc ) , @xmath18 is the mass absorption coefficient , @xmath19 is the planck function , @xmath20 is the dust mass , and the sum extends over the number of dust components .",

    "additionally , we see the broad emission features usually attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "the data show the four main aromatic bands at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath0 .",
    "the aromatic feature at 12.7@xmath0 is likely to be contaminated by the [ ne ii ] 12.8@xmath0 line .",
    "there are no spectral features detected in the malin 1 spectrum . despite the fact that _",
    "spitzer _ was not aligned on the coordinates given as the central nucleus of the galaxy , the large extent of malin 1 ensures that irs took data on some portion of the disk , and the exposure time is long .",
    "also , our photometry ( tables 3 and 4 ) shows the mid - ir excess to be very weak .",
    "it is likely that no aromatic features in malin 1 are detectable with irs in reasonable exposure times .",
    "the spectra for ugc6879 and ugc10445 were fitted with the publicly available idl tool pahfit , which was developed to decompose irs spectra of pah emission sources , with a special emphasis on the careful recovery of ambiguous silicate absorption , and weak , blended dust emission features ( smith et al .",
    "the spectra were first prepared for pahfit by eliminating points with negative flux or with low ratios ( @xmath26 ) of signal - to - noise .",
    "table 5 shows the fluxes or equivalent widths ( ew ) for the various features as given by pahfit .",
    "the 7.7@xmath0 complex is a sum of the 7.4 , 7.6 and 7.9@xmath0 features .",
    "pahfit does not calculate uncertainties on equivalent widths because it is difficult to compute uncertainities on the continuum of the spectrum .",
    "the errors given in table 5 assume that the fractional errors on the equivalent widths are the same as on the integrated features , and thus are lower limits .",
    "the temperature of the cool dust , t@xmath27k , found for ugc6879 , a high surface brightness spiral , coincides with that found for the starbursting dwarf galaxy ugc10445 ( hinz et al .",
    "2006 ) using similar data and modeling techniques .",
    "it is also in agreement with the submillimeter temperature estimates of such dust in lsbgs by pickering & van der hulst ( 1999 ) and with infrared and submillimeter estimates of the temperatures of other low metallicity environments such as dwarf galaxies ( popescu et al .",
    "2002 ; lisenfeld et al .",
    "2002 ; bottner et al .",
    "additionally , observations of normal - sized high surface brightness galaxies , including the milky way ( reach et al .  1995 ;",
    "lagache et al .  1998 ) , show that cool dust components exist , and it is becoming apparent that such a cool component is fairly ubiquitous across galaxy types ( see review by tuffs & popescu 2005 ) .",
    "the total calculated dust mass of ugc6879 of @xmath28m@xmath5 falls within the range found for normal high surface brightness spiral galaxies of @xmath29m@xmath5 ( e.g. , sodroski et al .  1997 ; bendo et al .",
    "2003 ) and is a factor of ten higher than the mass values for ugc10445 ( hinz et al .",
    "the cool dust mass value for ugc10445 is considered a lower limit due to the fact that mips data are insensitive to dust colder than t=15 - 20k .",
    "the scuba 850@xmath0 detection of ugc6879 allows us to better estimate the turnover of the sed .",
    "the better constrained fit puts somewhat tighter constraints on the dust mass .",
    "the hi gas mass to dust mass ratio found for ugc10445 was @xmath11500 ( hinz et al .",
    "this was found to be inconsistent with the mean value of the ratio for normal spiral galaxies ( @xmath30 ; stevens et al.2005 ) , although the uncertainty in the dust mass value was large .",
    "the total hi mass for ugc6879 is @xmath31@xmath32 ( sauty et al .",
    "2003 ) , giving a hi gas mass to dust mass ratio of @xmath33 .",
    "this value is consistent with the stevens et al .",
    "( 2005 ) mean value .",
    "popescu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) propose that cool dust in galaxies is heated by the diffuse non - ionizing ultraviolet radiation produced by young stars , with a small contribution from the optical radiation produced by old stars .",
    "this appears to be borne out for the high surface brightness galaxies , ugc6879 and ugc10445 , where the _ galex _ and 24@xmath0 images pinpoint the active star formation sites , and the corresponding 160@xmath0 emission traces the detectable cool dust .",
    "figure 5 shows the central @xmath1-band surface brightnesses for the sample versus the ratio of 24@xmath0 to 160@xmath0 flux density .",
    "the lower the central optical surface brightness for each object , the lower the this ratio appears to be .",
    "this implies that there are not large amounts of dust extinction ; no highly obscured star formation is uncovered at 24@xmath0 , and those galaxies with the lowest surface brightnesses , i.e. , without bright star - forming regions , are not detected at 160@xmath0 .",
    "the appearance of broad aromatic emission spectral features in the isolated star - bursting galaxies confirms the presence of dust grains indicated by the irac , mips , _ iras _ and scuba images and photometry and our dust modeling .",
    "aromatic emission is believed to originate mostly from photodissociation envelopes at the edges of star - forming regions that are bathed in ultraviolet photons , with some suggestion that b stars no longer associated with hii regions can also contribute to the heating ( spoon 2003 ; calzetti et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the cases of ugc6879 and ugc10445 , the high surface brightness galaxies for which we have irs spectra",
    ", we clearly see star formation regions indicated by bright clumpy regions in the 24@xmath0 images and the corresponding 8@xmath0 emission that presumably accounts for the aromatic features .",
    "in contrast , we see that the lsbg malin1 does not have dust emission at far - ir wavelengths , nor aromatic emission , which is not surprising , given the popescu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) model and explanation .",
    "malin 1 exhibits no active star - forming regions detectable at any of the wavelengths that indicate such activity . without those regions , uv photons",
    "can not heat any existing dust to emit at long wavelengths , nor can the envelopes believed to be the site of aromatics exist .",
    "that is not to say that dust can not exist in such an object , but simply that any such dust will not be heated and will not be detectable in far - ir images .",
    "this appears to be consistent with results for irregular dwarf galaxies , where aromatic emission is found only in the brightest hii regions or where there is widespread , intense star formation ( hunter et al .",
    "braine et al .",
    "( 2000 ) calculated an average star formation rate over a lifetime of @xmath34yr for malin1 of @xmath35 yr@xmath6 based on its @xmath36-band luminosity . from this value they used scoville & young ( 1983 ) to derive a far - ir luminosity and translated this to an expected flux density of @xmath11100mjy at the _ iras _",
    "100@xmath0 band .",
    "this was below the detection limit of _ iras _ and indeed was not detected .",
    "the longer integration times with mips now place that one - sigma upper limit at 160@xmath0 of @xmath1110mjy , with malin 1 still invisible .",
    "one explanation for this low ir luminosity is that the current star formation rate is far below the average over the life of the galaxy .",
    "additionally , simply scaling the two - component dust model for high surface brightness galaxy ugc6879 down to the 24@xmath0 flux density values for the lsbgs does not appear to fit their seds . a scaled model that fits , for instance ,",
    "a 24@xmath0 flux density of 0.018jy , would predict a 70@xmath0 flux density of @xmath110.4jy and a 160@xmath0 flux density of @xmath111.5jy .",
    "comparing with the measurements of ugc6614 shows 70 and 160@xmath0 outputs only @xmath1125% of these predictions .",
    "the 160@xmath0 output of ugc6151 also appears to be somewhat below the expected value .",
    "therefore , it appears that the emission at the longer wavelengths for at least some lsbgs is fundamentally different from that of high surface brightness galaxies and that they are not simply low - luminosity versions of normal galaxies .",
    "either lsbgs do not produce or maintain dust in the same quantities as other galaxies , or the dust is much colder and , therefore , undetectable in the far - ir .",
    "comparisons of the _ spitzer _ data for different lsbgs may also reveal differences in evolutionary history .",
    "figure 6 shows the ir seds of all the galaxies in the sample .",
    "while the two high surface brightness galaxies have similar seds from 3.6 to 160@xmath0 , the lsbgs show a variety of steepnesses between wavelengths .",
    "some have steepnesses from 24 to 160@xmath0 that are similar to the high surface brightness galaxies , while others are shallower ( ugc6614 ) , and some appear to turn over after 70@xmath0 ( ugc9024 ) .",
    "for instance , ugc6151 and ugc6614 have very similar far - ir flux densities , yet ugc6614 is much brighter in red giant light , as represented by the 3.6@xmath0 flux density , compared with ugc6151 .",
    "this may imply that ugc6614 formed stars at a much greater rate in the past , accumulating an old stellar population , while ugc6151 may have formed stars at a more constant rate over its lifetime .",
    "the relatively high metallicity of ugc6614 supports the hypothesis that its star formation was more vigorous in the past .",
    "lsbgs are generally metal - poor , consistent with the well - known luminosity - metallicity ( @xmath37 ) relation for other galaxies ( e.g. , de naray et al . 2004 ) . in figure 7",
    "we show the metallicities of the entire hsbg plus lsbg sample versus the absolute magnitude at 24@xmath0 .",
    "absolute magnitudes are calculated using the mips 24@xmath0 magnitude zero point of @xmath38 calculated by engelbracht et al .",
    "average metallicities are taken from a variety of sources in the literature ( de naray et al .",
    "2004 ; mcgaugh 1994 ) .",
    "others are calculated using the sloan digital sky survey - sky server .",
    "equivalent widths of optical emission lines such as [ n ii ] and [ o iii ] are available online , and we use those values in conjunction with the rough metallicity formulations of wegner et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and salzer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to obtain metallicities .",
    "metallicities are notoriously difficult to determine for lsbgs , and the variety of sources used to obtain them for this sample may inflate errors",
    ". however , figure 7 shows a weak correlation in the expected direction that higher metallicity galaxies have brighter absolute magnitudes at 24@xmath0 . to probe the physical properties of galaxies that may contribute to the lack of aromatic emission features , we calculate @xmath39 , a comparison of the contribution of 8@xmath0 flux with the shorter irac wavelengths defined as @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , which is the ratio of the 8 and 24@xmath0 flux densities , for all galaxies that are detected at those wavelengths ( see engelbracht et al .",
    "2005 and their figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "we show @xmath39 versus @xmath41 and @xmath41 versus the metallicity of each galaxy in figure 8 .",
    "the data points have large error bars associated with the photometry so that trends are difficult to determine .",
    "we see that the values for the lsbgs are consistent with those found for normal galaxies by engelbracht et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , occupying similar parameter space as their high surface brightness counterparts in both plots .",
    "most of our sample have relatively high 8-to-24@xmath0 flux ratios , so that the correlation of increasing @xmath41 with decreasing @xmath39 is not sampled by our galaxies .",
    "in fact , all the galaxies in our sample that are detected at both 8 and 24@xmath0 have @xmath41 larger than 0.2 , and all of the galaxies in the engelbracht et al .",
    "( 2005 ) with @xmath41 greater than this value have detected aromatic features .",
    "we see the same general metallicity trend as engelbracht et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , with lower metallicity galaxies displaying weak aromatic emission , that is , diminishing 8@xmath0 flux density relative to 24@xmath0 flux density .",
    "one explanation for this trend is that harsh radiation fields in low - metallicity galaxies destroy pah molecules ( galliano et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ; madden et al .",
    "this is unlikely to be the case for lsbgs , where the radiation fields are presumably not strong enough to destroy aromatics .",
    "another explanation is that there are not enough carbon - rich asymptotic red - giant branch stars necessary to create large amounts of aromatic molecules in low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "_ spitzer _ data on five low surface brightness galaxies indicate that a fraction of these objects contains modest amounts of dust , despite their low metallicities and apparent transparency .",
    "the lsbgs are detected at all irac wavelengths , and two are detected at all of the mips wavelengths . those lsbgs and late - type",
    "high surface brightness counterparts that have detectable dust appear to be the same galaxies that have the largest amounts of star formation , while those that do not have detectable dust are the most diffuse , least star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , malin 1 ) .",
    "one explanation for this is that any dust existing in galaxies has to be heated to temperatures in the range 15 - 20k by ultraviolet photons escaping from star - forming regions before being detectable at far - ir and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "the gathering evidence shows that modest amounts of dust can be created and maintained in a variety of environments and in galaxies of widely varying apparent formation histories .",
    "we also find that lsbgs exhibit less far - ir emission and greater variety in far - ir properties than is predicted by scaling related but higher surface brightness galaxy seds .",
