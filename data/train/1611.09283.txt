    "the usefulness of the concept of ecosystem engineers as organisms that change their environment by causing physical state changes in living or non - living materials @xcite is somewhat controversial since all species modify their environment @xcite .",
    "however , species that must modify their habitats in order to survive or that increase significantly their chances of reproduction and survival in the modified habitats certainly comprise a unique class of organisms .",
    "these benefits , in addition , are likely to alter their population dynamics , which may require the explicit incorporation of abiotic interactions @xcite .",
    "for instance , beavers ( _ castor canadensis _ ) are considered as model systems of ecosystem engineers @xcite , since the areas flooded by the beaver dams increase the distance they can travel by water , which is safer than traveling by land , and results in a net increase of their survival expectations @xcite .",
    "a key feature of the population dynamics of ecosystem engineers is that the growth of the engineer population is limited by the number of usable habitats , which in turn are created by the engineers via the conversion of virgin habitats .",
    "this feedback loop results in a density - dependent carrying capacity that is behind the peculiar dynamical behavior exhibited by these systems . to our knowledge , the first mathematical model of the population dynamics of ecosystem engineers that explicitly takes into account the interactions between the organisms and the habitats was put forward by gurney and lawton in the mid 1990s @xcite . in that model ,",
    "the quality of the habitats takes on three different discrete states : virgin , usable ( or modified ) and degraded habitats .",
    "the role of the engineers is to effect the transition from the virgin to the usable states .",
    "the modified state then transitions to the degraded state , which is unsuitable for occupation by the engineers . finally , the degraded state recovers to the virgin state that can then be reused by the engineers .",
    "analysis of the continuous - time population dynamics model shows the existence of fixed points characterized by the presence of all three habitat states as well as cycles in which the number of engineers and the number of virgin habitats oscillate out of phase @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we consider a spatial version of gurney and lawton model in which the engineers and their habitats are arranged in patches fixed to the sites of regular lattices .",
    "a diffusive dispersal stage ensures that a fraction @xmath0 of the engineers move from their birth patches to neighboring patches @xcite . by patch we mean a complete ecosystem composed of all three types of habitats as well as of the engineer population .",
    "hence our approach differs starkly from a previously studied patch dynamics model in which each patch represents an habitat state and only the transitions between the habitat states are considered , i.e. , the dynamics of the engineer population is not accounted for @xcite . to facilitate the analysis of the discrete patch model we make time discrete as well and replace the logistic growth equation of the original model by the ricker equation @xcite so that the spatial model reduces to a coupled map lattice @xcite .",
    "henceforth we will refer to the system of patches as metapopulation .",
    "we find that the diffusive dispersal stage influences the metapopulation dynamics only in the case the local or single - patch dynamics exhibits chaotic behavior . in that case",
    ", we find that for certain values of the dispersal fraction @xmath0 the chaotic behavior is suppressed and the dynamics enters a two - point cycle in which the engineer densities at each patch oscillate between high and low values , forming rich ( two - dimensional ) geometric patterns .",
    "another interesting effect of the dispersal is the avoidance of extinction , which is one of the outcomes of the local dynamics when the intrinsic growth rate @xmath1 of the engineers is large .",
    "in fact , the unexpected possibility of extinction of the population for large @xmath1 is a consequence of the density - dependent carrying capacity and the study of the spatial dynamics of ecosystem engineers offers a neat example of how multiple populations coupled by diffusive dispersal can eliminate or reduce that risk .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce our time discrete version of gurney and lawton model of ecosystem engineers and derive the recursion equations of the local or single - patch dynamics for the density of engineers as well as for the fractions of the three types of habitats . in that section",
    "we introduce also the equation the describes the diffusive dispersal stage of the engineer population .",
    "the local dynamics is then studied in great detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : local ] with emphasis on the stability analysis of the fixed points . the spatial model with the patches arranged in a chain and a square lattice",
    "is considered in sect .",
    "[ sec : spatial ] , where the dynamic behavior of the metapopulation is studied mainly through the analysis of bifurcation diagrams .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conc ] is reserved to our concluding remarks .",
    "here we build on the model of gurney and lawton @xcite to study the dynamics of a population of organisms that must modify their own habitat in order to survive .",
    "let us first rewrite the original , continuous - time model as a discrete - time model .",
    "we assume that the population of engineers at generation @xmath2 is composed of @xmath3 individuals and that each individual requires a unit of usable habitat to survive .",
    "in addition , we denote the number of units of usable habitats available at generation @xmath2 by @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath4 plays the role of a time - dependent carrying capacity for the population of engineers , we can use ricker model to write the expected number of engineers at generation @xmath5 as @xmath6\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the intrinsic growth rate of the population of engineers @xcite .",
    "what makes the model interesting is the requirement that usable habitats be created by engineers working on virgin habitats .",
    "more pointedly , if @xmath7 denotes the units of virgin habitats at generation @xmath2 , then a fraction @xmath8 of them will be transformed in usable habitats at the next generation , @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath9 is any function that satisfies @xmath10 for all @xmath3 and @xmath11 .",
    "however , usable habitats do not last forever and eventually decay to degraded habitats which are useless to the engineers . denoting by @xmath12 the fraction of usable habitats that decay to degraded habitats in one generation , we can immediately write an equation for the expected number of units of usable habitats at generation @xmath5 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 $ ] is the decay fraction .",
    "degraded habitats will eventually recover and become virgin habitats again . if we denote by @xmath15 the fraction of degraded habitats that recover to virgin habitats we have @xmath16 where @xmath17 $ ] is the recovery fraction .",
    "finally , the recursion equation for the expected number of units of virgin habitats is simply @xmath18   v_t +   \\rho   d_t .\\ ] ] we note that @xmath19 so that the total supply of habitats @xmath20 is fixed .",
    "this remark motivates the introduction of the habitat fractions @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 that satisfy @xmath24 for all @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , we introduce the density of engineers @xmath25 which , differently from the habitat fractions , may take on values greater than 1 . in terms of these quantities ,",
    "the recursion equations are rewritten as @xmath26   \\label{e } \\\\",

    "we will consider the function @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the productivity parameter , which measures the efficiency of conversion of virgin to usable habitats by the engineers .",
    "this function indicates that the engineers do not work independently on the construction of usable habitats , otherwise one should have @xmath31 .",
    "this is actually the situation for small population sizes , where @xmath32 , but as the population of engineers increases they begin to interact antagonistically since @xmath33 for all densities @xmath34 .",
    "we note that the antagonistic interactions among the engineers ( i.e. the production of two engineers is actually less than the sum of their productions taken independently of each other ) is a consequence of the condition @xmath35",
    ".    in fact , the abstract function @xmath36 incorporates , perhaps , the most interesting features of the system of engineers as , for instance , the collaboration strategies and the communication networks that allowed this class of organisms to build complex collective structures ( e.g. , termite mounds and slime molds ) , which may be viewed as the organisms solutions to the problems that endanger their existence @xcite .",
    "although the decay of usable to degraded habitats is probably density dependent , particularly if the degradation results from the overexploitation of resources , here we have modelled it by a constant probability @xmath37 .",
    "there are examples , however , that conform to this assumption such as the case of bark beetles that can not breed in old dead wood so that the usable habitats , namely , recently killed trees , degrade at a rate that does not depend on the presence of those insects @xcite .",
    "we refer to the system of recursion equations ( [ e])-([v ] ) as the local or single - patch population dynamics . by patch",
    "we mean a complete ecosystem , say an isle , with the three types of habitats and , possibly , a thriving population of engineers .",
    "let us consider now a system of @xmath38 patches , say an archipelago , and assume that the engineers can diffuse to neighboring patches .",
    "more pointedly , we assume that a fraction @xmath0 of the population of engineers of patch @xmath39 moves to the neighboring patches , so that after the dispersal stage the population at patch @xmath39 is @xmath40 where the sum is over the @xmath41 nearest neighbors of patch @xmath39 .",
    "assuming that the total supply of habitats @xmath20 is the same for all patches and dividing both sides of this equation by @xmath20 we get @xmath42 which describes the effect of dispersal on the density of engineers in patch @xmath39 .",
    "the density after dispersal then follows the local dynamics equations within each patch .",
    "we postpone to section [ sec : spatial ] the presentation of the complete set of equations , where the habitat fractions exhibit the patch indices as well .    in summary , for each generation the dynamics consist of two phases : a dispersal phase and a growing phase . in the dispersal phase ,",
    "a fraction @xmath0 of engineers in each patch moves to neighboring patches according to eq .",

    "the end of the availability of unexplored virgin habitats leads to a sharp drop on the density of engineers , which then enters the stationary regime with oscillations of limited amplitude .",
    "we note that fig .",
    "[ figav ] offers a crude way to estimate the mean speed of the colonization wavefronts as the ratio between the shortest distance from the center to the borders of the lattice and the time to reach those borders .",
    "finally , we should mention that we do not find any significant variations in the spatial patterns for different lattice sizes .",
    "in fact , as pointed out before the patterns close to the center of the lattice are formed well before the engineers reach the lattice boundaries .",
    "hence the particular geometric patterns observed in the square lattice are essentially a consequence of the choice of the moore neighborhood for the engineers dispersal .",
    "there are hardly any ecosystems on earth that have not been engineered by past or present organisms , as attested by the highly unstable , life - regulated composition of the atmosphere of our planet @xcite .",
    "however , the importance of ecosystem engineering @xcite or , more generally , of niche construction @xcite has been somewhat overlooked by the ecological and evolutionary literatures .",
    "for instance , within the theoretical ecology perspective , the population dynamics of predator - prey systems has been studied for almost a century @xcite , whereas a first attempt to model mathematically the dynamics of ecosystem engineers took place in the mid 1990s only @xcite .",
    "the interesting feature of the ecosystem engineers model proposed by gurney and lawton is that both the density of organisms  the engineers  and the quality of their habitats vary in time , as their survival depends on the existence of engineered habitats @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with less transparent models of ecosystem engineers where the habitat changes are not explicitly taken into account @xcite .",
    "building on the original model of gurney and lawton @xcite , in this contribution we study a model of ecosystem engineers that is discrete both in space and time .",
    "although the resulting coupled map lattice could describe organisms with seasonal reproduction living in fragmented territories ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , our main motivation to use this discrete framework is the easy to simulate the space - dependent dynamics .",
    "the analysis of the discrete model may motivate the study of the spatial system using more analytically prone approaches , such as diffusion - reaction equations @xcite and kernel - based systems @xcite .    as expected , we find that the local or single - patch dynamics converges to zero - engineers attractors whenever the number of usable habitats decreases more rapidly than they are produced by a vanishingly small population of engineers working on virgin habitats , i.e. , whenever the decay fraction @xmath37 is greater than the per capita productivity @xmath78 .",
    "a curious feature of the local dynamics , which is due to the density - dependent carrying capacity in ricker equation , is the existence of an oscillating zero - engineers attractor for which both the density of engineers @xmath34 and the fraction of usable habitats @xmath138 tend to zero in the time - asymptotic limit , but the ratio @xmath115 oscillates with finite amplitude .",
    "interestingly , the appearance of this attractor for large values of the engineers intrinsic growth rate @xmath1 leads to the extinction of the population even in an apparently thriving scenario where @xmath112 .",
    "otherwise , the local dynamics exhibits the period - doubling route to chaos , which is expected since the population growth is governed by ricker s model @xcite .",
    "we find that the organization of patches in a lattice geometry and the dispersal of a fraction @xmath0 of engineers to neighboring patches have no influence on the metapopulation dynamics when the attractors of the local dynamics are periodic .",
    "in fact , our simulations indicate that the finite - engineers fixed point and the @xmath169-point cycles are always stable with respect to inhomogeneous perturbations , which precludes the existence of turing instabilities @xcite and lessens the prospects of deriving useful analytical results for the spatial model @xcite . in the case",
    "the local dynamics is chaotic , however , the diffusive dispersal has some surprising effects .",
    "in particular , for certain values of the dispersal fraction the chaotic behavior is suppressed and the dynamics enters a two - point cycle .",
    "perhaps more telling is the finding that diffusive dispersal can prevent the dynamics from being drawn to the zero - engineers attractor for large @xmath1 , and so can prevent the extinction of the metapopulation in a case where a single population in the absence of dispersal would die off .",
    "this finding is in agreement with the notion that extinctions resulting from large fluctuations of the chaotic dynamics can be eluded if the population is composed of patches weakly coupled by migration @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty to explore the spatial patterns exhibited by the multi - patch engineer ecosystem is that the patchy , biological - like patterns appear only in the regime of spatio - temporal chaos . despite using quadruple precision to iterate the recursion equations in that regime",
    ", we managed to follow the metapopulation for a few hundred generations at most , before our reliability marker  the symmetries of the square lattice  indicated that the numerical errors were unacceptable .",
    "since the local dynamics of the continuous - time model does not exhibit chaotic behavior @xcite , it would be interesting to check whether a model continuous both in time and space would produce meaningful spatial patterns and whether the diffusive dispersal would play any role in the metapopulation dynamics , as the nontrivial results reported here for the coupled map lattice own solely to the chaotic behavior of the local dynamics .",
