    "the existence of haldane gap @xcite in the magnetic excitation spectrum has kept the integer - spin one - dimensional ( 1d ) heisenberg antiferromagnet to be one of the most interesting subjects in condensed matter physics during the past twenty years . the integer - spin heisenberg antiferromagnetic ( af ) chain should have a singlet ground state , exponentially decaying correlations , and a quantum gap , which have been confirmed by numerous theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies .",
    "kennedy and tasaki have proved that the appearance of haldane gap in the spin-1 af chain corresponds to the breaking of a hidden @xmath2 symmetry @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery of coexistence of haldane gap and af long - range order ( af lro ) in rare - earth compounds @xmath0 with @xmath3=@xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite has offered an opportunity to investigate the effect of staggered field on the haldane chain . the polarized and unpolarized inelastic neutron scattering experiments on @xmath0 @xcite present that , on the one hand , there are af interactions between spins of rare - earth and @xmath1 ions , which lead to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) af lro with nel temperature ( @xmath6 ) ranging from @xmath7 @xcite . on the other hand , these compounds",
    "are also characterized by the presence of @xmath8 octahedron chains along @xmath9-axis .",
    "as is anticipated , above the nel temperature , energy gap has been found in the excitation propagating along @xmath1-chain .",
    "also the haldane gap is discovered to persist in the 3d af phase and increase with decreasing temperature below @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "recently several theoretical works have focused on the quasi-1d haldane system @xmath0 @xcite . to describe the coexistence of haldane gap and af lro , the nonlinear sigma model in a static staggered magnetic field has been introduced by maslov and zheludev @xcite .",
    "this system has been studied numerically within the density matrix renormalization group method by adopting the model of an 1d spin-@xmath11 heisenberg chain in a static field @xcite . in the above studies , the reason for introducing the static staggered field",
    "is based on the assumption that there are 3d directly af exchange interactions between the spins of rare - earth ions , which lead to the af lro below @xmath6 .",
    "however , it has been pointed out by some experiments @xcite that spins of @xmath1 ions also play an important role in forming af lro , and the two - dimensional mixed - spin heisenberg model with @xmath12 and @xmath13 chains staked alternatively has also been adopted for this system @xcite .",
    "depending on the experimental finding of crystal structure , we introduce a more suitable 3d mixed - spin af heisenberg model to describe the magnetic properties of compounds @xmath14 . in this model",
    "we define @xmath15 for the spins of @xmath1 ions , and investigate different members of this family by changing the spin value @xmath16 of rare - earth ions correspondingly .",
    "we use the schwinger - boson mean - field ( sbmf ) @xcite theory to study this 3d mixed - spin model .",
    "the sbmf theory has been successful to the study of spin - integer heisenberg chains @xcite , and has also been extended to cases with magnetic ordering by identifying the magnetization with the bose condensation of the schwinger bosons @xcite . within this model",
    ", we could explain the experimental discovery of coexistence of haldane gap and af lro .",
    "the interactions between spins of @xmath1 and rare - earth ions are proved to be very important in forming the af lro .",
    "properties such as the magnetization , haldane gap and nel temperatures are also discussed for cases with different @xmath16 .",
    "comparing our results with neutron scattering experiments , we find that our findings could explain some experimental discoveries .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the 3d mixed - spin heisenberg model and schwinger - boson mean - field theory .",
    "our results of the magnetic properties of @xmath0 compounds are presented in sec .",
    "finally , we conclude our findings in sec .",
    "the crystal structures of @xmath0 compounds have been investigated extensively by neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "they belong to the orthorhombic system , having approximate cell parameters around @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in all members of this compounds , as figure 1(b ) shown , strings of distorted @xmath20 octahedron share apical oxygen and form haldane chains along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "the intrachain @xmath1-@xmath21-@xmath1 af superexchange coupling is about @xmath22-@xmath23 @xcite , which is the strongest magnetic interaction in the compound . while in the @xmath24 plane , as figure 1(a ) shown , there is one oxygen between the @xmath1 and rare - earth ( @xmath3)ions , and thus the @xmath1-@xmath21-@xmath3 interactions establish links between individual @xmath1 chains .",
    "this coupling is of the order of tens of kelvin ( @xmath25-@xmath26 ) .",
    "figure 1(a ) also shows that there are @xmath3-@xmath21-@xmath3 af interactions between rare - earth ions , which is of the order of @xmath27 or less .",
    "based on the experimental discovery of the crystal structure of compounds @xmath0 , we introduce a 3d mixed - spin af heisenberg model expressed by the hamiltonian @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the spin operators of @xmath1 and rare - earth ions respectively . @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote a sum over nearest - neighbor ( nn ) bonds in the @xmath24 plane , and so is @xmath33 for the nn bonds along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "the af superexchange couplings along the @xmath1 chain , between @xmath3 and @xmath34 ions , and among the rare - earth @xmath3 ions are represented as @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 respectively as figure 1(a ) shown .",
    "the schwinger - boson theory introduces @xmath38",
    "( @xmath39 ( or @xmath40)@xmath41)@xcite , and the spin degrees of freedom are mapped to the boson degrees of freedom .",
    "meanwhile the original spin hilbert space corresponds to a boson hilbert subspace in which @xmath42 .",
    "these constraints to the boson hilbert space are imposed in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) by introducing two kinds of lagrangian multipliers @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , we define the bond operators as @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . the hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be rewritten as    @xmath48    next , we make a hartree - fock decomposition of eq .",
    "( 2 ) by taking the average values of the bond operators and lagrange multipliers to be uniform and static as @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . under the fourier transformation , we obtain the following mean - field hamiltonian in the momentum space    @xmath54    where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .    diagonalizing @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) by the bogoliubov transformation , we obtain    @xmath59    with    @xmath60    furthermore , the mean - field free energy is given by    @xmath61    the mean - field equations are obtained by differentiating @xmath62 with respect to the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 as    @xmath68    thus we obtain five self - consistent equations to determine the average values of the bond operators and lagrange multipliers .",
    "in this section , we present the solutions of the sbmf theory .",
    "the experimental discovery of coexistence of haldane gap and af lro below @xmath6 are obtained by our study . as equation ( 5 )",
    "shown , there are two branches of the magnetic excitations @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which have quite different behaviors below @xmath6 . on the one hand",
    ", the magnetic excitation @xmath69 has an energy gap in the whole temperature region , and below @xmath6 this energy gap increases with decreasing temperature . on the other hand , within the temperature region from zero to @xmath6",
    ", @xmath70 keeps to be gapless and has its minimal value @xmath71 at @xmath72 . under this condition ,",
    "the schwinger - boson condensation occurs and leads to the af lro in this system . in our calculation",
    ", we introduce the schwinger - boson condensation into the self - consistent mean - field equations , and obtain the temperature dependence of the magnetizations of @xmath1 ( @xmath73 ) and rare - earth ( @xmath74 ) ions below @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the magnetizations @xmath73 and @xmath74 are expressed as @xmath75 we choose the af superexchange interactions as @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) according to the experimental studies of the magnetic properties of compounds @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the af interactions between @xmath1 ions has been estimated as @xmath80 by the neutron scattering experiments @xcite . to make it simple and clear , in our calculation we choose @xmath81 .",
    "the neutron scattering experimental results of @xmath82 obtained by yokoo _",
    "@xcite are shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) ( open circles ) .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) show fits to the above experimental results by our numerical calculations for the case with @xmath83 respectively .",
    "the temperature dependence of magnetizations @xmath84 and @xmath85 for the cases of @xmath86 , and @xmath87 are shown in figure 2(c ) and 2(d ) respectively .",
    "as temperature increases , the thermal fluctuation in the system becomes stronger , and the magnetizations decrease rapidly and drop to zero at the nel temperatures .",
    "therefore , we could also determine the nel temperatures @xmath6 for all members of the @xmath14 family through our calculation .    in figure 3",
    ", we plot the nel temperature @xmath6 as a function of spin value @xmath16 ( filled circles and dotted line ) . for comparison ,",
    "the nel temperatures of compounds @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) @xcite , @xmath82 ( @xmath90 ) @xcite and @xmath91 ( @xmath92)@xcite obtained by the neutron scattering experiments are also shown in fig .",
    "3 ( filled triangles ) .",
    "our theoretical results roughly agree with the experimental results .",
    "we also obtain that the nel temperature @xmath6 increases monotonously with the increasing of @xmath16 . as the spin value of the rare - earth ions @xmath16 equal to @xmath93 and @xmath87",
    ", we get that the minimize and maximum nel temperature are @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively .",
    "our result of the nel temperature region is approximately from @xmath96 to @xmath97 when @xmath81 , which is in good agreement with the experimental estimation of @xmath6 region @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "the two branches of the magnetic excitation @xmath99 and @xmath100 represent the spin fluctuations along the @xmath9-axis and within @xmath24 plane respectively . in the exactly one - dimensional case ( @xmath101 ) ,",
    "the excitation @xmath100 vanishes and the energy gap of @xmath99 is just the haldane gap of af heisenberg chain , which is closely related to the breaking of a hidden @xmath2 symmetry @xcite .",
    "we obtain that the coexistence of haldane gap and af lro below @xmath6 is a common feather of all members of compounds @xmath14 except @xmath102 .",
    "the neutron scattering experiments have discovered that , below the nel temperature , the haldane gap increases as the temperature decreases @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependences of the haldane gap @xmath103 for the cases of @xmath86 and @xmath87 are also investigated by the sbmf theory and the behaviors are shown in figure 4(a ) respectively .",
    "the temperature dependence of the energy gap @xmath103 obtained by our calculation is found to agrees with the experimental discovery .",
    "our calculation also implies that the effect of the staggered magnetization on the magnetic excitation is to widen the haldane gap .",
    "below @xmath6 , the effective internal magnetic field @xmath104 imposed on the haldane chain is assumed approximately as the magnetization @xmath73 of @xmath1 ions .",
    "this field is found to increase with the decreasing of temperature and the increasing of spin value @xmath16 because of the thermal fluctuation being weakened and the af ordering being enhanced . in figure 4(b ) , we plot the energy gap @xmath103 of zero temperature as a function of @xmath104 , and we find that @xmath104 has strong effect to widen the haldane gap .",
    "in addition , based on the 3d mixed - spin model , we obtain that af lro below the nel temperature is not constructed only by the rare - earth ions .",
    "our results support the suggestion that @xmath1 ions also play an important role in forming the af lro .",
    "we plot in figure 5 the nel temperature as a function of af coupling @xmath36 in the cases with @xmath13 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 . in compounds",
    "@xmath14 , the effective interactions between individual @xmath1 chains rely on the af coupling @xmath36 between @xmath107 and rare - earth @xmath108 .",
    "we obtain that the nel temperature rises rapidly with the increase of @xmath36 as shown in figure 5 , so the coupling @xmath36 are important in forming the af lro .",
    "besides , as @xmath109 , there are no interactions between @xmath1 chains and thus the nel temperature drops to zero .",
    "the haldane excitation energy @xmath110 in 3d and 1d cases are shown in figure 6(a ) and 6(b ) respectively . here",
    "we choose @xmath13 , @xmath105 , @xmath111 , @xmath106 , and @xmath112 for the 3d case , and obtain that the corresponding nel temperature is @xmath113 . to compare the behaviors of magnetic excitations below and above the nel temperature , we study two conditions of @xmath114 ( solid lines ) and @xmath115 ( dotted lines ) respectively for both 1d and 3d cases . in the 3d case , we find , in figure 6(a ) , that the energy gap below the nel temperature is obviously bigger than that above the nel temperature , which is in opposition with the behavior for pure 1d case ( shown in figure 6(b ) ) .",
    "in addition , we obtain that the thermal fluctuation has strong effect to destroy the 3d spin correlations in the compounds , as a result the behaviors in 3d case is the same as that in 1d case when temperature is above the nel temperature .",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced a 3d mixed - spin af heisenberg model based on the experimental results of the crystal magnetic structure of compounds @xmath0 , and studied this model with the sbmf theory .",
    "the experimental discovery of coexistence of haldane gap and af lro below @xmath6 has been deduced by our calculation .",
    "properties such as the low - lying excitations , magnetizations of @xmath1 and rare - earth ions , nel temperatures of different members of this family and behavior of haldane gap below @xmath6 have also been investigated within this model .",
    "we have obtained two branches of the magnetic excitations @xmath69 and @xmath70 , of which @xmath69 has an energy gap and @xmath70 is gapless below @xmath6 .",
    "the theoretical result of the nel temperature region is approximately from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , which is in good agreement with the experimental estimation of the region @xmath98 .",
    "we have also obtained that haldane gap increases with decreasing temperature , and the effect of the magnetization is to widen the haldane gap .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the experimental discoveries .",
