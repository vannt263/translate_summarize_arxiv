    "the measurement of the two double polarization observables @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite in photoproduction of neutral pions revealed significant differences between the data and the predictions from analyses such as maid  @xcite , said  @xcite , and bnga  @xcite .",
    "partly , large discrepancies were observed even at rather low photon energies . this was surprising since the reaction @xmath3 is certainly the best studied photoproduction process .",
    "these discrepancies underline the importance of polarization observables for an interpretation of photoproduction data .    in this letter",
    ", we report a measurement of further polarization observables , called @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , for the reaction @xmath6 all three observables were determined simultaneously from the same measurement and provide the next important step toward a better understanding of @xmath7 photoproduction .",
    "the target asymmetry @xmath0 is a measure of the azimuthal asymmetry when the target nucleon carries polarization @xmath8 in a direction perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "@xmath1 , often termed the recoil polarization observable , is a measure of the induced polarization of the recoiling nucleon . here",
    ", @xmath1 is determined from a double polarization measurement rather than from an experimentally more challenging direct measurement of the recoil polarization .",
    "this has the advantage that @xmath1 can be determined in the very same measurement for almost the full solid angle , rather than by measuring @xmath1 for specific points in angle and energy , as it has been done in the past .",
    "the observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be determined from azimuthal asymmetries using measurements with linearly polarized photons and transversely polarized target nucleons having polarization @xmath8 .",
    "part of the data presented here were used as a basis for an energy independent partial wave analysis ( pwa )  @xcite .",
    "they are now included in the bnga pwa and multipoles for reaction  ( [ reac ] ) were determined .",
    "the multipoles were compared to those from maid , said , juelich2015  @xcite and earlier bnga pwa - solutions .",
    "the experiment was performed at the bonn electron stretcher accelerator elsa @xcite .",
    "linearly polarized photons were produced by scattering a 3.2gev electron beam off a diamond crystal @xcite .",
    "the crystal was oriented to position the coherent edge at 950mev , leading to a polarization maximum of @xmath9% at 850mev which declined to 40% at 700mev .",
    "two perpendicular settings of the beam polarization plane were used ( named @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "photon energies were measured in a tagging system described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the photon beam hits a butanol ( @xmath12 ) target with transversely polarized protons @xcite with a mean proton polarization of @xmath13% .",
    "data were taken with two opposite settings of the target polarization direction ( named @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "the incoming photons may produce a @xmath7 in the reaction  ( [ reac ] ) .",
    "the neutral pions were reconstructed from their @xmath16 decays in the crystal barrel ( 1320 csi(tl)-crystals )  @xcite and taps ( 216 baf@xmath17 crystals )  @xcite electromagnetic calorimeters ( see fig .  [",
    "pic : detector ] ) which cover almost the full angular range down to @xmath18 in the forward direction . protons from reaction  ( [ reac ] )",
    "were detected in a three - layer cylindrical scintillation detector with 513 fibers @xcite surrounding the target , in 180 small organic scintillators in front of 90 forward csi(tl ) crystals covering the angular range from 27.5@xmath19 to 11.2@xmath19 , and in organic scintillators mounted in front of each of the baf@xmath17 crystals .",
    "a co@xmath17 cherenkov detector was installed in front of the baf@xmath17 crystals to identify background from electromagnetic reactions .",
    "the first - level trigger was derived from the tagger , the fiber detector , the forward calorimeters , and from the co@xmath17 cherenkov detector as a veto ; a second - level trigger used a fast cluster encoder ( face ) @xcite and selected events with at least two distinct calorimeter hits in the full detector assembly . for further analysis only events with three distinct calorimeter hits were used . adding events",
    "where only the two photons were measured would lead to an increased background contribution from other channels since several of the cuts discussed below can no longer be applied . for the events with three calorimeter hits ,",
    "all three possible combinations were treated as @xmath20 candidates , with the proton being treated as a missing particle .",
    "kinematic cuts were applied to ensure momentum conservation .",
    "examples for the missing mass and azimuthal angle difference distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ pic : dilution ] .",
    "energy- and angle - dependent @xmath21 cuts were applied based on the corresponding distributions .",
    "in addition , a @xmath21-cut on the polar - angle difference between the directions of the missing proton and the measured proton candidate was performed , and @xmath22 events were selected by a @xmath21 cut on the invariant @xmath23 mass .",
    "finally , a time coincidence was required between the tagger hit and the reaction products and a random - time background subtraction was performed .",
    "this resulted in a final data sample containing a total of @xmath24 million @xmath25 events .",
    "the background contamination was estimated from the invariant @xmath23 mass spectrum ( see fig .  [",
    "pic : mgg ] ) , assuming a linear behaviour of the background under the peak .",
    "it is less than 1% for all energies and angles .",

    "the fits is flat with a distinct increase well below 0.1% , as can be seen in fig .",
    "this increase was traced to fits of distributions with very low statistics ( due to a low cross section or low acceptance ) .",
    "these fits were very sensitive to background fluctuations .",
    "these data were excluded from further analysis by performing a cl - cut at 0.1% .     +            the data on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 as functions of center - of - mass energy @xmath27 and angle @xmath29 are shown in figs .",
    "[ pic : t][pic : h ] .",
    "all observables exhibit a strong angular dependence which also changes significantly with @xmath27 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty shown includes the uncertainty in the degree of photon ( 4% ) and proton ( 2% ) polarizations , in the dilution factor ( 1%4% ) , and an additional absolute uncertainty ( 0.01 ) due to the remaining background contribution .",
    "for further details on the estimation of the systematic uncertainties see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the polarization observable @xmath1 describes the polarization of the outgoing proton in the direction perpendicular to the scattering plane . here ,",
    "it was determined indirectly from the correlation of beam and target polarization .",
    "thus , both observables , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , were measured only in the energy region in which the photon beam carried a significant linear polarization ; the results are hence restricted to the 665 to 930mev photon energy range . the target asymmetry @xmath0 , shown in fig .",
    "[ pic : t ] , does not require polarized photons , and the data allowed us to determine @xmath0 up to @xmath30mev .",
    "above this energy , the count rates were small , and we do not present those results here .",
    "the new data agree well with previously reported measurements of @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath0 @xcite but exceed the old data in precision and coverage in angles and energy .",
    "for @xmath2 no earlier data exist in this energy range , the older data @xcite are limited to @xmath31 1300mev .",
    "our data up to 930mev were used as a basis for an energy independent pwa  @xcite .",
    "the high energy @xmath0-data are presented here for the first time .",
    "the new data sets have been included in the bnga - pwa as discussed in the following .",
    "the data were fitted within the bnga multi - channel partial wave analysis . compared to our solutions bnga2011 - 01 and bnga2011 - 02 , further data were included  @xcite .",
    "relevant for the @xmath3 multipoles are the new data on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 as well as our recently published data on @xmath4 @xcite and on @xmath5 @xcite . figures  [ pina ] and [ pinb ] compare the newly determined multipoles with those of bnga2011 - 01 and bnga2011 - 02 .",
    "the error bands for the bnga2011 solutions were derived from the ( @xmath32 ) spread of 12 different solutions with different assumptions on the ingredients : the number of poles in the @xmath33 wave was 3 or 4 , in the @xmath34 wave 2 or 3 , the @xmath35 width of the pole converged to a wide ( @xmath36600mev ) or a narrow ( @xmath36250mev ) value , a k - matrix formalism was used or , alternatively , an @xmath37-parametrization  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath38 ranged from its minimum @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "( note that the absolute @xmath38 value is meaningless since part of the data are multiparticle final states and fitted in an event - based likelihood fit .",
    "the log likelihood value is then converted into a pseudo-@xmath38  @xcite . )    in the new fits , we started from the same solutions and re - optimized all parameters .",
    "all fits converged , but 6 fits resulted in a @xmath38 larger than the new @xmath38-minimum ( @xmath41 ) by 1000 units or more .",
    "these fits , mostly those with only 3 poles in the @xmath33 wave , were then removed from the error analysis .",
    "the resulting error bands for all remaining solutions within @xmath42 are also shown in figs .",
    "[ pina ] and  [ pinb ] .",
    "the @xmath38-range for the new solutions was chosen consistently with the bnga2011 solutions for which the multipoles have first been shown in  @xcite .",
    "the new error bands are significantly smaller than the previous ones .",
    "averaged over all multipoles and energies , the errors are reduced by a factor of 2.25 .",
    "examples for multipoles which are substantially better defined are the @xmath43 multipole to which the roper resonance and @xmath44 contribute and the @xmath45 multipole to which the @xmath46-resonances contribute . in most cases ,",
    "the old error bars cover the range of new solutions , the solutions are at least compatible with each other at the @xmath47 level over the full mass range .",
    "there are few changes to the multipoles only : the @xmath48 multipole leading to the excitation of @xmath49 and @xmath50 resonances with @xmath33 has kept its structure but its imaginary part has increased in strength in the fourth resonance region .",
    "similar changes are also visible in the real part . the real part of the @xmath45 multipole ( @xmath46 ) has become smaller in absolute value in the @xmath51 region , while in the imaginary part changes are observed in the high mass region around @xmath52 . in all cases , where discrepancies with the maid and said solutions were observed , these discrepancies remain while the consistency between bnga2011 and bnga2014 is rather good .",
    "the multipoles from juelich2015  @xcite show also significant differences compared to bnga2014 .",
    "summarizing , we have reported a simultaneous measurement of the polarization observables @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 . with the data presented here",
    "an additional step toward a complete experiment in @xmath7-photoproduction off the proton has been made .",
    "the data provide a more precise determination of the photoproduction multipoles governing the photoproduction of single neutral pions off protons .",
