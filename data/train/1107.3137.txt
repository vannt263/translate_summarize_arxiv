    "in recent years our understanding of the broad global characteristics of galaxies in the young universe has grown considerably . using rest - frame uv and optical spectroscopy and multi - wavelength broadband photometry it has been possible to estimate their stellar and dynamical masses , average metallicities , ages , and star formation rates across cosmic time from @xmath11 to the present day ( e.g. , shapley et al . 2005 ; cowie & barger 2008 ; maiolino et al .",

    "we close by discussing a few of the caveats and complications that can affect the mass - radius relation that we have derived .    first",
    ", the galaxies in the @xmath55 subsample have fainter @xmath79 magnitudes than galaxies in the lower redshift bins ( figure [ pophist.fig ] ) , and figure [ robfig.fig ] demonstrated ( see discussion in  [ magrobust.sec ] ) that the recovered value of @xmath119 can vary as a function of total source magnitude .",

    "first , @xmath119 is extremely stable for galaxies with isolated morphologies and small radii characteristic of much of the observational sample .",
    "while @xmath119 is less robust to @xmath79 magnitude for larger and more irregular galaxies , the majority of the variation occurs for magnitudes @xmath351 which we deliberately exclude from our analysis .",
    "the mean observed magnitudes of our @xmath352 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 samples are @xmath353 respectively . across such a small range",
    "@xmath354 mag the change in radius for all morphological types is @xmath355% , comparable to the statistical uncertainty in the quoted @xmath281 .",
    "indeed , even were we to include faint galaxies with @xmath351 in our analysis we find that the mean values of @xmath281 change by @xmath356 .",
    "it is also possible that our results may be biased due to our assumption that the radius @xmath119 of a multi - component system may be characterized by the radius of the brightest individual component , while our stellar masses ( derived from seeing - limited ground - based photometry and similarly confused _ spitzer_/irac photometry ) represent the integral over the light of all of the components .",
    "if we repeat our previous analyses instead assuming that the stellar mass of these systems is proportional to the fraction of the @xmath79 flux in the primary component , or simply omitting galaxies with multiple well - defined individual components from our analysis , we find that values for @xmath281 in each of the three redshift bins are consistent with their previously calculated values to within @xmath357 .",
    "we are therefore confident that our results are not significantly affected by our assumption of how to define @xmath119 for multi - component systems",
    ".    some of the apparent evolution in characteristic radius at fixed stellar mass from @xmath6 to @xmath358 may also be due to the variable @xmath258-correction in our fixed observational bandpass . with an effective wavelength of @xmath26 , the f160w filter probes rest frame 5548 , 4758 , and 4044   emission at the mean redshift of three samples ( @xmath359 ) .",
    "however , we note that the effective radii derived for our galaxies in the q1700 + 64 field varied by only @xmath360% from rest - frame 5000  to rest - frame 2500 ; linear interpolation suggests that the change from 5000  to 4000  would be much smaller , @xmath361% .",

    "another method of identifying mergers is to count the number of systems with close physical pairs . in practice , we consider systems with multiple distinct clumps of comparable @xmath79 flux ( @xmath50 3:1 - 1:1 ) in their light profiles , colors consistent with the rest - uv selection criteria , and well - defined separations in the range 5 @xmath379 16 kpc ( i.e. , are classified as type ii galaxies ) as physical pair candidates",
    ". will be in our spectroscopic sample , but we do not expect this to bias the derived pair _ fraction _ because the spectroscopic targets were chosen independently of whether or not they appeared to be in angular pairs . ] for galaxies with @xmath185 and @xmath255 we find that the fraction of pairs is @xmath380 , @xmath381 , and @xmath382 at @xmath375 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 respectively",
    ". some fraction of these candidates will not be physical pairs however , but simply projected angular pairs of galaxies with different redshifts and no physical association .",
    "one effort to constrain the incidence rate of false pairs can be made by extrapolating the false pair fraction observed at larger distances for which spectroscopic redshifts can be obtained for individual objects . considering the 2874 galaxies ( across 19 different fields ) in our catalog with spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath383 , we count the number of distinct angular pairs as a function of separation in comparison to the number of genuine physical pairs whose spectroscopic redshifts lie within @xmath384 of each other . as illustrated by figure [ pairs_larger.fig ] , extrapolation of this relation to the radii probed by our wfc3 data",
    "suggests that @xmath385% of our observed pairs should correspond to genuine physical pairs .",
    "alternatively , we can also estimate the false pair fraction based on the statistical distribution of objects in the wfc3 imaging fields . using our source extractor catalogs",
    ", we evaluate the number of unique pairs with primary magnitudes in the range @xmath386 and secondary magnitudes within 1 magnitude of the primary as a function of their separation radius . assuming that the majority of such pairs in the wfc3 fields are false pairs",
    ", we estimate that @xmath387% of galaxies have false pairs within @xmath388 kpc .",
    "subtracting this 0.07 false pair fraction from the angular pair fraction calculated above , we obtain the true physical pair fractions @xmath389 , @xmath390 , and @xmath391 at @xmath375 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 respectively for separations in the range 5 kpc @xmath392 16 kpc .",
    "we note that these values are consistent to with observational uncertainty with what would be derived had we simply assumed that 50% of angular pairs were false pairs .",
    "as detailed above , estimates of the merger fraction @xmath393 derived from all three methods are roughly constant across our three redshift ranges , albeit with mild evidence ( at the @xmath394 level ) for a decline in the merger fraction at @xmath395 ( see figure [ mergerrate.fig ] , left - hand panel ) . in order to construct the merger",
    "_ rate _ from the merger _ fraction _",
    "it is necessary to combine the merger fractions with the estimated timescale @xmath396 for visibility and the comoving space density @xmath397 of the target sample ( see , e.g. , lotz et al .",
    "2008a):@xmath398    estimating the comoving space densities by integrating the mass functions for the star forming galaxy sample given by reddy & steidel ( 2009 ) above @xmath399 , and adopting @xmath400 gyr , @xmath401 gyr , and @xmath402 gyr ( see discussion in ",
    "[ mergerprop.sec ] ) , we obtain estimates of the merger rate as shown in figure [ mergerrate.fig ] ( right - hand panel )",
    ". clearly the actual merger rate of our galaxies is highly uncertain , and for the small number of galaxies observed in the present sample it is not possible to comment meaningfully on the evolution of the merger fraction with redshift ( although our results are consistent with those derived for similar populations of galaxies in other studies ; see , e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2011a and references therein ) . even for significantly larger galaxy samples",
    "( e.g. , faber et al . 2011 ) it may prove difficult to constrain the merger rate given the large uncertainty in observability timescales that require numerical simulations to constrain .",
    "it is not obvious whether it is meaningful from a physical sense to identify galaxies as mergers on the basis of their rest - frame optical morphology . as argued by some authors ( e.g. , bournaud et al .",
    "2008 ; genzel et al .",
    "2011 ) irregular morphologies may instead arise from dynamical instabilities within gas - rich systems . additionally , as we demonstrated in law et al .",
    "( 2007b ) and expand upon below , merger - like morphologies are poorly correlated with other physical observables .",
    "there are significant differences between the subsamples of @xmath255 galaxies from our survey selected as mergers at @xmath54 according to different criteria .",
    "@xmath403% of such galaxies are identified as mergers on the basis of their morphological asymmetry , while @xmath404% are identified using the @xmath367 selection criterion , and @xmath405% using pair statistics .",
    "as illustrated in figures [ caplot.fig ] and [ gm20.fig ] , 76% of galaxies selected as mergers according to @xmath367 are also selected as mergers using @xmath373 , but only 39% of galaxies selected as mergers using @xmath373 are also selected as mergers according to @xmath367 . similarly ,",
    "59% ( 45% ) of mergers identified by @xmath367 ( asymmetry ) are also identified as mergers based on the presence of a nearby angular pair . clearly ,",
    "while there is a significant overlap between the galaxy samples , there are also a significant number of galaxies uniquely selected by each technique .",
    "this difference is unsurprising given that the various morphological selection criteria may isolate mergers with different mass ratios and in a different range of evolutionary phases .",
    "lotz et al .",
    "( 2008b , 2010ab ) performed a series of hydrodynamic simulations to explore the timescales and visibility of disk galaxy mergers as a function of morphological selection criterion , mass ratio , and gas content .",
    "dividing their mergers into six stages ( pre - merger , first - pass , maximal separation , final merger , post merger , remnant ) these authors found that the observability of mergers at rest - frame 4686   can vary dramatically from stage to stage .",
    "for the ` g3gf1 ' model , . ]",
    "lotz et al .",
    "( 2010b ) find that @xmath367 and pair criteria tend to have observability timescales @xmath406 gyr and @xmath402 gyr ( predominantly identifying first - passage mergers ) while the @xmath373 criterion has a longer observability timescale @xmath407 ( identifying both first - passage and final mergers ; see also conselice et al .",
    ". the greater fraction of galaxies that we identify as mergers based on their asymmetry than by the other two methods ( figure [ mergerrate.fig ] ) may therefore simply reflect this large difference in observability timescales .",
    "further , lotz et al . ( 2010a ) find that while @xmath99 is most sensitive to major mergers like those identified using our pair selection criteria ( @xmath408 flux ratio ) , @xmath367 detects both major and minor mergers , potentially explaining why we identify more mergers using @xmath367 than with pair selection .    in figure [ mphhist1.fig ] we plot histograms of various physical properties for galaxies classified as mergers / non - mergers according to the @xmath367 , @xmath99 , and pair criteria and use a ks test to evaluate the significance of the null hypothesis that both sets of galaxies ( mergers and non - mergers ) were drawn from the same distribution .",
    "we conclude that for almost all physical parameters ( stellar mass , sfr , rest - frame @xmath409 color , etc . )",
    "there is no significant difference ( confidence in the null hypothesis @xmath410% ) between putative mergers and non - mergers .",
    "similarly , there is no obvious difference in the gas - phase kinematics between mergers and non - mergers , although our sample size of 35 galaxies with systemic h@xmath48 redshifts and high - quality uv spectra is too small to conclusively rule out association .",
    "the one notable exception is that galaxies identified as mergers via the @xmath367 or pair classification schemes have significantly smaller radii and correspondingly higher @xmath10 than non - mergers .",
    "this may suggest either that @xmath10 peaks around the first - passage during a major merger event , or that the @xmath367 and pair classification schemes are simply effective at finding galaxies with small radii . the lack of correlation observed between morphology and these physical observables may be unsurprising in light of both numerical uncertainties in our morphologies ( i.e. , exactly where the dividing line between mergers and non - mergers lies ) and expectations ( e.g. , lotz et al .",
    "2010ab ) that star formation may typically peak after the major morphological disturbances have subsided .",
    "regardless , it is unclear whether it is physically meaningful to classify @xmath101 galaxies as mergers on the basis of morphology alone given that there appears to be little to distinguish these systems ( whether observed in the rest - optical or the rest - uv ; see discussion by law et al .",
    "2007b , see also swinbank et al .",
    "2010 for a similar discussion of submillimeter galaxies ) from their non - merging counterparts .",
    "rather , it may simply be that _ most _ @xmath101 star forming galaxies are dynamically unstable systems driven by the accretion of large quantities of gas , whether this gas is acquired through mergers , cold - mode , or hot - mode accretion processes .",
    "we have presented rest - optical morphologies for a sample of 306 spectroscopically confirmed @xmath20 star forming galaxies with stellar masses in the range @xmath4 . since these galaxies were distributed among 10 different fields widely separated on the sky the effects of sample variance are expected to be greatly reduced compared to surveys over contiguous regions of similar total area .",
    "we summarize our principle scientific conclusions as follows :    1 .",
    "typical @xmath411 star forming galaxies have circularized effective radii @xmath412 kpc and a projected @xmath161 exponential surface brightness profile that extends out to @xmath413 in stacked galaxy images .",
    "the observed sizes are consistent with previous observational estimates ( e.g. , buitrago et al .",
    "2008 ; kriek et al .",
    "2009 ) for high - mass galaxy populations and with numerical simulations ( e.g. , sales et al . 2010 ) that assume strong stellar feedback .",
    "2 .   a stellar mass - radius relation for star forming galaxies",
    "is observed to exist as early as @xmath6 ; at fixed mass typical sizes evolve with redshift as @xmath414 in the interval @xmath415 to @xmath416 .",
    "these galaxies must grow at least as fast as @xmath417 in order to evolve onto the local late - type galaxy relation by the present day .",
    "the distribution of axis ratios @xmath111 is strongly inconsistent with a population of axisymmetric thick exponential disks and more consistent with a population of triaxial ellipsoids with intrinsic minor / major and intermediate / major axis ratios @xmath418 and @xmath419 respectively .",
    "the typical ellipticity is qualitatively similar to that previously found by ravindranath et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , but there may be mild evidence for evolution with wavelength .",
    "the ellipsoidal nature of these galaxies indicates at minimum that the distribution of stellar mass within them is markedly asymmetric , and ( in combination with their high gas fractions and velocity dispersions ) may further suggest that they are not in stable dynamical equilibrium with short - lived gas disks ( e.g. , ceverino et al . 2010 ) continually forming and re - forming from recently accreted gas until stabilized ( e.g. , martig et al . 2010 ) by a sufficiently massive triaxial stellar component .",
    "consistent with previous studies ( e.g. , dickinson 2000 ; papovich et al .",
    "2005 ) , rest - optical ( @xmath420 ) and rest - uv ( @xmath421  ) morphology for @xmath15 star forming galaxies is generally similar with typical color dispersion @xmath422 ( although rest - uv radii are larger by @xmath263% on average ) , while high mass ( @xmath9 ) galaxies tend to exhibit greater morphological differences with @xmath244 as large as @xmath423 ( although c.f .",
    "bond et al .",
    "the most massive galaxies in our sample are typically bright and well nucleated at rest - optical wavelengths but faint and diffuse in the rest - uv . 5 .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that while the nonparametric morphological statistics @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 calculated using different segmentation maps commonly adopted in the literature are strongly correlated with each other , there can be systematic offsets that are important to account for when comparing values between samples or estimating merger fractions .",
    "merger fractions estimated according to the @xmath367 , @xmath99 , or pair criteria are consistent with recent determinations in the literature ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2011a ) , with evidence for at most mild evolution with redshift .",
    "there is moderate overlap between galaxies selected as mergers with these three criteria , but in general mergers and non - mergers have statistically indistinguishable distributions of measured and inferred properties ( sfr , stellar mass , etc . ) , with the exception that mergers selected by the pair and @xmath367 statistics have smaller effective radii and correspondingly larger @xmath10 .",
    "we suggest that most @xmath101 star forming galaxies may be dynamically unstable systems driven by the accretion of large quantities of gas , whether this gas is acquired through mergers , cold - mode , or hot - mode accretion processes .",
    "in general , our observations are consistent with inside - out growth of star forming galaxies in the young universe .",
    "we suggest that mass growth proceeds according to the following qualitative picture : ` typical ' @xmath15 star forming galaxies appear to be gas - rich , compact , triaxial systems systems that are dominated by velocity dispersion between individual star forming regions rather than systemic rotation , and whose high @xmath10 drives strong outflows into the surrounding igm .",
    "as these galaxies mature they gain stellar mass , stabilizing the formation of extended ( albeit still thick ) gaseous disks in which rotational support plays an increasing role .",
    "as the star formation migrates from central regions into these extended disks the @xmath10 drops , and the disk component superimposes a zero - velocity component atop the outflowing absorption line gas ( law et al .",

    "( 2007 ) used a scaled surface brightness method to select galaxy pixels whose flux is at least @xmath424 , where @xmath425 is the standard deviation of the sky pixels , and @xmath108 scales with source redshift as @xmath426 , where @xmath427 . , we adopt @xmath428 for consistency with law et al . 2007b .",
    "this corresponds to a selection threshold of @xmath429 at @xmath56 , and @xmath430 at @xmath318 . ]",
    "this method is independent of galaxy morphology and compensates for cosmological surface brightness dimming ( which scales as @xmath431 for a fixed observational bandpass ) , therefore giving consistent results across a given redshift interval .",
    "however , it is explicitly tied to the noise characteristics of the observational data , and can yield morphological parameters that vary systematically with total flux for galaxies with identical morphological profiles but different total luminosities ( see , e.g. , figure 9 of law et al . 2007b , lotz et al .",
    "2 .   many authors ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2000 , 2008 ; lotz et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) start with simple source extractor segmentation maps to either pre - select galaxy pixels or mask foreground / background objects , and apply either a circular or elliptical petrosian ( 1976 ) selection technique to select pixels independent of total galaxy flux or background noise characteristics .",
    "conselice et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2008 ) include in their segmentation map all pixels within 1.5 petrosian radii ( @xmath432 , i.e. , the radius at which the surface brightness is some fraction @xmath433 of the enclosed surface brightness ) , while lotz et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2006 ) include only pixels with flux greater than the surface brightness at the petrosian radius ( but following the potentially irregular isophotal contours ) .",
    "while robust to total source magnitude , cosmological dimming , and observational noise characteristics , these method can sometimes yield suboptimal results when applied to the often - irregular morphologies of @xmath241 galaxies ( e.g. , figure [ postage.fig ] ) because of their ill - defined petrosian radii .",
    "3 .   abraham et al . ( 2007 ) generalized the petrosian pixel selection method to work equally well for galaxies of arbitrary shapes whose flux components are not necessarily contiguous .",
    "as outlined by abraham et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , all pixels in the preliminary segmentation map calculated using source extractor are sorted in decreasing order of flux into the array @xmath102 , which is then used to construct the cumulative flux array @xmath434 .",
    "the quasi - petrosian isophote is set by determining the pixel index @xmath105 at which @xmath435 where @xmath436 is the cumulative mean surface brightness .",
    "this quasi - petrosian segmentation map preserves the advantages of petrosian - based methods ( i.e. , robustness to source magnitude , cosmological dimming , and observational noise ) while being applicable to arbitrary morphology .",
    "we adopt the quasi - petrosian method of abraham et al .",
    "( 2007 ) as our baseline segmentation method .",
    "as described by these authors , the failure mode of this approach is graceful in that , if the isophotal petrosian threshold @xmath433 is below the surface - brightness threshold of the initial source extractor segmentation map , it simply defaults to the initial map (  [ initialmap.sec ] ) .",
    "it is not desirable for this to occur frequently however , since it eliminates the advantages of the petrosian pixel selection .",
    "the isophotal threshold @xmath433 must therefore be set sufficiently high that it is more restrictive than a simple @xmath59 surface brightness cut , but sufficiently low that it rejects as little information ( i.e. , pixels ) as possible from the final segmentation maps .    in figure",
    "[ eta.fig ] , we plot the critical surface brightness threshold @xmath437 at which the pseudo - petrosian algorithm produces a segmentation map that is more restrictive than the initial source extractor @xmath59 surface - brightness segmentation map for each of our 306 galaxies .",
    "intuitively , there is a strong correlation with mean apparent surface brightness @xmath438 ( defined as the @xmath79 magnitude divided by the source extractor segmentation map area ) .",
    "we note that for the lowest mean surface brightness objects ( disproportionately galaxies of type iii and/or at redshifts @xmath439 ) @xmath437 is relatively high ; that is , the galaxy surface brightness decreases only slightly to @xmath68% of its mean value before reaching the @xmath59 sky background .",
    "in contrast , for higher surface brightness objects the dynamic range of the galaxy is greater and can decrease to @xmath360% or less of its mean value before reaching the sky background . given these results ,",
    "a traditional choice of @xmath440 would result in an unsatisfactorily high @xmath441% of our galaxies defaulting to a simple @xmath59 isophotal pixel selection . we therefore take @xmath442 instead , for which only @xmath443% of galaxies default to the surface - brightness limited segmentation map .",
    "this fraction decreases to @xmath444% when we reject from consideration galaxies with @xmath445 , for which we find that quantitative morphological statistics are not robust regardless of segmentation map ( see  [ magrobust.sec ] ) .    in figures [ robfig_seg.fig ] and [ robfig_seg2.fig ] we compare morphological statistics calculated using the following five segmentation maps :    1 ( ` qp3 ' ) : : :    quasi - petrosian segmentation map with threshold    @xmath157 , this is the default segmentation map .",

    "2004 ,    2006 ) but following the potentially irregular isophotal contours .",

    "we denote    statistics calculated using this map with subscripts of the form    ( e.g. ) @xmath451 .",
    "there is generally good correlation among the nonparametric statistics derived using each of these segmentation maps , especially when restricting our attention to the higher surface brightness systems for which the @xmath440 threshold is well - defined ( blue , black , and red points ) . in order to aid comparison between morphological properties derived by different groups in the literature",
    ", we present below a series of transformations that relate values calculated using different segmentation maps . in determining these relations",
    "we consider only those galaxies for which the @xmath440 threshhold is well - defined and the morphologies robust to statistical uncertainties ( i.e. , we require @xmath369 and @xmath452 ) , and perform a linear least squares fit with uniform uncertainties in both quantities .",
    "the greatest variation occurs in the gini parameter @xmath96 , which is extremely sensitive to the pixels included in the segmentation map ( see also a previous analysis by lisker 2008 ) .",
    "as illustrated by figure [ robfig_seg.fig ] ( bottom left - hand panel ) , simply adopting a petrosian threshold of @xmath447 significantly increases @xmath96 over the @xmath157 case by including more low - flux pixels in the segmentation map ( note that this effect is not as noticeable for the green - colored points , for which the dynamic range of the galaxy surface brightness did not permit the petrosian algorithm to reach the 20% flux threshold , and defaulted instead to the initial source extractor @xmath59 isophotal segmentation map ) .",
    "similarly , the cpl map also results in systematically higher values of @xmath96 than calculated by our default @xmath157 quasi - petrosian algorithm .",
    "this effect is even more noticeable in the cpc segmentation map ; this map increases the mean value of @xmath96 significantly by including many more low - surface brightness pixels than the other segmentation maps , and also compresses the dynamic range of @xmath96 among the galaxy sample . in contrast , the scaled surface - brightness selection technique ( sb ) stretches the dynamic range of @xmath96 , but corresponds poorly to estimates obtained using other segmentation maps .",
    "we find that the key transformations between these segmentation maps are given on average by : @xmath453 @xmath454    the second order moment of the light distribution ( @xmath97 ) is tightly correlated amongst all 5 segmentation maps , although values calculated using the cpc segmentation map lie at systematically lower values due to the inclusion of additional low surface - brightness pixels .",
    "the key transformations are described by : @xmath455 @xmath456    the concentration parameter @xmath98 exhibits minimal systematic offsets between segmentation maps , but considerably more scatter than the other morphological statistics . as discussed in ",
    "[ psrobust.sec ] this is primarily due to the poor sampling of the inner 20% of the light profile in the @xmath63 galaxies , which are small and poorly resolved in comparison to nearby galaxy samples ( see discussion by bershady et al .",
    "the key transformations are described by : @xmath457 @xmath458    the asymmetry parameter @xmath99 is also well correlated between different segmentation maps , with relatively little scatter and no significant systemic shifts amongst 4 of the 5 segmentation maps .",
    "there is more scatter and a systematic offset however when comparing estimates to the cpc segmentation map , with @xmath459 systematically lower compared to the other 4 segmentation maps .",
    "we find that the mean relations are governed by the equations @xmath460",
    "@xmath461    the tightest correlation is found for @xmath100 , for which all segmentation maps produce nearly identical values with only minimal scatter about the 1 - 1 relation .",
    "we perform monte carlo tests to quantify the mean and standard deviation of the morphological statistics for sources of fixed structure with different total magnitudes .",
    "we choose five sources ( four galaxies and reference star ; see top row of figure [ robfig.fig ] ) that are roughly representative of the range of morphologies found within our galaxy sample , and construct morphological models of them using galfit .",
    "we scale the total flux of these models to @xmath462 ab , and insert ten copies of each into randomly selected blank - field regions of the wfc3 images in order to obtain multiple realizations of the background noise .",
    "for each copy , we compute the segmentation maps and morphological parameters as described above in  [ stats.sec ] .",
    "this exercise is repeated every 0.5 mag in the range @xmath463 ab .",
    "figure [ robfig.fig ] suggests that while the morphological parameters are relatively robust for @xmath464 ab , at @xmath465 ab most start to break down either in the sense that their mean values deviate significantly from the mean values derived at brighter magnitudes , or the variance among different realizations of the background noise becomes large relative to the mean .",
    "this behavior for each statistic can be summarized as follows :    * @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 exhibit @xmath50 1/2/15% uncertainty ( averaged over the 4 star forming galaxy models ) at the bright end of the sample ( @xmath466 ab ) , increasing to 13/15/45% at the faint end ( @xmath467 ab ) .",
    "mean uncertainty at the average magnitude of the @xmath464 ab sample is 4/11/22% respectively ; in the case of @xmath98 this is sufficient to confuse the relative ordering between galaxies of different morphologies .",
    "there are no systematic variations with magnitude .",
    "* @xmath96 has a bright - end uncertainty @xmath468% , a faint - end uncertainty @xmath469% , and a mean uncertainty at the average magnitude of the @xmath464 ab sample of 3% .",
    "while the mean value of @xmath96 remains relatively constant down to @xmath470 ab , it decreases systematically at lower magnitudes .",
    "this systematic decline is because the @xmath471% surface brightness threshold for the quasi - petrosian pixel decreases below the @xmath59 source extractor threshold , resulting in effective loss of the lowest - flux pixels from the segmentation map .",
    "* @xmath100 has a bright - end uncertainty @xmath30% , a faint - end uncertainty @xmath472% , and a mean uncertainty at the average magnitude of the @xmath465 ab sample of 21% .",
    "@xmath100 systematically increases for @xmath473 ab , most noticeably for @xmath465 ab . * the sersic index @xmath108 and effective circularized radius @xmath119 have mean bright - end uncertainties of @xmath474% , faint - end uncertainties of @xmath475% , and mean uncertainties at the average magnitude of the @xmath464 ab sample of 15/2% respectively . both @xmath119 and @xmath108",
    "decline systematically with magnitude as it becomes progressively more difficult to distinguish faint outer regions of the galaxies from the background sky ( see also gray et al .",
    "these effects are particularly pronounced for @xmath465 ab .",
    "the significance of the decline in @xmath119 varies as a function of morphology ; regular symmetric objects show negligible variation across the full range @xmath476 ab , while more irregular multi - component galaxies may decline by as much as 30% .    in the interests of measuring physically meaningful morphological statistics",
    ", we therefore impose an apparent magnitude cut on our sample of galaxies at @xmath477 ab , corresponding closely to a signal - to - noise ratio cut @xmath478 ( see figure [ snr.fig ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the analyses of conselice et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and lisker et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who found ( respectively ) that @xmath99 became dominated by the background noise and that @xmath96 becomes less robust below @xmath479 .",
    "it is also worth investigating the dependence of the calculated morphological statistics on the pixel scale that we selected to drizzle our wfc3 data onto .",
    "we therefore inserted the galfit galaxy models ( normalized to @xmath480 ) from  [ magrobust.sec ] into random blank regions of the wfc3 fields , and rebinned the data using linear interpolation ( using the idl routine _ congrid _ , with conservation of total flux ) to a variety of pixel scales that we could realistically have chosen .",
    "as illustrated by figure [ robfigps.fig ] , the recovered morphologies are extremely robust to variations @xmath50 a factor of two in pixel scale , with the exception of the stellar source model ( for @xmath99 , @xmath98 , @xmath97 , and @xmath96 ) and the concentration parameter @xmath98 ( for the stellar source , q1009-bx146 , and q1700-bx691 ) .",
    "that is , all of the morphological parameters can vary unsatisfactorily with choice of sampling scale for unresolved objects , or ( in the case of @xmath98 ) for objects in which the innermost region containing 20% of the light is poorly sampled .",
    "indeed , we note that while @xmath98 is not robust for q1009-bx146 and q1700-bx691 , it is more so for q1700-bx759 and q1217-md20 because these two galaxies are significantly more spatially extended and the central region containing 20% of the total light correspondingly better sampled .",
    "this resolution dependence of @xmath98 for the poorly sampled inner radius @xmath481 is well - known in the literature ( see , e.g. , figure 9 of bershady et al .",
    "2000 ) .    given the general robustness of the morphological parameters to the choice of angular sampling scale , we do not make any corrections to the measured morphologies due to the small ( @xmath482% ) change in angular size subtended by a physical kpc across the redshift interval @xmath43 , but we choose not to use the concentration parameter @xmath98 in our analyses .",
    "we also explore the robustness of the morphological statistics to the width of the observational psf , which affects the degree to which spatial structures are resolved . in order to reliably trace structures resolved on scales smaller than the wfc3/ir psf we repeat the analysis from  [ magrobust.sec ] , but using galfit models of five sources in the q1700 + 64 field observed with hst / acs f814w as part of program go-10581 ( pi : shapley ; see description in peter et al .",
    "these models are convolved with 2d gaussian profiles ( using the idl routine _ filter_image _ ) to mimic observations with psf fwhm ranging from 0.1 ( i.e. , native resolution for the f814w imaging data ) - 0.3 arcsec .    as illustrated in figure [ robfigpsf.fig ]",
    ", there is little change in the statistical uncertainty of the morphological measurements with psf fwhm , but most exhibit systematic variations ( as noted previously by , e.g. , lotz et al .",
    "2004 , 2008b ) . as discussed in  [ psrobust.sec ] , @xmath98 is poorly behaved since the inner 20% of the light profile is poorly sampled . as psf fwhm increases , the dynamic range of @xmath99 , @xmath97 , @xmath96 , and @xmath100 decreases , approaching the limit that when the psf is large compared to the size of the galaxies all objects will be unresolved and have indistinguishable morphologies .",
    "the compression of the dynamical range is less pronounced for objects such as acs / bx1031 which have two well - separated components that require a more substantial change in the psf to lose information about the double morphological structure .",
    "similarly , the parametric statistics @xmath119 and @xmath108 are generally quite stable to variations in the psf since galfit incorporates the observational psf in its fitting algorithm , although @xmath108 declines by a few percent from fwhm @xmath347 arcsec to @xmath8 arcsec .",
    "this effect was previously noted by buitrago et al .",
    "( 2008 ) who found that sersic indices measured in the infrared with nicmos were @xmath483% smaller than measured in the optical with acs .",
    "since all of our galaxies have been observed with uniform coverage and a psf that varies by less than @xmath50 4% , the trends illustrated in figure [ robfigpsf.fig ] will be unimportant for internal comparisons between the morphologies of galaxies in our sample .",
    "these trends will be important , however , to keep in mind when comparing any of our galaxies to low - redshift samples , or to similar @xmath15 galaxies observed with _",
    "hst _ in bandpasses tracing the rest - frame uv .",
    "let the ellipsoid be a surface in 3-space characterized by the scale lengths @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath484 . adopting spherical polar coordinates , the surface of the ellipsoid",
    "is defined by @xmath485 where @xmath48 is the azimuthal angle @xmath486 and @xmath83 the polar angle @xmath487 .    rather than rotating the ellipsoid ,",
    "consider the identical problem in which the viewer is located at a large distance along the direction described by @xmath488 and @xmath489 , the azimuthal and polar angles respectively .",
    "the unit vector in the direction of the viewer @xmath490 may be written as @xmath491    at each point on the surface of the ellipsoid there is a corresponding tangent plane ; by definition , the ` edge ' of the figure as seen by the viewer is located where the unit vector towards the viewer is parallel to the tangent plane . if @xmath492 is the normal to the tangent plane , then the projected ellipse observed by the viewer is described by the set of @xmath493 such that @xmath494    since the tangent plane to the ellipsoid is described by the partial derivatives @xmath495 and @xmath496 , the normal to the tangent plane may be constructed by the cross product of these vectors : @xmath497    setting @xmath498 we obtain the relation @xmath499 for all @xmath500 ( i.e. , viewing the ellipsoid perfectly edge - on ) , @xmath48 along the projected ellipse attains all values in the range @xmath501 . by setting @xmath502 , @xmath503 , ... , @xmath504 and calculating the corresponding @xmath83 from equation [ beta.eqn ] it is possible to obtain a set of ( @xmath493 ) pairs fully describing the projected ellipse .    the projected radius @xmath505 of the ellipse , as seen by the viewer , at each ( @xmath493 ) is given by the magnitude of the cross product of the vector @xmath506 to the point on the surface with the unit vector on the line of sight to the viewer @xmath490 : @xmath507 some computation gives the vector components of @xmath508 as @xmath509    the magnitude @xmath505 is then simply @xmath510 and the axis ratio of the projected ellipse may be trivially calculated as the ratio of the minimum and maximum value of @xmath505 for all ( @xmath493 ) coordinate pairs : @xmath511    it can be verified that in the limit where two axes have equal length equation [ baellip.eqn ] gives identical results to the thick - disk case derived by hubble ( 1926 ) and described by equation [ hubble.eqn ] ."
