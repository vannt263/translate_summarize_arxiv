    "we also do not know whether new phase of matter - quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) - is actually produced .",
    "one well - known strategy addressing these issues relies on ( very rare ) processes happening at earlier stages , the e / m probes @xcite or @xmath0 suppression ( see section 5 ) . both lead to exciting experimental findings , much discussed at this conference",
    ".    another approach ( to be mostly discussed in this talk ) is based on hadronic observables , well measured now in high - statistics experiments . although re - scatterings tend to erase most traces of the dense stage , some of them are preserved and @xmath2 during the expansion : _ collective flow _ is one of them .",
    "existing data strongly suggest that the hadronic system does indeed behave as a truly macroscopic one .",
    "rather detailed phenomenology of the so called @xmath3 flow was covered here by ollitrault , so i focus on @xmath4 ( axially symmetric ) flow flow was discussed in multiple hydro - based works . however , due to uncertainty in initial conditions , predictive power of hydrodynamics is rather limited .",

    "its very existence was widely debated for years , but ( although at qm97 we have still witnessed remnants of this debate ) it seems to be proven now `` beyond a reasonable doubt '' .",
    "the hbt data , coulomb effects ( or any reasonable event generator ) show that transverse size at freeze - out significantly exceed that of parent nuclei .",
    "an excellent test for existence of the flow is provided by deuterons .",
    "the shape of their spectrum , its slope @xmath5 and even @xmath6 are all very sensitive to it .",
    "the flow implies a correlation between position and momentum , which helps to produce deuterons .",
    "if this correlation is removed ( see @xcite , where in rqmd output the nucleon s positions or momenta were interchanged ) deuteron spectra dramatically change .",
    "phenomenology of the @xmath7 slopes , @xmath8 , is qualitatively explained by flow .",
    "however , looking at it quantitatively one finds that their understanding should be improved .",
    "true , one may get a very good fit with some velocity profiles and @xmath9 decoupling temperature @xmath10 .",
    "but the spectra allow for multiple fits , with wide trade - offs between @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , those fits are based on grossly oversimplified picture : ( i ) the ad hoc profiles do not correspond to hydro with a realistic eos ; ( ii ) the main assumption - for all secondaries one should expect the same @xmath12 and @xmath10 - obviously contradicts to elementary kinetics .",
    "different secondaries do have very different cross sections , and therefore decouple from flow at different times .    as one can see from experimental talks at this conference ,",
    "by now we have rich experimental systematics of @xmath7 slopes .",
    "first of all ( as shown by na44 at qm96 ) , the slopes have very strong a dependence .",
    "while the pp data show no trace of the radial flow ( as noted long ago @xcite ) , it is seen for nuclear collisions .",
    "furthermore , @xmath11 is increased by about factor two from ss to pbpb .",
    "such trend qualitatively contradicts to predictions of most of the hydro models in literature , with a - independent freeze - out .",
    "then there is significant dependence on particle species : while @xmath13 slopes show about linear increase with the particle mass .",
    "new data for strange hadrons @xmath14 deviate from this line .",
    "( this does not mean that they do not flow together with others for some time - they may be just decoupled earlier , due to smaller cross sections . )    the next point : data show strong @xmath15 dependence of the radial flow .",

    "it is very important to know what happens in between : most probably there exist a maximum at some energy .",

    "the longitudinal and transverse expansion are not qualitatively different , while at sps the @xmath22 flow has already distinct ultra - relativistic features , most isotherms being close to bjorken hyperbola @xmath23 .",
    "less obvious observation ( resulting from particular eos with the qcd phase transition ) is a dramatic difference in the @xmath24 expansion .",
    "the ags case can be described as `` burning in '' , the lines of constant energy density moves inward with some small constant speed .",
    "at sps the mixed phase matter burns into the low density hadron gas at a cylinder ( known also as a `` burning log '' ) , which has nearly time - independent transverse radius 6 - 8 fm .",
    "we have already remarked that in order to explain flow ( and many other things ) quantitatively , the hydro solution should be complimented with ( well known ! )",
    "kinetics of the dilute hadron matter at the end .",
    "so the @xmath25 objective of @xcite was to create a _ next generation _ hydro - kinetic model for heavy ion collisions , hkm for short .",

    "i ) thermodynamics of hadronic matter , ( ii ) hydrodynamics of its expansion , and ( iii ) realistic hadronic kinetics at the freeze - out , plus practically important ( iv ) resonance decays .",
    "most elements of the model have in fact been worked out in literature , some are new , but they are practically taken together for the first time .    before we go into specifics ,",
    "let us make brief comments on literature .",
    "many hydro - based works have parameterized the initial conditions in a way which results in rough reproduction of the @xmath26 spectra of different species , but none so far addressed the details of the radial flow systematics discussed above .",
    "probably the closest in spirit to our work is recent paper @xcite    the cascade `` event generators '' ( fritjof , venus , rqmd , arc etc ) are widely used , and ( at least ) rqmd provides a reasonable radial flow .",
    "( they are much more beloved by experimentalists than theorists , who of course know that all of thesem models know nothing about qgp , and thus _ directly contradict _ to qcd theory / lattice . )",
    "hydrodynamics and cascades are not physics alternatives , but just complementary tools , most useful for dense and dilute conditions , respectively .",
    "these days , with approaching rhic / lhc , one has to work with thousands of secondaries .",
    "direct simulation of all re - scatterings are neither practical not necessary : as soon as the system becomes much larger than the correlation length , it can be cut into independent `` cells '' . the most reasonable strategy for",
    "rhic / lhc is , to my mind , a combination ( parton cascade)-(hydro)-(hadronic cascade ) .",
    "one should make clear distinction between @xmath27 and @xmath28 freeze - outs .",
    "reactions changing particle composition have cross sections very different from those for elastic collisions . in most hydro - based papers published so far",
    "it was however ignored , and the expansion was simply cut off at fixed t , usually about 140 mev .",
    "it is clear now that at sps chemical freeze - out happens at @xmath29 mev , while thermal one occurs ( for heavy ions , in their center ) to temperatures as low as @xmath30 .",
    "it does not look like a huge difference , but in terms of density , space - time picture and flow it is is crucial .",
    "extra few fm / c time available at the end for heavy ion collisions ( pbpb relative to ss ) leads to  extra push \" by stiff hadronic gas , especially for nucleons .",
    "( this is where the twice stronger collective flow for heavy ions comes from . )    apart of flow , there are of course other means to verify the difference between chemical and thermal freeze - outs .",
    "if they do not coincide , the chemical potentials can not stay at zero .",
    "the effect should in fact be directly observable in @xmath31 distribution of pions with the same sign . ] as extra low @xmath31 enhancement ( on top of resonance decays ) .",
    "we have calculated that for central pbpb at sps it should reach @xmath32 .",

    "the larger is the system , the lower is @xmath37 on this surface .",
    "furthermore , the shape of the freeze - out surface is very different from that of isotherms .",
    "it means that there is a significant variation of this temperature over the surface itself : in order to find the coolest pion gas , one should look at the very center of central collisions of heaviest nuclei at highest energy !",
    "the improved freeze - out condition leads to huge difference for the flow .",

    "the available literature is mostly devoted to the former possibility , while we study the latter one .",
    "the oldest ( and the simplest idea @xcite ) is that if quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is formed , its free gluons can rather easily `` ionize '' charmonium states by photo - effect - type reaction @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "another idea @xcite is that successive charmonium levels @xmath48 should `` melt '' ( fail to exist ) at increasing density due to debye screening in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",

    "`` melting '' scenario implies existence of certain @xmath49 as a function of energy density , and one can indeed expect rapid onset of the suppression .",

    "although the realistic model of this type is yet to be worked out , this scenario may be potentially successful .    in view of na50 data , scenario based on the gluonic  photo - effect \" has problems . like any other probabilistic process ( `` co - mover '' absorption ) it can not create discontinuous behavior by itself",
    ". therefore an additional hypothesis was made @xcite - it is the _ formation _ of qgp which is discontinuous , it happens suddenly after a certain critical energy density @xmath51 is reached .",
    "but thermodynamics tells us that in a first - order phase transition there is discontinuity in @xmath52 but not in _ energy density _ : the mixed phase interpolates linearly between the energy densities of the two phases , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "relying on non - equilibrium fluctuations require too much fine tuning .",
    "furthermore , this scenario has a phenomenological problem : any sudden transition into qgp phase at some @xmath51 results in a jump of the total entropy produced , while the data on @xmath55 does not seem to have a jump at @xmath56 .",
    "we have mentioned above that qcd phase transition leads to a very non - trivial eos , with a deep minimum in @xmath57 at the `` softest point '' , @xmath58 .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite ( see also later study @xcite ) that hydrodynamical expansion with such eos has a non - monotonous dependence on initial conditions .",
    "when initial energy density is close to the `` softest point '' , the expansion is more slow . as a result , the qgp lifetime has a peak as a function of collision energy ( or impact parameter b ) , increasing by significant factor ( 2 - 3 ) , as compared to that at central collisions at sps .    in @xcite",
    "we study whether the non - trivial features of @xmath0 suppression can be explained by such increase in the qgp lifetime .",
    "before we go into specifics , let us point out qualitative differences between this scenario and the one based on @xmath0 `` melting '' .",
    "the main difference is that in the latter case the complete suppression of corresponding charmonium states are assumed for @xmath59 @xmath60 , while in our case the anomaly is concentrated around @xmath61 and at larger @xmath50 the survival probability @xmath62 back .    estimating initial dependence of energy density ( e.g. by `` wounded nucleon model '' )",
    ", one can see that indeed the impact parameter @xmath63 in pbpb collision roughly corresponds to the `` softest point '' .",
    "the hydro expansion for non - central collisions is complicated by the so called directed flow . fortunately for @xmath0 suppression one may ignore it : expansion is predominantly longitudinal during the first few fermi / c .",
    "so , assuming that absorption rates are unchanged , we study whether changes in qgp lifetime can affect @xmath0 suppression and reproduce na50 data .",
    "the main problem here is `` leakage '' of @xmath0 from the system , which limits the sensitivity of @xmath0 yield to the qgp lifetime .",
    "we have reproduce known observables ( distribution in transverse energy @xmath43 and its correlation with b ) by a small monte carlo model . for pb(158-geva)-pb collisions at given impact parameter it generates charmonium states , which are filtered through nuclear absorption , and then put in a hot de - confined medium .",
    "the survival probability in it is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the time spent in this medium ( see fig.[suppression](a ) ) and @xmath66 is the `` ionization '' rate .",
    "@xmath66 is chosen to match the observed suppression for central events.to calculate the time inside plasma we need to distribute these events in coordinate and momentum space .",
    "the distribution in the transverse plane is given by glauber theory , like in @xcite and the distribution in the longitudinal direction is presumed uniform .",
    "the question is then whether this `` semi - realistic '' model provides good description of na50 data at all b , especially near the discontinuity , the result of the calculation is shown in in fig.@xmath67[suppression](b ) .",
    "because the usual glauber - type absorption on nucleons describes well the p - a and light lighter ion data ( not shown ) as well as peripheral pbpb data , we take it out of the picture , plotting only @xmath68 from it . as one",
    "can see from fig.@xmath67[suppression](b ) , the increased qgp lifetime leads to additional suppression for intermediate @xmath69 .",
    "`` leakage '' and other smearing effects do not allow to reproduce a jump seen in data , as expected .",

    "particularly , it reproduces vanishingly small slope of the suppression in this region .    potentially important way to separate different suppression mechanisms",

    "we have therefore calculated @xmath71 vs. @xmath72 , see fig.@xmath67[suppression](c ) .",
    "the usual initial state parton re - scattering leads to @xmath73 growing with @xmath43 .",
    "however , if @xmath0 produced in the central region are destroyed and only peripheral ones survive , then ( as suggested by kharzeev et al ) this dependence becomes inverted , with a decrease at most central collisions .",
    "our scenario leads to intermediate flat dependence , because some @xmath0 from the center may still `` leak '' out .",
    "it was encouraging to see that na50 data ( first shown at this conference after my talk ) show exactly such dependence !",
    "finally , in @xcite we have also discussed the conversion of @xmath0 into its spin partner @xmath74 .",
    "this channel is one more potential `` sink '' for @xmath0 and to our knowledge has not been investigated previously : however our estimates of the rate of conversion show that it hardly can be essential .",
    "event - by - event fluctuations are deviations of mean value of some observable calculated in an event , relative to that averaged over the whole ensemble of events . in general , those can be of @xmath75 or of @xmath76 nature , and i focus on the latter ones ( which are guaranteed to be there ) .",
    "their sensitivity to some non - trivial details of the dynamics were first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "it was noticed that dispersion of the @xmath77 distribution strongly depends on a cascade model used . in particular , those based on `` initial rescatterings '' or superposition of independent pp events predicted much larger fluctuations , compared to models with multiple re - scattering of secondaries . this paper has triggered experimental studies ( reported at qm97 by roland ) : the fluctuations observed by the na49 experiment were found to be perfect gaussian for several orders of magnitude , without any unusual tails .",

    "the essence of it is that the total @xmath78 generated in the collisions shows up in the magnitude of fluctuations . in general , any statistical fluctuations can be derived from the famous boltzmann expression relating entropy s and probability p , written in the einstein form @xmath79 .",

    "it is an extensive quantity @xmath85 , proportional to the total volume ( or the number of particles n ) of the system , so the relative fluctuations are @xmath86 as expected .",
    "the key point @xcite is that @xmath84 has strong t - dependence , which can be used as a  thermometer \" . in the vicinity of the qcd phase transition",
    "@xmath84 has a peak .",

    "we argued above that larger systems cool to lower @xmath10 .",
    "therefore we end up with a ( counter - intuitive ) prediction : ( properly scaled ) fluctuations for ( central ) heavy ion collisions should show _ stronger _ fluctuations compared to medium ions or peripheral collisions .    the second example @xcite deals with fluctuations of occupation of particular bins in the histograms . deviations from trivial poisson statistics are induced by quantum statistics",

    "finally , if there are dynamical low momentum excess pions ( e.g. due to dcc ) one should observe even larger fluctuations in the corresponding bins .",
    "the main result of our studies of the radial flow in central collisions can be understood in hydro framework only if the special care is taken about the freeze - out .",
    "when it is properly done , all puzzles are gone and the `` standard '' lattice - based eos _ including softness due to the qcd phase transition _ approximately describe the data , for all ions , both at ags and sps",
    ". further work , in combination with elliptic flow data , is however needed to tell if this description is unique .    one significant conclusionis existence of a rather large gap between `` chemical '' and `` thermal '' freeze - outs . for central pbpb collisions at sps",
    "the former corresponds to @xmath92 while the latter ( in the very center ) cools down to @xmath93 .",
    "if so , the non - zero chemical potential for pions should appear : there are first indication for reality of this efect in na44 data . completely new set of ideas has recently emerged , relating event - by - event fluctuations and thermodynamics .",
    "potentially it is very useful way to learn more about the freeze - out conditions .",
    "it is also relatively simple tool for large - acceptance detectors like na49 or stars .",
    "finally , the non - trivial eos leads to non - monotonous energy / impact parameter dependence of the dense matter lifetime , with the maximum corresponding to the `` softest point '' @xcite .",
    "we have speculated above that this effect contributes to @xmath0 suppression , and suggested a particular model to be compared with data .",
