    "very massive ob associations are objects of intense interest . given that the association birthrate ( @xmath5 ) is observed to vary with association mass ( @xmath6 ) as @xmath7 @xcite , or possibly slightly flatter , a large portion of each galaxy s star formation occurs within its most massive ob associations .",
    "giant ob associations are most capable of disrupting their gaseous environment , from their natal molecular clouds to the entire galactic neighborhood , and they inflate superbubbles which erupt from the disk , feeding a galactic halo or fountain .",
    "they sculpt and illuminate the giant regions seen in distant galaxies and are a notable feature of starburst evolution .",
    "being the most extreme examples of intense star formation in the current universe , they are laboratories for the physics of star cluster formation such as environmental influences on the initial mass function , formation of very massive stars , and dynamical evolution with rapid stellar evolution .    although several of the brightest known ob associations within the milky way approach ` super star cluster ' status ( @xmath8 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is possible that even more luminous associations have escaped detection because of severe extinction and confusion in the galactic plane .",
    "for instance , the galactic ob associations with the largest known ionizing output , @xmath9 , are those powering the ngc 3603 , arches , quintuplet , and galactic center regions ( @xmath10s@xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively : @xcite ) ; however , the upper limit of the milky way association distribution is estimated to be even brighter ( @xmath13s@xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite identified 40 star - forming complexes within the 13 most luminous ( @xmath15 s@xmath2 ) free - free emission regions observed by wmap and catalogued by @xcite .",
    "many of these complexes are potential hosts to embedded super star clusters .",
    "of particular interest is the most luminous unconfused star - forming complex located at ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) = ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) with a kinematic distance of 9.7 kpc . with an output of @xmath10s@xmath20 ,",
    "the stars powering this region may represent the milky way s most luminous ob association .",
    "( we refer to this region and its cluster as g298 or , inspired by its 8@xmath21 m appearance , as the ` dragonfish nebula ' : figure [ rgbfig ] . )",
    "the region appears in 8@xmath21 m as a closed bubble surrounded by a prominent shell .",
    "previous searches using near - infrared ( nir ) point source catalogs from 2mass @xcite and spitzer glimpse @xcite have concentrated on the brightest regions of free - free emission around the shell and relied on integrated source counts . although some clustering was discovered in these studies ( figure [ fig : stellardens ] ) , the central ionizing association is yet undiscovered .    in this letter",
    ", we identify a candidate for the central ob association powering the dragonfish , primarily by applying a color selection to the 2mass catalogue .",

    "[ rgbfig ] ]",
    "only very luminous stars of deeply embedded ob associations are visible due to distance and extinction . whether the association can be identified using the 2mass point source catalogue @xcite depends on the ob association radius and field star density .",
    "radii in the range 1030pc are likely since most associations , irrespective of mass , are disrupted immediately after birth @xcite .",
    "ob association birthsites in the milky way have a limited range of mass column densities , @xmath22g@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "turbulent linewidths in these birthsites are @xmath24g@xmath25^{1/4}$ ] kms@xmath2 , for associations of mass @xmath26 which form with efficiency @xmath27 from a region with turbulent virial parameter @xmath28 . crossing and formation timescales",
    "are both shorter than the ionizing lifetime and the terminal expansion speed of an ob association is likely to be @xmath29 . for an association of @xmath30 , an age between 24 myr , and an expansion speed between 46 kms@xmath2",
    ", we therefore expect an expanding population currently 824pc in radius , possibly surrounding a dense core which survived the disruption event . for a physical radius @xmath31 pc with the ionizing luminosity of the dragonfish",
    "as measured from wmap , the association source density is @xmath32 arcmin@xmath33 .",
    "we measure the 2mass source population density in the galactic plane to be @xmath34 arcmin@xmath33 . for @xmath35pc",
    "the association dominates raw 2mass source counts , whereas for @xmath36pc it is a minor variation of the 2mass population which is difficult to detect using raw source counts .",
    "the nir color information provides an additional avenue to search for the embedded associations .",
    "we make use of this in the search for the embedded association within the dragonfish .",
    "ionization from a coeval stellar population drops sharply after 4 myr as its most massive and powerful stars turn off the main sequence , so it is unlikely , though not impossible , that g298 s ionizing population is any older .",
    "the ionizing population is sufficiently rich ( @xmath37s@xmath2 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to fully sample the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) ; its very massive stars should still be present and visible .",
    "the association is likely highly extinguished , even if it has cleared its natal cloud . at a distance of 9.7 kpc the fiducial distance - extinction relationship within the galactic disk , @xmath38 @xcite ,",
    "predicts @xmath39 ; this corresponds to a @xmath40-band extinction @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the @xcite extinction law , which is steeper than that of @xcite .",
    "we rely primarily on the 2mass point source catalog for our analysis , but use three additional data sets to check for consistency : the usno - b catalog of visible magnitudes , the spitzer glimpse catalog at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath21 m , and deeper j and h band photometry of a small section of the candidate .    for our search",
    ", we target main - sequence , massive stars , at a distance of @xmath42 kpc and an extinction of around @xmath43 .",
    "further , association members visible in all three bands have spectral types of roughly b1 or earlier , so their intrinsic emission in the nir bands ( @xmath44 m ) is entirely in the rayleigh - jeans limit ( @xmath45 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the predicted extinction",
    ", nir colors should be @xmath46 .",
    "association sources should lie in a tight group along the reddening vector from this common initial color .",
    "if the upper imf follows the @xcite slope to an upper limit of 120 @xmath47 , we expect @xmath48 members with confident nir colors ( @xmath49<[15.9,15.0,14.3]$ ] , for which the signal - to - noise ratio exceeds five in all bands )",
    ". note that if the association is older than 4myr or is not coeval , it must be even more numerous because more stars are required to make up for the missing ionization from the top of the main sequence .",
    "the first steps of our analysis are to select sources with the color of an early - type star behind a range of extinctions bracketing the expected value , to test for a statistically significant overdensity within the confines of the 8@xmath21 m bubble , and then to vary the adopted extinction range in order to optimize the statistical significance of the overdensity . in practice",
    "we determine source density using the angular offset @xmath50 between a source and its @xmath51th neighbour , as @xmath52 , and use @xmath53 to reduce poisson noise at some expense in resolution .",
    "once the angular scale of the putative association is determined , we assess its significance by comparing source density within this region to the mean @xmath54 and standard deviation @xmath55 of those within independent , identically - sized regions in a 2-degree field centered on , but excluding , the 8@xmath21 m bubble .",
    "statistical significance is measured by @xmath56 .",
    "once a candidate is identified , we check that the same procedure applied to regions outside the 8@xmath21 m bubble yields no candidates of similar significance .",
    "we then examine the color - color and color - magnitude diagrams ( ccds and cmds ) of similarly - sized regions to check that an apparent overdensity is not caused by features of the distribution of stars and extinction .",
    "based on the expected source colors from ",
    "[ s : feasibility ] , we apply a nir color cut of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , corresponding to colors of hot stars with @xmath59 . within the color cut , the 2-degree diameter field encompassing the dragonfish",
    "has a mean stellar density @xmath60 arcmin@xmath33 , which we refer to as the field star density .",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath61 averaged over association - sized regions is @xmath62 arcmin@xmath33 .",
    "we find a significant overdensity of stars in the dragonfish nebula at ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) = ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) , located inside the shell of the star forming complex ( figure  [ fig : stellardens ] ) .",
    "the 1@xmath65 stellar overdensity contour ( @xmath66 ) has semimajor and semiminor axes ( 11 , 10 ) , corresponding to ( 31 , 28)pc ; however , the association may extend beyond the observational limit .",
    "the peak of the overdensity is @xmath67 arcmin@xmath33 , 8-@xmath65 above the background level on cluster - sized regions , adopting the 100th nearest neighbor .",
    "the region contains 897 sources within the adopted boundaries . subtracting the contribution due to background sources , the candidate association is composed of @xmath4 sources , consistent with the value determined based on the chosen imf and measured luminosity (   [ s : feasibility ] ) . using the 1@xmath65 boundaries , the mean density of the association is @xmath68 .",
    "we refer to the candidate as the `` dragonfish association '' .",
    "the association is strongly concentrated within the central @xmath69 , but contains an extended asymmetric envelope .",
    "the central , dense , symmetrical region has a stellar density which depends as @xmath70 with @xmath71 for @xmath72 , where the value of @xmath28 depends on the assumed density of field sources . at larger radii",
    "the azimuthally averaged density drops more rapidly , but is dominated by the asymmetries visible in figure 1 .",
    "half the excess sources are found within @xmath73 , or @xmath74 pc , similar to the half - light radii of other galactic ob associations @xcite .",
    "assuming half the projected mass falls within this radius , and assigning a total mass of @xmath75 we infer that the association s central regions are older than their virial crossing times , whereas its outskirts are not ( @xmath76 myr ) .",
    "it therefore seems likely to be unbound on the whole @xcite but to contain a bound core ; however this bears further investigation .",
    "using the usno and spitzer glimpse catalogues , we are able to confirm that the stars identified in the dragonfish association have magnitudes and colors consistent with ob stars with the stated extinction , but not further able to distinguish the association population from the background . in the glimpse wavelengths ( @xmath77 ) , this is because nearly all stars have identical , rayleigh - jeans colors , whereas with the usno wavelengths ( @xmath78 ) , the spectral energy distribution is strongly dominated by the extinction .",

    "[ binnedcm ] ]    given that the colors of these underdense sources are separated from those of the putative ob association by a vector which is nearly parallel to the extinction vector , could the association be only an illusion caused by intervening extinction with @xmath88 ?",

    "in fact the missing sources are about half as numerous as the surplus ones .",

    "we also find no evidence for any shadowing features which would indicate a strong extinction feature .",
    "this supports our conclusion that the apparent association is not an extinction feature .",

    "we simulate the field in the direction and with the size of the dragonfish association , using the 2mass limiting magnitudes from  [ s : feasibility ] , and a diffuse extinction law of 1.6 @xmath94 .",
    "the model background population underestimates the total number of sources .",
    "however , we find that the majority of stars within the color cut are early k giant stars with masses between 1 and 3 m@xmath95 and distances between 3.0 and 4.5 kpc ; we assume these represent our contaminating sources .",
    "we have used the 2mass point source catalogue to search for the central ob association within the dragonfish nebula by analyzing the on - sky stellar density with nir colors consistent with extinguished o stars .",
    "we find an overdensity of point sources within the bubble at an extinction range of @xmath96 .",
    "comparing the ccd and cmd of the candidate association with the surrounding field , we confirm the presence of the overdensity at the chosen color range .",
    "we reject an extinction explanation for the overdensity and infer that the contaminating star population consists predominantly of k giants 3 - 4.5 kpc away .",
    "our candidate association contains @xmath4 members visible in 2mass with magnitudes consistent with o and early - b stars , similar to the ionizing population expected from the region s free - free luminosity .",
    "we infer from its assumed mass , radius , and maximum age that it is likely to be unbound on the whole but may contain a bound core ; however further investigation is necessary to determine its dynamical state .",
    "this is a candidate for the most luminous ( and consequently the most massive ) ob association in the galaxy .",
