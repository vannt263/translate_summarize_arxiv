    "amongst the major shortcomings of the standard model are the neutrino mass and the dark matter problems .",
    "underpinning the origin of neutrino mass and elucidating the nature of dark matter would constitute a gigantic step forward in particle physics .",
    "here we focus on the possibility that the neutrino mass and dark matter problems may be closely interconnected  @xcite .",
    "concerning neutrino mass a major unknown is whether neutrinos are their own anti ",
    "particles , an issue which has remained an open challenge ever since ettore majorana s pioneer idea on the quantum mechanics of spin . on the other hand , since many years physicists have pondered about what is the dark matter made of , and what makes it stable , a property usually assumed in an _ ad - hoc _ fashion   and @xmath1 symmetries have already been considered in the literature  @xcite . ] .",
    "indeed , although the existence of non - baryonic dark matter is well established by using cosmological and astrophysical probes , its nature has otherwise remained elusive  @xcite .",
    "the detection of neutrinoless double beta decay would be a major step in particle physics since , according to the black  box theorem  @xcite it would not only demonstrate that lepton number is violated in nature , but also imply that neutrinos are of majorana type . on the other hand , the fact that the weak interaction is v - a turns this quest into a major challenge  @xcite . as of now the nature of neutrinos remains as mysterious as the mechanism responsible for generating their small masses .",
    "little is known regarding the nature of its associated messenger particles , the underlying mass scale or its flavor structure  @xcite , currently probed only in neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite . here",
    "we assume that neutrinos are dirac particles .",
    "realizing this possibility requires extra assumptions beyond the standard electroweak gauge invariance .",
    "one approach is to extend the gauge group itself , for example , by using the gauge structure due to its special features  @xcite . in this framework",
    "it has recently been shown how to obtain a type - ii seesaw mechanism for dirac neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "using unconventional lepton charges for right handed neutrinos  @xcite and gauging @xmath2 can also lead to dirac neutrinos within the type - i seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may stick to the gauge structure but use extra flavor symmetries implying a conserved lepton number , so as to obtain dirac neutrinos , as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "in this letter we focus on having neutrinos as dirac particles as a result of the cyclic symmetry @xmath0 , which plays the role of a discrete version of lepton number , we call _",
    "quarticity_. we show that a wimp dark matter candidate can naturally emerge , stabilized by quarticity , the same symmetry associated to the diracness of neutrinos . in sect .",
    "[ sec : model- ] we sketch in some detail the required particle content of the model and demonstrate how the dirac nature of neutrinos and the stability of dark matter follow from the same principle . in sect .",
    "[ sec : dark - matter ] we discuss the main aspects concerning our wimp dark matter candidate , including a brief discussion of the interactions relevant for determining its relic density .",
    "we also discuss its direct detection potential through the higgs portal mechanism .",
    "finally we summarize our results in sect .",
    "[ sec : summary - conclusions- ] .",
    "our model is based on the discrete symmetry @xmath3 where @xmath0 is the cyclic group of order four and @xmath4 is the cyclic group of order two . the group @xmath0 can be viewed as a discrete version of lepton number . as we show here , @xmath0 symmetry not only forbids majorana terms but also forbids couplings of potential dark matter candidate ensuring stability .",
    "thus , the same symmetry which implies the dirac nature of neutrinos also ensures the stability of dark matter . the @xmath4 symmetry is required here to ensure the seesaw origin of neutrino mass , by forbidding tree level coupling between the left and right handed neutrinos .",
    "+ the particle content of our model along with the @xmath0 charge assignments of the particles are as shown in table [ tab1 ] .    .",

    "@xmath9 denotes the fourth root of unity , i.e. @xmath10 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ tab1 ] , @xmath11 ; @xmath12 are the lepton doublets which have charge @xmath9 under @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath13 ; @xmath14 are the charged lepton singlets which carry @xmath0charge @xmath9 .",
    "apart from the standard model fermions , the model also includes three right  handed neutrinos @xmath15 transforming as singlets under the gauge group and with charge @xmath9 under @xmath0 .",
    "we also add three gauge singlet dirac fermions @xmath16 ; @xmath17 with charge @xmath9 under @xmath0 , as shown in table",
    ".  [ tab1 ] .",
    "all the fermions except @xmath15 are even under the @xmath4 symmetry , while @xmath15 are odd .    in the scalar sector",
    "the @xmath18 transforms as @xmath19 doublet , does not carry any @xmath0 charge and is even under @xmath4 symmetry . on the other hand",
    "the real scalar @xmath6 is a gauge singlet , carries no @xmath20 charge but is odd under @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "we also add two other gauge singlet scalars @xmath7 and @xmath8 both of which carry @xmath0 charges @xmath9 and @xmath21 respectively and are even under @xmath4 . the fact that @xmath22 allows us to take the field @xmath8 also to be real .",
    "+ the @xmath23 @xmath3 invariant yukawa lagrangian for the leptons is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , are the yukawa couplings . also @xmath27 is the @xmath19 conjugate field , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the second pauli matrix .",
    "after symmetry breaking the @xmath0 neutral scalars @xmath30 acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath31 the @xmath0 charged scalars @xmath32 acquire no vev thus ensuring that the @xmath0 symmetry remains unbroken even after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "since the scalar @xmath6 was odd under @xmath4 symmetry , its vev breaks the @xmath4 symmetry spontaneously .",
    "the neutrinos can then acquire a tiny mass through type - i dirac seesaw mechanism as shown in fig .",
    "[ feyn ] and briefly discussed below .",
    "after symmetry breaking the charged leptons acquire mass through the vev of the @xmath19 doublet scalar @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath33 mass matrix for the neutrinos and heavy fermions @xmath16 in the basis @xmath34 and @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 are each @xmath38 matrices with elements @xmath39 respectively .",
    "the elements of the invariant mass matrix @xmath40 for the heavy leptons @xmath16 can be naturally much larger than the symmetry breaking scales appearing in the off - diagonal blocks , i.e. @xmath41 . in this limit the mass matrix in ( [ seesaw ] ) can be easily block diagonalized by the perturbative seesaw diagonalization method given in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath38 mass matrix for light neutrinos can be viewed as the dirac version of the well known type - i seesaw mechanism and is given as follows @xmath42        note that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are both singlets under @xmath0 . while @xmath5 is even under @xmath4 , @xmath6 is odd and its vev breaks @xmath4 symmetry inducing neutrino mass .",
    "+ turning now to the @xmath23 @xmath43 invariant scalar potential , we can write it as @xmath44    after symmetry breaking one has , in the unitary gauge @xmath45 the minimization conditions are given by @xmath46 the @xmath47 and @xmath48 fields mix with each other and their mass squared matrix in the @xmath49 basis is given by @xmath50 after diagonalization the cp  even neutral mass eigenstates @xmath51 and @xmath6 of [ smass ] are given by @xmath52 where the doublet  singlet mixing angle @xmath53 .",
    "we identify @xmath51 as the 125 gev particle recently discovered at lhc .",
    "let us discuss briefly the role of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 scalars which are singlets under the gauge group , are even under @xmath4 symmetry , but carry @xmath0 charges @xmath9 and @xmath21 respectively . since @xmath32 fields do no acquire vevs , they do not mix with other fields .",
    "however , their masses do receive contribution from the vev of @xmath30 and are given by @xmath54 in the absence of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the lagrangian of the model acquires an enhanced symmetry namely @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a continuous global symmetry which can be interpreted as a generalized global lepton number symmetry .",
    "in the presence of the scalars @xmath7 and @xmath8 one can write following @xmath3 invariant terms in the scalar potential @xmath57 notice that all these terms are @xmath3 invariant but break the global @xmath56 invariance so the remaining symmetry group is just @xmath3 .",
    "note that apart from the above terms , the other terms in scalar potential [ pot ] are invariant under the global u(1 ) . on the other hand the field @xmath8 also couples to the right handed neutrinos through a @xmath3 invariant term @xmath58 again this yukawa coupling is only @xmath3 invariant , breaking the continuous @xmath56 symmetry . owing to the couplings of @xmath8 to the scalar @xmath7 in [ z4invpot ] and to right handed neutrinos as in [ z4invyuk ] , the latter can also couple to @xmath7 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .     mediated by the scalar @xmath8 . ]    after the scalars @xmath5 and @xmath6 acquire vevs , the @xmath4 symmetry breaks spontaneously , implying a small mass for neutrinos .",
    "however , since neither @xmath5 nor @xmath6 carries a @xmath0 charge , one has that @xmath0 remains exact even after spontaneous electroweak breaking .",
    "the unbroken @xmath0 symmetry ensures that the neutrinos do not acquire any majorana mass term , retaining their dirac nature even after spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place .    on the other hand , since the @xmath7 and @xmath8 fields carry the @xmath0 charge , this implies that @xmath7 as well as @xmath8 should not acquire any vev in order to prevent breaking @xmath0 .",
    "this ensures that neutrinos remain dirac and also leads to the possibility that @xmath7 can be a stable particle and thus a potential candidate for dark matter .",
    "we discuss this possibility in the next section .",
    "we now turn briefly to the issue of stability of @xmath7 and its suitability as a dark matter candidate . as mentioned before , to ensure that neutrinos remain dirac particles , the @xmath0 quarticity symmetry should remain exact , so that no scalar carrying a @xmath0 charge should acquire any vev . thus both @xmath8 and @xmath7 which carry @xmath0 charges can potentially be stable as a result of the unbroken @xmath0 symmetry . however , owing to the @xmath0 charge assignments , the @xmath8 field has cubic couplings to both scalars and fermions as noted in eqs .",
    "[ z4invpot ] and [ z4invyuk ] .",
    "these couplings lead to the decay of @xmath8 and thus , despite carrying a @xmath0 charge , @xmath8 is not stable .",
    "on the other hand , due to its @xmath0 charge , all cubic couplings of @xmath7 are forbidden by the unbroken @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this implies that there is no term of the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 stands for other scalar species of the model which is allowed by @xmath0 .",
    "likewise , in the yukawa sector the @xmath0 symmetry also ensures that all terms of the form @xmath61 , @xmath62 denoting a generic fermion , are forbidden .",
    "thus , the residual @xmath0 symmetry responsible for the dirac nature of neutrinos also ensures the stability of the @xmath7 making it a potentially viable dark matter candidate .        although @xmath7 is stable , with no direct tree level coupling to fermions , owing to the symmetry of the model , it couples to right handed neutrinos through exchange of @xmath8 as shown in fig .",
    "moreover , it interacts with other scalars through cubic and quartic terms of the type @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively . in particular , the dark matter interaction with the higgs @xmath51  ( we denote the recently discoverd 125 gev particle as `` higgs '' which in our model will be an admixture of cp  even scalars given in [ masseig ] ) is of special phenomenological interest . if the dark matter mass @xmath65 then the decay @xmath66 , shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ invis_dec ] , is kinematically allowed .",
    "the decay width of @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the higgs dark matter coupling constant .",
    "at lhc , this will be invisible decay of higgs . assuming no addition beyond sm decay apart from the invisible decay , the current lhc data puts a constraint on such invisible decay widths to be no more than @xmath70 of the total decay width @xcite .",
    "this puts a stringent constraint on the higgs dark matter coupling @xmath69 as shown in fig .",
    "[ hdeccon ] .        in our model ,",
    "apart from the dark matter and other standard model higgs decay modes , one has decays to the new scalars @xmath71 . in plotting fig .",
    "[ hdeccon ] , for simplicity , we have assumed that higgs decay to @xmath71 is kinematically forbidden i.e. @xmath72 .",
    "it should be noted that if these decay modes are also allowed , they will also contribute to the invisible decay of higgs as both @xmath71 further decay only to neutrinos .",
    "the higgs dark matter coupling can also be used in order to detect dark matter directly through nuclear recoil in a variety of experiments  @xcite .",
    "the process proceeds through tree ",
    "level higgs exchange , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ invis_dec ] .",
    "thus our @xmath7 wimp dark matter model realizes the so  called `` higgs portal '' dark matter scenario .",
    "the higgs  mediated nucleon ",
    "dark matter cross - section in our model is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the mass of the nucleon and @xmath75 is the dimensionless higgs ",
    "nucleon effective coupling constant .",
    "the null results from the direct detection experiments such as lux @xcite lead to rather stringent constraints on the coupling characterizing the interaction of our wimp scalar dark matter with the the higgs boson .",
    "the experimental sensitivity to our wimp scalar dark matter candidate is illustrated in fig  [ cdirdet ] . in plotting fig   [ cdirdet ]",
    "we have taken the nucleon mass @xmath76 gev and the effective higgs nucleon coupling constant @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "one sees that , in view of the region excluded by the lux experiment , constraints from the invisible higgs decay @xmath78 are relevant only in the low  mass region .        in our model",
    "we have also several terms that lead to dark matter annihilations into two other scalars and fermions , through various diagrams such as illustrated in fig . [ relic ] . by solving numerically the relevant system of boltzmann equations",
    "one can show that the model parameters can be chosen to lead to the correct relic density for dark matter  @xcite   in addition to the direct detection signal discussed here , these terms can also lead to indirect detection signatures associated , for example , to gamma - ray lines from the annihilation channels @xmath79 and @xmath80 channels  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed study of the discovery potential of our wimp candidate in direct as well as indirect detection experiments will be presented elsewhere .    before ending this section",
    "let us briefly mention other features of our model .",
    "first , in our model a conserved @xmath0 charge would also lead to the hypothetical quadruple beta decay process  @xcite .",
    "moreover , since @xmath8 is a real scalar field which couples to right handed neutrinos , its decay to two neutrinos or two antineutrinos may potentially generate a lepton asymmetry in the universe , with potential application to leptogenesis with a conserved @xmath0 lepton number  @xcite .",
    "we intend to present details of these and other features and implications of our model in subsequent works . before closing let us also mention that our model can easily be generalized by including vector  like quarks , so as to accommodate the recent diphoton hint seen by the atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "it would be identified with the scalar @xmath6 , very much along the lines of refs .",
    "we have proposed that dark matter stability reflects the dirac nature of neutrinos .",
    "we illustrated how to realise this proposal within the simplest type i seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation .",
    "the scheme naturally leads to a wimp dark matter candidate which is made stable by the same discrete lepton number @xmath0 symmetry , or quarticity , which makes neutrinos to be dirac particles .",
    "dark matter can be probed by searching for nuclear recoil through the higgs portal mechanism .",
    "the inclusion of the quark sector proceeds rather trivially .",
    "notice that , in making our point that the diracness of neutrinos may be responsible for dark matter stability , we have chosen a simple `` flavor - blind '' scheme based on the use of the simplest @xmath4 symmetry to provide the seesaw mechanism .",
    "the later can be replaced by more complex symmetries , that could also tackle the problem of flavor and leptonic cp violation .",
    "we shall address this issue in a follow up work .",
