    "the observations of halos in light nuclei followed by the skin phenomena in medium and heavy nuclei give new insight into the isospin dynamics of nuclear matter .",
    "firstly predicted in hydrodynamic and collective models@xcite and further approved by microscopic theories@xcite , one of the most interesting findings , related to skin oscillations in stable and unstable neutron - rich nuclei , was a new dipole mode named pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr).@xcite    nowadays , the rapidly increasing number of photon - scattering experiments allows already a systematics of the pdr over different isotopic chains.@xcite    here , we present a theoretical method , based on self - consistent hartree - fock - bogoljubov ( hfb ) description of the nuclear ground state and quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm ) for the excited states.@xcite it is applied for investigations on dipole and other multipole excitations in n=50 , 82 and z=50 nuclei , particularly exploring their connection to the thickness of the nuclear skin . as a link to nuclear many - body theory a density functional theory ( dft ) is applied to express the interaction part in the energy density functional in terms of wood - saxon potentials .",
    "the model hamiltonian resembles in structure the traditional qpm model @xcite but in detail differs in the physical content in important aspects as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this sense , the approach is able to describe the nuclear ground state properties like binding energies , neutron and proton root mean square radii and the difference between them defining the nuclear skin , and separation energies.@xcite calculations of ground state neutron and proton densities for z=50 and n=50 , 82 nuclei are shown in refs . @xcite .",
    "of special importance for these investigations are the nuclear surface regions , where the formation of a skin takes place .",
    "a common observation found in the investigated isotopic and isotonic chains of nuclei is that the thickness of the neutron skin is related to the neutron - to - proton ratio n / z .",
    "the nuclear excitations are expressed in terms of quasiparticle - random - phase- approximation ( qrpa ) phonons : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a single - particle proton or neutron state ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are time - forward and time - backward operators , coupling two - quasiparticle creation or annihilation operators to a total angular momentum @xmath5 with projection @xmath6 by means of the clebsch - gordan coefficients @xmath7 .",

    "the total pdr strength is found to be closely related to the neutron skin thickness .",
    "qrpa results for sn isotopes are presented in fig .",
    "the transition of the neutron pdr to a proton pdr manifests itself via the proton and neutron transition densities as well .",
    "thus , in @xmath14sn the proton oscillations dominate at the nuclear surface due to the formation of a proton skin ( see in ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . in comparison",
    ", the presence of a neutron skin explains the neutron oscillations at the surface of tin nuclei with a@xmath15106 as it is demonstrated for @xmath16sn in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( left panel ) .    furthermore , in theoretical investigations of 2@xmath17 excitations in sn isotopic chain , we find a strength clustering at low - energies of quadrupole states with predominantly neutron structure .",
    "they strongly resemble by spectroscopic features the known pdr excitations in terms of spectral distributions , electric response functions and transition densities .",
    "these states we relate to pygmy quadrupole resonance ( pqr).@xcite the connection of the pqr with neutron ( proton ) skin oscillations is demonstrated in analysis of transition densities ( see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( right panel ) ) . similarly to the pdr , a transition from a neutron pqr to a proton pqr in @xmath18sn is observed for the mass region where the neutron skin reverses into a proton skin .",
    "an important question to clarify is the fine structure of the observed low - energy dipole strength . for this purpose ,",
    "qpm calculations of low - energy e1 and spin - flip m1 excitations are made , in a configuration space including up to three - phonon components , in @xmath0ba nucleus .",
    "the results are compared to experimental data obtained from polarized photon beams.@xcite the experimental observations and their theoretical interpretation show unambiguously the predominantly electric character of the observed low - energy dipole strength ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "namely , only the electric dipole strength should be related to pdr mode ( for more details see in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the systematic investigations in isotopic and isotonic chains reveal a connection between pdr and pqr strengths and the n / z ratio defining the size of the neutron or proton skin .",
    "this connection manifests itself as well via the independence of the pdr and pqr modes of the type of nucleon excess .    in n=82 nuclei",
    "the low - energy dipole strength is mostly due to electric excitations . even though , in order to determine the pure pdr strength associated with a nuclear skin , the magnetic contribution must be identified and subtracted ."
