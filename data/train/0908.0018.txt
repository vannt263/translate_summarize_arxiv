    "this hyper - starburst is harbored by a large , 5kpc size , overall warm and highly excited molecular gas reservoir that hosts @xmath88  of molecular hydrogen and 1.1@xmath610@xmath89  of atomic carbon .",
    "there are additional lines of evidence that suggest that @xmath60 as high as 1000yr@xmath13kpc@xmath21 on kpc scales ( as observed in j1148 + 5251 ) are not unreasonable .",
    "recent investigations of the ( in the nearby universe linear ) hcn - fir luminosity correlation at high @xmath0 ( including j1148 + 5251 ) show tentative evidence for an excess in @xmath17 relative to the observed @xmath90 toward the highest @xmath17 systems ( both with and without agn ; carilli et al .",
    "@xcite ; gao et al .",
    "@xcite ; riechers et al.@xcite ) .",
    "such an excess can be explained by higher median gas densities ( comparable to the critical density of hcn @xmath31=1@xmath480 ) in the most fir - luminous galaxies ( krumholz & thompson @xcite ; narayanan et al .  @xcite ) .",
    "even when assuming a constant efficiency of turning a unit mass of molecular gas into stars among all galaxies , this would imply a higher sfr per unit area for the most fir - luminous systems .",
    "the ( molecular ) gas surface density in j1148 + 5251 consistently reaches high peak values of up to @xmath91kpc@xmath21 . in figure",
    "[ f6 ] , the @xmath92 of j1148 + 5251 , other @xmath93 quasar host galaxies ( carilli et al .",
    "@xcite ; riechers et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , and a sample of nearby lirgs and ulirgs ( wilson et al .",
    "@xcite ) is shown as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "for comparison , a lower limit for @xmath64 smgs is shown ( tacconi et al.@xcite ) .",
    "wilson et al .  ( @xcite ) suggested that there may be a trend of increasing @xmath94 with @xmath17 .",
    "this would be consistent with a higher density of gas clouds toward more intensely star - forming galaxies .",
    "however , their sample of nearby galaxies spans only about an order of magnitude in @xmath17 . including the more fir - luminous high-@xmath0 systems , this trend gets substantially weaker .",
    "in fact , the high-@xmath0 systems appear to occupy a similar range in @xmath94 as the nearby ulirgs , and the relation appears to saturate close to the typical gas surface densities of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "this would imply that , in the most fir - luminous systems , the entire , kiloparsec - scale regions with the highest @xmath95 have gas surface densities close to those in gmcs .",
    "one limitation of this conclusion is that the nearby galaxies were studied at a factor 1.8 higher linear ( physical ) resolution than the @xmath93 systems .",
    "this , however , is not sufficient to explain the weakening of the trend . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath0=4.4 quasar bri1335 - 0417 with the highest @xmath94 ( riechers et al.@xcite ) was studied at only 20% lower resolution than the nearby sample average . even assuming conservatively that @xmath92 is by @xmath550% higher in this source ( according to the difference in beam area ) ,",
    "it is still consistent with that in the nuclei of the nearby ulirg arp220 ( downes & solomon @xcite ) .",
    "this would be consistent with a picture in which the molecular ism in ulirgs and even more fir - luminous systems is dominantly in a rather dense , relatively continuous phase ( rather than in individual , moderately dense molecular clouds ) , exhibiting optically thick emission . while the measured ( peak ) gas surface densities are comparable , the gas is spread out over larger areas in the high-@xmath0 quasar host galaxies relative to the ( dense ) nuclei of nearby ulirgs , consistent with the higher total gas masses and sfrs , and higher median gas densities ( integrated over the whole galaxies ) .",
    "overall , this may suggest that a tighter correlation would be found if @xmath94 is compared to @xmath63 instead of the integrated @xmath17 ( as a proxy of sfr ) .      assuming that the massive amounts of molecular material available on 5kpc scales in j1148 + 5251 are converted into stars at an efficiency of 5%10% as in gmc cores ( e.g. , myers et al .",
    "@xcite ; scoville et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the sfr corresponds to a gas depletion timescale of only ( 0.71.4 ) @xmath6 10@xmath16yr .",
    "this is about one - third of the value found for bri1335 - 0417 ( riechers et al .",
    "@xcite ) , suggesting a rapid buildup of the stellar component in both galaxies .",
    "still , this gas depletion timescale is a few times larger than the dynamical and free - fall times of both the 0.75kpc radius region traced by , and the full 5kpc size molecular reservoir . in this regard , the ongoing star formation",
    "may still be considered slow .",
    "the  dynamical mass estimate suggests that j1148 + 5251 hosts a total mass of @xmath51.5 @xmath6 10@xmath20  within a @xmath50.75kpc radius region .",
    "a present day , massive elliptical galaxy with a black hole mass comparable to j1148 + 5251 and a velocity dispersion of 300  hosts a total mass of @xmath558 @xmath6 10@xmath20  within a central region of the same size ( and a total stellar mass of @xmath52 @xmath6 10@xmath96  distributed over its entire spheroid ; e.g. , hring & rix @xcite ) . even assuming that the whole amount of molecular material in j1148 + 5251 were to eventually contribute to the assembly of the stellar spheroid within this small central region leaves a factor of a few difference between the central mass budgets of the @xmath0=6.42 quasar and a @xmath0=0 massive elliptical galaxy .",
    "this suggests that j1148 + 5251 has to accrete additional material by @xmath0=0 ( e.g. , through subsequent mergers ) to grow a spheroid mass comparable to its ( likely ) present - day counterparts .    on the other hand ,",
    "the widths of the  and  lines are the same within the uncertainties , while the sizes of the co and emitting regions appear to be different by a factor of @xmath53 .",
    "thus , [ cii ] traces a smaller dynamical mass than co , corresponding to a shallower potential well .",
    "this difference may indicate that the gas in j1148 + 5251 has not yet fully coalesced , possibly due to an ongoing merger .",
    "this would be consistent with the high star formation efficiency found in the central region of this galaxy ( walter et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the comparatively high fraction of dense gas ( riechers et al .  @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that the highly excited , several kpc scale size gas reservoirs in dust- and gas - rich high-@xmath0 quasar host galaxies are dominantly heated by the large - scale starbursts that they maintain , consistent with cosmological simulations of merger - driven @xmath97 quasar formation ( li et al .",
    "@xcite ; narayanan et al.@xcite ) .",
    "these starbursts reach surface densities as predicted by eddington - limited star formation over kpc scales , accompanied ( and probably supported ) by ongoing major , ` wet ' merger activity in some cases .",
