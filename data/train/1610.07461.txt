    "we have studied the response of a dissipative hybrid qubit - cavity system to the applied strong driving field , having in mind the future possible realization of quantum operations in superconducting quantum metamaterials .",
    "we demonstrated that for the case studied the many - body effects ( or , equally , the entanglement between the qubit and photon excitations ) are important and that the system can not be treated by means of a mean - field approximation .",
    "this is shown from a comparison of analytical steady state solution of the standard maxwell - bloch equations and numerical simulations based on lindblad equation on the many - body density matrix .",
    "speaking more concretely , we have shown that mean - field approach , where the density matrix of the system can be represented via direct product of isolated qubit and photon ones @xmath72 , provides a good steady state solution up to certain threshold @xmath8 but at @xmath1 the strong discrepancy from the many - body result is observed .",
    "it is related with a growing value of quantum correlations between fluctuations of qubit and photons fields which start to play a significant role in behavior of the system .",
    "we show in our analysis that at large enough coupling energy between cavity and qubit modes the solution of maxwell - bloch equations reveals an artifact being a hysteresis in number of photons as function of the driving amplitude in vicinity of the threshold @xmath8 .",
    "such a hysteresis has not been observed in the full density matrix solution .",
    "also we have studied an effect of the non - adiabatic switching of the driving and show that there is a difference between mean - field and the density matrix solutions even for the drivings weaker than the steady state threshold @xmath8 .",
    "our findings demonstrate quantitative limitations of standard mean - field description and show the crossover between the classical and many - body quantum regimes . in the classical regime ,",
    "the qubit virtually acts as a linear ( gaussian ) degree of freedom ; this regime can not reveal a difference between the quantum and linear - optical metamaterials .",
    "when the two - level nature of the qubit plays an essential role , its entanglement with the cavity mode is also large and should be accounted .",
    "we also point out that the effect of correlations is revealed while the number of photons in the cavity mode is not small and one could naively expect that the cavity operates in a classical regime . in our solutions",
    "we have used parameters relevant for contemporary metamaterials involving highly anharmonic flux qubits , and we expect that the obtained results will find an application in realization of quantum gates in superconducting quantum circuits and metamaterials .",
