    "solitary waves or solitons are a consequence of nonlinear dynamics .",
    "a classic text - book example of soliton appears in the following one - dimensional nonlinear free schrdinger equation in dimensionless units @xmath2 the solitons of this equation are localized solution due to the attractive nonlinear interaction @xmath3 with wave function at time @xmath4 and position @xmath5 : @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the energy @xcite .",
    "solitons have been noted in optics @xcite , high - energy physics and water waves @xcite , and more recently in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite . the schrdinger equation with a nonlinear interaction @xmath8 does not sustain a localized solitonic solution in three dimensions .",
    "however , a radially trapped and axially free version of this equation in three dimensions does sustain such a bright solitonic solution @xcite which has been observed experimentally @xcite . here",
    "we study the dynamics of these bright solitons .",
    "we also suggest that such solitons can be generated in an axially rotating nonzero angular momentum state , which are called bright vortex solitons and can be observed in bec .",
    "a number of bright solitons constituting a soliton train was observed in an experiment by strecker _",
    "@xcite , where they turned a repulsive bec of @xmath9li atoms attractive by manipulating the background magnetic field near a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "it was found @xcite that solitons in such a train usually stay apart .",
    "also , often a soliton was found to be missing from a train @xcite .",
    "there have been theoretical attempts @xcite to simulate essentials of these experiments @xcite .",
    "we use the explicit numerical solution of the axially - symmetric mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite to study the dynamics of bright solitons in a soliton train @xcite .",
    "attractive bec s may not form vortices in a thermodynamically stable state . however , due to the conservation of angular momentum , a vortex soliton train could be generated by suddenly changing the inter - atomic interaction in an axially - symmetric rotating vortex condensate from repulsive to attractive near a feshbach resonance @xcite in the same fashion as in the experiment by strecker _",
    "@xcite for a non - rotating bec .",
    "alternatively , a single vortex soliton could be prepared and studied in the laboratory by forming a vortex in a small repulsive condensate and then making the interaction attractive via a feshbach resonance and subsequently reducing the axial trap slowly .",
    "in a quantized vortex state @xcite , with each atom having angular momentum @xmath10 along the axial @xmath5 axis , the axially - symmetric wave function can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the azimuthal angle and @xmath13 the radial direction .",
    "the dynamics of the bec in an axially - symmetric trap can be described by the following gp equation @xcite @xmath14\\varphi ( { r , y};t)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the length , time , and wave function are expressed in units of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17^{-1}$ ] , respectively . here",
    "radial and axial trap frequencies are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , @xmath20 is the atomic mass , @xmath21 is the harmonic oscillator length , and @xmath22 the nonlinearity with @xmath23 the interatomic scattering length . for solitonic states",

    "for @xmath32 , the system becomes too attractive and collapses and no stable soliton could be generated .",
    "the actual value of @xmath30 is a function of the trap parameter @xmath33 . for the spherically symmetric case @xmath34 , and @xmath35 @xcite . numerically solving the gp equation ( [ d1 ] ) for @xmath36 , we find that the critical @xmath24 for collapse of a single soliton is @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 . for @xmath38 @xmath37",
