    "lattice gauge field theory brings the representation theory of an underlying manifold and its quantum invariants into the same setting .",
    "consider the case of a cylinder over a compact , oriented surface with boundary .",
    "a lattice model of the surface determines an algebra of gauge invariant fields ( i.e. observables ) . in the classical case , based on a connected , simply connected lie group @xmath0 , observables are the characters of the fundamental group of the lattice represented in @xmath0 .",
    "wilson loops can be understood as traces of conjugacy classes in the fundamental group of the lattice .",
    "for the theory based on a drinfeld - jimbo deformation of a simple lie algebra @xmath1 , the observables are a deformation quantization of the @xmath0-characters of the surface with respect to the standard poisson structure @xcite . in the case of @xmath2",
    "this , together with the classical isomorphism @xcite , allowed us to prove that the algebra of observables is the kauffman bracket skein algebra of the surface , completed as an algebra over formal power series .",
    "in this paper we return to an analytic setting in which the deformation parameter is any complex number other than a root of unity . the analogous theorem relating observables and the kauffman bracket skein algebra is again true . the proof is based on the combinatorial equivalence between the temperley - lieb algebra and the quantized invariant theory of @xmath3 ; it does not explicitly use the relationship with surface characters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ kauffman ] recalls definitions and associated formulas of the kauffman bracket skein algebra .",
    "section [ reps ] summarizes , for the generic parameter , the construction of a quasi - triangular matrix model of quantum @xmath3 .",
    "section [ lgft ] outlines basic definitions and constructions of lattice gauge field theory .",
    "section [ temperley ] describes the correspondence between skeins and intertwiners in the verlinde algebra for quantum @xmath3 .",
    "finally , section [ observable ] contains a proof of the main theorem .",
    "let @xmath4 be a complex number that is neither @xmath5 nor a root of unity .",
    "suppose that @xmath6 is a compact , oriented surface with boundary and @xmath7 is a closed interval .",
    "denote by @xmath8 the set of isotopy classes of framed links in @xmath9 , including the empty link .",
    "let @xmath10 be the vector space with basis @xmath8 .",
    "define @xmath11 to be the subspace of @xmath10 spanned by all expressions of the form @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where the framed links in each expression are identical outside the balls pictured in the diagrams .",
    "the kauffman bracket skein algebra @xmath14 is the quotient @xmath15 .",
    "multiplication is given by laying one link over the other .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath16 and @xmath17 are in @xmath8 , isotop them so that @xmath16 lies in @xmath18 , and @xmath17 in @xmath19 $ ] . then @xmath20 is the union of these two links in @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "extend linearly to a product on @xmath10 . since @xmath11 is an ideal",
    ", the product descends , making the skein module into a skein algebra .",
    "since the algebra structure depends on the specific product structure of @xmath9 , rather than its topological type , we use the notation @xmath22 .",
    "we use the standard convention of modeling a skein in @xmath22 on a framed , admissibly colored , trivalent graph .",
    "an admissible coloring is an assignment of a nonnegative integer to each edge so that the colors at each vertex form admissible triples .",
    "a triple @xmath23 is admissible if @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is even .",
    "the corresponding skein in @xmath22 is obtained by replacing each edge labeled with the letter @xmath28 by the @xmath28-th jones  wenzl idempotent ( see @xcite , or @xcite ) , and replacing trivalent vertices with kauffman triads ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  14.7 ) ) . if @xmath29 is a trivalent spine of @xmath6 then the set of skeins carried by admissible colorings of @xmath29 forms a basis @xmath30 for @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath6 is an annulus , @xmath30 consists of skeins obtained by labeling the core with a jones  wenzl idempotent .",
    "one may think of the core as a `` trivalent '' spine with one vertex , whose admissible labels are @xmath31 .",
    "the space @xmath22 also has a basis @xmath32 consisting of all links with simple diagrams on @xmath6 , i.e.  with no crossings and no trivial components .",
    "the details of the following can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath33 be the unital hopf algebra on @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , with relations : @xmath38 let @xmath39 denote the irreducible @xmath40-dimensional representation of @xmath33 .",
    "fixing an ordered basis for @xmath39 we define linear functionals @xmath41 to be the coefficient in the @xmath42-th row and @xmath43-th column in the representation @xmath39 . the @xmath44 form a basis for the stable subalgebra @xmath45 of the hopf algebra dual @xmath46 .",
    "( here @xmath47 . )",
    "define @xmath48 and give it the product topology .",
    "a typical element of @xmath49 is a sequence of arbitrarily chosen matrices in which the @xmath42-th term is an @xmath50 matrix .",
    "let @xmath51 be the homomorphism corresponding to the representation @xmath39 .",
    "the homomorphism @xmath52 given by @xmath53 , is injective and its image is dense in @xmath49 ( see @xcite ) . the algebra @xmath49 is the completion of @xmath33 by equivalence classes of cauchy sequences in the weak topology from @xmath45 .",
    "it has the structure of a topological ribbon hopf algebra .",
    "the projection of @xmath49 onto its @xmath40-st factor is an irreducible representation of @xmath49 , also denoted by @xmath39 . composing @xmath44 with this projection yields a function on @xmath49 , also called @xmath44 .",

    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath55 be an oriented , ciliated graph ; i.e.  the edges are oriented and the vertices carry a linear ordering of the adjacent edges .",
    "one can think of this as instructions for building a strip and disk model of an oriented surface @xmath6 having @xmath55 as a strong deformation retract .",
    "vertices correspond to the disks , edges to strips , and the ciliation determines how to glue the strips to the disks . the surface @xmath6 is called the envelope of @xmath55 .",

    "the action is : @xmath64 for any @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the dual vector space to @xmath62 .",
    "when @xmath49 acts on the right , denote the dual by @xmath68 with @xmath69    there is an alternate description of observables in terms of `` colorings '' of the lattice . assigning a representation @xmath70 to each positively oriented edge @xmath71 of the lattice",

    "use the representation @xmath70 for the edges @xmath71 starting at a vertex and the dual @xmath73 for the edges terminating there . the resulting representation at a vertex @xmath74 is denoted by @xmath75 .",

    "exists a non - zero dual element invariant under the right action of @xmath49 .",
    "the tensor product of these invariants over all vertices defines an observable .",

    "clearly @xmath94 . since @xmath95",
    "unless @xmath96 , @xmath92 is annihilated by all observables constructed from colorings different than @xmath97 .    from this",
    "we conclude that any set of observables constructed from distinct colorings is independent .",

    "there is a map @xmath98 that assigns to each framed link a wilson operator .",
