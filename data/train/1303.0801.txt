    "since the experimental discovery of graphene ,  @xcite extensive attention  @xcite has been given to this field due to graphene s unique band structure and properties .",
    "it has been shown in many studies that pristine graphene is a zero - gap semiconductor and has a linear dispersion relationship nearby the dirac points ,  @xcite which makes electrons behave as relativistic dirac particles .",
    "moreover , it has been experimentally verified that graphene has a remarkably high electron mobility at room temperature , with reported values in excess of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite high electron mobility makes graphene an excellent conductor . owing to its exceptional electrical  @xcite and thermal  @xcite transport properties",
    ", graphene has been an important two - dimensional material for exploring condensed matter physical phenomena  @xcite and is expected to be very useful in the next generation of electronic devices .",
    "@xcite    before applications of graphene can be realized in electronic devices , control over the electron transport in graphene needs to be improved .",
    "inspired by the role of defects , vacancies , and dopants in the semiconductor industry , many researchers have studied the effects related to disorder in graphene , which could be due to adsorbed atoms ( or molecules ) , charged impurities , vacancies or other topological defects .",
    "@xcite    point defects  @xcite , and magnetic behavior near point defects ,  @xcite in graphene have been extensively studied in many papers .",
    "given carbon s lack of @xmath1 or @xmath2 electrons , magnetism in graphene seems unlikely .",
    "magnetic behavior near point defects has been of increasing interest , and has attracted extensive attention .",
    "@xcite in addition , because of universality of grain boundary in graphene , it has been investigated and is predicted to have distinct electronic ,  @xcitemagnetic ,  @xcite chemical  @xcite and mechanical  @xcite properties that strongly depend on the atomic arrangement .",
    "furthermore , it has also been found that adsorbed atoms ( or molecules ) greatly affect the properties of graphene , such as lithium , aluminum , iron , and gold adatoms in graphene .",
    "@xcite the previous researches in this subject illustrate that the properties of graphene can be controlled by defects , grain boundaries , or adsorbed atoms .",
    "recently , a peculiar topological line defect in graphene was reported experimentally by lahiri et al .",
    "@xcite this topological line defect is created by alternating the stone - thrower - wales defect  @xcite and divacancies , leading to a pattern of repeating paired pentagons and octagons , as shown in fig .",
    "importantly , it is found in this experiment that this line defect has metallic characteristics .",
    "subsequently , gunlycke and white  @xcite proposed a valley filter based on scattering off this line defect in graphene . using a tight - binding model calculation , metallic characteristics and fabry - perot oscillation phenomena",
    "have been observed in graphene line defects by bahamon et al .",
    "@xcite by using first - principles calculations , researchers from two different groups have calculated the electronic structure of graphene with topological line defects , and predicted a possible ferromagnetic ordering in line defects .",
    "@xcite in addition , a zigzag graphene nanoribbon edge reconstruction with stone - wales defects has also been studied recently by rodrigues et al .",
    "@xcite    note that this line defect manifests a metallic behavior in most of reported results .",
    "however , because the states of line defect and the bulk states are mixed together in energy , it is difficult to distinguish each other in experiment . in recent ,",
    "it is reported by a lot of research groups that a energy gap can be generated by various method , e.g. adatoms or substrate .",
    "these studies inspire us that the line defect in graphene can be observed directly if the state of line defect falls into the energy gap , and even some promising electronic devices can be fabricated .",
    "motivated by the idea of finding a potential application of line defect , we therefore extend the investigation of line defects in graphene with sublattice symmetry breaking potentials .",
    "this paper describes how some novel states are induced in the bulk gap by line defects and that these states can be tuned continuously by changing the gate voltage embedded below the line defect .",
    "based on these results , a quantum channel is proposed at the end of this paper .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii , the tight - binding hamiltonian of graphene with a line defect is introduced .",
    "section iii gives numerical results along with some discussions .",
    "finally , a brief summary is presented in sec .",
    "in the tight binding approximation with nearest neighbor hopping energy @xmath3 , a single layer of graphene can be described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the electron annihilation ( creation ) operator on the site @xmath7 , and @xmath8 sums only over the nearest neighbor sites .    for this hamiltonian , we consider a general situation where the bulk lattice can be subject to a staggered sublattice potential : @xmath9 for lattice sites ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 for lattice ( @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 for the line defect sites ( red ) , sketched in fig.1 . for simplicity , in the following description of this paper , the sublattice a is introduced to represent the lattice sites ( @xmath10 ) ;",
    "the sublattice b is used to represent the lattice sites ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "note that a ( or b ) sublattice sites can possess either positive or negative staggered potentials by changing the sign of the parameter @xmath14 . due to rearranging of carbon atoms near the line defect",
    ", the bond distances rearrange from 1.38 to 1.44 @xmath15 , which therefore induces a variation less than @xmath16 in the hopping term @xmath3 . as described in",
    "almost all reported results ,  @xcite the hopping term @xmath3 can be considered nearly unaffected with respect to a defect - free graphene ( for which @xmath17 ) . to test the results from our model",
    ", we calculate the energy band for a nanoribbon with the extended defect shown in fig .",
    "2 . the calculated results arising from the band in fig .",
    "2(a ) show a good match with results in another paper reported by bahamon et al .",
    "@xcite    it is worth noting that a staggered potential has had extensive theoretical investigation in many systems . in 1991 , haldane  @xcite introduced this potential in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice and proposed the existence of quantum hall effect in the absence of an external magnetic field . following the haldane model above",
    ", kane and mele  @xcite studied a graphene model with a staggered potential between different sublattices and showed that it could be possible to observe quantum spin hall effect due to the intrinsic spin - orbital coupling in graphene .",
    "although a staggered potential can not give rise to topological quantum states , it makes easier to observe them and is helpful to find their physical origins .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that a quantum phase transition can be induced by tuning the staggered potential .",
    "therefore , in theory , a staggered potential is significant in finding some fascinating quantum phenomenon and quantum phase transitions , and has been also discussed in other systems .",
    "@xcite    in experiment , staggered potentials at different sublattice sites could be introduced in graphene by an asymmetric interaction with a substrate .",
    "for example , when a graphene sheet is put on top of a lattice - matched hexagonal boron nitride substrate , a staggered potential can be observed due to the inequivalence of the two carbon sites , one of which is on top of a boron atom and the other centers above a boron - nitride ring .",
    "@xcite the resulting staggered potential is also natural for silicene  @xcite because silicene has a two - dimensional low - buckled honeycomb structure , which leads to a definitely asymmetric interactions between the different sublattice sites and the substrate . for the system of graphene with a line defect",
    ", a staggered potential may exist due to the two different adsorption geometries , namely the fcc and hcp , when stacking graphene on top of ni(111 ) .",
    "@xcite besides , different adatoms or deformations on different sublattices of graphene can also lead to a staggered potential experimentally . in brief ,",
    "due to a promising realization of a staggered potential experimentally , the staggered potential for graphene considered in our model is reasonable .",

    "2 . first ,",
    "to easily capture the changes in the band structure induced by a staggered potential , the band spectrum with a line defect is firstly plotted with parameter @xmath24 in fig .",
    "it can be found that two additional states ( red lines ) are included in contrast to the band structure of pristine graphene .",

    "importantly , when @xmath25 for the configuration 1 , an extra state due to the line defect can be seen in the gap and fills approximately half of the band gap .",
    "however , this special state in the band gap due to the line defect disappears completely when we turn to the band spectrum of the configuration 2 with @xmath26 as shown in fig .",

    "2(d ) is stable and robust when changing the width of ribbon , the onsite energy of ribbon s edges , and the position of line defect within the ribbon .",
    "@xcite consequently , using the line defect in graphene shown in fig .",
    "1 , it may be possible to construct a one - dimensional quantum channel to connect various quantum devices . the technology for fabricating and controlling graphene based electronic device is becoming excellent with the boom of graphene research .",

    "( 1 ) for the configuration 1 or 2 with @xmath24 in fig .",
    "9(a ) , an asymmetrical conductance plateau is observed near the dirac point , which indicates that the particle - hole symmetry is broken due to the existence of line defect . because there is no band gap at this case ,",
    "the conductance would change but always keeps no less than @xmath75 for the different onsite energies of the line defect , @xmath23 .",
    "( 2 ) for the configuration 1 with @xmath25 , the conductance in fig .",
    "9(b ) jumps from zero to a @xmath76 quantum plateau for @xmath77 while for @xmath78 it falls from a @xmath76 quantum plateau to zero when increasing the fermi energy from @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "( 3 ) in all plots shown in fig .",
    "9 , the conductance curves keep almost unchanged for @xmath79 .",
    "however , for @xmath78 , the conductance always shows great differences from that at the other cases with @xmath80 .",
    "this is because , in this case , the line - defect state is greatly affected by such large onsite energy of the line defect and thus far away from the original position .",
    "( 4 ) specially , it is observed in figs .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) that the conductance exhibits either a quantum plateau or zero for the energy inside the band gap .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "4(d ) , the @xmath76 quantum plateau has almost no variation when @xmath81 .",
    "however , the conductance falls to zero for a large onsite energy of the line defect , @xmath78 , because here the line - defect state is far from the gap and completely merges into the bulk band .",
    "note that all of the observations about the conductance in fig .",
    "9 are consistent with the characteristics of the band spectra discussed above in fig . 7 and fig .",
    "8 . in summary",
    ", the graphene with a line defect can exhibit an insulator or a metal with a quantum conductance @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , a quantum channel can be constructed using the line defect and importantly it can be turned on or off easily by changing the onsite energy of the line defect .    .",
    "all conductances are calculated for the configuration 2 with @xmath25 , @xmath30 , and @xmath83 . ]    in general , vacancies or point defects can affect the transport of a line defect greatly .",
    "@xcite thus , we consider the influence of vacancy on the transport properties of a line defect and the results are shown in fig .",
    ", we assume that a vacancy is generated due to two - atom missing from the line defect , which lie at the sites in the same supercell ( such as the two red sites in the red rectangle in fig.1 ) .",
    "meanwhile , in order to minimize the total energy , the carbon atom s electrons , which lie at the up and down carbon atoms sites nearby the missing atoms , can now hop directly with strength @xmath3 . as shown in fig .",
    "10(a ) , although the conductance has a dip to zero for fermi energies near the bottom of the conductance band , the quantum conductance plateau is robust for fermi energies near the top of the valence band .",
    "this conclusion is general for all curves when @xmath80 .",
    "additionally , when considering two vacancies in a line defect , a completely different picture is presented in fig .",
    "10(b ) . here",
    ", the size of the central region is chosen to be @xmath30 and @xmath83 , and two vacancies of the line defect lie at both ends of the line defect in the central region , ( the distance of two vacancies is therefore denoted by @xmath84 with @xmath85 ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "10(b ) , the quantum conductance plateau disappears and is replaced by the conductance oscillations .",
    "that is because a standing wave is formed due to reflections by the two vacancies .",
    "therefore , the oscillations shown in this energy range are simply the fabry - perot interference effect due to the broken translational symmetry introduced by the vacancies in the line defect .  @xcite",
    "with considering a broken bulk inversion symmetry due to a staggered potential , we study the graphene with a line defect and find that distinctive band spectra could be obtained for different configurations which can be attributed to different distributions of a staggered potential",
    ". in particular , a gapless state exists for a given configuration which holds a mirror symmetry with respect to the line defect .",
    "further calculations show that this special band structure is independent of the width of ribbon , the onsite energy of ribbon s edges , and the location of line defect within the ribbon . through analyzing the distribution of wave function of the gapless state",
    ", it is found that this gapless state should be attributed to the line defect .",
    "in addition , the gapless state is robust against a weak perturbations of the onsite energy of the line defect , e.g. , keeps always gapless when @xmath81 [ shown in fig .",
    "these exotic characteristics of line defects illustrate that a quantum channel could be fabricated using the line defect .",
    "in particular , the turning on or off of this quantum channel can be realized by a gate voltage embedded below the line defect .",
    "the line defect could then be used to connect different quantum devices and serve as a quantum channel to transport quantum signals between devices .",
    "all the results in this study support the idea that the line defect is a useful structure for the implementation of a quantum channel in the field of microelectronics .",

    "<S> using a tight binding model , we study a line defect in graphene where a bulk energy gap is opened by sublattice symmetry breaking . it is found that sublattice symmetry breaking may induce many configurations that correspond to different band spectra . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a gapless state is observed for a configuration which hold a mirror symmetry with respect to the line defect . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this gapless state originates from the line defect and is independent of the width of the graphene ribbon , the location of the line defect , and the potentials in the edges of ribbon . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the gapless state can be controlled by the gate voltage embedded below the line defect . </S>",
    "<S> finally , this result is supported with conductance calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this study shows how a quantum channel could be constructed using a line defect and how the quantum channel can be controlled by tuning the gate voltage embedded below the line defect . </S>"
