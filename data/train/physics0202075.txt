    "recently , there has been considerable interest in the finding of long range correlations in genomic dna sequences @xcite .",
    "a dna sequence is a chain of sites , each occupied by either a purine ( adenine and guanine ) or a pyrimidine ( cytocyine and thymine ) group . for mathematical modeling , the dna sequence might be considered as a string of symbols ( g , a , t and c ) whose correlation structure can be characterized completely by all possible base - base correlation functions or their corresponding power spectra .",
    "different techniques including mutual information functions and power spectra analyses @xcite , auto correlation @xcite , dna walk representation @xcite , wavelet analysis @xcite and zipf analysis @xcite were used for statistical analyses of dna sequences . but",
    "despite the effort spent , it is still an open question whether the long range correlation properties are different for protein coding ( exonic ) and non coding ( intronic , intergenemic ) sequences @xcite .",
    "one more fundamental ground , there is still continuing debate as to whether the reported long range correlations really mean a lack of independence at long distances or simply reflect the patchiness ( bias in nucleotide composition ) of dna sequences .",
    "there have been attempts to eliminate local patchiness using methods such as min - max @xcite , detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) @xcite and wavelet analysis @xcite . in spite of its success in modeling the long range correlations observed in dna sequences , as indicated by the power law increase in the variance and the inverse power law spectrum @xcite ,",
    "the problem of the correct statistical interpretation of dna walk is still unresolved and is attracting the attention of an increasing number of investigators .",
    "since approaches based on different models predict different correlation structure , there is no unique measure of the degree of correlation in dna sequences .",
    "therefore , it is very important to investigate the correlations and extract the power law exponent @xmath4 rather in a model independent way so that the interpretation of the data including the theoretical analysis becomes more meaningful .",
    "there is another confusion related to this study is the absence of a clear definition of the term `` long range '' .",
    "clearly , what is considered to be long is relative to what is considered to be short . to over come some of these problems ,",
    "recently we have suggested a new method @xcite to measure the degree of correlations using the variance analysis of the density distribution of a single or a group of nucleotides .",
    "we have also suggested a way to find out an approximate length scale above which all dna sequences show strong long range correlations irrespective of their intron contents while below this , the correlation is relatively weak .",
    "further , the density distribution which is nearly gaussian at short distances shows significant deviations from the gaussian statistics at large distances . in this paper",
    ", we present the details of the analyses and also extract the correlation parameter @xmath4 for several intron containing and intronless sequences .",
    "in the present method , we build the frequency spectrum of a single or a group of nucleotides by dividing the dna sequence into many equal intervals of length @xmath5 .",
    "for example , to build a purine spectrum , we compute n=_i = l_0^l_0+l u_i where @xmath6=1 if the site is occupied by a g or a and @xmath6=0 otherwise .",
    "ideally , one can divide the entire dna sequence of length @xmath7 into @xmath8 equal intervals of size @xmath5 @xmath9 .",
    "the purine or ga spectrum can be built by computing @xmath10 from all the intervals .",
    "alternatively , @xmath10 can be computed in any segment between @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the spectrum ( @xmath10 distribution or @xmath13 ) is built by varying the starting position @xmath11 from 1 , 2 , 3 etc upto @xmath14 so as to cover the whole sequence . can be zero due to the non occurence of a given nucleotide .",
    "in such cases , the density spectrum can be built either including or excluding zero@xmath15 channel . in this analysis",
    ", we include zero@xmath15 channel also so that the complementarity is satisfied which is unlike the case when the zero@xmath15 channel is excluded .",
    "see appendix b for details ] we adopt this second procedure for better statistics .",
    "finally , the standard deviation ( sd ) of this @xmath13 distribution can be obtained from @xmath16 which in general will depend on the interval or the window size @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to the standard deviation @xmath17 , we also compute the factorial moments @xmath18 s of @xmath13 .",
    "the normalized factorial moments of order q are written as f_q= where f_q=_n = q^ p_n n(n-1) ..... (n - q+1 ) = _ n = q ^ p_n as will be shown later , the factorial moment has the distinct advantage over the normal moments in identifying the genomic sequence from the random one .",
    "it may be mentioned here that for random poisson distribution , the factorial moments for all q s become unity i.e. for p_n= the above factor for @xmath19 becomes f_q=_n = q^ = _ n = q^ = _",
    "m=0^ = a^q_m=0^ = a^q which gives @xmath18=1 .    in this work ,",
    "we have applied the above factorial moment analysis ( generally used to study the fluctuations during a phase transition @xcite ) to study the dynamical fluctuations present in the dna sequences .",
    "a general property noticed for all the genomic sequences ( of statistically significant length ) with a few exceptions is that the distributions of any single or group of nucleotides which has a probability of occurrence @xmath20 has the same variance @xmath21 as that of its complimentary group that has the probability of occurrence @xmath22 , although both have different distribution functions .",
    "this would imply that even a single nucleotide distribution say @xmath2 distribution will have same variance as that of @xmath3 distribution or a @xmath0 distribution will have identical variance as that of @xmath1 distribution .",
    "figure [ sd1 ] shows @xmath21 versus @xmath5 plots for @xmath2 and @xmath0 distributions ( solid curves ) for two typical sequences of @xmath23 ( drosphilia melanogaster , mhc , 22663 bps , @xmath24 @xmath2 , @xmath25 @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xmath28 , @xmath29 @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 ( yeast mitochondrial dna , @xmath32 @xmath2 , @xmath33 @xmath26 , @xmath34 @xmath28 , @xmath35 @xmath30 ) . as can be seen from the figure , the @xmath2 and @xmath0 distributions have same @xmath21 at all scale as that of @xmath3 and @xmath1 distributions ( filled circles ) although the distribution functions of the two complimentary groups need not be identical .",
    "the above agreement is exact for most of the dna sequences ( with a few exceptions ) as well as for the random sequences .",
    "for example , the @xmath21 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 distributions of @xmath31 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 with a @xmath38 mobile transposion ( 9147 bps ) at location 22000 bps ) show @xmath39 to @xmath40 deviations at all scale depending on the total length of the sequences where as for other dna as well as random sequences , this agreement is exact .",
    "( this difference is not visible from figure [ sd1 ] in case of @xmath31 as the deviation is insignificant over a large distance ) .    within the present formalism",
    ", we can also reproduce the result of random walk @xmath41 model ( see appendix for more detail ) by assigning @xmath42 for purine group ( @xmath2 and @xmath26 ) and @xmath43 for pyrimidine group ( @xmath28 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "however , unlike the random walk model of interpreting @xmath44 and @xmath45 as the probability of step up and step down , @xmath13 can be considered as the frequency distribution of @xmath10 which gives the excess or deficit of purines over pyrimidines .",
    "the @xmath21 versus @xmath5 as obtained from this assignment has also been shown in figure [ sd1 ] ( see the dotted curves labeled @xmath46 ) for comparison .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath46 curves shows a parallel shift with respect to the @xmath0 or @xmath1 curves indicating that @xmath0 or @xmath1 distributions and @xmath46 model have similar fluctuations at all scale .",
    "this is an interesting observations , as we can now use @xmath0 or @xmath1 distributions as alternatives to the dna walk representation to study the correlation .",
    "the advantage is , since @xmath10 represents a sum , unlike the dna walk model , the entire spectrum lies to the positive side of the coordinates which is essential to compute various higher moments like @xmath18 of the distributions .",
    "it is also important to note that although the complimentary distributions have same @xmath21 at all scale , the distribution functions need not be exactly identical .",
    "figure [ sd2 ] shows a typical normalized density distribution functions @xmath13 of two complimentary distributions @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the above two sequences ( @xmath31 and @xmath23 ) as a function of @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 is the average count ) at a typical length scale of @xmath49 ( figures in left ) .",
    "the figures to the right shows @xmath13 distributions ( @xmath50-axis is shifted by 100 for clarity ) corresponding to the two purely random sequences having same length and nucleotide contents as that of @xmath23 and @xmath31 sequences .",
    "it is interesting to note that although @xmath21 versus @xmath5 plots are ( nearly ) identical @xmath51 , both distributions have same fluctuations at all scales , the distribution functions are not identical .",
    "this is an important characteristic of a dna sequence which is not found in case of a random one .",
    "the long range correlations are generally studied from the relation @xmath52 where the parameter @xmath4 is extracted from the @xmath21 versus @xmath5 plot in the log - log scale . for the case of a completely random sequence , @xmath53 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath4 from @xmath54 indicates presence of long range correlations .",
    "we have estimated @xmath21 of @xmath2 , @xmath26 , @xmath28 , @xmath30 and @xmath0 distributions for several dna sequences and found that @xmath21 versus @xmath5 plot in the log - log scale is not linear over the entire length . , @xmath26 , @xmath28 and @xmath30 distributions to extract the correlation parameters for the individual nucelotides and @xmath0 distributions to simulate the results of random walk model ] figure [ ec1 ] shows @xmath21 versus @xmath5 plot ( bottom panel ) for a typical @xmath37 sequence of length @xmath55 mbps ( solid curves ) and @xmath56 kbps ( dotted curves ) respectively .",
    "the top panel shows the factorial distributions of @xmath57=2 , 3 , 4 and 6 for a typical @xmath26 distributions , although similar plots can be obtained for other nucleotide distributions as well .",
    "a general feature of the factorial moments of the dna sequence with a few exception is that at short distances , @xmath58 for all @xmath59 and exceeds unity at some point say at @xmath60 .",
    "this behavior is not found in case of a purely random sequence where @xmath18 is always @xmath61 .",
    "further , all @xmath57 s do not cross unity exactly at the same point , @xmath60 being more for higher @xmath57 values . however , this variation is insignificant over a very large scale if we restrict to some of the lower moments say up to @xmath62 .    from these plots and also from the several other studies ,",
    "we make following few observations ; ( i ) the @xmath21 versus @xmath5 plot is not linear through out , rather starts bending around some region ( say @xmath63 , which could be different for different distributions ) indicating a change of slope from @xmath64 to @xmath65 , ( ii ) for most of the cases , while @xmath64 shows weak deviation from @xmath54 , @xmath65 deviates significantly from @xmath54 and also depends on the sequence length @xmath7 , ( iii ) the individual nucleotide distributions may have stronger correlations than any sum like @xmath0 and @xmath1 distributions or any other combinations .",
    "since @xmath21 versus @xmath5 in the log - log plot starts bending around @xmath63 , we can extract the slope by dividing the entire length into two segments ; one for @xmath66 and the other one for @xmath67 .",
    "this can be done by examining each case individually .",
    "however , we have noticed an approximate correlation between this bending region in @xmath21 versus @xmath5 plot and the cross over points @xmath60 of the corresponding factorial moments i.e. the slope changes around the same region where the factorial moments become unity . this is a pure phenomenological observation which is found for several dna sequences as listed in tables with a few exceptions which we will discuss below . it may be mentioned here that although , the two complimentary distributions have same fluctuations , both need not have identical factorial moments .",
    "figure [ lam ] shows the plots of @xmath18 versus @xmath5 for @xmath26 and @xmath68 distribution for a @xmath69 sequence .",
    "since both are complimentary , they have identical fluctuations at all scales ( hence same bending region ) , but the cross over regions in @xmath18 plots are different , being higher for @xmath3 distributions ( due to large average values @xmath48 at all scales ) . while the @xmath60 value of the @xmath26 distribution shows an approximate correlation with the bending region of @xmath21 versus @xmath5 plot where a possible slope change occurs , the @xmath60 values of @xmath68 distribution has no such correlations .",
    "this is true for any complementary distributions of @xmath2 , @xmath26 , @xmath28 and @xmath30 except for @xmath0 and @xmath1 distributions since both have nearly same overlapping cross over regions .",
    "therefore , only the @xmath60 values of the @xmath2 , @xmath26 , @xmath28 , @xmath30 and @xmath0 distributions are used as an approximate length scales @xmath70 .",
    "the entire length of the sequence is divided into two parts one for @xmath71 and other for @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the minimum and maximum of all the @xmath63 corresponding to @xmath2 , @xmath26 , @xmath28 , @xmath30 and @xmath0 distributions .",
    "the @xmath75 , i.e. we have at least @xmath76 independent data sets so that the statistical analysis becomes meaningful . therefore , excluding the region @xmath77 , we have extracted @xmath64 and @xmath65 since the linearity in these two segments are found to be extremely good for most of the cases .",
    "the results are summarized in three tables which covers both intronless and intron containing sequences .",
    "the table shows the length of the sequence @xmath7 used in the analyses , the cross over values @xmath60 ( same as @xmath63 ) , the slope parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 and also the corresponding percentage of the nucleotide contents @xmath78 .",
    "a general observation is that the sequence is weakly correlated at short distance with @xmath64 which is quite close to @xmath54 where as for @xmath67 , the correlation is relatively stronger with a larger value of @xmath65 .",
    "now we discuss a few exceptions like in the case of @xmath31 and @xmath79 ( @xmath80 bacteriophage , @xmath81 bps ) .",
    "figure [ pc1 ] shows the factorial moments of a typical @xmath2 distributions . in both the cases , the factorial moments do not have any cross over point . in case of @xmath31 , the factorial moments are much higher than unity even at small distance and starts decreasing afterwards .",
    "the similar behavior is found for @xmath30 distribution also .",
    "however , the @xmath26 , @xmath28 and @xmath0 distributions do have @xmath63 points .",
    "therefore , using @xmath73 as @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we estimated @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath2 , @xmath26 , @xmath28 , @xmath30 and @xmath0 distributions which are listed in table iii .",
    "the symbol @xmath84 indicates absence of any critical value .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath64 is quite large and in some cases @xmath85 . on the other hand",
    ", the factorial moments of the sequence like @xmath79 do not reach unity at any scale .",
    "the absence of such type of scale has been indicated by the symbol @xmath86 in table iii .",
    "this type of sequences behave like a pure random one having @xmath4 values quite close to @xmath54 .",
    "we have listed a few such sequences with exceptions in table iii .",
    "further , we would like to mention here that we have noticed that the factorial moments for many sequences starts decreasing at large distances . also for a few cases ,",
    "the factorial moments start decreasing even at a very short distances .",
    "consequently , the slope also changes accordingly .",
    "however , we would not like to assign any reasons due to lack of enough statistics .",
    "the slope with @xmath87 corresponds to the case of a normal diffusion process of a random brownian trajectory .",
    "the basic idea of a brownian motion is that of a random walk having a gaussian distribution probability for the position of the random walker after a time @xmath88 with the variance ( @xmath17 ) proportional to @xmath88 ( @xmath89 where @xmath87 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the case of normal diffusion .",
    "however , nature shows enough examples of anomalous diffusion characterized by a variance which does not follow a linear growth in time @xcite . in such cases either the diffusion is accelerated if @xmath90 or the growth is dispersive if @xmath91 . as found in the analyses",
    "( see tables i and ii ) , @xmath92 at large distances for most of the sequences irrespective of their intron contents .",
    "however , a few sequences as shown in table iii , not only peculiar , may also have @xmath4 which decreases at large distances . in such cases , @xmath93 which may indicate the influence of dispersive dynamics .",
    "this aspect needs further investigations .",
    "finally , we would like to add here that @xmath64 is close to @xmath54 for most of the sequences at short distance ( see tables i and ii ) .",
    "although , @xmath87 would imply about a random behavior , it can not be told conclusively from the present analyses unless the short distance effects are taken into consideration @xcite .",
    "in the following , we investigate whether the mosaic character of dna consisting of patches of different composition can account for apparent long range correlations in dna sequences@xcite .",
    "the chargaff s second parity rule states that in a single strand @xmath94 and @xmath95",
    ". however , asymmetries in base composition have been observed in many sequences .",
    "a quantitative estimate of the @xmath96 and @xmath97 skews can be obtained from the relation @xmath98 ( excess of @xmath2 nucleotides over @xmath30 nucleotides ) and @xmath99 ( excess of @xmath26 nucleotides over @xmath28 nucleotides ) .",
    "this is , operationally equivalent to estimating @xmath10 as defined in eq.(1 ) except @xmath10 now represents the count @xmath98 for @xmath96 skew and @xmath99 for @xmath97 skew in a fixed window size of @xmath100 .",
    "we consider @xmath69 as an example and plot @xmath10 ( defined appropriately ) versus @xmath11 where the starting position of the sliding window @xmath11 varies from @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 etc upto @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ skew ] shows the plots of @xmath96 and @xmath97 skews as a function of the length for a typical @xmath69 sequence .",
    "the plots show a change in the direction of the slope with a change in sign of the skew .",
    "the quantity and quality of the skew can be assessed from the @xmath104 or from the inverted-@xmath104 shape of the curves .    from the above plots",
    ", we can identify three well known compositional domains of @xmath69 of size 22000 bps ( @xmath0 contents 0.54 ) , 17000 bps ( @xmath0 contents 0.47 ) and 9000 bps ( @xmath0 contents 0.54 ) .",
    "we also consider an artificially generated sequence by joining three random patches of size 22000 bps , 17000 bps and 9000 bps respectively with appropriate @xmath2 , @xmath26 , @xmath28 and @xmath30 contents .",
    "we also consider another heterogeneous sequence generated from @xmath37 dna by a mobile insertion of tn10 at location 22000 bps .",
    "the corresponding random patches are of size 22000 bps , 9147 bps and 22000 bps respectively and a pure random one of length @xmath7 .",
    "although , both the sequence has same percentage of nucleotide contents in the length @xmath7 , the former is random only patch wise . ]",
    "figure [ lar ] shows the @xmath18 versus @xmath5 plot of a typical @xmath30 distribution for @xmath69 and for an artificially generated sequence ( random only patch wise ) .",
    "interestingly , the factorial moments for both the cases behave similarly .",
    "figure [ rans1 ] shows a similar @xmath105 versus @xmath5 plot both for real and artificially generated ( from random patches ) sequences .",
    "although , in some cases both agree , in general they are not identical at the individual nucleotide levels particularly at large distances ( note that the scale is highly compressed ) .",
    "this deviation would mean that at large distances , the density distribution functions will have significant discrepancy due to different widths .",
    "so at a first look from the @xmath21 versus @xmath5 plot , we can say that the actual dna sequences and the random patches need not have identical slopes @xmath4 ( hence the width @xmath21 ) at large distances for all the nucelotides although they agree in some cases . even at short distances , although the dna and the random sequences have nearly identical width @xmath21 , the full shape of the distributions need not be identical . to demonstrate this , we invoke the principle of complimentary which was mentioned before .",
    "figure [ fig5](a ) shows a @xmath2 and @xmath3 distribution ( left most ) for a @xmath69 sequence at @xmath106 .",
    "notice that although @xmath21 versus @xmath5 plots are identical , i.e. both distributions have same fluctuations at all scales , the distribution functions are not same .",
    "such differences are not found for a real random sequence ( right most ) .",
    "the middle figure corresponds to the case of artificially generated random sequence .",
    "although , the artificially generated sequence mimics the real sequence to some extent , it is not fully capable of reproducing the characteristic of a real sequence .",
    "figure [ fig5](b ) shows another comparison for a @xmath107 sequence for @xmath26 and @xmath68 distributions .",
    "this discrepancy will be more prominent at higher @xmath5 values which the artificially generated sequence can not reproduce .",
    "in @xcite , we had demonstrated that the density distribution @xmath13 is gaussian at short distances and starts deviating from it as the distance increases .",
    "figure [ den ] shows another example where @xmath13 has been plotted for two complimentary distributions at @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively .",
    "the complimentary distributions are nearly identical at short distance and coincide with the random distributions where as @xmath13 distributions for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and pure random one are all different at larger distances .",
    "thus , irrespective of intron contents , most of the sequences follow gaussian statistics at short distances .",
    "however , at large distances , the statistics deviates significantly from the gaussian nature .",
    "in conclusion , we have extended our previous work to extract the slope parameter @xmath4 for several intron containing and intron less dna sequences .",
    "the advantage of the present method is that the variance analysis can be applied to any individual or group of nucleotides .",
    "we believe that the individual nucleotides provide a more fundamental measure of the correlation than any combination or group ( like the dna walk representation ) where the effects may get reduced or washed out .",
    "another interesting aspect is the ( lower ) factorial moments of most of the dna sequences cross unity in a very narrow region in @xmath5 where the @xmath21 versus @xmath5 plot in the log - log scale also shows a bending .",
    "although , a formal justification to this correlation has not been provided , we have used this scale as an approximate measure to exclude the bending regions from the slope analyses . based on this scale ,",
    "we divide the dna sequence into two segments to extract the slope parameters .",
    "it is found that below this scale , the correlation is weak and the dna statistics is essentially gaussian while above this all dna sequences show strong long range correlations irrespective of their intron contents with a significant deviation from the gaussian behavior .",
    "it may be mentioned here that the controversies that exist in this field of research are primarily due to different approaches that are adopted in various models . in this context ,",
    "our analyses is model independent as it only involves the counting of an individual or a group of nucleotides in a given length to build the density distribution . in this work",
    ", we do not advocate for any specific model , although the extracted slope parameters indicate the presence of anomalous diffusion of both enhanced and dispersive nature .",
    "instead , we provide an elegant tool to measure the degree of correlations unambiguously so that the interpretation of the data including theoretical analyses will become more meaningful",
    ". this work will also provide further impetus to develop models for the understanding of the dna dynamics .",
