    "the phase diagram of high-@xmath1 superconductors in the @xmath2-plane is dominated by the interplay of thermal fluctuations and disorder @xcite .",
    "it is believed that at low magnetic fields near @xmath1 the vortex solid melts into a vortex liquid ( vl ) via a first - order melting transition .",
    "prominent examples of high-@xmath3 superconductors exhibiting a solid - liquid melting are the anisotropic compound @xmath4 ( ybco ) , and the strongly layered compound @xmath5 ( bscco ) . when including weak pinning , the solid phase becomes a quasi - long - range ordered bragg glass ( bg ) @xcite . at higher magnetic fields ,",
    "the quasi - long - range order is destroyed and there exist also a vortex glass ( vg ) phase .",
    "the transition is marked by the disappearance of bragg peaks in scattering data .",
    "there is strong experimental evidence especially for bscco @xcite but also for ybco @xcite that the bg - vg transition is first order , although in ybco it has not been confirmed that this is really a proper phase transition , not just a crossover .",
    "so far , the transition line has been identified only by some magnetic anomalies in the response to the external magnetic field .",
    "superconductors where the phase transition line lies near @xmath0 .",
    "the straight line corresponds to the bg - vg , bg - vl first - order lines with an extension of the first - order line beyond the lower multicritical point ( mcp ) .",
    "this is the first scenario discussed in the text .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to a unified bg - vg , bg - vl first - order line without a slush phase ( vs ) corresponding to the second scenario .",
    "the dashed - dotted line is the glass transition line .",
    "the point gp is the intersection point of the glass transition line with the bg - vg , bg - vl line.,width=302,height=226 ]    for bscco it seems that the two melting lines are part of a unified first - order transition line .",
    "for ybco there are two possible experimental scenarios : first , the bg - vg and the bg - vl transition lines meet in a multicritical point ( mcp ) @xcite where the thermodynamical character of the bg - vg line is not clear .",
    "the first - order bg - vl melting line should continue beyond the multicritical point ending in a critical point ( cp ) @xcite where a new fluid - like phase , the slush phase ( vs ) , emerges ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the second scenario consists of a unified melting line @xcite without a multicritical point which is the case for bscco .",
    "we note that the experimentally realized scenario is strongly sensitive on the doping of the superconductor @xcite .    beside the first - order transition lines",
    ", there exits a glass transition line between the vg and vs phases , if the vs phase exists , or between the vg and vl phases , if vs is absent .",
    "this glass transition line was predicted by fisher _",
    "_ in ref . , and",
    "observed when confirming scaling rules for special current - voltage characteristics across the transition line @xcite .",
    "alternatively it was proposed in ref .   that the glass transition is window glass like with no scaling .",
    "some people define an irreversibility line beyond which magnetization sweeps are no longer reversible @xcite .",
    "this seems to coincide with the glass transition line .",
    "a direct experimental determination of the order of the glass transition in the vortex system of ybco has not yet been possible . for bscco , there is recent experimental evidence that the glass transition line could be of second order @xcite . a sketch of the phase diagram for ybco which contains the two scenarios is shown in fig .  1 .    beside experiments to determine the phase diagram , information comes from computer simulations based on the langevin equation @xcite or on frustrated xy - models @xcite .",
    "the langevin simulations confirm the second phase scenario without a slush phase , and the existence of a multicritical point on the melting line being unclear . in the frustrated xy model ,",
    "the existence of a slush phase and of a multicritical point are also controversial @xcite .",
    "in addition , lidmar @xcite carried out a monte - carlo simulation based on a defect model where he only obtains a first - order melting line and a glass transition line , but not a vs phase .",
    "analytic approaches are based mainly on the ginzburg landau model @xcite , which is especially useful for ybco , the cage model @xcite , or the elasticity model of the vortex lattice @xcite with pinning .",
    "the ginzburg landau model with pinning was analyzed recently by li _",
    "@xcite where they found a phase diagram of the second scenario , with a single first - order melting line between the vg and vl phases as well as between the bg and vg phases , without an additional slush phase .",
    "the calculation was restricted to second order in the disorder potential . in a recent paper",
    "they also carry out an analysis of a possible glass transition line in the fluid phase of the ginzburg - landau model where they found such a line only under a certain disorder model @xcite by using replica symmetry - breaking techniques which we also use in this paper . in @xcite the phenomenological lindemann criterion extended to include pinning was used in order to calculate the bg - vg and bg - vl transition lines . in @xcite defects",
    "were taken into account for determining the transition lines .",
    "these approaches allow for an explanation of both phase scenarios .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate the above phase transitions in a defect melting model which was recently constructed for the study of defect - induced melting of square ( ybco ) and triangular ( bscco ) vortex lattices .",
    "the model is a modification of a simpler version in ref . which explained the melting transition of ordinary crystals by the statistical mechanics of defects on a hypothetical square lattice .",
    "this model was generalized for two - dimensional triangular crystals in ref .. the model is gaussian in the elastic strains and takes into account the defect degrees of freedom by integer valued gauge fields .",
    "the melting line is found from a lowest - order approximation , in which one identifies the melting point with the intersection of the high - temperature expansion of the free energy density dominated by defect fluctuations with the low - temperature expansion dominated by elastic fluctuations .    in this paper",
    "we shall consider , in addition , the effect of weak disorder on the melting line near @xmath0 .",
    "this will lead to a determination of the bg - vg and bg - vl transition line .",
    "the most prominent example for a high-@xmath3 superconductors with such a melting line is ybco but also superconductors with a low critical temperature @xmath1 such as bcs type superconductors or with a small anisotropy factor should have a melting line near @xmath0 . for concrete calculations , we will restrict us in the following to the case of ybco .",
    "the paper will first review the model and derive an effective hamiltonian for the vortex lattice in the low - temperature solid phase and the high - temperature fluid phase without disorder .",
    "the model has two mutually representations .",
    "one can be evaluated efficiently in the low - temperature phase , the other in the high - temperature phase .",
    "the lowest approximation to the former contains only elastic fluctuations of the vortex lattice without defects .",
    "the dual representation sums over all integer - valued stress configurations , which to lowest approximation are completely frozen out .",
    "the tranverse part of the vortex fluctuations in the high - temperature approximation corresponds to non - interacting three - dimensional elastic strings where the length in z - direction is discretized with the dislocation length as the lattice spacing @xcite .",
    "it is well known , that the lower critical dimension for an elastic string in a random potential @xcite is three .",
    "this dimension separates the string system in higher dimensions with two phases ( a disorder dominated low - temperature phase and a temperature dominated high - temperature phase ) from a single disorder dominated phase in lower dimensions .",
    "we encounter a similar situation for the high temperature hamiltonian in sect .",
    "v. this is the reason , why we shall have to consider higher - order expansion terms @xcite .",
    "we shall first expand the free energy to lowest order in the disorder potential in section iii .",
    "the result will be a unified melting line .",
    "this line bends to lower magnetic fields in the direction for decreasing temperatures due to the disorder , in agreement with experiments .",
    "we obtain a remarkable reentrant behavior for this line .",
    "we do not obtain , however , a good agreement with experiments at low magnetic fields . in order to get better agreement with experiment and to determine also the glass transition line we further calculate , in the solid low - temperature phase and in the fluid high - temperature phase , the free energy non - perturbatively by using once the replica - trick and further the variational approach set up by mzard and parisi @xcite for random manifolds and spin - glasses",
    "it is based on replacing the non - quadratic part of the replicated hamiltonian by quadratic one , with possible mixing of replica fields .",
    "a transition line from a liquid to a glass consists within the mzard - parisi approach on a boundary in thermodynamical space from a replica symmetric quadratic hamiltonian to a hamiltonian which breaks the symmetry in the replica fields .",
    "the best quadratic hamiltonian in the low - temperature solid phase is full replica symmetry broken corresponding to the bg - phase . in the high - temperature phase",
    "we find a region where the solution is full replica symmetric corresponding to the vl phase .",
    "furthermore , we find a glassy region ( vg ) were the optimal quadratic hamiltonian depends on the form of the disorder correlation function . by carrying a comprehensive stability analysis in section vii",
    "we show that for the form of the glassy state the kurtosis @xmath6 defined in ( [ 880 ] ) as functional on the positional disorder function is relevant .",
    "a gaussian correlation function has kurtosis @xmath7 . for high magnetic fields near @xmath0",
    "we obtain : + for @xmath8 we get a one - step replica symmetry broken solution with a third - order phase transition line .",
    "this corresponds to a correlation function with flatter tip and smaller tail than the gaussian correlation function . in the case",
    "@xmath9 we obtain a full replica symmetry broken solution .",
    "the free energy has the same form as in the one - step replica symmetry breaking case leading also to a third - order glass transition line .",
    "disorder correlation functions with smaller tips and larger tails than the gaussian correlation function belong to this case . for lower magnetic fields",
    "we obtain that the border in the disorder function space of one - step and continous replica symmetry broken solutions moves to lower kurtosis .",
    "the vg - vl phase transition happens just at the depinning temperature of a one - dimensional string in three dimensions subjected to impurities @xcite .",
    "we calculate the free energies in the low - temperature solid and in both high - temperature phases . by the intersection criterion",
    "we obtain further the first - order bg - vl and bg - vg transition line .",
    "we do not find an additional first - order line which separates the slush phase vs from the vortex liquid vl .",
    "summarizing , we obtain within our approach only the second scenario . in the low - temperature solid phase our analysis corresponds to the analysis of korshunov @xcite and giamarchi and doussal @xcite using the mzard - parisi approach for the vortex lattice system in random potentials .",
    "because this system does not contain defects only the bragg glass phase can be described correctly . within our approach",
    "we include beside the disorder ones also the defect degrees of freedom by integer valued fields which are important to obtain the melting transition .",
    "this allows us to compute the whole phase diagram for ybco . in this sense",
    "our theory is a direct generalization of the earlier vortex lattice approaches in random potentials .    beside the results above ,",
    "we give in appendix  b a derivation of some stability theorems of saddle point solutions similar to the theorems of carlucci _ et al . _",
    "@xcite derived within the large @xmath10-limit approach of mzard and parisi @xcite where @xmath11 are the number of components of the random manifold . because in general the number of components of a given random manifold is rather small it is useful to generalize these theorems also to the variational approach of mezard - parisi not existent in literature yet",
    "the paper is organized as follows : + in section  ii we state the model of the vortex lattice with defects and impurity degrees of freedoms .",
    "we derive in section  iii the effective low and high - temperature hamiltonian of the vortex lattice without impurities . with the help of these effective hamiltonians",

    "_ @xcite . we just mention that the @xmath54-pinning mechanism has its origin in fluctuations in @xmath1 in the ginzburg - landau free energy and the @xmath55-pinning mechanism is due to fluctuations in the mean free path coming from fluctuations in the impurity density .",
    "the parameter @xmath51 is different for both pinning mechanisms @xcite : @xmath56 the correlation functions for both mechanisms can be derived in fourier space by taking into account the order parameter shape of a single vortex @xcite .",

    "we shall see below in section  vii that this is the momentum region of the disorder correlation function which determines mainly the form of the free energy in the fluid phase near the glass transition line and thus the order of the glass transition .",
    "other correlation mechanism as for example screening of impurities are not taken into account in these single vortex disorder correlation functions .",
    "the screening of impurity potentials is important because the nearest neighbor distance between impurities is typically of the same size as the coherence length @xmath48 @xcite .",

    "we restrict us to the effective disorder potential ( [ 15 ] ) where in contrast to the glass transition line , the final energy expression should not change much when changing the disorder potential .",
