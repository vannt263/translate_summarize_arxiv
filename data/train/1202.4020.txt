    "the comparison of cross - section predictions with data on single - inclusive hadron production in hadronic collisions , @xmath0+@xmath6 , is important for understanding perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) . for hadrons produced with transverse momenta @xmath7 ,",
    "the cross section factorizes into a convolution involving long - distance and short - distance components  @xcite .",
    "long - distance components include universal parton - distribution functions ( pdfs ) describing the partonic structure of the initial hadrons and fragmentation functions ( ffs ) for the final - state hadron .",
    "the short - distance part describes the hard scattering of partons .",
    "the long - distance components , pdfs and ffs , can be extracted from other processes , such as deep - inelastic scattering and hadron production in @xmath8 colliders .",
    "this allows for a test of the short - distance part of the convolution , which can be estimated using pqcd .",
    "in particular , differences between data and predictions can indicate the importance of neglected higher - order terms in the expansion or power - suppressed contributions  @xcite .",
    "next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) pqcd and collinear factorization successfully describe rhic cross - section measurements at a center - of - mass energy ( @xmath9 ) of 200  gev for midrapidity neutral pions  @xcite , jets  @xcite , and direct photons  @xcite , as well as forward rapidity pions and kaons  @xcite .",
    "however , at lower @xmath9 , in particular in fixed - target experiments with @xmath10 gev , nlo pqcd calculations significantly underpredict hadron production , by factors of three or more  @xcite .",
    "the consistency between nlo estimations and data at low @xmath9 was improved @xcite by including the resummation of large logarithmic corrections to the partonic cross section to all orders in the strong coupling @xmath11 .",
    "the corrections are of the form @xmath12 for the @xmath13th - order term in the perturbative expansion . here",
    "@xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the transverse momentum of the parton fragmenting into the observed hadron with a fraction @xmath16 of the parton transverse momentum , and @xmath17 is the partonic center - of - mass energy where @xmath18 are momentum fractions carried by two interacting partons .",
    "the corrections are especially relevant in the threshold regime @xmath19 in which the initial partons have just enough energy to produce a high - transverse - momentum parton fragmenting into the observed hadron . in this regime gluon bremsstrahlung",
    "is suppressed , and these corrections are large  @xcite . however , the addition of the resummed next - to - leading - log ( nll ) terms to an nlo calculation may not provide the best means of describing data in a given kinematic region , for example , when the ( unknown ) higher - order terms that are omitted from the calculation have comparable magnitude and opposite sign to the nll terms .",
    "it is therefore important to test pqcd calculations against data in a region of intermediate @xmath9 , to better define the kinematic ranges over which pqcd calculations can be applied with confidence .    the phenix - dectector data presented here for nonidentified charged - hadron production make use of approximately five times the acceptance and different detection techniques compared to our previous identified - charged - hadron analysis  @xcite .",
    "the new results allow tests of nlo and nll predictions based on an independent measurement . in addition , the theoretical calculations make use of different fragmentation functions than for identified particle calculations . alternatively , assuming the reliability of the short - distance aspects of the theory , the data may be used to refine our knowledge of fragmentation functions .",
    "present measurements also cover a greater @xmath20 range than the identified charged - hadron cross sections , where the measured momentum ranges for pions , kaons , and protons are 0.33 gev/@xmath3 , 0.42 gev/@xmath3 and 0.54.5 gev/@xmath3 respectively  @xcite .",
    "these cross - section measurements of nonidentified charged hadrons ( combinations of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) are also important as baselines for extracting nuclear modification factors in high-@xmath24 hadron production in heavy ion collisions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the charged hadrons in these measurements were produced from collisions of transversely- and longitudinally - polarized proton beams , a unique capability of rhic  @xcite . while the cross - section measurements discussed above require averaging over the beam polarizations , sorting the hadron yields by colliding proton helicities ( for longitudinal beam polarizations ) provides sensitivity to the helicity pdfs  @xcite .",
    "the ability to probe helicity pdfs is essential for understanding the spin structure of the proton  @xcite .",
    "the spin of the proton originates from the spin and orbital angular momenta of its quark , antiquark , and gluon constituents .",
    "the contribution carried by quark and antiquark spin , determined from polarized deep - inelastic scattering ( pdis ) experiments  @xcite using polarized leptons and polarized nucleons , is @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "this is surprisingly small  @xcite and implies that the majority of the spin of the proton must originate from gluon spin and/or orbital angular momentum .",
    "colliding longitudinally - polarized proton beams provides sensitivity to the gluon - helicity distribution function at leading order . the helicity - dependent difference in hadron production",
    "is defined as : @xmath26,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the superscripts @xmath27 and @xmath28 refer to same and opposite helicity combinations of the colliding protons  @xcite .",
    "factorization allows this to be written as a convolution of the long- and short - distance terms summed over all possible flavors for the partonic interaction @xmath29 , where @xmath3 fragments into the detected hadron @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the polarized pdfs of the colliding partons carrying light - cone momentum fraction @xmath33 evaluated at factorization scale @xmath34 .",
    "the fragmentation function of scattered parton @xmath3 into hadron @xmath30 with fraction @xmath35 of the scattered parton momentum is @xmath36 at fragmentation scale @xmath37 .",
    "the helicity - dependent difference in the cross section of the hard partonic scattering @xmath29 is denoted by @xmath38 and is calculable in perturbative qcd .",
    "cross section calculations to finite order in @xmath11 have a dependence on factorization and renormalization scales @xmath34 and @xmath39 .    instead of directly measuring the helicity - dependent cross - section difference @xmath40",
    ", we extract the double - longitudinal spin asymmetry defined as the ratio of the polarized to unpolarized cross sections @xmath41 . here",
    ", @xmath42 is the helicity - averaged ( unpolarized ) cross section @xmath43/2 $ ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath44 has smaller systematic uncertainties since some of the uncertainties cancel .    at @xmath45 gev",
    ", the production of final - state hadrons at midrapidity in a transverse momentum range @xmath46 gev/@xmath3 is dominated by quark - gluon scattering  @xcite .",
    "this makes the asymmetry reported here , @xmath47+@xmath48 , sensitive to the polarized gluon pdf @xmath49 at leading order , and more sensitive to its sign than processes dominated by gluon - gluon scattering or which produce isospin - symmetric particles .",
    "for example , preferential fragmentation of up quarks into positive pions and down quarks into negative pions , combined with the fact that the up quark helicity pdf is positive and the down quark helicity pdf is negative , would lead to an ordering of the asymmetries of pions ( charged and neutral ) directly sensitive to the sign of the gluon helicity pdf .",
    "positive @xmath49 would lead to @xmath50 , whereas a negative @xmath49 would imply an opposite ordering .",
    "these results can be combined with data from polarized collider and fixed target experiments in a global analysis to reduce uncertainties on the gluon helicity distribution  @xcite .",
    "this analysis uses the phenix central arm spectrometers .",
    "each arm has an acceptance covering a pseudorapidity range @xmath51 and @xmath52 in azimuth  @xcite .",
    "the phenix central magnet creates an axial magnetic field with @xmath53 t@xmath54 m at @xmath55 in this region .",
    "midrapidity charged hadrons are tracked in the drift chambers ( dc ) , which are located outside the magnetic field with an inner radius of 2.0  m and outer radius of 2.4  m. the tracks are reconstructed as nearly straight lines and yield the deflection in the axial magnetic field to determine the transverse momentum with a resolution @xmath56 ( gev/@xmath3 ) @xcite . the first term in the resolution is dominated by multiple scattering in material before the dc , while the second arises from the finite angular resolution of the dc .",
    "the momentum scale is set by requiring the proton mass reconstructed from the measured momentum and time of flight to match the known proton mass .",
    "track reconstruction also utilizes two layers of pad chambers ( pc ) , which are multiwire proportional chambers with pad readout  @xcite .",
    "the first layer , pc1 , is located after the dc , with an average radius of @xmath57 m. pc1 information is used in conjunction with the dc hits and vertex information to determine the polar angle for each charged track .",
    "the outermost layer pc3 is at an average radius of @xmath58  m and is used for charged track selection by matching pc3 hit positions with tracks projected using information from the dc and pc1 and the measured event vertex . matching projected tracks with hit positions in pc3 also helps in rejecting decay backgrounds from primary hadrons .",
    "vertex and timing information is provided by two beam - beam counters ( bbcs )  @xcite placed around the beam pipe .",
    "the bbcs are located 1.44  m forward and backward of the nominal interaction point .",
    "each bbc comprises an array of 64 phototubes fitted with @xmath59 cm long quartz radiators .",
    "the phototubes detect erenkov radiation from charged particles traversing the quartz .",
    "the detectors cover a pseudorapidity range of @xmath60 , and a full @xmath61 in azimuth .",
    "a coincidence of hits from the two bbcs forms the minimum bias trigger , with timing information providing the location of the event vertex along the beam line with a few cm precision .    to eliminate the @xmath62 background due to photon conversion in material before the dc ( primarily the beam pipe and dc entrance window )",
    ", the analysis uses information from a ring imaging erenkov detector ( rich )  @xcite located after the dc .",
    "the rich uses co@xmath63 at atmospheric pressure as a radiator , with a momentum threshold of @xmath64  mev/@xmath3 for @xmath62 and @xmath65  gev/@xmath3 for charged pions . a rich veto ( ensuring no rich hits )",
    "is used to reject @xmath62 and results in an upper transverse - momentum limit of @xmath66 gev/@xmath3 for charged hadrons in the analysis .",
    "zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) , which detect neutral particles near the beam pipe ( @xmath67 mrad ) are used in conjunction with the bbc to estimate the systematic uncertainty on the relative luminosity for the asymmetry measurements  @xcite .",
    "the bbc and zdc are also used to determine the integrated luminosity measurement  @xcite .",
    "the stable spin direction of polarized protons in rhic is vertical .",
    "the spin direction can be rotated into the longitudinal direction at the phenix interaction region using pairs of spin rotators .",
    "the polarizations of the beams at rhic are measured every few hours by carbon target polarimeters  @xcite , which are normalized to an absolute measurement with a hydrogen jet target polarimeter  @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are the first measurements of the cross section of inclusive charged - hadron production at midrapidity in the transverse momentum range @xmath68 gev/@xmath3 from @xmath0+@xmath0 collisions at @xmath1 gev .",
    "the analysis techniques are similar to methods described in ref .",
    "@xcite and are briefly explained in sect .",
    "[ sec : crossana ] .",
    "the cross section results are presented and discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : crossresult ] .      approximately @xmath69 bbc - triggered events corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath70 from polarization - averaged @xmath71 data taken in 2006 have been analyzed .",
    "we calculate the midrapidity charged - hadron production cross section using the following formula : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the @xmath71 cross section seen by the bbc as measured in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath74 is the total number of bbc - triggered events analyzed , @xmath75 is the correction factor for the smearing of track @xmath20 owing to the momentum resolution of the detectors as well as multiple scattering of the hadron tracks , @xmath76 is the correction factor for bbc trigger bias and @xmath77 is the combined correction factor for geometrical acceptance of the detectors and reconstruction efficiency .",
    "the reconstructed charged tracks in the transverse momentum range @xmath78 gev/@xmath3 from events with vertices within @xmath79 cm of the nominal interaction point are matched to projected hit positions in pc3 in azimuthal ( @xmath80 ) and beam direction ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "distributions of the matching variables ( difference between the projected track position and actual hits on pc3 , termed pc3d@xmath80 and pc3d@xmath16 ) are fit with the combination of a signal gaussian and a second gaussian for background .",
    "figure  [ fig : matching ] demonstrates the method for a sample @xmath20 bin .",
    "the width of the fit to the signal distribution is used to impose a simultaneous selection window of @xmath81 for both matching variables .",
    "the histogram represents data ; the dashed line represents a two - gaussian fit . ]",
    "the background to these measurements comes from several sources .",
    "one source is soft electrons from the magnet pole faces , and another is decays in flight of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "not all of these electrons are rejected by the rich cut .",
    "off - vertex electrons and daughter particles with a perpendicular momentum kick from the decay are reconstructed as apparent high-@xmath20 tracks , but with wide gaussian track matching distributions .",
    "the background fraction in each of the @xmath20 bins is determined by using the distributions of the matching variables .",
    "background fractions , which are 25% for @xmath82 gev/@xmath3 and @xmath83 in the highest @xmath20 bin , are subsequently subtracted from hadron yields .",
    "an additional source of background is the feed - down background produced by weak decays of mostly @xmath84 particles close to the event vertex with apparent momenta close to their true momenta and matching distributions peaked under the signal .",
    "feed - down contributions to the detected protons and antiprotons from weak decays of @xmath84 s and heavier hyperons are estimated using input @xmath84 and @xmath85 spectra from @xmath71 measurements at @xmath86 gev at the isr  @xcite and at @xmath1 gev at phenix with a geant3  @xcite - based simulation of the phenix detector .",
    "the fractional contributions of the feed - down protons and antiprotons are independent of @xmath20 above @xmath87  gev/@xmath3 and are close to @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "below @xmath87 gev/@xmath3 the fractions increase with decreasing @xmath20 and are roughly @xmath90 and @xmath91 for protons and antiprotons respectively at @xmath92 gev/@xmath3 .",
    "background - subtracted yields are corrected for angular resolution of the dc and for smearing of the reconstructed momenta resulting from multiple scattering of tracks , which depends on hadron mass . to account for the acceptance of the phenix detector system and the varying efficiency for different hadrons ,",
    "single - particle monte - carlo simulations are performed and verified by comparing the live detector area between data and monte carlo , and appropriate correction factors are determined separately for each hadron species .",
