    "the delay experienced by a quantum particle due to the interaction with a scattering region has been the subject of intense investigation for more than thirty years in several areas that include nuclear and condensed matter physics.@xcite the interest in this subject has resurged due to the recent appearance of theoretical investigations in chaotic systems@xcite and atomic physics;@xcite the later motivated by experiments of interaction of light with matter during a mean time with attosecond precision.@xcite    the delay time first introduced by wigner@xcite for one channel and its multichannel generalization by smith,@xcite in the so - called wigner - smith time delay matrix , is written in terms of the scattering matrix @xmath0 and its derivative with respect to the energy @xmath1 . in units of the heisenberg time @xmath2 , it is given by @xmath3 the eigenvalues of @xmath4 represent the delay time on each channel and the wigner time delay is the average of these proper delay times . in the context of mesoscopic systems the electrochemical capacitance of a mesoscopic capacitor is described by the wigner time delay.@xcite some other transport observables that depend on the proper delay times are the thermopower,@xcite the derivative of the conductance with respect to the fermi energy,@xcite the dc pumped current at zero bias,@xcite among others ( see for instance ref .   and references there in ) . for ballistic systems with chaotic classical dynamics , these physical observables fluctuates with respect small variations of external parameters , like an applied magnetic field , the fermi energy or the system shape,@xcite the proper delay times are of interest in the characterization of their universal statistics .",
    "the distribution of the proper delay times is given in terms of the joint distribution of their reciprocals , known as the laguerre ensemble,@xcite which depends on the particular symmetry present in the problem ; an interesting feature of this ensemble is the presence of level repulsion , as occur in the spectral statistics of several complex quantum - mechanical systems .",
    "alternatively , the partial delay times defined as the energy derivative of phase shifts are also useful in the characterization of chaotic scattering.@xcite although the partial times are correlated , this correlation is of different nature than that between the proper delay times ; they do not show the level repulsion.@xcite in the one channel situation the proper an partial delay times are identical to the wigner time delay @xmath5 whose distribution is known for all symmetry classes:@xcite @xmath6 ( 4 ) in the presence of time reversal and presence ( absence ) of spin - rotation symmetry , and @xmath7 in the absence of time reversal symmetry . for the general case of arbitrary number of channels ,",
    "the distribution of a partial time is known for @xmath7@xcite and for @xmath6 an expression in terms of quadratures was obtained for non - ideal coupling.@xcite in the ideal coupling case only the tails of the distribution are known and the corrected prediction does not seem to be right.@xcite moreover , the @xmath8 symmetry is seldom discussed and the distribution of partial times for this symmetry class is not given yet .    in the present paper , we obtain , by an inductive reasoning , a general expression for the probability distribution of the partial delay times .",
    "this was done by extracting the essence that comes from the level repulsion in the joint distribution of proper delay times , that transcends to the @xmath9th moment of a proper delay time.@xcite we test our formula by random matrix theory simulations for all symmetry classes and for several number of channels .    in the next section",
    "we establish the theoretical framework of the proper and partial delay times ; we review the known results for the @xmath9th moment of a proper delay time from which we obtain a general expression of the probability distribution of the partial times , for all symmetry classes and any number of channels . in sect .",

    "this case is denoted by @xmath6 and the corresponding ensemble is the circular orthogonal ensemble ( coe ) . in the presence of tri , half - integral spin , and no rotation symmetry , @xmath0 is self - dual and the ensemble of self - dual scattering matrices is the circular symplectic ensemble ( cse ) , labeled by @xmath8 . in the diagonal form , the @xmath0 matrix can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a @xmath12 unitary , the matrix of eigenvectors , and @xmath21 is the diagonal matrix of eigenphases , @xmath22 with @xmath23 the kronecker delta .      a symmetrized form of the wigner - smith time delay matrix can be written in dimensionless units as@xcite @xmath24 where @xmath1 is the energy and @xmath2 is the heisenberg time ( @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the mean level spacing ) .",

    "the hamiltonian approach , also known as the heidelberg approach , is the best suited for the calculation of the energy derivative of the scattering matrix since it is written explicitly in terms of the energy , namely  @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an @xmath47-dimensional hamiltonian matrix that describes the chaotic dynamics of the system , with @xmath47 resonant single - particle states , and @xmath48 is a @xmath49 matrix , independent of the energy , which couples these resonant states with the @xmath16 propagating modes in the leads ; @xmath50 stands for the unit matrix of dimension @xmath51 . for ideal coupling of uncorrelated equivalent channels , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) for the matrix elements of @xmath48.@xcite    ) , for the distribution of @xmath55 ( we take @xmath56 ) in the @xmath6 case . ]    for chaotic systems , @xmath46 is a random matrix chosen from one of the gaussian ensembles : orthogonal ( @xmath6 ) , unitary ( @xmath7 ) or symplectic ( @xmath8 ) .",
