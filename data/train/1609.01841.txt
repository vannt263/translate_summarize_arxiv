    "the origin of linear instability and turbulence , and subsequent angular momentum transport in various classes of shear flows , specifically in astrophysical accretion disks , which are rotating shear flows , has not been explained completely yet .",
    "however , it is understood from observed data that , to explain the accretion in astrophysical disks , some sort of viscosity is required . in the absence of adequate molecular viscosity @xcite , turbulent viscosity was argued to play the main role in the accretion process by shakura and sunyaev @xcite . nevertheless , a keplerian accretion disk is linearly stable , thus proving it difficult to explain the origin of turbulence in the absence of any unstable linear perturbation .",
    "similar problem exists in some laboratory flows .",
    "for example , plane poiseuille flow becomes turbulent in the laboratory at a reynolds number @xmath0 , whereas linear theory predicts it to be stable up to @xmath1 .",
    "an even more severe discrepancy , which has a direct interest to astrophysics , occurs in the case of plane couette flow , which is shown to be turbulent for @xmath2 as small as @xmath3 in laboratory experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "however theoretical analysis shows it to be linearly stable for all @xmath2 up to infinity .",
    "subsequently , balbus and hawley applied the idea of magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) @xcite , established originally by velikhov @xcite and chandrasekhar @xcite , to resolve the issue of instability and turbulence in magnetized flows and , hence , in some kinds of accretion disks .",
    "but the puzzle remains in laboratory flows which are colder and , hence , mri would not work there .",
    "moreover , to work mri successfully , magnetic field strength has to be weak ( weaker than a critical value depending on @xmath2 @xcite ) .",
    "hence , for global purposes , a full scale exploration of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) flows is needed .",
    "exploration of mhd instabilities in various fluid systems is nothing new .",
    "the comprehensive descriptions of their various properties including eigenspectra of perturbation and stability are given in @xcite in the limit of ideal mhd and in @xcite in the presence of visco - resistive effects .",
    "the properties of eigenspectra and instability have also been explored to a great degree , even in two dimensions , in the context of tokamak fusion physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . moreover , ideal mhd spectra for cylindrical plasma column were explored in order to investigate that how the local criteria govern the existence of the accumulating eigenmodes @xcite . in the context of astrophysical accretion disks and other transonic flows ,",
    "full scale mhd instability was found in radially stratified flows @xcite as well as in axisymmetric plasmas having poloidal flow speed exceeding critical slow magnetosonic speed @xcite . in a completely different approach",
    ", mhd instability and plausible turbulence were also argued in accretion disks and other magnetized flows by computing various types of correlation of perturbations @xcite .    generally , below a certain critical value of @xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) , the linear stability analysis would predict a flow to be stable , but sometimes the most minutely controlled experiments would result in turbulence below @xmath4 set by the theory . that exactly is being observed in laboratory experiments and numerical simulations of plane poiseuille flow mentioned above , when its @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "such a discrepancy would lead one to believe that simple linear stability analysis is probably not the best tool to enlighten the onset of turbulence . in a related field , trefethen , embree , schmid and henningson @xcite explored the idea of nonnormality .",
    "under this idea , it is shown that even in the complete absence of a linearly unstable mode , perturbations could exhibit ` transient energy growth ( teg ) ' @xcite .",
    "this happens when the eigenfunctions of a linear system are not completely orthogonal in nature and , because of that , certain combinations of the eigenfunctions and initial conditions , may develop a significant amplitude of ( transient ) energy growth , despite being stable overall .",
    "this form of growth , as the name suggests , occurs only for a short period of time , but its magnitude could be sufficient ( depending upon the parameters of flows ) to cause nonlinearity and plausible turbulence in fluid flows .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the visco - resistive ( including fluid viscosity and magnetic diffusivity ) mhd equations for three cases of flows : with and without the presence of coriolis ( rotational ) effects , to explore their linear stability and teg analyses .",
    "we precisely consider a small section of    * plane couette flow , * keplerian flow , * constant angular momentum flow or classic taylor - couette flow .",
    "the second class of flow often mimics a small section of an astrophysical accretion disk and , hence , our results , as will be shown , have important implications in astrophysics .",
    "the present work is the sequel of the work @xcite by the present group towards the application of nonnormality to mhd shear flows , including astrophysical flows . in the latest work",
    ", the authors approached the problem in the lagrangian formulation .",
    "while that is an elegant way of approaching it , in particular for the purposes of that work , to uncover certain other physics , eulerian approach is more useful .",
    "hence , in the present work , we undertake the eulerian approach to fulfill the underlying physics .",
    "overall , the latest work @xcite and the present one complement to each other , to understand the full picture of the problem .",
    "we begin with the description of model with basic equations in  [ basiceq ] , followed by perturbed fluid equations in  [ perturbeq ] .",
    "we then describe these equations in an eigenvalue formulation in  [ eigform ] , introduce and apply the concept of teg to them in  [ transen ] and discuss the numerical considerations used to solve the problem ( for eigenvalue formulation and teg ) in  [ numcond ] .",
    "subsequently , we explore a simpler analytical scheme in  [ anal ] , which is useful to interpret and understand the numerical results presented in  [ numrel ] .",
    "finally we end with a summary and conclusion in  [ summa ] .",
    "we consider a small section of a shear flow ( shearing box ) including rotational effect at a distance @xmath6 from the center of flow ( e.g. compact object / star in the cases of accretion disks ) of size @xmath7 in the @xmath8-direction .",
    "the background unperturbed velocity ( in the limit @xmath9 corresponding to linear shear ) and magnetic fields are respectively given as @xmath10 @xmath11 which are generally the solutions of unperturbed momentum balance equations , where @xmath12 is the background flow speed at the boundaries of shearing box , describing by the local cartesian coordinates , in the @xmath8-direction ( locally @xmath13-direction ) .",
    "now the navier - stokes equations with magnetic body force in the rotating frame of reference , the induction equation , the continuity and solenoidal conditions ( in cgs units , unless otherwise stated ) , for the unperturbed flow in the shearing box are given by @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the coriolis vector , arisen due to angular velocity of the fluids , defined as @xmath19 @xmath20 is the total fluid pressure due to all external body forces including that due to central gravity , @xmath21 is the fluid density , @xmath22 is time and @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath25 is the magnetic diffusivity and @xmath26 parameterizes the shearing in the flow , with @xmath27 corresponding to keplerian disk , @xmath28 corresponding to constant angular momentum or taylor - couette flow and @xmath29 corresponding to plane couette flow .",

    "note importantly that although the form of the solution in eq .",
    "( [ qsol ] ) is chosen in the spirit of normal - mode expansion , @xmath63 is not self - adjoint and , hence , the resulting set of eigenmodes ( @xmath67-s ) may be highly sensitive to the choice of perturbations and the eigenfunctions may be nearly linearly dependent ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , thus effectively called nonnormal .",
    "figure [ nonorvec ] represents the real parts of two pairs of stable eigenvectors , for a keplerian flow as an example , whose inner - product is non - negligible .",
    "it clearly shows the nonnormal nature of eigenmodes .",
    "the shapes of eigenmodes indicate how nonnormal they are , when for a self - adjoint operator the eigenmodes are perfectly normal ( orthogonal ) with zero inner - product . note that the inner - product is computed for the complete nonnormal eigenvectors ( and not just their real parts ) in each pair .",
    "now , these eigenvalue equations are well studied for purely hydrodynamical cases ( orr - sommerfeld and squire equations ) without and with rotation @xcite , and have been shown to have no unstable modes for the velocity and vorticity fields .",
    "however , the above set of four equations , in fact , has an unstable set of solutions corresponding to mri , which is explored in depth in subsequent sections .",
    "the application of teg was initially explored by farrell @xcite , reddy & henningson @xcite , trefethen and his collaborators @xcite to explain observed instabilities in linearly stable couette flow and poiseuille flow ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "later on , the concept was further modified and applied to the cases of rotating shear flows @xcite . here",
    "we further extend and explore this in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "such an exploration was pursued recently in the lagrangian formulation @xcite .",
    "in the eulerian formulation , here we will be in a position to explore various kinds of eigenspectra , depending on , e.g. , the values of @xmath26 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and their role in controlling teg of perturbation . note that the structure of eigenspectra is also related to the nature of nonnormality , which further controls the perturbation energy growth factor , and emergence of nonlinearity and plausible turbulence in the flows .",
    "the expression for perturbation energy growth is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the volume of the chosen system ( e.g. shearing box ) .",
    "using the solution form given by eq .",
    "( [ qsol ] ) in eq .",

    "the 2-norm can be numerically computed via a scheme involving optimization of the coefficients @xmath75 , as outlined in previous work @xcite .",
    "briefly put , the perturbation energy can be written as a sum of complex conjugate products of the 4 perturbation variables and derivative of two of the variables ( @xmath76 can be substituted in terms of @xmath77 ) , which can be arrived at by multiplying @xmath78 with its complex conjugate resulting in a hermitian matrix @xmath79 . further , to obtain the expression for optimum growth , @xmath79 is decomposed in terms of a lower - triangular matrix @xmath80 by means of a cholesky - decomposition , which is then used to write the final expression of energy growth for @xmath81 eigenvalues as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the diagonal matrix with elements as @xmath81 eigenvalues .",
    "we use the publicly available chebfun - matlab package @xcite ( with the appropriate modification for the present purpose ) to perform the numerical computations for the eigenvalue system described in the previous section .",
    "exploration of visco - resistive mhd stability using chebyshev polynomials is nothing new however ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . using the example given on - line , based on orr - sommerfeld operator",
    ", we form the eigensystem for the magnetized version of coupled orr - sommerfeld and squire equations including the effect of rotation , for the present computation purpose . note that beyond a certain number of eigenvalues and ,",
    "hence , the matrix dimension ( @xmath84 , depending on the value of @xmath26 ) , the cholesky - decomposition of @xmath85 for the purposes of calculating the 2-norm can not be done because the determinant of the matrix @xmath79 does not remain positive definite on using the chebfun package , which poses problem to compute teg . however , once such a situation arises , the code truncates the number of eigenvalues and , hence , the matrix dimension to assure the determinant of @xmath79 to be positive .",
    "the last few eigenvalues , in our analyses , however , do not seem to make any practical difference in computing the value of teg . although chebfun software is probably not best suited for accuracy purposes , for the present purpose this does not pose much hindrance where the aim is to qualitatively understand the effects of nonnormality in shearing mhd flows ( see @xcite to understand the requirement of better linear algebra software which could handle up to thousands of modes ) .",
    "before we discuss the numerical results in detail , here we try to understand some fundamental properties of perturbation based on simpler approximate analytical solutions . note that due to the assumption of incompressibility , the fast magneto - acoustic modes ( and its modifications ) have already been eliminated and we are left with the slow modes which are degenerate with the alfvn modes .",
    "see @xcite for the detailed description of magneto - acoustic modes . in brief , the magneto - acoustic modes are generated in mhd flows under perturbation , which are four in number including forward going and backward going modes .",
    "for ease of understanding , let us consider the simpler plane wave perturbations , of form @xmath86 $ ] , unlike the more generalized choice as given in eq .",
    "( [ qsol ] ) , which indeed will be used in subsequent sections .",
    "the corresponding dispersion relation can be obtained by substituting the above plane wave perturbation into eq .",

    "the choice of plane wave perturbation allows us to substitute @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "we now define alfvn frequency @xmath94 , where alfvn velocity @xmath95 ( as per our choice of dimension , mentioned in ",
    "ii.a ) , and @xmath96 , and eq .",
    "( [ spectral ] ) reduces to @xmath97    from the above equation , we easily see that on taking the axisymmetric ( @xmath98 ) ideal mhd ( @xmath99 ) for plane couette ( @xmath100 ) flow , we recover the alfvn modes , which manifest in the eigenspectra as symmetric modes on the real axis in complex plane ( see the eigenspectra in subsequent sections ) , provided magnetic field is not insignificant . as @xmath101 here",
    "is chosen real , all the modes are stable , which is indeed the case for plane couette flow .",
    "the inclusion of rotation ( finite @xmath26 ) gives rise to two additional sets of solutions , which can be interpreted as modified alfvn modes that results in stable and unstable modes , where part of them are overlapping along the @xmath48-axis ( see , e.g. , top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ kz15 ] below ) .",
    "if we consider visco - resistive effects ( finite @xmath2 and @xmath102 ) , we see that the spectra shift down in the complex plane because of an additional negative imaginary term @xmath103 , which decreases in magnitude on increasing @xmath2 : see fig .",
    "[ eigcom ] .",
    "finally , considering the non - axisymmetric case ( @xmath104 ) causes the inclusion of the coordinate dependent shear term arising due to background flow ( nonzero @xmath105 ) , which causes forward and backward doppler shifting of the present modes @xcite .",
    "this shows up in the eigenspectra as splitting of the vertical branches ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ ky15 ] below ) , a very characteristic feature of rotating shear flows in general ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "note also that as @xmath106 , the various branches tend to overlap due to decreasing rotational effect and modes tend to become degenerate , as is clear from eq .",
    "( [ planespectral ] ) .",
    "see the evolution of eigenspectra with the change in @xmath107 shown below .",
    "we consider the following cases :    * keplerian disk , i.e. , @xmath108 , * constant angular momentum flow , i.e. , @xmath28 , * plane couette flow , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "chandrasekhar @xcite already explored the regimes of instability in mhd taylor - couette flow for a variety of cases which follows a slightly different formulation than ours .",
    "we consider the general non - axisymmetric case and , on fixing the values of @xmath2 and @xmath102 ( with @xmath109 for ease of analysis and also because their magnitudes , in main applications under consideration , are roughly the same ) , obtain an approximate regime of instability in the @xmath110 parameter space .",
    "we further choose , @xmath111 ( for satisfying the original unperturbed equation ) and @xmath112 ( because that does not pose hindrance on any new physics ) .",
    "the unstable solutions , however , do not exist for plane couette flow discussed below .    the various contours in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] show the regions of instability as functions of @xmath113 and @xmath114 . at very low @xmath114",
    ", there are practically no unstable flows . however , at e.g @xmath108 , for @xmath115 , at a low value of @xmath116 , the flow starts to exhibit unstable behaviour due to mri .",
    "the value of @xmath116 leading to instability continues to increase with increasing @xmath114 till a critical value of @xmath114 , above which , again , there is no instability .",
    "this feature is consistent across both the cases of @xmath2 considered and with the two different types of flow considered as well .",
    "moreover , above a certain value of @xmath107 ( e.g. @xmath117 for @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) , the unstable region vanishes again .",
    "the order of magnitude of most of the unstable ( positive @xmath120 ) eigenvalues ranges as @xmath121 .",
    "hence , on comparing this range with the values of @xmath122 , obtained from the range of @xmath113 and @xmath114 giving rise to instability , one finds that their orders of magnitude match and , hence , they correspond to mri ( indeed the best mri growth rate corresponds to @xmath123 @xcite ) .",
    "note that the contours are only rough boundaries and , hence , their jagged appearance .",
    "thus , they illustrate the behaviors exhibited approximately .      in the case of stable solutions surrounding the unstable zone shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , certain trends are noticed in teg as well as the eigenspectra . for evaluating the variance of energy growth with changing wavenumber from its value corresponding to unstable region , for given values of @xmath124 and @xmath125 , we fix one of the components of wavenumber and vary the other component .",

    "consequently , one can see from the growth curves that the peak teg decreases regularly , from a maximum of about @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "note that the amplitude of teg is directly correlated with the number of slowly - decaying low - frequency modes , which may allow an optimal linear combination over sufficient timescales to exhibit substantial teg .    in the case of fixed @xmath107 ( fig .",

    "figure [ qinfeigs ] shows that on increasing @xmath116 from @xmath32 onwards , when the magnetic field is weaker ( @xmath122 is smaller ) , the eigenspectrum splits from a shape of single vertical branch to y - shaped spectra due to emergence of doppler shifted modes .",

    "the incorporation of visco - resistive effects   ( by having a finite @xmath2 and/or @xmath102 ) and non - axisymmetry ( non - zero azimuthal   wavenumber @xmath116 ) result in a variety of modes ( modifications of the basic alfvn   modes ) , which manifest physically as lesser number of unstable modes as well as lowered teg .",
    "it seems that , in the case of stable systems , the amplitude of teg is directly correlated   with the number of slowly - decaying low - frequency modes , since these are the modes that may   allow an optimal linear combination over sufficient timescales to exhibit substantial teg .",
    "perturbations with non - axisymmetric component ( non - zero @xmath116 ) tend to get sheared by   the flow , resulting in high - frequency doppler - shifted oscillatory modes .",
    "these modes have a   lower possibility of optimal linear combinations and , hence , do not show significant teg . since the flows under consideration have plane ( and linear ) shear , axisymmetric perturbations therein remain unaffected  and exhibit instability or substantial teg .",
    "we posit that high frequency oscillations do not allow the modes to have optimal linear combination over a given time range , which is necessary for large teg .",
    "perturbations with vertical component are   affected by both rotation ( leading to non - zero vorticity ; essential for turbulence ) and the   background magnetic field strength .",
    "a certain finite range of these perturbations allows for   instability and significant teg .",
    "this range ( which is also dependent on the value of background magnetic field ) specifies where mri and where significant teg can occur . beyond this range ( above certain value of vertical wavenumber @xmath107 for a given magnetic field ) , the magnetic field stabilizes the flow and in the absence of vertical perturbation the flow becomes irrotational .   in either of the cases ,",
    "instability is reduced ( having less number of unstable modes with lower growth rates ) as well as teg is decreased .",
    "last , strong background magnetic fields tend to   have a stabilizing effect on the perturbations , which can be understood by invoking the   `` rod''-like nature of these fields , compared to the  spring \"- like nature of weak fields governing mri . what is more interesting to note is that   these strong fields also kill off teg .",
    "the type of modes that we consider is limited by the assumption of incompressibility , the shearing box model ( which ignores the effects of curvature ) and plane wave perturbation in the azimuthal and vertical directions .",
    "a lot of work , which includes some of these consideration , but limited to the scope of linear stability analysis , is already present in literature @xcite .",
    "a more complete picture of mhd teg may emerge with the study of compressible flows in cylindrical coordinates with more generalised perturbations .",

    "<S> the emergence of turbulence in shear flows is a well - investigated field . yet </S>",
    "<S> , there are some lingering issues that have not been sufficiently resolved . </S>",
    "<S> one of them is the apparent contradiction between the results of linear stability analysis quoting a flow to be stable and experiments and simulations proving it to be otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> there is some success , in particular in astrophysical systems , based on magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) , revealing turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> however , mri requires the system to be weakly magnetized . </S>",
    "<S> such instability is neither a feature of general magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) flows nor revealed in purely hydrodynamic flows </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless , linear perturbations of such flows are nonnormal in nature which argues for a possible origin of nonlinearity therein . </S>",
    "<S> the concept behind this is that nonnormal perturbations could produce huge transient energy growth ( teg ) , which may lead to non - linearity and further turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> however , so far , nonnormal effects in shear flows have not been explored much in the presence of magnetic fields . in this spirit , here we consider the perturbed visco - resistive mhd shear flows with rotation in general . </S>",
    "<S> basically we recast the magnetized momentum balance and associated equations into the magnetized version of orr - sommerfeld and squire equations and their magnetic analogues . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume the flow to be incompressible and in the presence of coriolis effect solve the equations using a pseudospectral eigenvalue approach . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the possible emergence of instability and large teg in three different types of flows , namely , the keplerian flow , the taylor - couette ( or constant angular momentum ) flow and plane couette flow . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , above a certain value of magnetic field , instability and teg both stop occurring . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that teg is maximum in the vicinity of regions of instability in the wave number space for a given magnetic field and reynolds number , leading to nonlinearity and plausible turbulence . rotating shear flows are ubiquitous in astrophysics , especially accretion disks , where molecular viscosity is too low to account for observed data . </S>",
    "<S> the primary accepted cause of energy - momentum transport therein is turbulent viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> hence , these results would have important implications in astrophysics . </S>"
