    "in this paper , we consider the problem of the reconstruction of the refractive indices ( equivalently , the relative permittivities , or dielectric constants ) of unknown targets placed in a homogeneous medium using experimental measurements of back - scattered electromagnetic waves in time domain .",
    "mathematical speaking , this is a coefficient inverse problem ( cip ) for the time - dependent wave - like equation : we reconstruct a spatially varying coefficient of this equation using measurements on a part of the boundary of the domain of interest .",
    "potential applications of this problem are in the detection and characterization of explosives , including improvised explosive devices ( ieds ) . note that ieds are often located above the ground surface @xcite , which is somewhat close to our case of targets located in the air .",
    "the case when targets are buried in the ground will be reported in a future publication .",
    "different imaging methods have been applied to this type of measurements to obtain geometrical information such as shapes , sizes and locations of the targets , see e.g.  @xcite",
    ". however , the refractive indices , which characterize the targets in terms of their constituent materials , are much more difficult to estimate .",
    "this is a motivation of the current publication .    for conventional gradient - based optimization approaches",
    ", there is a huge literature , see e.g.  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "it is well - known that their convergence is guaranteed only if the starting point of iterations is chosen to be sufficiently close to the correct solution .",
    "this means that they require some _ a priori _ information about the targets being found , which is not always available in many practical situations . unlike these",
    ", a different method was proposed in @xcite and results were summarized in the book @xcite .",
    "this method provides a good approximation for the exact coefficient without _ a priori _ knowledge of a small neighborhood of this coefficient .",
    "its global convergence has been rigorously proved for an approximate mathematical model , see theorem 2.9.4 in @xcite and theorem 5.1 in @xcite . due to this model ,",
    "it is referred to as an _ approximately globally convergent method _ ( globally convergent method in short ) . in @xcite",
    "the authors demonstrated good reconstruction results for a transmitted experimental data set using this method , whereas a gradient based method with tikhonov regularization , starting from the homogeneous medium as the first guess , failed .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show how this globally convergent method performs on a backscattering experimental data .",
    "while previously it was demonstrated how this method works on transmitted real data b - k:2012,b - k : ip2010,k - f - b - p - s : ip2010 , the case of backscattering data is much more complicated , because backscattered signals are much weaker than transmitted ones .",
    "in addition , a number of unwanted scattering signals caused by objects present in the room of experiments  ( e.g. furniture ) occur in the backscattering case .",
    "although in @xcite backscattering data were treated , they were 1-d data only , while we work here with the 3-d data . to collect these data ,",
    "an experimental apparatus was built in the microwave laboratory of university of north carolina at charlotte , using support of us army research office .",
    "the main challenge working with our experimental data is a _ huge misfit _ between these data and computationally simulated ones , also see b - k:2012,b - k : ip2010,k - f - b - p - s : ip2010,k - b - k - s - n - f : ip2012 for the same conclusion . from the functional analysis standpoint",
    "this means that the function expressing experimental data is far away in any reasonable norm from the range of the operator of our forward problem . and",
    "this operator should be inverted to solve the inverse problem .",
    "hence , any inversion algorithm would fail to produce satisfactory results , if being applied to the raw data .",
    "therefore , the _ central procedure _ before applying",
    "the globally convergent algorithm is a heuristic data pre - processing procedure .",
    "this procedure makes the data look somewhat similar to the data provided by computational simulations . in other words",
    ", it moves the data closer to the range of that operator .",
    "the pre - processing of the current paper is substantially different from pre - processing procedures of b - k:2012,b - k :",
    "ip2010,k - f - b - p - s : ip2010,k - b - k - s - n - f : ip2012 because the data are different .",
    "we describe our data pre - processing procedure in section sec : exp .",
    "the pre - processed data are used as the input for the globally convergent method .",
    "our goal is to image refractive indices and locations of the targets .",
    "in addition , we want to estimate sizes of those targets .",
    "we should mention that results of this method can be used as initial guesses for locally convergent methods in order to refine images , especially the targets shapes .",
    "for example , it was shown in @xcite that the adaptive finite element method has significantly improved images of shapes for transmitted experimental data in the case when its starting point was the solution obtained by the globally convergent method .",
    "the experimental data sets of this paper include both non - blind and blind cases .",
    "blind \" means that the targets were unknown for the computational team ( ntt , lb , mvk ) but known to maf , who was leading the data collection process .",
    "moreover , refractive indices of these targets were measured after the reconstruction results were obtained .",
    "then computational results were compared with directly measured ones .",
    "our results indicate that we not only reconstruct accurately refractive indices and locations of targets , but also can differentiate between metallic and non - metallic targets .",
    "in this section we state the forward and inverse problems under consideration as well briefly outline the globally convergent method of b - k:2012 for reader s convenience .",
    "we refer to @xcite and b - k : jiip2012 for more details .      as the forward problem",
    ", we consider the propagation of the electromagnetic wave generated by a point source in @xmath0 .",
    "below , @xmath1 denotes a point in @xmath0 .",
    "since in our experiments only one component of the electric wave field @xmath2 is generated from the transmitting horn antenna ( source ) and the detector measures only that component of the scattered electric field , we model the wave propagation by the following cauchy problem for the scalar wave equation @xmath3where @xmath4 is the total wave which is equal to the sum of the incident wave @xmath5 and the scattered wave @xmath6 caused by the scattering from the inhomogeneous medium . to further justify our use of the single equation ( eq : fp1 ) instead of the full maxwell system , we refer to beilina : cejm2013 , where it was shown numerically that the component of @xmath2 which was initially incident upon the medium , dominates two other components , at least for a rather simple medium , such as we work with , see section 7.2.2 of @xcite .",
    "besides , equation ( [ eq : fp1 ] ) was previously successfully used to work with transmitted experimental data @xcite . in ( [ eq : fp1 ] ) , @xmath7 represents the spatially distributed dielectric constant , while @xmath8 is referred to as the refractive index of the medium in which the wave propagates . in our analysis , we assume that the coefficient @xmath7 is unknown inside of a bounded convex domain @xmath9 with @xmath10 we also assume the existence of a positive constant @xmath11 such that @xmath12,\\ \\forall \\mathbf{x}\\in \\br^{3},\\ \\epsilon ( \\mathbf{x})\\equiv 1,\\ \\forall \\mathbf{x}\\notin \\omega .",

    "we also assume that the source is placed outside of @xmath13 , i.e.  @xmath15 .    for the convenience of the theoretical analysis",
    ", we state the inverse problem for the case when the data at the entire boundary are given .",

    "_ @xmath20    the function @xmath21 represents the time dependent measured data at the boundary of the domain of interest .",
    "the assumption of the infinite time interval in ( [ eq : mea ] ) is not a restrictive one , because in our method we apply the laplace transform to @xmath21 with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "since the kernel of this transform decays exponentially with respect to @xmath22 , then the laplace transform effectively cuts off to zero values of the function @xmath21 for @xmath23 larger than some value @xmath24 .    concerning the uniqueness of this cip , global uniqueness theorems for multidimensional cips with a single measurement",
    "are currently known only under the assumption that at least one of initial conditions does not equal zero in the entire domain @xmath25 .",
    "all these theorems were proven by the method , which was originated in @xcite ; also , see , e.g. sections 1.10 , 1.11 in @xcite about this method . this technique is based on carleman estimates .",
    "since both initial conditions ( [ eq : fp2 ] ) equal zero in @xmath26 then this method is inapplicable to our case .",
    "however , since we need to solve numerically our cip anyway , we assume that uniqueness takes place .",
    "we remark that equation ( [ eq : fp1 ] ) is invalid if metallic objects are present in the domain @xmath13 . to deal with this type of targets ,",
    "we follow the suggestion of @xcite .",
    "it was established numerically in @xcite that metals can be modeled as dielectrics with a high dielectric constant , which is referred to as the appearing  dielectric constant of metals .",

    "therefore , we say that the algorithm is globally convergent within the framework of the approximation ( [ eq : model2 ] ) .    in our computations ,",
    "the bound constraints ( [ eq : fp3 ] ) is used to truncate the coefficient @xmath114 on each iteration .",

    "we choose @xmath117 as the prism @xmath118we denote by @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "an incident plane wave of a short time period is excited at @xmath122 and propagates in the negative @xmath123 direction . at the plane @xmath124",
    "we assume that the absorbing boundary condition is satisfied , and at @xmath125 we assign the homogeneous neumann boundary condition .",
    "more precisely , we solve the following problem @xmath126where @xmath127 is the outward normal vector of @xmath128 and @xmath129 is the duration of the excitation of the incident plane wave .",
    "function @xmath130 is the incident waveform chosen by @xmath131here @xmath132 represents the angular frequency of the incident plane wave .",
    "the forward problem ( [ eq : fp01])([eq : fp07 ] ) is solved using the software package waves @xcite via the hybrid fem / fdm method described in @xcite .",
    "our experimental configuration is shown in figure  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "the setup of our measurements included a horn antenna ( transmitter ) fixed at a given position and a detector scanned in a square of a vertical plane , which we refer to as the measurement plane .",
    "consider the cartesian coordinate system @xmath133 as shown in figure [ fig : setup](b ) .",
    "the scanning area was 1 m by 1 m with the step size of 0.02 m , starting at @xmath134 , and ends at @xmath135 .    in our model ( [ eq : fp1])([eq : fp2 ] ) , we assumed that the source point @xmath136 is in @xmath137 .",
    "however , due to some technical difficulties with the mechanical scanning system , the horn antenna was not placed behind but in front of the measurement plane ( between the measurement plane and the targets ) .",
    "therefore a small area in the center of the scanning area on the measurement plane was shaded by the horn .",
    "the horn was placed at the distance of about 0.2 - 0.25 m from the measurement plane and the distances from the targets to the measurement plane are about 0.8 m.    at each position of the detector , a number of electric pulses were emitted by the horn .",
    "the detector received two types of signals : the direct signals from the source and the backscattered signals by the targets .",
    "the direct signals are used for time reference in data pre - processing .",
    "there were also other unwanted signals due to scattering by some objects in the room . to reduce the instability of the recorded signals in terms of magnitude",
    ", the measurements were repeated 800 times at each detector position and the recorded signals were averaged . by scanning the detector and repeating the measurements , we obtained essentially the same signals as using one incident signal and multiple detectors at the same time .",
    "pulses were generated by the picosecond pulse generator 10070a .",
    "the scattered signals were measured by a tektronix dsa70000 series real - time oscilloscope .",
    "the emitted pulses were of 300 picoseconds duration .",
    "the wavelength of the incident pulses was about 0.03 m. the sampling rate ( the step size in time between two consecutive records of captured signals ) was @xmath138 picoseconds .",
    "each signal was recorded for 10 nanoseconds .",
    "one of the biggest challenges in working with these experimental data is to deal with the _ huge misfit _ between these data and the data produced via computational simulations , also see b - k:2012,b - k : ip2010,k - f - b - p - s : ip2010,k - b - k - s - n - f : ip2012 for the same conclusion .",
    "there are several causes of this misfit such as ( i ) the instability of the amplitude of the emitted signals ( incident waves ) which causes the instability of the received signals , ( ii ) unwanted scattered waves by several existing objects around our devices ( see figure  fig : prep02(a ) ) , ( iii ) the shadow on the measurement plane caused by the transmitting horn antenna , and ( iv ) the difference between the experimental and simulated incident waves .",
    "figure [ fig : prep1 ] compares the laplace transform of an experimental scattered wave and the corresponding simulated one , which shows a huge misfit between them .",
    "note that the laplace transform of the experimental wave was carried out after removing the incident wave and unwanted parts , as shown in figure [ fig : prep02](c ) .",
    "therefore , the _ central procedure _ before applying inversion methods is the data pre - processing .",
    "this procedure is usually heuristic and can not be rigorously justified .",
    "our data pre - processing consists of six steps described below .",
    "we do not describe steps 1 - 3 in detail here , since they are straightforward .",
    "off - set correction_. the acquired signals are usually shifted from the zero mean value .",
    "this can be corrected by subtracting the mean value from them .",
    "time - zero correction_. time - zero refers to the moment at which the signal is emitted from the transmitter .",
    "the recorded signals may be shifted in time .",
    "we use the direct signals from the transmitter to the detector to correct the time - zero .",
    "source shift_. as mentioned above , the horn antenna in our experiments is placed between the targets and the measurement plane . however , in data calibration , we need to simulate the data for the case when the measurement plane is between the horn and the targets .",
    "therefore , we artificially shift  the horn in the positive @xmath139direction such that it is 0.4 m further than the measurement plane from the targets .",
    "it is done by shifting the whole time - dependent data by a number of samples which corresponds to the shifted distance .",
    "extraction of scattered signals_. apart from the signals backscattered by the targets , our measured data also contain various types of signals as mentioned above . what we need , however , is the scattered signals by the targets only .",
    "the extraction of these scattered signals for each target is done as follows .",
    "first , we exclude the direct signals and the unwanted signals , which come earlier than the scattered signals by the target ( see figure [ fig : prep02](a)-(b ) ) , by calculating the time of arrival .",
    "these unwanted signals are due to the reflection of the direct signals by the metallic structure behind the measurement plane , so we can estimate their times of arrival as we know the distance from the measurement plane to this structure . then , as we observed that the scattered signals by the target are the strongest peaks of the remaining , we first detect , for each detector position , the strongest negative peak after removing the aforementioned signals .",
    "then , the scattered signals by the target are taken as 7 peaks ( 4 negative peaks and 3 positive peaks ) starting from the first negative peak prior to the strongest one , if its amplitude is less than 80% of the strongest one ( see figure [ fig : prep02](a ) ) . otherwise , we start from the second negative peak prior to the strongest one .",
    "the reason for choosing 7 peaks for the scattered signals is due to the fact that the incident pulses also contain 7 strong peaks .",
    "we note that having the scattered signals by the target , we can easily determine the distance from its front side to the measurement plane by calculating the time of arrival .",
    "data propagation_. after getting the scattered signals , the next step of data pre - processing is to propagate the data closer to the targets , i.e.  to approximate the scattered waves on a plane closer to the targets , compared to the measurement plane .",
    "there are two reasons for doing this .",
    "the first one is that since the laplace transform decays exponentially in terms of the time delay , which is proportional to the distance from the targets to the measurement plane , then the amplitude of the data after the laplace transform on the measurement plane is very small and can be dominated by the computational error .",
    "the second reason is that this propagation procedure helps to reduce the computational cost substantially as the computational domain @xmath13 is reduced .",
    "we have also observed that the data propagation helps to reduce the noise in the measured data .",
    "data calibration_. finally , since the amplitude of the experimental incident and scattered waves are usually quite different from simulations , we need to bring the former to the same level of the amplitude as the latter .",
    "this is done using a known target referred to as _",
    "calibrating object_.    figure [ fig : prep02 ] shows an original data set and data after steps 1 - 4 for a horizontal scan of the detector .",
    "one can see that steps 1 - 4 help to remove the unwanted signals . in the following , we present our methods for steps 5 and 6 .",
    "denote by @xmath140 the measurement plane and by @xmath141 the propagation plane , which is closer to the targets than @xmath140 . without a loss of the generality , we denote by @xmath142 and @xmath143 , where the number @xmath144 moreover , denote by @xmath145 the scanning area of the detector on the plane @xmath140 .",
    "let @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath148 the scattered wave .",
    "note that the medium between @xmath140 and @xmath141 is homogeneous with @xmath149 and the scattered wave @xmath6 propagates in the direction from @xmath141 to @xmath140 .",
    "the aim of the data propagation is to approximate @xmath150 from the measured data @xmath151 .    to do this",
    ", we make use of a time reversal method .",
    "its idea is to reverse the scattered wave in time via solution of an initial boundary value problem for the time - reversed wave function .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "since short pulses are used as incident waves , it is reasonable to assume that the scattered wave @xmath6 in the domain between @xmath140 and @xmath141 vanishes along with its time derivative @xmath152 after some time @xmath24 .",
    "therefore in the following we only consider the finite time interval @xmath153 .",
    ". then the time - reversed wave function @xmath155 satisfies the homogeneous wave equation .",
    "moreover , it propagates in the negative @xmath123 direction , i.e.  from @xmath140 to @xmath141 . to find @xmath156",
    ", we consider the domain @xmath157 with @xmath158 .",
    "note that @xmath159 the reason for choosing this larger domain is that we need to assign boundary conditions at @xmath160 .",
    "indeed , we assume that @xmath161 satisfies the absorbing boundary condition at @xmath162 .",
    "on @xmath163 far from our propagation plane , this boundary condition means , heuristically , that we send back \" the original scattered wave @xmath6 recorded at @xmath140 . on the other hand",
    ", we impose the zero neumann boundary condition at the rest of the boundary of @xmath164 , except of @xmath165 .",
    "denote @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "we obtain the following problem for the function @xmath168 @xmath169a similar procedure was proposed and numerically implemented for computationally simulated data in @xcite .",
    "however , the absorbing boundary condition for the original scattered wave @xmath6 was applied in @xcite . since our time - reversed wave function @xmath161 propagates from @xmath165 to @xmath170 ,",
    "we believe that it is more natural to apply the absorbing boundary condition on @xmath171 to @xmath161 .",
    "note that we do not locate scatterers here , since we know from our previous pre - processing steps an approximate distance to the targets .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein for experimental time reversal mirror method , a similar procedure but using a physical mirror to reverse the received signals in time and send back to the targets .",

    "we do not prove this theorem here due to the space limit .",
    "this theorem can be extended to more general domains .",
    "we note that its proof is similar with the proof of theorem 4.1 of beilina : cejm2013 for the maxwell s system . for brevity",

    "we have observed that two different calibration factors should be used for these two types of targets , because the signals from them have different levels of amplitude .",
    "first of all , we differentiated these two types of targets by comparing the amplitudes of the recorded signals .",
    "indeed , we have consistently observed that the maximal values of amplitudes of measured signals are at least two times larger for metallic targets than for dielectric ones on those positions of detectors which are most sensitive to the presence of targets .",
    "next , we chose in each type a known object as the calibrating object .",
    "in other words , we should use a dielectric calibrating object for all dielectric targets and another metal calibrating object for all metallic targets .",
    "the value of @xmath195 for the dielectric calibrating object was taken as @xmath196 inside that target and @xmath197 outside of it .",

    "four of them ( targets 1 - 4 ) were non - blind and six of them ( targets 5 - 10 ) were blind . in our data pre - processing , we chose target 1 ( a piece of wood ) and target 3 ( a metallic sphere ) as our calibrating objects .",
    "the spatial dimensions in our experiment were given in meters .",
    "since the scanning step in our measured data was @xmath200 m in both @xmath201 and @xmath202 directions , we chose the dimensionless spatial variable @xmath203 to be @xmath204 .",

    "we use @xmath209 and @xmath23 again to denote the dimensionless variables .      before applying the inversion algorithm , some information about the targets was in place already from the measured data due to the data pre - processing .",

    "second , by the data propagation , the targets locations in the @xmath210 plane were estimated .",
    "thirdly , we also differentiated between nonmetallic and metallic targets directly from the measured data based on signal amplitudes .",
    "given the estimated distances from the targets to the measurement plane , which were about @xmath211 m , we propagated the measured data from the measurement plane @xmath212 to the plane @xmath213 .",
    "this means that the distance from the front sides of the targets to the backscattering boundary of our inversion domain was about 0.04 m. the reason for choosing this distance was due to good reconstruction results we have obtained for several non - blind targets .",
    "the domain @xmath13 was chosen by @xmath214for solving the forward problem ( [ eq : fp01])([eq : fp07 ] ) , using the hybrid fdm / fem method , we chose the domain @xmath117 as @xmath215this domain @xmath117 was decomposed into two subdomain : @xmath216 .",

    "the reason for using the fem mesh in @xmath13 is that it is possible to refine the reconstruction using adaptive mesh refinement .",

    "note that the function @xmath227 has a negative peak corresponding to each target , see figure [ fig : prep2 ] .",
    "the truncation value 0.85 was chosen based on trial - and - error tests on some non - blind targets with known sizes .",

    ", we applied the linear interpolation to the laplace transform of the propagated measured data .",
    "below we present the reconstruction results of two different tests : * test 1 * and * test 2*. in test 1 , we made use of the first tail function computed from the boundary value problem ( [ 3.37])([3.38 ] ) . as it was remarked in section [ sec : gc ] , the global convergence with this choice of the initial tail function is rigorously guaranteed . in test 2 , we choose the first tail function from some information about the targets which we obtained in the data pre - processing .",
    "although the convergence of the resulting algorithm has not been rigorously proved yet , our numerical results show good reconstructions . as we mentioned in section [ subsec :",
    "alg ] , stopping criteria of the algorithm should be addressed numerically .",

    "let @xmath250 be the number of the iteration @xmath71 at which the minimum of the first norms is achieved , e.g. @xmath251 in figure [ fig : result0](a ) .",
    "as the reconstructed coefficient @xmath252 , we first choose @xmath253 next , if @xmath254 or @xmath255 , then we take the function @xmath252 as the final reconstruction .",
    "suppose now that @xmath256 then we consider the iteration number @xmath257 at which the smallest local minimum of the final norm @xmath249 is achieved , e.g. @xmath258 in figure [ fig : result0](a ) .",
    "then we take the function @xmath259 as the final reconstruction .",
    "as shown in table [ table1 ] , the reconstructed refractive indices are quite close to the true values for all dielectric targets .",
    "table [ table2 ] shows that reconstructed appearing dielectric constants of metallic targets are always in the required range ( [ x ] ) .",
    "however , the shapes and sizes of the targets were not well reconstructed , in particular the depth \" in the @xmath139direction .",
    "to improve this , we use the following post - processing procedure .",
    "let @xmath260 be the plane where the function @xmath252 achieves its maximal value .",

    "finally , we approximate the depth in the @xmath123 direction by truncating @xmath261 by 90% of its maximal value . this truncation value is chosen based on the trial - and - error tests with non - blind targets .",
    "figure [ fig : result1 ] shows imaging results for targets 4 and 10 .      in this test , we chose the mesh size of @xmath219 by @xmath219 by @xmath219 in order to represent the targets shapes more accurately .",

    "moreover , this domain should contain the unknown target we are looking for .",

    "however , we also set the maximum number of inner iterations to be 5 .",
    "that means , the inner iterations were stopped if either ( [ 7.5 ] ) or ( [ 7.5_1 ] ) was satisfied for @xmath280 or if @xmath281 .    concerning the outer iterations ,",
    "we have observed that the error @xmath249 decreased with respect to @xmath71 first , and then increased after reaching a minimum , see figure [ fig : result0](b ) . at that minimum ,",
    "the estimated coefficient was a good approximation of the true one for some non - blind targets .",
