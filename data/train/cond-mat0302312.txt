    "@xcite however , if the transition dipoles are also affected by disorder , a proper modification of the theory is required .",

    "@xcite for completeness , let us outline the important facts concerning analyticity and accuracy of the beb cpa .",

    "it follows also that using beb cpa one gets an exact value of the absorption linewidth , _ provided _ the latter is defined from the weighted second centered moment of the spectral density [ @xmath89 .",
    "this means that , even though there exists no unique way to define the width of an inhomogeneously - broadened absorption line , the beb cpa still gives a reasonable estimate for this characteristics of the spectrum .",
    "let us also mention that the theory does not seem to violate the fundamental inequalities @xmath90 to be fulfilled for every eigenvalue @xmath19 .",
    "these , in particular , impose the lower , @xmath91 , and the upper , @xmath92 , bounds of the spectral region , where minimum and maximum are taken over all disorder realizations .",

    "to establish connection with the coherence length defined above it is sufficient to notice that only a single pair of poles will contribute to the asymptotics ( [ ncohdef ] ) , namely , having minimal distance from the real axis @xmath99 .",
