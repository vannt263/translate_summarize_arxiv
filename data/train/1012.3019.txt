    "the observed @xmath0cephei and spb stars . [ cols=\">,^,^,^ \" , ]     the determination of the fundamental parameters and the description of the pulsating properties of all studied stars were presented by @xcite ( @xcite , tables  1a , 1b , and 4 ) .",
    "the most simple modeling of the magnetic field geometry is based on the assumption that the studied stars are oblique dipole rotators , i.e.  their magnetic field can be approximated by a dipole with the magnetic axis inclined to the rotation axis .",
    "the magnetic dipole axis tilt @xmath0 is constrained by    @xmath1    so that the obliquity angle @xmath0 is given by    @xmath2 .",
    "\\label{eqn:4}\\ ] ]    in table  [ tab : dipvals ] we show for each star with detected periodicity in rows 2 and 3 the mean value @xmath3 and the amplitude of the field variation @xmath4 . in row  4",
    "we present @xmath5 values published recently by @xcite for @xmath6cma and 15cma and from @xcite for @xmath7pyx and 33eri .",
    "the radius values in row  5 were taken from @xcite .",
    "the radius of 15cma ( @xmath8=10.0@xmath91.5r@xmath10 ) was derived in the same way as in @xcite by adopting the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 from @xcite . in the last four rows we list the @xmath13 and the parameters of the magnetic field dipole models .",
    "the polar field strength @xmath14 in the last row was calculated following @xcite using limb darkening parameters from @xcite .",
    "using fors1/2 and sofin longitudinal magnetic field measurements collected in our recent studies , we were able to determine rotation periods and constrain the field geometry of two @xmath0cephei stars , one candidate @xmath0cephei star , and one spb star .",
    "the dipole model provides a satisfactory fit to the data and among the very few presently known magnetic @xmath0cephei stars , @xmath6cma and @xmath7pyx possess the largest magnetic fields , with a dipole strength of several kg .",
    "@xcite discussed the position of spb and chemically peculiar bp stars in the h - r diagram . indicating that the group of bp stars is significantly younger than the group of spb stars .",
    "a similar conclusion was deduced by @xcite , who studied the evolution of magnetic fields in ap and bp stars with definitely determined magnetic field geometries across the main sequence .",
    "the vast majority of bp stars exhibits a smooth , single - wave variation of the longitudinal magnetic field during the stellar rotation cycle .",
    "these observations are considered as evidence for a dominant dipolar contribution to the magnetic field topology .",
    "it is of interest that the study of @xcite indicates the prevalence of larger obliquities @xmath0 , namely @xmath0@xmath1560@xmath16 , in more massive stars .",
    "the magnetic field models for the three @xmath0cephei stars and the one spb star presented in this work confirm this trend .",
    "the insufficient knowledge of the strength , geometry , and time variability of magnetic fields in hot pulsating stars prevented until now important theoretical studies on the impact of magnetic fields on stellar rotation , pulsations , and element diffusion .",
    "although it is expected that the magnetic field can distort the frequency patterns ( e.g.  @xcite ) , such a perturbation is not yet detected in hot pulsating stars .",
    "splitting of non - radial pulsation modes was observed for 15cma @xcite , but the identification of these modes is still pending .",
    "the magnetic @xmath0cephei star sample indicates that they all share common properties : they are n - rich targets ( e.g. , @xcite ) and , as discussed by @xcite , their pulsations are dominated by a non - linear dominant radial mode ( see also @xcite for @xmath6cma ) .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field might consequently play an important role to explain such a distinct behaviour of magnetic @xmath0cephei stars .",
    "more precisely , chemical abundance anomalies are commonly believed to be due to radiatively - driven microscopic diffusion in stars rotating sufficiently slowly to allow such a process to be effective .",
    "however , we need an additional clue to account for the fact that both normal and nitrogen - enriched slowly rotating stars are observed .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field is a very plausible explanation , as it can add to the stability of the atmosphere , allowing diffusion processes to occur @xcite . on the other hand , among the studied stars ,",
    "apart from the star 15cma with rather low @xmath17kms@xmath18 , the other three magnetic pulsating stars rotate much faster up to @xmath19kms@xmath18 for @xmath6cma with the strongest magnetic field , indicating that these stars are not truly slowly rotating stars , but seen close to pole - on .",
    "obviously , the topic of mixing signatures is not understood theoretically yet and more computational work as well as future additional observational validation of our results are needed to understand the link between the presence of a magnetic field , rotation , pulsating characteristics , and abundance peculiarities ."
