    "since the discovery of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows in the late 90 s  @xcite , these energetic phenomena have been targets of observational efforts at essentially all electromagnetic wavelengths .",
    "the wealth of available information put severe constraints on the various families of interpretative scenarios , showing an unexpected richness and complexity of possible behaviors  @xcite .",
    "the first observations at mev - gev energies , with the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on - board the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro )  @xcite , showed that the observations in the high energy ( he : 1 mev-30 gev ) and in the very high energy range ( vhe : 30 gev - 30 tev ) can be powerful diagnostic tools for the emission processes and physical conditions of grbs . the launch of _ fermi _",
    "@xcite , with its large area telescope ( lat )  @xcite , showed that , at least for the brightest events , gev emission from grbs is a relatively common phenomenon  @xcite confirming that our comprehension of grb physics is still unsatisfactory . in this context",
    ", multiple efforts have been performed in grbs observations by the new generation of ground - based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) , such as magic , hess or veritas . in all cases",
    "only upper limits have been derived .",
    "the two most limiting factors are the heavily attenuation of the vhe signal by pair - production due to the interactions with the lower energetic photons of the extragalactic background light ( ebl )  @xcite and the delay of the observations . within this scenario , magic has the advantage , compared to other iacts , in its low energy sensitivity and pointing speed  @xcite . throughout the paper",
    "the convention @xmath1 has been adopted in cgs units .",
    "grb090102 was detected and located by the _",
    "swift _ satellite  @xcite on january 02 , 2009 at 02:55:45 ut  @xcite .",
    "the prompt light curve is structured in four partially overlapping peaks for a total @xmath2 of @xmath3 s. since the burst was also detected by _",
    "konus wind _",
    "@xcite and _ integral _",
    "@xcite , it has been possible to obtain a very good reconstruction of the prompt emission spectral parameters . the time - averaged spectrum can be modeled with the classical band function  @xcite with peak energy @xmath4 kev and a total fluence in the 20 kev - 2 mev range of @xmath5 erg @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "early optical follow - up measurements were performed by many groups like tarot  @xcite at @xmath7 + 40.8 s , the rem robotic telescope at @xmath7 + 53 s  @xcite and grond telescope  @xcite at @xmath7 + 2.5 h. the optical light - curve , monitored from several tens of seconds to slightly more than a day from the @xmath7 , shows a steep - to - shallow behavior with a break at about 1ks . before the break ,",
    "the optical flux decay index is @xmath8 while the index became @xmath9 after the break , steeper and flatter respectively , when compared to the simultaneous x - ray emission .",
    "optical spectroscopy was rapidly carried out by the not telescope  @xcite deriving a redshift of z=1.547 , which allows to compute an isotropic energy value of @xmath10 erg and a rest frame peak energy of @xmath11=1149@xmath12 kev in good agreement with the amati relation .",
    "a detailed discussion of the follow up observations for this burst can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the magic telescope located at roque de los muchachos ( 28.75@xmath13n , 17.89@xmath13w , la palma , canary islands ) performed a follow - up measurement of grb090102 starting the observation at the position provided by _ swift _",

    "first data runs were taken at very low zenith angles from 5@xmath13 reaching 52@xmath13 at the end of datataking at 06:54:01 ut after 13149 s of observation .",
    "magic upper limits above 80 gev have already been published for this grb  @xcite while results and scientific discussion about a successive dedicated analysis focused in the low energy band  @xcite will be presented here . to ensure the lowest energy threshold , only data taken with zenith distance @xmath15 25@xmath13 ,",
    "corresponding to the first 5919 s of observation ( data sub - sample up to 04:53:32 ut ) has been taken into account during this analysis .",
    "together with the magic-1 sum trigger system  @xcite , it yields an analysis threshold around 30 gev evaluated using mc simulations . in order to accurately estimate the background from hadronic atmospheric showers , an off data sample has been taken one night later with the telescope pointing close to the burst location and in the same observational conditions and instrument setup . in spite of the excellent magic low energy analysis threshold , no significant",

    "differential upper limits with 95@xmath16 cl were evaluated .",
    "telescope efficiency was evaluated with a 30@xmath16 estimation of systematic uncertainties .",
    "however , the excellent low energy threshold for ground - based observations with cherenkov telescopes makes these observations particularly interesting in spite of the high redshift of grb090102 .",
    ".magic - i 95@xmath16 confidence level upper limits for the afterglow emission of grb090102 .",
    "the values correspond to the first 5919 s of observation from 03:14:52 ut to 04:53:32 ut for a zenith distance ranging between 5@xmath13 and 25@xmath13 . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the so - called standard scenario , known as the fireball model  @xcite , grb dynamics during the prompt phase are governed by relativistic collisions between shells of plasma emitted by a central engine ( internal shocks ) .",
    "similarly , the emission during the afterglow is thought to be connected to the shocks between these ejecta with the external medium ( external shocks ) . in both cases , the observed photons",
    "are radiation from particles accelerated to ultrarelativistic energies by successive collisions with magnetized medium ( fermi mechanism ) . even if the details of the acceleration process are not firmly known , several non - thermal mechanisms",
    "have been suggested to be sources of vhe photons .",
    "possible processes comprise both leptonic ( e.g. electron synchrotron , synchrotron self compton - ssc ) and hadronic models ( e.g. proton synchrotron )  @xcite . in the most plausible scenario ,",
    "electron synchrotron radiation is the dominant process in the low energy regime ( @xmath15 mev ) while ssc emission overwhelm other processes in the vhe range . as first approximation",
    ", a broken power - law can be used in modeling the expected emission .",
    "the relevant break energies of the spectrum will be the minimum injection @xmath17 and the cooling @xmath18 .",
    "the first one refers to emission frequency of the bulk of the electrons population while the cooling frequency identifies where electrons effectively cool .",
    "both are strongly dependent on the microphysical parameters used to describe the fireball and for the ssc are ( following  @xcite ) :    @xmath19\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath20\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 the medium particle density , @xmath22 is the energy per unit solid angle , @xmath23 the time delay after the grb onset ( in hours ) and @xmath24 is the source redshift .",
    "the slope of the electron energy distribution ( @xmath25 ) can be evaluated using the optical spectral index light - curve  @xcite and has been found to be @xmath26 in good agreement with numerical simulations which suggest a value of @xmath25 ranging between 2.2 - 2.3  @xcite . on the contrary , we can only constrain the values for the micro - physical parameters @xmath27 , the fraction of total energy going to electrons , and @xmath28 , the fraction of total energy going to magnetic fields . assuming that the optical light curve time break  @xcite is less then the start time of the shallow decay phase ( @xmath29 s ) , we obtain @xmath30 and @xmath31 which only barely fix the @xmath28 , @xmath27 values .",
    "we thus assume @xmath32 and @xmath33 which correspond to typical values for the late afterglow  @xcite",
    ". +              gamma ray absorption by pair production with extragalactic background light ( ebl ) limits the iacts capability in detecting sources at redshift @xmath341 .",
    "we adopted the model in  @xcite to evaluate the ebl absorption .",
    "the ebl intensity evaluated using this model matches the minimum level allowed by galaxy counts , which leads to the highest transparency of the universe to vhe @xmath35-rays .",
    "this is indeed an optimistic yet realistic scenario for grbs studies in the vhe regime . as a matter of fact",
    ", we have obtained a value for the optical depth @xmath36 of @xmath37 at about 40 gev .",
    "this gives an attenuation of the flux at the same energy of the order of @xmath38 , a value that does not significantly compromise the detection capability of magic .",
    "we have used the above derived equations in order to predict the expected emission in the magic energy range . from numerical results",
    "it is evident that , for both the chosen parameters and at the magic observation time , leptonic components are usually the dominant mechanisms from the low ( electron synchrotron emission ) to the very high energy ( ssc ) .",
    "magic observations ( @xmath0 40 gev ) were carried out in the sed region where @xmath39f@xmath40 so that it is possible to evaluate the expected ssc emission : @xmath41 which gives ( for our first energy bin and taking into account the ebl absorption ) @xmath42(40 gev)@xmath43 erg @xmath6 s@xmath44 .",
    "this result is below of about one order of magnitude ( in the first energy bins ) to the reported upper limits .",
    "however , a change in the microphysical fireball values can influence the vhe emission giving scenarios with substantially higher flux .",
    "we also explored the possibility of a strong and prevalent proton synchrotron component in the gev range .",
    "the cooling frequency for protons can in fact easily reach the gev regime since @xmath45 .",
    "however , the required energy budget ( @xmath46 erg ) and medium density ( @xmath47 @xmath48 ) needed to match the expected low energy flux with observed data is rather incompatible with the measured total energy release .",
    "this makes the possibility to observe the hadronic emission component with the magic telescope unrealistic , at least for a canonical fireball .",
    "other hadronic - induced emissions such as @xmath49 decay @xcite can have a non negligible effect with new features in the spectrum in a higher energies range .",
    "moreover , at these energies , @xmath50 , implying that lowering the temporal delay of the observations can make the expected emission higher by one order of magnitude .",
    "our estimates show that magic follow - up observations within few hundreds of seconds from the t@xmath51 would have the potential to detect this source .",
    "this demonstrates both the capabilities of the system and the necessity of a fast - response observations .",
    "although we could not yet set firm constraints on the main theoretical scenarios , our results show the interesting perspectives for an afterglow detection in very high energy domain .",
    "this energy range will have very high impact on the understanding of the grb phenomena and the unique opportunity of having simultaneous follow - up with _ fermi_/lat and the magic telescope will have an important role in constraining different emission mechanisms and the space parameters . +",
    "the above results will be discussed in a forthcoming dedicated publication together with the fermi / lat data .",
    "we would like to thank the instituto de astrofisica de canarias for the excellent working conditions at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos in la palma .",
