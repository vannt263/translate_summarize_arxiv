    "according to the general relativity the initial state of the universe was a causal singularity . in this point",
    "all time - like geodesics were cut off and has no extension into the past .",
    "this peculiar behaviour corresponds to the blow up of the curvature @xmath10 and energy density @xmath11 in the standard big - bang scenario .",
    "it is however believed that singularities of this kind are not real states but rather artifacts resulting from the fact that classical theory broke down . in the vicinity of the initial singularity ,",
    "when the universe reaches the planck scale energy , the quantum gravity effects were proposed as a mechanism to remove the singular behaviour .",
    "such a possibility was studied in the context of the string theory leading to the so called pre - big bang cosmological scenario @xcite .",
    "presently this issue is also studied extensively in the loop quantum cosmology ( lqc)@xcite where the avoidance of the initial singularity appeared in a natural way @xcite .",
    "this approach possesses other advantages like the adjustment of the proper initial conditions for the inflationary phase .",
    "the avoidance of the initial singularity appeared here in the form of the non - singular bouncing universe @xcite .",
    "namely , the universe is initially in the contracting phase , then reaches a minimal nonzero volume and due to quantum repulsion evolves toward an expanding phase .",
    "it should be stressed that this result has been strictly demonstrated so far only for isotropic models with a free , massless scalar field @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological dynamics of this scenario has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "however ambiguities in the quantization of the classical formula lead to some deviations . in the frame of the standard quantization scheme these ambiguities lead generally to the models with qualitatively similar bouncing behaviour .",
    "however like it was shown in @xcite , for some special setup in the effective flat frw model the bounce is replaced by non - singular oscillations .",
    "more drastic consequences appear when we choose the different quantization framework .",
    "this issue was studied in @xcite and it was found the existence of the finite scale factor curvature singularities in the co - existence with a quantum bounce . in this paper",
    "we continue these studies in the nonstandard quantization frameworks .",
    "we investigate the effects of resulting ambiguities for the dynamics of the effective frw models with the cosmological constant .",
    "we present simple methods of reducing dynamical equation governing evolution of the models with quantum corrections to the form of a 2-dimensional autonomous dynamical system of the newtonian type .",
    "we explore a mechanical analogy in investigation of different evolutionary scenarios .",
    "the organization of the text is the following . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we investigate possible kinds of ambiguities in the loop quantization , concentrating on the expression for the field strength operator @xmath0 .",
    "next , in section [ sec:3 ] we investigate resulting cosmological models with use of the qualitative methods analysis of dynamics . in section [ sec : summary ]",
    "we summarize the results .",
    "this section aims to summarize some key features of loop quantization of cosmological models and discusses arising ambiguities . in particular",
    "we extend study of the choice of the field strength operator @xmath0 began in @xcite .",
    "we restrict our consideration to the flat frw cosmological models which are given by the metric @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the lapse function and the spatial part of the metric is expressed as @xmath14 in this expression @xmath15 is the fiducial metric and @xmath16 are the co - triads dual to the triads @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 . based on the triads we can construct the ashtekar variables @xmath21 where @xmath22 the volume @xmath23 is the so called fiducial cell and is introduced to perform the integration on the non - compact spaces .",
    "we expect that the physical results should not depend on its value . however , when we introduce quantum modifications in general they can depend on the choice of @xmath24 .    in loop quantum cosmology",
    "we consider effects of the inverse volume corrections and holonomies . in the phenomenological considerations of the quantized frw @xmath25 model",
    "it is appropriate to take into account quantum modifications arising only from the field strength expressed in terms of holonomies . in some special case ( @xmath26 ) this kind of modification",
    "does not depend on the choice of the fiducial cell @xmath24 .",
    "this simplifies interpretation of results and make the correspondence with classical physics easier .",
    "this issue is related to the question of the loop quantization uniqueness of the cosmological models @xcite . because there is no defined length scale in the flat frw models the @xmath24 dependence seems to be unphysical .",
    "this problem is not present in the frw @xmath27 models , where the length scale is tied with the intrinsic curvature @xcite .",
    "the loop quantization requires to replace the classical variables by the quantum operators expressed in terms of the holonomies and fluxes . in the frw models",
    "holonomies reduce to almost periodic functions @xmath28 and fluxes reduce to variable @xmath1 multiplied by the kinematic factor @xcite",
    ". then algebra of variables @xmath1 and @xmath29 is quantized .",

    "the action of the operator @xmath35 is following @xmath36    we have defined a quantum kinematic sector of the loop quantum cosmology . now with use of these rules we aim to quantize the scalar constraint @xmath37 } \\right ] \\label{scalar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the extrinsic curvature is defined as @xmath38\\ ] ] which corresponds to @xmath39 .",
    "the scalar constraint quantum operator should be expressed in terms of the elementary operators @xmath32 and @xmath35 . in our considerations",
    "we restrict ourselves to quantization of the field strength @xmath40 .",
    "the rest of the terms lead to quantum operators expressed in term of the inverse volume operator .",
    "detailed analysis of the scalar constraint quantization can be found in @xcite .",
    "as we have said our main interest is to find a formula for the field strength operator @xmath0 .",
    "the standard approach to introduce this operator is to consider a closed path @xmath41 and holonomy along this loop .",
    "such a holonomy can be written as @xmath42 where particular holonomies are @xmath43 with use of the above expressions one can derive formula @xmath44}{\\mu^2 v_0^{2/3 } }   { ^o\\omega^i_a}{^o\\omega^j_b }   + \\frac{\\mathcal{o}(\\mu^4)}{\\mu^2}. \\label{classf}\\ ] ]    based on this expression we can define the quantum field strength operator .",
    "however , we should discuss some related issues .",
    "firstly , quantization of the area operator in the loop quantum gravity leads to the existence of the area gap @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "this means that the limit @xmath46 of the area enclosed by the loop does not exist .",
    "we should stop shrinking the loop at a minimal area which is related to limiting @xmath47 value .",
    "this process is however ambiguous and generally limiting @xmath48 can have a form @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xcite and @xmath51 is dimension - full and positive real parameter .",
    "in particular , from this expression we can recover known @xmath52-scheme for which @xmath53 in this case the area gap @xmath54 corresponds to the physical area of the loop @xmath55 . the range of the @xmath4 parameter written above can be obtained from the considerations of the lattice states @xcite .",
    "further restrictions for value of this parameter come from considerations of the anomaly cancellation in the inhomogeneous cosmological models and positivity of the graviton effective mass , giving @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the properties considered should be now taken into account during the construction of the operator @xmath0 .",
    "the standard procedure is to cut - off the terms @xmath57 and perform the limit @xmath58 in expression ( [ classf ] ) , what gives @xcite @xmath59}{\\mu^2 v_0^{2/3 } }   { ^o\\omega^i_a}{^o\\omega^j_b } = \\frac {   \\sin^2\\left(\\bar{\\mu } c \\right ) } { \\bar{\\mu}^2 v_0^{2/3 } } \\epsilon_{kij }   { ^o\\omega^i_a}{^o\\omega^j_b}. \\label{op1}\\ ] ] this is the well defined operator on the hilbert space @xmath60 .",
    "namely , due to relation @xmath61 it can be expressed in terms of the operator @xmath62 and due to the power - low @xmath63 dependence this part can be expressed in terms of the operator @xmath32 .",
    "the proper classical behaviour is also obtained , it means that no information about classical expression is contained in the terms @xmath57 .",
    "these terms simply vanish in the classical limit @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "another motivation to consider ( [ op1 ] ) as a proper quantum operator is the resulting dynamics .",
    "namely , this quantum operator leads to the avoidance of the initial singularity .",
    "however we can ask what happens when a part of the @xmath57 contribute to the definition of the operator @xmath0 ?",
    "the resulting operator has proper classical behaviour , because the contribution from @xmath57 vanishes in the classical limit .",
    "however on the quantum level the operator @xmath0 contain some new terms which influence quantum dynamics .",
    "it is worth to stress this property .",
    "this additional modification term , which influence dynamics in the quantum regime , does not correspond to any contribution on the classical level .",
    "the possibility of existence of such terms lead to the ambiguity in the definition of the operator @xmath0 .",
    "however not all modifications which fulfil well the classical limit are allowed .",
    "another property which must hold is that the resulting operator must be defined on the hilbert space @xmath31 .    in the paper",
    "@xcite the expression for the @xmath0 operator including the term @xmath57 was calculated @xmath66 expanding the square we obtain @xmath67 ^ 2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{\\sin^4 ( \\bar{\\mu } c)}{\\bar{\\mu}^2 } + \\dots .",
    "\\label{expansion}\\ ] ] we see that the first term in this series corresponds to the standard field strength operator .",
    "other parts vanish in the limit @xmath68 and have no classical meaning . with use of the formula",
    "@xmath61 we can express the series in terms of the operator @xmath62 .",
    "in the next section we apply the modified expression for the field strength operators investigated above in the cosmological models .",
    "our goal is to find whether such modifications lead to singular behaviour and how the bouncing universe scenario is modified .",
    "we will restrict to the flat frw models with the free scalar field and the cosmological constant content .",
    "our analysis concentrates on the investigation of the effective equations rather than strict quantum dynamics .",
    "so we obtain information only about evolutions of the mean values of the canonical parameters .",
    "the information about dispersions is unavailable in such an approach .",
    "we will consider both full modifications from the term @xmath57 as well quadratic modifications from the expression ( [ expansion ] ) .",
    "the dynamical equations resulting from loop quantum cosmology corrections can not be integrated in the exact form and that is why the qualitative methods of differential equations can provide us with a powerful tool for investigations of evolutional paths of the models under considerations .",
    "the main advantage of using these methods lies in possibility of examine of all solutions for all admissible initial conditions in the geometric language of a phase space ( space of all states at any time ) . as a result",
    "we obtain description of global dynamics of these models , i.e. , the phase portrait from which we obtain their clear stability analysis . in the dynamical systems framework",
    "the crucial role plays the critical points ( for which right - hand sides of dynamical system vanish ) and the trajectories joining them . from the physical point of view",
    "the critical points represent stationary states of the system or asymptotic states . on the other hand trajectories represent evolution of the system .",
    "the famous hartman - grobman theorem @xcite tell us that linearization of the system at this critical points ( non - degenerate ) contain all necessary information about its behaviour in neighbourhood of this critical point . from the linearization matrix",
    "we obtain all necessary information concerning the type of the critical point as well as its stability .",
    "the dynamics of cosmological models under considerations can be reduced to the 2-dimensional dynamical systems of the newtonian type with the total energy @xmath69 and the potential @xmath70 . as it is well known @xcite for such systems only two types of critical points are admissible , namely a saddle ( if eigenvalues of the linearization matrix are real of opposite signs ) or a centre ( if eigenvalues of the linearization matrix are purely imaginary and conjugate ) .",
    "while the first type of critical points is structurally stable , the second one is structurally unstable , i.e. , small changes of its right - hand sides disturb the global phase portrait which is defined modulo a homeomorphism which establishes the equivalence of the global dynamics .",
    "of course the motion of the system in the configuration space takes place in the domain admissible for motion determined by condition of non - negativity kinetic energy form , @xmath71 is non - negative .",
    "the critical points of the system are always located at the extrema of a diagram of the potential function ( if we have an inflection point on the diagram then the corresponding point is degenerated ) .",
    "if in the diagram of the potential function we have local maxima then they correspond to saddles on the phase portrait . in turn",
    "if we have local minima on the diagram then in the phase space the centre type of the critical point is present .",
    "note that for systems under consideration all critical points in the phase space must lie on the @xmath1 axis and they represent static einstein universes .",
    "apart from the critical points at the finite domain there are present physically interesting critical points at infinity .",
    "therefore for the full study of dynamics of the system the analysis of behaviour of trajectories at infinity is necessary . for this",
    "aims we complete the plane by adding to it a circle at infinity via the poincar sphere construction or equivalently by introducing the projective coordinates ( the construction of the projective plane ) @xcite .",
    "in our case on the circle at infinity critical points are located which represents the de sitter universes if @xmath26 .",
    "due to the particle - like description of dynamics in the notion of classical mechanics we obtain a simple description of evolution in terms of particle moving in the potential well .",
    "we can classify all evolutionary pats in both configuration and phase spaces .",
    "it is important that the dynamics is fully characterized by a single potential function @xmath72 .",
    "if we have the global phase portraits of the cosmological models then one can discuss how different models with a desired property , say a singularity , bounce , acceleration are distributed in the ensemble .",
    "are they typical or generic ?",
    "the answer for these questions are interesting in cosmological context when problem of initial conditions is crucial .      in the case of @xmath73 modifications",
    "the phenomenological hamiltonian takes a form @xmath74 where matter part contains the free scalar field and the cosmological constant @xmath75 the hamiltonian [ hamphen1 ] traces the effects of the @xmath73 modifications .",
    "however it must be emphasized that it is not necessarily the true effective hamiltonian .",
    "it mean that solutions of the hamilton equation @xmath76 not necessarily traces the mean values of the quantum operator @xmath77 .",
    "this issue must be verified by the full quantum treatment .    from the hamiltonian equation we obtain evolution of the canonical variable @xmath1 @xmath78 based on this result and the hamiltonian constraint @xmath79",
