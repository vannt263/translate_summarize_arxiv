    "because in the standard model the top quark width @xmath1  gev is much larger than the typical hadronization energy @xmath2 , the total cross section @xmath3 in the threshold region @xmath4 can be computed with perturbative methods to very high precision .",
    "the rapid rise of the cross section in the threshold region will allow for a measurement of the top quark mass ( in a threshold mass scheme  @xcite ) with experimental and theoretical uncertainties at the level of only @xmath5  mev .",
    "other parameters such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 or ( if the higgs boson is light ) the top yukawa coupling @xmath8 can also be determined if the normalization and the exact form of the line - shape can be computed with small theoretical errors at the percent level  @xcite .",
    "this is required because the observable cross section is a convolution of the theory prediction with the partly machine - dependent @xmath0 luminosity spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical instrument to make first principles predictions for top threshold observables is based on nrqcd , an effective theory ( eft ) of qcd for heavy quark pairs with small relative velocity @xmath9 . within `` velocity '' nrqcd ( vnrqcd )  @xcite , which we will use here , it is possible to sum coulomb singularities and ( using renormalization group methods ) logarithms of @xmath10 to all orders of qcd perturbation theory while a systematic and coherent @xmath10 power counting is maintained .",
    "the summation of logarithms avoids large normalization uncertainties  @xcite that were obtained in earlier fixed - order predictions  @xcite . at nnll order ( i.e. including corrections of order @xmath11 and the summation of terms @xmath12 ) all qcd ingredients for the threshold cross section",
    "are presently known except for still missing subleading mixing effects in the running of the heavy quark pair production current .",
    "the current normalization qcd uncertainties of the total cross section are estimated to be around @xmath13  @xcite .    in this talk",
    "we are interested in electroweak effects . at leading order ,",
    "the three basic electroweak effects are the @xmath14 production process itself , the finite top lifetime and the luminosity spectrum mentioned above .",
    "the latter is accounted for in the experimental simulations  @xcite , the two former effects are described by nrqcd . here",
    "we want to discuss finite top lifetime effects at the subleading level including qcd interference effects .",
    "previous partial analyses have indicated that the corrections can reach the level of a few percent  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we investigate the role of absorptive parts related to the top quark decay in electroweak loop corrections to the nrqcd matching conditions that contribute to the nnll total cross section .",
    "interestingly , these corrections lead to uv phase space divergences that would not exist for stable top quarks and that lead to a nll renormalization of @xmath15 operators that also contributes to the total cross section . for details of our analysis we refer the interested reader to ref .  @xcite .",
    "let us first recall the power counting to classify the order at which electroweak effects can contribute by considering the matching conditions for the vnrqcd bilinear quark field operators .",
    "electroweak corrections are obtained by matching 2-point functions in the effective theory to those in qcd _ and _ the electroweak theory .",
    "the nnll result including also all qcd contributions has the form  @xcite @xmath16 where the fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 destroy top and antitop quarks with momentum @xmath19 and _ positive _ energies , @xmath20 is the ultrasoft gauge covariant derivative and @xmath7 is the top quark width defined at the ( electroweak ) top quark pole . the @xmath10-counting is @xmath21 since the top width is of order of the typical top kinetic energy , which defines the ultrasoft scale @xmath22 .",
    "this leads to the counting for the su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge couplings @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where we can treat the weak mixing being of order one .",
    "the term @xmath25 is a residual mass term of order @xmath11 that arises within threshold mass schemes  @xcite .",
    "its electroweak contributions are straightforward to compute and will not be discussed here further .",
    "the term @xmath26 describes the finite lifetime at ll order and the nnll time dilatation effects .",
    "it produces the known replacement rule @xmath27  @xcite to account for finite lifetime effects at ll order .",
    "although it renders the effective lagrangian formally non - hermitian ( since hermitian conjugation does _ not _ change its sign ) , the eft inherits unitarity from the underlying theory , so we can later use the optical theorem to compute the total rates .",
    "it is crucial to understand that the effects of the top decay represent hard physics that can be integrated out ( i.e. treated by the matching condition @xmath28 ) and that , therefore , one can determine the corresponding eft matching conditions for on - shell top quark amplitudes .",
    "this is analogous to the treatment of photons in an absorptive medium in the optical theory .",
    "so to account for all nnll order electroweak effects to eq .",
    "( [ lke ] ) one still has to include the one - loop electroweak and the @xmath29 and @xmath30 qcd corrections to the on - shell top width @xmath7 which will also not be discussed here any further .    concerning the @xmath14 interaction at ll order we only need to consider the coulomb potential , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the vnrqcd renormalization scaling parameter .",
    "since effects from the top decay are hard ( @xmath33 ) , we can neglect the momentum exchange @xmath34 in the electroweak loops during the matching computation . from this",
    "it is easy to see that all the @xmath35 ( vertex and wave function ) corrections to the coulomb potential cancel due to su(3 ) gauge invariance .",
    "since all electroweak corrections to the @xmath36 suppressed potentials are beyond nnll order simply by counting powers of @xmath10 and @xmath23 , we also do nt have to consider any electroweak corrections to these potentials .",
    "the same argument applies to electroweak corrections to the interactions of top quarks with the soft gluons ( @xmath37 ) or potential four - quark operators caused by electroweak box diagrams ; the former can only contribute to @xmath29 corrections to the potentials , and the latter are already @xmath38 suppressed without even accounting for the powers of @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , the coulomb interaction does not generate any uv divergences , so electroweak nnll contributions due to mixing do also not exist .",

    "we can show that this statement even holds at nnll order . for the time - like ultrasoft @xmath45 gluons",
    ", qcd gauge invariance ensures that the dominant electroweak matching corrections to the @xmath45 interaction vertex shown in eq .",
    "( [ lke ] ) vanish because we can again approximate the ultrasoft gluon momentum in the electroweak loop as zero .",

    "is regularized by the top quark mass .",
    "it is important that the divergences only exist because the top quark is not treated as a stable particle .",

    "uv divergences of the same kind for the nnll total cross section have been observed and noted before  @xcite , but no resolution of the issue was provided . from the point of view of having an eft with non - hermitian contributions",
    "it is obvious that these uv divergences must be handled in the canonical way using renormalization .",
    "since the divergences are directly related to operators with non - hermitian wilson coefficients , the renormalization procedure will naturally involve operators with non - hermitian wilson coefficients .",

    "note that in the 1s scheme @xmath115 .",
    "for the top quark width we adopted the value @xmath116  gev . note that in a complete analysis of electroweak effects the top quark width depends on the input parameters given above and is not an independent parameter .",
    "for the purpose of the numerical analysis in this work , however , our treatment is sufficient .",

    "we find that the corrections are around @xmath117 for energies below the peak , between @xmath118 and @xmath119 close to the peak and about @xmath118 above the peak .",
    "interestingly , they partly compensate the sizeable positive qcd corrections found in  @xcite . the peculiar energy dependence of the corrections , caused by the dependence on the real part of the green function @xmath72 , also leads to a slight displacement of the peak position .",
    "relative to the peak position of the ll cross section one obtains a shift of @xmath120  mev for @xmath121 .",
