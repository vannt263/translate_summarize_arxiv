    "transverse spin phenomena of the nucleon in scattering processes have received a lot of attention in recent years since they provide new insights on the understanding of hadron structure ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "particularly , an ideal tool to probe the transverse spin structure of the nucleon is the single - spin asymmetry ( ssa ) in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) off the transversely polarized target , as reflected in numerous studies from both theory and experiment .",
    "the typical transverse ssas appearing in sidis are the sivers asymmetry  @xcite and the collins asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "the sivers asymmetry has a @xmath6 modulation , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the azimuthal angles of the detected hadron and the nucleon spin with respect to the lepton scattering plane .",
    "it involves the convolution of the sivers function  @xcite that is a t - odd transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) distribution function , and the ordinary unpolarized fragmentation function ( ff ) .",
    "the collins asymmetry has a @xmath9 azimuthal angular dependence , and can be interpreted in terms of the transversity distribution function  @xcite , combined with the collins ff  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of the above mentioned asymmetries is that they appears at leading twist , thereby those effects should not be unsuppressed at high energies .",
    "indeed significant asymmetries were measured by the hermes collaboration  @xcite , the compass collaboration  @xcite and jefferson lab ( jlab ) hall a collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding data have been utilized to extract  @xcite the sivers function and transversity distribution , within the tmd factorization  @xcite . at leading twist",
    "there is another transverse ssa , related to the pretzelosity distribution  @xcite , and it was measured by the hall a collaboration  @xcite through its characteristic @xmath10 moment very recently .",
    "however , the leading - twist ssas do not exhaust all possible azimuthal dependences in sidis off a transversely polarized target from an unpolarized lepton beam .",
    "as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , theoretically there are two more angular modulations ( assuming one photon exchange ) , the @xmath0 and the @xmath11 moments , appearing in the the process @xmath12 .",
    "experimentally there is also an attempt  @xcite to measure those asymmetries .",
    "the leading - twist dynamics can not account for them . according to the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the partonic picture , these asymmetries can be explained by the convolution of various twist-3 distribution / fragmantation functions with twist-2 fragmentation / distribution functions . although the transverse spin asymmetries from the dynamical subleading - twist effects can shed light on the transverse spin structure of the nucleon at twist 3 , there are still less systematic studies and calculations on the @xmath13 and @xmath14 asymmetries in literature , especially from the phenomenological point of view .",
    "we notice that sizable spin asymmetries related to subleading - twist dynamics have already been measured in other sidis processes , such as the longitudinal - target ssa  @xcite , as well as the longitudinal - beam ssa  @xcite",
    ". therefore it will be quite necessary to investigate also the roles of twist-3 tmd distributions and ffs in the transverse ssas , and to study the feasibility of experimental measurements on them , which are the main purpose of this work .",
    "both twist-3 distributions and ffs could give rise to the transverse ssas . in this paper",
    ", we will focus particularly on the contributions from twist-3 distributions .",
    "we note that in the common reference frame  @xcite used to analyze sidis , the interaction - dependent twist-3 ffs ( denoted with a tilde ) also appear in the convolution . in practical calculation",
    "these ffs may be set to zero in the wandzura - wilczek approximation  @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies  @xcite on the contributions of the chirally and time - reversal odd ffs to the ssa in proton - proton collisions within the collinear twist-3 factorization , show that the fragmentation contributions from three parton correlation could still be sizeable . in the light of those studies , it is possible that the contributions in sidis to the @xmath0 and @xmath11 asymmetries from the chiral- and t - odd ff @xmath15 might also be non - negligible .",
    "although it is interesting to investigate the effect of @xmath15 to the ssas in sidis , the connection between the tmd - type ff and the collinear - type ff at the twist-3 level is still not clear .",
    "therefore , in this work we will not consider the fragmentation contributions , but will remain them as a future study . in this scenario , then four twist-3 tmd distributions are involved in the transverse ssas : @xmath2 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the first one contributes to the @xmath0 asymmetry , while the second one contributes to the @xmath14 asymmetry ; the last two distributions contribute to both asymmetries through the convolution with the collins ff .",
    "the remained content of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we calculate the tmd distributions @xmath2 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 valence quarks , as it is necessary to know their magnitudes and signs to predict ssas . as a demonstration we will use the spectator - diquark model developed in ref .",

    "this is because the @xmath204 at compass ( @xmath205  @xcite ) is larger than those at hermes ( @xmath206  @xcite ) and jlab ( @xmath207  @xcite ) , and the effect under study appears at subleading twist , thereby its size is suppressed by a factor @xmath208 . in the case of the asymmetry @xmath209 ,",

    "we find that the estimated asymmetries are sizable , especially at hermes and jlab , where the magnitude of the asymmetries can reach to 3 per cent at most .",
    "furthermore , the comparison between different origins of the asymmetries shows that the t - odd twist-3 tmd distributions play an important role in these asymmetries . for the @xmath0 asymmetry , the @xmath170 term dominates in @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 production , while the @xmath171 and @xmath172 terms are almost negligible .",
    "also , the asymmetry from the @xmath170 term tends to be positive at small @xmath146 region , while it turns to be negative in large @xmath146 region , due to the @xmath77-shape of the distribution @xmath2 . for the @xmath1 asymmetry , in the most cases ,",
    "the main contribution is from the @xmath180 term ; the effects of the @xmath171 and @xmath172 terms might be observed in the asymmetry for @xmath168 production at jlab , according to our numerical calculation .",
    "based on the above results , we conclude that sizable @xmath0 and @xmath1 asymmetries may be accessible at the kinematics of hermes , jlab and compass , by performing the sidis experiments on the transverse polarized proton target or analyzing the available data .",
    "the measurements on the @xmath146-dependence of the asymmetry @xmath147 may be employed to test the transverse momentum dependence of the distribution @xmath2 , e.g. , the existence of a node of @xmath2 in @xmath77 . moreover , measuring the @xmath0 and @xmath1 asymmetries for @xmath169 production , in which the contributions from @xmath3 and @xmath4 are negligible , are viable to provide clean probes on both the distributions @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "future experiments on these aspects can deepen our understanding on the role of twist-3 tmd distributions in transverse spin asymmetries .",
