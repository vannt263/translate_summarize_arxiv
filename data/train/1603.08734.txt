    "currently a number of intense mid - infrared light sources are being developed @xcite , spurred on by their uses in sub - attosecond pulse generation @xcite , strong - field holography @xcite and laser - induced electron diffraction @xcite .",
    "the low frequency and high intensity of these new sources mean that the tunneling picture is an appropriate framework for describing how these light sources interact with atoms and molecules . in this work we deal with the process of dissociative tunneling ionization in molecules , where a static electric field tunnel ionizes an electron , after which the nuclei dissociate . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first work on the theory of dissociative tunneling ionization . in the theory",
    "we treat the nuclear and electronic degrees freedom on an equal footing and fully quantum mechanically .",
    "the reflection principle  @xcite is often used to describe the process of dissociative ionization .",
    "this principle can be applied within the framework of the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation to relate the nuclear kinetic energy release ( ker ) spectrum to the nuclear wave function .",
    "it was formulated as early as 1928  @xcite , and later put on a more rigorous foundation  @xcite ( see also references therein for a list of early uses ) . in time - dependent cases where the time - scale of the electric field is shorter than that of nuclear motion",
    ", one assumes that the electrons make an instantaneous frank - condon transition to a dissociative electronic state .",
    "the probability distribution in the new electronic state is then the absolute value squared of the initial nuclear wave function times some dipole coupling factor . in case",
    "this dipole coupling factor is almost constant , the wave packet that enters the dissociative state is practically identical to the initial nuclear wave function .",
    "classical energy conservation then dictates that the nuclear ker spectrum can be obtained by reflecting the nuclear wave function in the dissociative potential curve .",
    "this is the regime considered mostly in the literature . in the time - independent tunneling case , the electronic ionization rate takes the same role as the dipole coupling factor in the time - dependent case , that is , it multiplies the nuclear wave function before it enters the continuum .",
    "however , this electronic rate has an exponential dependence on the internuclear coordinate and can by no means be considered constant ( as was also pointed out in ref .",
    "it is therefore essential to consider the effect of this additional factor on the ker spectrum ; the spectrum can not be found simply by reflection of the nuclear wave function .",
    "imaging of the nuclear wave function is made possible through the reflection principle , by applying it in reverse on a measured ker spectrum @xcite .",
    "this is often referred to as coulomb explosion imaging . in the tunneling case the exponential dependence of the electronic rate on the internuclear",
    "coordinate means that the product of the electronic rate and the nuclear wave function is essentially different from the bare nuclear wave function , and the electronic rate therefore needs to be included to image the nuclear wave function based on the ker spectrum . in ref .  @xcite it was demonstrated that the bo approximation breaks down for weak fields . in this case",

    "in the classically allowed region at large negative @xmath152 the maximum of the wave function follows a classical trajectory .",
    "this is a prediction of the wkb theory , which applies as long we are not too close to the turning line .",
    "the classical trajectories can be found using newton s second law    @xmath153    [ eq : clas_traj_newton ]    a tempting choice of initial condition for the differential eqs .",
    "( [ eq : clas_traj_newton ] ) would be to choose the @xmath154 values at the intersection of the outer turning line and the maximum ridge of the wave function , with zero velocity in both @xmath152 and @xmath119 direction .",
    "however , the wkb fails near the turning line , and therefore we can not expect the wave function to follow a classical trajectory here . instead we have chosen as initial condition some point at the maximum of the wave function at a large negative @xmath152 value away from the turning line .",
    "the influence of the @xmath155 potential can be neglected for sufficiently large negative @xmath152 , in this region we can write the separated energy conservation equations    @xmath156    [ eq : clas_traj_energy ]    the initial velocities have then been determined from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : clas_traj_energy ] ) , using the real part of the total ( quantum ) energy for @xmath157 and the @xmath49 at which the ker spectrum @xmath120 [ eq .  ( [ eq : spec_expr_1d ] ) ] peaks .",
    "the classical trajectories shown in fig .  [ fig : wf ] were found using such initial conditions , and then propagated inwards .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : wf ] it can be seen that contrary to the exact wave function , the position of the ridge of the bo wave function in @xmath119 does not change with @xmath152 .",
    "this is expected as the bo approximation appears in the limit of infinite nuclear mass , so classical motion in the nuclear coordinate is not possible .",
    "the asymptotic wave function that we can image using eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf_expansion ] ) is therefore a non - bo wave function .",
    "it might seem strange that the bo is able to give the correct ker spectrum when the spectrum is the norm square of the expansion coefficients of the asymptotic wave function , and the bo gives a wrong description of this asymptotic wave function .",
    "however , the fact that the bo wave function does not obtain a probability current ( or velocity in the classical picture ) in the @xmath119-direction does not alter its projection on the continuum states .",
    "the important point is whether the bo wave function is similar to the exact wave function as it emerges at the outer turning line after tunneling , and this is the case if the turning line is within the critical bo distance @xmath147 [ eq .  (",
    "[ eq : z_bo ] ) ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : wf ] we also see that for the larger field strength the tunneling is completed before the critical bo distance is reached , contrary to at the smaller field strength .",
    "we see that for the large field strength the electronic and full turning lines agree quite well in the region where most of the wave function is localized , but for the smaller field strength they do not .     for @xmath158 .",
    "solid purple lines : full turning lines @xmath159 .",
    "the long dashed red line shows for each @xmath12 the @xmath119 at which the wave function @xmath160 has its maximum .",
    "the solid pink line shows a classical trajectory [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : clas_traj_newton ] ) ] .",
    "the black dot at the end of the classical trajectory is the exit point @xmath161 determined from the maximum of the spectrum @xmath162 ( see main text ) .",
    "the short dashed lines are the simple straight line estimates for the tunneling and initial classical motion described around eq .",
    "( [ eq : directions ] ) . ]",
    "one can notice that a phenomenon reminiscent of light refraction occurs for the wave function around the turning line in fig .",
    "[ fig : wf ] .",
    "it is evident , that the direction in which the maximum of the wave function moves changes noticeably at the turning line , when the wave function escapes from the classically forbidden tunneling region into the classically allowed region .",
    "the change of direction is due to the two different types of motion involved .",
    "when the wave function emerges from the tunneling region it has essentially zero average velocity in the @xmath119 direction .",
    "this means that we can apply the reflection principle in reverse on the spectrum to find the @xmath163 coordinate at which the maximum of the wave function emerges from the tunneling region by the relation @xmath164 , where @xmath162 is the value of @xmath49 for which the spectrum @xmath120 has its maximum . the @xmath12 value corresponding to this @xmath163 can then by found by considering the turning line @xmath165 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : wf_max ] we see that near the turning line the location of the wave function ridge differs from the classical trajectory .",
    "this is expected , since the prediction that the wave function ridge should follow a classical trajectory comes from wkb theory , which fails near the turning line .",
    "nevertheless , we can roughly describe the dissociative tunneling ionization process in two steps .",
    "first the system tunnels from the central region around @xmath166 to the exit point @xmath161 .",
    "this motion can roughly be described by a straight line from the maximum of the nuclear wave function @xmath123 that has the largest @xmath119 value , since this is the maximum that will dominate the tunneling , to the exit point .",
    "notice that this tunneling is not simply the electron tunneling out , but a correlated process involving both the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom . in the classically allowed region",
    "the initial direction of the wave function from the exit point can be found from the classical trajectory : the initial slope of the classical trajectory that starts at the exit point @xmath161 with zero velocity in both @xmath12 and @xmath119 directions can be found to be @xmath167 this is not exactly the trajectory that describes the motion of the wave function ridge , but it is quite close .",
    "these two directions are different as they come from different types of motion , and hence we see the refraction - like phenomenon at the turning line .",
    "we have formulated theory for the dissociative tunneling ionization process , and derived exact formulas for the ker spectrum , as well as approximations in the framework of the bo and reflection approximations .",
    "we have demonstrated that the reflection principle can be used in conjunction with the bo approximation to image the field - dressed nuclear wave function from the ker spectrum . for weaker fields ,",
    "where the bo approximation fails , the wfat can be used to find the ker spectrum .",
    "we have also demonstrated a qualitative difference between asymptotic bo and exact wave functions , as the latter shows classical motion in the nuclear coordinate , whereas the former does not move at all due to the infinite nuclear mass of the bo approximation . around the turning line",
