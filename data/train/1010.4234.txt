    "there has been large activity for many years in the study of the temporal evolution of an initially localized energy excitation in various nonlinear systems , e.g.  the discrete , nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) @xcite , fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) @xcite and klein - gordon ( kg ) model @xcite with both uniform and random couplings . in the latter case , the main interest is in the interplay of anharmonicity ( nonlinearity ) and disorder which is not yet fully understood . for harmonic one - dimensional disordered systems , all eigenmodes ( called anderson modes ) of the _ infinite _ system",
    "are known to be localized and form a complete basis .",
    "then a wave packet at time @xmath12 will remain localized at any time as a linear superposition of anderson modes of the infinite chain . whether or not this behavior changes qualitatively by introduction of anharmonicity is highly debated and controversial ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "since an analytical treatment of the time evolution of anharmonic systems with disorder is extremely difficult , most investigations have been done by molecular dynamics simulations . in the numerical studies ,",
    "one typically follows the wavepacket dynamics by monitoring quantities like the participation ratio @xmath13 ( a measure the localization at time @xmath14 ) , and the time - dependent moments @xmath15 of the local energy @xmath16 ( see the definitions below ) .",
    "all this measurements are hampered by statistical errors as well as finite size and finite time effects .",
    "even very long calculation times of , say , 10@xmath17 microscopic time units ( of order picoseconds ) may not be entirely conclusive . indeed , one can never be sure whether the spreading of a wavepacket is complete or only partial in the infinite - time limit .",
    "this issues are intimately related to the spontaneous self - trapping of energy ( for example in the form of discrete breathers ) which is generic in most nonlinear systems .    independently on complete or incomplete spreading",
    ", one might expect that the evolution of the wavepacket tails should yield relevant information on the spreading process itself .",
    "in such regions , the typical displacement becomes small enough such that linear approximation of the forces becomes valid .",
    "this motivates the investigation of the harmonic chain , as a first necessary step for an insight of the nonlinear case . despite the apparent simplicity of such a case",
    "there are still issues that have not been fully discussed in the literature .",
    "let us briefly review some of the main results known for this case . without disorder all eigenstates are extended and it is well - known ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) that @xmath18 with @xmath19 , i.e. the energy spreading is ballistic ( note that @xmath20 is not necessarily an integer ) .",
    "introducing disorder and/or anharmonicities , this energy transport is changed and may be superdiffusive ( @xmath21 ) , diffusive ( @xmath22 ) or subdiffusive ( @xmath23 ) , or it could become logarithmic or disappear ( @xmath24 ) . if the initial excitation is at site zero with amplitude @xmath25 , then the disorder averaged propagator @xmath26 is one of the basic quantities .",
    "although @xmath27 for @xmath28 is known analytically for different classes of disorder @xcite , much less is known for @xmath29 . approximating the anderson modes by plane waves with exponentially decaying amplitudes",
    ", it has been shown in ref .",

    "eq.([approx ] ) shows for @xmath32 there are two humps which propagate ballistically at the sound velocity @xmath33 , but with an amplitude which decays as @xmath35 . within its co - moving frame ,",
    "these humps spread as for normal diffusion .",
    "another approach for calculating @xmath36 is to use a scaling hypothesis @xcite    @xmath37    for the laplace transform of @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "a similar ansatz can be made for @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath41 denotes a localization length .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the energy profile @xmath42 averaged on time and disorder of a wavepacket originating an initially localized excitation .",
    "we demonstrate that it asymptotically decays as a power law in space .",
    "thus , the wavepacket remains localized only weakly while its moments appear to diverge in time .",
    "this result , which , to the best of our knowledge , has not been reported previously , must be taken into account expecially when attacking more difficult nonlinear case .",
    "indead , some numerical results for the anharmonic chain ( a fpu model ) will be critically analyzed on the basis of the results on the harmonic one .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we will introduce the harmonic model , rephrase some of its well - known properties , define the local energy @xmath16 and give some information on our numerical approach . a virial theorem for the time averaged local kinetic and potential energy",
    "will be proven in section iii .",
    "it will be applied in this section for the analytical calculation of the time and disorder average of @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding analytical result will be compared with the numerical one .",
    "furthermore we will investigate the moments @xmath15 of the local energy @xmath43 .",
    "the influence of anharmonicity on @xmath44 will be numerically studied in section iv , and the final section v contains a summary and some conclusions .",

    "otherwise , we shall perform analytical calculations in the thermodynamic limit @xmath55 where the choice of the boundary conditions does not matter .",

    "they satisfy @xmath65 and they can be normalized , except the uniform eigenmode @xmath66 with @xmath67 which is extended and can not be normalized for the infinite system . for any size @xmath53 of a finite system",

    ", all eigenmodes are localized , except this single zero - frequency mode which is extended .",
    "however , nothing changes in the problem when choosing the center of mass of the whole system immobile at @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "though the eigenspectrum is discrete for the infinite system , it is dense .",
    "the corresponding density of states @xmath71 is a smooth function which is known @xcite to be self - averaging , i.e. it is independent on the disorder realization with probability one .",
    "moreover , in the small frequency limit , @xmath72 , we have @xcite @xmath73    the localized eigenmodes , decay exponentially with a localization length @xcite @xmath74 which diverges at the lower `` band '' edge at @xmath67 .    then , if the chain is finite with length @xmath75 , there is a frequency @xmath76 such that the localization length equals the system size , i.e @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , only the eigenmodes with frequency @xmath78 can be considered as well localized inside the finite system .",
    "while the remaining modes where @xmath79 extend over the whole finite system .",
    "their number which is of order of @xmath80 goes to infinity in the limit of an infinite system despite their relative weight for @xmath55 goes to zero as @xmath81 . as a result",
    ", they still play a role for transport quantities , like the energy diffusion constant @xcite or the thermal conductivity @xcite .",

    "the increase of the localization length for weak disorder and the increase of the relevant time scale of the relaxation for strong disorder probably are also the reasons for the absence of a convincing scaling of the moments @xmath330 . in order to test this",
