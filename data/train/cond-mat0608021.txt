    "synchronization in the sense of coordinated behavior in time is essential for any efficient organization of systems , natural as well as artificial ones . in artificial systems like factories the sequence of production processes",
    "should be synchronized in a way that time - and space consuming storage of input or intermediate products is avoided .",
    "the same applies to natural systems like networks of cells which obviously perform very efficiently in fulfilling a variety of functions and tasks . in a more special sense",
    ", the synchronized behavior refers to oscillators with almost identical individual units , in particular to phase oscillators with continuous interactions as described by the kuramoto model @xcite .",
    "these sets of limit - cycle oscillators describe synchronization phenomena in a wide range of applications @xcite .",
    "one of these applications is pattern formation in chemical oscillatory systems @xcite , described by reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "a well - known example for such a chemical system is the belousov - zabotinsky reaction , a mixture of bromate , bromomalonic acid and ferroin , which periodically changes its color corresponding to oscillating concentrations of the red , reduced state and the blue , oxidized state . in these systems , expanding target - like waves and rotating spiral waves are typical patterns @xcite . as kuramoto showed ( as e.g. in @xcite ) , these dynamical systems can be well approximated by phase oscillators if the interaction is weak . for reaction - diffusion equations with a nonlinear interaction term he predicted circular waves with strong similarities to the experimental observation of target patterns . in these systems , defects or impurities",
    "seem to play the role of pacemakers , driving the system into a synchronized state .",
    "therefore he treated pacemakers as local `` defect '' terms leading to heterogeneities in the reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "in this paper we consider two types of pacemakers . in the first part they are introduced as `` defects '' in the sense that they have a different natural frequency from the rest of the system , whose oscillators have either exactly the same frequency or small random fluctuations about some common average by assumption , where in the second case the pacemaker s frequency is clearly different from the values of a typical fluctuation",
    "actually , we will not consider the latter case , since small fluctuations do not lead to any qualitative change .",
    "the ad - hoc distinction of the pacemaker may reflect natural and artificial systems with built - in impurities like those in the belousov - zhabotinsky system .",
    "we have recently studied these systems for nearest neighbor interactions @xcite and regular networks in @xmath0 dimensions for periodic and open boundary conditions . for such systems",
    "we have shown that it is the mean distance of all other nodes from the pacemaker ( the so - called depth of the network ) that determines its synchronizability .",
    "periodic boundary conditions facilitate synchronization as compared to open boundary conditions . here",
    "we extend these results to larger interaction range .",
    "the effect of an extended interaction range on oscillatory systems without pacemaker were considered in @xcite .",
    "we analytically derive the entrainment frequency for arbitrary interaction range between next - neighbor and all - to all interactions .",
    "we derive the entrainment window for all- to - all couplings analytically , for intermediate couplings numerically .",
    "the entrainment window depends non - monotonically on the interaction range , so that the synchronization transition is reentrant . in our system",
    "the reentrance can be explained in terms of the weight of the interaction term and the normalization of the coupling strength .    in the second part",
    "we consider a system of oscillators without a `` defect '' , all oscillators on the same footing up to the difference in their natural frequencies .",
    "an obvious choice for the natural frequencies would be a gaussian distribution or another random distribution to describe fluctuations in natural frequencies in otherwise homogeneous systems , without impurities .",
    "such systems have been studied by blasius and tnjes @xcite for a gaussian distribution .",
    "the authors showed that in this case an asymmetric interaction term is needed to have synchronization , this time driven by a dynamically established pacemaker , acting as a source of concentric waves .",
    "this result shows that conditions exist under which a system establishes its own pacemaker in a `` self - organized '' way .",
    "in contrast to the random distribution of natural frequencies we are interested in a ( deterministic ) gradient distribution , in which the natural frequencies linearly decrease over a certain region in space .",
    "such a deterministic gradient alone is probably not realistic for natural systems , but considered as a subsystem of a larger set of oscillators with natural frequency fluctuations it may be realized over a certain region in space .",
    "here we suppress the fluctuations and focus on the effect of the gradient alone . as it turns out ,",
    "the asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution is sufficient for creating a pacemaker as center of circular waves in oscillator - phase space , without the need for an asymmetric term in the interaction .",
    "the oscillator with the highest natural frequency becomes the source of circular waves in the synchronized system .",
    "we call it dynamically induced as its only inherent difference is its local maximum at the boundary in an otherwise `` smooth '' frequency distribution",
    ". the type of pattern created by the pacemaker has the familiar form of circular waves . beyond a critical slope in the natural frequencies ,",
    "full synchronization is lost .",
    "it is first replaced by partial synchronization patterns with bifurcation in the frequencies of synchronized clusters , before it gets completely lost for too steep slopes .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the first part we treat the pacemaker as defect and",
    "derive the common entrainment frequency for arbitrary interaction range and topology ( section [ sec.i ] ) .",
    "next we determine the entrainment window , analytically for all - to all coupling and numerically for intermediate interaction range ( section [ sec.i1 ] ) . here",
    "we see the reentrance of the transition as a function of the interaction range ( section [ sec.i2 ] ) . in the second part ( section [ sec.ii ] ) we consider dynamically induced pacemakers , first without asymmetric interaction term , for which we analytically derive the synchronization transition as a function of the gradient in the frequencies ( sections [ sec.ii1 ] ) . in section [ sec.ii2 ] we add an asymmetric term , so that the pattern formation is no longer surprising due to the results of @xcite , but the intermediate patterns of partial synchronization are different . in section [ sec.iv ]",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "the system is defined on a network , regular or small - world like . to each node @xmath1 , @xmath2 , we assign a limit - cycle oscillator , characterized merely by its phase @xmath3 , which follows the dynamics @xmath4 with the following notations .",

    "moreover , @xmath18 is the degree of the @xmath1-th node , it gives the total number of connections of this node in the network .",
    "this system was considered before in @xcite for nearest - neighbor interactions ( @xmath19 ) on a @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattice and on a cayley tree . here",
    "we extend the results to long - range interactions via @xmath20 .      in the appendix of @xcite we derived the common entrainment frequency @xmath21 in the phase - locked state , for which @xmath22 for all @xmath1 , to be given as @xmath23 in the rotated frame , in which the natural frequency @xmath5 is zero .",
    "in particular such a result is obtained directly from system ( [ def : model ] ) , applying the transformation to the rotating frame @xmath24 @xmath25 , multiplying the @xmath1-th equation by @xmath26 , summing over all equations and then using the fact that @xmath27 , because the symmetry of the adjacency matrix @xmath28 and the antisymmetry of the @xmath29-function .",
    "whenever @xmath30 is independent of @xmath1 as it happens for periodic boundary conditions and homogeneous degree distributions , in particular for @xmath31 ( all - to - all coupling ) , the common frequency ( in the non - rotated frame ) is given by @xmath32 independent on @xmath33 . in the limit @xmath34 the system synchronizes at @xmath5 .",
    "+ analytical results for the entrainment window were derived for open and periodic boundary conditions and @xmath35 in @xcite . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the result is the same as for @xmath36 , periodic boundary conditions and @xmath37 @xmath38 this is seen as follows .",
    "since for all - to - all couplings the mean - field approximation becomes exact , it is natural to rewrite the dynamical equations ( [ def : model ] ) in terms of the order parameter @xmath39 defined according to @xmath40 this quantity differs from the usual order parameter just by the fact that the sum runs over @xmath41 .",
    "eq.s([def : model ] ) then take the form @xmath42 using @xmath43 for all @xmath44 as one of the possible solutions and the fact that the @xmath29-function is bounded , these equations imply the entrainment window as given by ( [ eq : critic ] ) with @xmath45 the total number of nodes minus @xmath46 . as we have shown in @xcite ,",
    "the same dependence in terms of @xmath45 holds for a @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattice with @xmath47 nodes per side and nearest neighbor couplings , for which @xmath48 , so that the entrainment window for nearest neighbor interactions and on a regular lattice decays exponentially with the depth of the network in the limit of infinite dimensions @xmath0 ; for random and small - world networks the same type of decay was derived in @xcite .",
    "the intermediate interaction range @xmath49 can not be treated analytically . here",
    "the numerical integration of the equations ( [ def : model ] ) ( via a fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm with time step @xmath50 and homogeneous initial conditions ) shows that the entrainment window is even smaller than in the limiting cases @xmath31 or @xmath51 for otherwise unchanged parameters",
    "( that is fixed size @xmath45 , dimension @xmath0 , coupling @xmath52 ) . for these cases formula ( [ eq : critic ] ) gives an upper bound on the entrainment window , as one can easily see from eq.[def : model ] for @xmath53 because @xmath54 , @xmath55 . actually the entrainment window becomes smaller for intermediate interaction range , a feature leading to the reentrance of the synchronization transition as function of @xmath33 , as we shall see in the figures [ fig : reentalpha ] and [ fig : reentkandp ] below .",
    "reentrance phenomena are observed in a variety of phase transitions , ranging from superconductor - insulator transitions as function of temperature @xcite and noise - induced transitions @xcite to chaotic coupled - map lattices as function of the coupling @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a reentrance phenomenon is discussed as an artifact of the approximation .",
    "reentrance of phase transitions is challenging as long as it appears counterintuitive .",
    "for example , it is counterintuitive when synchronization is first facilitated for increasing coupling and later gets blocked when the coupling exceeds a certain threshold , so that synchronization depends non - monotonically on the coupling . as we see in fig .",

    "this contribution depends non - monotonically on @xmath33 , as @xmath57 decreases for increasing @xmath33 , while the coupling strength increases under the same change of @xmath33 , so that there is a competition between the two factors leading to a minimum of the weight for a certain value of @xmath33 . in contrast , if we scale the coupling strength by a constant factor @xmath58 , independently of the degree of the node @xmath1 , the overall weight of the sum decreases for increasing @xmath33 and along with this , the drive to the synchronized state . as it is shown in the inset of fig .",

    "the main qualitative feature , however , is in common to both systems with and without antisymmetric coupling : the oscillator with the highest natural frequency becomes the center of outgoing circular waves , it is dynamically established as pacemaker .",
    "the patterns , seen here in case of full and partial synchronization , are quite similar to those predicted by kuramoto @xcite for reaction - diffusion systems with continuous diffusion terms , and to those experimentally observed in chemical oscillatory systems @xcite .    .",

    "for the same system without a pacemaker , but with a gradient in the initial natural frequency distribution the oscillator with the highest natural frequency becomes the center of circular waves , its role as a pacemaker is dynamically induced without the need for an asymmetric term in the interaction . here",
    "we analytically determined the synchronization transition as function of the gradient slope . above some threshold , full synchronization on one or two - dimensional lattices",

    "for @xmath74 we observe a bifurcation in frequency space , for @xmath75 the one synchronized cluster shrinks in its size , before for even steeper slopes synchronization is completely lost . for artificial networks these results may be used to optimize the placement and the number of pacemakers if full synchronization is needed , or to control synchronization by tuning the slope of natural frequency gradients .",
