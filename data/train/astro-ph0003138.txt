    "the total flux density of the calibrator was found to be 9.5% less than was measured by the vla on the same day . given that the jet of j0509 + 1011 is likely to have some extended emission that is not detectable by the vlba , it is likely that the absolute flux calibration of the vlba is well within its nominal value of 5% .",

    "gain calibration used the quasar 0528@xmath13134 , while observations of uranus and 3c  454.3 provided the flux density calibration scale with an estimated uncertainty of @xmath14% . see shepherd et al .",

    "( 1999 ) for details of data reduction .",

    "in figure [ fig : lc - lcurve ] we display the 8.46 ghz light curve , as well as the x - ray and optical ( r - band ) light curves obtained from measurements reported in the grb coordinates network ( gcn ) and halpern et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . a noise - weighted least squares fit of the form @xmath17 was made to each of these light curves . using all the 8.46 ghz data , including the upper limits",
    ", we derive @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ; here @xmath20 is the reduced @xmath21 ) .    a similar least squares fit of the optical and x - ray data over the first three days ( figure [ fig : lc - lcurve ] ) , yields @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) . from a more extensive dataset , halpern et al .",
    "( 2000 ) fit @xmath26 over the same time range .",
    "we will use their value of @xmath27 in the discussion to follow .",
    "the relatively large value of @xmath20 for fit to the x - ray data presumably reflects the uncertainties inherent in converting the counts measured by three different instruments ( rxte - asm , rxte - pca and chandra acis ) into jansky flux units .",
    "using the rxte - pca data alone avoids this cross - calibration issue and yields @xmath28 .",
    "the radio afterglow from  is unusual on two counts .",
    "first , the radio afterglow in the centimeter band does not show the usual rise to a peak value @xmath29 ( at epoch @xmath30 ) before undergoing a power law decay .",
    "the radio flux appears to decline continuously starting from the epoch of the first observation .",
    "thus @xmath31 d as compared to the 10100 d seen in other bursts ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "second , the temporal decay indices ( @xmath32 ) in the radio , optical and x - ray bands are markedly different from each other . proceeding from radio to higher frequencies , @xmath33 steepens by @xmath340.4 every four decades in frequency .    in contrast , the optical and x - ray afterglow appears to find a straightforward explanation in the standard afterglow model in which a jet geometry is invoked ( @xcite ) .",
    "below we show that the radio observations can not be reconciled with a standard jet ( or sphere ) afterglow model .",
    "we then explore possible modifications to the standard model .",
    "the simplest afterglow model is one in which the broad - band afterglow emission arises from the forward shock of a relativistic blast wave propagating into a constant density medium ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is assumed that the electrons in the forward shock region are accelerated to a power law distribution for @xmath35 , @xmath36 ; here @xmath37 is the lorentz factor of the electrons , @xmath38 is the power law index and @xmath39 is the minimum lorentz factor .",
    "gyration of these electrons in strong post - shocked magnetic fields gives rise to broad - band afterglow emission .",
    "two modifications to this picture are routinely considered .",
    "( 1 ) an inhomogeneous circumburst medium ( specifically , @xmath40 ; here @xmath41 is the density at distance @xmath42 from the source ) .",
    "such a circumburst medium is expected should grbs originate from massive stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "( 2 ) a jet - like geometry for the blast wave ( @xcite ) .",
    "this modification is motivated by the propensity of jets in astrophysical sources .",
    "regardless of these modifications , the broad band spectrum is composed of three characteristic frequencies : @xmath43 , the synchrotron self - absorption frequency ; @xmath44 , the frequency at which the emission peaks ( and attributed to the electrons with lorentz factor @xmath39 ) , and @xmath45 , the cooling frequency .",
    "electrons radiating photons with frequency @xmath46 cool on timescales faster than the age of the blast wave .",
    "the evolution of these frequencies is determined by the dynamics of the blast wave .",
    "the usual ordering of these frequencies at epochs relevant to the discussion here is ( going from low to high frequencies ) @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    for  the early radio decay",
    "implies that @xmath44 is already below the centimeter radio band at 1.49 days .",
    "the steepening of the afterglow emission from optical to x - ray can be explained by placing @xmath45 between the optical and x - ray bands .",
    "the expected steeping @xmath47 is 1/4 which is marginally consistent with @xmath48 .",
    "however , even if we ignore this , we are simply unable to explain the decay in the radio band , since no additional steepening is expected between @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    ".    the standard afterglow model can be made to agree with the light curves by postulating an energy slope @xmath38 which gradually steepens with increasing electron energy @xmath37 .",
    "we use the spherical , constant density afterglow model ( @xcite ) to convert , in each band , the observed decay index to @xmath38 and obtain : @xmath49 ( radio ) , @xmath50 ( optical ) , and @xmath51 ( if @xmath45 is below the x - ray band ) or @xmath52 ( if @xmath45 above the x - ray band ) .",
    "we are justified in applying the spherical model for early times ( @xmath53 25 d ) since the jet geometry is manifested only for @xmath54 ( @xcite ) .",
    "curvature is both observed and modeled in the synchrotron spectra of the non - relativistic shocks from supernova remnants which are accelerating cosmic rays ( e.g. baring et al .",
    "1999 ) . to date",
    ", models of ultra - relativistic shocks favor a universal value of @xmath38 , independent of energy ( @xcite , @xcite ) , but non - linear effects have yet to be treated .",
    "nonetheless , the invocation of curvature in the energy distribution of the electrons can not explain the observed broad - band spectrum ( figure  [ fig : broadband ] ) of the afterglow on december 18 ( corresponding to 1.33 days after the burst ) .",
    "a plausible fit to the entire data is obtained with @xmath55   ghz , @xmath56  ghz and @xmath57  hz and @xmath58 mjy ; this fit is displayed by the dashed line in figure  [ fig : broadband ] . as the blast wave slows down , @xmath44 moves to lower values while preserving @xmath29 and",
    "thus we expect the flux in the centimeter band to rise , whereas the observed flux falls .",
    "if the afterglow has a jet - like geometry then the radio afterglow is expected to rise until the epoch @xmath59 , and subsequently decay very slowly ( @xmath60 ) until @xmath44 passes through the centimeter band , after which we expect to see a decline similar to that seen in the optical ( @xmath61 ) ( @xcite ) . as can be seen from figure  [ fig : broadband ] ,",
    "the radio observations are grossly inconsistent with these expectations , particularly the decay is much faster than @xmath62 .    to summarize , while the optical and x - ray observations can be accounted for by a jet model , the radio observations are inconsistent with the standard model .",
    "this forces us to consider afterglow models in which the radio emission ( at least in bulk ) arises from a source other than the usual forward shock .",
    "the most natural explanation for two components would be an early contribution from a reverse shock followed by a forward shock element at later times .",
    "this is the explanation invoked to account for the early ( 1 - 2 day ) radio emission from the afterglow of grb ( @xcite , @xcite but see @xcite ) .",
    "the two bursts share several common features : in both cases , a jet has been deduced with @xmath63 few days , both were quite bright at gamma - ray energies and finally both had a seemingly small value of @xmath30 ( as measured in the centimeter band ) .",
    "however , in the case of grb , the peak flux of the forward shock was @xmath64jy ( @xcite ) and the radio light curve was dominated by the reverse shock . in contrast , the forward shock for  appears to be quite strong .",
    "this difference then explains the seemingly different radio light curves .    at late times ( i.e. timescales greater than the duration of the burst ) the flux from the reverse shock",
    "is expected to fall as @xmath65 ( @xcite ) . in contrast , the forward shock emission rises as @xmath66 for @xmath67 and then slowly decays , @xmath68 until the @xmath44 moves into the centimeter band .",
    "since @xmath59 is known from optical observations ( @xcite ) , the remaining unknowns are the strength of the reverse and forward shock emission .    in this picture , the reverse shock dominates the radio emission for the first few days and the model fit consists of mainly fitting a power law with @xmath69 .",
    "we note that at day 1.5 , the vla 8.46 ghz flux and the ryle 15 ghz flux are comparable .",
    "this suggests that the reverse shock is already optically thin at 8.46 ghz at this epoch ",
    "similar to the situation for grb 990123 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we deduce the parameters of the forward shock by fitting the radio to optical spectrum around @xmath59=5 days to the forward shock model ( the contribution of the reverse shock is expected to be negligible thanks to the steep decay and since @xmath70 is comparable to @xmath59 , the spherical fireball model is still applicable ) ; we find @xmath71 hz and @xmath72 mjy .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : r - fmodel ] this reverse - forward model provides a reasonable fit to the observations .",
    "there are two predictions of this model .",
    "first , we expect @xmath44 to cross the centimeter band at @xmath73 d. for @xmath74 , we expect the radio flux to decline as steeply as the optical flux does for @xmath54 . the low flux values as measured at the vla around this epoch are in agreement with this model .",
    "a second prediction is that for @xmath75 , we expect , the spectrum to rise as @xmath76 for @xmath77 ghz . unfortunately , the data are too sparse to rigorously test this expectation .",
    "nonetheless , we note that at day 17.44 , the spectrum between 1.43 and 8.46 ghz can be described by a simple power - law with slope @xmath78 , steeper than a @xmath76 slope by 3.6@xmath11 .",
    "we consider this to be the weakest point of the model but do not consider it fatal since the quoted uncertainties include only instrumental errors and do not include external effects such as interstellar scintillation .",
    "the strongest confirmation of this model would have been the detection of an optical flash , as in the case of grb 990123 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the strong radio emission from the reverse shock allows us to predict ( by scaling from the optical and radio observations of grb 990123 , @xcite ) that the flash would have been 8th magnitude or even brighter .",
    "unfortunately , this event occurred during daytime and therefore was not observed by existing prompt optical counterpart experiments ( lotis  h. s. park ; roste  c. akerlof ; _ pers .",
    "_ )    we end this section by noting a worrisome and puzzling issue : we are unable to provide a consistent explanation for the near - ir , optical and x - ray observations with a standard fireball afterglow spectrum .",
    "as noted in figure  [ fig : broadband ] , there is a broad maximum around @xmath79 hz  suggesting that this is the peak frequency ( @xmath44 ) of the fireball . fitting a template afterglow spectrum",
    "we obtain the following : @xmath80 hz , @xmath81 @xmath82jy and @xmath83 hz .",
    "we note that a similar broad peak in the near ir ( and attributed to @xmath84 hz at @xmath85 d ) was observed for grb 971214 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , if we evolve this @xmath44 back in time ( with @xmath86 ) we predict a _ rising _ r - band light curve , inconsistent with the observations ( figure [ fig : lc - lcurve ] ) . moving @xmath44 to lower frequencies solves this problem but we are left with no explanation for the `` near - ir '' bump .",
    "we now consider a model in which much of the radio emission arises as the forward shock of an additional fireball ( hereafter the second fireball ) .",
    "the principal attraction of the second fireball is that we no longer need to relate the radio decay rate to those at optical and radio frequencies .",
    "we clarify that the optical and x - ray observations are explained by the forward shock of the fireball ( the first fireball ) discussed in the previous section . as noted earlier ,",
    "there is good evidence suggesting that the first fireball is a jet .",
    "thus the second fireball must be a more isotropic fireball and move at a smaller lorentz factor .",
    "indeed , in some grb models , the central engine is expected to inject two fireballs : a high @xmath87 jet and a low @xmath87 spherical wind .",
    "a reasonable fit to the radio data of this second fireball ( fs 2 ; see figure  [ fig : broadband ] ) on day 1.33 is provided by @xmath88 mjy , @xmath89=7 ghz , and @xmath90=2 ghz .",
    "the location of the cooling frequency @xmath91 is unconstrained . as a test",
    ", we evolved the afterglow spectrum forward in time .",
    "the model does an excellent job reproducing the declining flux density from 1.43 and 8.46 ghz at 17.44 days ( an observation which the reverse - forward shock model fails to explain ) , but at day 60.40 it predicts a 1.43 ghz flux of @xmath92 @xmath82jy , where only an upper limit of @xmath93 @xmath82jy is measured .",
    "again we consider this 3-@xmath11 discrepancy as a major , but not fatal , weakness of this model .",
    "the three inferred parameters ( @xmath89 , @xmath94 , @xmath90 ) allow us to obtain the energy of the blast wave and the density of the ambient medium ( @xcite ) : @xmath95 erg and @xmath96 @xmath2 ; these values are relatively insensitive to the value of the unknown @xmath45 ( which is however constrained to lie above the optical band )",
    ". the large @xmath97 and small @xmath98 are primarily due to the small value of @xmath30 .",
    "if this interpretation is correct then we have uncovered the first example of a grb exploding in a very low density medium  perhaps the halo of a host galaxy .",
    "the dynamics of explosions is governed by the ratio @xmath99 , and as noted above , this ratio is perhaps @xmath100 larger than that typically derived in other afterglow .",
    "for this reason , both fireballs , the high @xmath87 and the low @xmath87 fireballs , would then be expanding at high lorentz factors days after the burst .",
    "the @xmath87 for the low @xmath87 fireball would be an impressive 20 one day after the burst , and the fireball would have had a size of 100 microarcseconds three weeks after the burst  almost within reach of measurable with vlbi techniques ( cf .",
    "the jet fireball would be expanding even faster in which case the opening angle of the jet is not 6@xmath101 ( @xcite ) but only 1@xmath101 .    to summarize , the radio afterglow of  is unusual and can not be explained by the standard forward shock model . a conventional reverse - forward shock model or an exotic two - component forward shock model can account for the observations , but each has one major ( but not necessarily fatal ) weakness .",
    "finally , we have no explanation for the near - ir bump seen on day 1.33 .",
    "shows that there may be yet new surprises in grb afterglows .",
    "daf thanks chris fassnacht , steve myers , lin yan and jim ulvestad for generously giving up portions of their vla time so that grb could be observed .",
    "daf thanks j. halpern for making his paper available prior to publication and y. gallant and m. vietri for useful discussions .",
    "we would like to thank s.  jogee for preparing the first observations of this burst at the owens valley observatory and a. sargent for generously allocating the time on short notice .",
