    "in a simplistic view , the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) is due to collective oscillations between protons and neutrons under the influence of the electromagnetic field induced by the emitted / absorbed photons , which results in a large peak in the emission / absorption spectrum of @xmath1-rays .",
    "this fundamental mode of nuclear collective excitation can be built on any state and hence gdr can probe the structure of the nucleus even at finite temperature ( @xmath2 ) and angular momentum ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .    in a macroscopic theoretical description of gdr ,",
    "the gdr observables are coupled with the shape degrees of freedom . since the nucleus is a tiny system , the thermal fluctuations are more dominant . in the thermal shape fluctuation model ( tsfm ) ,",
    "the gdr observables are obtained as the average over all the possible shapes of the nucleus @xcite . in most of such models ,",
    "the probability of finding the nucleus with a given shape is given in terms of the free energy calculated in a microscopic - macroscopic approach .    in a microscopic way , the gdr can be explained in terms of particle - hole , particle - particle and hole - hole excitations @xcite .",
    "one such approach is the phonon damping model which has been proved to be quite successful in explaining the measured gdr widths ( @xmath4 ) as a function of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "recently , these calculations are extended to include the angular momentum for non - collective rotations @xcite . in another microscopic approach ,",
    "the gdr in hot and rotating nuclei were studied within the frame work of linear response theory along with static path approximation to the grand canonical partition function @xcite .",
    "most of the other microscopic approaches for gdr @xcite are not extended to hot and rotating nuclei .",
    "apart from the theoretical models , phenomenological formulae were also introduced to explain the global properties of @xmath4 @xcite in hot and rotating nuclei .",
    "these formulae are constructed to fit the experimental @xmath4 .",
    "the results of these phenomenological formulae are similar to those of the tsfm in some cases .    despite a number of experiments",
    "been carried out to understand the properties of gdr and the effect of @xmath2 and @xmath3 on gdr @xcite , still there are several open questions . by large ,",
    "the measured @xmath4 are well interpreted by tsfm calculations , and the phenomenological scaling formula ( psf ) @xcite description also was successful in many cases .",
    "the failure of psf and tsfm at low-@xmath2 is recently analyzed @xcite and the psf is modified suitably , leading to a critical temperature formula ( ctf ) which overcomes the discrepancies at low-@xmath2 .",
    "the microscopic origin of such discrepancy is quite known @xcite to be due to pairing and extension of the tsfm to include pairing proved that tsfm is quite successful at low-@xmath2 also @xcite .",
    "another case where the psf was observed to be insufficient to explain the measured @xmath4 is the hot and rotating nucleus @xmath0gd .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the psf could not explain the @xmath4 measured at two excitation energies with a single value for the parameter of the psf ( reduced width , @xmath5 ) .",
    "this work highlighted the need for performing proper tsfm calculations specifically for this system to understand the gdr properties .",
    "the ctf was demonstrated @xcite to be successful and the discrepancy with the psf was attributed to the role of gdr induced quadrupole moment @xcite .",
    "this argument was generalized to tsfm based on the fact that the psf mostly mimics the results of tsfm .",

    "we employ the tsfm built on nilsson - strutinsky ( ns ) calculations with a macroscopic approach to gdr .",

    "[ 2006gdr ] .",
    "the tsfm calculations are carried out with two different values for the dipole - dipole interaction parameter @xmath39 .",
    "the value of @xmath39 as @xmath47 is chosen by fitting the experimental cross sections . in this case",
    ", we have a good agreement between the experimental and theoretical gdr cross sections represented by the solid lines .",
    "however , as shown in table  [ table1 ] , the corresponding tsfm gdr widths ( @xmath48 ) are smaller than the experimental gdr widths ( @xmath49 ) . on a careful examination of the cross sections , shown in fig",
    ".  [ 2006gdr ] , we can note that the experimental data in the higher energy side around the half maximum is quite scattered in most of the cases .",
    "due to this scattered data , the fitting of smooth curves ( two component lorentzian ) will carry large errors as reported in ref .",
    "these experimental cross sections , with large errors in the higher energies , tend to yield an overestimated width .",
    "a perfect fit to the gdr cross sections could be possible with a fragmented gdr spectrum . in a microscopic approach",
    ", there can be numerous components of gdr corresponding to various combinations of particle - hole ( @xmath50 ) , particle - particle ( @xmath51 ) , and hole - hole ( @xmath52 ) excitations @xcite .",
    "the strength functions for these components can be calculated microscopically but the width is rather artificially introduced .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite one can see a fragmented gdr for @xmath53sn ( fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) with a protruding component around @xmath54 mev . restricting the coupling to @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 configurations via the doorways can lead to a different scenario ( fig .  5 of ref .",
    "these variations can be understood in terms of the choice of doorway configurations but it is rather difficult to associate a simple physical process . in a macroscopic approach ,",
    "the picture of splitting of gdr components is quite vivid in terms of the deformation and the coriolis effects leading to a maximum of five components @xcite . even after considering all these effects ,",
    "our model does not yield such a fragmented gdr consistent with the experimental data .",
    "the temperatures corresponding to the observations are sufficiently high so that the macroscopic approach is good enough .",
    "the fit achieved for cross sections by our calculations are quite reasonable considering the uncertainties in the data .",
    "hence , the discrepancy in matching the width as shown in table  [ table1 ] , shall be attributed to the inaccuracy in experimental cross sections . in other words , with large uncertainties in cross sections , it could be inappropriate to rely on @xmath49 for comparison with the theory . this fact is exemplified by our calculations with @xmath55 which fits the @xmath49 in a better way as shown in the last column of table  [ table1 ] .",

[ 2010pes ] , the fes corresponding to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 combinations extracted from the data measured at @xmath46 mev .",

    "consequently , we observe that some interesting shape effects like the @xmath1-softness and the shape transitions , as depicted by the fes , are not effectively reflected in the corresponding @xmath4 .",
