    "analysis of time series with nonlinear long - range correlations is often grounded on a study of their multifractal structure  @xcite .",
    "existing algorithms used in such an analysis allow for determining generalized fractal dimensions or hlder exponents based either on statistical properties of time series  @xcite or on time - frequency information  @xcite .",
    "because of implementation simplicity and their utility , these algorithms have already been applied to characterize correlation structure of data in various areas of science like physics  @xcite , biology  @xcite , chemistry  @xcite , geophysics  @xcite , economics  @xcite , hydrology  @xcite , atmospheric physics  @xcite , quantitative linguistics  @xcite , music  @xcite , and human communications  @xcite . as an important step towards quantifying complexity , in recent years",
    "algorithms designed for investigation of fractal cross - correlations were proposed  @xcite followed by the new statistical cross - correlation tests  @xcite .",
    "these developments are based on the detrended cross - correlation analysis ( dcca ) which constitutes a straightforward generalization of the fractal auto - correlation ( dfa )  @xcite on the case of fractally cross - correlated signals . in that case , the cross - correlation scaling exponent @xmath1 can be obtained .",
    "however , literature still lacks comprehensive interpretation of this quantity .",
    "subsequently , the multifractal extension ( mf - dxa ) of the dcca method was proposed  @xcite . other closely related methods to deal with multifractal cross - correlations",
    "have also been introduced  @xcite .",
    "however , these extensions naturally involve computation of arbitrary powers of cross - covariances and this leads to serious limitations since such cross - covariances may , in general , become negative .",
    "in such a case the net result , expressed in terms of the usual fluctuation functions , thus becomes complex - valued which does not allow to determine the scaling exponents by conventional means .",
    "a simplistic resolution , so far available in the literature , to this difficulty is based on taking modulus  @xcite of the cross - covariance function in order to get rid of its negative signs . in most realistic cases , as our analysis below shows , this however seriously distorts or even spuriously amplifies the multifractal cross - correlation measures .",
    "our motivation therefore is to elaborate an algorithm that we call multifractal cross - correlation analysis ( mfcca ) , such that for any two signals it allows to compute their arbitrary - order covariance function and at the same time it properly takes care of the relative signs in the signals .",
    "the proposed method allows us to calculate the spectrum of the exponents @xmath0 , which characterize multifractal properties of the cross - covariance .",
    "however , unlike the method proposed ealier , in our procedure , the scaling properties of the @xmath2th order cross - covariance function are estimated with respect to the original sign of the cross - covariance .",
    "this procedure makes the method both more sensitive to cross - correlation structure and free from limitations of other algorithms",
    ". it also turns out that the proposed method is a more natural generalization of the monofractal dcca than is mf - dxa .",
    "the robustness of our algorithm makes it applicable to different data types in various fields of science .",
    "multifractal cross - correlation analysis consists of several steps which are described in detail below .",
    "as it was mentioned above , mfcca has been developed based on the dcca procedure @xcite , therefore the initial steps are the same .",
    "consider two time series @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 . at first , the signal profile has to be calculated for each of them : @xmath6 , \\quad y\\left(j\\right ) = \\sum_{i=1}^j[y_{i}-\\langle y\\rangle].\\ ] ] here , @xmath7 denotes averaging over entire time series .",
    "then , both signal profiles are divided into @xmath8 disjoint segments @xmath9 of length @xmath10 . for each box @xmath9 ,",
    "the assumed trend is estimated by fitting a polynomial of order @xmath11 ( @xmath12 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 ) . based on our own experience  @xcite , as optimal we use a polynomial of order @xmath16 throughout this paper but the proposed procedure",
    "is not restricted to this particular order and can be used for much larger one when needed ( as , for instance , in signals involving a highly periodic component  @xcite ) .",
    "next , the trend is subtracted from the data and the detrended cross - covariance within each box is calculated : @xmath17 in contrast to the detrended variance calculated in the mfdfa procedure  @xcite , in the present case , @xmath18 can take both positive and negative values ( for an example see sec .",
    "[ stocks ] fig.[fig12 ] ) .",
    "therefore , gradual investigation of scaling properties from small to large fluctuations through their covariances of increasing order should take into account also sign of @xmath18 .",
    "accordingly , the most natural form of the @xmath2th order covariance function is postulated by the following equation : @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the sign of @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 can take any real number except zero .",
    "however , for @xmath21 , the logarithmic version of eq .",
    "( [ fq ] ) can be employed  @xcite : @xmath22 as we can see in eq .",
    "( [ fq ] ) , for negative values of @xmath2 , small values of the covariance function @xmath18 are amplified , while for large @xmath23 , its large values dominate .",
    "moreover , the formula for calculating @xmath24 respects the genuine signs of the amplified ( or supressed ) fluctuations of the detrended cross - covariance function ( eq .  ( [ fxy2 ] ) ) and , at the same time , it allows to avoid complex numbers associated with the arbitrary powers of negative fluctuations .",
    "the above described steps of mfcca should be repeated for different scales @xmath10 . if the so - obtained function @xmath24 does not develop scaling , by for instance fluctuating around zero ,",
    "there is no fractal cross - correlation between the time series under study for the considered value of @xmath2 .",
    "multifractal cross - correlation is expected to manifest itself in the power - law dependence of @xmath24 ( if the @xmath2th order covariance function is negative for every @xmath10 , we may take @xmath25  @xcite ) and the following relation is fulfilled : @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 for @xmath21 ) , where @xmath0 is an exponent that quantitatively characterizes fractal properties of the cross - covariance . for the monofractal cross - correlation ,",
    "the exponents @xmath28 are independent of @xmath2 and equal to @xmath1 as obtained from the dcca method . in the case of multifractal cross - correlation",
    ", however , @xmath28 varies with @xmath2 , with @xmath1 retrieved for @xmath29 .",
    "the minimum and maximum scales ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively ) depend on the length @xmath32 of the time series under study . in practice , it is reasonable to take @xmath33 .",
    "in order to verify the usefulness of mfcca algorithm , we test it by using both artificially generated cross - correlated time series and real - world signals . in order to avoid divergent moments due to fat tails in the distribution of fluctuations , we restrict @xmath2 to @xmath34 with a step @xmath35 throughout this paper . in the case of computer - generated signals , results for each process",
    "are averaged over its 20 independent realizations .",
    "we start our study from an analysis of the well - known arfima processes  @xcite , which are examples of monofractal , long - range correlated signals . in ref .",
    "@xcite , such processes were used to show usefulness of the dcca algorithm .",
    "our goal is to show the cross - correlation structure of the above - mentioned processes more completely . to generate a pair ( @xmath36 ) of the cross - correlated arfima processes , we use the following equations : @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are parameters characterizing linear long - range autocorrelations of the times series .",
    "these quantities can be related to the hurst exponents  @xcite by the relation @xmath41 , ( @xmath42 ) . positively correlated",
    "( persistent ) time series are characterized by @xmath43 , whereas negative autocorrelation ( antipersistent signal ) is characterized by @xmath44 ; h=0.5 means no linear autocorrelation .",

    "@xmath48 is an i.i.d .",
    "gaussian random variable .",
    "the processes @xmath3 and @xmath4 are cross - correlated , because the same noise component @xmath48 is used in both eq.([x ] ) and eq.([y ] ) .",
    "we generate three pairs of cross - correlated signals : ( @xmath49=0.5 , @xmath50=0.6 ) , ( @xmath49=0.5 , @xmath50=0.7 ) , and ( @xmath49=0.5 , @xmath50=0.9 ) , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 characterize long - range autocorrelation of the first and the second time series , respectively . in order to obtain statistically significant results ,",
    "we generate time series of lengh @xmath51 points each .    in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we present the calculated @xmath52 for all the signal pairs .",
    "each line corresponds to a different value of @xmath2 .",
    "as it can be seen , in all the cases , @xmath52 is a power function of scale @xmath10 .",
    "this indicates the fractal nature of the cross - correlations .",
    "moreover , for all types of signals , the functions @xmath52 are almost parallel to each other implying largely homogeneous character of the corresponding cross - correlations . indeed , as shown in the right panels of the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the difference between the extreme values of @xmath0 expressed by @xmath53 is approximately 0.005 , 0.007 , and 0.011 for the top , middle , and the bottom panel , respectively .",
    "these narrow ranges of @xmath0 indicate that the arfima processes reveal correlations that are monofractal regardless of the types of linear autocorrelation of signals .    in literature ,",
    "the estimated fractal cross - correlations are often related to the fractal properties of the individual signals themselves  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    ", we also show the average of the generalized hurst exponents  @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 refer to fractal properies of individual time series , respectively and , for @xmath29 , they correspond to the hurst exponent @xmath57 .",
    "it is worth noticing that relation between @xmath0 and @xmath58 depends on temporal organization of the signals as determined by their hurst exponents . for two signals",
    "whose hurst exponents @xmath57 are alike , their multifractal cross - correlation characteristics described by @xmath0 and @xmath58 are almost identical , while the divergence between @xmath0 and @xmath58 becames more sizeble for time series with more significant differences in autocorrelation ( different hurst exponent @xmath57 ) .",
    "this result means that , in the case of the arfima processes , the relation @xmath59 introduced in ref .  @xcite applies only to a situation when differences between @xmath60 and @xmath61 are negligible .      as an example of multfractal process",
    ", we consider the markov - switching multifractal model ( msm )  @xcite .",
    "msm is an iterative model , which is able to replicate hierarchical , multiplicative structure of real data and , thus , insures multifractal properties of the generated time series . because of its properties , msm is commonly used in finance , where multifractality of price fluctuations is one of the main stylized facts  @xcite .",
    "equally well this model can be used to simulate many other multifractal time series representing natural phenomena as it is able to generate the volatility clustering responsible for the underlying nonlinear temporal correlations  @xcite .",
    "below , we present the main stages of the model s construction .    in msm , evolution of an observable @xmath62 in time @xmath63 is modeled by the formula  @xcite : @xmath64 where @xmath65 stands for a gaussian random variable and @xmath66 ( multifractal process ) stands for the instantaneous volatility component .",
    "the volatility @xmath66 is a product of @xmath67 multipliers @xmath68 such that @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a constant factor .",
    "a common version of the model assumes that the multipliers @xmath71 are drawn from the binomial or from the log - normal distribution . here",
    ", we use the binomial one with @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "any change of a multiplier in the hierarchical structure of volatility is determined by the transition probabilities  @xcite : @xmath74 thus , a multiplier @xmath71 is renewed with probability @xmath75 and remains unchanged with probability @xmath76 .",
    "the parameter @xmath77 is taken from the range @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "we put @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which leads to the relation : @xmath82 thus , for the initial stages of the cascade , a renewal of the multipliers @xmath71 occurs with relatively small probability , while the largest @xmath83 appears for @xmath84 .",
    "for the purpose of this analysis , we generate a set of multifractal time series ( @xmath66 ) of length @xmath85 points each .",
    "however , in all realizations of the model , we conserve the hierarchical structure of the multipliers , since the renewals of @xmath71 appear for the same @xmath86 and @xmath63 in each generated series .",
    "this procedure insures cross - correlations between series with different @xmath87 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we present sample results of mfcca obtained for two pairs of msm series with the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( top panels ) and @xmath88 and @xmath90 ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the @xmath2th - order covariance functions @xmath52 ( left hand side of this figure ) display a clear multifractal scaling within the whole range @xmath91 of the @xmath2 values .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 is a decreasing function of @xmath2 , which is a hallmark of multifractality .",
    "moreover , the rate of decrease of @xmath0 depends on the values of mutlipliers . for the first pair of signals ( with @xmath89 ) , the exponents @xmath0 are contained in the range ( 0.81,1.25 ) , while for the second pair ( with @xmath90 ) , @xmath92 . in the same fig .",

    "the multifractal characteristics were possible to estimate only for @xmath102 . in the case of @xmath103",
    ", @xmath104 takes both positive and negative values and eq.([fxy ] ) is not satisfied . at first , we focus on the relationship between @xmath105 and the average hurst exponent @xmath106 . in the inset of fig .",

    "we calculate also the difference between these two quantities which is shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "as one can see , @xmath111 is an increasing function of @xmath107 .",
    "this result indicates that the difference between @xmath1 and the average hurst exponent becomes larger for time series whose multifractal characteristics depart more from each other , while the opposite is observed when these characteristics are alike , which at the same time results in stronger cross - correlations .",

    "the related dependencies are even more involved and appear to strongly vary with the parameter @xmath2 as it is more systematically shown in fig .  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the @xmath125 is seen to be positive for @xmath126 with an increasing value at maximum with increasing @xmath107 , and a larger amplitude of changes with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "similar , but reversed in sign and with an even larger amplitude of changes , is the situation for @xmath127 .",
    "these results nicely coincide - and thus point to their origin - with those presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where @xmath0 is larger than @xmath58 for positive values of @xmath2 and smaller for negative ones .",
    "even the maxima of these differences occur for those values of @xmath2 , where they are seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and they are larger on the negative side of @xmath2 .",
    "of course , they are also larger for larger @xmath107 .",
    "the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath58 has its reflection - also consistent with the findings presented in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig6 ] - in another popular multifractal measure , namely in the range of scaling exponents . in fig .",

    "the @xmath132 and @xmath128 are seen to be monotonically increasing functions of @xmath107 in all the cases .",
    "however , for @xmath133 these characteristics are almost the same , while for @xmath129 the difference between @xmath134 and @xmath128 systematically increases with @xmath107 .",
    "this suggests that for relatively large values of @xmath135 ( magnifying the largest and the smallest fluctuations of instantaneous volatility components ) the fractal character of the considered processes is similar , which may reflect the effect of preserving the same hierarchical structure of multipliers for all generated multifractals , where only relative changes of volatility are possible .",
    "the above results thus indicate that the difference between @xmath58 and @xmath0 is to be considered an important ingredient of measure of the fractal cross - correlation between two time series .      in the next stage of our study of",
    "the msm generated @xmath66 time series , we analyze output of mfcca if one time series of a pair is gradually being shifted in time with respect to the other one . then the correlations , especially their fractal character , should undergo an obvious weakening .",
    "this test is aimed at further verifying performance of the algorithm .",
    "as an input , we use a time series with @xmath136 and the same one , but shifted by a certain number of points .",
    "we notice that the larger is the relative shift between the time series , the shorter is the scaling range of @xmath137 .",
    "however , in all cases , the estimated @xmath1 is equal to the generalized hurst exponent calculated for a single series .",
    "this shortening of the range of scaling is not symmetric from both sides of the scale range , but gradually arrives entirely from the small scale side .",
    "the shift dependence of the lower bound of the scaling regime that can be used to determine @xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "as expected , lifting of this lower bound is seen to be almost linear . in the same figure",
    ", we also present the result of an analogous analysis , but performed by means of the common variant of the mf - dxa procedure that , in order to resolve the sign problem , makes use of the absolute values of the fluctuation functions  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the procedure is seen not to be sensitive to this type of surrogate and , thus , evidently generates spurious cross - correlations .    in order to elaborate more in detail on this last issue",
    ", we generate an example of a pair of the msm time series with @xmath136 drawn independently , i.e. , with no taking care about preserving the hierarchical structure of the multipliers .",

    "an example of @xmath138 demonstrating this behavior is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "in fact , this dependence closely resembles the dcca result ( fig .",
    "1b in ref .",
    "@xcite ) obtained in an analogous situation of the two uncorrelated series .",
    "this correspondence thus provides an additional argument that it is mfcca proposed here that constitutes a natural and correct multifractal generalization of dcca .",
    "application of a previously postulated  @xcite extension of dcca in the present example would lead to complex - valued @xmath2th - order covariances .",
    "as already mentioned in introduction , a commonly adopted resolution to this difficulty is based on taking modulus of the cross - covariance before computing its @xmath2th order .",
    "the result of such a procedure applied to our example of two independently generated msm time series with @xmath136 is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] and it clearly indicates a convincing multifractal scaling .",
    "this , of course , is however a false signal as these series are not expected to be multifractally correlated .",
    "the time series of @xmath66 considered above represent unsigned fluctuations ( volatility in financial terms ) and therefore their individual hurst exponents are significantly larger than 0.5 . by incorporating the gaussian random variable @xmath65 drawn from @xmath139 through the eq .",
    "( [ msm ] ) , one obtains the signed time series @xmath62 with the hurst exponents close to 0.5 ( as for the financial returns , for instance ) .",

    "sign clearly shifts the lines down relative to the unsigned case , such that the usual hurst exponent @xmath145 assumes value of @xmath146 for all the signed series .",
    "the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath142 , naturally stronger for larger @xmath87 , remains however essentially preserved after introducing the sign , which reflects the fact that such an operation influences primarily the linear temporal correlations in the series leaving the nonlinear ones , related to the volatility clustering  @xcite , preserved .",
    "as far as multifractal cross - correlations between such series are concerned , more care is needed .",
    "drawing the term @xmath65 in eq .",

    "the departures between @xmath0 and @xmath58 for the other pair ( @xmath136 and @xmath148 ) of the signed series can be seen to be somewhat larger relative to their unsigned counterparts , which signals slight weakening of their multifractal cross - correlations .",

    "it is worth stressing that this difficulty does not affect the fractal analysis of individual time series ( mfdfa ) , because then the detrended variance function @xmath162 may only be positive .",
    "it follows that proper handling of the sign of @xmath161 is of crucial importance for a consistent extension of dcca to treat the multifractally correlated signals . at present , a solution of this problem is offered only by the mfcca algorithm proposed in sec .",
    "[ method ] .    in order to characterize the cross - correlations in the present case ,",
    "the function @xmath52 is calculated . as far as the multifractal scaling",
    "is concerned , the situation is significantly more subtle than in the previous model cases .",
    "it turns out that the scaling property of @xmath52 applies only selectively .",
    "first of all , for the negative @xmath2s , @xmath163 fluctuates around zero and eq .",
    "( [ fxy ] ) is not satisfied . for positive values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the function @xmath163 assumes positive values but clear scaling of @xmath52 begins with @xmath164 upwards . for @xmath165 ,",
    "these functions develop increasing fluctuations when @xmath2 moves towards zero .",
    "this effect is especially strong for dbk .",
    "furthermore , the lower limit of scales where @xmath52 develops the convincing power - law behavior varies and it takes place at the higher values of @xmath10 for dbk than for eoa , which signals a weaker form of multifractal cross - correlation in the former case .",
    "the corresponding characteristics are shown in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] with the scaling bounds both in @xmath2 and in @xmath10 indicated by the dashed lines .",
    "the calculated @xmath0 and @xmath58 are shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "it is clearly visible that , for eoa , both functions converge to each other for large values of @xmath2 , while @xmath0 is significantly larger than @xmath58 for smaller values of @xmath2 .",
    "these results imply that the scaling properties of @xmath52 strongly depend on the considered time span and they can not be fully quantified by a unique exponent @xmath1 . moreover , based on our results for the msm model",
    ", we can infer that the analyzed processes are ruled by the similar fractal dynamics only in periods with relatively large @xmath161 ( associated with large @xmath2 ) . for smaller @xmath2",
    "s , the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath58 is more evident , which suggests that dynamics of these processes is significantly different , but still cross - correlative .",
    "it is worth to mention that large values of @xmath161 can be a consequence of cross - correlation both in the signs and the amplitudes of the signals .",
    "however , the waiting times are unsigned and the price increments are signed , but the sign is uncorrelated .",
    "this means that , in our case , the amplitude of @xmath161 is only a result of the cross - correlation of the observed amplitude .",
    "the strong cross - correlation of volatility ( modulus of time series ) is confirmed by fig.[fig14 ] , where the cross - correlation function for the waiting times and absolute values of the price increments is depicted .",
    "therefore , we conclude that large fluctuations are much more strongly cross - correlated than the smaller ones",
    ". complexity of the multifractal cross - correlation is expressed by the range of @xmath0 that is approximately @xmath166 in this case .    as may be anticipated already from the structure of @xmath52 for dbk , the behavior of @xmath0 is slightly different and the difference between @xmath58 and @xmath0 is substantial both for small and for large values of @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , right panel ) . also @xmath128 for dbk is smaller than in the case of eoa and takes a value of @xmath167 .",
    "this suggest that although structure of the cross - correlation between the inter - transaction times and the price increments for dbk is multifractal , its heterogeneity is poorer than in the case of eoa .",
    "moreover , similarity between the fractal dynamics of large fluctuations is not so evident than in the former case .",
    "these results are also confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] , where a difference between the strength of volatility cross - correlations for both considered stocks is easily visible .",
    "the results presented here indicate that the multifractal cross - correlation characterizes only relatively large fluctuations of the signals under study .",
    "smaller fluctuations that are filtered out by @xmath168 , from the perspective of multifractal cross - correlation , may be considered mutually independent .    in connection with the present example",
    "we also wish to mention - but without showing the results explicitly in order not to confuse the reader - that taking absolute values of the fluctuation functions to get rid of the sign problem ( as recently often done in literature  @xcite ) , in the present financial data case , would result in a convincing but apparent multifractal scaling for all values of @xmath2 , similar to one that we have already seen for the msm model in fig .",
    "also , the so determined @xmath0 equals @xmath58 as in the msm model . this way one , however , does not extract genuine correlations , but only measures the averaged multifractal properties of individual time series .",
    "another type of correlations that are of theoretical as well as of practical interest are the correlations among stock returns  @xcite .",
    "these are typically quantified in terms of the pearson correlation coefficients or , more generally , in terms of the correlation matrix .",
    "this way of quantifying correlations is , however , restricted to their linear component only . the present formalism of studying the multifractal cross - correlations allows one to reveal some of their potential nonlinear components . as an example",
    ", we therefore use the same two stocks as above ( eoa and dbk ) and , in addition , commerzbank ( cbk ) from the same , german stock exchange over the same period , and perform a similar analysis as above for two pairs of time series ( cbk - dbk and dbk - eon ) representing the corresponding 1 min returns . over the period",
    "considered , this yields 267,241 data points .",
    "the results in the same representation as before are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] .    for @xmath127 , the @xmath52 are not drawn since the corresponding @xmath163 functions fluctuate around zero . as we go to the positive @xmath2 values , however , they start developing a convincing scaling already for @xmath169 ( as indicated by the dashed lines ) for both pairs and for all the scales considered",
    ". this scaling is clearly multifractal and the resulting @xmath0 and @xmath58 , shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] , are somewhat closer to each other than the ones previously considered for correlations between the price increments and the inter - transaction times .",
    "slight differences in relation between the present two pairs of time series are also visible , however . for dbk - eon ,",
    "the departures between @xmath0 and @xmath58 are largely independent on @xmath2 in the region where scaling applies , while for cbk - dbk it starts from larger values for the smallest @xmath2-values ( 0.6 ) , but it converges to even smaller values with an increasing @xmath2 .",
    "this can be interpreted as an indication that multifractal character of cross - correlations resembles more each other for cbk and dbk on the level of large fluctuations and weakens for the smaller ones , while , within the pair dbk - eon , they are of similar strength in the comparable range of fluctuation size .",
    "of course , in both cases this kind of cross - correlations disappears on the level of small fluctuations that are filtered out by the negative values of @xmath2 , and this seems quite a natural effect in the financial context .    as a final example indicating possible applications of the mfcca method introduced in this paper , we study the cross - correlations between the two world leading stock market indices , the dow jones industrial average ( djia ) and the deutscher aktienindex ( dax ) , based on their daily returns . the period considered for both these indices begins on january 12 , 1990 and ends on october 12 , 2013 .",
    "this results in time series of length of 5881 data points .",
    "due to different time zones which the two indices are traded in and in order to test potential applicability of the present algorithm in detecting possible time - lags or asymmetry effects in correlations , we study three possible variants of positioning the time series relative to each other .",
    "the first variant is most natural , i.e. , data points in the two time series meet each other at the same date they are recorded .",
    "the other two variants are such that the time series are shifted by one day relative to each other , either dax is advanced by one day or djia is .",
    "the corresponding @xmath52 functions are displayed in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] . unlike the high - frequency recordings discussed above",
    ", the significantly shorter time series in the present case restrict us to cover a smaller scale range .",
    "nevertheless , evident multifractal scaling can still be identified in this case as indicated by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] , provided the range of @xmath2 is restricted as well .",
    "similarly to the situation with the high frequency cross - correlations within the german stocks , here @xmath163 also fluctuates around zero for negative @xmath2s , and therefore the corresponding functions @xmath52 are not shown .",
    "interestingly , the lower bound in @xmath10 where scaling starts visibly lifts up as we move from the same date , through the situation described as djia leads , and becomes the shortest in the situation dax leads. accordingly , the departures between @xmath58 , which , of course , remains invariant with respect to such relative shifts of the time series , and @xmath170 increase as we go through the above three relative locations of djia versus dax ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] ) .",
    "the strongest djia - dax multifractal cross - correlation is detected when the series are originally arranged relative to each other .",
    "their relative 1-day shifts reveal an effect of asymmetry , however .",
    "the situation djia leads preserves significantly more of such cross - correlations than the opposite \" dax leads one .",
    "this result can be interpreted as an indication that the djia close has more influence on the dax close next day than the dax close has on the djia close next day .",
    "in fact , as verified additionaly , splitting the time series considered here into two halves shows that this effect is more evident in 1990 s than more recently .",
    "such an asymmetry in information transfer between these two stock markets is understandable in economic terms , and in fact it is also consistent with the previous study  @xcite based on the correlation matrix formalism .",
    "finally , we wish to mention that more distant relative shifts of the two present time series quickly deteriorate the multifractal cross - correlation , while at the same time the modulus - based mf - dxa approach leaves them unchanged .",
    "we proposed an algorithm , which we called multifractal cross - correlation analysis , that allows for quantitative description of multiscale cross - correlations between two time series and that is free of limitations the other existing algorithms , like mf - dxa , suffer from . the key point that distinguishes mfcca from other related methods is construction of the @xmath2th - order cross - covariance function @xmath163 in eq.([fq ] ) , which preserves the sign of the cross - covariance fluctuation function @xmath161 after its modulus has been raised to a power of @xmath171 .",
    "this step has two immediate consequences : ( 1 ) it eliminates the risk of appearance of complex values that might lead to problems with their correct interpretation , and ( 2 ) it prohibits losing information that is stored in the negative cross - covariance .",
    "it follows that , as we showed in sec .",
    "[ markov ] regarding known model data , the results obtained with mfcca are more logical and better coincide with intuition than do the parallel results of mf - dxa .",
    "this was true both for the signed and the unsigned , volatility - like processes . on this ground",
    "we concluded that mfcca provides us with the most complete information about fractal cross - correlations possible as compared to the other related methods existing so far . having realized this , we applied mfcca to sample real - world data from the stock markets .",
    "we found that both the cross - stock correlations and the lagged inter - market correlations of returns , as well as the correlations between price movements and the corresponding transaction time intervals are clearly multifractal .",
    "moreover , we showed that carriers of these cross - correlations are predominantly the large fluctuations in both signals , while the smaller fluctuations contribute rather little .",
    "this outcome may suggest that an important ingredient of financial complexity , which manifests itself here as multifractality , might be temporal relations between large events .",
    "apart from the introduction of mfcca , we also focused our attention on the relation between the @xmath2th - order scaling exponent @xmath0 and the averaged generalized hurst exponents @xmath58 .",
    "both these measures are equally important if one intends to comprehend fractal structure of the data under study .",
    "this is because their spectra analyzed in parallel for each signal separately contain information about similarity of their fractal structure .",
    "for example , based on model data , we found that the larger is the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath58 , the more different are the considered ( multi)fractals . we thus strongly recommend investigation of both these quantities in parallel .    we believe that our approach presented here will allow for a wider application of multifractal cross - correlation analysis to empirical data in different areas of science .",
