    "the emergence of multiferroicity in general and ferroelectricity in particular at reduced dimensions have been at the forefront of research towards nanoelectronic applications in recent years  @xcite . besides the technological aspect",
    ", such studies have called into question our present understanding regarding the plausibility of the emerging functional properties at the nanoscale . for example , lee _ et al . _",
    "recently proposed , generalizing on the theoretical calculations and experimental measurements on nanometer thick films of cubic perovskite srtio@xmath2 , that size reduction could in fact lead to emergence of ferroelectric properties in otherwise non - ferroelectric bulk systems  @xcite .",

    "there are several studies which claim that below certain critical size , ferroelectricity disappears ( for a review on this see ref .",
    "one of our own works  @xcite regarding the direct experimental evidence of multiferroicity in charge ordered nanocrystalline manganite pr@xmath3ca@xmath4mno@xmath2 ( pcmo ) , which discusses particle size driven tunability of ferroelectric polarization , belongs to the former category .",
    "the origin of ferroelectricity in pcmo in that case being linked with zener polaron ( zp ) ordering  @xcite , eventually leads to suppression of ferroelectricity with reduction in particle size .",
    "however , ferroelectric response is enhanced in nanocrystalline samples so long as zp ordering is not destroyed  @xcite .",
    "anyway , the finite conductivity and the associated problem of leakage current makes it difficult to get saturated p - e loops with sharp reproducible switching for such nanocrystalline pcmo systems which exhibit zp ordering . in this article , we discuss the origin of sharp ferroelectric switching in self - organized arrays of pcmo nanoislands deposited on si substrate .    depending on the interface energies and the lattice mismatch , the hetero - epitaxial growth modes responsible for self organization of arrays of three dimensional islands are generally divided into two distinct categories : first , volmer - weber ( vw ) which is characterized by islands growth and second , stranski - krastanow ( sk ) , which is characterized by layer by layer growth followed by islands growth  @xcite .",
    "there are several reports which utilize these growth modes to fabricate self - organized arrays of ferroelectric capacitors .",
    "for example , the formation of self organized ferroelectric triangular shaped nano - islands at the initial stage of growth in pbtio@xmath2 and pzt films grown on pt(111)/sio@xmath5/si(100 ) has been reported  @xcite .",

    "thin films of pcmo were grown on si(100 ) and @xmath8 ( 100 ) ( sto ) substrates by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) .",
    "the target of pcmo was prepared in two steps- firstly , we have synthesized nanocrystalline sample by standard sol - gel method .",
    "powders of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 having purity 99.99 @xmath12 ( sigma aldrich ) , used as starting materials were preheated to remove any absorbed moisture .",

    "overall , the dielectric and magnetic measurements fail to detect any structural phase transition but the presence of ferromagnetic correlation in self assembled nanocrystalline array of pcmo with corresponding curie - weiss temperature of 40 k is established .      we have explored the ferroelectric properties by measuring remanent electric polarization based on pund method .",
    "traditional p - e loops are generally composed of ferroelectric , parasitic , or stray capacitance and conductive contributions . therefore , pund method or double wave method  @xcite is a better tool to measure the switching polarization vs. electric field loops . here",

    "we have applied triangular pulses so that rate of change of electric field over time should be fairly constant except for reversal points . the switching electric polarization versus electric field ( @xmath24-e )",
    "loops were studied for all four samples at different temperatures from 80 k-300 k. the maximum applied field was 1 kv / cm at different pulse widths ranging from 1 hz-1 khz .",

    "the increase in coercivity with decreasing temperature is consistent with thermally activated ferroelectric switching . on the other hand , the frequency dependence of coercive field ( @xmath25 ) at a constant temperature ( fig .",

    "[ fig : pund]c that the value of @xmath28 is nearly same for two different @xmath26 of 700 v / cm and 1 kv / cm indicating that @xmath25 values are fairly genuine . moreover , if we compare pcmo@xmath18si 1 and pcmo@xmath18sto 1 which have different growth modes , the coercivity in pcmo@xmath18sto 1 is almost 6 times than that of pcmo@xmath18si 1 ( inset , fig .",

    "the switching time @xmath29 , defined as time in which the value of polarization decreases to @xmath30 of its saturation value , ranges from @xmath31sec depending on the applied electric field .",
    "the decrease of switching time with increasing @xmath26 indicates that the energy required for domain nucleation is mainly supplied by applied electric field .",
    "moreover , since pcmo@xmath18si 1 comprises of isolated self assembled nanostructures , the process of domain nucleation is most likely to occur separately in these islands and switching time captures the collective behaviour of fraction of volume switched .",

    "the general observation is that n is close to 2 for lower electric field values and it decreases to 1 for higher electric fields .",
    "moreover , the value of n decreases with increasing the temperature , too , suggesting a transition from predominantly isotropic domain growth to predominantly anisotropic growth with increase of the electric field and temperature .",
    "the decrease of n with increasing electric field is something unusual given the previous reports on other more conventional ferroelectrics .",
    "one of the possible reasons is that here the nucleation occurs simultaneously in various nano - islands .",
