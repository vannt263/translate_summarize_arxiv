    "high-@xmath4 superconductivity has been widely discussed since its discovery by bednorz and mller in 1986 @xcite . a microscopic mechanism which could explain the characteristic properties of high-@xmath4 superconductors has not been found yet .",
    "however , there has been broad agreement that the physics of the bcs - bec crossover is crucial for high-@xmath4 superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the effects of the crossover are clearly seen in the behaviour of the energy gap and the chemical potential .",
    "the so - called pseudogap has been observed in the excitation spectra of many unconventional superconductors @xcite .    in 2004",
    "jin s group experimentally observed a condensation of pairs of fermionic atoms in the region of the bcs - bec crossover @xcite . a trapped gas of fermionic atoms of @xmath5k was cooled to suitably low temperatures of the order of @xmath6 k and",
    "thereafter the interatomic interaction strength was controlled via the feshbach resonance .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the physics of the bcs - bec crossover in high-@xmath4 superconductors by means of a lattice fermion ( the extended hubbard ) model for the ( 3d ) simple cubic lattice system with hard core on - site repulsion and intersite attraction .",
    "this paper consists of three parts .",
    "the first part gives a discussion of the extended hubbard model in the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "the second part presents the properties of selected quantities and the numerical results . in sec .",
    "iii we summarize the discussion .",
    "the model hamiltonian is the extended hubbard model with on - site ( @xmath7 ) and intersite ( @xmath8 ) interactions : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11  hopping integral .",
    "having transformed hamiltonian ( [ extham ] ) to the reciprocal lattice and using the hartree - fock approximation , the following system of equations for the superconducting order parameter ( @xmath12 ) in the case of the @xmath13 pairing symmetry is obtained : @xmath14 where : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20  lattice constant in the @xmath21-th direction ( we set @xmath22 in further considerations ) , @xmath23  coordination number . the equation for the chemical potential takes the form : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26  electron concentration . solving the above equations simultaneously",
    ", one can find the dependence of the energy gap and the chemical potential on the electron concentration . taking into account only the hopping between the nearest neighbours ,",
    "the electron dispersion is : @xmath27 the evolution from the weak coupling limit ( bcs ) to the limit of the strong coupling ( bec ) takes place when we decrease the electron concentration or increase the interaction . according to the leggett criterion @xcite , the bcs - bec crossover takes place when the modified chemical potential : @xmath28 drops below the lower band edge .    when @xmath29 , the system of equations for the order parameter takes the form ( provided that @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) : @xmath32 @xmath33 because of the fact that we consider the case of @xmath34 , the on - site pairing is forbidden .",
    "one can show it by calculating the anomalous corelation function @xcite .",
    ") for the 3d case ( left ) and the 2d case ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=34.0% ] ) for the 3d case ( left ) and the 2d case ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=34.0% ]    we have performed an analysis of the bcs - bec crossover for the model with hard core repulsion .",
    "the analyzed quantities are : chemical potential , order parameter , coherence length and fraction of condensed particles .",
    "1 shows the ground state ( @xmath0 ) phase diagram for the 3d case ( left ) and the 2d case ( right ; this case has been analyzed in detail in ref @xcite ) .",
    "both in the 2d and the 3d case there exists a critical interaction value for which a bound state forms in the empty lattice ( when @xmath35 ) . for the 2d case @xmath36 . at the same time , it is the minimal interaction value for which a transition to the normal state takes place .",
    "the very existence of the transition to the normal state at @xmath0 at suitably low values of the intersite interaction is interesting ",
    "it indicates that quantum fluctuations are very strong . for the 3d case the critical interaction value for which",
    "a bound state forms in the @xmath35 limit is @xmath37 but the critical interaction value for which a transition to the normal state takes place is @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , as oposed to the 2d case , the minimal interaction value for the emergence of superconductivity is different than the critical interaction value for the emergence of a bound state in the empty lattice . in both cases",
    "the range of occurrence of the local pairs phase widens when we decrease the electron concentration or we increase the interaction .",
    "because of the fact that we consider the case of @xmath38 , the maximum value of the electron concentration is @xmath39 .",
    "now , let us analyze the bcs - bec crossover in the context of the behaviour of the order parameter and the chemical potential .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "2 shows the dependence of the order parameter at the fermi level ( then , on the electron concentration for three values of the intersite interaction . for low electron concentrations",
    "this is a square root dependence , characteristic of the bec limit .",
    "however , for higher electron concentrations one can observe the exponential drop of @xmath40 , characteristic of the bcs limit .",
    "( inset ) ; the horizontal dashed line denotes the band bottom.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=34.0% ]   ( inset ) ; the horizontal dashed line denotes the band bottom.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=34.0% ]        the right panel of fig .",
    "2 shows the dependence of the modified chemical potential on the electron concentration and the intersite interaction ( inset ) . as we mentioned before ,",
    "according to the leggett criterion @xcite , the bcs - bec crossover takes place when the modified chemical potential drops below the lower band edge ( in the 3d case the limiting value is @xmath41 ) .",
    "the horizontal dashed line denotes the band bottom .",
    "the values of @xmath42 for @xmath43 are exact ( despite the fact that we have used the hartree - fock approximation ) and correspond to one half of the bound state energy .",
    "a very important quantity from the point of view of the bcs - bec crossover is the coherence length @xmath44 .",
    "the suggestions to study this quantity in this context result from the observations of the properties of exotic superconductors . in agreement with the uemura s plot @xcite ,",
    "the unconventional superconductors have a considerably shorter coherence length @xmath44 ( @xmath45 @xmath46 ) than the conventional superconductors ( @xmath47 @xmath46 ) .",
    "the coherence length ( pair size ) can be defined as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the pair wave function in the ground state .",
    "3 shows the dependence of the coherence length in units of the lattice constant on the intersite interaction and the electron concentration ( inset ) . because of the fact that we consider the case of hard - core repulsion and intersite attraction , @xmath44 exceeds the value of the lattice constant for any interaction values .",
    "for the values of @xmath50 which slightly exceed the critical value for a given electron concentration ( 5.874 for @xmath43 ) , the pair size for small @xmath26 can be as big as the pair size in the bcs regime .",
    "when we add electrons , the pauli exclusion principle causes a decrease of the pair size , which then becomes just over 1 .",
    "along with a further increase of the electron concentration ( when a crossover to the bcs regime for a given interaction strength occurs ) , the pairs can have large sizes ( due to the pairing in the momentum space ) . fig .",
    "3 shows also the dependence of the coherence length on the intersite interaction .",
    "for each value of @xmath26 , the asymptote of the function @xmath44 is a line coresponding to the critical interaction value for which a transition to the normal state takes place .",
    "another quantity which describes the bcs - bec crossover quantitatively is the fraction of condensed particles : @xmath51        fig .",
    "4 shows the dependence of the fraction of condensed particles on the intersite interaction and electron concentration ( inset ) .",
    "when we increase the intersite interaction or decrease the electron concentration , the fraction of condensed particles increases . in the empty lattice limit , @xmath52 takes the largest value .",
    "the maximum value of the ratio @xmath52 is 0.5 , because if all particles in the system form pairs and condensate , their concentration is twice lower than the initial electron concentration .",
    "a very interesting example is the case of @xmath53 . because of the fact that this interaction value does not exceed the critical interaction value for pair binding",
    ", the saturation of the fermion pairs in the condensate is very small , as the system is in the bcs regime .",
    "the case of the fraction of condensed particles exemplifies very well that the mean - field approximation fails in the regime of higher electron concentration in the hard core repulsion case . because of the fact that @xmath54 , in the @xmath55 limit one should observe a transition to the mott insulator phase",
    ". indeed , fig .",
    "4 shows that the fraction of condensed particles is too high in the @xmath55 limit .",
    "the mechanisms of density - driven and attraction - strength - driven bcs - bec crossover have been considered .",
    "the range of occurrence of the local pairs phase widens when we decrease the electron concentration @xmath26 or we increase the attractive interaction @xmath56 .",
    "we have considered the @xmath13-wave pairing , for which the evolution from the weak coupling limit ( bcs ) to the limit of the strong coupling ( bec ) is smooth . for the case of @xmath1 ,",
    "both in the 2d and the 3d case there exists a critical interaction value for which a bound state forms in the empty lattice ( when @xmath35 ) and the critical interaction value for which a transition to the normal state takes place .",
    "the two critical values coincide in the 2d case , but in the 3d case the critical value for the emergence a bound state is higher than for the emergence of superconductivity .",
    "we have noticed that despite the fact that we have used the hartree - fock approximation , the values of @xmath42 for @xmath43 are exact and correspond to one half of the energy of the bound state .",
    "we have shown that the pair size for small @xmath26 can be as large as the pair size in the bcs regime .",
    "indeed , the hartree - fock approximation fails for higher electron concentrations in the hard core repulsion case  we have considered this issue in the context of the behaviour of the fraction of condensed particles .",
