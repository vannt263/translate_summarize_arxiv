    "this study is the fourth in a series of papers exploring the structure of the region kr  140 and its associated star - forming activity . in @xcite ves  735 , the o - star powering the region was examined .",
    "a second paper , @xcite , was a multiwavelength study of the structure , energetics , and kinematics of the region .",
    "finally , @xcite presented an analysis of submillimetre ( submm hereafter ) observations of the region at 450 and 850  @xmath1 m .",
    "the main result of @xcite was the discovery of numerous submm dust cores located within the molecular gas surrounding the region , including a large number of cores that were clearly located at the interface between ionized and molecular gas , a likely location for star - formation induced or `` triggered '' by the expansion of the region @xcite .",
    "two of the more isolated cores were clearly associated with _ iras _ sources , but the low resolution of _ iras _ combined with the extensive diffuse emission of dust associated with the region made it impossible to determine if any of the other cores were associated with star - formation activity .",
    "the goal of this study is to determine the distribution of young stellar objects ( ysos ) throughout the kr  140 molecular cloud .",
    "we focus especially on the embedded stellar content of the submm cores as these are potentially the youngest star - forming regions .",
    "we use the spatial distribution of the ysos relative to the photodissociation region ( pdr ) surrounding the region as a means of gauging the relative importance of spontaneous and sequential , or triggered , star formation in this region . to achieve this",
    "we have analyzed a combination of submm data from @xcite and @xcite , 2mass ( 2 micron all sky survey ) and midcourse space experiment ( _ msx _ ) infrared data , and newly acquired @xmath2co , @xmath3co and c@xmath0o molecular line data from the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) . in the next section we review the pertinent parameters of kr  140 and provide information on the new observations of the region . in   [ sec:2mass ] and",
    "  [ sec : dist ] we first show how 2mass data can be utilized to identify the yso population and then examine its spatial distribution .",
    "our results are discussed in   [ sec : discuss ] and conclusions are presented in   [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "kr  140 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a 5.7  pc diameter region located at a distance of @xmath6  kpc .",
    "it is close to , but apparently isolated from , the large w3/w4/w5 star - formation complex .",
    "the region is ionized by a single o8.5 v(e ) star ves  735 .",
    "foreground extinction is @xmath7 magnitudes toward ves  735 and ranges between @xmath8 over the region .",
    "molecular line observations ( @xmath2co j@xmath91@xmath100 ) indicate that the region is associated with a molecular cloud with a mass in the range 10@xmath11 ",
    "10@xmath12 m@xmath13 .",
    "a detailed discussion and derivation of these properties can be found in @xcite and @xcite .      for this study we used a combined sample of submm clumps identified in the @xcite and @xcite 850  @xmath1 m scuba scan - maps of the kr  140 region .",
    "there are only minor disagreements between the two samples where they overlap due to the different ways in which structures were identified in the two studies and the correspondence between the two samples is shown in table  [ tbl : subcomp ] . in the area covered by our molecular - line observations ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 , see ",

    "[ fig : av_combi],width=317 ]      visually there appear to be four concentrations of ysos in the kr  140 molecular cloud ( for discussion we will denote these regions  a through d ) along with a noticeable lack of ysos in the northeast portion of the molecular cloud ( see fig .  [ fig : p123dist ] ) .",
    "region  a is at the eastern end of the molecular filament near @xmath21 , region  b is associated with submm clump  1 at @xmath22 , region  c is near the central pdr at @xmath23 , and finally region  d is associated with clumps  17 , 18 and 19 near @xmath24 . to quantify this visual impression we divided the molecular cloud area into @xmath25 boxes and counted the number of stars falling within each box as a rough measure of the yso surface density .",
    "the average number of ysos / box is @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and boxes near the four regions in question had surface densities of 7 , 7 , 6 and 11 for a to d respectively .",
    "there were no other regions in the molecular cloud with similar @xmath28 deviations from the average value .",
    "region  a consists of 17 ysos , four of which are associated with submm clumps .",
    "all of the ysos in this region are t  tauri - like with an average _",
    "( h@xmath10k ) _ value of @xmath29 .",
    "none of the ysos are coincident with _ iras",
    "_  02186 + 6033 ( msx6c  g133.6890 + 00.1643 ) , strengthening its identification as a class  0/i yso .    the focal point of region",
    "b is the submm clump kmjb  1 which was identified as a class  i yso ( _ iras _  02174 + 6052 ) in @xcite .",
    "the higher resolution of the _ msx _ and 2mass data reveal that clump  1 contains two ysos , including an intermediate - mass haebe which is also a _ msx _",
    "point source with a very red mid - infrared spectrum ( f@xmath30 jy , f@xmath31 jy ) .",
    "just to the east of the clump there are two very red ysos .",
    "2mass  02210851 + 6105582 is detected only in one 2mass band with _",
    "_ k__@xmath32 and a lower limit colour of _",
    "( h@xmath10k)@xmath33 _ @xmath34 .",
    "it is also a bright _ msx _ point source ( msx6c  g133.5561 + 00.0919 ) with an extremely red spectrum ( f@xmath35 jy , f@xmath36 jy ) .",
    "the other yso , 2mass  02210610 + 6106043 , is detected in both the _ h _ and _ k _ bands and has _ ( h@xmath10k ) _ @xmath37 and _ k _ @xmath38 . both of these ysos are probably more highly embedded versions of 1.p1 .",
    "in addition , just to the west of kmjb  1 , there is another highly embedded yso with _",
    "k _ @xmath39 and _",
    "( h@xmath10k)@xmath33 _ @xmath40 .",
    "it is quite likely that these objects have formed together as a single grouping of stars .",
    "region  c is interesting because of its association with the pdr ridge seen in the _ msx _ images .",
    "the majority of the stars are found to the northeast of the pdr , while 5 of the remaining 6 stars are found along the pdr with one of the ysos being coincident with a submm clump .",
    "this pattern suggests that star - formation is progressing from northeast to southwest with the submm clumps found along the pdr being the latest round of star formation .",
    "region  d contains the submm clumps  17 , 18 , and 19 .",
    "intermediate - mass and solar - mass ysos are associated with clump  19 and , just to the north of this clump , there are an additional six t  tauri ysos .",
    "all three of these clumps make up the infrared source _ iras _  02157 + 6053 which _ msx _ and",
    "2mass now clearly show is actually a concentration of ysos combined with extended emission from the pdr .",
    "when examining star formation processes within a molecular cloud containing an region , a key distinction is between sequential star formation , where the trigger for star formation is directly related to the presence of the region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and spontaneous star formation , which occurs with no apparent causal relationship with the region . it is well known that for both classical density - bounded regions and blister / champagne - flow regions , the ionization front ( if ) is preceded by a shock front as it propagates into the molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "time - dependent models of pdr / if development around ob stars @xcite show that the if and pd front merge rapidly , i.e. , on time scales less than the main - sequence lifetime of the exciting star , for typical molecular cloud densities . with this in mind",
    "it is useful to consider two distinct environments within the molecular cloud ; the region beyond the direct influence of the region , and the pdr , which is the region directly influenced by the expansion and uv flux of the region and which can be clearly traced by pah emission .",
    "a comparison of the yso population found in each of these regions then gives a measure of the relative importance of sequential and spontaneous star formation within the molecular cloud .",
    "to delineate these two regions we use the @xmath41 w  m@xmath42  sr@xmath43 contour in the _ msx _ band  a image to ( generously ) define the extent of the pdr . we find that 42% of the full yso sample ( p1 , p1 + , p2 and p3 ) lie within the pdr as defined and 58% lie outside the pdr .",
    "the exact percentages will vary somewhat depending on how the pdr is defined .",
    "for example , using a more conservative definition for the pdr region ( @xmath44 w  m@xmath42  sr@xmath43 ) results in 31% of the ysos within the pdr and 69% outside the pdr . the percentages , in both cases , are the same for the yso population both with and without including the p1 + sample . in all cases",
    "it is clear that a substantial fraction of the yso population lies beyond the pdr in this star - forming region and is thus _ not _ the result of sequential star formation associated with the region .",
    "the exciting star of the region , ves  735 , is about 2 myr old @xcite , and kinematic models of the region set expansion timescales of 1 - 2 myr @xcite .",
    "our observations and analysis of kr  140 are consistent with a molecular cloud undergoing continuous star formation over this period .",
    "there is no clear signature of a significant older population of stars seen in the 2mass photometry of the region ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : ccd_p123 ] and [ fig : cmd_p123 ] ) .",
    "lower mass ysos that formed at the same time as ves  735 have had time to disperse through the molecular cloud and may form some of the more spatially distributed population of ysos seen in our sample .",
    "the expansion of the region has swept up material which has subsequently collapsed to form the submm clumps that we observe in the pdr . at the same time",
    "the elongated morphology of the densest portion of the molecular cloud has resulted in ongoing star formation in regions well away from the direct influence of the region . as discussed earlier , the association of haebe and t  tauri stars with dense regions traced in the submm and c@xmath0o support ages of @xmath45 years .",
    "the presence of the class 0/i ysos , _ iras _  02171 + 6058 and _ iras _  02186 + 6033 shows there continues to be very recent star formation activity on the timescale of @xmath46 years @xcite .    finally , many of the massive , apparently starless , submm clumps associated with the pdr may represent the next sites of star formation in the molecular cloud .",
    "deeper images of the region at longer wavelengths would be able to determine if these clumps are starless and test the scenario outlined above by being able to distinguish between different yso evolutionary stages @xcite .",
    "while much of the focus of studies of star formation in and around regions is on the interface regions , our study of kr  140 illustrates that spontaneous star formation occurring away from the interface regions in these molecular clouds can be as important as sequential or triggered star formation related to the expansion of the region .",
    "our analysis shows that the molecular cloud associated with kr  140 contains an extensive population of ysos that is not associated with the pdr .",
    "we have also shown that this yso population is not uniformly distributed though the molecular cloud but is concentrated in four distinct regions .",
    "many of the ysos are also clearly associated with a filamentary structure within the molecular cloud which is traced by c@xmath0o emission .",
    "finally , we see that both low - mass and intermediate - mass ysos are forming throughout the molecular cloud .",
    "particularly interesting is the region around kmjb  1 ( _ iras _  02174 + 6052 ) which contains a tight grouping of a number of embedded intermediate - mass and solar - mass ysos including the very highly embedded intermediate - mass yso 2mass  02210610 + 6106043 .",
    "this research has made extensive use of the nasa / ipac infrared science archive ( irsa ) , the canadian astronomy data centre ( cadc ) , and data from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "irsa is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with nasa .",
