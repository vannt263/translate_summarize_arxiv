    "the chiral abelian anomaly has been discovered , in the past century , by adler , bell and jackiw , after earlier work on @xmath0-decay starting with steinberger and schwinger ; see e.g. [ 1 ] and references given there .",

    "diverse physical implications , especially in particle physics , have been discussed .",
    "it is hard to imagine that one may still be able to find new , interesting implications of the chiral anomaly that specialists have not been aware of , for many years . yet , until very recently  in the past century , but only two to three years ago  this turned out to be possible , and we suspect that further applications may turn up in the future ! this little review is devoted to a discussion of physical implications of the chiral anomaly that have been discovered recently .    before we turn to physics , we recall what is meant by `` chiral ( abelian ) anomaly '' . in general terms",
    ", one speaks of an _ anomaly _ if some quantum theory violates a symmetry present at the classical level , ( i.e. , in the limit where @xmath1 ) . by `` _ violating a symmetry _ ''",
    "one means that it is impossible to construct a unitary representation of the symmetry transformations of the classical system underlying some quantum theory on the hilbert space of pure state vectors of the quantum theory .",
    "( by `` violating a _ dynamical _ symmetry '' is meant that it is impossible to construct such a representation that commutes with the _ unitary time evolution _ of the quantum theory . )",
    "it is quite clear that understanding anomalies can be viewed as a problem in group cohomology theory .",
    "a fundamental example of an anomalous symmetry group is the group of all symplectic transformations of the phase space of a classical hamiltonian system underlying some quantum theory .",
    "the anomalies considered in this review are ones connected with infinite - dimensional groups of gauge transformations which are symmetries of some classical lagrangian systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom ( lagrangian field theories ) .",
