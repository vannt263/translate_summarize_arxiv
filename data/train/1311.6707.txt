    "l - type dwarfs are ultracool objects cooler than m dwarfs .",
    "most l dwarfs are expected to be brown dwarfs , i.e. , have insufficient mass to achieve the central temperatures and pressures necessary for sustained hydrogen burning .",
    "brown dwarfs have physical properties intermediate between the least massive stars and the most massive planets and are thus a useful bridge between studies of stars and planets @xcite",
    ". however , the lack of a unique age - mass - spectral type relationship leads to distance being a critical parameter to understand brown dwarfs .",
    "a distance is required to derive an absolute magnitude and hence energy output .",
    "parallaxes are a model independent parameter that can be used to constrain radius or temperature thus allowing modeling to explore relations between other parameters , mass - surface gravity- age - metallicity , more freely . considering that distances are so valuable",
    ", it is a sign of the difficulty in obtaining them that out of more than 900 known l dwarfs ( www.dwarfarchives.org hereafter dwarfarchive ) less than 90 have measured parallaxes and , when this programme started , there were less than 20 .    here",
    "we discuss the determination of parallax and proper motion for five l dwarfs using the robotic liverpool telescope ( hereafter lt , steele et al .",

    ", the observations required for parallax determinations are quite simple and routine .",
    "the important characteristics for observations in a parallax program are stability in the instrumental setup and repeatability in the observational procedure .",
    "the rigorous scheduling criteria , efficient use of time , flexibility in scheduling , and , observational consistency in robotic observations make it a very attractive possibility for parallax programs .",
    "this program was envisioned to see if the lt could become an exemplar parallax machine for future parallaxes of bright brown dwarfs and nearby red dwarfs .",
    "the number of brown dwarfs is increasing rapidly with continued discoveries from wide - field sky survey program , e.g. , sdss @xcite , vista @xcite , cfht @xcite , ukirt @xcite , and wise @xcite surveys .",
    "many of these are observable with the lt .",
    "this paper is divided into seven sections . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction procedures . in section 3",
    "we report the main astrometric results . in section 4",
    "we study the binarity , galactic membership , metallicity and gravity properties using spectral type - absolute magnitude , u - v velocity and color- absolute magnitude with model tracks diagrams . in section 5",
    "we present the bolometric flux , luminosity and effective temperature of our targets obtained combining our measured parallaxes with the optical / infrared spectra and evolutionary / atmospheric models . in section 6 we comment on individual objects and in section 7",
    "we summarize our findings and briefly describe our future work plan .",
    "the lt is a totally robotic telescope located at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos on the canary island of la palma in spain and operated by the liverpool john moores university in the united kingdom .",
    "it is an alt - az telescope with ritchey - chretien cassegrain optics with a primary mirror of 2.0 m. in 2004 , when this parallax program started , there were two instruments that were suitable for a brown dwarf parallax program : supircam and ratcam .",
    "supircam is an infrared sensitive 256x256 pixel hgcdte array with a pixel scale of 0.413 arcsecond / pixel and a field of view of 1.7 arcmin .",
    "ratcam is an optically sensitive 2048x2048 pixel ccd camera with a pixel scale of 0.1395 arcsecond / pixel and a field of view of 4.6 arcmin .",
    "the sdss-@xmath0 filter ( hereafter simply @xmath0 ) corresponds to the brightest optical magnitude for l dwarfs .",
    "the larger field , smaller pixel scale and similar required exposure times for typical l dwarfs of the ratcam instrument in the @xmath0 band filter compared to the supircam in the j filter led to ratcam being the preferred choice for our program .",
    "the target list was selected from the literature with the following criteria : visible to the lt , a @xmath0 band magnitude brighter than 18 , no published trigonometric parallax in 2004 and those objects with the smallest photometric distance were preferred . here",
    "we report on the five that have enough observations spread over 2004/2005 , 2008/2009 and 2011/2012 to provide reliable parallaxes . in table",
    "[ wpit1 ] we list the five objects with their @xmath0 , and estimated @xmath0 , 2mass @xmath1 @xcite and wise @xmath2 @xcite band magnitudes , optical and near - infrared spectral types .",
    "the five targets were observed between august 2004 and july 2012 using ratcam with the @xmath0 band filter . in order to minimize the effect of differential color refraction , we observe when the targets are within 30 minutes of the meridian .",
    "the observations were primarily made during twilight hours , since this is when the objects have maximum parallax factors in right ascension .",
    "observed this way , the data are primarily located on the ends of the major semi - axis of their parallax ellipse . during each observation",
    "we take three exposures of 160s to allow for robust removal of cosmic rays and to diminish the random errors .",
    "one exposure of this length nominally provides a signal - to - noise of more than 50 on these targets .",
    "differential color refraction ( dcr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the small varying displacement of objects with different colors in a field that results from the variation of the atmosphere refractive index with wavelength .",
    "it is strongest in the blue bands and gradually gets very small in the infrared .",
    "the targets in this parallax program are redder than the anonymous reference objects so this displacement is systematically different from the average of those reference objects .",
    "we request that all our observations are made within 30 minutes of the meridian so the variation in airmass , and hence differential movement , is minimized . in the torino observatory parallax program ( hereafter topp , smart et al .",
    "1999 ) we found the effect was very small in the i band and it will be smaller for the @xmath0 band , though l dwarfs are redder than the topp targets . in the work by dahn et al .",
    "( 2002 ) they do not include dcr terms as they found they changed the @xmath0 band parallax of l and t objects by only 0.3 mas . in albert et al .",
    "( 2011 ) they also found the dcr in the @xmath0 band on relative astrometry of brown dwarfs was small enough to neglect . following these results , and in light of our observational criteria , we have not included dcr terms in this analysis . for future work we will carry out a number of experiments to measure the dcr in the lt @xmath0 band system and review this decision .      the bias subtraction , trimming of the overscan regions , dark subtraction and flat fielding",
    "are carried out via the standard lt pipeline @xcite .",
    "however , images in the @xmath0 band display prominent fringes caused by thin - film interference ( see appendix a in * ? ? ?",
    "fringes have a small effect on the photometry and astrometry for bright objects , but can have a significance impact for faint objects when their fluxes are comparable with the intensity of the fringes .",
    "since our targets are relatively faint , we must investigate the impact of fringes .    to examine the intensity and evolution of the fringes we divide the images into three sub - samples : ( 1 ) 2004/2005 , ( 2 ) 2008/2009 and ( 3 ) 2011/2012 images .",
    "each sub - sample contains several hundreds of frames . for each frame in each sub - sample we pick out an empty area ( of 100@xmath3100  pixels ) which is seriously fringed but without any or with very few objects .",
    "we calculate the rms of the counts and average the values within each sub - sample .",
    "we find the count variations before and after defringing are 11.2 and 9.5 , 8.1 and 6.8 , 8.6 and 7.5 respectively for the three subsets , a difference that we consider significant .",
    "the standard lt pipeline constructed biannual fringe maps and our first attempt was to use the most appropriate for each night .",
    "however , fringes are dependent on the sky conditions at the time of observation and vary during the course of a night",
    ". the ideal case would be to make a fringe map for each image , but this is not feasible .",
    "in addition we usually only have a few images in any given night so even a per night fringe map is not possible .",
    "our second attempt was to construct fringe maps following the recipe in andrei et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for subsets of 20 - 30 frames while attempting to keep nights and periods covered intact . using the fringe maps constructed by ourselves usually gave similar parallax results to those using the lt fringe map except in the case of the fainter targets .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that sometimes to have sufficient frames to construct a fringe map we had to include a relatively long time - span but with few frames compared to the lt fringe maps .",
    "the results presented here used the lt fringe maps which also produced more robust parallax solutions .      since",
    "our targets are faint and our data impacted by fringes which we can not remove completely , it is critical to have appropriate centroiding software in order to determine their position which is the fundamental data for a parallax determination .",
    "we tried several different methods : ( 1 ) two - dimensional gaussian fit to the point spread function as used in the topp , ( 2 ) the widely used sextractor routine which is designed for large scale galaxy surveys and also works well on moderately crowded star fields ( http://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor ) and ( 3 ) the maximum likelihood barycenter as implemented in the imcore software of the cambridge astronomy survey unit ( casu , http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/surveys-projects/software-release ) .",
    "we tested all the centroiding procedures by comparing object positions from 57 frames of the 2m1807 + 5015 field .",
    "the centroiding was also tested with different defringing procedures .",
    "we found that for brighter objects we get similar results but casu imcore centroids work significantly better for the fainter ones giving smaller errors .",
    "if we do not defringe , the median @xmath4 , @xmath5 for the _ x , y _ coordinates are 25,28 mas for all objects , and 13,14 mas for objects brighter than magnitude z=17 . applying the fringe map provided by lt pipeline we find that the precision improves to 21,21 mas and 11,11 mas respectively . in fig .",
    "[ wpif1 ] we present the standard deviations of the object coordinates in the 2m1807 + 5015 sequence defringed with the lt biannual fringe maps and centroided with the casu routines .    based on our experience in other parallax programs we expected to achieve a lower floor than 11,11 mas for the centroiding precision .",
    "we note that the ratcam ccd has electronic gates aligned with x axis and physical gates aligned with y axis .",
    "the precision from electronic gates is better than the physical gates .",
    "the source of this higher noise is probably because that nominally @xmath6 is orientated in the direction of ra and @xmath7 in dec , but due to flexibility problems with the ratcam coolant pipes it was not possible to always keep the same alignment .",
    "a procedure of `` cardinal pointing '' is adopted that aligns the rotator to one of the four cardinal positions : 0 , 90 , 180 and 270 .",
    "a third of our observations have the rotator aligned to 0 , that is with north at top , east at left .",
    "the other images are evenly distributed between the other cardinal points , except during the first year of observation when there are also non - standard positions with a number of different angles .",
    "since the astrometric distortion is partially a function of the focal plane variations , this physical rotation of the focal plane impacts negatively on the expected precision .",
    "the new infrared - optical camera on the lt does not have this constraint .",
    "another possible source for this high floor is that our observations for 2m1807 + 5015 covered several years and there will be a small contribution from random proper and parallactic motion of the reference stars .",
    "since we expose three times for each target in each night the precision using these three frames excludes this random motion contribution .",
    "there are 3 observations on 19 nights so we have 19 sub - groups with 3 frames in each .",
    "for each sub - group we calculated their median @xmath4,@xmath5 for all objects and for objects brighter than @xmath0=17 . in fig [ wpif2 ]",
    "we plot the sigma versus epoch , the median precision for the objects brighter than @xmath0=17 improved to 3.8,3.7 mas . as each sample",
    "comprises of only three images we expect this to be an underestimate of the true sigma but it supports our hypothesis of the contribution from random motions . since our parallax solutions come from the combined data - sets we must include the instrumental and reference system variations , so considering consistency of the final and per - epoch errors we assume an observational precision of 11,11 mas .",
    "using the _ x , y _ coordinates determined from the casu imcore software we derived the parallaxes and proper motions using the methods adopted in the topp ( smart et al .",
    "2003 , 2007 ) .",
    "the software selects the frames and reference stars automatically , for example frames with less than four reference stars in common , or , stars with large errors or high proper motions , are dropped .",
    "a base frame is selected in the middle of the sequence with a high number of stars .",
    "this base frame is transferred to a standard coordinate system using objects in common with 2mass .",
    "the other frames are then transferred to this system using all common stars with a linear transformation . then by fitting the combined observations of the target in the standard coordinate system we find its relative parallax and proper motion . the correction from relative to absolute parallax",
    "is calculated using the galaxy model of @xcite as described in smart et al .",
    "we estimate the error on this correction to be around 30% or 0.4 - 0.6 mas for these fields @xcite , which is negligible compared to the formal error of the parallaxes .    in table",
    "[ wpit2 ] we list our results and in fig . [ wpif3 ] we plot the solutions for the targets 2m1807 + 5015 and sd1717 + 6526 which have respectively the lowest and highest parallax errors . as shown in fig .",
    "[ wpif1 ] the centroiding deteriorates significantly as the object gets fainter .",
    "this is reflected in the correlation of derived parallax precision with apparent magnitude in tables [ wpit1 ] and [ wpit2 ] and explains the noisier observations of sd1717 + 6526 .",
    "in this section we examine the physical characteristics of our objects using our parallax and proper motion results and taking advantage of two different brown dwarf models .      in fig .",

    "their radial velocity distribution is similar to m dwarfs and we can then estimate their membership statistically as described below .",

    "we assume that the other three l dwarfs without measured radial velocity have velocities which follow the gaussian distribution of the sdss m dwarfs as described above and then plot their @xmath12 and @xmath25 projection along the straight lines as shown in fig.[wpif5 ] . on these lines",
    "we plot three points for each object , indicating their @xmath12 and @xmath25s when adopting radial velocity 0 and @xmath2630 km / s .",

    "<S> for all five objects , we derived effective temperature , luminosity , radius , gravity and mass from a evolutionary model(cba00 ) and our measured parallax ; for three of the objects , we derived their effective temperature by integrating observed optical and near - infrared spectra and model spectra(bsh06 or bt - dusty respectively ) at longer wavelengths to obtain bolometric flux and then using the classical stefan - boltzmann law : generally the three temperatures for one object derived using two different methods with three models are consistent , while at lower temperature(e.g . for l3 ) the differences among the three temperatures </S>",
