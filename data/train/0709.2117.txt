    "these examples motivate the consideration of general subspace manifolds as formulated in definitions  [ def : cinfsubman ] , [ def : locunitsubman ] and  [ def : beurlingsubman ] .",
    "the embracing realm we consider is the traditional one allied to operator function theory , namely the set of subspaces of @xmath5 of the form @xmath24 where @xmath0 is the hardy space for the upper half plane , @xmath25 is unimodular , and @xmath26 is the space of functions supported on a measurable set @xmath27 .",

    "these include the special cases considered by katavolos and power  @xcite , @xcite which were derived by ad hoc arguments leaning on operator algebra methods .",
    "specifically we show by direct methods that the space of functions @xmath30 has subspace manifold @xmath31 whose closure is homeomorphic to the closed unit disc , while for the space @xmath32 the manifold @xmath33 has closure homeomorphic to the closed unit ball in  @xmath34 .",

    "we are not aware of any other proof , direct or indirect , of this seemingly classical fact .",

    "the proof makes use of methods of stein  @xcite for the analysis of oscillatory integrals .",
    "we go on to show that for quite general @xmath8 dimensional spaces @xmath29 of admissible functions the subspace manifold @xmath47 has closure homeomorphic to the closed unit ball in @xmath16 .",

    "we consider the sphere @xmath51 and its hyperbolic variant , the 3-sphere @xmath52 , from the point of view of their unitary automorphism symmetries .",
    "the analysis here exploits the nontrivial foliations induced by the natural order on projections .",
    "it is shown that the group @xmath53 of unitaries which act bijectively on @xmath51 is generated by the set @xmath54 that is , by two 1-parameter unitary groups , the scalar circle group and the fourier - plancherel transform @xmath55 .",

    "it of interest then to identify similar compact projection manifolds which are smooth off a finite set . in this regard we see in section  [ sec:5.3 ] that this is not generally the case for other polynomial @xmath9-spheres @xmath49 .    as we have intimated above our considerations",

    "this reveals once again the geometric strictness of unitary equivalence .",
    "we note the following alternative curvature free approach to this and in subsequent sections we find , similarly , that we do not need to consider curvature .",
