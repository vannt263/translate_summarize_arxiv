    "the physics of the higgs - sector is one of the most important subjects of high - energy experiments in the near future . to distinguish the standard model ( sm ) higgs - sector from other theoretical models",
    ", the calculation of radiative corrections to high - energy processes may be very important .",
    "in addition , the effects of a higgs boson on low - energy observables such as the @xmath11-parameter already need to be included in present precision measurements .",
    "however , the calculation of the complete higher - order corrections is a difficult task .",
    "it is therefore important if one can calculate the most significant corrections relatively simply within a well - defined approximation . in the case of a heavy higgs boson , such an approximation is provided by the equivalence theorem ( eqt ) @xcite .",
    "this theorem shows that the leading correction to a physical process in powers of @xmath0 can be obtained at any order by replacing the vector bosons @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the sm by the associated scalar goldstone bosons @xmath4 , @xmath5 which appear in the symmetry breaking sector of the theory in the limit of vanishing gauge couplings .",
    "this results in a substantial simplification of the calculations .",
    "the equivalence theorem is known to hold for @xmath12 .",
    "an important question , however , is how heavy the higgs boson must be before the equivalence theorem gives a good approximation to the full electroweak theory .",
    "the existence of a heavy top quark leads to a large yukawa coupling @xmath13 in the sm . in the case of a not - so - heavy higgs boson",
    ", one can expect the radiative corrections which involve @xmath13 to be comparable in magnitude to the corrections which involve the quartic higgs coupling @xmath14 .",
    "it is therefore desirable to take these contributions into account , and to calculate them in a simple way .",
    "this can again be done using the equivalence theorem : in the limit of vanishing gauge couplings , the fermions couple only to the higgs boson and the goldstone bosons in the symmetry breaking sector of the theory .",
    "however , the specific calculational scheme used has to be consistent both with the eqt as formulated for the bosons @xcite , and with the complete sm . in the present paper",
    "we show how this can be achieved by extending the equivalence theorem , including fermions , and implementing consistent renormalization conditions .",
    "the resulting framework is a foundation for future calculations of leading higher - order electroweak corrections , and it is applicable to all orders in @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "gauge interactions are explicitly set to zero .",
    "previous calculations based on the eqt have mostly been concerned with processes in which both the external and internal particles are higgs bosons @xmath17 or longitudinally polarized gauge bosons @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite , and have neglected corrections from internal fermion loops . an exception is the work of barbieri _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who calculated the @xmath20 corrections to the decays @xmath21 and @xmath22 using a method based on the equivalence theorem , but with the fermion fields renormalized only to one loop .",
    "the framework presented here allows the systematic inclusion of internal fermion loops at higher orders , as well as the calculation of radiative corrections to processes involving external fermions .",
    "we illustrate our method at the one - loop level using the fermionic decay of the higgs boson , @xmath23 .",
    "the equivalence theorem result approximates the full electroweak correction to @xmath24 very well for @xmath25 gev , but fails near the threshold at 350 gev for @xmath10 gev , where the effects of the gauge interactions become important .",
    "the result for @xmath26 is also quite good for @xmath27 gev , though the accuracy is reduced by a cancellation between the yukawa and higgs - boson contributions .",
    "the gauge couplings give the dominant , very small , corrections for lower values of @xmath28 .",
    "we will be concerned in later sections with the calculation of the leading contributions to the decay rate of the higgs boson to fermions , @xmath29 , in the limit of large higgs - boson mass , @xmath30 .",
    "our tool for extracting the leading contributions in powers of @xmath31 will be the goldstone boson equivalence theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem states that the dominant electroweak contribution to a feynman graph can be calculated by replacing the gauge bosons @xmath2 , @xmath3 of the full electroweak theory by the would - be goldstone bosons @xmath4 , @xmath5 of the symmetry - breaking sector of the theory , and ignoring the gauge couplings .",
    "the result is an expansion for the dominant contributions in powers of @xmath32 , or equivalently , in powers of the quartic higgs coupling @xmath15 . in the limit @xmath33 , the tranverse gauge bosons decouple from the fermions and the scalar fields , and",
    "can be ignored .",
    "the remainder of the standard electroweak model reduces to a theory defined by the equivalence - theorem lagrangian @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the lagrangian for the scalar fields in the symmetry - breaking sector , and @xmath36 is the lagrangian for the fermions which includes their yukawa interactions with the scalar fields .",
    "this reduced theory gives a good approximation to the full electroweak theory for @xmath37 , provided that the couplings are properly defined and the goldstone modes are renormalized at a momentum scale @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we will work entirely in the equivalence theorem limit using @xmath6 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 we have written only the top- and bottom quark contributions to @xmath41 ; the remaining fermionic contributions have the same form , with no righthanded contributions for the neutrinos . in these expressions ,",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are su(2)@xmath45 doublets with normalizations defined by @xmath46 the righthanded fields are su(2)@xmath45 singlets , with @xmath47 the expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ l0higgs ] ) and ( [ l0fermi ] ) include all possible su(2)@xmath48u(1)@xmath49 symmetric terms consistent with renormalizability of the lagrangian .",
    "the counterterms necessary to effect the renormalization without breaking the symmetry must have the same forms , and can be introduced by independent multiplicative rescalings of each term above .",
    "thus , in the case of the higgs lagrangian , all possible symmetric counterterms are generated by multiplying the kinetic energy term by a factor @xmath50 , replacing @xmath15 by @xmath51 , and @xmath52 by @xmath53 . because the minimum in the higgs potential is at a nonzero value of @xmath54 for @xmath55",
    ", @xmath43 has a nonzero expectation value in the physical vacuum , @xmath56 we will absorb the vacuum expectation value by rewriting the field @xmath57 as @xmath58 .",
    "this results in an expansion around the physical vacuum in which @xmath59 the renormalized higgs lagrangian then has the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the so(3 ) vector @xmath62 with @xmath63 , and we have dropped an additive constant .",
    "it is convenient for calculation to define a set of rescaled or `` bare '' fields @xmath64 , @xmath65 and the corresponding su(2)@xmath45 doublet @xmath66 such that the kinetic terms in @xmath35 have the customary unit normalization , @xmath67 and to introduce a corresponding bare vacuum expectation value @xmath68 , a bare coupling @xmath69 , and a parameter @xmath70 , @xmath71 with this rescaling , we obtain the form of @xmath35 that we will use , @xmath72 the fermion lagrangian @xmath36 can be treated in a similar fashion .",
    "there is a separate su(2)@xmath48u(1)@xmath49-symmetric counterterm for each term in eq .",
    "( [ l0fermi ] ) .",
    "these counterterms can be absorbed in the definitions of a set of bare fields and couplings to bring @xmath36 into the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 note that there are separate renormalization constants for the @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and a single renormalization constant for the left - handed doublet @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath77 in @xmath78 has been introduced for later convenience .      in order that the theory defined by @xmath6 correspond to the equivalence theorem limit of the standard electroweak model , the definitions of the couplings and the renormalization scheme must be chosen to be consistent with that limit .",
    "such a choice is not automatic .",
    "it is necessary that : ( _ i _ ) , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 fields be renormalized at a momentum scale @xmath79 with @xmath80 @xcite ; and ( _ ii _ ) , the couplings be defined in terms of physical standard - model quantities which have well - defined limits for @xmath81 . in the following , we will use an on - mass - shell renormalization scheme , define the quartic higgs coupling in terms of the fermi constant @xmath82 and the physical higgs - boson mass @xmath28 , and relate the yukawa couplings to the physical masses of the fermions .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bosons are guaranteed to be massless by the goldstone theorem @xcite .",
    "we will therefore renormalize the @xmath83 and @xmath84 fields at @xmath85 , thus satisfying condition ( _ i _ ) , and will renormalize the higgs field at @xmath86 .",
    "the quartic coupling @xmath15 will be defined @xcite to be given _",
    "exactly _ by the relation @xmath87 where @xmath82 is the fermi constant obtained from the muon decay rate using the standard electromagnetic radiative corrections , and @xmath88 is the physical vacuum expectation value , @xmath89 .",
    "while this definition involves a process at a low momentum transfer , it connects smoothly with equivalence theorem limit as shown in @xcite .",
    "the determination of the renormalization constants proceeds as follows .",
    "the real part of the two - point function or inverse propagator @xmath90 for each of the particles must vanish for @xmath79 equal to the square of the physical mass of that particle , @xmath91 .",
    "the two - point functions calculated using the bare fields are easily seen to have the form @xmath92 where the @xmath93 s are the bare self - energy functions .",
    "since there is only a single mass counterterm @xmath70 in the higgs lagrangian , eq.([lhiggs ] ) , the vanishing of the renormalized masses @xmath94 and @xmath95 required by the goldstone theorem leads to the relations @xmath96 and determines @xmath70 .",
    "the self - energy functions for the bare @xmath4 and @xmath5 fields must therefore be equal at @xmath85 , an identity that holds to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "this would not be surprising in the absence of yukawa couplings since the goldstone fields then have an so(3 ) symmetry , and @xmath97 and @xmath98 are necessarily identical for all values of @xmath79 .",
    "however , the presence of fermions with unequal yukawa couplings in @xmath6 breaks the so(3 ) symmetry , and destroys the equality of the self - energy functions except at the special point @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "the equality @xmath99 can be checked to one loop using the results we give later . in the following ,",

    "( [ gammah ] ) .",
    "the on - mass - shell condition for the higgs boson , @xmath102 , gives the relation @xmath103 upon replacing @xmath104 by @xmath105 and @xmath70 by @xmath106 in this expression and solving for @xmath69 , we find that @xcite @xmath107 the condition that @xmath88 be the physical vacuum expectation value requires the vanishing of the truncated one - point function for the higgs field , @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the sum of all higgs tadpole graphs ( see fig.[figtadpoles ] ) calculated using the bare fields .",
    "this gives the further relation @xmath110 , so @xmath70 can be calculated either as a self energy or as a tadpole contribution .",
    "the resulting identity , @xmath111 provides a useful check on the calculations @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of the one - point function , eq .  ( [ tadpole ] ) , implies that the tadpole diagrams and the tadpole counterterm in eq .",

    "the problem which remains is that of determining @xmath50 , an essential step in connecting the scalar theory to the full electroweak theory through the equivalence theorem .",
    "the crucial observation is that the fermi constant @xmath82 , and therefore the vacuum expectation value @xmath88 , is defined through charged - current processes , i.e. , muon decay and superallowed nuclear beta decays .",
    "these involve the @xmath125 rather than the @xmath3 boson .",
