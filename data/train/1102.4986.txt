    "ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation is an important factor in the physical and chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks .",
    "it heats up a disk atmosphere , affecting both its structure and an emergent spectral energy distribution , and also controls the molecular content of the upper disk . a uv part of the spectrum comes primarily not from the star itself but from the inner region of an accretion flow ( accretion shock , accretion column , etc . ) . as a result ,",
    "the shape of the uv continuum and uv emission lines vary from a star to a star . unlike the black body ( bb ) part of the stellar spectrum ,",
    "its near uv part may significantly depend on details of a particular source , which is confirmed by available uv observations of t  tau stars @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we consider possible effects of a uv irradiation on the structure of a protoplanetary disk , in terms of density , temperature , and molecular composition .",
    "this influence is related to disk heating by the central source and to the rates of photoreactions .",
    "as both factors depend on the overall distribution of the uv field in the disk , it is reasonable to expect that they are most influenced by the grain evolution ( growth and sedimentation ) which marks the very initial stage of planet formation .",
    "radiative transfer  ( rt ) modeling of a protoplanetary disk is still a challenging problem ( due to high optical depths and large variations of physical conditions ) , and special efforts are being made to develop appropriate methods ( see @xcite for benchmarking of rt codes ) . a large number of protoplanetary disk models has been created over the last two decades .",
    "some of these models are focused on detailed ( 2d/3d ) treatment of rt in dust continuum in order to describe the disk thermal structure and its spectral energy distribution ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the goal of other models is to study in detail the chemical and micro - physical structure of protoplanetary disks ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these simulations provide physical quantities ( ionization degree , separate dust and gas temperatures ) which control the dynamics of protoplanetary disks .",
    "these simulations are also extremely important to interpret existing and future observations of dust and molecular emission .",
    "our goal is to develop a `` balanced '' model of a protoplanetary disk which would be relatively simple , but at the same time powerful enough to allow direct observational verification .",
    "the model will be balanced in terms of complexity / reliability between rt and micro - physics treatment . with this model",
    "we plan to study the influence of different physical processes on the physical / chemical structure and observational appearance of a protoplanetary disk . in the current version of the model",
    "we restrict ourselves to 1d vertical rt but with scattering and detailed frequency dependence ( unlike @xcite where 2d rt is adopted but with only a few frequency channels ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , good frequency coverage is more important than angular ray coverage , that supports our approximation .",
    "to find mutually consistent density and temperature distributions in a disk one needs an iterative process . as a starting point , we use gas and dust distributions from @xcite . with these distributions being set , we can solve a rt problem and find thermal structure of the disk , accounting for the external radiation ( a central star with uv excess and diffuse galactic uv background ) .",
    "the disk temperature distribution is found by means of a two - stream model of the rt with detailed frequency grid ( @xmath0 200 frequencies covering a range from 100 nm to 1 mm ) .",
    "we assume that gas and dust are thermally coupled , while the temperature is determined by the dust thermal emission , absorption and isotropic scattering .",
    "the radiation field is separated into two streams , going from the surface of the disk to the midplane and in the opposite direction .",
    "such simplified consideration leads to the following rt equation in the @xmath1-direction : @xmath2=j_{\\nu}(z)-s_{\\nu}(z)\\ ] ] where @xmath3 $ ] is the mean intensity , @xmath4 $ ] is the extinction coefficient , @xmath5 is equal to @xmath6 or @xmath7 for the cases of eddington and schwarzschild - shuster approximations , respectively , and @xmath8 is the source function : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the planck function , @xmath11 $ ] and @xmath12 $ ] are the absorption and scattering coefficients , @xmath13 .",
    "the rt equation has to be solved simultaneously with the energy balance equation which is written under the assumption of radiative equilibrium : @xmath14d\\,\\nu=0.\\ ] ] the rt equation is solved using the analog of the feautrier method with the triagonal ( thomas ) algorithm for a hypermatrix . to carry out the iterations between mean intensity @xmath15 and the temperature @xmath16 we employ the linear approximation of the planck function @xmath17 .",
    "the current approximation of @xmath18 allows to find the updated mean intensity distribution @xmath19 .",
    "the solution of the rt equation in @xmath1-direction is repeated for a number of radial distances @xmath20 , which gives the complete temperature distribution @xmath21 .",
    "the dust opacities are calculated from the mie theory ( astrosilicate dust graines , @xcite ) .",
    "once the thermal structure @xmath21 of the disk is known , we find the gas density structure @xmath22 at each @xmath20 by integrating the equation of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the gas pressure , @xmath25 is the mean molecular weight ( @xmath26 for h@xmath27 and he mixture ) , @xmath28 is the proton mass .",
    "iterations are used to obtain self - consistent density and thermal distributions . in order to completely solve the problem we need to specify a surface density @xmath29 which was taken from @xcite .",
    "the code has been extensively tested , first , for cases allowing analytical solutions .",
    "we considered a ) an optically thin media with the only heating source ( radiation or accretion ) , b ) a media with arbitrary optical depth irradiated by blackbody radiation field , and c ) one - frequency case for a media with arbitrary optical depth , accretion heating and incident flux .",
    "second , our model has been compared with the model by @xcite . in their model , the direct stellar irradiation is considered to be the separate dust heating source , and the solution of the rt equation is being sought for the diffuse field .",
    "our model produces colder upper layers , while midplane temperature is somewhat higher .",
    "we interpret the difference in the upper layer temperature for the two models as a possible consequence of underestimated direct stellar irradiation in our model . at the same time",
    ", higher midplane temperatures in our model seem to be more realistic due to more accurate computation of dust radiative heating .",
    "we consider two dust models and four representations for the spectrum of the central object . in model a5 dust",
    "is assumed to be well mixed with gas , with the mass ratio of 0.01 . in model gs ( growth and sedimentation ) the dust distribution differs significantly from that of gas because of grain growth and sedimentation @xcite . while the average grain size is 10@xmath30 cm in model a5 , in the midplane it increases because of dust evolution up to @xmath31  cm at the disk periphery ( @xmath32au ) and @xmath33  cm in the inner disk region ( we only consider locations with @xmath34au ) .",
    "large grains sediment to the disk midplane , which causes spatial variations in the dust - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "the ratio grows to few times @xmath35 in the midplane and decreases to @xmath36 in the disk atmosphere .",
    "the stellar spectrum is assumed to be that of a black body with @xmath37k .",
    "we add a uv excess to this spectrum , described by the scaled interstellar uv field ( jd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a smoothed bp tau spectrum ( jb ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a black body spectrum with temperature of 20000k ( j20 ) . in all cases",
    "excess uv continuum is added only for @xmath38 .",
    "all added uv contributions are normalized to have the same mean intensity at @xmath39 , as the star spectrum .",
    "also , we consider a case without a uv excess ( j4 ) .",
    "model designations are listed in table  [ moddes ] .",
    "ll + gs & growth and sedimentation + a5 & unevolving dust properties with + & an average size of @xmath40 cm +   + j4 & black body spectrum with @xmath37k + j20 & black body spectrum with @xmath41k + jb & scaled bp tau spectum + jd & scaled interstellar draine uv field +",
    "the influence of grain growth and settling on the disk structure has been studied in the literature a number of times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the general conclusion of these studies is that dust growth causes lower temperatures in the upper disk . the stellar radiation is mostly absorbed by small grains , and their number diminishes due to coagulation . on the other hand",
    ", dust sedimentation makes the upper disk more transparent and hotter .",
    "the resultant temperature is thus defined by the net effect of dust evolution .",
    "another factor which is important for disk heating is the uv continuum . in figure  [ fourcont ]",
    "we show vertical temperature profiles at distances of 1au , 33au , and 508au from the central source for models gs ( left column ) and a5 ( right column ) . for simplicity",
    "no iterations for the density structure has been performed for data on this figure .",
    "these profiles are quite different for the cases of pristine and evolved dust . in model a5 , where dust has the standard ism properties ,",
    "vertical temperature profile only weakly depends on the shape of the uv spectrum of the central source , while in model gs the dependence is more significant .",
    "if no uv continuum is taken into account , the disk with evolved dust ( gs - j4 ) is indeed somewhat colder than the disk with pristine dust ( a5-j4 ) .",
    "however , if there is uv continuum , the disk with evolved dust is hotter for considered cases .",
    "temperature difference between various spectra is 120k in model gs at 1au and less than 60k in model a5 .",
    "a similar trend is observed at other radii as well .",
    "deeper in the disk , temperature is less sensitive to the dust model .",
    "quite expectedly , midplane temperatures are somewhat higher in the more transparent disk with evolved dust .",
    "it is seen that the temperature range is bracketed by j4 and j20 spectra so further we consider only these cases .        in figure  [ hydro ] we present results for the disk in hydrostatic equilibrium , illuminated by the central object with spectra j4 and j20 .",
    "in addition to models gs and a5 , we also show density and temperature structure for the model with the same size distribution as in model a5 but with the upper size limit of 1 mm .",
    "it is seen that the upper limit of the grain size distribution does not change the density profile significantly , and corresponding curves in figure  [ hydro ] look very similar over the density drop of seven orders of magnitude .",
    "model with evolved dust and without uv continuum ( gs - j4 ) follows this trend as well .",
    "however , the curve for model gs - j20 goes above all the other curves , indicating that the disk is puffed up in this model .",
    "it should be noted that curves for model gs end at lower heights than other curves .",
    "dust density is very low at greater heights , and assumptions of our model break down .",
    "obviously , a more detailed consideration is needed with separate treatment of dust and gas temperatures .",
    "temperature profiles are more diverse .",
    "models with an upper grain size limit of 1 mm are the coldest ones , in agreement with previous studies .",
    "again , the importance of uv continuum is seen .",
    "for example , at 100au it makes disk warmer by @xmath42k in 1 mm model , by @xmath43k in model a5 , and by @xmath44k in model gs .",
    "this difference may not be strong enough to affect disk chemical composition , but it is of crucial importance for line transfer modeling .",
    "note also that temperature gradient in model with evolved dust is much greater than in well - mixed models .",
    "this may cause differences not only in line intensities but also in the underlying disk molecular content .",
    "uv irradiation of the disk coupled to the dust evolution also should have a profound effect on its molecular structure . to illustrate this",
    ", we use the disk models described above to compute photodissociation rates for cs and cn molecules ( figure  [ cncs ] ) , for which detailed frequency - dependent cross - sections are available @xcite .",
    "again , we only show results for j4 and j20 spectra .    obviously , photodissociation is much less effective in models without uv excess .",
    "photodissociation rate of cs is lower by six orders of magnitude , while photodissociation rate of cn is lower by nine orders of magnitude .",
    "also , these rates significantly depend on dust parameters , but this dependence is different for different molecules . for example , cn photodissociation rate reaches value of , say , @xmath45  s@xmath46 at @xmath47au in model a5-j20 and at @xmath48au in model gs - j20 . for cs photodissociation rate the corresponding height range is almost twice as large . such a different behavior is related to wavelength dependence of reaction cross - sections .",
    "molecules of cn are dissociated mostly by photons with @xmath49 , while cs molecules can be destroyed by photons with large @xmath50 . in model gs emission with longer wavelengths",
    "penetrates deeper into the disk due to dust settling , while emission with shorter wavelengths is effectively absorbed both in model a5 and in model gs .",
    "in this paper we study the influence of uv continuum on the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks .",
    "disk parameters ( thermal structure and chemical photoreaction rates ) may sensitively depend both on the mere presence of uv continuum , and on its exact shape .",
    "thus , the uv radiation affects disk observational appearance both in terms of continuum observations and molecular line observations .",
    "influence of uv irradiation onto the disk structure gets stronger as dust particles grow bigger at the initial phase of planet formation .",
    "thus , in order to interpret observations of a particular star+disk system its uv spectroscopy in the range of @xmath51  is greatly important , which makes future missions like wso - uv highly desirable @xcite .",
