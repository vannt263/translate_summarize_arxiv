    "topological defects have been extensively studied in condensed matter physics .",
    "one notable example is screw / edge - dislocations in liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the topological defects in liquid crystals can strongly influence the light - matter interaction @xcite .",
    "on one hand , the nematic disclinations may induce singularities in the light fields , generating optical beams with orbital angular momenta . on the other hand",
    ", strong light fields can imprint topological defects in liquid crystals , producing matter vortices @xcite .",
    "such interactions , however , are not sufficient to confine light at the defects and create optical resonances , due to small refractive index variation in the liquid crystals .    one efficient method of controlling light - matter interaction is to introduce a periodic modulation of the refractive index on the length scale of optical wavelength to make a photonic crystal @xcite . by introducing structural defects to the photonic crystals , light may be tightly confined and forming resonances with high quality factor @xcite .",
    "such defect cavities have also been used to manipulate light transport and generate optical vortices @xcite .",
    "in addition , plasmonic nanostructures have been designed to mold the electromagnetic energy flow on the nanoscale via the formation and interaction of vortex nanogears @xcite .",
    "these studies illustrate different ways of producing diversified optical flow patterns for integrated photonic circuits .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce topological defects to photonic crystals ( phcs ) .",
    "the unit cells are anisotropic and their orientations vary spatially to create topological defects in the orientational order . compared to the liquid crystal , the interaction of light with the topological defect is greatly enhanced , as the unit cell is much larger than the liquid crystal molecule and the refractive index contrast is much higher . instead of introducing disorder to the structural factor as the regular photonic crystal defects , we create disorder in the form factor . despite that the topological defect breaks the translational symmetry of the photonic crystal ,",
    "a residual photonic bandgap remains in the density of optical states .",
    "the band - edge states are dramatically modified in terms of spatial field profile and power flow pattern , e.g. , the energy flux may circulate around the topological defect instead of flowing outwards . to further enhance optical confinement",
    ", we create the photonic crystal defect modes in these structures , and show that they are distinct from the regular defect modes , e.g. they may generate power flow vortices .",
    "such characteristic features originate from the spatial variation of unit cell orientation .",
    "direction . ( b ) to introduce the topological defect , the major axis of each ellipse is rotated to an angle @xmath2 from the @xmath3-axis .",
    "@xmath4 is the polar angle of the center position of the ellipse . @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "away from the center , the ellipses in each of the four quadrant are aligned in the same direction , forming crystalline domains that rotate 90 degree from one quadrant to the next . ]",
    "we start with a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice of air cylinders in a dielectric host . the lattice constant is @xmath7 .",
    "the air cylinders have circular cross - section of radius @xmath8 .",
    "the refractive index of the dielectric host is @xmath9 .",
    "we calculate the photonic bands using the plane - wave expansion method @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2](a ) plots the first two bands of the transverse - electric ( te ) polarization ( electric field perpendicular to the cylinder axis ) for @xmath10 = 0.3 and @xmath9 = 2.83 .",
    "the photonic bandgaps ( pbgs ) are seen in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions , but they do not overlap to form a full ( isotropic ) gap at this filling fraction of dielectric material .",
    "next we make the unit cell anisotropic by deforming the cross - section of each cylinder to an ellipse [ fig . [",
    "fig1](a ) ] .",
    "the major axis of the ellipse is @xmath11 and the minor axis is @xmath12 . as the aspect ratio @xmath13 is varied , the cross - sectional area of the ellipse is kept constant and the structure has the same filling fraction of dielectric with the phc of circular unit cell .",
    "the photonic bands are modified , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) for @xmath13 = 1.4 .",
    "the bands in the @xmath14 direction ( parallel to the major axis of ellipse ) are blue shifted , whereas the bands in the @xmath15 direction ( parallel to the minor axis of ellipse ) are red shifted .",
    "this can be understood from the shrinking ( or expanding ) of the dielectric region between two adjacent air cylinders in the @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) direction , resulting in an decrease ( or increase ) of the effective refractive index for light propagating in the @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) direction .",
    "hence , the frequency degeneracy between the @xmath14 and @xmath15 band - edge modes is lifted by the deformation of the unit cell . the magnitude of their frequency splitting depends on the aspect ratio of the ellipses .",
    "the @xmath14 band - edge modes have electric field polarized in the @xmath16-direction ( @xmath17 ) , and the @xmath15 band - edge modes in the @xmath3-direction ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "such a square - lattice photonic crystal with elliptical shaped scattering units has been used to generate polarized optical beams from photonic crystal surface emitting lasers @xcite and as a polarization beam splitter @xcite .",
    "finally , we introduce the topological defect by rotating individual ellipses on the square lattice to different directions . following the configurations of wedge disclinations in liquid crystals ,",
    "the angle between the major axis of an ellipse to the @xmath3-axis is set to @xmath19 , where @xmath4 denotes the polar angle of the center position of the ellipse , @xmath20 is a half - integer or an integer that represents the topological charge , and @xmath21 is a constant .",
    "[ fig1](b ) shows such a structure with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which forms a structural vortex at the center .",
    "note that the center of the topological defect , which coincides with the origin of the 2d coordinates , is chosen to be in the middle of four adjacent cylinders .",
    "moving away from the center , the ellipses in each of the four quadrants are aligned in the same direction , albeit their direction rotate by 90 degree from one quadrant to the next .",
    "this structure is clearly non - periodic and does not possess any translational symmetry due to spatially varying orientation of the anisotropic unit cell .",
    "nevertheless , a residual photonic bandgap can be seen in the local density of optical states ( ldos ) at the center of the structure in fig . [ fig2](b ) .",
    "the ldos , @xmath24 $ ] , where @xmath25 is the green s function for the propagation of the magnetic field @xmath26 from point @xmath27 to @xmath28 . is calculated numerically with a commercial program comsol @xcite .",
    "the frequency range in which the ldos is suppressed coincides with the pbg in the @xmath0 direction [ fig . [ fig2](a ) ] .",

    "the elliptical cylinders occupy the same fraction of area , with aspect ratio @xmath29 .",

    "the drastic change in the energy flow can be explained by the orientation of the ellipses along the boundary of the defect region . in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , with circular cylinders , the waves propagating in the cw and ccw directions in the defect region experiences the same amount of scattering from the cylinders on the boundary . in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) , the orientation of the ellipses keeps changing along the boundary of the defect region , thus the cw and ccw waves experience different amounts of scattering , breaking the balance in amplitude between the cw and ccw waves . for the high-@xmath30 defect state , the cw wave experiences more scattering loss than the ccw wave , thus the net energy flow inside is ccw . to confirm this mechanism",
    ", we switch the major and minor axes of the ellipse , which is equivalent to rotate all the ellipses by 90 degree [ fig . [",
    "fig7](a ) ] . in this structure , the ccw wave experiences more scattering loss than the cw wave , thus the high-@xmath30 defect state is dominated by the cw wave , as confirmed from the flux pattern in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b )",
    "in summary , we introduce topological defect into a square - lattice of elliptical cylinders . although the translational symmetry is broken , the residual photonic bandgap effect is evident from the suppressed density of optical states , which results from the long - range positional order of the ellipses .",
    "the band - edge modes are strongly modified by the spatial variation of the ellipse orientation , both the field profile and energy flow are altered .",
    "for example , the high-@xmath30 mode located at the edge of @xmath0 bandgap splits into four regions of high intensity and the output flux becomes asymmetric due to spatially separated and rotated crystalline domains .",
    "the @xmath1 band - edge mode is also modified significantly and the energy flux circulates around the topological defect center .    to enhance the optical confinement",
    ", we remove the elliptical cylinders at the center to create localized states , in analogy to the photonic crystal defect states .",
    "such states are dominated by either cw or ccw circulating waves , due to unbalanced scattering loss from the elliptical cylinders at the boundary of the defect region .",
    "the flow direction can be switched by changing the ellipse orientation .",
    "the intrinsic optical vortices may be useful for modifying the motion of small particles or enhancing the interaction with chiral molecules for sensing applications .",
    "although this study is focused on a specific type of topological defect , we believe the photonic crystals with various types of topological defects can support diversified resonances with distinct characteristic .",
    "the deterministic aperiodic variation of the unit cell orientation adds another dimension to the control of light in a photonic crystal , enabling creation of desired field pattern and energy flow landscape .",
