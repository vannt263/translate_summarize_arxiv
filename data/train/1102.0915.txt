    "it has been announced in 1998 that type ia supernova observations indicate that the current universe is not only expanding but also accelerating .",
    "this was perhaps the most striking discovery of the modern cosmology .",
    "today , this behavior of the universe is confirmed by various independent observational data , including the type ia supernova ( snia ) , the large scale structure , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , and so on .",
    "there is a consensus on the conclusion that the universe has entered a state of accelerating expansion at redshift @xmath0 . in two recent studies by cunha and lima @xcite and cunha @xcite , the transition redshift to",
    "the accelerating expansion of the current universe has been examined using the kinematic approach to cosmological data analysis that provides a direct evidence to the present accelerating stage of the universe which does not depend neither on the validity of general relativity , nor on the matter - energy content of the universe .",
    "today we can examine not only when the cosmic acceleration began and the current value of the deceleration parameter , but also how the acceleration ( the deceleration parameter ) varies with time . in a recent paper , li et al .",
    "@xcite has examined the current acceleration of the universe by the largest and latest snia sample ( union2 ) , baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation together .",
    "they conclude that once the systematic error is taken into account , two different subsamples of union2 along with bao and cmb all favor an increase of the present cosmic acceleration .",
    "the authors also give plots they obtained for the change of the deceleration parameter @xmath1 with redshift @xmath2 .",
    "motivated from the studies outlined above , we propose here a linearly varying deceleration parameter ( lvdp ) , which can be used in obtaining accelerating cosmological solutions .",
    "as a special case , lvdp also covers the special law of variation for hubble parameter , which yields constant deceleration parameter ( cdp ) models of the universe , presented by berman @xcite .",
    "lvdp is consistent with the results of cunha , and exhibits a similar behavior to the one obtained by li et al .",
    "@xcite when we plot the deceleration parameter as a function of redshift . after the discovery of the late time acceleration of the universe",
    ", many authors have used cdp to obtain cosmological models in the context of dark energy ( de ) in general relativity and some other modified theories of gravitation such as @xmath3 theory within the framework of spatially isotropic and anisotropic spacetimes . however , generalizing cdp assumption would allow us to construct more precise cosmological models .",
    "indeed , as we show in this paper , a simple generalization of cdp ansatz to lvdp ansatz fits the recent observational results pretty well . in this paper , for convenience",
    ", we consider only the spatially homogenous and isotropic robertson - walker ( rw ) spacetimes and hence the perfect fluid representation for the energy - momentum tensor in the context of general relativity .",
    "the lvdp ansatz can also be used in spatially homogenous but anisotropic spacetimes and hence the imperfect fluids might also be considered in the context of general relativity , as well as generalized theories of gravity such as @xmath3 gravity .",
    "the einstein field equations can be written as follows , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the einstein tensor and @xmath6 is the energy - momentum tensor . to solve the einstein field equations it is usually necessary to make some simplifying assumptions such as choosing a metric with a significant degree of symmetry . in this paper",
    ", we consider the robertson - walker metric with a maximally symmetric spatial section , @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the cosmic scale factor and the spatial curvature index @xmath9 corresponds to spatially open , flat and closed universes , respectively . considering a co - moving fluid",
    ", the rw metric admits only the perfect fluid representation for the energy - momentum tensor , which can be written as follows , @xmath10\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the energy density and @xmath12 is the pressure of the fluid . in a comoving coordinate system , the einstein field equations ( 1 ) with ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , read as @xmath13",
    "@xmath14 this system consists of two equations but three unknowns ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , hence is not fully determined .",
    "one may determine the system fully by specifying a theory that determines a relation between the energy density and pressure of the fluid .",
    "most of the perfect fluids relevant to cosmology obey an equation of state of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the equation of state ( eos ) parameter , not necessarily constant .",
    "the three most common examples of cosmological fluids with constant @xmath19 are the dust ( @xmath20 ) , radiation ( @xmath21 ) and vacuum energy ( @xmath22 ) that is mathematically equivalent to cosmological constant @xmath23",
    ". it is well known that fluids with @xmath24 are usually considered in the context of de , since they give rise to accelerating expansion . besides the fluids with constant eos parameter with @xmath24 , particularly in the context of de ,",
    "there have been proposed various scalar field models that can be described by a time dependent @xmath19 that can evolve below the @xmath25 , e.g. , quintessence ( @xmath26 ) , phantom ( @xmath27 ) , quintom that can evolve across the cosmological constant boundary @xmath22 .",
    "however , we still do not have a perfect understanding of the eos of the de and sometimes it is useful to think about the einstein field equations without specifying the theory from which eos parameter @xmath19 is derived @xcite . hence , as an alternative , we may seek for the solutions of the einstein field equations under an ansatz or some anstze concerning the kinematics consistently with the observed kinematics of the universe",
    ". then one can derive an eos for the possible fluid that might be driving the expansion of the universe and particularly the current acceleration of the universe in the context of de .",
    "we may , then , check whether such a fluid is a realistic energy - momentum source or not and try to learn about the nature of the de . since the twice contracted bianchi identity ( @xmath28 ) assures the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor ( @xmath29 ) , we would be sure that the fluid would satisfy the energy - momentum conservation law .",
    "furthermore , we should require positivity of the energy density of the co - moving fluid @xmath30 to be satisfied as a condition for our fluid to be a realistic energy - momentum source .",
    "following a similar line of reasoning , berman @xcite and berman and gomide @xcite proposed in the 1980 s a law of variation for hubble parameter within the context of rw spacetimes in general relativity that yields constant deceleration parameter ( @xmath31 , where @xmath15 is the scale factor and @xmath32 is a constant ) . in berman s law",
    "the deceleration parameter can get values @xmath33 , and since @xmath34 corresponds to the accelerating expansion , many authors have studied cosmological models using this law in the context of de following the discovery of current acceleration of the universe . in this paper , we propose a generalized , linearly varying deceleration parameter @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath32 are constants .",
    "@xmath37 reduces ( [ eqn : qlaw ] ) to the law of berman @xcite .",
    "using this law one can generalize the cosmological solutions that are obtained via cdp .",
    "furthermore , one can obtain models that fit better the cosmological data .",
    "the universe would exhibit decelerating expansion if @xmath38 , an expansion with constant rate if @xmath39 , accelerating power - law expansion if @xmath40 , exponential expansion ( also known as de sitter expansion ) if @xmath41 and super - exponential expansion if @xmath42 ( see @xcite for super - exponential expansion ) .",
    "hence , the fastest rate of expansion under the cdp ansatz is the exponential expansion .",
    "however , with our lvdp ansatz the universe inevitably evolves into the super - exponential expansion phase unless @xmath37 , which is one of the possible fates of the universe according to the cosmological observations ( see @xcite ) .    solving ( [ eqn : qlaw ] ) one obtains three different form of solutions for the scale factor : @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are constants of integration .",
    "the last two of these solutions are for constant @xmath1 , and hence correspond to the solutions under cdp ansatz .",
    "we will not dwell on these but only on the first one , which is new . for convenience , in the following we consider the solution for @xmath52 and @xmath53 and omit the integration constant @xmath49 by setting @xmath54 . by doing this",
    ", we also set the initial time of the universe to @xmath55 .",
    "the reason for considering the solution only for @xmath52 and @xmath53 is not only for simplicity but also for compatibility with the observed universe .",
    "@xmath52 means we are dealing with increasing acceleration ( @xmath56 ) . because @xmath55 and @xmath52 , the only way to shift the deceleration parameter to values higher than @xmath57 is to set @xmath53 .",
    "we would like to note that here , before proceeding , if one would like the universe to commence with a decelerating expansion , one may tighten our ansatz by choosing @xmath58 . under the above considerations , ( [ eqn : scalefactor ] )",
    "is further reduced to @xmath59 now , using this , the hubble parameter of the universe is obtained as follows : @xmath60 substituting the scale factor ( [ eqn : sf ] ) in ( [ eqn : e1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : e2 ] ) we get the energy density @xmath61 and the pressure @xmath62 finally , using ( [ eqn : rho ] ) and ( [ eqn : p ] ) in ( [ eqn : eos ] ) the eos parameter of the fluid is obtained as follows : @xmath63    we also solve for the deceleration parameter @xmath1 as a function of the redshift @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the present value of the scale factor : @xmath66.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we know that @xmath67 for cdp ( i.e. , the @xmath37 case in our model ) . indeed , one may check that the choice @xmath37 reduces ( [ eqn : qz ] ) to @xmath68 .",
    "note that the above relation is independent of the spatial curvature .",
    "in our model the universe has finite lifetime .",
    "it starts with a big bang at @xmath55 and ends at @xmath69 .",
    "both of the energy density of the fluid and the scale factor diverge in finite time as @xmath70 .",
    "this is the big rip behavior first suggested by caldwell et al . @xcite .",
    "the universe begins with @xmath71 , enters into the accelerating phase ( @xmath72 ) at @xmath73 ( assuming @xmath58 ) , enters into super - exponential expansion phase ( @xmath42 ) at @xmath74 and ends with @xmath75 .",
    "one may observe that positivity condition on the energy density of the fluid is valid for the spatially closed and flat universes but violated for the spatially open universe ( the reason being that @xmath76 ) .",
    "hence , under the ansatz of lvdp ( [ eqn : qlaw ] ) , spatially closed and flat universes are possible while spatially open universe is impossible . it may be worthwhile to note that berman @xcite also reached the same conclusion .",
    "the eos parameter of the fluid exhibits different behaviors for spatially closed , flat and open models .",
    "however , in all of the three models @xmath77 at @xmath78 ( as would be expected ) and @xmath79 at @xmath80 .    within the context of general relativity , the current cosmological data from snia ( supernova legacy survey @xcite , gold sample of hubble space telescope @xcite ) , cmb ( wmap , boomerang ) @xcite and large scale structure ( sdss ) @xcite do not rule out de with a dynamical equation of state parameter that can evolve into the phantom region ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "this is consistent with our model .",
    "additionally , because the observational data allows de to pass into the phantom region , it means that the data also do not rule out the possibility of a big rip in future universe , which is also consistent with our model .    from model",
    "dependent or independent analyses of the cosmological observations in the literature @xcite , the transition redshift of the accelerating expansion is given by @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , the kinematic approach to cosmological data analysis provides a direct evidence to the present accelerating stage of the universe , which does not depend on the validity of general relativity , as well as on the matter - energy content of the universe @xcite . by assuming a spatially flat universe cunha @xcite finds that @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "now , to demonstrate how lvdp matches the observed kinematics of the universe and makes additional predictions , we first plot the cosmological parameters by choosing @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    in fig .",

    "this is what we expect , because we constrain the kinematics from the beginning but not the dynamics of the fluid .",
