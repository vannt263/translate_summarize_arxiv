    "to collect the largest possible samples of blue stragglers and comparison stars for low - luminosity globular clusters , we used high quality ground - based photometry from the literature and photometry from the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ archives ( all using the wfpc2 camera ) . in all cases , we chose datasets with little photometric scatter at the turnoff , so that contamination of the blue straggler sample by normal main sequence stars was minimal .",
    "all _ hst _ data was reduced in a uniform manner using the hstphot package @xcite .",
    "our final sample consists of 13 globular clusters with @xmath6 ( 9 with hst data ) .",
    "color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for the primary _ hst _ fields are shown in fig . [ cmds ] .",
    "the blue stragglers discussed here are all brighter than the cluster turnoff and bluer ( by 0.05 in @xmath7 ) , and there was typically no difficulty with field star contamination of the portion of the cmd populated by stragglers . although most of our straggler identifications are based on @xmath8 colors ( as opposed to @xmath9 for p04 ) , there were few stars for which the choice of color could affect the selection . in some clusters , a significant field star population redder than the cluster turnoff and brighter than the subgiant branch made it impractical to use cluster giants as a comparison population ,",
    "so we used hb stars instead . clusters with large field contamination could sometimes be used if they had blue hb morphologies .",
    "the complete sample of blue stragglers and hb stars will be presented in a companion paper .",
    "we also examined the blue straggler populations of two well - studied old open clusters : m67 and ngc 188 .",
    "both of these clusters have extensive proper motion membership information available that allows us to identify stragglers , and to estimate the absolute magnitude of the cluster by summing the fluxes of member stars ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively ) .",
    "we have also estimated the central luminosity densities ( @xmath12 and 2.2 , respectively ) using structural information from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although these clusters have lower ages ( and more luminous stars on average ) , these two clusters have characteristics comparable to the faintest globular clusters .    p04 used two measures to judge the relative frequency of blue stragglers in a cluster : the population ratio @xmath13 , and the number of stragglers per absolute visual flux unit @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "[ fbss ] , we plot @xmath15   versus absolute cluster magnitude and central density .",
    "values for these cluster properties were taken from the compilation of @xcite . with the inclusion of data for these 13 clusters ,",
    "we extend the cluster sample fainter about 3 magnitudes in @xmath16 and more than 3 orders of magnitude in central density .",
    "the significant anti - correlation between @xmath15   and @xmath16 seen by p04 continues to the low luminosity end of the sample .",
    "that end is anchored by the clusters e 3 ( @xmath17 ) and palomar 13 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "e 3 has no known hb stars ( one unconfirmed candidate ) , and so produces a lower limit .",
    "the majority of the clusters have higher relative frequencies than all but a handful of the clusters in the p04 sample .",
    "( we also examined the cluster m71 , which was the faintest cluster in the p04 data , to verify that our straggler selection produced a straggler frequency equal to theirs to within the errors . )",
    "none of the clusters examined here has @xmath15@xmath19 , which is a noticeable departure from the behavior of more luminous clusters in spite of the significant variations from cluster to cluster .    although the open clusters that we have been able to include are significantly younger than the globular clusters in the sample ( 4 gyr for m67 , 6 gyr for ngc 188 ) , they appear to follow the relation defined by the globular clusters , and agree with the high value found for pal 13 . we have used red clump stars ( in ngc 188 , including two blue subdwarfs ) as the comparison populations for the open clusters ,",
    "but this should not be an issue since the lifetimes of stars in this phase is within about 10% of the lifetimes of red hb stars in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "this puts the open cluster straggler populations in a new context  normal for their total masses , not abnormally large .",
    "because our sample of low - luminosity clusters also contains some of the lowest density clusters , we compare to the population of field blue stragglers @xcite .",
    "the prevalence of single - lined low - eccentricity spectroscopic binaries in the field sample implies that stable binary mass transfer is the main production mechanism among field stars .",
    "( coalescence of close binaries like w uma systems would produce the rest . )",
    "the 4 lowest - luminosity clusters in our sample are known to have binary fractions comparable to that of field stars , based on precise photometry of the main sequence [ @xmath20 for pal 13 @xcite ; @xmath21 for e3 @xcite ; @xmath22 for m67 @xcite ; @xmath23 for ngc 188 @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite found that low - luminosity ( @xmath24 ) globular clusters have larger @xmath15   values than higher luminosity clusters and estimated that @xmath15@xmath25 in the field .",
    "we find that _ only _ the four least luminous clusters have bss frequencies that are consistent with ( palomar 13 , m67 , ngc 188 ) or exceed ( e3 ) the preston & sneden estimate for the field .",
    "thus it seems that all but the least luminous globular clusters are less efficient at producing stragglers than the field .",
    "binary systems that transfer mass are quite `` hard '' systems with binding energies that are considerably larger than kinetic energies of the stars they encounter in most clusters @xcite .",
    "a figure of merit is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are masses of the binary components and the average single star , @xmath30 is the binary separation , and @xmath31 is the cluster velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the boundary between `` hard '' and `` soft '' binaries is @xmath32 , while mass transfer binaries in the clusters described here have @xmath33 . in general",
    ", such hard binaries should survive in a cluster and produce stragglers via mass transfer .",
    "do stellar collisions still produce stragglers though ?    for the nearby open clusters , studies of _ individual _ blue stragglers provide information on the formation mechanisms . in ngc 188",
    ", the straggler pkm 4330 has a high membership probability ( @xmath34% ; platais et al .",
    "2003 ) , but stands more than 3 magnitudes above the turnoff magnitude , which probably means it has more than twice the turnoff mass and results from a multi - star collision .",
    "there is a much larger body of information on m67 stars . like pkm 4330 ,",
    "the brightest straggler ( s977 ) appears to have a mass more than twice the cluster turnoff mass .",
    "there are many variable blue stragglers , including s1036 ( w uma variable ) , s1082 ( rs cvn variable , x - ray source , possible triple system containing _ two _ blue stragglers ) , and s1280 and s1284 ( @xmath35 scuti pulsators , s1284 in a short - period eccentric binary ) .",
    "several more blue stragglers are in long - period spectroscopic binaries : s752 , s975 , and s1195 ( low - eccentricity orbits , s975 with hot companion ) , and s1267 and s997 ( eccentric orbits ) .",
    "roughly half of these systems probably formed via normal binary mass transfer ( s752 , s975 , s1036 , and s1195 ) , but an equally large number of systems probably require a collisional mechanism involving more than 2 stars ( most notably , s977 , s997 , s1082 , s1267 , and s1284 ) gyr ; @xcite ) , we must keep in mind that these stragglers would have evolved and died by the time the cluster s age reached that of a globular cluster ( @xmath36 gyr ) . ] .",
    "the clusters in this study reveal a continuation of the strong anti - correlation between straggler frequency and cluster luminosity seen by p04 , and a break in the weaker anti - correlation with cluster density ( lower panel of fig .",
    "an important question is whether the dependence on cluster density has physical meaning or whether it is an artifact of a correlation between cluster properties .",
    "[ pars ] shows the relation between integrated magnitude and central density @xcite .",
    "the similarity of this plot and the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fbss ] leads us to believe that the density relationship is an artifact  the clusters e3 and pal 13 most clearly stand out as clusters with high straggler frequencies , low luminosity , and relatively high central densities .",
    "low - luminosity clusters ( @xmath37 ) cover almost the entire range of central densities , while straggler frequencies remain uniformly high .",
    "we must keep in mind that for most of the clusters surveyed by p04 the blue straggler samples are mostly confined to the core , and selection effects in the p04 cluster sample ( aside from @xmath6 ) may influence the interpretation of these figures .",
    "however , central density is not as good a predictor of the size of the straggler population as integrated cluster luminosity .",
    "does this mean that strong gravitational interactions between stars are unimportant in the production of stragglers in low - luminosity clusters ? as mentioned in  [ field ] , a significant fraction of stragglers in m67 are in binaries showing evidence of strong multiple - star interactions .",
    "stars at the bright end of the straggler luminosity function should also reflect the relative importance of stellar collisions and binary coalescences since mass transfer is very unlikely to be 100% efficient during the formation of a straggler in a wide binary .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ cmds ] , the clusters in our low - luminosity sample still produced a substantial fraction of stragglers at the high luminosity end ( more than 10% have @xmath38 ) .",
    "9 of the 13 globular clusters ( as well as m71 ) and both open clusters have at least one straggler more than 2 magnitudes brighter than the turnoff , implying a collision of at least three stars .    we can attempt to qualitatively understand the problem by examining the timescale for collisions @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the dominant factor in @xmath39 is number density ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "our cluster sample covers more than three orders of magnitude in central density , and when combined with the sample of p04 , the total range is more than six orders of magnitude .",
    "so , it might be tempting to believe that the near constancy of @xmath15   for many clusters with @xmath41 is an indication that primordial binary star mechanisms dominate and strong interactions have become unimportant .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath31 is also a few times lower for low - luminosity clusters compared to most clusters in the p04 sample : from a maximum of 2.4 km s@xmath42for ngc 6535 @xcite to @xmath43 km s@xmath42for palomar 13 @xcite and 0.8 km s@xmath42for m67 @xcite , to @xmath44 km s@xmath42for palomar 5 @xcite .",
    "low encounter velocities increase the time between interactions but more strongly increase the probability of collision via gravitational focusing , so that @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "velocity dispersion only varies by a factor of about 100 among all milky way globular clusters , so its effects on the timescale are usually overwhelmed by those of cluster density .",
    "the velocity dispersion has a larger effect on the statistical properties of the binary star population though .",
    "as velocity dispersion decreases , wider binaries qualify as `` hard '' ( @xmath46 ) . for @xmath47 km s@xmath48 ,",
    "the hard - soft boundary is already at several au . for most globular clusters ( and all of the ones in the present sample ) , binary systems that would ultimately produce blue stragglers via mass transfer in a giant evolutionary phase are likely to survive due to their hardness , even though collisions are fairly frequent . for the moment , we only consider collisions ( i.e. strong gravitational interactions ) involving binaries , and not physical collisions of stars . in a cluster like ngc 6535 at the bright end of our sample , the collision timescale for the largest binaries that transfer mass in the giant phase implies that they have a few collisions in the age of the cluster .",
    "( keep in mind that these collision timescales use central densities , and so are overestimates for the cluster as a whole . )    for lower luminosity clusters , there are competing effects .",
    "lower velocity dispersion allows wider binaries to survive to the present day .",
    "photometric measurements of large binary fractions among some of the low - luminosity clusters in our sample @xcite support this .",
    "lower cluster density increases the collision timescale for binaries of a given size , although this is partly offset by lower @xmath31 and increased gravitational focussing .",
    "however , the changes in the nature of the binary population ( increased binary fraction and increased average orbital separation ) help enhance the overall binary collision rate .",
    "the collision timescale for binaries at the hard - soft boundary has @xmath49 , which allows lower velocity dispersion to partially cancel the effects of lower number density .",
    "if we assume that the present - day binary period distribution is uniform in @xmath50 between a minimum period ( set by star sizes ) and the hard - soft boundary , then the typical binary involved in a strong interaction will have @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are orbital separations of the hardest binaries and the hard - soft boundary , respectively .",
    "thus , the collision timescale for these systems should only be a factor of @xmath54 more than the collision timescale for binary systems at the hard - soft boundary .",
    "a strong interaction involving a close binary is very likely to produce at least one physical collision of stars ( @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the critical velocity needed to unbind the binary ; fregeau et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , for wide but hard binaries in low - mass clusters , the main sequence star components present small targets compared to the binary . for a ratio of stellar radius to orbital separation @xmath57 ,",
    "the cross section for collisions decreases approximately as @xmath58 , according to figure 9 of @xcite . because the binary collision timescale @xmath59 , the timescale for stellar collisions involving binaries then _ decreases _ slowly with increasing @xmath30",
    "a combination of effects may therefore conspire to produce a significant number of stellar collisions involving binaries even within low luminosity clusters .",
    "the lack of a stronger correlation between @xmath15   and central density may result from the effects of changing velocity dispersion and binary population .",
    "this might also partially explain the apparent lack of correlation between @xmath15   and the probability @xmath60 that a given star will have a collision in one year ( p04 ) since the calculation of @xmath60 from king models does not account for changes in the binary star distributions between clusters .",
    "populations of low - luminosity x - ray sources in globular clusters [ such as quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries ( qlmxbs ) , cataclysmic variables , and millisecond pulsars ] appear to behave differently .",
    "@xcite found strong correlations between number of sources and normalized encounter rate @xmath61 , and @xcite identified probable qlmxbs that are consistent with predictions based on tidal capture or exchanges during multiple star interactions .",
    "it is not clear that this is consistent with the scenario of @xcite in which massive stars exchange into previously - existing binaries in the most massive clusters , forming stragglers that die off before the present day .",
    "the blue straggler and low - luminosity x - ray populations may be giving us complimentary information about the importance of collisions and the prevalence of binaries in star clusters .",
    "we suggest two directions to disentangle the important factors driving the dynamical evolution of clusters .",
    "first , the binary star populations of more clusters need to be observationally characterized  particularly the binary fraction and the period distribution .",
    "second , models of cluster evolution that examine the production of stragglers and x - ray sources are needed .",
    "the recent hybrid models ( binary population synthesis with dynamics ) of @xcite provide some guidance , although they modelled clusters that are denser and more massive than the ones in our sample .",
    "they find that the present - day core binary fraction is inversely related to cluster density , and that the binary period distribution remains nearly flat in @xmath62 up to periods of @xmath63 d and more for their lowest - density clusters .",
    "the low - luminosity clusters examined in this study make perfect subjects for numerical studies of cluster dynamics with current generations of computer codes .",
