    "for nearly one hundred years , fourier functions have been used to determine the pulsation period , @xmath1 , of regular variables .",
    "@xcite were able to show that other useful information apart from the period could be derived from fourier functions .",
    "their format of the relation is commonly used : @xmath3 where the terms @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the fourier coefficients of the fit of degree @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "generally the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 were ignored when this function was used to determine the value of @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite showed that these terms when combined in the following manner  @xmath8 and @xmath9 , could provide more information about pulsating variables than at first thought .",
    "currently , the coefficients derived from the light curves of cepheids and rr lyrae have been used to provide information about pulsation modes and resonance effects , as well as physical characteristics of the stars such as mass , luminosity , and metallicity .",
    "jurcsik & kovcs ( 1996 , hereafter jk96 ) surveyed field ab - type rr lyrae ( rrab ) and derived a relationship between @xmath1 , @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] for these variables which has been used in a variety of applications , in particular to determine the metallicity of stars found in large scale surveys ( morgan , simet & bargenquast 1998 , hereafter msb98 ) , in globular clusters ( cacciari , corwin & carney 2005 ) and in other galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite describes this relationship as an aspect of the oosterhoff ",
    "preston period - metallicity effect , in which the apparent shift of the value of @xmath1 or @xmath0 is dependent upon the influence metallicity has on horizontal branch morphology .",
    "@xcite expanded upon the work of jk96 by investigating possible relationships between the physical parameters of rrab stars and other fourier coefficients .",
    "they found several trends in the value of photometric colours and magnitudes with the coefficients .",
    "the utilization of the fourier coefficients of the c - type rr lyrae variables ( rrc ) has not been as extensive as that of the rrab stars .",
    "@xcite used hydrodynamic models of rrc stars to show relationships exist between the values of helium abundance ( @xmath10 ) , luminosity , mass , @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , he found that @xmath0 is directly related to the luminosity - mass ratio , @xmath11 , for these stars .",
    "@xcite showed that the distribution of @xmath0 with period would vary according to oosterhoff group , with oosterhoff i cluster stars having larger values of @xmath0 for a given value of @xmath1 than stars from oosterhoff ii clusters .",
    "clement , jankulak & simon ( 1992 ) found strong evidence for the trend of @xmath0 increasing with period in their observations of several globular clusters , and also noted the trend for lower metallicity clusters to have their @xmath0 values shifted to longer periods than the higher metallicity clusters on a @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram .",
    "this result was also observed in the rrc variables in ngc 4590 ( m68 ) by clement , ferance & simon ( 1993 ) .",
    "the general nature of this aspect of the variation of @xmath0 with metallicity has previously been used to estimate the metallicity of rrc stars in the ogle surveys of the galactic bulge ( msb98 ) and toward 47 tuc @xcite , however these results were at best only general approximations of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the lack of a metallicity relationship for the rrc stars analogous to that derived by jk96 is likely due to the scarcity of accurate metallicity and light curve data for field rrc variables .",
    "generally metallicities for field rrc stars are estimated using the @xmath12 method of @xcite , with only a few metallicities derived from high resolution spectroscopy @xcite . in several cases , @xmath12 values obtained for",
    "a single rrc star can vary significantly , making the accuracy of the metallicity for such stars suspect .",
    "fortunately , there is an abundance of data for globular cluster rrc variables , including values for cluster metallicity and a significant number of fourier coefficients .",
    "we will use these data to derive relationships for rrc stars relating the fourier coefficient @xmath0 , pulsation period and [ fe / h ] .",
    "the resulting relations will also be applied to several test cases , including field rrc stars , as well as variables in @xmath2 cen , the large magellanic cloud and toward the galactic bulge .",
    "the fourier coefficients for globular cluster rrc variables were obtained from the fourier coefficient website @xcite as well as several recent publications .",
    "the clusters used here are listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] . in order to avoid possible errors with conversion from one photometric system to another ,",
    "only fourier coefficients derived from @xmath13 magnitudes were considered . where ever possible the light curve data for the individual stars were examined and fourier fits that were based upon sparsely sampled light curves or with poorly defined maxima / minima were excluded .",
    "fourier coefficients with large uncertainties were also excluded .",
    "the sources for the fourier coefficients , and the number of stars from each cluster ultimately used in this study are included in table  [ tbl-1 ] as well .",
    "there are several sources for metallicity that could be used for globular clusters .",
    "two metallicity scales that are frequently cited in the literature are those of zinn & west ( 1984 , hereafter zw84 ) and carretta & gratton ( 1997 , hereafter cg97 ) . both of these metallicity scales will be used here .",
    "for some clusters , the updated values from @xcite are used in place of the zw84 values where available . when values were not available for clusters based on the system of cg97 , the values found by zw84",
    "were converted to the cg97 scale using the relation of @xcite .",
    "the metallicity values and their corresponding uncertainties are also given in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    ".globular clusters containing rrc stars with reliable fourier coefficients . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     two criteria were used for determining which formulae would be the most useful for calculating rrc metallicities .",
    "first was the quality of the fit to the data , which is summarized in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the second criterion was the simplicity of the formula .",
    "this criterion was only relevant for the cg97 solutions , where the quality of the formula varied insignificantly when the number of terms used in the solution were changed .",

    "the average difference between the [ fe / h ] values from zw84 and cg97 and those based upon the above relations is approximately @xmath24 dex , indicating that these relations provide values for the metallicity that are within the range of uncertainty found using a variety of other methods .",
    "lines of constant value of [ fe / h ] based upon equations  [ zwfit ] and [ cgfit ] are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , along with the original data from figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the non - linear nature of equation  [ zwfit ] limits the range of values where the function is defined in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the lines follow the general metallicity trends seen in the two metallicity systems .",
    "average metallicities for all of the variables in each cluster listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] based upon equations  [ zwfit ] and [ cgfit ] are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",

    "ngc 7089 ( m2 ) is the most displaced cluster in figure  [ fig5 ] , with two of its three stars having relatively high calculated metallicities compared to the values of zw84 and cg97 .",
    "this results in an average metallicity for ngc 7089 that is @xmath27 and @xmath28 dex greater than the zw84 and cg97 values respectively .    , based upon the fits to the zw84 ( equation  [ zwfit ] ) and the cg97 ( equation  [ cgfit ] ) metallicity scales are shown , along with the rrc data from figure  [ fig1 ] .",

    "field rrc stars were examined first .",
    "the number of field rrc stars with [ fe / h ] values and good quality @xmath13 magnitude light curves that could be used is very small , comprised of only 15 stars .",
    "[ fe / h ] values for the stars were taken either from @xcite or were calculated using published @xmath12 values and the @xmath12 - [ fe / h ] relation of @xcite .",

    "the estimated uncertainty of the individual values of [ fe / h ] from the literature varies with each source , but typical uncertainties are @xmath20 dex or less .",
