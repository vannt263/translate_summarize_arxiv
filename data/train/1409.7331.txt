    "note that the collection of centers of the balls of the boolean model is a homogeneous poisson point process on @xmath1 with intensity @xmath15 , and that the radii of the distinct balls are i.i.d .  with law @xmath16 , and independent of the point process of the centers . in our study",
    ", we focus on the boolean model with deterministic radii ( when @xmath3 is a dirac mass @xmath17 , with @xmath18 ) and on the boolean model with two distinct radii ( when @xmath3 is a weighted sum of two dirac masses ) .",
    "we say that @xmath10 percolates if the probability that there is an unbounded connected component of @xmath10 that contains the origin is positive .",
    "this is equivalent to the almost - sure existence of an unbounded connected component of @xmath10 .",
    "we refer to the book by meester and roy @xcite for background on continuum percolation .",
    "the critical intensity is defined by : @xmath19 one easily checks that @xmath20 is finite , and in @xcite it is proven that @xmath20 is positive if and only  if @xmath21 we assume that this assumption is fulfilled .    by ergodicity , the boolean model @xmath10 has a deterministic natural density .",
    "this is also the probability that a given point belongs to the boolean model and it is given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the volume of the unit ball in @xmath1 .",
    "the critical covered volume @xmath24 is the density of the boolean model when the intensity is critical : @xmath25 unlike the critical intensity @xmath26 , the critical covered volume @xmath27 is invariant under scaling . for all @xmath28 , let @xmath29 be the image of @xmath3 under the map defined by @xmath30 .",
    "we have the following scaling property : @xmath31 indeed , a critical boolean model remains critical when rescaling and the density is invariant by rescaling .",
    "more formally , this invariance of the critical covered volume @xmath27 under rescaling is a consequence of proposition 2.11 in @xcite .",
    "note for example that for any @xmath18 , @xmath32 one also easily checks the following invariance property : for all @xmath28 , @xmath33 .    practically , we study the critical covered volume through the normalized critical intensity : @xmath34 we then have @xmath35 .",
    "the factor @xmath36 may seem arbitrary here , its interest will appear in the statement of the next theorems .",
    "note also that the normalized critical intensity @xmath37 is also invariant under rescaling .",
    "it has been conjectured by kertsz and vicsek  @xcite that the normalized critical intensity should be independent of @xmath3 , as soon as the support of @xmath3 is bounded .",
    "phani and dhar @xcite gave a heuristic argument suggesting that the conjecture were false .",
    "a rigorous proof was then given by meester , roy and sarkar in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , they gave examples of measures @xmath3 with two atoms such that : @xmath38 as a consequence of theorem 1.1 in the paper by menshikov , popov and vachkovskaia  @xcite , we even get that @xmath39 can be arbitrarily large . on the contrary ,",
    "theorem 2.1 in @xcite gives the existence of a positive constant @xmath40 , that depends only on the dimension @xmath41 , such that , for all @xmath3 satisfying : @xmath42 to sum up , @xmath43 is not bounded from above but is bounded from below by a positive constant . in other words , the critical covered volume @xmath44 can be arbitrarily close to @xmath45 but is bounded from below by a positive constant .",
    "it is thus natural to seek optimal measures , that is the ones which minimize the normalized critical intensity , or equivalently , the critical covered volume .    in the physical literature , it is strongly believed that , at least when @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the critical covered volume is minimum in the case of a deterministic radius , that is when the distribution of radii is a dirac measure .",
    "this conjecture is supported by numerical evidence ( to the best of our knowledge , the most accurate estimations are given in a paper by quintanilla and ziff @xcite when @xmath46 and in a paper by consiglio , baker , paul and stanley @xcite when @xmath47 ) .",
    "on figure [ f : multiscale ] , we plot the critical covered volume in dimension 2 as a function of @xmath48 and for different values of @xmath49 when @xmath50 .",
    "the data for finite values of @xmath49 come from numerical estimations in @xcite , while the data for the limit of @xmath49 going to infinity come from the study of the multi - scale boolean model in @xcite . see section 1.4 in @xcite for further references .     for different values of @xmath49 .",
    "> from bottom to top : @xmath51 and the limit as @xmath52 .",
    "]    the conjecture is also supported by some heuristic arguments in any dimension ( see for example dhar  @xcite , and balram and dhar  @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    ", it is noted that the rigorous proof of suggests that the deterministic case might be optimal for any @xmath5 . in this paper",
    "we show on the contrary that for all @xmath41 large enough the critical covered volume is not minimized by the case of deterministic radii .",
    "assume here that the measure @xmath3 is a dirac mass at @xmath45 , that is that the radii of the balls are all equal to @xmath45 .",
    "penrose proved the following result in @xcite :    [ t : penrose ] @xmath53    with the scale invariance of @xmath54 , this limit can readily be generalized to any constant radius : for any @xmath18 , @xmath55 theorem [ t : penrose ] is the continuum analogue of a result of kesten @xcite for bernoulli bond percolation on the nearest - neighbor integer lattice @xmath56 , which says that the critical percolation parameter is asymptotically equivalent to @xmath57 .",
    "let us say a word about the ideas of the proof of theorem [ t : penrose ] .",
    "the inequality @xmath58 holds for any @xmath5 .",
    "the proof is simple , and here is the idea .",
    "we consider the following natural genealogy . the deterministic ball @xmath59 is said to be the ball of generation @xmath60 . the random balls of @xmath61 that touch @xmath59 are then the balls of generation @xmath45 .",
    "the random balls that touch one ball of generation @xmath45 without being one of them are then the balls of generation @xmath62 and so on .",
    "let us denote by @xmath63 the number of all balls that are descendants of @xmath59 .",
    "there is no percolation if and only if @xmath63 is almost surely finite",
    ".    now denote by @xmath64 the poisson distribution with mean @xmath65 : this is the law of the number of balls of @xmath66 that touch a given ball of radius @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , if there were no interference between children of different balls , @xmath63 would be equal to @xmath67 , the total population in a galton - watson process with offspring distribution @xmath64 . because of the interferences due to the fact that the boolean model lives in @xmath1 , this is not true : in fact , @xmath63 is only stochastically dominated by @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath68 , then @xmath67 is finite almost surely , so @xmath63 is finite almost surely and therefore there is no percolation .",
    "this implies @xmath69 the difficult part of theorem [ t : penrose ] is to prove that if @xmath41 is large , then the interferences are small , so @xmath63 is close to @xmath67 and therefore there is percolation for large @xmath41 as soon as @xmath70 is a constant strictly larger than one .    to sum up , at first order ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the critical intensity of the boolean model with constant radius is given by the threshold of the associated galton - watson process , as in the case of bernoulli percolation on @xmath56 : roughly speaking , as the dimension increases , the geometrical constraints of the finite dimension space decrease and at the limit , we recover the non - geometrical case of the corresponding galton - watson process .",
    "let @xmath71 .",
    "set @xmath72 if @xmath73 is an integer , we define the normalized measure @xmath74 on @xmath4 by setting : @xmath75 we will study the behavior of @xmath76 as @xmath41 tends to infinity .",
    "let us motivate the definition of @xmath74 with the following two related properties :    1 .",
    "consider the boolean model @xmath77 on @xmath1 driven by @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "the number of balls of @xmath77 with radius @xmath45 that contains a given point is a poisson random variable with intensity @xmath80 .",
    "the number of balls of @xmath77 with radius @xmath49 that contains a given point is also a poisson random variable with intensity @xmath80 . loosely speaking",
    ", this means that contrary to what happens in the boolean model driven by @xmath81 , the relative importance of the two types of radii does not depend on the dimension @xmath41 in the boolean model driven by @xmath82 .",
    "a closely related property is the following one .",
    "consider two independent boolean model @xmath0 and @xmath83 , both driven by @xmath84 .",
    "then @xmath85 is a boolean model driven by @xmath78 .",
    "[ t:2 ] let @xmath86 .",
    "set as before @xmath87 .",
    "then @xmath88    note that as @xmath86 , @xmath89 .",
    "the following result is then an immediate consequence of theorem [ t : penrose ] and theorem [ t:2 ] .",
    "[ t : conjecture ] if the dimension @xmath41 is large enough , then there exists a probability measure @xmath3 on @xmath4 such that : @xmath90 in other words , the conjecture is false in high dimensions .",
    "we end this section by some remarks :    * one can easily extend theorem [ t:2 ] as follows .",
    "let @xmath91 .",
    "set @xmath92 and assume @xmath86 .",
    "then @xmath93 * as we will see in the proof , the critical threshold @xmath94 is given by the critical parameter of an associated two - types galton - watson process when @xmath95 ; we prove in a companion paper @xcite that this is not the case for @xmath96 .",
    "* if one does not normalize the distribution one has .",
    "the lower bound can be proven using the easy part of the comparison with a two - type galton - watson process . ]",
    "@xmath97 and thus @xmath98 .",
    "this behavior is due to the fact that , without normalization , the influence of the small balls vanishes in high dimension .",
    "fix @xmath86 and @xmath99 . once the dimension @xmath100 is given , we consider two independent stationary poisson point processes on @xmath1 : @xmath101 and @xmath102 , with respective intensities @xmath103 to @xmath101 and @xmath104 , we respectively associate the two boolean models @xmath105 we focus on the percolation properties of the following two - type boolean model @xmath106 this boolean model is driven by the measure @xmath107 where @xmath74 is defined as before by",
    ". remember that @xmath108          the proof is very similar to the easy part of the proof of theorem [ t : penrose ] .",
    "the only difference is that we consider a two - types galton - watson process instead of a one - type galton - watson process .",
    "therefore , we only sketch the proof and refer to @xcite for a more detailed proof .",
    "the idea is to consider the following natural genealogy . the deterministic ball @xmath110 is said to be the ball of generation @xmath60 . the random balls of @xmath0 that touch @xmath110 are then the balls of generation @xmath45 .",
    "they can be of two different types : either of radius @xmath45 or of radius @xmath49 .",
    "the random balls that touch one ball of generation @xmath45 without being one of them are then the balls of generation @xmath62 and so on .    this genealogical process is stochastically dominated by a two - types gatson - watson process .",
    "basically , the galton - watson process is obtained by neglecting the geometrical constraints due to the fact that the boolean model lives in @xmath111 .",
    "it is defined as follows .",
    "start with one individual of type @xmath49 .",
    "the offspring distribution of type @xmath45 of an individual of type @xmath49 is defined to be the distribution of the number of balls of @xmath112 that intersect a given deterministic ball of radius @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , it is a poisson random variable with mean @xmath113 .",
    "the other offspring distributions are defined similarly .",
    "the matrix of means of offspring distributions is thus given by : @xmath114 let @xmath115 denote the largest eigenvalue of @xmath116 .",
    "the extinction probability of the two - types galton - watson process is @xmath45 if and only if @xmath117 .",
    "we have : @xmath118 as @xmath119 , we get that the galton - watson process is subcritical for large enough @xmath41 . therefore , for large enough @xmath41",
    ", the total progeny of the galton - watson process is almost surely finite .",
    "thus , almost surely , there is no infinite cluster of the boolean model @xmath0 that touches @xmath110 . as a consequence ,",
    "almost surely , there is no infinite cluster in the boolean model @xmath0 .        for every @xmath120",
    ", we set @xmath121 if @xmath122 is even and @xmath123 otherwise .",
    "we say that alternating percolation occurs if there exists an infinite sequence of distinct points @xmath124 in @xmath1 such that , for every @xmath125 :      in other words , alternating percolation occurs if there exists an infinite path along which balls of radius @xmath45 alternate with balls of radius @xmath49 .",
    "the aim of this subsection is to prove the following proposition :      by a straightforward coupling argument , one sees that it is sufficient to prove the proposition under the following assumptions on @xmath129 : @xmath130 we make this assumption in the remaining of this subsection .",
    "we will prove that alternating percolation occurs in the two - type boolean model in the supercritical case by embedding in the boolean model a supercritical @xmath62-dimensional oriented percolation process .",
    "we thus specify the two first coordinates , and introduce the following notations . when @xmath131 , for any @xmath132 , we write @xmath133 we write @xmath134 for the open euclidean ball of @xmath135 with center @xmath136 and radius @xmath137 .",
    "in the same way we denote by @xmath138 the open euclidean ball of @xmath139 with center @xmath140 and radius @xmath137 .",
    "the point here is to define the event that will govern the opening of the edges in the @xmath62-dimensional oriented percolation process : it is naturally linked to the existence of a finite path composed of a ball of radius @xmath45 and a ball of radius @xmath49 .",
    "we define , for a given dimension @xmath131 , the two following subsets of @xmath1 : @xmath141 for @xmath142 we set : @xmath143 our goal here is to prove that the probability of occurrence of this event is asymptotically large :      note already that by translation invariance , @xmath147 does not depend on @xmath148 , so we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath149 .",

    "note that a direct calculus with spherical coordinates can also give the announced estimates .",

    "consider a random vector @xmath200 of points in @xmath1 defined as follows : @xmath201 is taken uniformly in @xmath202 , then @xmath203 is taken uniformly in @xmath204 .",
    "we think of @xmath205 as a potential single branch of progeny of @xmath206 .",
    "let then @xmath207 be independent copies of @xmath205 .",
    "let now @xmath208 be an independent poisson random variable with parameter @xmath209 : this random variable gives the number @xmath210 of children of @xmath206 .",
    "we will use the @xmath208 first @xmath211 , one for each child of @xmath206 .",
    "we now take into account the fact that some individuals may have no children .",
    "we shall deal with geometric dependencies later .",
    "let @xmath212 be an independent family of independent random variables , such that @xmath213 follows the bernoulli law with parameter @xmath214 , which is the probability that a poisson random variable with parameter @xmath215 is different from @xmath60 .",
    "we set @xmath216 and @xmath217 thus the random set @xmath218 gives the superscripts of the individuals , among the @xmath208 individuals of the first generation , that have at least one child in a process with no dependencies due to geometry .    to take into account the geometrical constraints between individuals , we set , for every @xmath219",
    ", @xmath220 we thus reject an individual @xmath221 as soon as @xmath222 .",
    "recall that , when building generation @xmath62 from generation @xmath45 , we explore the poisson point processes in the area @xmath223 .",
    "remember that by construction , @xmath202 and @xmath224 are disjoint .",
    "therefore , one can check that the set @xmath7 is stochastically dominated by @xmath195[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "thus to prove proposition [ p : onestep ] , we now need to bound from below the probability that @xmath7 is not empty .",
    "@xmath190 let @xmath225 be the smallest integer @xmath226 such that @xmath227 : in other words , @xmath225 is the smallest superscript of a branch that lives till generation @xmath62 . to ensure that @xmath228 , it is sufficient that @xmath229 and that @xmath230 .",
