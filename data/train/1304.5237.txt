    "the factorization picture of leading twist - perturbative qcd has played a guiding role in virtually all aspects of hadron physics phenomenology . in the case of inclusive reactions such as hadroproduction at large transverse momentum @xmath1",
    "@xcite , the parton model for perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) predicts that the cross section at leading order in the transverse momentum @xmath2 can be computed by convoluting the perturbatively calculable hard subprocess quark and gluon cross section with the process - independent structure functions of the colliding hadrons and the final - state quark or gluon fragmentation functions .",
    "the resulting leading - twist cross section @xmath3 scales as @xmath4 modulo the dglap scaling violations derived from the logarithmic evolution of the structure functions and fragmentation distributions , as well as the running of the qcd coupling appearing in the hard - scattering subprocess matrix element .",
    "the effects of final - state interactions of the scattered quark in deep inelastic scattering are characterized by a wilson line .",
    "such effects have traditionally been assumed to either give an inconsequential phase factor or power - law suppressed corrections in hard pqcd reactions .",
    "however , this expectation is only true for sufficiently inclusive cross sections .",
    "for example , consider semi - inclusive deep inelastic lepton scattering ( sidis ) on a transversely polarized target @xmath5 .",
    "( for a review see @xcite . ) in this case the final - state gluonic interactions of the scattered quark lead to a pseudo-@xmath0-odd non - zero spin correlation of the lepton - quark scattering plane with the polarization of the target proton  @xcite which is not power - law suppressed with increasing virtuality of the photon @xmath6 ; i.e. , it bjorken - scales .",
    "this asymmetry is made experimentally explicit by studying the triple product of vectors @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the momentum of the hadron fragmented from the struck quark jet .",
    "similar correlations can be found from target spin asymmetries , due to multi - photon exchanges  @xcite .",
    "a crucial fact is that the leading - twist `` sivers effect ''  @xcite is non - universal in the sense that pqcd predicts an opposite - sign correlation in drell - yan reactions relative to semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "this fundamental , but yet untested , prediction occurs because the sivers effect in the drell - yan reaction is modified by the initial - state `` lensing '' interactions of the annihilating antiquark , in contrast to the final - state lensing which produces the sivers effect in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the calculation of the sivers single - spin asymmetry in deep inelastic lepton scattering in qcd is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ sivers ] .",
    "although the coulomb phase for a given partial wave is infinite , the interference of coulomb phases arising from different partial waves leads to observable effects .",
    "the analysis requires two different orbital angular momentum components : @xmath9-wave with the quark - spin parallel to the proton spin and @xmath10-wave for the quark with anti - parallel spin ; the difference between the final - state `` coulomb '' phases leads to a @xmath11 correlation of the proton s spin with the virtual photon - to - quark production plane  @xcite .",
    "thus , as it is clear from its qed analog , the final - state gluonic interactions of the scattered quark lead to a pseudo@xmath0-odd non - zero spin correlation of the lepton - quark scattering plane with the polarization of the target proton  @xcite .",
    "the effect is pseudo - t odd due to the imaginary phase generated by the cut of the near - on - shell intermediate state .    the @xmath9- and @xmath10-wave proton wavefunctions also appear in the calculation of the pauli form factor quark - by - quark .",
    "thus one can correlate the sivers asymmetry for each struck quark with the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton carried by that quark  @xcite , leading to the prediction that the sivers effect is larger for positive pions as seen by the hermes experiment at desy  @xcite , the compass experiment  @xcite at cern , and clas at jefferson laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the final - state interactions of the produced quark with its comoving spectators in sidis also produces a final - state @xmath0-odd polarization correlation  the `` collins effect '' , in which the collins fragmentation function , instead of the sivers distribution function , generates the spin asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "this can be measured without beam polarization by measuring the correlation of the polarization of a hadron such as the @xmath12 baryon with the quark - jet production plane  @xcite .",
    "analogous spin effects occur in reactions in qed due to the rescattering via final - state coulomb interactions .        in principle , the physics of the `` lensing dynamics '' or wilson - line physics  @xcite underlying the sivers effect involves nonperturbative quark - quark interactions at small momentum transfer , not the hard scale @xmath6 of the virtuality of the photon .",
    "these considerations have thus led to a reappraisal of the range of validity of the standard factorization ansatz . as noted by collins and qiu  @xcite",
    ", the traditional factorization formalism of perturbative qcd fails in detail for many hard inclusive reactions because of initial- and final - state lensing interactions .",
    "for example , if both the quark and antiquark in the drell - yan subprocess @xmath13 interact with the spectators of the other hadron , then one predicts a @xmath14 planar correlation in unpolarized drell - yan reactions  @xcite .",
    "( here @xmath15 is the angle between the muon plane and the plane of the incident hadrons in the lepton pair center of mass frame , while @xmath16 is the angle between the momentum of one of the muons and the line of flight of partons in the same frame  @xcite . )",
    "this `` double boer - mulders effect '' @xcite can account for the anomalously large @xmath17 correlation and the corresponding violation  @xcite of the lam - tung relation @xcite for drell - yan processes observed by the na10 collaboration  @xcite , and the azimuthal angle dependence of di - jet production in unpolarized hadron scattering  @xcite .",
    "such effects again point to the importance of the corrections from initial and final - state interactions of the hard - scattering constituents , which are not included in the standard pqcd factorization formalism .",
    "the final - state interactions of the struck quark with the target spectators  @xcite also lead to diffractive events in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) at leading twist , such as @xmath18 , where the proton remains intact and isolated in rapidity ; in fact , approximately 10 % of the deep inelastic lepton - proton scattering events observed at hera are diffractive  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a rapidity gap between the target and diffractive system requires that the target remnant emerges in a color - singlet state ; this is made possible in any gauge by the soft rescattering incorporated in the wilson line or by augmented light - front wavefunctions .      as we have emphasized in the above ,",
    "the sign reversal predicted by qcd between the sivers functions @xcite in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) and in the drell - yan process ( dy ) @xcite is in contrast to the standard expectations of collinear pqcd / parton model factorization .",
    "this reversal results in different signs predicted for the single transverse spin asymmetry ( ssa ) in sidis on a transversely polarized proton versus that in the dy process involving a transversely polarized hadron .",
    "the sign difference of the sivers functions is a consequence of their being pseudo @xmath0-odd , with the sidis sivers function related to the dy sivers function by a time - reversal transformation @xcite .",
    "the essential physics of the sign change is illustrated for qed in .",
    "the final - state interaction in sidis is attractive whereas the initial - state interaction is repulsive in dy .",
    "however , the detailed analysis involves many subtle aspects due to intermediate glauber - type cuts related to unitarity .",
    "these considerations are worked out in detail in this article .    in general , the generation of a ssa requires two ingredients : ( i ) the dependence of the cross section on the transverse polarization , and ( ii ) a relative complex phase between the amplitudes corresponding to different orbital angular momenta @xcite . in the original argument given by collins @xcite the sign flip between ssa in sidis and dy arises due to a reversal of the direction of the wilson line in the definition of the sivers function under the application of @xmath0-reversal .",
    "it is interesting and important to clarify the relation between this time - reversal argument and the diagrammatic conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) stated above .",
    "while it is well - known that the propagation of a high energy quark or gluon can be approximated by a wilson line along the corresponding light cone direction , the connection between the wilson lines and feynman diagrams can be non - trivial @xcite , especially in the ssa case , where we are interested in the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude due to the condition ( ii ) above . establishing a clear connection in the feynman diagram language between the spin asymmetries in sidis and dy",
    "will greatly aid future ( model ) diagrammatic calculations for the processes .",
    "although the time - reversal symmetry argument allows one to confidently predict the sign flip between the sivers functions in the two processes , a detailed diagrammatic model calculation demonstrating the origin of this sign reversal appears to be lacking in the literature .",
    "a model calculation for the ssa in sidis was first constructed in @xcite by some of the authors ; however , an analogous calculation for dy outlined in @xcite assumed that the relative phase arises in dy due to putting the same propagators as in sidis on mass shell . as we will show below",
    ", one can think of the relative phase from the condition ( ii ) as a cut through an amplitude ( or a complex conjugate amplitude ) , in addition to the standard final - state cut one obtains when the scattering amplitude is squared . in terms of the cuts ,",
    "the calculation of @xcite assumed that the cut generating ssa in sidis was equivalent to the cut in dy . while this assumption allows one to obtain the correct answer with the sign flip in the sivers function between sidis and dy , as we shall discuss below , it is not easy to justify .",
    "in fact , the explicit calculation of the ssa in the sidis and dy processes given in this paper demonstrates that the cuts are , in fact , different , as illustrated in figures  [ dis - dy2 ] and [ dis - dy1 ] . in feynman diagram language",
    "this means that different propagators are put on the mass shell in order to extract the asymmetry in the two processes . in light - front perturbation theory ( lfpth )",
    "@xcite language this corresponds to putting different intermediate states ( that is , intermediate states involving different particles ) on the @xmath19 lf energy shell .",
    "one may then wonder how the simple sign - flip relation between the sivers functions in sidis and dy would arise from feynman diagrams with different cuts ( or lfpth diagrams with different intermediate states put on energy shell ) .",
    "while further clarification of the diagrammatic origin of the sign flip is left for future work , we shall show here by performing an explicit calculation that in the limit of high energy @xmath20 and high photon virtuality @xmath6 , the simple sign - flip relationship is preserved for sidis and dy sivers functions , despite the different cuts in the diagrams in the two cases .",
    "we thus are able to construct a diagrammatic description of the sign reversal .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : phase ] we show how the transverse polarization dependence always comes into the amplitude squared with the imaginary factor of @xmath21 . since the cross section contribution has to be real , this implies that , for the spin asymmetry to be non - zero , another factor of @xmath21 has to be generated elsewhere in the amplitude squared .",
    "we thus demonstrate the need for a phase difference between the amplitude and the complex conjugate amplitude contributing to the ssa @xcite .",
    "our analysis provides an explicit verification of the analytical properties of the complete amplitudes .    in section  [ modelfeynman ]",
    "we perform a model calculation of the spin asymmetry in the sidis and dy cases using a feynman diagram approach .",
    "we employ a model in which the proton is made out of a valence quark and a scalar color - charged diquark : this model was used previously in @xcite .",
    "instead of calculating the sivers functions directly , we consider the @xmath22 process in place of the sidis sivers function , and the @xmath23 process in place of the dy sivers function .",
    "it can be shown that the relation between these processes and the corresponding sivers functions is the same in both cases ( see @xcite for an example of how to establish the connection ) : hence , the sign reversal of the ssas in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 processes is equivalent to the sign flips in the corresponding sivers functions .    performing an explicit calculation in section  [ modelfeynman ] we demonstrate that , in the framework of the model considered , the ssas in sidis and dy arise from different cuts , as shown in figs .  [ dis - dy2 ] and [ dis - dy1 ] .",
    "nevertheless , the resulting spin asymmetries only differ by a minus sign , in agreement with the general arguments based on time - reversal anti - symmetry @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate how the same conclusion can be achieved in a lfpth calculation in section  [ modellc ] : while different lf energy denominators are put on energy shell in sidis and dy , the resulting ssa in dy is simply a negative of that in the sidis case .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our main results .",
    "the discrete symmetries of the dirac equation , @xmath24 and @xmath25 provide strong constraints on the form of the spinors and their matrix elements .",
    "in particular , the @xmath26 properties of transverse spinors bring in a unique coupling of the transverse spin dependence of a matrix element to its real and imaginary parts .",
    "this gives rise to the conclusion that the single transverse spin asymmetry requires the presence of a complex phase aside from the spinor matrix elements themselves .",
    "below , we explicitly construct the transverse spinors and the identities they satisfy corresponding to @xmath27 transformations .",
    "we demonstrate that , as a consequence , when two spinor matrix elements are multiplied together ( as in the numerator of a scattering amplitude squared ) , the part which depends on the transverse spin is pure imaginary .",
    "we then define the asymmetry observable @xmath28 and use the knowledge of the @xmath27 constraints to identify which types of diagrams can contribute to the asymmetry .",
    "we find that only interference terms can contribute to @xmath28 , and furthermore only the imaginary part of the interference term ( aside from the spinor products ) contributes .",
    "we derive an expression for the spin - difference part of the amplitude squared in terms of the imaginary part of the rest of the interference term .      in this calculation",
    "we will work with the spinors defined in ref .",
    "these spinors correspond to the spin projection along the @xmath29 axis of a particle with mass @xmath30 and are expressed in light - cone coordinates @xmath31 . for definiteness ,",
    "working in the standard ( dirac ) representation of the clifford algebra , this spinor basis is : @xmath32 \\hspace{1 cm } u_{-z}(p ) & = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2p^+ } } \\left [    \\begin{array}{c } -p^{(1 ) } + i p^{(2 ) } \\\\ p^+",

    "we can form transverse spinors as done in @xcite by taking linear combinations of ( [ spinors1 ] ) to obtain the projection along , say , the @xmath39 axis : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the spin eigenvalue along the @xmath39 axis . again , for a @xmath38 incoming particle , these spinors reflect a spin projection transverse to the beam axis ; they are simultaneous eigenstates of the dirac operator as well as the pauli - lubanski vector @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",

    "<S> we examine in detail the diagrammatic mechanisms which provide the change of sign between the single transverse spin asymmetries measured in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) and in the drell - yan process ( dy ) . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry is known to arise due to the transverse spin dependence of the target proton combined with a @xmath0-odd complex phase . using the discrete symmetry properties of transverse spinors , we show that the required complex phase originates in the denominators of rescattering diagrams and their respective cuts . for simplicity , we work in a model where the proton consists of a valence quark and a scalar diquark . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that the phases generated in sidis and in dy originate from distinctly different cuts in the amplitudes , which at first appears to obscure the relationship between the single - spin asymmetries in the two processes . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , further analysis demonstrates that the contributions of these cuts are identical in the leading - twist bjorken kinematics considered , resulting in the standard sign - flip relation between the sivers functions in sidis and dy . </S>",
    "<S> physically , this fundamental , but yet untested , prediction occurs because the sivers effect in the drell - yan reaction is modified by the initial - state `` lensing '' interactions of the annihilating antiquark , in contrast to the final - state lensing which produces the sivers effect in deep inelastic scattering .     </S>",
