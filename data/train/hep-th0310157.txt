    "the search for extensions of the gauge / gravity correspondence towards non - conformal theories with a reduced number of supercharges has recently achieved some interesting progress .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that many relevant properties of non - conformal @xmath6 and @xmath7 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions can be extracted from dual supergravity solutions associated to different set - ups of strings and d - branes .",
    "for example , at the perturbative level one can get the correct logarithmic running of the coupling constant and the chiral anomaly , while at the non - perturbative level one can discuss instantons , gaugino condensation and confining strings .",
    "many of these results can be obtained by studying in detail the supergravity solutions produced by stacks of fractional d3-branes in conifold  @xcite and orbifold  @xcite backgrounds .",
    "alternatively , non - conformal gauge theories with @xmath6 or @xmath7 supersymmetry can be realized by wrapping d - branes on suitable supersymmetric cycles in calabi  yau or k3 manifolds  @xcite .",
    "also in these cases , a detailed study of the corresponding supergravity solutions has provided relevant information on the dual gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "most of these developments are covered in recent reviews  @xcite to which we refer also for a more extended bibliography .    another line of research has been the study of the so - called `` geometric transitions ''  @xcite , where one engineers gauge theories by wrapping d5-branes on two - cycles of resolved calabi ",
    "yau manifolds in such a way that the geometry flows to a deformed manifold where branes are replaced by fluxes through the newly blown - up three - cycles . in this framework , it has been shown  @xcite how to get the non - perturbatively generated effective superpotential of the dual @xmath6 gauge theory  @xcite by means of geometric considerations .    in this paper",
    "we bring together these lines of research , and show that the explicit knowledge of the supergravity solution produced by a stack of d - branes can be fruitfully combined with general geometric considerations on the background in which they are embedded . in this way one can obtain relevant information on the dual gauge theory , both at a perturbative and at a non - perturbative level . in particular we will discuss the affleck ",
    "dine  seiberg theory , namely @xmath0 @xmath6 super qcd with @xmath8 flavors of quarks and antiquarks , which we realize as the world - volume theory of a stack of fractional d3-branes on a @xmath2 orbifold .",
    "we then show how to use this fractional brane configuration to obtain the running coupling constant , the classical moduli space of the low - energy theory and the non - perturbative effective superpotential  @xcite of sqcd in the chosen regime .",
    "we also comment on sqcd with @xmath9 which simply arises as a particular case of our construction .",

    "we introduce the @xmath2 orbifold and show how @xmath0 sqcd can be engineered via a specific configuration of fractional d3-branes . after summarizing in section  [ s : sol ] the corresponding supergravity solution , in section  [ s : moduli ] we study the dual gauge theory , deriving the running gauge coupling constant and exploring the classical moduli space . finally , in section  [ s : ads ] we show how the non - perturbatively generated affleck  dine  seiberg superpotential can be obtained by the fluxes of the dual supergravity solution together with some geometric considerations .",

    "yau three - fold , a stack of d - branes will preserve four supercharges .",
    "in particular we arrange the fractional branes according to table  [ t : conf ] , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 indicate , respectively , longitudinal and transverse directions .",

    "as is well known , the most elementary configurations of branes on orbifolds are made by fractional branes  @xcite .",
    "these are defined by the fact that the chan  paton factors of the open strings attached to them transform in the irreducible representations of the orbifold group ; moreover , they have the property of being stuck at the orbifold fixed point . in our @xmath24 orbifold , we then have four different types of fractional d3-branes , that we denote as a , b , c , d , corresponding to the four irreducible one - dimensional representations of the orbifold group .",
    "the low - energy theory living on a generic system of @xmath25 d3-branes of type @xmath26 , is a four - dimensional @xmath6 gauge theory with gauge group @xmath27 and twelve chiral multiplets , which transform in the fundamental ( or anti - fundamental ) representation of a particular gauge group factor and carry a flavor index with respect to the other three factors .",

    "a possibility to do this would be to consider a stack of @xmath33 fractional d3-branes of a given type , and add to them @xmath32 d7-branes in order to introduce the fundamental and anti - fundamental chiral multiplets  @xcite . here",
    ", however , we will follow an alternative and simpler route  @xcite , which allows to obtain the main features of @xmath6 sqcd in a very natural way by using only d3-branes .",
    "this alternative strategy amounts simply to consider a configuration of @xmath33 fractional d3-branes of , say , type a and @xmath32 fractional d3-branes of , say , type b , which gives rise to the @xmath34 gauge theory represented by the diagram of fig .",

    "the classical supergravity solution describing a system of @xmath25 fractional d3-branes of type @xmath26 placed at the origin @xmath36 of @xmath2 was constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we briefly summarize its main properties .",
    "let us first recall that the bosonic fields of type iib supergravity are the metric , the 2-form @xmath37 and the dilaton @xmath38 from the ns  ns sector , and the 0-form @xmath39 , the 2-form @xmath40 and the 4-form @xmath41 with self - dual field strength @xmath42 from the r ",
    "then , the fractional d3-brane solution is obtained by assuming that the two 2-forms @xmath37 and @xmath40 have components only along the three exceptional shrinking 2-cycles @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) of the orbifold geometry .",
    "specifically , one writes @xmath45 where the anti - self dual ( 1,1)-forms @xmath46 , dual to the 2-cycles @xmath43 , are defined and normalized as @xmath47 the scalar fields @xmath48 and @xmath49 in   are called twisted fields , and precisely correspond to massless degrees of freedom of the three ns  ns and r  r twisted sectors of the conformal field theory describing closed strings in the orbifold @xmath2 .",
    "if we define @xmath50 and @xmath51 then the solution for a stack of @xmath25 fractional d3 branes of type @xmath26 reads  @xcite @xmath52 here the functions @xmath53 are given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a short - distance regulator , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 being the string coupling constant and @xmath58 the string length ) and the @xmath59 s are functions of the numbers of the different types of fractional branes @xmath60 finally , @xmath61 is a specific function of @xmath62 whose explicit expression , which we will not need in the following , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as is clear from the solution  , each individual fractional d3-brane is charged under all three twisted sectors of the closed string theory on the orbifold @xmath2 , as well as under the untwisted one .",
    "this is perfectly consistent with the description of fractional d - branes in terms of boundary states which represent the sources for all closed string states emitted by the d - branes . in our specific case ,",
    "the boundary states for the various fractional d3-branes are schematically given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the contribution of the untwisted sector , @xmath65 is the one of the @xmath29-th twisted sector corresponding to the group element @xmath66 , and the signs are consistent with  .",
    "finally , we remark that the supergravity solution   has a naked singularity of repulson type , a common feature of all classical solutions describing fractional branes on orbifolds .",
    "one should then proceed to examine the appearance of an enhanon mechanism  @xcite that would make this geometry acceptable , but we will not perform this analysis here . instead , in the following sections we will use the above solution to study the dual @xmath6 gauge theory .",
    "let us now concentrate on the configuration made up of @xmath33 fractional d3-branes of type a and @xmath32 fractional d3-branes of type b that we introduced in section  [ s : sqcd ] and represented in fig .",
    "[ f : sqcdquiver ] .",
    "as we have seen , the theory on the world - volume of the type a branes is @xmath0 sqcd with @xmath6 supersymmetry , @xmath32 `` quark '' chiral multiplets , @xmath67 , and @xmath32 `` antiquark '' chiral multiplets , @xmath68 .",
    "many properties of this gauge theory can be explicitly obtained from the supergravity solution   ( with @xmath69 ) . as a first example , let us consider the running gauge coupling constant @xmath70 , which , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be directly related to the twisted scalars @xmath48 of the dual geometry , according to @xmath71 the right hand side of this equation can be equivalently written also in terms of the flux of @xmath72 across an appropriate singular 3-cycle of the orbifold @xmath2 . to see this , and also for our later analysis of the superpotential , it is useful to identify the singular 3-cycles that exist in this non - compact calabi  yau space .",
    "since there are no exceptional ( 1,2 ) or ( 2,1)-forms coming from the twisted sectors , everything should arise from the ( 1,1)-forms @xmath46 , dual to the singular 2-cycles @xmath43 that we already encountered in section  [ s : sol ] .",
    "thus , we can introduce three compact 3-cycles @xmath73 and three non - compact 3-cycles @xmath74 by simply taking the direct product of @xmath43 with suitable 1-cycles in the @xmath62 planes . specifically , we define @xmath75 where the compact cycles @xmath76 and the non - compact cycles @xmath77 in the @xmath62 plane are orthogonal to each other and are shown in fig .  [",
    "f : adscycles ] .     and the noncompact 1-cycle @xmath77 in the @xmath62 plane . ]    using the last equation of   and the normalizations  , one can easily see that the fluxes of @xmath72 along these 3-cycles are given by @xmath78 in particular , for our specific brane configuration , we find @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the last line , the integrations over @xmath81 in the non - compact cycles @xmath77 extend up to a cut - off @xmath82 , which sets the higher scale , while the lower scale @xmath83 is introduced as a further short - distance cut - off , since the validity of the singular supergravity solution stops at a finite distance from the brane position .",
    "if we identify @xmath83 with the ( arbitrary ) cut - off @xmath55 appearing in  , we immediately see that @xmath84 , and thus   becomes @xmath85 introducing the renormalization scale @xmath86 and the dynamically generated scale @xmath87 through the usual energy / radius relations @xmath88 that follow from a `` stretched string '' analysis  @xcite , we easily get from   the correct one - loop running coupling constant for our @xmath0 sqcd theory .",
    "we now turn to the vacuum structure of this theory and show how it can be recovered from the supergravity solution   of fractional d3-branes in a very simple way . since it is known that @xmath0 sqcd has a very different behavior depending on the number of flavors ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) , here we concentrate on the case in which the number of flavors @xmath32 is less than the number of colors @xmath33 .",
    "this is the so - called affleck ",
    "dine  seiberg ( ads ) theory  @xcite , in which an effective superpotential is generated by non - perturbative effects .    to see how the vacuum structure of the ads theory can be recovered from supergravity ,",
    "let us begin by considering a single fractional d3-brane of type a together with one of type b. as individual objects , these branes are charged under all four sectors of closed string theory , and for this reason they can not move off the orbifold fixed point ( see the corresponding boundary states  ) .",
    "however , since a and b are mutually bps objects , we can easily construct the superposition a@xmath89b , which will be charged under the sector twisted by @xmath19 ( with a charge double with respect to a single fractional brane ) , but will not carry any charge under the other two twisted sectors .",
    "this can be easily seen in the boundary state description , where one writes @xmath90 thus , the superposition a@xmath91b can freely move in the @xmath92 plane , which is left fixed by the action of @xmath19 .",
    "notice that when the pair a@xmath91b is not at the origin , it can not be divided anymore into its components , which indeed are defined only at the orbifold fixed point .",
    "the crucial observation is that the motion of a@xmath91b causes the breaking of the @xmath93 gauge group of the theory living on the superposition down to @xmath94 via the higgs mechanism .",
    "returning to our sqcd configuration and repeating the above argument , one finds that out of the @xmath33 branes of type a and the @xmath32 branes of type b , it is possible to build @xmath32 a@xmath89b superpositions and move them away from the origin at arbitrary points in the @xmath92 plane .",
    "the motion of these a@xmath89b pairs is naturally interpreted as giving arbitrary vacuum expectation values to the meson matrix @xmath95 , thus breaking the gauge group @xmath0 down to @xmath96 corresponding to the world - volume theory of remaining @xmath97 fractional branes of type a still placed at the origin .",
    "therefore , this d - brane construction uncovers the correct classical moduli space of the ads theory in a very natural way , as shown in fig .",

    "let us now discuss how the supergravity solution   gets modified when we form the a@xmath89b superpositions and move them in the @xmath92 plane . for simplicity , but without any loss of generality , we place all @xmath32 superpositions at the same point @xmath101 on the real axis of the @xmath92 plane , as shown in fig .

    ", the flux of @xmath72 along the @xmath74 cycles is given by  , in agreement with the fact that in this case all degrees of freedom are light and thus contribute to the running of the coupling constant as in  .",
    "]    thus , the gauge coupling constant for the world - volume theory of the unpaired a branes is @xmath112 which in terms of the gauge theory scales becomes @xmath113 with @xmath114 .",

    "this concludes our analysis of the theory at the classical and perturbative levels . in the next section",
    ", we will turn to non - perturbative phenomena , with the computation of the effective superpotential .",
    "we now study the quantum moduli space of sqcd using our d - brane set - up , and see that our quantitative results perfectly agree with the field theory analysis , predicting that the classical moduli space is lifted by the generation of the ads superpotential  @xcite .",

    "in fact , in the conifold case the knowledge of the singular klebanov  tseytlin solution is sufficient for computing the @xmath72 fluxes that are needed in , for the very simple reason that they are precisely identified with the fluxes of the regular klebanov  strassler solution . appearing in the singular kt solution , and the coordinate @xmath121 appearing in the regular ks solution",

    "the same is true also in our case , and thus even if we do not know a regular solution in a deformed orbifold , the @xmath72 fluxes can be obtained from the singular solution as described in section  [ s : moduli ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the periods of @xmath119 that enter in can not be determined in the singular case , since they crucially depend on the details of the deformation of the geometry .",
