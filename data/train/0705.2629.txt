    "in this work we describe recent progress in lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) computations in a model dual to pure yang - mills theory .",
    "the dual model we consider is based upon the character expansion of the amplitude at each fundamental plaquette , a procedure that has been known since the early days of lattice gauge theory  @xcite . to date",
    ", the most common use of this duality transformation has been in the strong - coupling expansion , as described for example in  @xcite and references therein .",
    "because of this historical association with strong - coupling approximations , we should emphasize here that it is the exact dual model that we compute with , sampling from the full space of dual configurations to find the expectation values of observables .",
    "the first steps towards such dual computations in the non - abelian case were taken by hari dass et al .  in  @xcite",
    "; more recently , interest in dual computations of lattice yang - mills theory has grown within the spin foam community  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most significant change in passing to the dual model is that the variables include discrete labels assigned to lattice plaquettes .",
    "this aspect alone gives a very different character to the computation when compared to the conventional formulation of lgt , where continuous group - valued variables are assigned to lattice edges .",
    "another significant difference is the fact that the discrete labels must satisfy certain constraints , making the choice of metropolis moves non - trivial ( see section  [ se : review ] ) .",
    "the allowed configurations can be viewed as closed , branched surfaces colored by the irreducible representations of the gauge group . to illustrate ,",
    "some renderings of non - zero dual configurations are shown in figure  [ fig : visuals ] .    as general motivation for the dual approach",
    ", we observe that the dual configurations have a gauge - independent meaning rooted in the statistical geometry of the two - dimensional branched surfaces , providing a compelling geometric picture for the evolution of the physical degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , in the strong - coupling limit , the dual picture provides a straightforward analytic proof of confinement ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) . by making topological excitations manifest ,",
    "a dual model is well suited to evaluating proposed mechanisms of quark confinement , such as the dual superconductor picture .",
    "this advantage has already been demonstrated in the abelian @xmath0 case  @xcite and has also been remarked upon in the non - abelian case  @xcite .",
    "recently , effective theories have been derived directly from the dual theory  @xcite , and so we believe a computational framework for numerical computations within the dual theory is timely .",
    "while results have been reported with dual models in the @xmath0 theory , the non - abelian case has presented a greater computational challenge . as a testing ground for dual non - abelian simulation algorithms , we focus in the present work on @xmath1 pure yang - mills in three space - time dimensions .",
    "the observable we study is the average spin ( see section  3 ) which is convenient for testing as it takes a simple form on both sides of the duality . in describing our algorithm and results ,",
    "we address potential problems for non - abelian dual computations that were discussed in the work of hari dass et al .",
    "@xcite , the most critical of which were the construction of ergodic moves and a sign problem .",
    "the results obtained with our metropolis algorithm appear to overcome these difficulties for the range of lattice sizes and coupling constants presented here . with the current algorithm ,",
    "a difficulty ( discussed in section  4.2 ) emerges at weak coupling , however our expectation is that it will be resolved with a more refined form of the algorithm .",
    "although there is an intriguing possibility that dual algorithms may eventually outperform their conventional equivalents in certain contexts , the present work focuses on the general features of computing with dual algorithms and verifying their correctness against a conventional lattice code . in future work , we will address more optimized implementations of the algorithms described here , with the ultimate goal of providing results in four dimensions with lattice sizes typical of contemporary lattice qcd .",
    "an important next step will be to extend our methods to wilson loop observables crucial to the study of quark confinement and glueball spectra ; this work is currently in progress  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we define the dual model under study and describe a metropolis algorithm for numerical computations .",
    "in section 3 , we describe computations on a @xmath4 lattice that allow us to verify threefold agreement ( within statistical error ) between dual metropolis , conventional metropolis and the exact partition function . in section 4",
    ", we describe our computations for lattice sizes of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 and report agreement between dual and conventional metropolis results , again within statistical error .",
    "section 5 provides a brief outlook on generalizing the algorithm and section 6 presents our conclusions .",
    "some details relevant for performing the computations are given in the appendix , which also shows how the dual amplitude formula used by hari dass  @xcite , originally given in  @xcite and discussed in  @xcite , fits into the spin foam formalism used to develop our algorithm .",
    "opposite sides of the lattice are identified . in the right - hand figure a sheet of flux spanning",

    "in this section we define the dual model for @xmath1 pure yang - mills on a hyper - cubic lattice and describe a metropolis algorithm for performing dual computations .",
    "of particular relevance to our present work is the application of diagrammatic methods and spin foam formalism , as described for example in  @xcite , a critical feature being the expression of group integrals of representation matrices and their contractions as sums over intertwiners . while the spin foam formalism for dual models is a more recent development , the construction of exact dual non - abelian models has a longer history  @xcite .",
    "traditional derivations of the duality transformation and their use in strong - coupling expansions can be found in the texts @xcite .",
    "first we recall the euclidean partition function of pure yang - mills theory in @xmath8 dimensions , with gauge group @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ( we shall later specialize to the @xmath1 case ) .",
    "it takes the form @xmath11 with @xmath12 the gauge field , @xmath13 the action functional , and @xmath14 the functional integration measure . in the continuum version of the theory",
    "the standard action functional is @xmath15 = \\frac{1}{4g^2 } \\int d^dx\\ , f^a_{\\mu\\nu } f_a^{\\mu\\nu},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the field strength tensor and @xmath17 the continuum coupling .",
    "unfortunately , the continuum functional measure @xmath14 is not well - defined .    one way to give the above path integral rigorous meaning and , at the same time ,",
    "make it amenable to computational treatment , is to put the theory on a discrete finite lattice .",
    "the simplest variant uses a hyper - cubic lattice .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote respectively the sets of edges and plaquettes of a hyper - cubic lattice in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "the gauge field @xmath20 is replaced by gauge group elements @xmath21 assigned to each oriented lattice edge @xmath22 . the same edge with opposite orientation",
    "gets @xmath23 instead of @xmath21 .",
    "the functional integral measure can now be replaced by an integral over the product of @xmath24 copies of @xmath25 using haar measure : @xmath26 at the same time , the action functional is replaced by a discretized version , @xmath27 $ ] , that must reproduce the continuum action @xmath28 $ ] as the lattice spacing is taken to zero .",
    "the discretized action is usually split into a sum over plaquettes , @xmath29 = \\sum_{p\\in p } s(g_p)$ ] , where the group element @xmath30 is the holonomy around an oriented plaquette @xmath31 .",
    "that is , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is either the group element assigned to the @xmath34th edge of @xmath31 or its inverse if the orientations of @xmath31 and the @xmath34th edge are opposing .",
    "this yields the conventional lattice partition function @xmath35    there are many candidate discretized plaquette actions @xmath36 .",
    "while the wilson action  @xcite is perhaps the most well - known in conventional lgt ( it was also used in the dual computations of  @xcite ) , a variety of actions @xmath37 leading to the correct continuum limit are known and have been used in the literature  @xcite . in the present work , we use the _ heat kernel action _  @xcite ; in the dual model this action leads to plaquette factors that are particularly easy to compute .",
    "the heat kernel action ( at lattice coupling @xmath38 ) for a fundamental plaquette @xmath31 and plaquette holonomy @xmath39 is @xmath40 where the heat kernel @xmath41 , which is a function of a group element @xmath17 and of a `` time '' parameter @xmath42 , satisfies a diffusion type differential equation @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath25 and @xmath45 is the delta function at the group identity @xmath46 .",
    "the denominator in ( [ eq : heatkernel ] ) represents a normalization of the partition function in which flat holonomies ( @xmath47 ) are assigned an amplitude of unity .",
    "we shall follow the common practice of discussing the phase structure of a lattice theory using the @xmath48 parameter @xmath49 .",
    "we now turn to the definition of the dual model for the specific case of @xmath50 pure yang - mills in three dimensions . starting from the conventional formulation of the lattice partition function @xmath51 given in  ( [ eq : conventional ] ) above , the duality transformation can be applied ( see appendix  [ sse : derivation ] ) to yield the following expression for @xmath51 in terms of the dual variables : @xmath52 here @xmath53 denotes the vertex set of the lattice , while the summations over @xmath34 and @xmath54 range over all possible edge and plaquette labellings , respectively .",
    "a plaquette labelling @xmath54 assigns an irreducible representation of @xmath1 to each element of @xmath19 .",
    "these representations are labelled by non - negative half - integers ( we will denote this set by @xmath55 ) and are referred to as _ spins _ ; a labelling @xmath54 is thus a map @xmath56 .",
    "an edge labelling @xmath34 , on the other hand , is valued in a basis of maps that intertwine the representations of the plaquettes incident on the same edge . in our present case , the choice of basis corresponds to a grouping of the four incident plaquette spins into two pairs .",
    "when such an edge splitting has been made , the intertwiners may also be labelled by spins , as described just before definition  [ defn : admissible - spin - foam ] and in appendix  [ sse : algs ] .",
    "different choices of splitting can be made , but , some are more computationally efficient than others . in writing  ( [ eq : statesum ] ) , we assume a fixed choice of splitting has been made and so an edge labelling is a map @xmath57 .    in the first pair of parentheses of  ( [ eq : statesum ] ) , there is a product of @xmath58 _ symbols _ , each of which is a function of the 18 spins which label the @xmath59 plaquettes and @xmath60 edges incident to a vertex @xmath61 ; we denote the spins which appear by @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "next to it is a product of edge normalizations @xmath64 depending on the edge spin @xmath65 and on the four spins @xmath66 labelling the plaquettes incident on @xmath67 .",
    "it is important to recognize that the @xmath58 symbol and the normalization factors @xmath64 are purely representation - theoretic quantities ( independent of the action chosen ) and that , from a computational viewpoint , they represent the non - trivial part of the amplitude evaluation .",
    "efficient algorithms can be found ( using diagrammatic techniques similar to those used in  @xcite ) for computing the @xmath58 symbols and edge normalizations .",
    "two of these are reviewed in appendix  [ sse : algs ] .    in the second parentheses of  ( [ eq : statesum ] )",
    "there is a product of factors depending on @xmath68 only ; these arise from the character expansion coefficients of the heat kernel action  ( [ eq : heatkernel ] ) and are clearly straightforward to compute .    for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we define a _",
    "spin foam _ to be an assignment of spins and intertwiners to the plaquettes and edges of the lattice , respectively .",
    "we define _ supported spin foams _ to be those with non - vanishing amplitude , and denote the set of them by @xmath69 . in terms of the supported spin foams we can write  ( [ eq : statesum ] ) as : @xmath70 it turns out that the spin foams that actually make a non - zero contribution to @xmath51 are highly constrained , a fact that is not manifest in  ( [ eq : statesum ] ) where every possible edge and plaquette coloring contributes a term .",
    "moreover , once the plaquette spins have been specified , there is a limited range of intertwiner spins that give a non - zero amplitude .",
    "the details of these constraints will be discussed in section 2.2 .",
    "the essential challenge for performing metropolis simulations with this model is to find a set of moves that connect all the supported spin foams @xmath71 .",
    "to see why this is a non - trivial task , observe that if one has any supported spin foam and adds or removes a half - unit of spin from a single plaquette , the result will be a spin foam with vanishing amplitude ; this follows immediately from the parity condition ( see definition 2.1 below ) , enforced by the @xmath58 symbol .",
    "changing single plaquettes by two half - units of spin preserves parity but restricts one to a single parity class .",
    "thus a move involving a single plaquette is `` too local '' and so moves involving multiple plaquettes and edges simultaneously are needed .",
    "we now turn to this problem .",
    "we first define the set of _ admissible plaquette configurations .",
    "_ these configurations are precisely those plaquette labellings that satisfy _ edge admissibility _ at every edge of the lattice :    the spins assigned to plaquettes incident to an edge are said to be _ edge admissible _ if the _ parity _ and _ triangle inequality _ conditions are satisfied . writing @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the four spins incident to a given edge , these conditions are :    1 .   * parity * : @xmath76",
    "* triangle inequality * : for each permutation @xmath77 of @xmath78 we have @xmath79    these conditions are equivalent to the existence of a non - zero invariant vector in the @xmath1 representation @xmath80 .",
    "if a splitting has been made for the edge , say with @xmath72 and @xmath73 on one side and @xmath74 and @xmath75 on the other , then the triangle inequality can be written in the less symmetric form @xmath81 representation - theoretically , the less symmetric form says that there exists a non - trivial intertwiner between @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "a basis of such intertwiners is labelled by spins which match parity with @xmath84 and @xmath85 and fall into the specific range defined below .",
    "this leads us to the following definition of an _ admissible spin foam _ :    [ defn : admissible - spin - foam ] a spin foam is _ admissible _ if and only if :    1 .",
    "the assignment of spins to plaquettes is everywhere edge admissible .",
    "2 .   for every edge @xmath22",
    ", @xmath86 satisfies @xmath87 and @xmath88\\cap[\\left|j_{3}-j_{4}\\right|,j_{3}+j_{4}],\\ ] ] where @xmath89\\equiv\\left\\ { j\\in\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{n}\\mid a\\leq j\\leq b\\right\\ } $ ] .",
    "we call the interval @xmath90 the _ range _ of the triangle inequalities at edge @xmath67 .",
    "it is guaranteed to be non - empty by edge admissibility .",
    "we denote the set of admissible spin foams by @xmath91 .    at this point",
    "we observe that while any supported spin foam is admissible , the converse does not necessarily hold , as the amplitude can vanish despite admissibility conditions being satisfied .",
    "we define _ exceptional spin foams _ to be admissible spin foams of vanishing amplitude and denote them by @xmath92 in practice , exceptional spin foams are rarely encountered during simulation .",
    "if one assumes that exceptional spin foams are sufficiently isolated ( i.e.  do not form surfaces that separate the configuration space ) then the question of ergodicity will not be affected , i.e.  it will be sufficient to show ergodicity of moves on admissible spin foams . in what follows",
    ", we shall make this assumption and refer to it as the _ isolation of exceptionals _ hypothesis .    before considering ergodicity with respect to spin foams",
    ", it is useful to first describe moves by which any admissible _ plaquette _ configuration can be reached from any other admissible plaquette configuration :    a _ plaquette cube move _ consists of    1 .   a choice of 3-cell of the cubic lattice .",
    "these are simply the smallest cubes of the lattice , with 6 plaquettes , 12 edges , and 8 vertices .",
    "2 .   for each of the 6 plaquettes of the 3-cell",
    ", a change is made to that spin by @xmath93 or @xmath94 units of spin .",
    "it can be shown that these moves are ergodic on the space of admissible plaquette configurations ( ignoring for the moment non - trivial global topology of the lattice ) ; a similar argument is used for instance in  @xcite .",
    "we next observe that , within our present context where the amplitude depends on intertwiner labellings , the plaquette cube moves will transform between _",
    "admissible _ plaquette configurations but _ inadmissible _ spin foams , unless some simultaneous changes are made to the intertwiners labelling the edges of the cube .",
    "this leads us to define _ spin foam _ cube moves as follows :    a _ spin foam cube move _ consists of the following :    1 .",
    "a plaquette cube move .",
    "2 .   for each edge in the 3-cell chosen for the plaquette cube move",
    ", a randomly chosen change is made to the intertwiner labelling that edge , from a fixed set of possible changes .",
    "the possible changes are such that for any plaquette cube move , there is always a change that results in an admissible spin foam .",
    "the intertwiner changes that are proposed depend on how the edges are split within the selected cube ; further details can be found in appendix  [ sse : compatible ] .",
    "we should mention here that for all the spin foam moves discussed in this section there will be many moves that are rejected immediately due to violation of the constraints ; these are nonetheless counted as moves in order to satisfy detailed balance .    by construction",
    ", spin foam cube moves will reach some subset of intertwiner labellings for each plaquette configuration .",
    "the possibility that this may omit some admissible intertwiner configurations leads us to introduce an independent edge move .    a _ spin foam edge move _ consists of the following :    1 .   an edge is selected",
    "the intertwiner label is incremented or decremented by two half - units of spin ( to preserve parity ) .    to see that the combination of spin foam cube and edge moves are ergodic on admissible spin foams ( up to non - trivial global homology ) , we argue as follows .",
    "observe that the spin foam cube moves allow us to move freely amongst the admissible plaquette configurations . to reach any given spin foam , one first obtains the associated plaquette configuration through the spin foam cube moves .",
    "we then apply whatever spin foam edge moves are needed to set the edge labels to their given values .",
    "this is possible because the admissible ranges @xmath95 are connected by spin foam edge moves .",
    "we now turn to the the issue of configurations arising from the non - trivial global topology of the lattice .",
    "it is common in lattice computations to impose periodic boundary conditions which are toroidal ; i.e.  in the present case the lattice is a discretization of the @xmath96-torus .",
    "for these boundary conditions , if one introduces a sheet of half - unit spin having non - trivial global topology ( see figure  [ fig : visuals ] , right ) , the spin foam cube moves are not able to remove it .",
    "such a sheet ( and its deformations by cube moves ) can be introduced in any of the three directions of the 3-torus , in correspondence with the three generators of the second homology group of the 3-torus .",
    "a simple way to move between configurations corresponding to different homology classes is to create and remove sheets of half - unit spin ; we do this by introducing the following moves :    a _ spin foam homology move _",
    "consists of the following :    1 .",
    "a 2-dimensional plane of plaquettes spanning the lattice is selected .",
    "applying periodic boundary conditions , this plane topologically defines a 2-torus wrapped around the 3-torus .",
    "2 .   for the selected plane , change each edge and plaquette label contained in it by the same amount , either @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "we note that the cost of computing the change in amplitude induced by these moves scales with @xmath97 ( where @xmath98 is the side length of the lattice ) , making them costly for large lattices ; we shall return to this point in our discussion below .",
    "now we have all the components to give a simple statement of our algorithm .",
    "( ergodic spin foam algorithm ) _ a single iteration of the algorithm consists of the following : _    1 .",
    "apply a single spin foam cube move , spin foam edge move , or spin foam homology move .",
    "2 .   for the edges affected by the move , immediately reject the move if any spin foam admissibility condition is violated .",
    "3 .   accept the move if @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 denote the spin foam amplitudes before and after the move , and @xmath102@xmath103 is a sample drawn from from the uniform distribution on the unit interval .",
    "step 1 gives a choice from among a set of moves that are ergodic on admissible spin foams , not just within a homology class but between classes as well .",
    "for each type of move , detailed balance is guaranteed as any move and its inverse is proposed with equal probability .",
    "the relative probability of proposing a cube , edge , or homology move can be freely chosen , for example to tune the algorithm for better convergence or acceptance rate .",
    "step 2 could in principle be absorbed into step 3 , as the zeroes of the @xmath58 symbols enforce all the admissibility constraints . in practice",
    ", admissibility is very easy to check and so one can often avoid computing the full @xmath58 symbol .",
    "step 3 is just the usual metropolis acceptance condition ; observables depending on the dual variables can be measured at each iteration or at regular intervals .",
    "the absolute value of the amplitudes in step 3 are necessary due to the possibility of negative amplitudes ( arising from the @xmath58 symbols ) .",
    "the standard sign trick for computing expectation values in this situation is reviewed in section  [ ssse : sign - problem ] .    in summary , we have defined a dual metropolis algorithm for non - abelian @xmath1 pure yang - mills in the case of three dimensions . assuming the isolation of exceptionals hypothesis , this algorithm is ergodic on supported spin foams . before presenting results for our algorithm in sections 3 and 4 , we review some practical points of implementation .",
    "when using the above algorithm , there are a number of novel considerations that do nt apply to the conventional case .",
    "we discuss some of the more important ones here .",
    "it is possible to define an alternative dual algorithm based upon plaquette configurations ( rather than spin foams , which include intertwiner labels ) , using the plaquette cube moves to move ergodically between all admissible plaquette configurations . by applying the intertwiner expansion and fast evaluation of the @xmath58 symbols",
    ", one can automate the computation of plaquette configuration amplitudes .",
    "this would proceed by writing the partition function ( [ eq : statesum ] ) in terms of an intertwiner independent amplitude : @xmath104 where the amplitude @xmath105 is a function of plaquette labelling @xmath54 only ; i.e.  the full sum over intertwiner labels has been absorbed into the amplitude for a given plaquette labelling .",
    "the question then becomes whether this algorithm is practical .",
    "we found that the answer depends crucially on the strength of the coupling .",
    "for comparison , we implemented the plaquette configuration simulation and were able to achieve good agreement with conventional results at _ sufficiently strong coupling _",
    "( @xmath106 ) , where configurations involving large intertwiner sums are penalized by the amplitude .",
    "however , starting at @xmath103@xmath107 the simulation began to spend time in plaquette configurations with a large space of admissible intertwiner labellings ; because the summations are nested there are a huge number of edge labelled terms being evaluated for a single plaquette configuration .",
    "compounding this situation is a second critical drawback , in that for many configurations ( and increasingly so at weaker coupling ) the terms in the intertwiner summations couple edges that are arbitrarily distant in the lattice .",
    "thus , at large lattice sizes and weak coupling the cost of computing the change in amplitude due to a single move will on average be of the order of the lattice volume .",
    "the spin foam algorithm defined in section 2.2 avoids both problems by making local changes to both plaquettes and edge labels . in summary , rather than importance sampling the plaquette configurations with a generally expensive , non - local amplitude ( the intertwiner sum ) ,",
    "one applies importance sampling to the innermost terms of  ( [ eq : statesum ] ) , which carry both plaquette and edge labels .",
    "while this involves a larger space of configurations , the evaluation of amplitudes proceeds extremely rapidly and independent of coupling .",
    "the observation that such a local algorithm exists for dual yang - mills theories ( and also for dimensions higher than 3 ) was made by halliday and suranyi in  @xcite , although they do not make explicit use of the spin foam formalism .      because the @xmath58 symbol can take on negative values , the most straightforward form of the metropolis algorithm is not applicable .",
    "nonetheless , one can try to avoid this problem by applying what is commonly referred to as the `` sign trick '' , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we note that the sign trick was also employed in the work of hari dass  @xcite . letting @xmath108 denote the sign of the amplitude @xmath109 for spin foam @xmath110",
    ", one can express the expectation value of an observable @xmath111 as follows : @xmath112 observe that we now have a ratio of two expectation values , which can be estimated using simulations of a system governed by the _ absolute value _",
    "@xmath103@xmath113 of the original amplitude ( we indicate this by adding a subscript @xmath114 ) .",
    "a common failing of this approach is that for many systems studied in quantum monte carlo ( where the sign problem arises frequently ) , both numerator and denominator of the expression decay exponentially with a parameter under study . in such cases",
    "there are more sophisticated approaches available ; invariably , resolving a serious sign problem requires exploiting foreknowledge of the distribution of positive and negative weights in the configuration space .",
    "as discussed in section 4 , for the range of @xmath115 and lattice sizes up to the maximum studied ( @xmath116 , the numerator and denominator of  ( [ eq : signtrick ] ) are of order unity . in this regime , the sign problem is very tame and does not prevent accurate results from being obtained .      due to the extended nature of the structures added and removed by the homology moves ( involving on the order of @xmath97 vertices and plaquettes ) ,",
    "the associated change in amplitude becomes increasingly expensive to calculate for larger lattices .",
    "the situation for the present case of @xmath1 yang - mills in three dimensions can be summarized as follows .",
    "homology changing moves are necessary to achieve agreement with conventional code on very small lattices , such as the @xmath4 lattice discussed in section  [ se : verification ] .",
    "however , we have found in practice that as the lattice size increases , the frequency with which homology moves are attempted can be greatly decreased and ultimately set to zero without affecting the result .",
    "this is because adding a sheet of half - unit spin has a very low acceptance rate for larger lattices .",
    "we should mention however that for different spin foam models , particularly those which are in a deconfining phase , the non - trivial homology sectors of the ensemble will likely make significant contributions for arbitrarily large lattice sizes , and so can not be neglected .",
    "before proceeding to simulations at larger lattice size , an implementation of the dual algorithm described in section 2 was verified on a @xmath4 lattice . for this lattice and all lattices discussed in the paper ,",
    "toroidal boundary conditions were applied .",
    "the observable measured was @xmath117 , the average spin per plaquette .",
    "the expectation value for this observable is : @xmath118 from the translation invariance of our lattice , this is a good estimator for the expectation value of spin on a single plaquette .    while too small to be of physical interest , the @xmath4 lattice size makes it easy to check agreement between different monte carlo algorithms , as convergence is fast on smaller lattices .",
    "moreover , by applying a spin cutoff it is possible to _ exactly _ compute the ( cut - off ) partition function of the dual model on a @xmath4 lattice .",
    "this is done for cutoffs @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which correspond to the restrictions that @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively . while @xmath120 gives on the order of @xmath123 configurations on the @xmath4 lattice , the case of @xmath124 already requires on",
    "the order of @xmath125 configurations and is not practical . in figure",
    "[ fig : exactcheck ] ,     lattice for @xmath120 . ]     lattice for @xmath120 . ]",
    "we show the results for spin cutoff @xmath120 . for the conventional computations ,",
    "the cut - off is realized by truncating the character expansion of the heat kernel ; e.g.  for @xmath120 only the first three terms of the character expansion are used .",
    "this truncation leads to a mild sign problem for the conventional calculation that can be resolved using the sign trick for the range of @xmath48 presented here .",
    "the main plots in figure  [ fig : exactcheck ] each show two curves which appear on top of each other .",
    "the inset plots show the relative errors @xmath126 where the subscripts @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath67 refer to the conventional , dual and exact calculations .",
    "the expectation values @xmath129 and @xmath130 and their standard deviations were found from the results of 12 runs of @xmath131 simulation steps each .",

    "the metropolis simulation eventually becomes `` trapped '' in a region of higher spin than untrapped configuations .",
    "these trapped regions appear to have steep or narrow exits , as the simulation remains trapped for the duration of the computation .",
    "this behavior is also observed in some runs at stronger coupling ( small @xmath48 ) ; the trapped mode generally takes a longer time to develop as coupling is increased , and is absent entirely from most of the runs at the strongest couplings considered .",
    "while the precise nature of this slow - down is not yet fully understood , it shows some of the symptoms of similar problems noted for dual @xmath0 in three dimensions . in  @xcite , long autocorrelation times ( not seen with the conventional code at the same @xmath48 ) are observed past a certain @xmath48 .",
    "slow - down of dual algorithms due to overly local moves at weak coupling is also alluded to in  @xcite for @xmath0 in four dimensions .    by analogy with the existing literature on the dual @xmath0 case , it is possible that the solution will involve adding moves that simultaneously change spins over regions that are larger than the minimal cube .",
    "a useful analog to consider may be spin systems , where the variables are also discrete and slow - down has been successfully addressed using cluster algorithms  @xcite . in our case , the presence of admissibility and parity constraints tends to make it difficult to find moves with reasonable acceptance rates .",

    "the algorithm has direct generalizations to @xmath145 and even @xmath146 .",
    "vertex amplitudes ( generalizations of the @xmath58 symbol ) will likely be more intricate , as for higher @xmath143 more than one discrete variable is needed to label a given irreducible representation .",
    "the basic structure of the algorithm in terms of moves on plaquette and intertwiner labels should go through , although admissibility constraints can be expected to take a more complicated form .",
    "an interesting feature of the dual model is the ease with which @xmath144-deformed gauge groups @xmath147 can be treated once the infrastructure for computing with @xmath146 is in place .",

    "currently , the algorithm we describe has provided results on a @xmath7 lattice for @xmath48 up to 2.85 , and work is underway to extend this to larger lattices and weaker coupling ( higher @xmath48 ) .",
    "we expect addressing higher @xmath48 will involve introducing moves that change spin foams over a larger region of the lattice , as our algorithm appears to exhibit the symptoms of crossover to a delocalized , disordered phase as observed in  @xcite for the case of dual three - dimensional @xmath0 . in four dimensions ,",
    "the expectation is that similar behavior will be seen as the critical point is approached .",
    "the fact that cluster algorithms have been remarkably successful at addressing critical slow - down in discrete spin systems is promising in this regard and it is likely that some insights from this area may apply .",
    "the ultimate impact of the sign problem is still not fully understood from the present work , as the sign expectation begins decreasing away from unity at close to the same @xmath48 where the current simulation is obstructed by impractically long autocorrelation times .",
    "assuming a practical resolution to the trapping problem can be found , it will be interesting to see whether or not the sign problem becomes a serious obstacle at weaker coupling .",
    "an important property of our algorithm is the use of both plaquette labels and edge ( intertwiner ) labels as variables of the simulation .",
    "this allows the metropolis algorithm to proceed through local moves whose changes in amplitude can be evaluated very rapidly . using the spin foam formalism , ergodicity is fairly straightforward to show ; it is essentially an extension of an algorithm used in previous ( quantum gravity ) spin foam computations  @xcite to the case where intertwiner labels are changed as well .",
    "our claim of ergodicity does however depend on the unproven hypothesis that exceptional zeros of the @xmath58 symbol are isolated , i.e.  the zeros do not form surfaces that separate the space of admissible spin foams .",
    "the agreement of our results with conventional computations can be viewed as evidence for this hypothesis .",
    "another interesting aspect of our algorithm is the necessity ( for full ergodicity ) of introducing moves that change homology class , in the case where boundary conditions lead to non - trivial global topology of the lattice .",
    "while for the specific model studied here such configurations have negligible weight for large lattices , in more general spin foam models ( e.g.  those in a deconfining phase ) these configurations may play a more important role .",
    "also worth emphasizing is the important role of diagrammatic techniques in generating efficient algorithms for the @xmath58 symbols . in particular , the formula of anishetty et al .",
    "@xcite used in  @xcite can be derived very economically from a particular splitting of the @xmath58 symbol , as we show in the appendix .",
    "while still in its very early stages ( particularly in comparison with several decades development of conventional lgt codes ) , we believe dual computations have a promising future ahead .",
    "the algorithm we describe here immediately generalizes to higher @xmath143 gauge groups and to four dimensions , and work is underway to incorporate dynamic fermions into the dual framework .",
    "the next major step is the computation of wilson loop observables , currently in progress  @xcite . finally , the application of the technique to spin - foam quantum gravity coupled to matter provides a long - term motivation for the present work .",

    "first , spin networks do not require that the edges be directed , which relieves us of some complicated bookkeeping .",
    "second , by using spin networks , we can take advantage of many existing formulas and software libraries for computing spin network evaluations .",
    "recall that a spin network is a trivalent undirected ribbon graph whose edges are labelled by spins .",
    "one assigns a value to a spin network in the following way .",
    "first , draw it in the plane , in general position , with the ribbon flat .",
    "then , read it from top to bottom , interpreting the vertices as the trivalent intertwiners discussed above , and interpreting cups and caps as certain intertwiners which can introduce signs .",
    "if the spin network is closed , the resulting intertwiner is a map from the trivial representation to itself , and so can be identified with a complex number . the result is independent of the embedding in the plane , a fact that is quite useful in computations . in particular ,",
    "the trivalent intertwiners are chosen carefully so that the evaluation remains unchanged when inputs are deformed into outputs and vice versa .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for more details . while the starting point is different , the formulas given in  @xcite , with @xmath197 , also apply to these diagrams .",
    "note that some other authors have slightly different conventions , e.g.  some take @xmath198 .",
    "we will now work out how to compute tensor contractions using spin networks .",
    "take a tensor contraction diagram involving just the trivalent intertwiners discussed above and draw it in the plane such that all edges are pointing downwards except for some edges which leave the bottom of the diagram and loop around to reenter at the top .",
    "if we erase the arrows , the resulting spin network will have the same interpretation as the tensor contraction diagram , except for the signs introduced in the cups and caps .",
    "one can show that the difference is exactly a factor of @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is the sum of the spins labelling the edges that loop around .    as a first example",

    "each plaquette spin shows up in exactly one such sign factor , so the signs combine to give @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is the sum of all plaquette spins . note that on a lattice with two or more odd side - lengths , this sign factor can be non - trivial .",
    "next we must work out the value of the @xmath58 symbols that arise using the vertical splitting .",
    "the corresponding spin network is obtained by applying this splitting to the vertices of the octahedron shown in   and erasing the arrows from its edges . a method for evaluating this spin network",

    "* chapter 9 ) and is closely related to the wigner - racah @xmath214 symbol of angular momentum theory  ( * ? ? ?",

    "the bubbles are proportional to the identity , weighted by a theta network divided by a loop .",
    "six theta networks arising from the bubbles cancel against six of the twelve theta networks from the recoupling moves to give the six theta networks shown in the final line .",
    "the bubbles also contribute six loop factors ( @xmath215 ) in the denominator , which exactly cancel the loop factors from the recoupling .",
    "the final result can be written as : @xmath216 where the arguments of the six tetrahedral networks are those that appear in the last line of figure  [ fig : ladrecoupling ] .",
    "the explicit relation between the tetrahedral network and the wigner - racah @xmath214 symbols is @xmath217 note the row swap and the fact that the four theta networks correspond to the four triples of spins from the @xmath214 s arguments that must satisfy triangle inequalities . for reference , @xmath218 .",
    "next we consider a different splitting of the vertices of the octahedron , which we call the tetrahedral recoupling .",
    "the @xmath58 symbol that arises here is more efficient to compute than the @xmath58 symbol for the ladder recoupling , because it does not require a sum . however , the splitting is not translation invariant , which makes it slightly harder to work with .",
    "this section is not needed in the rest of the paper , but is useful as a comparison to other sources and will be important for future calculations .",
    "we begin by considering a different basis for the space of intertwiners @xmath160 .",
    "it is given by the _",
    "horizontal splitting _ @xmath219 as @xmath34 varies over admissible spins .",
    "note that it makes no difference which way the arrow on the edge labelled by @xmath34 points .",
    "there is also a second horizontal splitting , given by interchanging @xmath189 and @xmath190 . as we did for the vertical splitting ,",
    "we choose between the two by requiring that @xmath190 and @xmath187 label plaquettes that are part of the same cube . unlike the vertical splitting , the two horizontal splittings are not in general related by a sign .      for the tetrahedral recoupling , we use the vertical splitting   on three edges and the horizontal splitting on the opposite edges .",
    "the pattern we use is indicated in the first step of figure  [ fig : tetrecoupling ] .        for this recoupling ,",
    "a minor complication arises because the intertwiner splittings are different on opposite edges .",
    "this means that a simple translation of the given tetrahedral @xmath58 symbol to neighboring vertices does not correspond to a consistent choice of basis for the intertwiners .",
    "this is easily overcome by dividing the lattice into a checkerboard of odd and even sites , and alternately using the original and reflected versions of the @xmath58 symbol . for periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "this does limit one to lattices with even side - lengths , but this constraint is not serious in practice .    as was the case with the ladder recoupling ,",
    "the conversion sign factors from the normalization factors cancel , and the conversion sign factors from the @xmath58 symbols give a factor of @xmath211 . in this case , because the checkerboard pattern forces even side - lengths , one can show that @xmath223 .    the diagrammatic relation @xmath224{collapse } } }   \\label{eq : collapse}\\ ] ] can be used to collapse each of the four triangles into 3-valent vertices , as shown in the last step of figure  [ fig : tetrecoupling ] .",
    "the final result is simply:@xmath225 because this formula is essentially a product of tetrahedral networks with no auxiliary summations , it is highly efficient to compute .",
    "the tetrahedral recoupling is easy to express in terms of wigner - racah @xmath214 symbols using relation  . in order to compare our work to other work",
    ", we give some of the details . ignoring signs for the moment , the theta networks from the edge normalizations   and  , the conversion formula  , and the vertex amplitude   all cancel .",
    "now we collect the signs of the theta networks .",
    "the theta networks from the edge normalizations contribute a sign of @xmath226 , where @xmath34 labels the edge and the @xmath227 label the incident plaquettes . since each plaquette is shared by four edges , the factors @xmath228 cancel .",
    "thus the edge normalizations become @xmath229 .",
    "since this is positive , we can multiply each vertex amplitude by @xmath230 to take this into account .",
    "the theta networks from   contribute a sign of @xmath231 , where the @xmath232 label the edges incident on the vertex .",
    "since each edge is shared by two vertices , the vertex signs also cancel .",
    "the final answer is that the vertex amplitude   becomes a product of five wigner - racah @xmath214 symbols multiplied by a product of six factors of the form @xmath230 .",

    "@xcite and later used by diakonov and petrov  @xcite .",
    "the same formula was used in the computational work of dass  @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that previous derivations of this formula did not make use of the spin foam formalism . as such , the identification of extra labels ( those not coming from original plaquettes ) with intertwiners was not explicit .",
    "we found this distinction between plaquette and intertwiner labels to be a crucial one in constructing our algorithm .",
    "as mentioned in definition 2.4 , when a ( single ) spin foam cube move is applied , the 12 intertwiner labels of the selected cube have to be adjusted to ensure the result is an admissible spin foam . in general ,",
    "admissible intertwiner changes depend on plaquette and edge labels of the cube .",
    "however , we will show next that this dependence takes on a simple form determined by the edge splittings .    for this discussion , we consider the case where the edges are split according to the ladder recoupling of the @xmath58 symbol ( see figure  [ fig : ladrecoupling ] ) , as the translation invariance of this recoupling simplifies the analysis . from the point of view of a cube move ,",
    "edge splittings come in two kinds , see figure  [ fig : itwiners](a ) .",
    "in one case , octahedral edges corresponding to adjacent cube plaquettes remain _ adjacent _ after the intertwiner edge is introduced ( type a ) . in the other , octahedral edges corresponding to adjacent cube plaquettes become _ bridged _ by the new intertwiner edge ( type b ) . the pattern of type a and type b edges for a cube is shown in figure  [ fig : itwiners](b ) .",

    "<S> in the past several decades there have been a number of proposals for computing with dual forms of non - abelian yang - mills theories on the lattice . motivated by the gauge - invariant , geometric picture offered by dual models and successful applications of duality in the @xmath0 case </S>",
    "<S> , we revisit the question of whether it is practical to perform numerical computation using non - abelian dual models . specifically , we consider three - dimensional @xmath1 pure yang - mills as an accessible yet non - trivial case in which the gauge group is non - abelian . using methods developed recently in the context of spin foam quantum gravity , we derive an algorithm for efficiently computing the dual amplitude and describe metropolis moves for sampling the dual ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> we relate our algorithms to prior work in non - abelian dual computations of hari dass and his collaborators , addressing several problems that have been left open . </S>",
    "<S> we report results of spin expectation value computations over a range of lattice sizes and couplings that are in agreement with our conventional lattice computations . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with an outlook on further development of dual methods and their application to problems of current interest .    </S>",
