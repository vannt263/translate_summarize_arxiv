    "inspired by the anti - de sitter / conformal field theories ( ads / cft ) correspondence , it has been argued that there exists remarkable connection between the gravitational physics and the condensed matter physics ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "it was shown that when the temperature of the black hole drops below the critical value , the bulk ads black hole becomes unstable and scalar hair condenses on the black hole background .",
    "the emergence of the scalar hair in the bulk ads black hole corresponds to the formation of a charged condensation in the boundary dual cfts . due to the potential applications to the condensed matter physics",
    ", the condensation in the ads black hole background has been investigated extensively , see for example @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a lot of studies have been done in the probe approximation .",
    "recently attempts to study the holographic superconductor away from the probe limit by considering the backreaction have been carried out in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "most holographic superconductors were constructed in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions or higher - dimensions .",
    "recently the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional holographic superconductor was constructed by using the @xmath0 correspondence @xcite .",
    "the banados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz ) black hole was taken as the gravity background in the construction .",
    "this background is interesting , since in this background the ads / cft correspondence was first quantitatively proved by finding the quasinormal frequencies of the perturbation in the bulk spacetime in coincidence with the poles of the correlation function in the dual cft @xcite . in @xcite distinctive features in both normal and superconducting phases in the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional holographic superconductor were disclosed in the probe limit . since in the @xmath1 spacetime",
    ", the full current - current correlation function is analytically solvable at finite temperature and zero chemical potential , the frequency and momentum dependence of the conductivity which describes the linear response to both temporally and spatially oscillating electric field was obtained .",
    "it is of interest to generalize the study of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional holographic superconductor away from the probe limit by considering the backreaction .",
    "this will be the first task in our work .",
    "furthermore we will study the dynamical properties of the perturbation of charged scalar field in the btz background , which can help us further understand the constructed ( 1 + 1)-dimensional holographic superconductor .    in studying the holographic superconductor",
    ", one has to analyze the asymptotic behavior of a scalar field of mass @xmath2 in bulk ads spacetime with the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the dimension of the space and @xmath6 the ads radius .",
    "usually , normalizability requires that the leading coefficient in @xmath7 must vanish .",
    "however , since we have chosen a mass close to the breitenlohner - freedman ( bf ) bound , even the leading term in @xmath7 is normalizable . in this case , one has a choice to consider solutions either with @xmath8 or @xmath9 . in the dual theory ,",
    "the operator charged under the u(1 ) is dual to @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath10 is close to the bf bound , there are two possible operators depending on how one quantizes @xmath7 in the bulk .",
    "depending on the choice of boundary conditions , we can read off the expectation value of an operator @xmath11 , or of an operator @xmath12 @xcite . in order to apply the formalism in gravity to study the real condensed matter physics ,",
    "one may ask which one of the two possible operators can really reflect the properties of the real condensation . in @xcite , it was found that both operators condensate qualitatively similar to that obtained in bcs theory as observed in many materials when the temperature drops under a critical value , but one of them appears divergence at very low temperature .",
    "this divergence was expected to be cured by considering the backreaction of the scalar field on the bulk metric . in @xcite",
    ", it was argued that the condensation gap indicated in the operator marks the ease of the scalar hair to be formed in the ads black hole background . whether the easiness of the formation of scalar hair can be reflected consistently in two operators",
    "is a question to be asked . in the study of the gauss - bonnet effect on the condensation in the probe limit",
    ", it was found that two operators can not reflect the consistent behavior in the condensation influenced by the gauss - bonnet factor except that we consider the direct signature of gauss - bonnet factor in the scalar mass by selecting the value @xmath13 instead of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to examine whether these two operators can reflect the consistent behavior of condensation when the backreaction is taken into account . in this work",
    ", we will concentrate our attention on ( 1 + 1)-dimensional holographic superconductor and generalize our discussion to higher dimensions .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the fully backreacted one - dimensional holographic superconductor and investigate the dependence of condensate on the backreaction . in section iii , we study the dynamics of the backreacted btz black hole .",
    "we will conclude in the last section of our main results .",

    "the imaginary part of the lowest quasinormal frequency has larger deviation from zero .",
    "this implies that the stronger backreaction can ensure the system to be more stable and can slow down the process to make the high temperature black hole phase become marginally stable . with the decrease of the black hole temperature ,",

    "the correlation length is bigger for the same deviation from the critical point of the system , which means that it is easier for the system to approach the phase transition point when the backreaction is smaller .",

    "this phenomenon was also observed in the study of the effect of the backreaction in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional holographic superconductor @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath71 in our paper is similar to @xmath72 [ 25 ] .",
    "the gaps of condensation increase with the increase of the backreaction for these two operators as reported in our manuscript and in [ 25 ] .",
    "@xmath52 in our paper is similar to @xmath73 in [ 25 ] , where these two gaps of the condensation increase when the backreaction decreases .    in [ 25 ] , @xmath73 is of mass dimension one operator , which is related to the asymptotic behavior @xmath74 at infinity . in that case , the mass was not equal to the bf bound . in our case , when the bf bound is approached , @xmath52 can have the similar asymptotic behavior @xmath75 .",
    "the condensation gap indicated in the operator marks the ease of the scalar hair to be formed[19,20 ] . it should reflect the consistent influence of the backreaction as that shown in the critical temperature and dynamical perturbation .",
    "however , we found that one of the two operators can not exhibit the consistency .",
    "we argued that this inconsistency tells us that this operator is not appropriate to describe the condensation .",
