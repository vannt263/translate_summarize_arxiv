    "we can then cut - off the nonlinearities outside this absorbing set to obtain a modified system which has , almost surely , the same long time , slow dynamics as the original system @xcite . in the following calculations ,",
    "we actually have omitted this cut - off procedure for simplicity .    by the random transformation , sdes system - are converted into the following system @xmath102 therefore , there exists an @xmath53 satisfying @xmath103 whose graph is a random slow manifold for the random system - .",
