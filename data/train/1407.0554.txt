    "the data analysis is carried out by taking all the precautions that were taken in papers  i and ii . we determined the annual variations in the sums of the areas of sunspot groups in different @xmath11 latitude intervals .",
    "the calculations were done for each year data separately and also by binning the data into 3-year moving time intervals ( 3-year mtis ) successively shifted by one year during the period 18742013 , for the sake of better statistics .",

    "the long - term periodicities in the north - south differences ( n - s asymmetries ) of the sums of the areas of sunspot groups in different @xmath11 latitude intervals are determined from the fft analysis , the values of the periodicities are determined by using mem , and the morlet wavelet analysis is used to find the temporal dependence in the periodicities . in the case of long and evenly spaced time series ( windows ) , fourier transform method is a powerful tool , whereas in the case of short time series the fourier components can only determined at harmonics of the fundamental frequency .",
    "besides fft we have used here mem because it is a powerful spectral method for detecting the relevant longer periodicities from a short time series  ( a brief description about the mem and the wavelet analysis is given below , also see * ? ? ?",
    "essentially mem involves fitting an autoregressive model to the data based on the principle that the resultant spectral estimate should be based on all the information in the actual record and assume the least possible amount of information ( hence the name maximum entropy ) about the series outside the observed record .",
    "the condition for this happens to be satisfied by the @xmath41th order autoregressive process .",
    "an important step in this method is the optimum selection of @xmath41 , which is the number of immediately previous points that have been used in the calculation of a new point .",
    "if @xmath41 is chosen too low the spectrum is over - smoothed and the high resolution potential is lost . if @xmath41 is chosen too high , frequency shifting and spontaneous splitting of the spectral peaks occurs , giving a false peaky appearance to the spectrum .",
    "objective methods for selecting @xmath41 have been suggested by a number of authors  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the mem code which we have used here takes the values for @xmath41 in the range ( @xmath42/3 , @xmath42/2 ) @xcite or @xmath43 @xcite , where @xmath42 is the size of a time series .",
    "we have computed mem power spectra choosing various values for @xmath41 in the range ( @xmath42/3 , @xmath42/2 ) and @xmath43 .",
    "we find that @xmath44 is suitable in the present mem analysis , @xmath45 , in the derived spectra the peaks are considerably sharp and separated .",
    "wavelet analysis helps to find simultaneously the periodicities in a time series and the temporal dependence in the corresponding amplitudes of the periodicities .",
    "we have used the wavelet idl code provided by ch .",
    "torrence and g. p. compo as described in @xcite .",
    "a wavelet is a function with zero mean and that is localised in both frequency and time .",
    "the morlet wavelet is defined as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is dimensionless frequency and @xmath48 is dimensionless time .",
    "the morlet wavelet ( with @xmath49 ) is a good choice , because it provides a good balance between time and frequency space  @xcite .",

    "there are other relatively short periodicities ( 7-year , 5.5-year and 4-year ) , but they can be seen mainly in the mem spectrum that correspond to @xmath73 latitude interval . overall the known @xmath74 year periodicity in the n - s asymmetry of the sunspot area  @xcite exists mainly in below @xmath75 latitudes ( it is very weak in @xmath73 latitude interval ) .",
    "the @xmath4 12.5-year periodicity , which is found in n - s asymmetry of sunspot activity  @xcite , is much clear in the mem spectrum that correspond to @xmath5 latitude interval .",
    "the 4455 year cycles can be seen in both @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( see fig .  4 ) .    as can be seen in fig .",

    "the temporal dependence of the @xmath4 12.5-year periodicity is not clear in the other two latitude intervals . in the wavelet",
    "spectra the @xmath460-year periodicity is not well defined , i.e. it is within the cross - hatched region throughout the period 18752013 .",

    "we calculated the cross - correlations between @xmath55 and annual @xmath78 , and also between @xmath56 and annual @xmath79 ( in the case of @xmath78 , @xmath52 represents actual year ) .",
    "for this purpose also the time series of 3-year mtis are used .",
    "we determined the cross - correlations , besides in @xmath80 latitude interval , in @xmath81 and @xmath82 latitude intervals also .",
    "the cross correlations are shown in fig .",
    "as can be seen in this figure , the cross - correlation coefficient ( @xmath83 ) varies systematically ( damped wave like behaviour ) with _ lag _ ( absolute ) , implying that the area - sums vary systematically similar to @xmath7 . in the case of @xmath5 latitude interval ,",
    "the peak of @xmath84 at @xmath85 is large ( with value 0.79 ) and statically high significant as that of the one close to @xmath86 ( with value 0.83 ) .",
    "the peak of @xmath87 is much smaller ( 0.66 ) at @xmath85 , and slightly larger ( 0.83 ) at @xmath86 , than the corresponding peaks of @xmath88 . in the cases of @xmath1 and @xmath73 latitude intervals , @xmath88 and @xmath87",
    "have dominant peaks at @xmath89 and @xmath90 , receptively and the peaks at @xmath85 are considerably smaller than the corresponding one of @xmath88 in @xmath5 latitude interval .",
    "the differences between the peaks of @xmath87 and @xmath88 are larger in the case of @xmath5 latitude intervals than corresponding differences in the other two latitude intervals , particularly for negative values of @xmath91 .",
    "a peak of _ ccf _ at a negative value of @xmath91 implies that the corresponding @xmath92 or @xmath93 leads @xmath7 .",
    "that is , in the case of @xmath88 of @xmath5 latitude interval the presence of a dominant peak at @xmath85 implies @xmath93 leads @xmath7 by about nine years .",
    "this is consistent with the high correlation between @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( @xmath96 rel2 ) .",
    "9 shows the scatter plot of @xmath56 of the sunspot groups in @xmath3 latitude interval of the southern hemisphere versus @xmath97 . in this figure",
    "the continuous curve represents the following linear relationship between @xmath56 and @xmath97 :    @xmath98    the corresponding values of the correlation coefficient ( @xmath99 ) and the slope are statistically high significant ( derived from 128 data points , from the student s t - test @xmath100 ) .",
    "10 shows the plots of the simulated ( by using equation  ( 4 ) ) and the observed values of the yearly mean @xmath7 versus time ( year ) . in this figure",
    "it can be seen that the shape of the simulated cycle  24 is almost same as the pattern of temporal behaviour of @xmath56 of the sunspot groups in @xmath3 latitude interval of the southern hemisphere during cycle  23 ( see fig .",
    "the simulated value @xmath101 for @xmath22 of cycle  24 is almost equal to the observed as well as the simulated values of @xmath22 of cycle  23 , a contradiction to all the corresponding predictions for @xmath22 of cycle  24 in papers  i and ii .",
    "the simulated amplitudes of some small / large cycles are considerably larger / smaller than the corresponding observed amplitudes , causing the uncertainty of the simulated value is high ( @xmath102 ) , making the reliability of this simulated @xmath22 of cycle  24 is lower than the previous predictions that were made by using rel2 ( or even that was made by using rel1 ) . as per the current level of sunspot activity it seems to be almost certain that the simulated value is much higher than the real observed amplitude of cycle  24 .",
    "in fact , in paper  ii we have noticed that a higher value of predicted @xmath22 correspond to a lower value of @xmath103 .",
    "the lengths of solar cycles considerably very . in addition , the wavelet analysis suggests that the long - term periodicities in @xmath104 are time dependent .",
    "consequently , for prediction purpose it is not possible to use directly the continuous time series of @xmath56 in equal time intervals .",
    "that is , it is necessary to take the variations in the lengths of solar cycle into account .",
    "it should be noted here that even in the case of the prediction of @xmath22 of a cycle by using the polar fields at minimum of the cycle could more uncertain and fail if the polar fields were used early before the start of the cycle  @xcite .",
    "that is , in our method also it is necessary to find the exact epoch in which the sum of the areas of the sunspot groups highly correlated with @xmath22 of next cycle .",
    "for the same reason we have used the method described in papers  i and ii and found rel1 and rel2 .    in fig .",
    "10 there is an indication that 2011 is the epoch of maximum of cycle  24 .",
    "there is a suggestion that this cycle also may be somewhat long and the next minimum may be also weak similar to the last ( between cycles  23 and 24 ) very weak minimum .",
    "there is also a suggestion that a secondary peak will occur in the year 2014 .",
    "the rise to maximum may be also steep in cycle  24 as that of cycle  23 .",
    "interestingly , within the year 2011 a very large peak exists in the monthly variation in @xmath7 ( the corresponding figure is not shown here ) .",
    "some recent analysis suggested that in the northern hemisphere the maximum is already occurred in the year 2011 , but not in the southern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "since we have correlated the 3-year mti s sum of the areas of sunspot groups with the annual mean @xmath105 ( mean of the monthly mean values of @xmath7 ) , one can expect the uncertainties up to 12 months in the simulated epochs of maxima and minima .",
    "however , overall we can draw a conclusion that the eq .",
    "( 4 ) is not much useful for prediction purpose .",
    "( there is a considerable spread in fig .  9 .",
    "the error in the sum of the areas of sunspot groups is an essential part of the present analysis , but that error is difficult to generate here because the values of the errors in the areas of sunspot groups are not available / known . )",
    "rel2 is essentially a special case of the @xmath106 relationship ( cf .",
    ", conclusion  2 and eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) correspond to the peak of _ ccf _ at @xmath85 year .",
    "the peak of _ ccf _ at @xmath107 years suggest the existence of a relation between @xmath22 and @xmath58 of a cycle , but we find a very weak correlation ( @xmath108 ) between these parameters of a cycle .",
    "that is , @xmath7 of a year may have an effect on @xmath93 of the following year , but may not be beyond one year .",
    "therefore , it seems @xmath22 of cycle does not have a strong affect on @xmath109 of the same cycle . @xmath58 may represent the proxy of new magnetic flux or largely the magnetic flux that transported from the northern hemisphere do to the equatorial cross of the flux at @xmath61 .",
    "it should be noted here , @xmath61 is close to the epoch of global change in the sign of the solar magnetic field .",
    "that is , overall it seems rel2 related to the global change in the sign of the solar magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath61 of cycle @xmath14 and @xmath20 of cycle @xmath16 are at the beginning and at about one year before the ending of a half solar magnetic cycle , respectively .",
    "it is not clear whether the rel2 related to the approximate 9-year periodicity in the north - south difference of the sum of the areas of sunspot groups in the @xmath3 latitude intervals of the northern and southern hemispheres , because the wavelet analyses suggest that the approximate 9-year periodicity does not exist continuously throughout 18752013 .",
    "as already mentioned in section  1 , although the values of of the corresponding correlation coefficients of both the relations rel1 and rel2 are almost equal and high , they yielded a substantial different values for the amplitude of solar cycle  24 , @xmath38 @xmath110 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "a plausible reason for this could be due to the missing of some normalisation factor between these relationships .",
    "on the other hand , the rel2 is better defined than that of rel1 , in the sense that the intercepts of the corresponding linear equations have a small ( @xmath111 ) and a large ( @xmath112 ) values , respectively .",
    "that is , one - to - one correspondence between @xmath22 and @xmath109 is much stronger than that between @xmath22 and @xmath113 .",
    "observationally , the uncertainty in @xmath113 is more than that in @xmath109 because the data near the maximum of a solar cycle is well measured(/defined ) than that at the minimum . by solving eq .",
    "( 1 ) that correspond to rel1 and eq .",
    "( 3 ) that correspond to rel2 , we get a new equation which is free of constant term . from this way in paper - i it was obtained @xmath114 for @xmath22 of cycle  24 . similarly , if we solve eqs .  ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , we get    @xmath115    by using eq .  ( 5 )",
    "we get @xmath116 for @xmath22 of cycle  24 which is almost equal to the value of the first peak of cycle  24 . as per the current level of sunspot activity , it is almost certain that this , and the value @xmath40 that was predicted by using rel2 alone , will be very close to the reality .",
    "the value of about 100 found from rel1 for amplitude of cycle  24 seems to be certainly failed .",
    "however , by using rel1 it seems still possible to make a prediction qualitatively ( @xmath45 , it seems to be possible to find whether the next cycle is stronger or weaker than the immediate previous one ) by 13-year advance ( that was the major conclusion about the values that were obtained by using rel1 in papers i and ii ) . for this",
    ", one can also utilise the following relationship : @xmath117 .",
    "that is , first obtain the approximate value of @xmath118 by using this relationship and then by substituting that in eq .",
    "( in paper  ii some other simple additions of the values of the parameters of rel1 and rel2 were carried out and obtained few other values , obviously they are incorrect though each one of them is less than the amplitude of cycle  23 .",
    "even these earlier predictions indicated that certainly cycle  24 will be weaker than cycle  23 ) .",
    "the maximum ( in @xmath7 ) of a solar cycle is not smooth .",
    "two or more peaks can be identified during the solar maxima and are called gnevyshev peaks , because this splitting of activity was identified for the first time by gnevyshev  ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the time interval between these peaks , where the level of activity is relatively low , is known as the gnevyshev gap ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "incidentally , the epochs of @xmath61 seem to be close to the gnevyshev gaps and also close to the time when the sign of the magnetic field is changing in the northern and southern hemispheres . at these occasions",
    "there could be interactions of the plasma flows of opposite polarities causing cancellation of magnetic flux .",
    "( at these occasions of a cycle downward flow may also taking place , which may provide required resource for next cycle . )",
    "overall , it seems rel2 related to the global change in the sign of the solar magnetic field .",
    "in fact , the @xmath61 of cycle @xmath14 and @xmath20 of cycle @xmath16 are at the beginning and near the ending of a same half solar magnetic cycle , respectively .",
    "@xcite suggested that the double peaks and the gnevyshev gap in sunspot maximum can be explained as the sunspot maximum is the superposition of the two surges of toroidal magnetic field generated by two parts of the poloidal field .",
    "one part generated at the surface is advected by the meridional circulation all the way to the poles and another part is diffused directly to the tachocline at mid - latitudes .",
    "one can also think that the cause of the gnevyshev peaks / gaps may be due to interaction of at least two magnetic waves whose amplitudes and phases are different .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( 5 ) , which is the linear combination of eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , may be having the aforementioned physical background rather than mere mathematical .    here",
    "we have used soon sunspot data for seven more years and found that the latest @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( with reference to the first peak of @xmath7 at 2012.170 ) are 2007.552011.05 and 2013.172013.92 , and the values of the corresponding @xmath57 and @xmath58 are 0.48 and 18.86 , respectively .    in principle , according to rel1 , @xmath45 by using eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , it should be possible to make a prediction for @xmath22 of solar cycle  25 . by using eq .",
    "( 2 ) we obtained @xmath119 for @xmath22 of cycle  25 , which is much lower than the corresponding predicted value ( @xmath110 ) for @xmath22 of cycle  24 , but @xmath120 of cycle  24 is much less than 84 .",
    "therefore , this result only indicates that the cycle  25 could be relatively weaker ( not represents the amplitude of cycle  24 ) , suggesting that the rel1 ( eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) can be used to make a qualitative prediction for the amplitude of a cycle .",
    "that is , eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can be used to know whether the amplitude of next cycle is less or greater than that of previous one , by about 13 year advance .",
    "on the other hand by using rel2 , @xmath45 by using eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we can make a reasonably accurate prediction . by using using eq .",
    "( 3 ) we get @xmath121 for @xmath22 of cycle 25 . by using eq .  ( 5 ) we get @xmath122 ( note : in this case the latest value of @xmath123 ) .",
    "we would like to make the following clarifications about our methods of analysis : fig .",
    "11 shows the changes in the correlations as the changes in @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "here we have used 1.0 year ( instead of 0.05 year used in papers  i and ii ) increase / decrease in each successive iteration .",
    "the end points of the time intervals ( represented by the interval numbers ) are away from @xmath19 and @xmath20 as follows : intervals 1 , 2 , 3 , 4,  ,7 are at ( -2 , -1 ) ( -2 , 0),(-2 , 1),(-2 , 2), ",
    ",(-2 , 5 ) years away , respectively ; the end points of the intervals 8 , 9,  ,13 are at ( -1 , 0 ) ( -1 , 1), ",
    ",(-1 , 5 ) years away , respectively ; similarly , the end points of the intervals 19 , 20,  ,22 are at ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 1 , 3),  ,(1 , 5 ) years away , respectively ; and those of the intervals 26 and 27 are at ( 3 , 4 ) and ( 3 , 5 ) years away , respectively . in the intervals 4 and 19",
    "the corresponding correlation coefficients have large values , 0.85 and 0.91 , respectively . from @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "the end points of the intervals 4 and 19 are at ( -2 , 2 ) and ( 1 , 2 ) years away , respectively , and obviously @xmath60 and @xmath61 are within these intervals , respectively .",
    "the increase / decrease time 0.05 year that was used in papers i and ii for accurately determining @xmath60 and @xmath61 may be small , but @xmath60 , and even @xmath61 , are relatively long and the corresponding correlations are still high with plus or minus of a few times of 0.05 year from these intervals .",
    "that is , there is a considerable consistency in the data sampling .    in fig .",
    "11 ( which demonstrates the methodology used in papers  i and ii ) there are steep changes in the correlation coefficient correspond to the data in @xmath5 latitude interval of the southern hemisphere , and the variation in the correlation coefficient correspond to the data in @xmath5 latitude interval of the northern hemisphere is somewhat gradual . in fig .  2",
    "one can find that the aforementioned steep / gradual changes seen in fig .",
    "11 is a property of the solar cycle variations in the sum of the areas of the sunspot groups in @xmath5 latitude interval of the southern / northern hemisphere .",
    "that is , @xmath61 is close to the epoch of maximum ( peak ) of the solar cycle variation in the sum of the areas of the sunspot groups in @xmath5 latitude interval of the southern hemisphere , where obviously the variation is steep .",
    "the @xmath60 is close to the epoch of minimum of the solar cycle variation in the sum of the areas of sunspot groups in @xmath5 latitude interval of the northern hemisphere , where the variation is somewhat gradual .",
    "these results strongly indicate that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are reasonably well defined and hence both the relations rel1 and rel2 are reliable .",
    "we analysed the combined greenwich and soon sunspot group data during the period 18742013 and found the following results :    1 .   in the difference between the sums of the areas of the sunspot groups in @xmath3 latitude intervals of northern and southern hemispheres",
    ", there exist @xmath4 9-year periodicity during the high activity period 19401980 and @xmath4 12-year periodicity during the low activity period 18901939 .",
    "2 .   there exists a high correlation ( 85% from 128 data points ) between the sum of the areas of the sunspot groups in @xmath5 latitude interval of the southern hemisphere during a @xmath6th year and ( @xmath7 ) of ( @xmath8)th year .",
    "3 .   by using the above relationship ( conclusion  2 )",
    "it is not possible to make an accurate prediction for the amplitude of a solar cycle .",
    "because of the lengths of solar cycles considerably very and the long - term periodicities in @xmath104 are time dependent ( conclusion  1 ) , it is necessary to find the exact epoch in which the sum of the areas of the sunspot groups highly correlated with @xmath22 of next cycle .",
    "thus , rel2 is a special case of the above relationship ( conclusion  2 ) . by using rel2 ( eq .  ( 3 ) ) it",
    "is possible for predicting the amplitude of a solar cycle with a good accuracy .",
    "we predict @xmath121 for the amplitude of the next cycle  25 , which is about 31% lower than the amplitude of cycle  24 ( in fact , it seems to be lowest compare with the amplitudes of cycles  124 . ) .    according to gnevyshev and ohl rule  @xcite or g - o - rule",
    "an odd numbered cycle is always stronger than its preceding even numbered cycle . by using the g - o rule it will not be possible to predict the amplitude of solar cycle  25 when the amplitude of solar cycle  24 is known , unless the epochs of the violations of the g - o rule is known in well advance . using the relations rel1 and rel2",
    "it is possible to predict @xmath22 of any cycle , @xmath45 an even  numbered solar cycle as well as an odd  numbered solar cycle ( no need to know in advance the epochs of violations of the g - o rule ) .",
    "the violation of the g - o rule is followed by a few ( at least one ) relatively weak solar cycles ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "for example , solar cycle pair ( 4 , 5 ) was followed by weak solar cycles  6 and 7 , solar cycle pair ( 8 , 9 ) was also followed a relatively week cycle 10 .",
    "thus , one or two weak solar cycles which follow solar cycle pair ( 22 , 23 ) may be also relatively weak .",
    "the low values predicted above for solar cycles  24 and 25 are consistent with this long - term property of solar activity .",
    "the predicted amplitudes of cycles  24 and 25 suggest that the g - o rule will be violated by this cycle pair ( 24 , 25 ) also .",
    "that is , it seems for the first time violation of g - o rule takes place in two consecutive pairs of even- and odd - numbered solar cycles , ( 22 , 23 ) and ( 24 , 25 ) , since g - o rule was discovered .    the long term trend , in fact , extrapolation of the cosine curve shown in fig .  5 of @xcite from the epoch of cycle  23",
    ", suggests that solar cycles  24 and 25 will be relatively weak cycles .",
    "the above predicted amplitudes of solar cycles  24 and 25 are consistent with this result .",
    "thus , our predictions are also consistent with the speculation that the minimum of the current gleissberg cycle will take place in cycle  25 @xcite .",
    "the current long - term minimum ( shall include cycles  24 and 25 ) is at the end of the current gleissberg cycle ( preceding minimum of the next gleissberg cycle ) and it may be similar to the recent modern minimum ( or even to the dalton minimum ) .    since our results / predictions are based on the north - south asymmetries in the sums of the areas of the sunspot groups in the heliographic latitudes that are close to the equator , cancellation / enhancement of magnetic flux due to equatorial crossings of magnetic flux ( caused by the solar meridional flows ) may have a major rule in the mechanism behind our methodology / results .",
