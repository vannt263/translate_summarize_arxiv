    "long flexible polymer macromolecules in a good solvent possess configurational statistics , which is perfectly captured by the model of self - avoiding random walks ( saw ) on a regular lattice @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the _ regime of polymer coils _ which holds provided that the temperature @xmath3 is above the so - called @xmath4-temperature . in this regime ,",
    "the mean end - to - end distance of an @xmath5-step chain scales as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an universal exponent , which depends on space dimension @xmath8 only . with lowering the temperature",
    ", the effect of monomer - monomer attraction grows and the polymer radius shrinks . at @xmath9 the effective repulsion due to the volume exclusion constraint",
    "is exactly balanced by attractive interactions . at this particular temperature",
    "a crossover occurs from high temperature saw behavior to @xmath4-statistics with exponent @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 . below the @xmath4-temperature ,",
    "the entropic effects , which make the polymer chain swell , are overcome by interaction energy and a collapse to the _ globule regime _ ( with collapsed size exponent @xmath12 ) occurs .",
    "it is generally accepted @xcite that the coil - globule transition is of second order , in the sense that the density of an infinite globule is zero at @xmath9 and increases continuously when @xmath3 is lowered further ; more presicely , it is a tricritical point with the upper critical dimension @xmath13 .",
    "the coil - globule transition is one of the fundamental problems in polymer physics @xcite , being deeply connected with problems like protein folding , dna condensation and chromatin organization .",
    "the properties of polymers in the vicinity of the @xmath4-point can be successfully studied on the basis of self - attractive self - avoiding walks ( sasaw ) , where a nearest - neighbor interaction is included .",
    "estimates of the transition temperature @xmath2 for flexible polymers have been so far the subject of numerous studies @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath4-temperature is a non - universal quantity , depending on the lattice type ; in particular it appears to be proportional to the connectivity constant @xmath14 of a saw on a given type of lattice ( recent estimates of @xmath14 and @xmath4-temperatures on simple square and cubic lattices are given in table 1 ) .",
    "the recent progress in experimental techniques employing optical tweezers @xcite , atomic force microscopy @xcite and soft microneedles @xcite makes it possible to monitor the behavior of various polymers under tension and stress .",
    "in particular , applying a force on an isolated protein , the mechanism of force - driven phase transitions was studied , such as unfolding of giant titine protein @xcite , the stretching and unzipping of collapsed dna molecules @xcite .",
    "of special interest in biophysics is the stretching of a collapsed polymer , i.e. , of a polymer in a poor solvent below the @xmath4-temperature .",
    "unfolding proteins in this way could give important information on their spontaneous folding pathways .",
    "an intriguing question is whether intermediate stages observed in different protein denaturating processes under applying force would always correspond to folding pathways in an enforced environment @xcite .",
    "note that varying temperature alone , a polymer can not acquire the conformation of the completely stretched state with size exponent @xmath15 .",
    "hence force not only influences the elastic , mechanical and structural properties of polymers , but also introduces a new stretched state ( _ regime of string _ ) which is otherwise not accessible .",
    "the properties of force - induced globule - coil and coil - string transitions in @xmath0 , @xmath1 have been studied intensively both analytically @xcite and applying numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the existence of many intermediate states was found when unfolding under an applied force , which are not the same as the thermodynamically stable intermediate states .",
    "the phase diagrams of the globule - coil and coil - string coexistence when varying temperature and stretching force were constructed .",
    "new challenges have been raised recently in studying protein folding in the natural cellular environment @xcite .",
    "real biological cells can be described as a very crowded environment built of the biochemical species , which occupy a large fraction of the total volume ; the  volume exclusion \" arises due to the steric repulsion between molecules @xcite . in the language of lattice models , the crowded environment with structural obstacles can be considered as a disordered lattice , where some amount of randomly chosen sites contains defects . of particular interest is the case , when the concentration @xmath16 of lattice sites allowed for the saws equals the critical concentration @xmath17 ( @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 @xcite ) and the lattice becomes percolative .",
    "an incipient percolation cluster appears in the system , on which infinitely long saws can reside . in this regime ,",
    "the scaling law for the end - to - end distance holds with a new exponent @xmath20 @xcite . a hint to the physical understanding of this phenomenon",
    "is given by the fact that the percolation cluster itself is a fractal object with fractal dimension @xmath21 dependent on @xmath8 . in this way , scaling law exponents of saws change with the dimension @xmath21 of the ( fractal ) lattice on which the walk resides .",
    "note that studying the scaling of saws on a percolative lattice , one is interested rather in the backbone of the percolation cluster , which is defined as follows .",
    "assume that each site of the cluster is a resistor , the neighbour sites are connected by conducting bonds and an external potential drop is applied at two ends of the cluster .",
    "the backbone is the subset of the cluster consisting of all sites through which the current flows ; i.e. , it is the structure left when all  dangling ends \" are eliminated from the cluster .",
    "the saws can be trapped in  dangling ends \" , therefore infinitely long chains can only exist on the backbone of the cluster , which is characterized by its own fractal dimension @xmath22 ( @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath24 @xcite ) .    whereas the scaling behavior of saws on percolative lattices served as a subject of numerous studies since the early 80th ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , less attention has been paid to peculiarities of the influence of the fractal structure of the underlying lattice on properties of the coil - globule transition .",
    "the upper critical dimension shifts to @xmath25 for both saw and @xmath4-point statistics on a disordered lattice at the percolation threshold .",
    "the scaling of polymer size at the coil - globule transition point is governed by @xmath26 for @xmath27 ( e.g. , @xmath28 @xcite , @xmath29 @xcite ) .",
    "it is established that the value of the @xmath4-temperature is lowered due to the presence of disorder @xcite , but estimates for @xmath30 were found up to now only for the case of bond percolation .",
    "the existing estimates are : @xmath31 @xcite , @xmath32 @xcite ( note , that corresponding values of connectivity constant for saw on bond - diluted percolative lattices read : @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath0 and 3 , respectively @xcite ) .",
    "the response of a polymer in crowded media to the stretching force modelled by the sasaw model on percolative lattice has been considered so far only in @xmath0 for relatively short chains by exact enumeration @xcite .",
    "however , much more important is studying this problem in three dimensions , which describes real polymer systems .",
    "this still needs a careful analysis and clarification . also , a quantitative description of the globule - coil transition under applying force , in particular the estimate of @xmath4-temperatures in disordered environment under stretching , still remains an open question .",
    "the aim of the present study is to apply state - of - the - art numerical simulations to analyze the pecularities of sasaws on site - diluted lattices at the percolation threshold ( modelling flexible polymers in crowded environment ) under applied external stretching force in space dimensions @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "we estimate the shift of the @xmath4-temperature of the globule - coil transition under the influence of stretching and analyze the effect of applied force on the phase transitions between collapsed , extended and stretched phases .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the details of the numerical algorithm used in our study . in section",
    "iii we present our results of coil - globule transition peculiarities for saws on percolative lattices , and in section iv we analyze the influence of stretching force on properties of the transition between collapsed and extended states .",
    "we end up by giving conclusions and an outlook in section v.",
    "we consider site percolation on regular lattices of edge lengths up to @xmath35 in dimensions @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "each site of the lattice was assigned to be occupied with probability @xmath37 and empty otherwise . to obtain the backbone of a percolation cluster on a given disordered lattice",
    ", we apply an algorithm consisting of the following two steps : first finding the percolation cluster based on the site - labeling method of hoshen and kopelman @xcite and then extracting the backbone of this cluster @xcite ( the algorithm is explained in detail in our previous papers @xcite ) .",
    "we constructed 1000 clusters in each space dimension .",
    "self - avoding walks on the backbone of a percolation cluster in @xmath0 under stretching force @xmath38.,width=177 ]    to study sasaws on the backbone of percolation clusters , we apply the pruned - enriched rosenbluth method ( perm ) @xcite , taking into account that a sasaw can have its steps only on the sites belonging to the backbone of the percolation cluster . perm is based on the original rosenbluth - rosenbluth ( rr ) method @xcite and enrichment strategies @xcite .",
    "the polymer grows step by step , i.e. , the @xmath39th monomer is placed at a randomly chosen empty neighbor site of the last placed @xmath40th monomer ( @xmath41 , where @xmath5 is the total length of the chain ) .",
    "the growth is stopped , if the total length of the chain is reached . in order to obtain correct statistics , any attempt to place",
    "a monomer at an already occupied site would result in discarding the entire chain .",
    "this leads to an exponential  attrition \" ( the number of discarded chains grows exponentially with the chain length ) .",
    "the bias due to avoiding this case is corrected in the rr algorithm by means of giving a weight @xmath42 to each sample configuration at the @xmath39th step , where @xmath43 is the number of free lattice sites to place the @xmath44th monomer .",
    "this method is particularly useful for studying @xmath4-polymers , since the rosenbluth weights of the statistically relevant chains approximately cancel against their boltzmann probability .",
    "population control in perm suggests pruning configurations with too small weights , and enriching the sample with copies of high - weight configurations @xcite .",
    "these copies are made while the chain is growing , and continue to grow independently of each other . pruning and enrichment",
    "are performed by choosing thresholds @xmath45 and @xmath46 depending on the estimate of the partition sums of the @xmath39-monomer chain .",
    "if the current weight @xmath47 of an @xmath39-monomer chain is less than @xmath45 , a random number @xmath48 is chosen ; if @xmath49 , the chain is discarded , otherwise it is kept and its weight is doubled .",
    "thus , low - weight chains are pruned with probability @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath47 exceeds @xmath46 , the configuration is doubled and the weight of each copy is taken as half the original weight .",
    "for updating the threshold values we apply similar rules as in @xcite : @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes the number of created chains having length @xmath39 , and the parameter @xmath54 controls the pruning - enrichment statistics . after a certain number of chains of total length @xmath5",
    "is produced , the iteration is finished and a new tour starts .",
    "we adjust the pruning - enrichment control parameter such that on average 10 chains of total length @xmath5 are generated per each iteration @xcite , and perform @xmath55 iterations .",
    "one end of the chain is subjected to an external force @xmath38 acting in a chosen direction , say @xmath56 ( see fig . [ sawonpcf ] ) , while the other end ( the starting point ) is kept fixed .",
    "the stretching energy @xmath57 arising due to the applied force for an @xmath39-step trajectory is given by : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the @xmath56-component of distance from the starting point @xmath60 .",
    "the rosenbluth weight factor @xmath47 is thus taken to be : @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the energy of the @xmath44-step chain ( @xmath63 with @xmath64 being an attractive energy between two nearest neighbors and @xmath65 the number of nearest neighbors contacts for a given chain ) and @xmath66 is the boltzmann constant . in what follows , we will assume units in which @xmath67 .",
    "when a chain of total length @xmath5 is constructed , a new one starts from the same starting point , until the desired number of chain configurations is obtained .",
    "the configurational averaging , e.g. , for stretching in @xmath56-direction , is then given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote @xmath56-coordinates of start- and end - points , respectively , and @xmath71 is the weight of an @xmath5-monomer chain in a given configuration .",
    "note , that studying saws on disordered lattices , we have to perform two types of averaging : the first average @xmath72 is performed over all saw configurations on a single backbone of percolation cluster ; the second average @xmath73 is carried out over different realizations of disorder , i.e. , over many backbone configurations .",
    "statistical fluctuations of the energy @xmath74 of a polymer chain , expressed by the behaviour of the specific heat @xmath75 , signalize thermodynamic activity in the system , and thus the peak structure of @xmath75 as a function of temperature indicates transitions or crossovers between physically different states . in the case of a polymer system",

    "we studied the self - attracting self - avoding walks on disordered lattices in space dimensions @xmath0 , @xmath1 , modelling flexible polymer macromolecules in porous environment .",
    "we considered the special case , when the concentration of disorder is exactly at the percolation threshold , so that an incipient percolation cluster of sites , allowed for saws , emerges on the lattice . in our study , sasaws reside only on the backbone of the percolation cluster , which has a fractal structure .    in the first part of our study",
    ", attention has been paid to the influence of the fractal structure of the underlying lattice on properties of the coil - globule transition . applying the pruned - enriched rosenbluth algorithm",
    ", we obtain estimates of the collapse transition temperature @xmath30 of sasaws on site - diluted percolative lattices in @xmath0 and @xmath1 dimensions ( note , that so far only estimates for the bond - percolation case have been found ) .",
    "the values of @xmath30 appear to be smaller than the pure lattice value .",
    "this can be explained , remembering that the collapse transition temperature is proportional to the connectivity constant @xmath14 of saws on a given lattice .",
    "in addition , due to the fact that @xmath111 decreases with @xmath8 , the same tendency is reflected in the anomalous transition temperature behaviour : @xmath112 .    next , keeping one end of a sasaw trajectory on the backbone of percolation cluster fixed , we applied a stretching force , acting in some chosen direction ( say , @xmath56 ) .",
    "especially interesting was to study this problem in @xmath90 , which corresponds to real polymer systems and was not considered before .",
    "we estimated the shift of the @xmath4-temperature of the globule - coil transition under the stretching and constructed phase diagrams of collapsed and extended states coexistence in @xmath94 . as expected , the presence of stretching force in environment leads to a decreasing @xmath4-temperature value .",
