    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is a promising extension of the standard model of particle physics ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "if weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) exists , it should be discovered at the lhc  @xcite , which is scheduled to start in 2008 . however , detailed measurements of the masses , decay widths , couplings , and spins of the discovered particles are only possible at the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite . in the first stage of the ilc ,",
    "the center - of - mass energy will be @xmath10 and the luminosity , @xmath11 , will be @xmath12 within the first four years .",
    "in preparing for the ilc , there is an on - going debate over the extent of beam polarization to be included in the initial design  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that there will be at least 80% polarization of the electron beam , possibly even 90%  @xcite .",
    "a polarized positron beam is technically and financially more involved .",
    "however , it is possible to achieve 30% polarization through the undulator based production of the positrons , already from the start  @xcite .",
    "depending on the undulator length , even a higher degree of positron polarization can be achieved . in light of this discussion , it is the purpose of this letter to reconsider the effect of various degrees of electron and positron polarization on a particular supersymmetric production process , namely the radiative production of the lightest neutralino mass eigenstate @xmath13 @xmath14 we shall focus on specific regions of the supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "the signal is a single , highly energetic photon and missing energy , carried by the neutralinos .",
    "the process  ( [ eexxg ] ) was previously studied within the mssm and with general neutralino mixing in refs .",
    "the additional effect of polarized beams was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that polarized beams significantly enhance the signal and simultaneously suppress the main sm photon background from radiative neutrino production , @xmath15 moreover , it was pointed out that for certain regions of the mssm parameter space , the process  ( [ eexxg ] ) is kinematically the _ only _ accessible susy production mechanism in the first stage of the ilc at @xmath16  @xcite . here the heavier electroweak gauginos and the sleptons are too heavy to be pair produced , _ i.e. _ their masses are above 250 gev",
    ".    other than the standard center - of - mass energy , @xmath17 , at the ilc , also lower energies are of particular interest , namely for higgs and top physics .",
    "higgs strahlung , @xmath18 can be well studied at the threshold energy @xmath19 , which is @xmath20 , for a higgs boson mass of @xmath21 . the cp - quantum number and the spin of the higgs boson can be determined from an energy scan of the production cross section near the threshold  @xcite .    from a scan at the threshold energy of top pair production , @xmath22 , the top mass @xmath23 can be determined with an error @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "thus the present error on the top mass , @xmath25  @xcite , and the foreseen error from lhc measurements , @xmath26  @xcite , can be reduced by one order of magnitude .",
    "also the top width , @xmath27 , and the strong coupling constant , @xmath28 , can be precisely determined by a multi parameter fit of the cross section , top momentum distribution , and forward - backward charge asymmetry near threshold  @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we take these physics questions as a motivation to study the role of polarized beams in radiative neutralino production at the energies @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 at the ilc . for each beam energy , we shall focus on a specific supersymmetric parameter set within the context of minimal supergravity grand unification ( msugra )  @xcite .",
    "we thus consider three msugra scenarios , which we label a , b and c , respectively , and which are listed below in table  [ tab : scenarios ] together with the resulting spectra in table  [ tab : masses ] . we restrict ourselves to msugra scenarios , in order to reduce the number of free parameters and since we find it sufficient to illustrate our point .",
    "the specific scenarios are chosen such that radiative neutralino production is the _ only _ supersymmetric production mechanism which is kinematically accessible at the given center - of - mass energy .",
    "it is thus of particular interest to learn as much about supersymmetry as is possible through this mechanism .",
    "as we shall see , beam polarization is very helpful in this respect .    in sect .",
    "[ definitions ] , we define the significance , the signal to background ratio and define a first set of experimental cuts . in sect .",
    "[ numerics ] , we study numerically the dependence of the signal cross section and the sm background , the significance , and the signal to background ratio on the beam polarization .",
    "in particular , we compare the results for different sets of beam polarizations , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we summarize and conclude in sect .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "we wish to study the beam polarization dependence of the cross sections for the signal process  ( [ eexxg ] ) and the background process  ( [ eenng ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we define the theoretical significance as  @xcite @xmath38 and the signal to background ratio ( or reliability ) as  @xcite @xmath39 here @xmath40 and @xmath41 shall refer to the signal and background cross sections also after the cuts we impose on the final state phase space .",
    "a significance of @xmath42 implies that the signal can be measured at the statistical @xmath43-level .",
    "if the experimental error for the background is , for example , @xmath44 , the signal to background ratio must be greater than @xmath44  @xcite . for a signal to be detectable at the ilc requires at least @xmath45 we remark that these criteria can only be seen as rough estimates to judge whether an excess of signal photons can be measured over the background , since we do not include any detector simulation , with effective particle reconstruction efficiencies .",
    "a detailed monte carlo study is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "for the tree - level calculation of the cross sections , we use the formul for the amplitudes squared as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where details of the neutralino mixing can also be found . to regularize the infrared and collinear divergences of the tree - level cross sections for signal and background , we apply cuts on the photon scattering angle @xmath46  @xcite @xmath47 and on the photon energy @xmath48  @xcite @xmath49 with the beam energy : @xmath50 .",
    "the upper cut on the photon energy @xmath51 is the kinematical limit of radiative neutralino production , and also reduces much of the on - shell @xmath52 boson contribution to the background from radiative neutrino production  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the mass of the lightest neutralino @xmath53 is known from lhc measurements  @xcite .",
    "although @xmath53 can be measured at the percent - level at the lhc , such a precision will not be required for the upper cut @xmath54 , since the endpoint of the photon energy distribution is not densely populated with signal events .",
    "finally , note that the ratios @xmath55 and @xmath56 only weakly depend on the absolute values of the cuts @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , since signal and background have similar distributions in energy @xmath48 and angle @xmath46 , see ref .  @xcite .",
    "we define three msugra scenarios a , b , and c for the three different energies @xmath59 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively , see table  [ tab : scenarios ] .",
    "we choose the three scenarios in such a way , that only the lightest neutralinos can be radiatively produced for each of the @xmath60 values , respectively .",
    "the other susy particles , _",
    "i.e. _ the heavier neutralinos and charginos , as well as the sleptons and squarks are too heavy to be pair produced at the ilc .",
    "it is thus of paramount interest to have an optimal understanding of the signature  ( [ eexxg ] ) , in order to learn as much as possible about susy at a given ilc beam energy .",
    "note that in the three scenarios ( a , b , c ) the squark and gluino masses are below @xmath61 gev , respectively and should be observable at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "scenario a is related to the snowmass point sps1a",
    "@xcite by scaling the common scalar mass @xmath62 , the unified gaugino mass @xmath63 , and the common trilinear coupling @xmath64 by @xmath65 .",
    "thus the slope @xmath66 remains unchanged . for scenarios b and c , we also choose @xmath67 , however we change the slopes to @xmath68 in scenario b , and @xmath69 in scenario c. for all scenarios , we fix the ratio @xmath70 of the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral higgs fields . in table",
    "[ tab : scenarios ] , we explicitly give the relevant low energy msugra parameters for all scenarios .",
    "these are the @xmath71 and @xmath72 gaugino mass parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , and the higgsino mass parameter @xmath75 .",
    "the masses of the light neutralinos , charginos , and sleptons are given in table  [ tab : masses ] .",
    "all parameters and masses are calculated at one - loop order with the computer code spheno  @xcite .",
    "note that the lightest neutralino , @xmath76 , is mostly bino in all three scenarios ; @xmath77 in scenario a , @xmath78 in scenario b , and @xmath79 in scenario c. thus in our scenarios , radiative neutralino production proceeds mainly via right selectron exchange in the @xmath80 and @xmath81 channel . left selectron exchange and @xmath52 boson exchange are severely suppressed  @xcite .",
    "the background process @xmath82 mainly proceeds via @xmath83 boson exchange .",
    "thus positive electron beam polarization @xmath84 and negative positron beam polarization @xmath85 should enhance the signal rate and reduce the background at the same time  @xcite .",
    "this effect is clearly observed in figs .  [",

    "the background vary by more than one order of magnitude over the full polarization range .",

    "we have fixed @xmath86 .",
    "for completeness we have included the corresponding value of @xmath1 for each scenario . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for scenario a",
    ", we show the beam polarization dependence of the signal cross section @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma220 ] , and the dependence of the background cross section @xmath88 in fig .",

    ", we also give the values for the effective beam polarization @xmath94 which is a helpful quantity for discussing combined polarizations when the electron and the positron beam polarizations have the opposite sign .",
    "for example , a double beam polarization of @xmath95 and @xmath96 acts effectively as ( approximately ) @xmath97 of single beam polarization  @xcite .",
    "we find that an additional positron polarization @xmath98 enhances the significance @xmath55 by factors @xmath99 in scenarios @xmath100 , respectively , compared to beams with only @xmath101 polarization latexmath:[$(p_{e^+ }    scenarios @xmath100 , respectively , for @xmath103 compared to @xmath104 .",
    "the signal to background ratio @xmath56 is enhanced by @xmath105 for @xmath106 compared to @xmath107 and by @xmath108 for @xmath109 compared to @xmath110 .",
    "if the positron beams would be polarized by @xmath111 , the enhancement factors for @xmath55 are @xmath112 , and for @xmath56 they are @xmath113 . for @xmath114",
    ", it is only with positron polarization that we obtain values of @xmath56 clearly above 1% .",
    "if we have @xmath115 , then @xmath56 exceeds @xmath44 without positron beam polarization .",
    "since the neutralinos are mainly bino , the signal cross section also depends sensitively on the mass @xmath116 of the right selectron . in scenarios @xmath100 the masses",
    "are @xmath117  gev , respectively , see table  [ tab : masses ] . for larger masses , the signal to background ratio drops below @xmath118 . with @xmath119 ,",
    "this happens for @xmath120  gev , and the significance would be @xmath121 .",
    "these selectron masses correspond to the msugra parameter @xmath122  gev",
    ".      in anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) scenarios , the gaugino mass parameters are roughly related by @xmath123 at the weak scale  @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , the lightest neutralino is wino like , and left slepton exchange is enhanced in the reaction @xmath124 . therefore , it is no longer possible to increase the signal and to reduce the background simultaneously by a suitable choice of beam polarizations . in amsb scenarios , also @xmath125  gev",
    "is bounded from below  @xcite and rather large . for smaller @xmath126 ,",
    "either the lightest stau is the lsp or sleptons would already have been observed .",
    "the relatively heavy selectrons lead then to a suppression of the cross section for radiative neutralino production .",
    "for example in the scenario sps9  @xcite with @xmath127  gev and @xmath128  gev , @xmath129  gev , @xmath130  gev , calculated with spheno  @xcite , we find that the significance is @xmath131 and the signal to background ratio @xmath132 , for various values of the beam polarizations at @xmath133  gev . finally , in amsb scenarios the lightest neutralino @xmath13 is nearly mass degenerate with the lightest chargino @xmath134 .",
    "thus , if the radiative production of neutralinos is kinematically accessible , also the pair production of charginos @xmath135 can be well observed . in this context it is interesting to note that the radiative production of charginos @xmath136 might be important , if the charginos decay almost invisibly  @xcite .",
    "this could happen , if the neutralino - chargino mass difference is such , that the charginos decay into rather soft pions @xmath137 .",
    "the cross section of radiative neutralino production is also small in models , where the lightest neutralino is higgsino - like , _ i.e. _ @xmath138 .",
    "for example , for @xmath139  gev and @xmath140  gev we find @xmath131 and @xmath141  fb , since the gaugino couplings of the neutralino are suppressed .",
    "the couplings of the neutralino to the @xmath52-boson are proportional to the squared difference of the higgsino couplings , @xmath142 see ref .",
    "@xcite , and thus too small to lead to an observable signal .",
    "we have studied radiative neutralino production @xmath143 at the ilc with longitudinally polarized beams . for the center - of - mass energies",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , we have considered three specific msugra inspired scenarios . in our scenarios , only radiative neutralino production is kinematically accessible , since the other supersymmetric particles are too heavy to be pair produced . we have investigated the beam polarization dependence of the cross section from radiative neutralino production and the background form radiative neutrino production @xmath144 .",
    "we have shown that polarized beams enhance the signal and suppress the background simultaneously and significantly . in our scenarios ,",
    "the signal cross section for @xmath145 is larger than @xmath146 , the significance @xmath147 , and the signal to background ratio is about @xmath148 .",
    "the background cross section can be reduced to @xmath149 . increasing the positron beam polarization to @xmath150 , both the signal cross section and the significance increase by about @xmath151 , in our scenarios . for @xmath152",
    "the radiative neutralino production signature is observable at the ilc but both the significance and the signal to background ratio are considerable improved for @xmath153 , making more detailed investigations possible .",
    "the electron and positron beam polarization at the ilc are thus essential tools to observe radiative neutralino production . for unpolarized beams",
    "this process can not be measured .",
    "we conclude that radiative neutralino production can and should be studied at @xmath0 , as well as at the lower energies @xmath29 and @xmath154 , which are relevant for higgs and top physics .",
    "we have shown that for these energies there are scenarios , where other susy particles like heavier neutralinos , charginos and sleptons are too heavy to be pair produced . in any case , a pair of radiatively produced neutralinos is the lightest accessible state of susy particles to be produced at the linear collider .",
