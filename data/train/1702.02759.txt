    "in this work , we discuss the dynamics of an exciton in a quantum dot which interacts with a coherent state , supported by a cavity , under the action of a continuous laser , for controlling the cavity losses , and external gaussian laser pulses , to control exciton - cavity dynamics . our study is a step towards the implementation of an _ on - chip _ cavity quantum eletrodynamics .",
    "we define a qubit using two levels on the quantum dot so @xmath14 is the vacuum state ( no exciton ) and @xmath15 is the exciton state ( qd qubit ) .",
    "we use the population inversion , @xmath54 , a mixed vector definition of quantum dot qubit on poincar sphere to study the dynamics of the qubit and the von neumann entropy , to analyze its entanglement degree with the cavity mode ( closed system ) as well as its purity ( open system ) .",
    "the treatment without considering losses provides important information : by the average population is used to define an efficient condition of qubit - cavity and pulse - cavity detunings for populating the dressed states @xmath17 .",
    "the dynamics shows self - trapping on population inversion , among with oscillations of the relative phase of the qubit . by including the pulses",
    ", we check the effect of the pulse area on the dynamics showing that the central value of population inversion changes significantly after the pulse .",
    "the sequence of pulses can be also used to increase the entanglement degree between the qubit and the cavity in non - resonant ideal ( no losses ) condition .",
    "we also discuss the effect of losses on our approach . because the qd qubit lifetime is long enough ( and it can be even longer in a non - resonant condition with the cavity ) , we avoid the effects of spontaneous emission by choosing a short time scale defined by @xmath124 . the qd qubit dynamical control , on - demand ,",
    "is attained by using a sequence of short pulses . to protect the manipulation against cavity looses , we explore the use of an additional continuous laser , which maintains a steady coherent state inside the cavity .",
    "this mechanism already sustains the qd qubit dynamics assuring the success of our proposal .",
    "we also analyzed the effects of pure dephasing of the qd qubit in the dynamics , showing that it produces no effects in the time evolution during our short pulse sequence , but it might affect the preparation of the initial state .    as future works , we intend to continued studying the entanglement between the qd qubit and cavity by quantifying the existence of quantum correlations when considering losses .",
    "the goal is to explore the potential of this system as an entanglement resource .",
    "a second issue is to engage a study about production quantum light but focusing on other than single photons .",
