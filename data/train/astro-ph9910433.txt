    "the term  wind \" or hydrodynamic accretion refers to the capture of matter by a moving object under the effect of the underlying gravitational field .",
    "the canonical astrophysical scenario in which matter is accreted in such a non - spherical way was suggested originally by bondi and hoyle  @xcite , who studied , using newtonian gravity , the accretion on to a gravitating point mass moving with constant velocity through a non - relativistic gas of uniform density . such process applies to describe mass transfer and accretion in compact x - ray binaries , in particular in the case in which the donor ( giant ) star lies inside its roche lobe and loses mass via a stellar wind .",
    "this wind impacts on the orbiting compact star forming a bow - shaped shock front around it .",
    "the problem was first numerically investigated in the early 70 s . since then",
    ", contributions of a large number of authors using highly developed godunov - type methods extended the simplified analytic models ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references there in ) .",
    "these newtonian investigations helped develop a thorough understanding of the hydrodynamic accretion scenario , in its fully three - dimensional character , revealing the formation of accretion disks and the appearance of non - trivial phenomena such as shock waves or _ flip - flop _ instabilities .",
    "we have recently considered hydrodynamic accretion on to a moving black hole using relativistic gravity and the  test fluid \" approximation  @xcite .",
    "we present here a brief summary of the methodology and results of such simulations .",
    "we integrate the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations in the fixed background of the kerr spacetime ( including its non - rotating schwarzschild limit ) and neglect the self - gravity of the fluid as well as non - adiabatic processes such as viscosity or radiative transfer . in the black hole case",
    "the matter flows ultimately across the event horizon and becomes causally disconnected of distant observers . near that region",
    "the problem is intrinsically relativistic and the gravitational accelerations significantly deviate from the newtonian values .",
    "the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations can be cast as a first - order flux - conservative system describing the conservation of mass , momentum and energy .",
    "formulations of this sort are given , e.g. in  @xcite . in this work",
    "we follow the approach laid out in  @xcite for a perfect fluid stress - energy tensor @xmath0 .",
    "the system of equation then reads : @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ; @xmath3 spatial coordinates , @xmath4 ) where @xmath5 are the evolved quantities , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the fluxes @xmath8 @xmath9 being the 3-velocity and @xmath10 the pressure .",
    "the corresponding sources @xmath11 are given by @xmath12 we note the presence of geometric terms in the fluxes and sources which appear as the local conservation laws of the density current and stress - energy are expressed in terms of partial derivatives .",
    "these terms are the lapse function @xmath13 , the shift vector @xmath14 and the connection coefficients @xmath15 of the 3 + 1 spacetime metric @xmath16 additionally @xmath17 is such that @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the vector @xmath20 , representing the primitive variables , is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the density and @xmath23 the specific internal energy .",
    "the evolved quantities are defined in terms of the primitive variables as @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the lorentz factor @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , and @xmath30 the specific enthalpy , @xmath31 .",
    "a perfect fluid equation of state @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the constant adiabatic index , closes the system .    in our computations",
    "we specialize the above expressions to the kerr line element which describes the exterior geometry of a rotating black hole .",
    "we use the kerr - schild form of the kerr metric , which is free of coordinate singularities at the black hole horizon .",
    "computations using the more standard boyer - lindquist ( singular ) form of the metric are presented in  @xcite .",
    "pertinent technical details concerning the specific form of these metrics are given in  @xcite .",
    "our hydrodynamical code performs the numerical integration of system ( [ f ] ) using a godunov - type method . the time update from @xmath34 to @xmath35 proceeds according to the following algorithm in conservation form : @xmath36 improved with the use of ( second - order ) conservative runge - kutta sub - steps to gain accuracy in time  @xcite .",
    "the numerical fluxes are computed by means of marquina s flux - formula  @xcite .",
    "after the update of the conserved quantities the primitive variables are computed via a root - finding procedure .",
    "the flux - formula makes use of the complete characteristic information of system ( [ f ] ) , eigenvalues ( characteristic speeds ) and right and left eigenvectors .",
    "generic expressions are collected in  @xcite .",
    "the state variables , @xmath37 , must be computed ( reconstructed ) at the left and right sides of a given interface , out of the cell - centered quantities , prior to compute the numerical fluxes . in relativistic hydrodynamics",
    "one has the freedom to reconstruct either @xmath20 ( primitive variables ) or @xmath37 ( evolved variables ) . for efficiency and accuracy considerations",
    "we reconstruct the first set , from which the remaining variables are obtained algebraically .",
    "the code uses slope - limiter methods to construct second - order tvd schemes by means of monotonic piecewise linear reconstructions of the cell - centered quantities .",
    "we use the standard minmod slope which provides the desired second - order accuracy for smooth solutions , while still satisfying the tvd property .",
    "the classical solution for an asymptotically uniform wind of presureless gas past a compact source ( modeled analytically by a point mass ) was obtained by  @xcite . in this solution",
    "the material is focussed at the rear part of the object as a result of the gravitational pull . for a pressureless gas",
    ", the density at this symmetry line could reach an infinite value and matter would flow on to the hole along this accretion line .",
    "however , when pressure is included in the model , a cylindrical shock forms around this line and the accretion proceeds along an accretion column of high density and pressure shocked material .",
    "the predicted final accretion pattern consists of a stationary conical shock with the material inside the accretion radius being captured by the central object .",
    "an schematic representation of this solution is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "a numerical evolution of relativistic wind accretion past a rapidly - rotating kerr black hole ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 specific angular momentum , @xmath40 black hole mass ) is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "this simulation shows the steady - state pattern in the equatorial plane of the black hole .",
    "the tail shock appears stable to tangential oscillations , in contrast to newtonian simulations with tiny accretors ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references there in ; see  @xcite for a related discussion ) .",
    "the accretion rates of mass and linear and angular momentum also show a stationary behavior ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . as opposed to the non - rotating black hole , in the rotating case",
    "the shock becomes wrapped around the central accretor , the effect being more pronounced as the black hole angular momentum @xmath39 increases .",
    "the inner boundary of the domain is located at @xmath41 ( _ inside _ the event horizon which , for this model , is at @xmath42 ) which is only possible with the adopted regular coordinate system .",
    "the flow morphology shows smooth behavior when crossing the horizon , all matter fields being regular there .",
    "the enhancement of the pressure in the post - shock zone is responsible for the `` drag '' force experienced by the accretor .",
    "the rotating black hole redistributes the high pressure area , with non - trivial effects on the nature of the drag force .",
    "the pressure enhancement is predominantly on the counter - rotating side .",
    "we observe a pressure difference of almost two orders of magnitude , along the axis normal to the asymptotic flow direction .",
    "the implication of this asymmetry is that a rotating hole moving across the interstellar medium ( or accreting from a wind ) , will experience , on top of the drag force , a `` lift '' force , normal to its direction of motion ( to the wind direction ) .",
    "although different in origin this feature bears a superficial resemblance with the magnus effect of classical fluid dynamics .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows how the accretion pattern would look like were the computation performed using the more common ( though singular ) boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "the transformation induces a noticeable wrapping of the shock around the central hole .",
    "the shock would wrap infinitely many times before reaching the horizon . as a result",
    ", the computation in these coordinates would be much more challenging than in kerr - schild coordinates , particularly near the horizon .",
    "since the last stable orbit approaches closely the horizon in the case of maximal rotation , the interesting scenario of co - rotating extreme kerr accretion would be severely affected by the strong gradients which develop in the strong - field region .",
    "this will most certainly affect the accuracy and , potentially , also the stability of numerical codes ."
