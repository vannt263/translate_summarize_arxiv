    "quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of strong interactions , may have a critical point in the temperature ( t)-baryon number density ( or the baryonic chemical potential @xmath0 ) depending on the number of light flavors it has .",
    "the search for this critical point is one of the major experimental goals of many heavy ion collider experiments world wide .",
    "in particular , the star experiment at the brookhaven national laboratory has begun an extensive beam energy scan(bes ) program  @xcite .",
    "it aims to scan the qcd phase diagram for baryon chemical potential between 20 to around 400 mev , looking for the signatures of the presence of the critical point .",
    "fair at gsi , darmstadt , germany and nica at dubna , russia are proposed to be operational in future with a key objective as the search for and the study of , a qcd critical point .",
    "it , therefore , appears natural to have a first principles theoretical exploration of the qcd critical point , with a possible prediction for its location which could serve as a useful reference for these large scale experiments .",
    "the physics near the critical point is essentially non - perturbative .",
    "lattice gauge theory is the most successful non - perturbative tool which can be used for such an exercise .",
    "fluctuations of conserved charges like the baryon number or strangeness are sensitive indicators of the existence of singularities in the phase diagram like the critical point  @xcite . it is expected that the baryon number susceptibility would diverge at the critical point . on a finite lattice ,",
    "however , this quantity will show a peak at the critical point which would get sharper as the lattice volume is increased .",
    "the direct computation of the susceptibility at finite baryon density is difficult due to the infamous `` fermion sign problem '' .",
    "one of the techniques to circumvent the sign problem at finite density is to compute the baryon number susceptibility as a taylor series expansion in chemical potential near zero  @xcite .",
    "the radius of convergence of the series should yield an estimate of the location of the critical point  @xcite . for the precise estimation of the radius of convergence",
    ", one needs to compute ratios of as many higher orders of baryon number susceptibilities as possible .",
    "current state of the art is the eighth order susceptibility on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "higher order terms are important in determining the critical point , and extending to higher orders in taylor series is therefore desirable although the explosion in the cpu time required is severely constraining .",
    "there are two major issues that have to be addressed for the efficient computations of higher order quark number susceptibilities(qns ) .",
    "firstly , using the standard method of introducing chemical potential on the lattice  @xcite , the computation of qns beyond eighth order with reasonably good precision becomes rather expensive . at each order ,",
    "the fermion matrix inversions account for the maximum time involved in computing the qns .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , twenty inversions are necessary for computing the eighth order susceptibility ; it would increase to about forty for the tenth order . for computing higher orders of qns on the lattice , the number of matrix inversions would thus increase drastically thereby increasing the computation time .",
    "secondly the current estimates of the susceptibilities beyond fourth order on the lattice tend to become statistically demanding as they are rather noisy .",
    "this is due to the fact that there are delicate cancellations in the expressions of qns between different terms .",
    "moreover , the number of such terms itself increases progressively with the order of the susceptibility .",
    "each term has to be computed with appropriate precision in order to ensure the cancellation of is free of computational artifacts",
    ". it would be desirable to reduce the number of such cancellations .",
    "in this paper we attempt to address both these issues .",
    "we use a staggered fermion matrix in which the chemical potential , @xmath1 , enters as a lagrange multiplier , multiplying the point - split conserved number density term .",
    "it alleviates the problems mentioned above , as shown in  @xcite . for computing the eighth order qns ,",
    "only eight fermion matrix inversions would be needed  @xcite as compared to the twenty required in the conventional method  @xcite . in the early years of lattice computations",
    "this method of introducing @xmath1 linearly was discarded because the second order qns computed using this term leads to a @xmath2 lattice term that diverges in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing , @xmath3 .",
    "modifications of the lattice action  @xcite eliminated this term exactly for the free theory .",
    "in addition , they also ensured the correct fermi surface on the lattice .",
    "these modifications lead to the difficulties in computing the higher order qns though .",
    "it therefore appears a worthy attempt to focus back on the linear in @xmath1 action and devise ways to obtain physical answers .",
    "a method of successful elimination of the divergence maybe relevant in another context as well .",
    "the recently proposed overlap operator at finite density  @xcite with exact chiral symmetry on the lattice has such a linear dependence in @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the suggestions of  @xcite of divergence removal do not seem to work in that case .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ basic formalism ]",
    "we briefly review the basic formulae of the various susceptibilities and show the differences in the two methods . in section  [ results ]",
    "we suggest a procedure to remove the lattice artifacts in the qns computed with the linear term in @xmath1 .",
    "free fermion results are shown to yield the correct continuum limit with it .",
    "we then compare our results for full qcd with those in the standard exponential method  @xcite .",
    "we show that our results are consistent with the existing results for different orders of qns and the ratios of baryon number susceptibilities for a wide range of temperatures .",
    "a summary of our results along with possible sources of errors and their refinement is given in the last section .",
    "the quark number susceptibilities(qns ) for two flavor qcd are defined as , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the qcd partition function , @xmath6 @xmath7 is the action for the gluon fields .",
    "we use the standard plaquette action for @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 , for each @xmath9 , is the staggered fermion matrix in presence of finite quark chemical potentials .",
    "several choices of the dirac matrix are possible on the lattice at finite density . as in the continuum , the chemical potential can be introduced as a lagrange multiplier corresponding to the conserved number density on the lattice in the point split form .",

    "the radius of convergence of this series , should therefore determine the location of the critical point in the @xmath24-@xmath0 plane of the qcd phase diagram .",

    "it is clear from the above definitions of the radius of convergence that one needs to estimate more and more higher orders of the baryon number susceptibilities in order to locate it with precision and reliability .",

    "( [ eqn : defsusc ] ) can be written in terms of the trace of the derivatives of the dirac matrix in eq .",

    "( [ eqn : gko2 ] ) , one sees the absence of the second derivative term in the former .",
    "in fact , it arises due to those modifications which eliminate the free theory divergence .",
    "but then due to the same reasons eq .",
    "( [ eqn : gko4 ] ) has four additional terms of alternating sign as compared to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : uso2o4 ] ) .",
    "this is generic . as the order n increases , the number of such terms in the expression of the @xmath32 increases .",
    "it should be noted that each trace in the expressions of qns contains product of the inverse of the dirac operator with the derivatives of dirac operator with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "the matrix inversion is the most expensive computation on the lattice .",
    "if successive derivatives of dirac operator are all finite , one has to compute more number of matrix inversions . using the operator defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : diracop ] ) only the first derivative of the dirac operator is finite .",
    "thus the price of additional terms with sign changes increases at the higher orders .",
    "computationally , this implies more inverses of the matrix @xmath29 and more precision with each term has to be computed in order to get @xmath38 with comparable accuracy for all @xmath39 .",

    "can successfully remove the lattice artifacts that appear in the expressions of the lower order susceptibilities , then it can potentially open the door to compute the eighth and the higher derivatives with considerably less computational effort , enabling a better check on the radius of convergence estimate , as argued in  @xcite .",
    "in this section we first begin by computing the susceptibilities of free fermions using the staggered operator in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : diracop ] ) in order to separate the artifacts in the second and fourth order qns . in  @xcite we proposed to remove the undesired artifacts by estimating the zero temperature contribution on a symmetric lattice for each value of the gauge coupling , as is done for the pressure or energy density computation .",
    "this was motivated by the idea of keeping the cut - off effects to be the same as temporal lattice size increases . on the other hand , if one notes that the all the analytic methods of removal of the @xmath40-divergent terms were proven to be so only for the free theory , and that no new divergences appeared in the simulations of the interacting theory , one is lead to believe that a numerical method devised also for the free theory may work as well .",
    "furthermore , since no new renormalizations are necessary at finite @xmath24 and @xmath0 in perturbation theory , we expect the free theory artifacts to be the dominant ones . in this work",
    "we show that this method of subtraction gives results for all qns which are in good agreement with the existing results for @xmath41 . for @xmath42 ,",
    "this subtraction method appears to lead to some differences but these are small enough to be tolerated as differences in the finite parts of two schemes of removal of infinity . on finer lattices",
    "these will shrink , if this is indeed so . moreover , even for @xmath42 , we find that the crucial ratios of susceptibilities and therefore , the radius of convergence estimates are not sensitive to it .      the number density and the quark number susceptibilities(qns ) can be calculated analytically for the free fermions .",
    "we sketch how it is done , and discuss the results for number density for free fermions , obtained with the fermion matrix in eq .",

    "absence of canceling terms , and requirement of fewer dirac matrix inversions make the linear form more suited for extension to higher order non - linear susceptibilities needed to estimate the radius of convergence , or the location of the qcd critical point .    in this work we proposed a numerical scheme to remove the free theory artifacts inherent in the linear form . in particular , subtractions were introduced for the second and fourth order susceptibility which we suggest should be evaluated for the free theory at zero temperature but the same spatial volume . as one sees from our figs .",
    "( [ chi20],[chi4b ] ) , it works well .",
    "indeed , the main difference from the popular exponential form stem from the corresponding free theory due to the coarse finite spacing used at temperatures @xmath105 . for the practically more relevant ratios , such as those in the left panel of fig .",
    "( [ chiratio ] ) used as signature for critical point or in the right panel of fig .",
    "( [ chiratio ] ) , used for estimating the radius of convergence , our method works as well as the exponential form within errors .",
    "it would be interesting to extend this work to higher orders at the critical point , estimates of which are currently obtained with susceptibilities up to the eighth order .",
    "the computations were performed on the cray x1 of the indian lattice gauge theory initiative(ilgti ) at tifr , mumbai .",
