    "the study of the properties of the giant - dipole resonance ( gdr ) at finite intrinsic excitation energy has been the objective of many experimental programs during the past decade ( see the reviews in ref .",
    "these experiments yield important information regarding nuclear motion as a function of temperature .",
    "in particular , the role played by quantal and thermal fluctuations in the damping of the giant vibrations . in this connection , one can individualize the following central issues : ( 1 )  the temperature dependence of the intrinsic width  @xcite ; ( 2 )  the time scale for thermal fluctuations testing the validity of either the adiabatic picture  @xcite or the occurrence of motional narrowing  @xcite ; ( 3 )  the existence of a limiting temperature for the observation of collective motion in nuclei  @xcite ; and ( 4 ) the influence of the lifetime of the compound nucleus on the observed width of the gdr  @xcite . of particular importance to address these issues",
    "is a systematic and comprehensive comparison between experiment and theory over a wide range of temperatures for several nuclei .",
    "one of the principal experimental techniques for observing the gdr in hot nuclei has been compound - nuclear reactions induced in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . for the most part ,",
    "the wide range of experiments performed so far indicate that the full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the gdr strength function increases as a function of temperature as is predicted by theories for the gdr in hot nuclei that account for adiabatic , large - amplitude thermal fluctuations of the nuclear shape  @xcite .",
    "many of these experiments , however , involve slightly different compound systems and are often analyzed using different parameters  most notably the level - density parameter .",
    "in addition , because of the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions , the compound system is generally formed at high angular momentum . indeed , those systems corresponding to the highest excitation energy typically have the largest angular momentum content .",
    "as such , it is difficult to separate the effects due to large - amplitude thermal fluctuations of the shape from those due to angular momentum .",
    "recently , two experimental methods for studying the effects of excitation energy and angular momentum separately on the gdr have been introduced . in experiments involving compound nuclear reactions , large arrays of gamma detectors",
    "have been used in order to identify gdr photons associated with a system of definite angular momentum . with this experimental setup",
    ", the gdr may be studied within an angular momentum window that is usually of the order 10 - 15 units of angular momentum wide , and centered between 30 - 50  @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "an alternative technique is to excite a target nucleus by inelastic scattering with light particles  @xcite , which , because of the light mass of the projectile , yields an excited system with a fairly small angular momentum . by comparing data from these experiments with theoretical predictions , it is now possible to analyze the gdr in hot nuclei in terms of the effects due to thermal fluctuations and angular momentum separately .    in an earlier letter  @xcite",
    ", we presented the results of a systematic study of the fwhm for the giant - dipole resonance as a function of temperature , angular momentum , and intrinsic width for the nuclei @xmath0sn and @xmath1pb in comparison with recent experimental data from inelastic alpha scattering  @xcite . in this work , in addition to providing the details of how this study was carried out",
    ", we also expand upon that work by providing a prediction for the influence of the evaporation particles on the fwhm in @xmath1pb at finite temperature . because of the systematic analysis over a range of temperatures and the relatively low angular momentum of the emitting system , it is possible to draw conclusions regarding the separate roles played by shell corrections , angular momentum , and the lifetime of the compound nucleus on the observed width of the gdr .",
    "this work is organized in the following manner . in section",
    "ii , the formalism for calculating the effects of thermal fluctuations of the nuclear shape while projecting angular momentum is outlined .",
    "a model for the gdr utilizing a quantal , rotating harmonic oscillator is given in section iii .",
    "a description of the shell corrections to the free energy and moments of inertia is presented in section iv , while results and conclusions are given in sections v and vi , respectively .",
    "the description of the gdr in hot nuclei begins by noting that at a finite temperature , @xmath3 , large - amplitude thermal fluctuations of the nuclear shape play an important role in the observation of nuclear properties . under the assumption that the time scale associated with thermal fluctuations is slow compared to the shift in the dipole frequency caused by the fluctuations ( adiabatic motion ) , the gdr cross section consists of a weighted average over all shapes and orientations .",

    "this is illustrated in fig .  1 , where , in the lower panel , the free energy for @xmath25sn is plotted along the oblate noncollective and prolate collective axes at a temperature of 2  mev and a rotational frequency of 1.25  mev , which corresponds to an average angular momentum of approximately @xmath26 .",

    "these issues are discussed in further detail in ref .",
    "in principle , the most appropriate description of the gdr strength function in a hot , rotating nucleus would be obtained by performing random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations for each deformation and orientation . because of the large number of points required in performing the thermal averaging of eqs .",

    "due to the exponential dependence in eq .",
    "( [ e : avg_j ] ) , the most important ingredient for the calculation of the gdr strength function is the nuclear free energy . here",

    "@xcite , and @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the nilsson and strutinsky components comprising the shell correction , @xmath110 , to the free energy . in this work , the nilsson parameters were taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . for the most part",
    ", the shell corrections for @xmath0sn were found to be quite small ( a few hundred kev at @xmath1111.25  mev ) , and for all practical purposes can be ignored .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that the separate proton and neutron contributions are approximately equal in magnitude , but opposite in sign , and , hence , essentially cancel .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the strong coherence found in @xmath1pb , where , at low temperatures , strong shell corrections ( @xmath112  mev at @xmath113  mev ) are found that favor the spherical shape .",
    "we have also investigated the influence of the pairing interaction , and have found that effects due to pairing are significant only for temperatures below @xmath114  0.75  mev , which is a lower temperature than for which experiments have been performed .",
    "in addition , nilsson - strutinsky calculations that include pairing , indicate that , for the most part , the effects on the free energy are negligible .",
    "this is because @xmath1pb is a doubly closed - shell nucleus with pairing gaps equal to zero for the spherical shape , and in @xmath0sn , as was the case for the free energy without pairing disscussed above , the separate proton and neutron contributions tend to cancel , leading to a free energy whose deformation dependence is essentially that of the liquid drop .",
    "we note that a numerical determination of the effects of thermal fluctuations in eq .",
    "( [ e : avg_j ] ) in general requires an exploration of the five dimensional space spanned by the deformation and orientation degrees of freedom , in which a large number of points are required in order to assure sufficient accuracy ( especially at finite angular momentum ) . in this regard , a nilsson - strutinsky calculation for each point may be too time consuming .",
    "therefore , it is useful to parameterize the free energy using functions that mimic the behavior of the nilsson - strutinsky calculation as closely as possible .",
    "it has been pointed out  @xcite that , being a scalar quantity , the free energy must be a function of the rotational invariants of the quadrupole deformation , that is @xmath115 although this landau parameterization gives a good overall description of the free energy , in particular regarding to shape transitions , it may not be adequate for the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ e : avg_j ] ) because at somewhat larger deformations eq .",
    "( [ e : landau ] ) deviates from the nilsson - strutinsky calculation , often giving a much stiffer free energy .",
    "this is principally because eq .",
    "( [ e : landau ] ) attempts to combine both the liquid - drop free energy and shell corrections , @xmath116 , into the same parameterization .",
    "an alternative approach is to parameterize instead only the shell corrections to the free energy using a function of the rotational invariants .    exhibited in fig .",
    "2 ( solid points ) are shell corrections to the free energy at @xmath117 as a function of temperature for oblate ( @xmath118 ) , prolate ( @xmath119 ) , and triaxial ( @xmath120 ) deformations for @xmath1pb .",
    "the general overall behavior of @xmath110 is to decrease with temperature , gradually melting ( @xmath121  mev ) for temperatures of the order @xmath122  mev , and that they tend to oscillate with deformation , but appearing to be damped at larger @xmath9 . in this light , it is possible to parameterize @xmath110 with a series of functions that are in fact themselves functions of the rotational invariants @xmath123 , @xmath124 , etc ... one possible parameterization is @xmath125 where the @xmath126 are spherical bessel functions .",
    "we note that @xmath127 is the expected attenuation behavior as a function temperature when the single - particle hamiltonian is a degenerate harmonic oscillator  @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 can be determined in the following manner .",
    "first , carry out a nilsson - strutinsky calculation for oblate , prolate and triaxial shapes up to @xmath131 , and for temperatures between @xmath132 and 3.0  mev .",
    "then fit both parameters @xmath128 and @xmath129 to the nilsson - strutinsky calculation at @xmath132  mev for all three shapes simultaneously .",
    "note that at @xmath133 , the free energy is completely determined by @xmath134 , and as such is not fit upon .",
    "in addition , note that the @xmath120 points are dependent only on the even functions in eq .",

    "( [ e : free_bess ] ) can be truncated to @xmath135 . with the parameters @xmath129 determined at @xmath132  mev , these same values",
    "are then used to fit the @xmath128 values at all other temperatures , giving the sequence @xmath136 , which is then fit to the function @xmath137 . shown in fig .",

    "( [ e : free_bess ] ) gives a good overall reproduction of the shell corrections , @xmath110 , that is rather quick to implement with eq .",
    "( [ e : avg_j ] ) .",
    "we note one feature of the parameterization for @xmath1pb is that the parameterized shell corrections tend to `` melt '' a little too quickly .",
    "for example , for @xmath138  mev the parameterized shell corrections underestimate the nilsson - strutinsky values by a few hundred kev .",
    "it is to be noted , however , that at these temperatures , this amounts to a relatively small change in the overall deformation dependence of the total free energy , which , in addition to be divided by the temperature in the boltzman factor , @xmath139 is at basically dominated by the liquid - drop component .",
    "in addition to the free energy , shell structure can also modify the moments of inertia .",
    "again , we employ the nilsson - strutinsky procedure at finite rotational frequency , and obtain shell corrections to the rigid - body moments of inertia , namely @xmath140 where here the rigid - body values were evaluated with the radius @xmath141 . choosing the rotational frequency along the @xmath55-axis , the leading behavior as a function of rotational frequency for each of the free energy components in eq .",
    "( [ e : ns ] ) is given by @xmath142 the moments of inertia @xmath143 can then be obtained by performing a quadratic fit to the free energy components .    in a manner similar to the shell corrections to the free energies , the shell corrections to the moments of inertia",
    "may also be parameterized by series of bessel functions , i.e. , @xmath144 where the third term in the sum is included because of rotational invariance arguments for the moment of inertia  @xcite .",
    "once the third component of the moment of inertia is determined as a function of @xmath145 , the remaining two components are obtained by the relations  @xcite @xmath146    the parameters @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 were determined in a similar manner as those for the free energy in eq .",

    "are shown in fig .  3 as a function of temperature and for the deformations @xmath153 .",
    "the most important feature is the strong shell corrections at @xmath133 that significantly reduced the moment inertia below the rigid - body value .    of particular importantance for the moments of inertia",
    "is the fact that the spin - orbit and @xmath154 terms in the nilsson hamiltonian lead to moments of inertia that are approximately 20 - 30% larger than the corresponding rigid - body values  @xcite . as such ,",
    "the shell corrections to the moments of inertia used here were reduced by 25% , which corresponds to the average difference between the rigid - body and strutinsky moments of inertia .",

    "( [ e : avg_j ] ) , it might be expected that the strong shell corrections to the moment of inertia in @xmath1pb would significantly affect the gdr strength function , as they appear to give a stronger preference to the spherical shape .",
    "we find , however , that because of the @xmath156 factor in @xmath7 $ ] , the strong shell corrections in @xmath157 favoring the spherical shape have very little effect on the fwhm of the gdr at low spin beyond that produced by the free energy .",
    "this is exhibited in fig .  4 , where an `` effective '' weight factor ( which for the sake of simplicity ignores the @xmath158 factor ) @xmath159 is plotted for oblate and prolate shapes at @xmath160  mev for various combinations of the shell corrections . in the top panel of the figure ,",
    "the weight factor is plotted including shell corrections to the free energy as well as with and without shell corrections to the moments of inertia , whereas the corresponding figure without shell corrections to the free energy is shown in the bottom part of the figure . in both cases",

    "the fwhm in @xmath1pb appears to be suppressed at lower temperatures relative to @xmath0sn .",
    "this is due to the rather strong shell corrections in @xmath1pb that favor the spherical shape at low temperatures .",
    "the affect of such strong shell corrections is to limit the influence of thermal fluctuations at low temperatures , thereby reducing the observed width .",
    "this is also illustrated in fig .  5 , where the dotted line in the panel for @xmath1pb indicates the fwhm assuming no shell corrections .",
    "we note that the shell correction effect and the angular momentum dependence was also observed for @xmath174ce in ref .",
    "the fact that the adiabatic model slightly overestimates the fwhm maybe due to : ( 1 ) uncertainties in the extracted temperature ; ( 2 ) the shell corrections being more persistent at higher temperatures than predicted by nilsson - strutinsky calculations ; ( 3 ) the fact that the experimental strength functions were fit to a single lorentzian , while theoretically they are obtained from the superposition of many lorentzians ; and/or ( 4 ) the presence of non - adiabatic effects that would lead to a motional narrowing of the fwhm  @xcite . in keeping with point ( 1 ) above , one can mention that the temperatures inferred from experiment are sensitive to the choice of the level - density parameter , and , as a consequence , are uncertain at the level of approximately 0.2  mev .",

    "5 are essentially consistent with the adiabatic picture for the gdr in hot nuclei , and do not present any evidence for the phenomenon known as motional narrowing  @xcite , which tends to lessen the effects of thermal broadening on the resonance , and , hence , reduce the fwhm . as is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , because of a lack of reliable theoretical estimates for the time scales associated with thermal fluctuations , the fwhm is not sufficient in of itself to exclude motional narrowing .",
    "this is particularly true when the time scales for @xmath9 and @xmath10 degrees of freedom are much faster than those associated with the orientation of the system . in this case , both the response function and the angular distribution @xmath32 coefficient are needed in order to make a differentiation between the two regimes .",
    "we note some slight discrepancies between the adiabatic model and experiment for @xmath0sn . to begin with ,",
    "the fwhm at @xmath175  mev is significantly lower than the theoretical prediction and is difficult to explain within the framework of the model .",
    "this datum seems to point to the existence of strong shell corrections that quickly disappear at @xmath176  mev , which is in disagreement with the expectations of the nilsson - strutinsky procedure . at higher temperatures , @xmath177  mev ,",
    "the experimental fwhm is somewhat larger than the theoretical values , and may indicate a systematic trend to be observed at still higher temperatures .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "7 is the fwhm for @xmath0sn at @xmath178  mev as a function of the intrinsic width @xmath164 . at this temperature ,",
    "the experimental fwhm is @xmath179  mev , and we may infer from this datum a value of @xmath180  mev , as indicated by the solid square ( 11.5  mev ) and open circles ( @xmath181  mev ) in fig .  7 .",
    "we note , however , that this is consistent with the concept that the width observed for the gdr in hot nuclei should be increased because of the evaporation of particles from the compound nucleus  @xcite . at higher excitation energies , the decay rate for particle evaporation increases , and , because of the uncertainty principle , the energy of an emitted gdr photon can not be known with a precision better than @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the width for particle evaporation _ before _ and _ after _ the emission of the gdr photon . to account for this effect in our calculations",
    ", we note that the fwhm shown in fig .  5 are obtained from the full response function , which also includes splittings due to the superposition of the various intrinsic modes . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath184 represents an uncertainty in the gdr photon energy due to the lifetime of the initial and final states . as such",
    ", @xmath184 should be folded into the gdr response function by increasing the intrinsic widths via @xmath185 . in order to estimate @xmath184 for @xmath0sn",
    "we refer to fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath186 is plotted as a function of excitation energy for various values of the level - density parameter @xmath187 ( which is conventionally defined as @xmath188  mev@xmath189 , and values of @xmath186 are plotted for @xmath190 ,  10 , and 12 ) .",
    "we note that at a given excitation energy , @xmath186 exhibits a strong dependence on @xmath187 .",
    "indeed , at @xmath191  mev , there is a nearly a factor of three difference between the results for @xmath190 and 12 .",
    "this rather strong dependence on @xmath187 is considerably diminished , however , when converting to temperature , defined as @xmath192 , as is shown in table iii where @xmath183 and @xmath184 are given as a function of temperature for @xmath193 and 12 . only at the highest temperatures ( @xmath194  mev ) , where @xmath195 is expected to be of the order 12 - 13 , is the difference much greater than a few hundred kev .",
    "taking @xmath196 , we deduce at @xmath197  mev @xmath198  mev , which is in good agreement with the experimental results as is illustrated in fig .  7",
    "to further see the influence of the evaporation width , we have computed the fwhm for @xmath0sn a function of temperature including @xmath184 ( evaluated with @xmath196 ) , which is shown in fig .  5 by the dashed line . on the whole",
    ", the inclusion of @xmath184 leads to a better overall agreement with experiment .",
    "it is to be noted that although the experimental data for @xmath1pb do not , as yet , extend to @xmath199  mev , the effects of the particle evaporation width will also be present in @xmath1pb .",
    "we have computed @xmath186 for @xmath1pb using the same method as in ref .",
    "@xcite and is displayed in fig .",
    "8 as a function of excitation energy for @xmath190 ,  10 , and 12 . also shown in table iv",
    "are values of @xmath183 and @xmath184 as a function of temperature for @xmath193 and 12 .",
    "the fwhm for @xmath1pb including @xmath184 ( with @xmath196 ) is shown in fig .",
    "5 with the dashed line , where it is seen that at @xmath200  mev the fwhm is approximately 2.5  mev larger than predicted by the adiabatic model . as such , experiments carried out in this temperature range",
    "would be a further confirmation of this effect . finally , as is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the particle evaporation width also leads to a maximum excitation energy ( or limiting temperature ) above which the gdr is not observable .",
    "this occurs when @xmath201 , which for @xmath1pb corresponds to @xmath202  mev ( or @xmath203  mev ) .",
    "we conclude that a systematic study of the fwhm of the gdr as a function of temperature for the nuclei @xmath0sn and @xmath1pb confirms , for the first time , the overall theoretical picture of the gdr in hot nuclei at low spin . in particular , the role played by adiabatic , large - amplitude thermal fluctuations of the nuclear shape . in fact , overall agreement between theory and experiment is observed over a range of temperatures for both @xmath0sn and @xmath1pb , which display quite different behaviors for the fwhm as a function of temperature .",
    "this difference can be attributed to the presence of strong shell corrections favoring spherical shapes in @xmath1pb that are absent in @xmath0sn .",
    "finally , the increase in the fwhm over that expected from thermal averaging at temperatures of the order 3.0  mev is in accordance with the increase expected from the particle evaporation of the compound system .            p.f .",
