    "ultracompact ( uc ) hii regions are currently the best known tracer of massive ysos and represent the earliest confirmed stage of massive star formation . in excess of 150 uc hii regions have been detected , mainly by radio surveys . whilst the environments of uc hii regions are known very well on the small scale ( a few arcseconds )",
    "they are not well known on scales over 40 .",
    "this is because most uc hiis have , to date , been observed using either interferometers ( to gain information on small scales at the expense of large scales ) or by single - position large - beam ( typically 40  or worse ) spectroscopy . to redress this issue we recently undertook an imaging survey of over 100 uc hii regions using scuba on the jcmt , which enables us to rapidly map ( with high resolution ) the dust emission from the clumps in which the uc hiis are embedded",
    "scuba is mainly comprised of two bolometer arrays which ( almost ) instantaneously sample a 2  field simultaneously at 450 and 850 @xmath0 m .",
    "the instrument is very sensitive , with the results that we were able to image each uc hii down to a 1@xmath1 noise level of typically 50 mjy at 850 @xmath0 m in only 3 minutes .",
    "our source sample was drawn from the uc hii region catalogues of wood & churchwell ( 1989 ) and kurtz , churchwell & wood ( 1994 ) , comprising some 140 uc hii regions in all .",
    "our motivations for the survey were to _",
    "i ) _ investigate the large - scale structure of the dust clumps embedding the uc hiis ; _ ii ) _ fill the existing gap in the spectral energy distribution at sub - mm wavelengths ; _ iii ) _ search for other unknown dust clumps in the field of view , possibly harbouring massive ysos or protostars in different evolutionary states and _ iv ) _ identify hot molecular cores via their strongly peaked sub - mm emission ( hatchell et al .",
    "in total we observed 106 out of the 140 uc hii regions in the catalogues .",
    "sub - mm emission was detected in 80@xmath2 of the sample .",
    "the morphology of the dust clumps is surprisingly linear : over half of the singly - peaked clumps are elongated along one axis ( e.g.  g10.84 in fig .  1 ) and over half of multiply - peaked clumps take the form of cores string along a ridge ( e.g.  g23.96 in fig .  1 )",
    "we also identified a large number of previously unknown dust clumps in the field of view , many of which are not associated with radio continuum or embedded ir sources and may contain massive protostars in an earlier stage to that of the uc hii ( see gibb et al .",
    ", this proceedings for details of bima follow - up observations ) .",
    "in addition we identified 15 uc hiis associated with strongly peaked sub - mm continuum which may contain hot molecular cores ."
