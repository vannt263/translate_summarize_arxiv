    "is detected toward gy  263 , located 6@xmath4 northwest of vla  1 and vla  2 .    in order to derive the spectral index of vla  1 and vla  2",
    ", we first generate 3.6  cm maps using imagr and applying a gaussian taper to the visibility data to obtain a synthesized beam similar to the 6  cm maps .",

    "table  [ tspi ] gives the flux densities of the convolved maps and their spectral indices for the two epochs .",
    "the overall radio continuum emission of the ylw  15 region ( obtained by measuring the flux within a box that included vla  1 , vla  2 and the weak extended emission ) has an spectral index of 0.5@xmath300.1 and does not show signs of flux variability at roughly a 5% level .",
    "vla  1 and vla  2 have both positive spectral indices , @xmath20.5 and @xmath20.7 , respectively . because both sources have emission arising from a few tens of au , their emission is likely optically partially thick free - free .",
    "figure  [ fspi ] shows the slices of the vla  1 emission and spectral indices along its major axis for the 2000 and 2002 epoch .",
    "both epochs show that vla  1 has a spectral index at the peak of @xmath31 .",
    "interestingly , the southwestern weak lobe had in epoch 2000 a spectral index of @xmath32 , indicating non - thermal emission , while in the 2002 epoch its spectral index raised enough to be compatible with optically thin free - free emission ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "no sources were detected from the two epochs of vlba observations with an upper limit of about 0.3  mjy  beam@xmath10  ( 4-@xmath24 level ) .",
    "the parallax due to the earth orbiting the sun for @xmath1 ophiuchi is about 8.3 mas .",
    "ylw  15 has moved 5.4 and -1.4  mas in right ascension and declination , respectively , between the two vlba observations due to the parallax . taking also into account the spatial displacement due to the absolute proper motions of vla  2 measured in paper ii ,",
    "the total displacement of vla  2 is 3.0 and -9.4  mas in right ascension and declination , respectively .",
    "the visibility data of the first epoch was corrected for this shift .",
    "the maps of the combined visibility data were obtained using natural weighting , which yields an rms noise of 52  @xmath12jy .",
    "no emission was detected down to 0.21  mjy  beam@xmath10  ( 4-@xmath24 level ) .",
    "the same process was done taking into account the parallax and the vla  1 absolute proper motion .",
    "no emission was detected either .",
    "this upper limit implies that at least an 84% and 64% of the radio emission of vla  1 and vla  2 , respectively , arise from scales @xmath34  au , which is in agreement with the vla results that indicate that vla 1 and vla 2 are being partially resolved at scales of about 20  au .",
    "the left and right panels of figure  [ fsubaru ] show the image of ylw  15 and the standard hd  14  5897 , respectively , at 8.8  @xmath12 m obtained with the comics camera of subaru .",
    "the two sources in ylw  15 are well separated in the image , with vla  2 being significantly stronger than vla  1 .",
    "the separation between vla  1 and vla  2 is about @xmath35 with a pa of @xmath36 , which is in agreement with the values obtained from the vla observations ( see table 3 from paper ii ) .",
    "there is extended emission observed up to a @xmath37% level with respect to the peak value of the image around the two sources .",
    "it is clear from the hd  14  5897 image that there is also an extended  halo  at a level of 14% level due to the psf of the subaru telescope .",
    "therefore the extended emission up to a @xmath37% level in the ylw  15 image is possibly due to the subaru psf . in order to confirm this possibility , we deconvolved the ylw  15 image using as a psf model the hd  14  5897 image masked for levels below 2% ( in order to avoid the noise to contribute into the deconvolution ) .",
    "three different procedures were used for the deconvolution : the lucy algorithm from the stsdas package of iraf , maximum entropy and clean , these two from the miriad package .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fdcnv ] shows the resulting image of the maximum entropy deconvolution : the extended emission has disappeared down to a 2% level ( a similar result is also obtained with the lucy and clean algorithms ) .",
    "thus , it is clear that the extended halo around ylw  15 observed in the original image was due to the subaru psf .    in order to check",
    "if vla 1 and vla 2 are resolved at 8.8  @xmath12 m we computed the radial profile of the annular averaged normalized flux of hd  14  5897 , vla  2 and vla  1 ( see the right panel of figure  [ fdcnv ] ) .",
    "the half - width half - maximum ( hwhm ) of these profiles are @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 for hd  14  5897 , vla  2 and vla  1 , respectively .",
    "hd  14  5897 should be unresolved ( its size is @xmath41  mas : cohen et al .",
    ". the slightly higher width of hd  14  5897 with respect to vla  2 could be due to a slightly higher seeing during the hd  14  5897 observations ( taken 30 minutes after ylw  15 ) .",
    "in any case , the profile of vla  2 likely suggests that it is unresolved ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "assuming , that vla  2 is unresolved , and that it traces the psf , then the deconvolved hwhm of vla  1 can be estimated from the observed hwhm of these two sources : @xmath43 .",
    "there are two sources of uncertainties in this estimation .",
    "first , the intrinsic uncertainty due to the angular resolution and the snr of the source : @xmath44 ( condon 1997 ) . since the snr for vla  1 is @xmath45 and the angular resolution is @xmath46 , the uncertainty is @xmath47 .",
    "second , the difference in the measured size of the reference star and vla 2 can also be accounted as source of uncertainty : @xmath48 .",
    "the total uncertainty is @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the fwhm size for vla  1 of @xmath50 or @xmath51  au . finally , we note that despite the aforementioned deconvolution algorithms are not being very reliable to derive the ylw  15 sizes because of the small difference in size between vla  2 and hd  14  5897 , all of them produce an unresolved deconvolved object for vla  2 ( assuming that hd  14  5897 is a point source ) , whereas for vla  1 they produce a resolved object with a fwhm size of @xmath52@xmath53 , in agreement with the previous radial profile analysis .",
    "the slightly resolved vla  1 mid - ir emission possibly traces matter in a non - disk 3-d distribution ( i.e. ,  from the envelope ) which is falling onto ( or perhaps is being flung off of ) its circumstellar disk ( e.g. chick , pollack , & cassen 1996 ; adams , lada , & shu 1987 ) .",
    "yet , for low inclination angles ( nearly face - on ) the circumstellar disk emission could also contribute to the mid - ir emission ( osorio et al .",
    "2003 ; osorio : private communication ) .",
    "indeed , co outflow observations suggest that ylw  15 is nearly face - on ( bontemps et al.1996 ) .",
    "if this mid - ir emission comes partially from a circumstellar disk , then , it will trace only the inner - region of the disk which is warm enough to radiate in these wavelengths .",
    "since the infalling envelope also contributes to the mid - ir emission , the size of the mid - ir emission does not correspond with the disk size directly .",
    "however , due to tidal truncation from the companion star ( located at 72  au in projection ) its true size is probably not much larger ( e.g. ,  rodrguez  et al .",
    "1998 ; loinard et al .",
    "2002 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the mid - ir emission of vla  2 , unresolved , arises from a significantly smaller circumstellar structure .",
    "ylw  15 is detected in the 2mass all sky survey in the j and k bands , and is cataloged as 2mass  1627269 - 244050 .",
    "the 2mass ( second incremental release ) point source catalog coordinates are given in table  [ tcomp ] .",
    "these near - ir data were obtained on 1998 july 9 ( 1998.52 ) . in order to properly compare the positions of 2mass  1627269 - 244050 with vla  1 and vla  2 , we corrected the positions of these two radio sources to the values expected for the 1998.52 epoch taking into account the proper motions measured in paper ii .",
    "the difference between the positions of vla  1 and vla  2 for the 1998.52 epoch with respect to the 2mass position are given in table  [ tcomp ] . from this table",
    "it is clear that the near - ir source is associated with vla  2 , as suggested by greene & lada ( 2002 ) .",
    "similarly , we compared the positions of the two vla sources from the 2000 observations with the position of the x - ray source obtained with the chandra satellite in 2000 ( imanishi , koyama & tsuboi 2001 ; imanishi , private communication ) . given the positions uncertainties , the x - ray emission is more likely associated with vla  2 .    high angular resolution , near - ir , observations with hst / nicmos ( allen et al.2002 ) and using lunar occultation techniques ( simon et al .  1995 ) show that ylw  15 has a companion 6@xmath4 to the nw ( 720  au ) : gy  263 .",
    "yet ylw  15 appears to be a single object at scales down to @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , given the clear association of vla  2 with the 2mass  1627269 - 244050 source , vla  2 is the only significant source of emission at near - ir wavelengths . based on the near - ir spectroscopy , vla  2 is a k5 iv / v yso of 0.5  @xmath3  ( greene & lada 2002 ) .",
    "the mid - ir images at 8.8  @xmath12 m from comics with subaru ( this paper ) and at 10.8  @xmath12 m ( haisch et al .  2002 ) show two sources that correspond to vla  1 and vla  2 . at these two wavelengths ,",
    "vla  2 is stronger than vla  1 , which suggests that vla  1 is an embedded object or , alternatively , is less luminous ( see   [ edat ] ) .",
    "this source is located 78@xmath4 north of ylw  15 , so it is far from the phase center of the vla observations , but still within the primary beam of the 3.6 and 6  cm maps .",
    "this source was only detected in the 2002 epoch . because this source is weak , in order to achieve a better snr , the maps presented here were obtained using robust weighting of 0 and 1 at 3.6 and 6  cm , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fmapb ] shows the 3.6  cm and 6  cm maps for ylw  16a .",
    "the 3.6  cm image shows that the emission is elongated to the west of the intensity peak .",
    "because of the low snr , it is not clear whether this elongation is due to a one side jet lobe ( as it happens in ylw  15 vla  1 ) or if it is due to a binary radio source separated by @xmath55 .",
    "because bandwidth smearing is important for ylw  16a at 3.6  cm ( @xmath56 in the north - south direction ) , only the integrated flux density was measured , using a box that included all the emission .",
    "thus , the primary beam corrected flux density of ylw  16a is 0.43@xmath300.04 and 0.27@xmath300.05  mjy at 3.6 and 6  cm , respectively .",
    "these values imply an spectral index of the overall emission of 0.8@xmath300.4 , suggesting a thermal radio jet origin .",
    "allen et al .  ( 2002 ) detected with the hst / nicmos3 camera two near - ir sources with their components separated by @xmath56 in the east - west direction .",
    "however , allen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggested that this apparent binary system is possibly tracing scattered light from the disk of a single yso .",
    "in addition , lunar occultation observations by simon et al .",
    "( 1995 ) failed to detect a binary system . to compare the position of the near - ir and vla emission",
    ", we used the position given by the 2mass point source catalog ( source 2mass 1627280 - 243933 ) . correcting the vla position for proper motions ( as we did in   [ counter ] ) , the difference between the vla and near - ir emission , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , implies that both wavelength trace the same source .",
    "the chandra x - ray source n. 57 ( imanishi , private communication ) also coincides within its position uncertainty ( @xmath56 ) with the vla peak emission .",
    "the jet - like morphology of vla  1 ( including its weak southwestern lobe ) and its spectral index at centimeter wavelengths , @xmath31 , suggests that this source is a thermal radio jet ( e.g. ,  anglada 1996 ; rodrguez  1997 ) .",
    "vla  2 has a slightly higher spectral index , @xmath59 , and it is also partially resolved at similar scales as vla  1 . yet , it does not have a clear elongation direction ( see table  [ tflux ] ) .",
    "since vla  1 and vla  2 are very young stellar objects ( see   [ edat ] ) and that a significant fraction of their radio emission arises at scales of @xmath60  au (   [ vla ] ) , we can assume that their 3.6 and 6  cm emission arises from collimated , ionized winds .",
    "the radio emission of these winds was modeled by reynolds ( 1986 ) , which predicts that for a wind with constant velocity , temperature and ionization , a lower spectral index implies that the collimation of the jet increases with distance to the exciting star .",
    "thus the radio continuum properties of the ylw  15 radio sources ( vla  1 has a lower spectral index and has a more clear jet - like morphology than vla  2 ) are in agreement with the expected properties of collimated ionized winds .",
    "the higher 3.6  cm flux of vla  1 with respect to vla  2 implies that the momentum rate of the outflow material is higher in vla  1 than in vla  2 . from the correlation between the molecular outflow momentum rate and the flux of the free - free emission estimated by anglada et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the momentum rate expected for the molecular outflow powered by vla  1 and vla  2 should be 5@xmath6110@xmath62 and 2@xmath6110@xmath62  @xmath3  yr@xmath10  km  s@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the lack of emission for gy  263 gives an upper limit for the momentum rate of 1@xmath6110@xmath63  @xmath3  yr@xmath10  km  s@xmath10 , more than an order of magnitude lower than that of vla  2 .",
    "this suggests that gy  263 is a more evolved yso .",
    "indeed , the near - ir to mid - ir spectral index of gy  263 is consistent with a class ii yso ( haisch et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "vlba observations do not detect any compact emission in ylw  15 down to @xmath64  mjy  beam@xmath10 .",
    "since vla  2 is associated with x - ray emission , it is expected to have milliarcsecond radio emission . yet , the partially extended subarcsecond free - free emission associated with vla  2 will significantly mask emission at milliarcsecond scales : the observed angular sizes at 6  cm suggest that the radio `` photosphere '' has dimensions @xmath6510 au .",
    "any emission processes taking place at 6  cm inside this photosphere will suffer from significant free - free absorption and will be very difficult to detect . in order to avoid the absorption of the extended free - free emission , and thus to be more sensitive to milliarcsecond emission ,",
    "vlba observations would be best done at 2  cm ( where the radio photosphere will be about two times smaller and the optical depth will also be smaller ) or at shorter wavelengths .      greene & lada ( 2002 ) and haisch et al .",
    "( 2002 ) argue that vla  1 and its mid - ir counterpart is not a true star but instead has an outflow origin ( i.e. ,  it could be an hh knot ) .",
    "however , the vla proper motions measured in vla  1 and vla  2 ( paper ii ) clearly shows that these two sources are gravitationally bounded , with vla 1 being more massive .",
    "therefore , it is clear that vla  1 is a yso .",
    "the properties of vla  1 and vla  2 can be derived from the near - ir through far - ir properties of ylw  15 available in the literature .",
    "figure  [ fsed ] shows the @xmath66 ",
    "@xmath67 plot for those observations in the near to mid - ir range with enough angular resolution to resolve spatially vla  1 and vla  2 ( allen et al.2002 ; haisch et al .",
    "it is clear from this plot that the luminosity in the near to mid - ir is clearly dominated by vla  2 .",
    "the dashed line shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of vla  2 scaled down , so the 10.8  @xmath12 m flux coincides with the vla  1 flux at this wavelength .",
    "the 1.6 ( allen et al .  2002 ) and 2.2  @xmath12 m ( haisch et al .  2002 ) observations have enough angular resolution to resolve the binary system , but only vla  2 is detected .",
    "the presence of significant scattered light around ylw  15 does not allow to obtain useful upper limits for vla  1 ( the 2.2  @xmath12 m upper limit for vla  1 is only 0.2  mag higher than the vla  2 magnitude , haisch , private communication ) .",
    "in other words , all what we can say is that in the near to mid - ir wavelengths vla  1 is less luminous than vla  2 .",
    "the observed near - ir properties show that vla  2 is a class i yso ( haisch et al .",
    "2002 ; greene & lada 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , the overall properties of ylw  15 from the far - ir through the mm wavelengths ( see   [ intro ] ) show they also are in agreement with those found in class i objects . yet , which is the evolutionary state of vla  1 ? taking into account the near - to - mid ir sed ( fig .  [ fsed ] ) , there are two possible scenarios for vla  1 : it is more embedded than vla  2 ( i.e. , with a steeper sed ) , or , alternatively , vla  1 has a similar sed but a lower bolometric luminosity than vla  2 . for this later scenario ,",
    "the upper limit of the vla  1 stellar luminosity would be 3  @xmath68  ( the value for vla  2 : greene & lada 2002 ) . in the first scenario ,",
    "since the overall properties of ylw  15 are in agreement with those of class i sources , vla  1 can not be much more embedded than vla  2 ( i.e. ,  a class 0 object ) .",
    "we suggest that vla  1 is a very embedded yso in the class 0 to class i transition , as it may also be l1448  irs3(a ) ( ciardi et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "vla  1 probably dominates the millimeter dust emission and has a stronger outflow . indeed , vla  1 is the powering source of a hh system ( grosso et al .",
    "2001 ) and its radio centimeter emission is stronger than in vla  2 . we speculate that being ylw  15 a binary young stellar system , the dynamical perturbation of the two yso could diminish the circumstellar mass with respect to the expected values for isolated stars .",
    "in fact , the more evolved , class ii , t tauri close binary stars ( with separations in the 1 - 100  au range ) have less millimeter emission than single t tauri stars ( jensen , mathieu & fuller 1996 ) .    a conclusive test of which of the two sources is more luminous and which is the evolutionary status of vla  1 as well as its dust properties will come from high angular resolution observations in the mm and sub - mm , as those that will be achieved in the future by the sma , carma and alma , and at other wavelengths in the near to mid - ir range .",
    "the most striking feature of the ylw  15 binary system is that vla  1 appears to be a more massive and more embedded ( thereby less evolved ) or , alternatively , less luminous yso than vla  2 .",
    "interestingly , this result is apparently against the expected evolutionary scenario , where one expects that the more massive yso in a binary system is the more evolved and luminous yso .",
    "simulations of the evolution of binary ysos with circumstellar and circumbinary disks show that if one of the two yso is less massive , the dynamical effects of the system can cause a larger accretion rate to the less massive star ( that is expected to evolve more slowly ) , which will tend to equalize the masses ( lubow & artymowicz 2000 ) .",
    "but , this still does not explain that the more massive is apparently less evolved or less luminous .",
    "a plausible explanation is that the less massive component may indeed be more luminous because of its higher accretion rate , since ( accretion ) luminosity is proportional to accretion rate times stellar mass .",
    "gy  263 , a class ii yso and so clearly more evolved than the ylw  15 binary system , is only at 6@xmath4 ( 720  au in projection ) from ylw  15 .",
    "if it is truly so close to ylw  15 , gy  263 could have had in the past a close approach to ylw  15 and altered significantly the star formation process of ylw  15 , possibly reducing the accretion process to the circumbinary disk around ylw  15 ( which may explain the low millimeter flux of ylw  15 and the low momentum flux of the co outflow ) and , therefore , altering somewhat the evolutionary scenario of the binary system .",
    "we have carried out vla and vlba radio as well as comics / subaru mid - ir ( 8.8  @xmath12 m ) observations of the yso binary system in ylw  15 and carried out a study of the properties of ylw  15 from previous results available in the literature .",
    "the main conclusions are :    1 .",
    "the properties of the radio continuum emission of vla  1 and vla  2 show that these two sources have partially thick free - free emission , likely due to collimated , ionized winds , as it is the case of other class i and 0 ysos , with associated molecular and/or hh outflows .",
    "the centimeter vla  1 emission has a jet - like morphology , with the axis coinciding in position angle with the hh outflow found by grosso et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and a jet length of @xmath69 or @xmath70  au .",
    "undetected in the near - ir , becomes  visible  at 8.8  @xmath12 m .",
    "the 8.8  @xmath12 m emission is slightly resolved , with a deconvolved size of @xmath0  au , suggesting that the emission arises from a compact circumstellar structure around the protostar .",
    "the centimeter vla  2 emission is partially resolved at scales of 20  au .",
    "comparison with data taken at other wavelengths shows that vla  2 is the responsible of the near - ir emission and it is the source of the strong x - ray emission .",
    "this source appears unresolved at 8.8  @xmath12 m , implying a small circumstellar structure .",
    "vlba observations failed to detect continuum emission at 6  cm .",
    "the lack of  peri - stellar  emission is likely due to a high optical depth of the free - free emission , that arises at larger scales .",
    "shorter wavelengths should be used to detect the expected centimeter emission associated with the x - ray emission .",
    "the near to mid - ir properties of ylw  15 show that vla  1 is less luminous than vla  2 in this wavelength range .",
    "this could be due to a lower bolumetric luminosity of vla  1 compared with vla  2 or alternatively indicate that vla  1 is a more embedded yso , and thus , younger or less evolved , than vla  2 .",
    "vla  2 has the sed properties of a typical class i yso .",
    "therefore , vla  1 could be either in the same evolutionary state than vla  2 or either in the class 0 to class i transition .",
    "vla  1 appears to be more massive but more embedded or , alternatively , less luminous than vla  2 .",
    "this result is apparently against the expected evolutionary scenario , where one expects that the more massive yso in a binary system is also the more evolved and luminous yso .",
    "ylw  16a is detected with the vla .",
    "its position coincides well with the near - ir and x - ray emission observed in the region .",
