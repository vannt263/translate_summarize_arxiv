    "recently black phosphorus attracts much attention since the experimental demonstration of a field - effect transistor ( fet).@xcite several experimental and theoretical papers appeared in the last year , which has demonstrated its properties and potential applications .",
    "@xcite graphene is not viable for post - silicon electronics due to the lack of a band gap , while the band gap of black phosphorus can be tuned by changing the number of layers or applying an electric field.@xcite black phosphorus could potentially serve a whole range of purposes for fet , while retaining higher electron mobility than transition - metal dichalcogenides .",
    "the graphene analogue of black phosphorus is phosphorene , @xcite a monolayer sheet of phosphorus atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice .",
    "the structure of phosphorene is puckered , where the emergence of distinct zigzag ridges leads to highly anisotropic properties .",
    "while the majority of research is focused on bulk phosphorene , @xcite it is of interest to analyze the properties of phosphorene nanoribbons.@xcite zigzag graphene nanoribbons have zero - energy edge states , while armchair ones can be semiconducting or metallic , depending on their width.@xcite recently , it was shown that a similar picture holds true for phosphorene nanoribbons , where zigzag nanoribbons host a quasi - flat band detached from the bulk , corresponding to edge states near the fermi level,@xcite while armchair nanoribbons are semiconducting , and become metallic under a sufficiently strong electric field .",
    "@xcite    , ( b ) sac nanoribbon with @xmath1 , ( c ) nzz nanoribbon with @xmath2 and ( d ) nac nanoribbon with @xmath3 periodic along the parallel direction .",
    "unit cells are outlined for each case by the gray area .",
    "the colors denote the ridge structure , with red sublayer atoms shifted vertically above the blue sublayer atoms.,width=325 ]    in this paper , we propose a new type of edges in the anisotropic honeycomb lattice system without the @xmath4 rotational symmetry .",
    "phosphorene is the best example . on the one hand ,",
    "the planar honeycomb structure has the @xmath5 rotational symmetry . on the other hand , only the @xmath6 symmetry exists in the puckered structure due to the anisotropy , which allows us to introduce a new type of zigzag or armchair edges .",
    "in particular , we may cut the honeycomb sheet so that the zigzag ( armchair ) direction intersects the puckered ridges under an angle other than @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , as illustrated in fig . [",
    "fig1](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we refer to these nanoribbons as skewed - zigzag ( szz ) and skewed - armchair ( sac ) nanoribbons .",
    "these are a new type of edges .",
    "in contrast we refer to the normal nanoribbons as normal - zigzag ( nzz ) and normal - armchair ( nac ) nanoribbons , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig1](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "by calculating the band structure , we find that the szz nanoribbons are semiconducting while the sac nanoribbons are metallic . namely we have found an unexpected duality between a set of the skewed edges and a set of the normal edges : if the normal nanoribbon is metallic , the skewed one is insulating , and vice versa .",
    "this duality has a topological origin .",
    "we next show that the properties of these skewed edges are electrically tunable .",
    "first , an electric field along the width of the nanoribbon can close ( open ) the band gap in szz ( sac ) nanoribbons .",
    "second , it is remarkable that an arbitrarily small electric field perpendicular to the sheet , obtainable by vertical gating , can open a band gap in sac nanoribbons .",
    "it would become an insulator under @xmath9 mv at room temperature for phosphorene .",
    "this is not the case for nzz nanoribbons , where band gap opening is possible only for certain nanoribbons subjected to extremely large fields .",
    "although we use phosphorene as an explicit example , our arguments are applicable to any materials with anisotropic nearest neighbor hoppings .    .",
    "there are qfbs ( red curves ) in the sac and nzz nanoribbons , but not in the szz and nac nanoribbons .",
    "panels ( i ) and ( ii ) depict the real space localization of states belonging to qfbs at the crossed points in ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the magenta disks ( blue circles ) denote the probability weight on the atoms in the upper ( lower ) sublayer .",
    "the probability weight between the left and right edges are identical.,width=325 ]",
    "the tight - binding model is adequate to elucidate the new physics of the puckered system .",
    "it helps us to capture the essential physics irrespective of material details .",
    "the model hamiltonian reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 are parameters describing the hopping between the lattice sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 , while @xmath14 is the on - site energy induced by the electric field .",
    "we show the lattice structure of nanoribbons in fig .",
    "note that the szz ( sac ) direction is not parallel ( normal ) to the puckered ridges which are shown by red and blue disks .",
    "it is convenient to define the width @xmath15 of the normal ( skewed ) nanoribbon by one half ( quarter ) of the number of atoms in the unit cell , which we denote also by @xmath16 or @xmath17 ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) appropriately . for each nanoribbon",
    "we perform a fourier transform to the momentum basis , diagonalize the corresponding hamiltonian , and obtain in the band structure .    to display explicitly the band structure we employ the tight - binding hamiltonian derived recently by rudenko et al . for phosphorene,@xcite which contains @xmath20 hopping parameters @xmath11 up to the site separation @xmath21  .",
    "it reproduces well the band structure near the fermi level .",
    "typical band structures of szz , sac , nzz and nac nanoribbons are shown for the case of width @xmath22 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . on the one hand ,",
    "no edge states are present and a large band gap is opened in the szz nanoribbon .",
    "this is highly contrasted to the nzz nanoribbon [ fig . [ fig2](d ) ] , where there are edge - localized states.@xcite in this sense , the band structure of the szz nanoribbon resembles that of the nac nanoribbon.@xcite on the other hand , two quasi - flat bands ( qfbs ) appear in the middle of the band gap for the band structure of the sac nanoribbon , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig2](b ) .",
    "it is analogous to the nzz nanoribbon [ fig . [ fig2](c ) ] .",
    "indeed , it is possible to verify topologically that qfbs in the sac nanoribbon share the same topological origin as qfbs in the nzz nanoribbon .",
    "a comment is in order with respect to another set of edges .",
    "interestingly , adding one neighboring atom to the outermost atoms along the edge , turns skewed - zigzag ( armchair ) nanoribbon into a skewed - bearded ( dangled ) nanoribbon , with ( without ) quasi - flat bands .",
    "most likely , these nanoribbons are unstable and prone to passivization , but are nevertheless important in providing insight into the anisotropic honeycomb nanoribbon model . in fig .",
    "[ beard - dangle](a ) and ( b ) we show the real space layout of these nanoribbons .",
    "the band structures of such nanoribbons are shown in fig .",
    "[ beard - dangle](c ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "note that they are virtually identical to the band structures of the related nanoribbons they are derived from , apart from the fact that now edge states appear when they were not present before , and vice versa .",
    "we reveal the topological origin of the emergence and the absence of edge states .",
    "the essential structure of the anisotropic honeycomb lattice is given by the hamiltonian,@xcite @xmath23 with @xmath24 where three independent parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 describe the three nearest neighbor hoppings .",
    "it agrees with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) up to the nearest neighbor hopping , which is sufficient to capture the underlying physics .",
    "caution is needed when we analyze a nanoribbon .",
    "first , it is necessary to set @xmath27 for the normal edge , and @xmath28 for the skewed edge .",
    "second , although the phase of the function @xmath29 is arbitrary for the honeycomb sheet , it is to be fixed so as to make the coefficient of @xmath30 real for the outermost link according to the type of the edge.@xcite we thus use @xmath31 for the nzz and szz edges , and @xmath32 for the nac and sac edges .",
    "the momentum @xmath33 along the nanoribbon is a good quantum number .",
    "hence we consider a one - dimensional insulator indexed by @xmath33 , which may be topological or not .",
    "if it is topological for all @xmath33 , the edge is gapless due to the bulk - edge correspondence @xcite for all these one - dimensinal insulators .",
    "consequently we have predicted the emergence of a perfect flat band in the hamiltonian ( [ simplemodel ] ) .",
    "it is deformed into a realistic qfb when hoppings beyond the nearest neighbor ones are included.@xcite    the topological number is defined by the loop integral along the momentum @xmath34 orthogonal to the nanoribbon @xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the nzz and szz edges , while @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the nac and sac edges .",
    "the phase should be fixed as follows .",
    "for the general zigzag edge we have @xmath42 while for the general armchair edge we have @xmath43 for the general beard edge we have @xmath44 while for the general dangled edge we have @xmath45 the winding number can be obtained geometrically .",
    "the winding number counts how many times the phase of @xmath46 surrounds the origin .",
    "we find that the loop is formed in the re@xmath47 $ ] -im[@xmath46 ] plane as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "if the loop encircles the origin , @xmath50 , while if the loop does not encircle the origin , @xmath51 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figs](a2 ) , ( b2 ) , ( c2 ) and ( d2 ) .",
    "alternatively , we can explicitly evaluate the winding number using the residual theorem of the complex function , which are summarized in the following .          for the zigzag edge , by inserting ( [ smzz ] ) into ( [ topnum ] ) and setting @xmath52 ,",
    "the winding number is rewritten as @xmath53 a pole exists at @xmath54 the residual integral gives @xmath50 for @xmath55 and @xmath51 for @xmath56 .    hence , the condition of the emergence of the edge states is explicitly given by @xmath57 , or @xmath58 since @xmath59    for the skewed - zigzag edge , by setting @xmath60 , this condition is simplified as @xmath61 it is equals to @xmath62 there is no solution for @xmath33 when @xmath57 , or @xmath63 . in conclusion ,",

    "note that our topological arguments are applicable to any materials with anisotropic nearest neighbor hoppings with the condition @xmath80 in ( [ simplemodel ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we would like to stress that the topological nature of edge states in phosphorene is not the same as edge states in conventional 2d topological insulators .",

    "it is a standard technique to employ an electric field to control the band gap .",
    "we start with a discussion on the effects of lateral gating .",
    "we can close the band gap of szz nanoribbons by applying an electric field @xmath87 along the nanoribbon width [ fig.[fig3](a ) ] . due to a large stark effect",
    ", the conduction ( valence ) bands are shifted downwards ( upwards ) in energy , resulting in an insulator - metal transition .",
    "the critical field is smaller for wider nanoribbons due to the following two reasons : i ) wider nanoribbons experience larger potential variation along the width direction due to the field , making them more sensitive to smaller fields ; ii ) the band gap of wider nanoribbons in the absence of external fields is smaller , and asymptotically approaches the bulk band gap for wide enough naroribbons , which is @xmath88 ev for phosphorene.@xcite these two effects are illustrated in fig . [",
    "fig3](b ) for @xmath89 and @xmath84 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) we take a closer look at the qfbs under an applied electric field @xmath87 .",
    "one can see that sac nanoribbons can be transformed into an insulator by lateral gating since the two - fold degenerate edge states split into opposite directions , thus breaking the double degeneracy .",
    "the wave functions become localized at the nanoribbon edge for the occupied and unoccupied qfb , as shown in the panels ( i ) and ( ii ) , respectively .",
    "the conductances are switched off , which implies that sac nanoribbons act as an fet by @xmath87 .",
    "we proceed to investigate the effects of the electric field perpendicular to the honeycomb sheet ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "first we analyze nzz nanoribbons . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the band structure , and the corresponding conductance of ( a ) @xmath90 and ( b ) @xmath91 nanoribbons , for @xmath92 ( black full curves ) , @xmath93 v / (blue dotted curves ) and @xmath94 v / (red dashed curves ) .",
    "intriguingly , we find that the behavior near the fermi level at half filling ( depicted by a dot ) depends crucially on the parity of @xmath16 .    when @xmath16 is an even number , the two outermost ridges of the nanoribbon , which support most of the weight of the edge states , belong to different sublayers .",
    "therefore , applying @xmath0 will differentiate the two degenerate qfbs , and split them into opposite directions . for a sufficiently strong @xmath0 an energy gap appears between the two bands , and",
    "since only the lower band is filled at half - filling , this constitutes an fet action .",
    "the critical field is high ( @xmath95 mv /  ) , which is independent of the width , unless the nanoribbons are very narrow .",
    "the reason for such a high critical field is the relatively large bandwidth of the qfbs .",
    "the edge state at the momentum @xmath96 is almost localized at the outermost ridge , while the wave function penetrates into the bulk as @xmath33 reaches @xmath97 .",
    "accordingly , the shift of the energy at @xmath96 is maximum and that at @xmath98 is minimum .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath16 is an odd number , the outermost ridges exist in the same plane as shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( c ) .",
    "accordingly , both bands of the edge states shift in the same direction by applying @xmath0 , keeping the degeneracy intact , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "hence , a gap can not be induced by @xmath0 at half - filing . namely it is necessary that @xmath16 is even to make a fet .",
    "furthermore , an extremely large electric field is necessary to open a gap , which is an obstacle for fet operation .",
    "finally we analyze sac nanoribbons . in fig . [",
    "fig4](c ) and ( d ) we depict the band structure of @xmath99 and @xmath100 nanoribbons , respectively .",
    "one can see that @xmath0 opens a band gap , by shifting the conduction ( valence ) band up ( down ) .",
    "the double degeneracy of the folded bands are preserved , which is evident from the conductance .",
    "the corresponding edge states with finite @xmath0 become predominantly localized on the upper ( lower ) sublayer , as shown in panels ( i ) and ( ii ) of fig .",
    "accordingly , the edge states corresponding to the positive - curvature ( electron - like ) valence bands move to lower energy , while those corresponding to the negative - curvature ( hole - like ) conduction bands move to higher energy . hence , the electric field separates the electron- and hole - like states and bands apart .",
    "this is the stark effect .",
    "importantly , a gap opens under arbitrarily small electric field .",
    "we find @xmath9 mv in order to open a gap corresponding to the room temperature .",
    "moreover , note that there are no parity issues in sac nanoribbons ; they all respond in the same manner to an external electric field , regardless of the width . in conclusion , sac nanoribbons",
    "may well be suited for practical devices .",
    "in our analysis we have assumed atomically precise edges , about which we make a few comments .",
    "( i ) structural relaxation and the effect of dangling bonds can be properly treated by means of first - principles calculations .",
    "previous first - principles calculations have shown @xcite that the quasi - flat bands are robust for pristine normal nanoribbons when taking into account the structural relaxation and dangling bonds .",
    "we might expect that our results are also valid for pristine nanoribbons .",
    "( ii ) edge states will emerge when there are some regions whose edges are locally precise although the global edge structure is disordered .",
    "indeed , edge states of graphene have been observed even when the edge is not perfectly precise .",
    "@xcite ( iii ) with respect to the impact of the electric field , the shift of the qfb will be robust in the presence of disorder since it is due to the total imbalance of the upper and lower electron distribution , which is independent of the details of the edge roughness",
    ".    we also comment on the numerical values such as the critical electric field we have derived for phosphorene . since they are derived based on the tight - binding model , they can be modified by first - principles calculations .",
    "nevertheless , our results give an order of magnitude estimate , which will benefit future experimental works .    in conclusion , we have proposed a new type of edges , the szz and sac edges , that can appear in puckered honeycomb systems , and revealed intriguing properties inherent to nanoribbons possessing these edges .",
    "the sac nanoribbon is particularly interesting , since it has qfbs whose origin is topological , and since a gap opens by applying an arbitrary small electric field @xmath0 . this property may allow a fet to be designed .",
