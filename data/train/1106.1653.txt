    "recent ground based and _ spitzer _ observations ( zuckerman & becklin 1987 ; graham 1990 ; farihi 2010 ) have revealed the presence of infrared excesses in spectra of a number of metal - rich white dwarfs ( wd ) .",
    "these excesses have been interpreted ( jura 2003 ) as arising from reprocessing of stellar emission by a compact disk of refractory debris orbiting the wd .",
    "detailed spectral modeling ( jura 2003 ; farihi 2010 ) suggests that these disks are geometrically thin and essentially flat , although in some cases there is certain evidence for flaring or warping ( jura 2007b , 2009 ) .",
    "spectral fitting also finds the disks to be predominantly optically thick ( jura 2003 ; farihi 2010 ) , even though this statement may not hold in some parts of the disk ( jura 2007b , 2009 ) .",
    "these properties make circum - wd debris disks look very similar to the ring of saturn ( cuzzi 2010 ) .",
    "outer radii @xmath9 of these disks are always found to be @xmath10 r@xmath11 ( jura 2007 ; farihi 2010 ) .",
    "this is close to the roche radius @xmath12 , within which any object of normal density ( @xmath13 g @xmath14 ) would be disrupted by the tidal forces of the wd .",
    "this observation motivated the idea ( jura 2003 ) that compact debris disks owe their origin to the tidal destruction of massive asteroid - like bodies , which were scattered into the low - periastron orbits by planets that have survived the agb stage of stellar evolution .",
    "inner radii of disks are usually small , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the wd radius , although the exact number depends on the details of spectral modeling ( jura 2007 ) . in some cases",
    "@xmath17 is close to the distance at which a refractory body heated by the direct starlight would have a temperature equal to the sublimation temperature @xmath18 , suggesting that the inner cutoff of the disk is caused by particle sublimation .",
    "however , in some cases such interpretation implies very high value of @xmath18 ( jura 2007 ; brinkworth 2009 ; dufour 2010 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is always safe to assume that the ratio of the outer to inner disk radii is rather modest , @xmath19 .",
    "this will turn out being important later on , see  [ subsect : large_narrow ] .",
    "a significant reservoir of refractory material in the immediate vicinity of the wd can naturally be responsible for contaminating the atmospheres of these wds by metals ( jura 2003 ) .",
    "this idea is strongly supported by the fact that the infrared excesses due to compact debris disks have been observed only around metal - rich wds with rather high metal accretion rates ( farihi 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "alternative model of the wd metal pollution by interstellar accretion ( dupuis 1993a ) runs into problem trying to account for the abundance ratios of different elements in the wd atmospheres , in particular , greatly suppressed hydrogen abundance ( dupuis 1993b ) .    the new model of metal accretion from a _",
    "circumstellar _ reservoir of high - z material raises a natural question : how do metals get transported to the wd surface from the debris disk , which has an inner gap with the radius @xmath17 ?",
    "it is reasonable to assume that at @xmath17 disk particles get converted into metal gas by the intense heating due to the wd radiation , which then viscously accretes onto the wd .",
    "however , the issue of whether the debris disk can sustain the high metal accretion rates @xmath20 up to several @xmath21 g s@xmath2 inferred in some systems has not been clear for a long time .",
    "recently rafikov ( 2011a ; hereafter r11 ) showed that coupling of the disk to stellar radiation via the poynting - robertson ( pr ) effect ( burns 1979 ) can result in metal accretion rates @xmath22 g s@xmath2 .",
    "later rafikov ( 2011b ) has also demonstrated that under certain circumstances even higher values of @xmath20 can arise from the interaction between the debris disk and metal gas that is produced by the sublimation at @xmath17 .",
    "the model of radiatively driven accretion of r11 did not cover the large scale evolution of the debris disk resulting from the pr drag , and made certain assumptions ( e.g. high optical depths of the disk ) which were not rigorously verified .",
    "the goal of this work is to extend the analysis of r11 and to develop a detailed global model of the compact debris disk evolution caused by the pr drag .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sect : theory ] we outline the basic picture of the pr - driven debris accretion and derive master equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) that describes global evolution of the disk .",
    "we then explore in ",
    "[ sect : low ] both analytically and numerically the evolution of a low mass , optically thin disk of debris . in ",
    "[ sect : high ] we study global evolution of massive , optically thick debris disks starting with different initial spatial distributions of debris around the wd ( ring - like ,  [ subsect : large_narrow ] , [ subsect : small ] , or disk - like ,  [ subsect : disk ] ) to see the effect on the global disk evolution .",
    "we discuss our results and their observational implications in ",
    "[ sect : disc ] .",
    "in the following we consider an axisymmetric disk of particles extending from @xmath17 to @xmath9 in radius . the inner radius may coincide with the sublimation radius @xmath23 , at which the effective temperature of particles equals the sublimation temperature @xmath18 : r_s= ( ) ^222  r_t_,4 ^ 2 ( ) ^2 , [ eq : r_s ] where @xmath16 is the wd radius , @xmath24 k for silicate grains , and @xmath25 k ) is the normalized stellar temperature @xmath26 .",
    "taking @xmath27 one finds @xmath28 r@xmath11 , in agreement with observationally inferred inner radii of compact debris disks ( jura 2007 , 2009a ) .    when particles reach the sublimation radius they produce metallic gas , which joins the gaseous disk extending down to the wd surface .",
    "metal accretion onto the wd surface proceeds through this disk .",
    "although this metal gas also spreads outward from the sublimation radius ( melis 2010 ) and under certain circumstances can substantially affect debris disk evolution ( rafikov 2011b ) , in this work , following r11 , we concentrate only on effects associated with the pr drag . thus , here we neglect presence of the gas exterior of @xmath23 and its interaction with the debris disk .",
    "according to rafikov ( 2011b ) this is a valid approximation as long as the viscous timescale in the gaseous disk is shorter than the time on which this disk can be replenished by the sublimation of debris .",
    "then the gas does not accumulate at @xmath29 and its density is always low enough for the gas drag to not affect the debris disk appreciably .",
    "we characterize the disk at each point by its surface density @xmath30 and optical depth = , [ eq : tau ] where @xmath31 is the bulk density of particles and @xmath32 is their characteristic size .",
    "the particle size @xmath32 is not well constrained by the existing observations , but its actual value becomes important only for low mass disks with small @xmath33 , see  [ sect : low ] .",
    "following friedjung ( 1985 ) and r11 we represent irradiation of the disk by the wd using a single incidence angle @xmath34 at each radius @xmath35 from the disk ( the so - called `` lamp - post '' illumination model described in r11 ) : ( r ) = , [ eq : alpha ] where @xmath36 is the radius of the star .",
    "we can then introduce _ optical depth to incoming starlight _",
    "@xmath37 according to the following definition : _ = ^-1 .",
    "[ eq : tau_par ] this variable is very important for our subsequent analysis . in the following",
    "we will call the disk optically thick or thin based on whether @xmath38 and not @xmath33 is greater or smaller than unity .",
    "r11 demonstrated that the mass accretion rate @xmath5 through the disk of solids driven by the pr drag may be written as m(r)= ( r ) _",
    "r. [ eq : mdot ] here @xmath39 is the wd luminosity , @xmath40 is the speed of light and function _",
    "r = 1 - e^- _ [ eq : phi ] gives the fraction of incoming starlight that is absorbed by the disk .",
    "it is instructive to examine different limits of the expression ( [ eq : mdot ] ) .",
    "if the disk is optically thick to incident stellar radiation , @xmath41 ( which can not be the case everywhere at all times , as we will see below ) , then the accretion rate is independent of @xmath37 and is given simply by m__1(r)m(r,_1)= ( r ) .",
    "[ eq : mdot_pr1 ] in particular , at the sublimation radius given by equation ( [ eq : r_s ] ) this accretion rate is equal to m_&= & m__1(r_s)= ( ) ^2 [ eq : mdot_pr ] + & & 710 ^ 7  ^-1 ( r_,-2 t_,4)^2 .",
    "r11 has shown this numerical estimate to be consistent with the lower envelope of the @xmath20 values inferred for the metal - rich wds exhibiting detectable ir emission associated with their debris disks .    in the opposite limit of a disk , which is optically thin to incident stellar radiation , @xmath42 ,",
    "one finds m__1 = .",
    "[ eq : mdot_de ]    it is easy to show that this expression coincides with @xmath5 that one would calculate by simply assuming disk particles to be directly illuminated by starlight ( i.e. unobscured by other particles ) and considering each of them as independent from others . azimuthal pr drag force acting on a single , perfectly absorbing particle of mass @xmath43 is given by f_= a^2 , where @xmath44 is keplerian angular velocity .",
    "this force gives rise to radial drift velocity v_r = = , and results in mass accretion rate @xmath45 , which is easily shown to reduce to equation ( [ eq : mdot_de ] ) .",
    "evolution of the debris disk is described by the continuity equation - = 0 , [ eq : cont ] with @xmath5 given by equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) .",
    "we introduce new dimensionless time and space variables x , t , [ eq : dim ] where t_0 [ eq : t_0 ] is the characteristic timescale of the problem .",
    "if @xmath17 coincides with the sublimation radius @xmath23 defined in ( [ eq : r_s ] ) then t_0 = 5 10 ^ 4  ( ) ^4 , [ eq : t_0_sub ] where we took @xmath46 g @xmath14 .",
    "using equations ( [ eq : alpha])-([eq : phi ] ) and definitions ( [ eq : dim ] ) , ( [ eq : t_0 ] ) we can bring the continuity equation ( [ eq : cont ] ) to a scale - free form : - ( ) = 0 .",
    "[ eq:1 ] a notable fact about equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) is that it does not contain any free parameters .",
    "once @xmath47 is obtained by solving this equation , one can easily infer mass accretion rate at any point in the disk since m(x , t ) = m _ , [ eq : y ] where @xmath48 is defined by equation ( [ eq : mdot_pr ] ) . because the viscous timescale of the gas produced by debris sublimation is very short compared to the disk evolution time ( r11 ) , the metal accretion rate onto the wd surface @xmath20",
    "is given simply by m_z(t)=m(x=1,t)=m _ . in the following",
    "we will use @xmath49 and @xmath50 interchangingly .",
    "analysis of equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) may be simplified if we introduce a new function @xmath51 , which is just the mass accretion rate through the debris disk normalized by @xmath48",
    ". then equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) transforms to + ( y - ) = 0 .",
    "[ eq:2 ] it has an implicit solution y = f(xy - y^2 t + ( 1-xy ) ) , [ eq : imp ] where @xmath52 is an arbitrary function , which is set by the initial surface density distribution of the debris . unfortunately",
    ", inferring @xmath52 from @xmath53 is not a trivial task , which makes analysis of solution ( [ eq : imp ] ) very difficult .",
    "nevertheless , we can still deduce useful information about the behavior of this solution in some specific limits , see  [ sect : low ] and appendix [ app:1 ] .",
    "we now proceed to investigate the details of the global disk evolution with different initial conditions .",
    "we start by considering the case of a tenuous disk , in which the optical depth for incident stellar radiation @xmath54 . in that case according to equation ( [ eq : y ] ) @xmath55 and the nonlinear term @xmath56 can be neglected in equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) reducing it to - = 0 .",
    "[ eq : lin ] this linear equation has an explicit solution y = y_0 ( ) , [ eq : sol ] where @xmath57 is the initial spatial distribution of variable @xmath58 set by the initial surface density distribution @xmath59 .",
    "if initially the debris was concentrated in a structure ( a disk or a ring ) with characteristic dimensionless scale @xmath60 ( physical scale @xmath61 ) , then it follows from equation ( [ eq : lin ] ) that the characteristic time @xmath62 on which @xmath37 evolves is t_thin = t_0 x^2 ,  t_thin = x^2 .",
    "[ eq : t_thin ] this time is independent of the disk mass but is sensitive to its size @xmath60 and particle properties , see equation ( [ eq : t_0_sub ] ) .",
    "this is not surprising since when @xmath54 particles interact with the wd radiation independently of each other and drift towards the wd on a pr timescale of an _ individual _ particle .",
    "the latter coincides with @xmath62 up to constant factors and is indeed a function of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the distance @xmath35 that needs to be traveled .     everywhere .",
    "initial density profile is given by equation ( [ eq : prof ] ) with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "thick curves are the numerical results for the optical depth to incoming starlight @xmath47 ( related to @xmath66 via equations ( [ eq : tau])-([eq : tau_par ] ) ) at different moments of time indicated on the panel , while the thin curves represent analytical solution ( [ eq : thin_sol ] ) .",
    "[ fig : thin ] ]    disks which are optically thin to incident stellar radiation must satisfy a certain mass constraint .",
    "the mass of a disk extending out to @xmath67 can be written as m_d & = & 2_r_in^r_out(r)rdr= m_0_1^x_out(x)dx , [ eq : m_d ] where the characteristic disk mass @xmath68 is defined as m_0a r _ r_in10 ^ 20   .",
    "[ eq : m_0 ] and the numerical estimate assumes @xmath46 g @xmath14 , and @xmath69 .",
    "this numerical value of @xmath68 corresponds to the disruption of an asteroid with the diameter of 40 km .",
    "the disk which is optically thin everywhere ( @xmath70 ) should have mass @xmath71 since @xmath72 is of order unity for wd debris disks .",
    "we numerically integrated equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) for an initial ring - like density profile given by _ ( x,0)xy_0(x ) = _ , 0 , [ eq : prof ] with @xmath73 . in figure",
    "[ fig : thin ] we show the results obtained for the case @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , i.e. a rather narrow , tenuous ring , with the radius large compared to @xmath17 .",
    "we also plot analytical solution for @xmath73 _ ( x , t ) , [ eq : thin_sol ] which follows from ( [ eq : sol ] ) .",
    "one can see that analytical solution reproduces the numerical results quite well . as time goes by the ring of material drifts towards the wd and broadens , simply because the speed of inward migration due to the pr drag increases as @xmath60 decreases .",
    "this eventually results in substantial surface density reaching the inner radius and giving rise to sublimation there .",
    "metal gas produced at @xmath17 then directly accretes onto the wd .",
    "metal accretion rate @xmath74 in the optically thin case , simply because the initial value of @xmath75 everywhere in the disk and equation ( [ eq : sol ] ) then predicts that @xmath76 for any @xmath77 .",
    "using solution ( [ eq : sol ] ) we can derive an explicit formula for @xmath50 for the initial debris density distribution ( [ eq : prof ] ) : m(x=1,t ) .",
    "[ eq : mdot_thin ] in figure [ fig : mdot1 ] we compare this expression with the numerically derived @xmath50 and again the agreement is reasonably good . mass accretion rate peaks at @xmath78 when the expression inside the exponential in ( [ eq : mdot_thin ] ) goes to zero .",
    "the maximum accretion rate achieved at this moment is about @xmath79 , in agreement the numerical results shown in figure [ fig : mdot1 ] .     for a low - mass optically thin disk ( same as in figure [ fig : thin ] ) ,",
    "normalized by @xmath48 .",
    "solid and dotted curves are the numerical and analytical [ equation ( [ eq : mdot_thin ] ) ] results .",
    "[ fig : mdot1 ] ]",
    "now we consider evolution of massive debris disks with mass exceeding @xmath68 defined by ( [ eq : m_0 ] ) .",
    "such disks have @xmath41 at least at some radii .",
    "this condition can not be true throughout the whole disk as there should always be regions in which @xmath80 , e.g. near the disk edges .",
    "even if they do not exist initially such optically thin regions naturally appear as a result of disk evolution as we show below .    whenever @xmath41 one can neglect the term proportional to @xmath81 in equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) and obtain the following simple solution : _ ( x , t)=_(x , t=0)- , [ eq : thick_sol ] or , in dimensional units , ( r , t)=(r , t=0)- t. [ eq : thick_sol_sigma ] this solution implies that in parts of the disk , which are optically thick to incoming stellar radiation the surface density steadily decreases in time at a constant rate set only by the distance from the wd .",
    "this behavior is a direct consequence of the @xmath5 saturation at the level @xmath82 independent of @xmath37 in the case @xmath41 , see equation ( [ eq : mdot_pr1 ] ) .    at a glance",
    "this kind of evolution looks very strange as the debris does not seem to move anywhere  @xmath83 simply goes down at all radii .",
    "this interesting behavior can be understood only by accounting for the optically thin regions that should inevitably be present in the disk and their interplay with the optically thick part of the disk .",
    "we demonstrate this in  [ subsect : thick - num ] .",
    "solution ( [ eq : thick_sol ] ) also implies that the characteristic timescale of the disk evolution is now t_thick ~t_0_(x)x^2= , [ eq : t_thick ] or @xmath84 in dimensionless units .",
    "clearly , @xmath85 is ( up to factors of order unity ) just the time , on which the characteristic disk mass @xmath86 gets exhausted by accretion at the rate @xmath87 . unlike @xmath62 defined by equation ( [ eq : t_thin ] )",
    "@xmath85 is independent of particle properties  @xmath31 and @xmath32 , but scales linearly with the disk mass .",
    "we numerically integrated evolution of several initially optically thick density distributions .",
    "the morphologies we consider range from a narrow ring to an extended disk of debris .",
    "they represent different initial spatial distributions of the debris that might possibly result from the tidal disruption of an asteroid .",
    "we choose all disks to have the same total mass @xmath88 initially and concentrate on exploring the differences of their evolutionary routes caused purely by the morphology .",
    "we start by exploring the initial distribution in the form ( [ eq : prof ] ) with @xmath89 , @xmath90 but now we take @xmath91 so that the disk mass @xmath92 .",
    "resulting evolution of @xmath37 is shown in figure [ fig : gauss5 ] .",
    "apart from the theoretically expected steady decrease of @xmath37 with time in the bulk of the disk where @xmath41 one immediately notices two interesting features of the solutions : ( 1 ) a sharp drop of the disk surface density at the outer edge of the disk , and ( 2 ) an optically thin ( @xmath80 ) tail of debris extending from the optically thick region all the way to @xmath17 , which remains stable throughout the evolution of the disk .",
    "we now discuss the nature of these features in more detail .     for an optically thick disk with the gaussian initial density profile ( [ eq : prof ] ) , assuming @xmath64 , @xmath65 and total mass @xmath88 ( large and narrow ring ) .",
    "radial profiles of @xmath38 are shown at different moments of time indicated on the panel .",
    "note the appearance of an optically thin tail of debris extending to @xmath93 and the sharpness of the outer disk edge .",
    "[ fig : gauss5 ] ]    sharp outer edge appears because the evolution timescale of a particular disk region @xmath94 , see equation ( [ eq : t_thick ] ) .",
    "initial density distribution in the form ( [ eq : prof ] ) has @xmath38 increasing _ inwards _ in the outer part of the ring .",
    "this causes the outermost extremity of the ring ( which is optically thin and evolves on timescale @xmath62 ) to migrate towards the wd faster than the parts of the ring closer to the wd do . as a result ,",
    "the outermost disk material catches up with the debris at smaller @xmath60 having higher @xmath38 , leading to a debris pileup there and formation of a sharp outer edge .",
    "this edge appears on a timescale @xmath95 since this is the characteristic time , on which the material from the optically thin outer disk region reaches @xmath96 where most of the ring mass is concentrated .",
    "we provide a more rigorous justification for the outer edge appearance in appendix [ app:1 ] .",
    "origin of the quasi - stationary tail with @xmath80 at small @xmath35 can be understood as follows .",
    "even if initially the disk has @xmath97 everywhere such tail would rapidly form since , according to equation ( [ eq : thick_sol ] ) , at any distance from the wd @xmath38 should switch into the optically thin regime within finite time .",
    "this happens fastest at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "after the tail has formed it evolves on a timescale @xmath62 given by equation ( [ eq : t_thin ] ) .",
    "inner parts of the tail evolve more rapidly than the outer ones and a quasi - steady state is attained in the tail with @xmath5 almost independent of @xmath35 .",
    "this point is illustrated in figure [ fig : y ] , where we show the run of @xmath98 for a calculation displayed in figure [ fig : gauss5 ] at different moments of time .",
    "one can easily see that after some evolution has taken place @xmath99 indeed becomes independent of @xmath60 in the tail .",
    "( equation ( [ eq : y ] ) ) through the debris disk at different moments of time .",
    "results are shown for the same disk as in fig .",
    "[ fig : gauss5 ] .",
    "note that @xmath100 near @xmath93 , i.e. in the optically thin tail .",
    "[ fig : y ] ]    thus , the behavior of @xmath47 in the tail can be described by the equation ( cf . equation ( [ eq : y ] ) ) = y_tail(t)= , [ eq : tail ] where @xmath101 is the mass accretion rate through the tail ( and @xmath102 is the dimensionless analog of this quantity ) , which in general is a function of time . equation ( [ eq : tail ] ) describes the behavior of @xmath38 in figure [ fig : gauss5 ] as a function of @xmath60 quite well .    at some radius @xmath103",
    "the tail becomes optically thick , i.e. @xmath104 . a this point the tail merges with the optically thick part of the disk and the evolution timescale , which is now given by @xmath85 , rapidly increases , see equation ( [ eq : t_thick ] ) .",

    "thus , it is the dependence of @xmath106 on @xmath77 that determines how the mass accretion rate through the tail and at @xmath17 changes with time .    to find @xmath108 we need to set the left hand side of equation ( [ eq : thick_sol ] ) to unity and solve the resultant equation for @xmath60 as a function of @xmath77 .",

    "after @xmath135 has dropped below unity the crossover radius @xmath106 starts moving out and @xmath137 goes down . using equations (",
    "[ eq : thick_sol1 ] ) and ( [ eq : top - hat ] ) we infer that in the top - hat case @xmath138 for @xmath139 , resulting in m_z m_()^1/2 .",
    "[ eq : approx ] this analytical prediction is shown by dotted line in figure [ fig : mdot2 ] and clearly agrees well with the numerical result for the initial top - hat density distribution .",

    "in this paper we focused on studying how the debris disk evolves due to the pr drag alone . among other radiative effects potentially affecting such disks we can mention the direct transfer of the radiative angular momentum to the disk that occurs if the wd is rapidly rotating .",
    "previously walker & meszaros ( 1989 ) suggested this process to be important for the evolution of accretion disks around neutron stars experiencing type i x - ray bursts , which often rotate quite rapidly . in the case of wds",
    "there is no good evidence for rapid rotation ( kawaler 2004 ) with several disk - hosting systems showing @xmath142 km s@xmath2 ( gnsicke 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "however , one can easily demonstrate that even if wd were to rotate at breakup speed the radiative angular momentum transport would still not produce wd disk evolution comparable to that caused by the pr drag .",
    "indeed , the angular momentum carried by photons emitted by the wd rotating with equatorial speed @xmath143 can be estimated as @xmath144 .",
    "disk absorbs some fraction of this angular momentum which exerts radiative torque @xmath145 on the disk .",
    "the ratio of this torque to the torque due to the pr drag @xmath146 is easily shown to be ~ , [ eq : trat ] where @xmath44 is the keplerian angular frequency .",
    "even if the wd rotates at breakup and @xmath147 one still finds @xmath148 , which is less than unity because the debris disk lies quite far from the wd surface , i.e. @xmath149 . moreover , measured rotational speeds of the aforementioned wds are @xmath150 of their breakup speed , so the direct radiative transfer of angular momentum to debris has negligible effect on disks in these systems .    one of the key results of this work is that the low metal accretion rates onto the wd @xmath151 are possible only if the debris disk hosted by the wd has small mass , below @xmath68 given by equation ( [ eq : m_0 ] ) , and is everywhere optically thin to incident stellar radiation .",
    "this is demonstrated in  [ sect : low ] where we find @xmath152 ( see equation ( [ eq : sol ] ) ) throughout the whole evolution of the low mass disk .    on the contrary , if the disk is massive enough to contain optically thick regions , which typically requires @xmath153 g , then @xmath20 is guaranteed to not fall below @xmath154 , as we have shown in ",
    "[ sect : high ] .",
    "this is in agreement with the statement in r11 that @xmath20 should not deviate significantly from @xmath115 for optically thick disks .",
    "this lower bound on @xmath20 for massive disks is very robust , in particular it does not depend on the disk mass .",
    "this point is illustrated in figure [ fig : mdot3 ] where we show the time evolution of @xmath20 for three disks with the same initial gaussian density distribution ( [ eq : prof ] ) but with different initial masses @xmath155 set to be in the ratio @xmath156 .",
    "one can easily see that the only thing , which is different between these three cases is the disk lifetime ( which is always proportional to the disk mass ) , while @xmath20 is essentially the same .     for three massive , optically thick disks with the same initial gaussian density profile ( [ eq : prof ] ) and @xmath64 , @xmath65 , but different initial masses in the ratio 0.5:1:2 .",
    "note that the amplitude of @xmath50 is essentially independent of the disk mass , only the disk lifetime depends on it .",
    "[ fig : mdot3 ] ]    the time evolution of @xmath20 in the optically thick case is found to depend predominantly on the shape of the initial density distribution .",
    "debris distributions in the form of a narrow ring tend to produce @xmath20 only weakly varying with time .",
    "extended initial distributions of the debris with radial width comparable to mean radius generally lead to @xmath20 varying in time and decaying by a factor of several by the end of the disk lifetime , see figure [ fig : mdot2 ] .",
    "based on these results one should expect wds with strong ir excesses , signifying massive , optically thick debris disk around them , to exhibit @xmath157 .",
    "this is exactly what the current data seem to suggest : no wd with a debris disk detected via its ir signature is inferred to have @xmath20 below @xmath115 ( r11 ) .",
    "however , if the systems exhibiting ir excesses were found to show @xmath74 , the debris disks around them should be optically thin .",
    "it is then natural to expect a positive correlation between the strength of the ir excess and the @xmath20 in such systems , since both are linearly proportional to @xmath75 in the optically thin regime .",
    "indeed , @xmath158 according to ( [ eq : sol ] ) while the amount of the wd luminosity that the optically thin disk intercepts and reradiates in the near - ir is l_d_r_in^r_out ( r)dr , [ eq : l_d ] which also scales positively with @xmath38 .",
    "the timescale on which debris disks get depleted can be quite different in the optically thick and thin cases .",
    "characteristic lifetime of an optically thin disk composed of @xmath126 cm particles @xmath62 is several @xmath159 yr , as equations ( [ eq : t_0_sub ] ) and ( [ eq : t_thin ] ) demonstrate .",
    "this timescale depends only on the debris particle properties  size and density , being longer for bigger and denser particles  and the outer extent of the disk ( for @xmath160 one finds disk lifetime approaching a myr ) .    in the case of an optically thick disk",
    "the lifetime can be considerably longer since @xmath85 scales linearly with the disk mass , see equation ( [ eq : t_thick ] ) .",
    "thus , massive disks require long time to get exhausted by the pr drag alone .",
    "for example , an optically thick disk created by the tidal disruption of an asteroid with the diameter of 300 km would have a mass of @xmath161 g ( assuming bulk density of 3 g @xmath14 ) .",
    "accretion at the steady rate @xmath162 g s@xmath2 ( @xmath163 given by the numerical estimate in equation ( [ eq : mdot_pr ] ) ) would deplete this disk only within 40 myr .",
    "such massive disks , however , are likely to be affected by the interaction with the gas that is produced by sublimation of solid debris at the inner edge of the disk",
    ". they may then evolve in a runaway fashion as described in rafikov ( 2011b ) and get exhausted much earlier .",
    "an interesting finding of this work is the universal appearance of the sharp outer edge in optically thick disks , caused by the faster inward migration of the disk annuli having smaller optical depth .",
    "this outer edge steadily moves inwards which , combined with the outward expansion of the optically thin tail at small radii , leads to the gradual reduction of the radial width of the optically thick part of the debris disk .",
    "thus , even an extended disk can turn into a narrow ring with time as can be easily seen in figure [ fig : tophat ] .",
    "observational evidence for sharp outer edges would strongly support the picture of disk evolution due to the pr drag outlined in this work .",
    "interestingly , jura ( 2007b , 2009 ) have previously claimed the need for existence of the _ outer optically thin _ regions in debris disks around some wds .",
    "however , inferring the sharpness of the outer disk edge and the precise value of its optical depth is a nontrivial task since any knowledge about the radial density distribution in these disks is based on modeling their spectral energy distributions . inverting disk spectrum to determine the fine details of the radial distribution of debris is a rather ambiguous procedure , additionally complicated by the possibility of disk warping or flaring ( jura 2007b , 2009 ) .",
