    "the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm @xcite ) is the simplest supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the standard model with a scale invariant superpotential , i.e. where the soft susy breaking terms are the only dimensionful parameters .",
    "a supersymmetric higgs mass term @xmath8 , as required in the mssm , is generated dynamically by a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a gauge singlet ( super-)field @xmath9 , and is automatically of the order of the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "the attractive features of the mssm are preserved , like a solution of the hierarchy problem , the unification of the running gauge coupling constants at a grand unification ( gut ) scale , and a dark matter candidate in the form of a stable lightest susy particle ( lsp ) .",
    "using data from @xmath10  fb@xmath11 of integrated luminosity at the lhc at 7  tev center of mass ( c.m . ) energy , searches for supersymmetry by the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations have not led to the discovery of signals of supersymmetric particles .",
    "however , already within the mssm , the interpretation of the absence ( or presence ) of signals in the many possible channels depends on the soft susy breaking terms : assuming r - parity conservation and a neutralino - like lsp , missing transverse energy @xmath12 together with high @xmath13 jets and/or leptons are used as search criteria .",
    "these signatures depend on the decay cascades of the initially produced squarks and gluinos ( dominant at a hadron collider ) , which depend on the spectrum and the couplings of sparticles ( squarks , gluino , sleptons , charginos and neutralinos ) , and hence on the soft susy breaking terms .    a popular choice for the soft susy breaking terms is the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) where scalar masses @xmath14 , gaugino masses @xmath3 and trilinear couplings @xmath15 are assumed to be universal at the gut scale . in the cmssm ,",
    "the lightest neutralino @xmath16 is typically the lsp , and bino - like in most of the parameter space ( apart from very small values of @xmath14 , or very large values of both @xmath14 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "@xmath16 appears as one of the final states in every sparticle decay cascade , and is responsible for the missing transverse energy .    assuming fixed values for @xmath15 and @xmath17 ( the ratio of the two higgs vevs @xmath18 )",
    ", the atlas and cms collaborations have deduced lower bounds on @xmath14 and @xmath3 in the @xmath19  plane in the cmssm .",
    "recently , the absence of signals has been interpreted within more general scenarios of soft susy breaking terms as the phenomenological mssm @xcite and anomaly mediation @xcite . in the present paper , we perform a first study of possible modifications of signals for supersymmetric particles in the framework of a generalization of the cmssm towards the nmssm .",
    "the additional gauge singlet superfield @xmath20 in the nmssm leads to additional physical states in the cp - even and cp - odd higgs sectors , as well as an additional singlino - like neutralino .",
    "the impact of the additional higgs states can be very important for higgs searches ( see @xcite for a review ) , but in the present paper we concentrate on the possible impact of the additional singlino - like neutralino on searches for supersymmetry .",
    "this becomes particularly relevant in regions of the nmssm parameter space where the singlino - like neutralino is the lsp @xmath16 : then the singlino - like neutralino appears as one of the final states in every sparticle decay cascade .",
    "however , the couplings of the singlino - like neutralino to all other sparticles are typically very small",
    ". then the branching ratios for decays of all sparticles into the singlino - like lsp @xmath16 are small , with the exception of the nlsp which can decay only into @xmath16 if r - parity is conserved .",
    "hence sparticle decay cascades will evolve as in the mssm , with an additional final decay [ eq:1 ] ^0_2 ^0_1 + x ( if the next - to - lightest neutralino @xmath21 is the next - to - lsp ( nlsp ) which is , however , not necessarily the case in the nmssm ) . depending on the mass difference [ eq:2 ] _ m = m_^0_2 - m_^0_1 , and on the nature of the decay products @xmath22 in ( [ eq:1 ] ) , this additional decay of the nlsp will generally reduce @xmath12 , but will lead to more jets and/or leptons . hence it affects all signatures used in searches for supersymmetry .",
    "a priori , it is not clear how the reduction of @xmath12 and the additional jets and/or leptons affect the efficiencies in the various susy search channels .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the modifications of the efficiencies in the nmssm , for some relevant search channels for supersymmetry ( without and with leptons ) , is the purpose of the present paper .    like in the general mssm , many different scenarios for the soft susy breaking terms are possible in the nmssm .",
    "we found it useful to compare nmssm and mssm scenarios which are as close as possible : similar squark , slepton and gaugino spectra , but with an additional singlino - like lsp in the nmssm .",
    "for convenience , we compare a semi - constrained version of the nmssm ( snmssm ) to the cmssm : we choose the same values for @xmath14 , @xmath3 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 as for some benchmark points of the cmssm , but allow for non - universal singlet - specific soft susy breaking terms @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see the next section ) such that the singlino - like neutralino is the lsp @xmath16 , and the extended higgs sector is in agreement with constraints from lep .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that , for each choice of @xmath14 , @xmath3 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 , we can compare directly the efficiencies in various channels ( after appropriate cuts ) between the cmssm and the snmssm .",
    "this allows to estimate to which extent the additional singlino - like neutralino affects present or future limits or excesses in the @xmath19  plane in comparison to the cmssm as a function of @xmath26 , without the need for a novel analysis of backgrounds and systematic errors .",
    "since we can not study the complete @xmath19  plane , we consider three benchmark points of the cmssm as defined in @xcite , with not too large values of @xmath14 and @xmath3 ( presently not excluded , but of possible future relevance for the lhc at 7  tev c.m .",
    "energy ) . for each point",
    "we vary the nmssm - specific parameters in a domain where the singlino - like neutralino is the lsp ( @xmath16 ) , allowing @xmath26 to vary within the largest possible range complying with constraints from lep2 on the higgs sector .",
    "thus each benchmark point of the cmssm is promoted to a benchmark line in the snmssm .",
    "we then study the ratios @xmath27 of efficiencies snmssm / cmssm for 5 search channels of the atlas jets + missing transverse momentum ( 0 leptons ) analysis in @xcite , and 4 search channels of the atlas multijet + missing transverse momentum ( 0 leptons ) analysis in @xcite , always as function of @xmath26 .",
    "( for our purpose it is useful that the lower bounds in the @xmath19  plane are given for each search channel separately on the web page @xcite . )    actually these ratios @xmath27 always tend towards  1 in the limit @xmath28 : then the complete ( missing ) energy is transferred from @xmath21 to @xmath16 in the decay ( [ eq:1 ] ) , and no energy remains to generate high @xmath13 jets or leptons from the decay products @xmath22 .",
    "however , for larger @xmath26 we find that , after cuts corresponding to the most sensitive 2/3-jet , 0 lepton search channels , the efficiencies in the snmssm can be smaller by a factor @xmath2 as compared to the cmssm ! simultaneously , in the less sensitive multijet search channels the efficiencies in the snmssm would be larger than in the cmssm .    since the additional decay products @xmath22 in ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    "can consist of leptons , it is also interesting to study search channels of the cms multilepton analysis in @xcite for the snmssm . here",
    ", however , the corresponding cmssm efficiencies are so small that it is not meaningful to give ratios of efficiencies snmssm / cmssm ; hence we give estimates for absolute signal cross sections ( production cross sections @xmath29 efficiencies ) for those values of @xmath26 which correspond to the largest efficiencies .",
    "the absolute signal cross sections allow to estimate the future discovery potential in these channels .",
    "the phenomenologically allowed region in the @xmath19  plane in the snmssm is actually somewhat larger than in the cmssm : small values for @xmath14 would lead to a stau ( @xmath30 ) lsp in the cmssm , while in the snmssm the singlino - like neutralino can be lighter than the @xmath30 even for @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , this scenario is always realised in the fully constrained cnmssm @xcite , where the soft singlet mass term @xmath32 satisfies @xmath33 at the gut scale , and @xmath32 must be small in order to allow for a non - vanishing singlet  vev .",
    "the sparticle decay cascades in the cnmssm are quite peculiar : since the singlino - like lsp couples only very weakly to all mssm - like sparticles , the latter decay first into the @xmath30 nlsp .",
    "only subsequently does the @xmath30 nlsp decay into the singlino - like lsp @xmath16 , leading finally to 2 @xmath34 s in the final state of each sparticle decay chain .",
    "however , the @xmath34 s from the final @xmath35 decay are always quite soft due to the small @xmath36 mass difference .",
    "hence , only the more energetic @xmath34 s from the sparticle  @xmath37 decay constitute a visible particular feature of the cnmssm .",
    "( in the cmssm in the stau - coannihilation region , @xmath34 production from decays into and of the @xmath30 nlsp can also be expected , although not as frequently as in the cnmssm . )    for the lhc at 14  tev c.m .",
    "energy , appropriate cuts for searches for the cnmssm ( and ways to distinguish it from the cmssm ) have been proposed and studied in @xcite . using data from @xmath38  fb@xmath11 of integrated luminosity at the lhc at 7  tev c.m .",
    "energy , @xmath5 channels have been analysed by cms in @xcite .",
    "in what follows , we also perform some analyses of the two cnmssm benchmark points with the lowest values of @xmath3 , defined in @xcite .",
    "( lep bounds on the higgs sector imply @xmath39  gev in the cnmssm @xcite . ) as done for the comparison of the snmssm with the cmssm , we study the ratios of efficiencies for 5 search channels of the atlas jets + missing transverse momentum ( 0 leptons ) analysis in @xcite ( using similar realistic cmssm points with small , but non - vanishing values of @xmath14 , which are not excluded by present searches ) . in these search channels , the efficiencies in the cnmssm and the cmssm turn out to be quite similar . in addition",
    "we give estimates for absolute signal cross sections for 4 search channels of the cms multilepton analysis in @xcite and the cms @xmath5 channels @xcite .",
    "the corresponding efficiencies in the cmssm would be very small , which could allow to distinguish these models in the future .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows : in the next section we discuss the nmssm with a singlino - like neutralino , define 3 different benchmark lines of the snmssm , and 2 benchmark points of the cnmssm . in section  3",
    "we describe the tools used for our monte carlo study , and the cuts used for the atlas / cms search channels .",
    "section  4 contains our main results . for each of the 3 benchmark lines of the snmssm",
    ", we present first the branching ratios for the decay ( [ eq:1 ] ) into the additional final states @xmath22 as function of @xmath26 .",
    "we then give the ratios of efficiencies snmssm / cmssm for different supersymmetry search channels used by atlas , and estimates for the signal cross sections for 4 search channels of the cms multilepton analysis for values of @xmath26 corresponding to the largest efficiencies .",
    "for the cnmssm points we provide , in addition , estimates for absolute signal cross sections for the cms @xmath5 channels .",
    "conclusions and an outlook are presented in section  5 .",
    "the nmssm differs from the mssm due to the presence of the gauge singlet superfield @xmath20 . in the simplest realisation of the nmssm , the higgs mass term @xmath40 in the mssm superpotential @xmath41",
    "is replaced by the coupling @xmath42 of @xmath20 to @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and a self - coupling @xmath45 .",
    "hence , in this version the superpotential @xmath46 is scale invariant , and given by : [ eq:3 ] w_nmssm = s h_uh_d + s^3 +  , where the dots denote the yukawa couplings of @xmath43 and @xmath44 to the quarks and leptons as in the mssm .",
    "once the scalar component of @xmath20 develops a vev @xmath47 , the first term in @xmath46 generates an effective @xmath8-term with [ eq:4 ] _",
    "the nmssm - specific soft susy breaking terms consist of a mass term for the scalar components of @xmath20 , and trilinear interactions associated to the terms in @xmath46 : [ eq:5 ] -l_nmssm^soft = m_s^2 |s|^2 + ( a _ h_u h_d s + a _ s^3 )  + .",
    "the neutral cp - even higgs sector contains 3 states @xmath48 , which are mixtures of the cp - even components of the superfields @xmath43 , @xmath49 and @xmath20 .",
    "their masses are described by a @xmath50 mass matrix @xmath51 .",
    "the neutral cp - odd higgs sector contains 2 physical states @xmath52 , whose masses are described by a @xmath53 mass matrix @xmath54 . in the neutralino sector",
    "we have 5 states @xmath55 , which are mixtures of the bino @xmath56 , the neutral wino @xmath57 , the neutral higgsinos from the superfields @xmath58 and @xmath44 , and the singlino from the superfield @xmath20 .",
    "their masses are described by a @xmath59 mass matrix @xmath60 .",
    "subsequently , it is of interest to consider the singlet - like components of these mass matrices ( given in @xcite ) , for simplicity in the typical range @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are the vevs of @xmath63 , @xmath64 : [ eq:6 ] m^2_h33 ~s(a_+ 4 s ) , [ eq:7 ] m^2_a22 ~-3s a _ , [ eq:8 ] m_^055 = 2 s . from the above one easily derives [ eq:9 ] m^2_^055 ~m^2_h33 + ^2_a22 . since both matrix elements @xmath65 and @xmath66 must be positive , one can conclude that none of them can be large if @xmath67 is small , and notably that @xmath68 .    in general ,",
    "these matrix elements differ from the physical masses due to mixing effects",
    ". however , the mixing angles are small for small off - diagonal singlet - doublet matrix elements ( which are proportional to @xmath42 ) or large mass differences , and for not too large @xmath42 the physical masses in the singlet sector are quite close to the above expressions . hence",
    ", a light singlet - like neutralino is always accompanied by a lighter singlet - like cp - even higgs boson , and the singlet - like cp - odd higgs boson is maximally @xmath69 times as heavy as the singlet - like neutralino , but typically lighter .",
    "this has important consequences for the possible final states @xmath22 in the decay ( [ eq:1 ] ) , where these higgs states are often kinematically allowed and constitute possible 2-body decay channels ( @xmath70 or @xmath71 where the index @xmath9 denotes a mostly singlet - like state ) of the bino - like neutralino  @xmath72 .",
    "these considerations are valid for the general nmssm with a scale invariant superpotential .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we consider subsequently the semi - constrained snmssm where the non - singlet scalar masses , non - singlet trilinear couplings and gaugino masses are universal at the gut scale with values denoted by @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the remaining parameters @xmath42 , @xmath73 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the snmssm are chosen as follows : first , we choose a small value for @xmath42 , implying that the singlet - like higgs bosons and the singlino - like neutralino couple only weakly to all other particles and sparticles .",
    "then the light singlet - like cp - even higgs boson is compatible with lep constraints ( due to its small coupling to the @xmath74 boson ) , and the choice of the snmssm specific parameters has little impact on the mssm - like higgs and sparticle spectrum .",
    "this ensures that the differences of the efficiencies with respect to the cmssm are only due to the presence of the singlino - like neutralino , and not due to modifications of e.g. the higgsino and/or higgs spectra : the mssm - like parameters @xmath8 and @xmath75 are kept fixed , which determines implicitely the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the snmssm .",
    "( fixing @xmath76 for fixed @xmath42 implies from ( [ eq:4 ] ) that the vev @xmath47 is fixed as well . )",
    "then we vary @xmath73 and @xmath25 such that the singlino - like neutralino mass ( [ eq:8 ] ) is below the bino - like neutralino mass , and the matrix elements ( [ eq:6 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) remain positive .",
    "positive singlet - like higgs masses compatible with lep constraints imply actually lower bounds on the singlino - like neutralino mass , but these lower bounds still allow for @xmath26 to vary over a wide range .    as in the cmssm",
    ", the dark matter relic density does not generally comply with the wmap bounds for generic points in the snmssm @xmath77  plane , being too large for a singlino - like lsp .",
    "as in @xcite , one could assume a deviation from standard big - bang cosmology to reduce the relic density , or a small r - parity violation that renders the lsp unstable .",
    "alternatively , one could modify the parameters in the higgs sector ( and choose a larger value of @xmath42 ) , such that a cp - even or cp - odd s - channel resonance is available for lsp pair annihilation .",
    "such modifications would have little impact on our subsequent results .    as stated in the introduction , we define three benchmark lines in the snmssm for which the values for @xmath14 , @xmath3 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 correspond to three benchmark points in the cmssm defined in @xcite : 10.1.1 , 10.4.1 and 40.2.1 .",
    "these correspond to different ( but not too large ) values of @xmath14 and @xmath3 , with the first number ( 10 or 40 ) denoting the value of @xmath17 . in each case",
    "we fix a small value of @xmath42 , use the cmssm values for @xmath76 and @xmath75 , and vary @xmath73 and @xmath25 such that @xmath78 varies from 0 to a maximal value determined by lep constraints on the higgs sector .",
    "the singlet - like cp - even and cp - odd higgs masses vary somewhat with varying @xmath73 and @xmath25 , but are always small as shown above .",
    "all mssm - like sparticle properties ( notably the squark and gluino masses ) are practically constant along the snmssm benchmark lines .",
    "hence the sparticle production cross sections in the snmssm remain the same as in the cmssm by construction ; these are not affected by the additional singlino - like neutralino ( or higgs ) states .    in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] we indicate the most relevant properties of the three benchmark lines : first the cmssm - like parameters @xmath14 , @xmath3 , @xmath15 , @xmath17 , @xmath76 and @xmath75 , and the gluino mass @xmath79 , the average squark masses @xmath80 of the first families , and the bino - like neutralino mass @xmath81 ( note that @xmath21 is the nlsp in the snmssm ) .",
    "subsequently we give the ranges of the nmssm - specific parameters , the singlino - like neutralino mass @xmath82 and the sm - like and singlet - like higgs masses @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "( @xmath83 can be larger or smaller than @xmath84 .",
    "the sparticle and higgs spectrum is obtained with the help of the code nmspec @xcite within the version 3.0.2 of nmssmtools @xcite . )",
    "finally we provide the total sparticle production cross section @xmath86 at the 7  tev  lhc as obtained by prospino ( at next - to - leading order ) @xcite .",
    ".parameters , some sparticle and higgs masses , and the total sparticle production cross section for three snmssm benchmark lines corresponding to the cmssm benchmark points 10.1.1 , 10.4.1 and 40.2.1 from @xcite ( masses in gev , rounded to 5  gev accuracy except for @xmath81 and the higgs masses ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( again , for the corresponding cmssm points cmssm.1 and cmssm.2 these signal cross sections are smaller by about a factor 1/20 . ) in @xcite it was estimated that only the lhc at 14  tev c.m .",
    "energy would become sensitive to the cnmssm .",
    "however , combining multilepton and @xmath5 search channels and increasing the integrated luminosity to @xmath87  fb@xmath11 , already the lhc with 7  tev c.m .",
    "energy could become sensitive to the low @xmath3 regime of the cnmssm in the future .",
    "in the nmssm with a singlino - like lsp , it is easy to estimate qualitatively how the signatures for supersymmetry are modified with respect to the mssm : the additional cascade @xmath88 will reduce the missing energy , but will provide additional jets or leptons . in the present paper we studied this issue quantitatively for several benchmark points ( lines in the snmssm ) , considering several supersymmetry search channels . for the considered benchmark lines , we found that the efficiencies can drop by a factor @xmath1 to @xmath89 with respect to the mssm in the most relevant 2/3  jet + missing energy search channels .",
    "this can reduce the present lower bounds on @xmath3 by a factor @xmath90 for parameter regions of the snmssm corresponding to large bino ",
    "singlino mass differences .",
    "the corresponding increase of efficiencies in multijet or multilepton search channels is not strong enough to affect this conclusion .",
    "in addition , we studied the cnmssm , in which the @xmath30 is the nlsp and the @xmath30singlino mass difference is small ( in order to comply with the wmap bounds on the dark matter relic density ) , for the lowest possible values of @xmath3 .",
    "cmssm points with similar values of @xmath14 and @xmath3 are not excluded by present searches .",
    "since the efficiencies in the most relevant 2/3  jet + missing energy channels in the cnmssm turn out to be similar , present searches are not sensitive to the cnmssm either .",
    "however , in the future the signal cross sections in the multilepton and @xmath5 search channels could give hints for the cnmssm already at the lhc with 7  tev c.m .",
    "energy for larger integrated luminosities .",
    "clearly , in a first study of this kind we could only `` scratch the tip of the iceberg '' : first , many more search channels ( different combinations of and cuts on missing transverse energy , jets and leptons ) are studied by the atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "second , we did not cover even the snmssm parameter space completely ; we confined ourselves to regions similar to cmssm benchmark points with moderate ( but not excluded ) values of both @xmath14 and @xmath3 .",
    "as in the mssm , the parameter space of the general nmssm is much larger , and studies similar to those within the general mssm @xcite could reveal more regions in the nmssm to which the susy search channels are less sensitive than in the mssm .",
    "third , more refined studies of efficiencies in various search channels as function of the final states in the additional bino  @xmath0  singlino cascade can help to clarify under which circumstances the nmssm can be distinguished from the mssm independently from the higgs sector .",
    "hence the present study can and should be extended in many different ways .",
