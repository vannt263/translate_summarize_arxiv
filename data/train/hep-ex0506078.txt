    "in the late 80 s , some theoretical work was dedicated to investigate possible exotic types of nuclear radioactivity , consisting in the emission of light particles such as pions or muons from heavy nuclei @xcite . although the theoretical estimates indicated a larger branching ratio for spontaneous ( or neutron - induced ) muon emission than for pions , the experimental searches were mostly dedicated to the pionic radioactivity @xcite , since the detection conditions were more favourable with the used experimental set - ups .",
    "none of the experiments using heavy radioactive nuclei could prove the existence of the pionic or muonic radioactivities , but some of them may have produced indications in support of these hypotheses @xcite .",
    "some experimental indications for pionic radioactivity come from the interpretation of radioactive super giant halos in crystals @xcite ; such a technique , however , can not give precise information concerning the nature of the source or allow quantitative estimates of branching ratios , lifetimes , etc .",
    "a short review of the theoretical problems and of the experimental results obtained , mostly for the pionic radioactivity , may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "muons or pions could be emitted by nuclei through the decays @xcite :",
    "@xmath16 @xmath17 where , for reasons of energy and momentum conservation , the number of fragments @xmath18 is @xmath19 .",
    "the nuclei @xmath20 would yield a sequence of @xmath21 decays leading finally to stable nuclei with a balanced neutron - proton ratio .    in ref .",
    "@xcite some nuclear charge thresholds for different possible spontaneous particle emission were listed :    @xmath22 ( prompt muon ) for @xmath23    @xmath24 ( prompt pion @xmath25 delayed muon ) for @xmath26    @xmath27 ( prompt muon pairs ) for @xmath28    @xmath29 ( prompt pion pairs @xmath25 delayed muon pairs ) for @xmath30    natural lead is mainly composed by three nuclides : @xmath31pb ( 24.1% ) , @xmath32pb ( 22.1% ) and @xmath33pb ( 52.4% ) .",
    "they are stable nuclides , but the channels @xmath34 and @xmath35 are energetically allowed .    the spontaneous or neutron induced fission of pb has never been observed .",
    "nevertheless , the decay into a lepton - antilepton pair ( muon and neutrino ) or into a quark - antiquark pair ( forming a pion ) could enhance the probability that the remaining `` hyper - cold '' nuclear state be unstable @xcite .",
    "a search for a pb muonic decay can be made as a byproduct of the opera experiment @xcite .",
    "uranium or thorium could be used in the future ; such possible experiments would benefit from the results of an initial search using lead .    in the hypothesis of the decays ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] )",
    ", the fission fragments would remain nearly at rest ; most of the available energy would be used to produce the @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 ) and the kinetic energies of @xmath36 and @xmath38 ( or @xmath37 ) .    the total kinetic energy @xmath39 in a decay @xmath40 assuming close values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( symmetric fission ) , is about 30 mev for negative muons and about 20 mev for positive muons . considering that the associated muon neutrino takes away a sizable fraction of this energy , the spectrum of emitted muons could be like in a @xmath43 decay , with an average around @xmath44 mev .",
    "the decay into two fragments would not lead to the best energetic situation since the two resulting nuclei would on the average have large atomic mass and too large neutron numbers .",
    "decays into more than two nuclear fragments would lead to more energetic muons ; at the moment there are no estimates available for such decays .",
    "there is only one experiment that published upper limits for exotic decays of pb @xcite .",
    "the experiment used 123 g of natural lead , obtaining a @xmath45 c.l .",
    "upper limit on the @xmath46 counting rate of @xmath47 s@xmath48 , for a total counting time of 109 hours .",
    "the same authors searched also for pionic emission from uranium , and reported a @xmath45 c.l .",
    "upper limit for @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the width of the spontaneous decay fission . using @xmath51u and @xmath52cf they obtained upper limits of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "a search for spontaneous emission of both muons and pions from @xmath52cf yielded upper limits for the ratio @xmath55 in the range @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "there are no experimental limits for muonic radioactivity .    in the following",
    "we describe a possible search for muonic radioactivity of lead nuclei and we discuss the experimental set - up , the results of a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation giving estimates of the geometric efficiencies , a description of possible backgrounds and the reachable limits .",
    "we propose to perform an experimental search for muonic radioactivity from lead nuclei in the low background conditions offered by the gran sasso underground laboratory ( lngs ) .",
    "the very low cosmic muon flux and the low natural radioactivity of the rock in the experimental halls of the lngs provide unique conditions , allowing a potential discovery , or at least to establish a very good upper limit for this exotic decay process .",
    "a detailed description of the different background sources is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] .",
    "this search could be a by - product of the opera experiment @xcite presently under construction at lngs .",
    "opera is a hybrid long - baseline neutrino experiment , aimed to the direct observation of @xmath57 appearance from @xmath58 oscillations in the cern - gran sasso @xmath38 beam .",
    "the detector is made of 2 supermodules , each with a massive lead / nuclear emulsion target , electronic detectors and a magnetic spectrometer .",
    "nuclear emulsions are used as high resolution ( @xmath59 m ) tracking devices for the direct detection of the decay of the @xmath60 leptons produced in the charged current @xmath57 interactions with the target .    the opera base element ( `` brick '' )",
    "is composed of 56 lead sheets ( 1 mm thick ) interleaved with 2 nuclear emulsion sheets ( 43 @xmath36 m thick ) on both sides of a 200 @xmath36 m thick plastic base .",
    "this sequence is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ecc ] .",
    "the area of each sheet is @xmath61 cm@xmath3 .",
    "the opera lead bricks ( each containing a mass of 8.23 kg of pb ) could allow an experimental search for muon emission from lead , with exposures of several months . their analyses with the fast automatic optical microscopes",
    "@xcite would establish the local background contributions and validate the analysis procedures .",
    "a preliminary test using a `` small '' brick composed of 22 lead sheets and 21 recently refreshed nuclear emulsion sheets was started at the end of march 2005 .",
    "as the background rejection / reduction ( see sect . [",
    "sec : background ] ) is a crucial point for this search , the detectors are surrounded on all sides by a shield , making a closed box structure similar to those used in experiments for dark matter and for neutrinoless double beta decay searches .",
    "the shield is composed of an inner layer 5 cm thick of very pure copper followed by 15 cm of very low activity lead mev photons , which could produce electrons mimicking the searched events . ] .",
    "the third and last layer of the shield is a 3 cm thick polyethylene , in order to absorb neutrons .",
    "a scheme of the installed shield , with the dimensions for containing 5 opera bricks , is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : schermo ] . the set - up",
    "is located in the emulsion storage room , in hall b of the gran sasso laboratory .",
    "the radon reduction is obtained with a ventilation system due to fresh air forced circulation .",
    "the mean range of 15 mev muons in lead is about 1.5 mm , so most of the possibly produced muons could be detected in the two layers of emulsion close to the pb sheet `` source '' ; depending on the angle of emission and on the location of the decay point , some of them could also be detected by the next emulsion sheets .",
    "it is clear that thinner lead sheets would allow the emitted muons to loose a lower fraction of their energy to escape from the lead and to cross more emulsion layers .",
    "they would also yield a higher detection efficiency .",
    "a mc simulation program was implemented to estimate the occurrence of different event topologies .",
    "the simulation is based on the geant3 @xcite package applied to the opera lead / emulsion set - up . at this point",
    "it does not include the complete detector response and does not estimate the real event reconstruction efficiencies .",
    "the simulation reproduces one complete opera brick , where muons of different energies ( see the first column of table [ tab : mu ] ) originate in random positions in the lead sheets .",
    "the initial muon directions are isotropically generated .",
    "we assumed different definitions for a candidate event , requiring that the muon crosses at least : @xmath34 one single emulsion layer , @xmath35 two emulsion layers ( near the same base ) , and @xmath63 three emulsion layers ( and thus also a lead plate , which would allow a better identification using the measured energy loss ) .",
    "we also requested the detection of the decay positron or electron in at least @xmath64 two , @xmath65 three , or @xmath66 five emulsion layers , together with the muon detection .",

    "it may be possible to require only 2 emulsion films crossed by a muon to reconstruct its track .",

    "@xmath34 cosmic ray ( cr ) muons reaching from above the lngs underground labs ( 3700 hg / cm@xmath3 average rock cover ) are @xmath89 muon / h / m@xmath3 @xcite ; the number of cr muons expected to cross one brick during one year is about 90 , sufficient to improve alignments of the different emulsion layers .",
