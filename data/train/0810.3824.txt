    "there has been a considerable interest in the study of the dynamics of quantum spin systems in the past few decades@xcite , and the calculation of dynamic correlation functions remains a highly nontrivial and real challenging task until now .",
    "some exact results have been obtained for the one - dimensional ( 1-d ) pure quantum spin models , e.g. , the 1-d transverse ising model and the 1-d @xmath4 model@xcite .",
    "recently , more attention has been paid to the investigation of the dynamical behavior of disordered systems@xcite , which can be applied to describe the properties of many materials such as window glass , magnets with frozen - in disorder , etc .. one simple but important example of such systems is the 1-d random transverse ising model ( rtim ) .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the 1-d rtim with the bimodal distribution is studied by florencio and barroto@xcite , and it is found that the dynamics undergoes a crossover from a central peak behavior onto a collective mode one .",
    "recently , we have investigated the effects of gaussian disorder on the dynamics of the 1-d rtim@xcite , and have found that there are two crossovers when the standard deviation of random variables is small and there is no crossover if the value of the standard deviation is large enough . besides , the dynamical behavior of the random - bond transverse ising model with four - spin interactions@xcite and the disordered @xmath4 chain@xcite have been studied .    in the work mentioned above only nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interactions",
    "are considered . to our knowledge",
    ", no related results of disordered quantum spin systems with next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interactions have been reported so far .",
    "however , the work of sen has shown the role of second neighbor interactions on the relaxation in @xmath5 pure quantum spin chains@xcite .",
    "the results show that the dynamical correlation in the nnn transverse ising chain is noticeably different with that of the exactly solvable nn transverse ising chain .",
    "therefore , it is expected that considering additional spin - spin interactions in disordered systems will make some differences in the dynamical process .",
    "our main interest is to investigate the effects of nnn interactions on the dynamics of the 1-d disordered quantum spin systems .",
    "it is well known that the interactions between spins may be complex in real materials . for studying the properties of real systems",
    "theoretically and experimentally , the easy way is to consider a model with only the dominant nn interactions . in this paper",
    ", we consider the 1-d rtim with both nn and nnn interactions .",
    "the 1-d rtim can be used to describe the dynamical property of many condensed - matter systems like the quasi - one - dimensional ferroelectric crystals ( e.g. , pbh@xmath6d@xmath7po@xmath8)@xcite , and the ising spin glass liho@xmath9y@xmath10f@xmath8@xcite .",
    "we investigate the cases that the exchange couplings between spins or transverse fields independently satisfy the bimodal distribution and the gaussian distribution , respectively .",
    "our calculations are based on the method of recurrence relations@xcite which is very powerful in the study of classical and quantum many - body dynamics@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , we also used some reliable approximation schemes such as the so - called gaussian terminator@xcite and the pad approximants .",
    "it is found in both disorder that the central - peak behavior becomes more obvious and the collective - mode behavior becomes weaker when @xmath1 .",
    "we also find that the dynamics of the system is not sensitive to the property of the nnn interaction whether it is ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic .",

    "( [ h ] ) , this model can be reduced to the 1-d rtim@xcite .    the dynamical behavior of classical or quantum many - body systems is conveniently expressed in terms of dynamic correlation functions . in this paper , we are interested in the time - dependent transverse correlation function defined by@xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes an ensemble average followed by an average over the disorder variables .",
