    "one needs to evaluate the maximal fidelity @xmath16 with @xmath17 any considered lu or slocc class of states .",
    "mathematically , these classes are defined as follows : the lu equivalence class of a pure state @xmath18 is given by all states of the form @xmath19 , where the @xmath20 are unitary matrices acting on the @xmath21-th party . the slocc equivalence class of @xmath22 is given by normalized states of the form @xmath23 , where the @xmath24 are invertible matrices @xcite .",
