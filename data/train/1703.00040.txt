    "the liquid - gas phase transition is characterized by latent heat which vanishes at one point of the phase diagram  the critical point . within the mean field approach ,",
    "the lg coexistence curve is well described by the celebrated van der waals equation where the role of the order parameter is played by the difference in densities of liquid and gas ( see in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . formally speaking , however",
    ", neither liquid nor gas can be characterized by symmetry breaking order parameter simply because there is no order in both phases .",
    "absence of any underlying symmetry breaking raises the question about the universality of the transition at the critical point .",
    "the standard conjecture is that this transition belongs to the @xmath3 universality class , that is , of the ising transition ( see in refs .",
    "this question have a straightforward answer for the lattice gas where a direct mapping to ising model exists @xcite .",
    "it is formally possible to consider a free space fluid on a lattice with the spacing being much smaller than any typical distance determining interaction . in this case",
    "the lattice and free space models should be equivalent .",
    "thus , in general , no underlying @xmath3 symmetry can be found in such a lattice .",
    "accordingly , lattice models explicitly violating @xmath3 symmetry have been considered @xcite .",
    "it was further suggested that the asymmetry does not change the @xmath3 universality of the lg criticality , and its role is reduced to mixing of the primary scaling operators which results in the non - analytical corrections to the position of the critical point @xcite .    the conjecture that lg criticality is @xmath3 is closely related to the question about the role of higher order odd terms in the field theory .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lg transition characterized by quite generic two - body interactions in free space can be mapped on a field theory of a continuous scalar field @xmath2 with some effective hamiltonian which , in addition to even terms @xmath4 , contains odd ones @xmath5 .",
    "thus , there is a possibility that higher order odd terms @xmath6 change the universality ( the term @xmath7 can be eliminated by a uniform shift @xmath8 with @xmath9 being some constant ) @xcite .",
    "the analysis @xcite based on the renormalization group ( rg ) approach finds that there is a novel fixed point in dimensions @xmath10 induced by the term @xmath1 , provided , @xmath11 and @xmath7 are tuned to zero .",
    "this result , however , was challenged by the analysis @xcite based on the @xmath12-expansion around @xmath13 showing that all odd operators of higher order are strongly irrelevant at the symmetric fixed point , so that this point is stable with respect to the odd perturbations .",
    "it is important to note that the argument @xcite can not be used in 2d .",
    "thus , the question about the role of the higher odd terms in 2d remains open .",
    "more recently , the analytical solution for the critical exponents of 3d lg transition has been found under quite general assumptions @xcite .",
    "these exponents turn out to be different from the values obtained numerically .",
    "the same method can also be used in 2d and it gives the exponents which are different from the onsager values as well @xcite .",
    "this revitalizes the possibility that the lg criticality is not of @xmath3 class .",
    "the situation with the experiment is not that conclusive .",
    "some early experiments aimed at measuring the critical indices have claimed significant deviations from the 3d ising universality @xcite , while others @xcite find an acceptable agreement with the ising universality , provided the fitting procedure included subcritical corrections ( with several adjustable parameters ) .",
    "the main problem turns out to be due to the gravity which does not allow to approach the critical point close enough so that the corrections can be ignored .",
    "the experiments in microgravity ( see in ref .",
    "@xcite ) did nt improve the situation much .",
    "the lg critical point has been addressed by direct monte carlo simulations . in ref.@xcite",
    "the analysis of 2d lennard - jones fluid has been carried out within the hypothesis of the mixing @xcite , and it has been concluded that the universality of the transition is consistent with the @xmath3 class . however , the maximum size simulated in this work allowed to include only about 400 particles on average , with two relatively small sizes of the simulation box used . under this condition",
    "the applicability of the finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis becomes questionable .",
    "the same approach has been used in 3d @xcite with the conclusion that the 3d lg critical point belongs to the @xmath3 class .",
    "the role of corrections to scaling turns out to be much more important in 3d .",
    "this , in particular , lead to inconsistent values of the @xmath14 exponent deduced from different quantities .",
    "thus , the accuracy of the numerical results do not allow to exclude the non - ising universality @xcite with high confidence .",
    "monte carlo simulations have been also conducted for the model interaction potential  the square well in 3d in ref.@xcite ( see also references there ) .",
    "the analysis was carried out for a set of box sizes from 6 to 18 hard core radii , and the conclusion was reached that the universality of the critical point is consistent with the @xmath3 class .",
    "later , however , a different result has been obtained for lennard - jones potential @xcite  the critical exponent @xmath14 was not consistent with the ising class .",
    "the lg criticality has been also addressed in a series of papers @xcite , where both the critical exponent @xmath14 and the critical histogram were found to be consistent with those of the 3d ising .",
    "[ at this point , however , we should notice that the accuracy in the @xmath14-exponent value does not allow to exclude the non - ising universality @xcite ] .",
    "the approach based on molecular dynamics has been utilized in ref.@xcite and significantly larger sizes have been simulated with the conclusion that the lg criticality in 3d is of ising type .",
    "it is important to note that the methods used to evaluate the critical exponents in refs .",
    "@xcite are strongly dependent on the choice of the values of the critical temperature @xmath15 and pressure @xmath16 ( or density ) .",
    "this introduces significant uncertainties in the exponents . in 3d",
    "the corrections to scaling must also be included .",
    "thus , the fits become multi - parametric which introduces even larger errors . here",
    "we suggest a different approach  based on the so called _ numerical flowgram _ first introduced in ref.@xcite and further developed in ref.@xcite . within this method",
    "a position of the critical point stems as a byproduct of tuning a system into criticality with the help of the binder cumulants .",
    "thus , error in the critical exponents is given essentially by the error of the binder cumulant only .",
    "we apply this method to the lg critical point in 2d .",
    "the role of the @xmath1 term at the critical point of the field model @xmath0 in 2d is addressed as well .",
    "the outcome of our large scale simulations allows to conclude with high certainty that the 2d lg criticality does belong to the ising class because the resulting critical exponents coincide with those of the ising model within error bar of 1% . using the same method we have determined the scaling dimension of the @xmath17 term in the @xmath0 model and",
    "have found that it coincides with that of the linear term ( within 1% of the error ) .",
    "this allows to conjecture that all higher order odd terms are simply equivalent to the linear one @xmath18 at the critical point .",
    "the proposal @xcite of the asymmetric fixed point is based on the assumption that the operator @xmath19 ( present in the @xmath0 field model ) is relevant at the symmetric fixed point in @xmath20 -dimensional space .",
    "then , the symmetric point may become unstable and the system finds another ( asymmetric ) fixed point characterized by critical indices different from those of the ising model @xcite .",
    "the alternative view based on the @xmath21-expansion around @xmath13 renders @xmath22 and all higher terms as ( dangerously ) irrelevant @xcite .",
    "[ this argument , however , can not be used in 2d ] .    here",
    "we will discuss the results of the simulations of the standard model of real field @xmath2 in 2d with the @xmath22 term .",
    "far from the criticality , this term causes system instability which needs to be cut off by a higher order even terms , say , @xmath23 . in reality ,",
    "any even positive term higher than @xmath24 is sufficient . within the paradigm of universality , the critical behavior of the @xmath22",
    "should not be affected by this choice . to simplify the simulations we have selected the model with the potential energy @xmath25 .",
    "then , the partition function defined on a square lattice becomes z = d(-h)_i ( 1+g_5 ^5_i ) , [ z ] with h= -t _ ij _ i _ j + _ i [ a _ i^2 + g_4 _ i^4 ] , [ h ] where the field @xmath26 is defined at a site @xmath27 of the lattice , and the summation @xmath28 runs over nearest neighbor sites ; and @xmath29 are parameters .",

    "it is important to note that we have found no critical point at any finite value of @xmath34  the correlation length was finite for any @xmath35 and below .",
    "thus , we conclude that there is only one critical point  with @xmath36 .",

    "we have found that @xmath40 coincides with the onsager value @xmath41 ( within 1% of the total error ) .",
    "the idea of the flowgram method @xcite is based on constructing the finite size scaling ( fss ) flow by tuning a parameter ( say , @xmath31 ) to have a certain value of some binder cummulant @xmath43 @xcite within its critical range and , then , determining how any quantity @xmath44 of interest plotted vs @xmath43 scales within fss .",

    "thus , in the thermo - limit ( @xmath51 ) the cumulant exhibits a jump from @xmath55 to @xmath56 at exactly @xmath32 because the domain @xmath59 shrinks to zero in accordance with the fss behavior @xmath60 .",
    "this allows to approach the critical point by tuning @xmath43 to the critical range @xmath61 in the progression of growing sizes @xmath45 .",

    "our finding is that it is characterized by onsager value of the critical exponent @xmath115 .",
    "the same method can be used in 3d . however , the analysis is complicated by the low value of the exponent @xmath203 determining correction to scaling .",
    "thus , in order to suppress such corrections within the fss analysis , much larger system sizes should be simulated .",
    "alternatively , the fitting of the rescaling factor @xmath204 should involve two exponents  the main one and @xmath205 .",
    "this introduces significant uncertainty which requires large computational efforts to minimize the contributions of errors from several fitting parameters .    _",

    "<S> critical point of liquid - gas ( lg ) transition does not conform with the paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking because there is no broken symmetry in both phases . </S>",

    "<S> we revisit the conjecture that the lg criticality is that of the ising model . </S>",
    "<S> large scale monte carlo simulations of the lg criticality in 2d free space in combination with the numerical flowgram method give the critical indices agreeing with the onsager values within the error of 1% . the related problem about the role of higher order odd terms in the ( real ) @xmath0 field model is addressed too . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling dimension of the @xmath1 term at criticality is shown to be the same as of the linear one @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the role of all higher order odd terms is simply in generating the linear field operator at the criticality . </S>"
