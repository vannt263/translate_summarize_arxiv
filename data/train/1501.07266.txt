    "it is easy to motivate the study of soft matter systems .",
    "everyday life provides us with the most immediate examples .",
    "when we go shopping , we carry home our groceries in plastic bags made from polymers .",
    "most flat screen displays exploit the switching behavior of liquid crystals in an electric field .",
    "we use solutions of surfactants when we soap ourselves while taking a shower . and finally , a major part of ourselves is actually soft matter , as almost all biological cells are . considering the shear amount of soft matter distributed commercially , research activities in this field naturally extend far beyond purely academic purposes .",
    "it is much less straightforward to give a definite , unambiguous , and precise definition of what the term `` soft matter '' actually means or which states of matter it actually includes .",
    "maybe one should proceed the other way around and explain which materials it _ _",
    "ex__cludes by comparison to common other states of matter .    on the one hand , we interpret the term `` softness '' as a strong response to a comparatively weak force @xcite .",
    "this becomes most illustrative when we compare the elastic behavior of metal solids and ordinary rubbery materials .",
    "the young modulus of a rubber can for example be ten thousand times lower than that of steel @xcite .",
    "i.e.  applying a tensile force to that piece of rubber can stretch it about ten thousand times further than when applying it to a corresponding piece of steel . in general , due to these huge responses to external forces , the observed behavior of soft materials is markedly nonlinear @xcite .    on the other hand , the response of soft matter systems to external stimuli is generally comparatively slow @xcite .",
    "the relaxation times in polymers can be hours or days ( or even more ) @xcite , whereas it takes nanoseconds in simple liquids @xcite .",
    "it is therefore easy to drive and maintain the systems out of equilibrium , and non - equilibrium effects play a central role in the study of soft materials @xcite .",
    "one reason for these properties is the size of the building blocks @xcite .",
    "these sizes typically fall into the range of several nanometers up to about a hundred micrometers .",
    "some examples together with a rough classification of the possible associated dimensions are schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_lengths ] . clearly , small rod - like liquid crystalline molecules like paa with a length of about two nanometers are on the lower end @xcite .",
    "colloids , i.e.  mesoscopic particles stabilized in a permanent dispersion , cover a broad range of the considered sizes by definition @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "a rubber made of sufficiently chemically crosslinked polymer chains can actually be considered as one giant molecule and reach macroscopic dimensions @xcite . at this point a strict definition via the size of the constituents becomes more involved .",
    "nevertheless , we can often say that soft matter building blocks are large enough so that quantum effects can be neglected , but small enough that thermal fluctuations play a significant role @xcite .",
    "for example , most of the elastic behavior of rubbers must be attributed to entropy , i.e.  thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "entropy also supports the stabilization of colloidal dispersions as a complement to the necessary artificial stabilization mechanisms @xcite .",
    "apart from that , the size of the building blocks allows us to use coarse - grained descriptions to characterize their collective physical behavior @xcite .",
    "chemical details can often be neglected , which leads to a certain degree of `` universality '' in the characterization .",
    "this point of view got particularly famous in the field of polymer physics @xcite .",
    "finally , the size of the constituents makes it possible to arrange different or even antagonistic properties on one building block .",
    "some examples are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_lengths ] . these are block copolymers , where chemically different connected parts of the molecules tend to micro - phase separate into regular spatial textures @xcite ; surfactant molecules composed of hydrophobic ( `` water - fearing '' ) and hydrophilic ( `` water - loving '' ) parts that self - assemble for instance into bilayer membranes and vesicles in an aqueous environment @xcite ; and colloidal janus particles @xcite that can form finite clusters or regular lattices @xcite .    with all these facts in mind , it is not surprising that the rheological behavior of such systems is relatively complex when compared to simple liquids @xcite .",
    "many soft matter systems are therefore also classified as `` complex fluids '' .",
    "sometimes the terms `` soft matter '' and `` complex fluids '' are even used interchangeably @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we will concentrate on soft matter systems out of their equilibrium ground state .",
    "it is impossible to cover all aspects and areas of this subfield , which was expanding so rapidly over the past decades .",
    "instead , we will mainly focus on typical representatives in each part and embed these examples into the broader context .",
    "roughly , we will increase the degree of activation that leads to non - equilibrium states through the subsequent sections .",
    "first , we consider the switching or tuning of the states of soft matter systems by external fields .",
    "for example , as noted above , in display devices the orientation of the optical axis in liquid crystals is switched by external electric fields . through a static external field ,",
    "the system is forced out of its initial equilibrium ground state .",
    "however , it can reach a new static equilibrium state in the presence of the external field .",
    "[ mod_intro ] we will mainly concentrate on liquid crystalline as well as superparamagnetic or ferromagnetic gels and elastomers , the optical and mechanical properties of which can be tuned by external fields .",
    "they can serve as soft actuators , and even their possible role as `` artificial muscles '' was pointed out .",
    "next , we focus on systems permanently driven out of equilibrium by steady external shear flows .",
    "a brief account of the rheological behavior of liquid crystals and block copolymers is included .",
    "coming back to the introductory cases mentioned above , an example situation from everyday life would be soap or body lotion while we are spreading it on our skin .",
    "related to this topic , we address the progress made on the dynamics of vesicles when driven by an external shear flow .",
    "the broadest section is devoted to the recently exploding field of `` active '' soft matter systems .",
    "we understand the word `` active '' in the sense that individual building blocks have a sort of propulsion mechanism , which leads to motion .",
    "crawling cells or swimming bacteria can run this mechanism for instance by consuming fuel or food , whereas colloidal particles can self - propel via self - phoretic effects .",
    "in general , a key point is that the direction of motion is not prescribed from outside .",
    "these ingredients lead to new and fascinating properties of the individual constituents and when they collectively act together .",
    "there is a significant overlap between the fields of soft matter and biological physics in this area .",
    "finally , a short summary is appended .",
    "we conclude by giving a brief impression of the current state of the field and its evolution .",
    "by `` tuning '' we understand an adjustment of the material properties to a state that serves the current purpose or convenience .",
    "the crucial point with the soft matter systems introduced below comes with the non - invasive way of this adjustment .",
    "an external field is applied to the closed cell or piece of material to achieve the new setting . in general , a static external field can force the system to acquire a new static equilibrium state in the presence of the field . if the external field is increased or decreased in small steps , after each adjustment the system finds itself in a weakly non - equilibrium situation .",
    "it has to find the new equilibrium state in the presence of the switched external field .",
    "frequently , this process can be described by simple relaxation dynamics following the minimum of the modified free energy landscape .",
    "if the external field is adjusted slowly enough , a quasi - static switching can often be achieved , avoiding genuinely non - equilibrium situations .",
    "if our focus is on the process of conversion of external field energy to reach a new state of the system , we may speak of `` actuation '' .      as a starting point ,",
    "let us briefly recall the well - known fredericksz transition in nematic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "this transition can be induced from outside , for instance by applying an external electric field . as will be explained in more detail below ,",
    "it involves a collective reorientation on the molecular level , changing the optical birefringence properties of a sample cell . in this way",
    ", the light transmittance of the cell can be reversibly tuned from outside . in the most illustrative case ,",
    "the liquid crystalline building blocks are small rod - like organic molecules . the molecular structure of one characteristic example , namely paa ,",
    "was depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_lengths ] .",
    "it shows the typical dimensions , which in this case are about two nanometers in length and about half a nanometer in thickness @xcite . at high enough temperatures ,",
    "the material is in an isotropic disordered liquid state as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_lc - phases ]  ( a ) .",
    "the system does not feature any long - ranged positional nor orientational order of the constituents .",
    "it behaves in an isotropic way .",
    "in contrast to that , we find both positional and orientational order at low enough temperatures when the material forms a crystal . then the molecules are stacked on regular lattice sites and orient their long axis along a common direction , see fig .",
    "[ fig_lc - phases ]  ( d ) . between these two extremes of a disordered liquid and a crystalline solid , liquid crystals feature further intermediate phases , the so - called mesophases .",
    "these liquid crystalline phases show a higher degree of order ( corresponding to a lower degree of symmetry ) than the fluid but a lower degree of order ( corresponding to a higher degree of symmetry ) than the crystal .",
    "for example , in the nematic state , the one that we will refer to in the following , there is no long - ranged positional order .",
    "however , on average , the molecules orient along a common direction , see fig .",
    "[ fig_lc - phases ]  ( b ) . in this way",
    ", the material becomes anisotropic .",
    "smectic states , which we will come back to later in this review , feature a regular stacking in layers , see fig .  [ fig_lc - phases ]  ( c ) .",
    "more precisely , they show a quasi - long - ranged positional order in one spatial dimension .",
    "when the system is in the nematic phase , the building blocks tend to collectively order their long axes along a common direction .",
    "this average orientation is called the nematic director @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "genuinely nematic phases are non - polar , that is the directions @xmath1 and @xmath2 can not be distinguished .",
    "the degree of orientational order is measured by a scalar order parameter @xmath3 where the average @xmath4 is taken over all molecules in the sample , and @xmath5 for each individual molecule measures the angle between its long axis and the average orientation @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain @xmath6 in the disordered isotropic liquid state , and @xmath7 in a perfectly ordered nematic state .",
    "a combined symmetric traceless order parameter tensor @xmath8 can be introduced , which contains both information , the degree of orientational order and the average orientation @xmath0 , @xmath9 here , @xmath10 denotes a dyadic product , @xmath11 is the dimension of space ( usually @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 represents the unity matrix and @xmath14 are used instead of @xmath15 and @xmath8 , respectively . ] .    on the one hand , since @xmath0 corresponds to the average orientation of the ordered molecules , it is an axis of anisotropy .",
    "for example , the dielectric constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 measured parallel and perpendicular to @xmath0 , respectively , generally differ from each other .",
    "let us consider the case in which the dielectric anisotropy @xmath18 is positive , @xmath19",
    ". then a static external electric field @xmath20 tends to orient the director @xmath0 along itself .",
    "this tendency is reflected by a corresponding contribution to the effective thermodynamic potential @xmath21 in this expression , possible constant prefactors due to the system of measure are absorbed into the dielectric anisotropy @xmath22 .",
    "on the other hand , spatial variations of the director , i.e.  spatial distortions , increase the thermodynamic potential and are therefore suppressed .",
    "one way of quantifying this thermodynamic penalty is by contracting the tensor @xmath23 , @xmath24 with @xmath25 another material - dependent parameter in general is replaced by a fourth - rank tensor @xcite . ] .",
    "as an example , the nematic liquid crystal can be confined in a thin cell between two parallel plates as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_lc_frederiks ]",
    ".     tends to orient the nematic molecules and the director in vertical direction ( center ) .",
    "both effects  horizontal alignment due to the boundary conditions and vertical alignment through the external electric field  compete with each other . balancing the two resulting torques",
    "leads to a finite angle of director reorientation with respect to the horizontal direction ( right ) above a non - vanishing critical threshold amplitude of the electric field . ]",
    "the surfaces of the cell can be prepared such that they anchor the orientation of the director , for instance in a parallel way , as indicated on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig_lc_frederiks ] .",
    "this , via eq .",
    "( [ f : dist ] ) , sets a uniform director orientation in the whole cell .",
    "if now an external electric field is switched on with an orientation perpendicular to the cell surfaces , see the center of fig .",
    "[ fig_lc_frederiks ] , it tends to reorient the director and align it parallel to itself as given by eq .",
    "( [ f : elec ] ) . however , via eq .",
    "( [ f : dist ] ) , such a reorientation induces thermodynamically penalized distortions because of the surface anchoring on the plates .",
    "the competition between the two effects leads to a critical electric field amplitude that has to be exceeded for director reorientations to become possible . above this threshold field amplitude ,",
    "director reorientations are induced . from eqs .",
    "( [ f : elec ] ) and ( [ f : dist ] ) this critical field amplitude follows directly as @xmath26 where @xmath11 is the thickness of the cell and the impact of possible electric currents has been neglected . in the new static reoriented state ,",
    "the two effects of the reorienting electric field and the counteracting surface anchoring balance each other .",
    "this is indicated on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig_lc_frederiks ] .",
    "when the electric field is switched off , the director rotates back into its initial state due to the surface anchoring .    in this way",
    ", the anisotropy properties of the presented sample cell can be reversibly tuned from outside .",
    "naturally , this anisotropy in a real sample is connected to optical birefringence .",
    "thus the optical transmission properties of the cell can be reversibly switched and adjusted by the external electric field .",
    "this is the underlying principle extensively used to construct optical display devices that are based on liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "however , the technical realizations today involve much more complicated geometries than the simple fredericksz cell outlined above .",
    "commonly used liquid crystals have relatively low molecular weight and are classified as complex fluids . as suggested by the name , they typically flow away when not maintained by a containing cell",
    ". another promising material would be one that is stable and self - standing without supporting container walls , but still features the optical transmission properties of common liquid crystals .",
    "such materials were actually realized by stepping towards higher molecular weights in the form of liquid crystalline polymers and elastomers .    in general ,",
    "polymers are synthesized by covalently binding together from hundreds up to millions identical molecular repeat units , the so - called monomers . in this way ,",
    "new huge macromolecules are formed @xcite .",
    "different chemical routes for this procedure are available .",
    "the number of monomers on the resulting polymeric molecule defines the degree of polymerization . in the simplest case ,",
    "long linear chain - like molecules are obtained , but several further molecular architectures can be realized .",
    "the simplest theoretical model describing linear polymer chains is the freely - jointed chain model @xcite .",
    "it already gives us enough qualitative insight to understand the discussion below .",
    "in this model , as illustrated in fig .  [ fig_freely - jointed - chain ] , the polymeric molecule is reduced to a chain of @xmath27 straight segments that are linked to each other at their ends .",
    "freely - jointed segments of end - to - end vectors @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) give the positions of the joints .",
    "all segments are of identical length , @xmath32 for all @xmath33 , and their orientations are completely independent of each other .",
    "@xmath34 is the end - to - end vector of the whole polymer chain . ,",
    "width=170 ]    each segment has an identical length @xmath35 much larger than the size of a single monomer .",
    "we denote the positions of the joints between the segments as @xmath30 for @xmath31 , while @xmath36 and @xmath37 give the positions of the two ends of the whole resulting chain , see fig .",
    "[ fig_freely - jointed - chain ] .",
    "the chain is `` freely '' jointed in the sense that each segment orientation is independent of the orientation of all other segments .",
    "thus , for each segment , the probability distribution @xmath38 of its end - to - end vector @xmath28 is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the dirac @xmath41-function .",
    "it serves here to prescribe the length @xmath35 of the segment . in this minimum model , the probability distribution to find a certain chain configuration is simply given by the product of these individual single - segment probability distributions @xmath38 .    on this basis , it is straightforward to determine the probability distribution for the end - to - end vector @xmath34 of the whole chain . for @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath43 obviously , this is of gaussian form .    from a statistical mechanics point of view",
    ", we expect the probability distribution to be of the form @xmath44 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath45 denotes the energy of the chain configuration with end - to - end vector @xmath46 , @xmath47 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath48 the temperature .",
    "comparison with eq .",
    "( [ eq : end - to - end ] ) shows that @xmath49 thus the polymer chain behaves like an elastic spring between its two end points @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in the unstrained state",
    "the length of this spring vanishes .",
    "we find @xmath50 for the magnitude of its elastic constant .    based on this simple model",
    ", we see that polymeric materials show an elastic response .",
    "the important point is that these elastic forces mainly do not origin from an internal energy .",
    "they are mostly entropic in nature .",
    "everything that enters eq .",
    "( [ eq : end - to - end ] ) is the entropy resulting from the single - chain configuration .",
    "the elastic constant in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spring ] ) is set by the temperature @xmath48 .    as a next step",
    ", one would like to obtain an elastic material of macroscopic dimension .",
    "for this purpose , many polymer chains are chemically crosslinked , i.e.  covalently bound , to form one chemical unit . in this way ,",
    "an elastomer or rubber is obtained .",
    "the main source of elasticity is again of entropic origin and referred to as `` rubber elasticity '' @xcite .    to make the connection to the field of liquid crystals ,",
    "first liquid crystalline polymers were synthesized .",
    "two principal architectures are available : on the one hand , liquid crystalline molecules can be part of the polymer backbone chains in liquid crystalline main - chain polymers @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig_mcsc ]  ( a ) ; on the other hand , the liquid crystalline molecules can be attached as side - groups to a polymer backbone in liquid crystalline side - chain polymers @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig_mcsc ]  ( b ) .    .",
    "non - liquid - crystalline parts of the polymer `` backbone '' chains are depicted by the bright strings .",
    "( a ) on the one hand , in main - chain liquid crystalline polymers , the liquid crystalline units are part of the polymer backbones .",
    "( b ) on the other hand , the liquid crystalline units are attached as side groups to the polymer chains in side - chain liquid crystalline polymers .",
    "usually this is achieved via shorter hydrocarbon chains , so - called spacer groups , which here are indicated in darker color . ]",
    "when in a later step such liquid crystalline polymers were chemically crosslinked , rubbery liquid crystalline elastomers were obtained @xcite . in this way",
    ", the properties of liquid crystals and those of elastic rubbers could be combined in one material .",
    "the coupling provides new interesting features as described below .",
    "there are different protocols available to obtain different kinds of liquid crystalline elastomers concerning the nematic orientational alignment in the samples . without special aligning mechanisms",
    "it is natural for nematic bulk materials in general not to feature a globally aligned nematic director .",
    "already for low - molecular - weight liquid crystals , bulk samples in the nematic phase usually appear turbid .",
    "they strongly scatter light @xcite .",
    "the reason are thermal fluctuations in the director orientations . as a consequence , the nematic director is not macroscopically aligned , but continuously varies over space .",
    "additional effort , such as the prescribed alignment on the sample surfaces depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_lc_frederiks ] , is necessary to achieve a global alignment of the director orientation .",
    "naturally , thermal orientational fluctuations also occur in polymeric substances . therefore ,",
    "if during the crosslinking process of synthesizing a liquid crystalline elastomer no special action is taken , polydomain samples are obtained @xcite .",
    "the director in these polydomain materials is not globally uniform in the nematic state but continuously varies over space .",
    "however , protocols to manufacture monodomain samples featuring a macroscopically aligned director are available . for this purpose , during the final crosslinking step of the manufacturing process , the sample must be maintained in the liquid crystalline phase and the director must be homogeneously aligned in the polymer solution . in practice , this was achieved by external magnetic fields @xcite , external electric fields @xcite , aligning boundary conditions @xcite , or stretching a pre - crosslinked sample @xcite . a corresponding memory of the director orientation during crosslinking",
    "is then imprinted into the material during the crosslinking procedure . when the liquid crystalline molecules were reoriented by some external action",
    ", they were observed to rotate back into the memorized orientations after the external influence is switched off again .",
    "this was experimentally verified even for polydomain samples crosslinked in the liquid crystalline state @xcite .",
    "apparently the orientations are stored in the architecture of the polymer network .",
    "the most interesting properties of liquid crystalline elastomers arise from their orientational - deformational coupling .",
    "on the one hand , a mechanical deformation like stretching or compression can tune the state of birefringence and the optical properties .",
    "as one specific example , liquid crystalline elastomers were used to experimentally demonstrate the possibility to construct mirrorless lasers of a wave - length that is tunable by mechanical deformations @xcite .",
    "more in general , it was shown for various different samples that mechanical deformations can reorient the director @xcite .",
    "this is indicated on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig_lc_elastomer ] :        when a nematic liquid crystalline elastomer is stretched perpendicularly to its initial director orientation , a reorientation of the director into the stretching direction can result .",
    "the reorientation process involved a pronounced nonlinearity in the corresponding stress - strain curves @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it was demonstrated that the inverse effect is also within reach experimentally : reorientations of the director can induce mechanical deformations . from an application point of view",
    ", this would allow the construction of soft actuators .",
    "one could use an external electric field to reorient the director , which is transformed into mechanical actuation .",
    "unfortunately , so far the necessary field amplitudes were found to be too high for practical purposes . however , for samples swollen with a common low - molecular - weight ( small - molecule ) liquid crystal , a sizeable amount of so - called electro - mechanical coupling was observed @xcite . in this case",
    "the director can be reoriented by an external electric field , which can result in deformations of up to the lower double - digit per - cent regime .    prestretching a material to the point where director reorientation sets in",
    "may allow to observe the electric - field - induced effect also in conventional non - swollen samples , as outlined theoretically @xcite .",
    "close to this critical point , the reorienting external stretching deformation on the one hand and the imprinted memory that anchors the director on the other hand approximately balance each other .",
    "then a relatively weak additional external mechanical or electric field can result in a comparatively large response in the director orientation .",
    "apart from that , other routes of regulation or actuation were demonstrated experimentally , for example photo- @xcite or temperature - induced @xcite deformations .",
    "possible applications as soft actuators or even `` artificial muscles '' were discussed @xcite .",
    "large length changes of several @xmath51  % were observed for loaded and unloaded samples under reversible heating and cooling through the isotropic - nematic transition @xcite . for many applications ,",
    "however , control parameters different from temperature are more desirable .    on the theoretical side , we mention two principal routes of approach that reproduce the measured nonlinear stress - strain behavior as well as the detected deformations due to director reorientations .",
    "the first one is based on the concept of rubber elasticity @xcite .",
    "it assumes gaussian statistics for the step lengths along the polymer strands @xcite . as a starting point",
    ", it further assumes that the main role of the liquid crystalline building blocks is to introduce an anisotropy direction into these gaussian statistics .",
    "thus , instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq : end - to - end ] ) , the end - to - end vectors of the polymer strands between network points of the polymer mesh are assumed to follow the distorted distribution @xmath52 where @xmath0 again indicates the nematic director , @xmath53 is an anisotropy parameter , @xmath13 indicates the unity matrix , and @xmath54 is an effective length connected to the actual contour lengths of the polymer strands .",
    "open issues concerning this picture are how valid the assumption of the distorted gaussian statistics generally is @xcite , and particularly how the orientational memory influences the statistics .",
    "a different microscopic approach was proposed in the form of randomly crosslinked anisotropically interacting rigid dimers @xcite , which reproduces the expressions for the theory of rubber elasticity on a more coarse - grained level .",
    "the second route is macroscopic and based on symmetry arguments .",
    "it couples the continuum descriptions of liquid crystals and elastic materials @xcite .",
    "we noted above that a memory of the director orientation during synthesis is imprinted into the network structure of the polymer mesh .",
    "one central ingredient to many of the macroscopic studies is therefore the observation that rotations of the director out of its memorized equilibrium orientation cost energy .",
    "such `` relative rotations '' between the director and the polymer network environment are included as additional variables @xcite .",
    "first proposed for small deviations from the initial state , this concept was later generalized to the nonlinear regime @xcite .",
    "it is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_relrot ] .",
    "another example of externally tunable polymeric soft matter systems is given by magnetic gels and elastomers @xcite .",
    "again , these materials combine the features of two different classes of complex fluids : those of ferro- and magnetorheological fluids @xcite with those of crosslinked polymers @xcite .",
    "the systems can be classified as composite magnetic hybrid materials @xcite .",
    "they consist of superparamagnetic or ferromagnetic particles that are embedded in a crosslinked polymer matrix .",
    "depending on the degree of swelling of such a magnetic elastomer with a solvent it may rather be called a magnetic gel @xcite . in the dry state",
    ", the materials can become hard and glass - like @xcite .",
    "different sizes of the embedded magnetic particles , typically in the range of nano- to micrometers @xcite , can lead to qualitatively different material behavior .",
    "if the particles are smaller than ten to fifteen nanometers , the direction of their magnetic moment is not fixed with respect to the particle axes . instead",
    ", thermal fluctuations can lead to a reorientation of the magnetic moment @xcite , which is called nel mechanism . for larger particles , reorientations of the magnetic moments",
    "mainly occur via the brownian or debye mechanism @xcite , i.e.  rigid rotations together with the whole particle .",
    "still larger particles , from around a hundred nanometers , can feature multidomains of internal magnetization @xcite .    in the absence of an embedding polymer matrix ,",
    "suspensions of such magnetic particles in a carrier liquid were stabilized in the form of ferro- and magnetorheological fluids @xcite .",
    "such fluids show properties of high practical relevance @xcite . in particular , their dynamic flow behavior determined by their macroscopic viscosity can be tuned reversibly through an external magnetic field .",
    "this feature , commonly referred to as `` magnetoviscous effect '' , was observed experimentally and explained theoretically @xcite .",
    "it is attributed on the one hand to a hindrance of particle rotations that would reorient the magnetization axes of the particles away from the aligning external magnetic field direction . on the other hand",
    ", it results from the formation of micro - aggregates in the presence of external magnetic fields .",
    "typically , the second contribution , when present , exceeds the first one .",
    "the important point is that the adjustment of the viscosity can be achieved in a non - invasive way reversibly from outside .",
    "we turn back to the presence of an embedding polymer matrix in magnetic gels and elastomers . in analogy to the viscous behavior of magnetic fluids , for magnetic gels and elastomers the resistance to elastic deformations , quantified by the elastic moduli @xcite , was experimentally probed .",
    "it turned out that the elastic moduli can be tuned reversibly from outside by external magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this is one of the most outstanding properties of these materials . from an application point of view , it is for example interesting for the construction of novel externally tunable damping devices @xcite or vibration absorbers @xcite .",
    "the analysis of theoretical minimum models demonstrated that the spatial distribution of the magnetic particles plays a central role and qualitatively determines the nature of this effect @xcite .",
    "it was found that the tensile elastic modulus decreases or increases with increasing amplitude of an external magnetic field applied along the tension axis , depending on the particle arrangement .",
    "for instance , a regular simple - cubic or bcc lattice arrangement of the particle positions implied a decreasing tensile elastic modulus @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that , the modulus increased for an fcc structure @xcite .    to a certain degree",
    ", the particle distribution can in fact be influenced during the synthesis of the materials .",
    "when a strong external magnetic field is applied before and during the crosslinking procedure , the magnetic particles were observed to form chain - like aggregates @xcite .",

    "the differences between the two classes of materials are of course large , already in view of the corresponding length scales . on the one hand , the liquid crystalline molecules are relatively small and can even be part of the polymer backbones in main - chain liquid crystalline elastomers",

    "magnetic elastomers are real composite materials of mesoscopic colloidal magnetic particles embedded in a polymer matrix . here",
    ", the spatial arrangement of the mesoscopic magnetic particles within the elastic matrix can be the source of the orientational memory .",
    "so the mechanism of memorizing may be quite different in the two cases .",
    "nevertheless , based on the similarities in the macroscopic theories , it would be worthwhile to test the materials in those experiments in which the respective other material class features its outstanding properties .",
    "the experience acquired for one of the two material classes may help to guide the way also for the other material class . on the one hand",

    "rather an externally applied electric field would serve to tune the elastic properties .",
    "it would be satisfying to observe a mutual benefit between the two fields of liquid crystalline elastomers and magnetic gels .",
    "moreover , instead of only tuning their properties , the materials could also be utilized as model systems for driven and active soft matter in genuinely non - equilibrium situations .",
    "we mentioned that both liquid crystalline elastomers and magnetic gels can be used as soft actuators by switching an appropriate external field @xcite . in a next step , these materials could be steadily driven by external fields so that they can not reach an equilibrium state any more .",

    "such approaches were used to identify and describe possible mechanisms for the motility of crawling biological cells @xcite .",

    "depending on the magnitude of this parameter , the director can show qualitatively different types of behavior in the shear flow .",
    "on the one hand , for @xmath67 , the director reaches a steady - state orientation within the shear plane @xcite .",

    "director tumbling was also observed and discussed for mixtures of liquid crystals @xcite and for liquid crystalline polymers @xcite .",

    "an illustrative example are block copolymer melts or solutions .",
    "to understand the situation in block copolymer melts , it is instructive to recall the problem of mixing of two polymers of a different kind .",
    "this scenario is addressed by the flory - huggins theory @xcite . for low - molecular - weight liquids , a spontaneous mixing is usually driven by a gain in translational entropy : each molecule is now provided with the extended volume of the whole mixture , not only with the one of its initial single component liquid . in polymers , however , this effect is strongly reduced .",
    "the monomers are chemically trapped in the polymer chains .",
    "only each polymer chain as a whole can increase its translational entropy .",
    "therefore the gain in translational entropy under mixing is significantly lower than for low - molecular - weight liquids .",
    "instead , the inter - species interactions between the monomers of different kinds in comparison to the intra - species interactions between monomers of the same kind determine whether the polymers mix or form two separated phases . in most cases",
    ", this competition favors the separated state .",
    "most pairs of polymers do not form homogeneous mixtures at ambient temperatures @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes interesting in block copolymers . here ,",
    "the different polymer chains that tend to demix under the previous conditions are combined into one molecule .",
    "for example , a diblock copolymer chain is composed of two chains of chemically different polymers that are covalently bound to each other at one of their ends . due to the covalent bonds between the blocks ,",
    "a macroscopic demixing is not possible for block copolymers .",
    "consequently , demixing can only occur on the length scale of a single block in the form of a micro - phase separation .",
    "these demixed blocks can then arrange into spatially periodic patterns .",
    "depending mostly on temperature and the volume fractions of the two different blocks , lamellar phases , hexagonally arranged cylinders , bcc or fcc ( in solutions ) structures , and more complicated textures are obtained @xcite . for approximately equal volume fractions of the two blocks , a lamellar micro - phase separated state emerges .",

    "[ fig_lengths ] .",
    "patterns expected for two - dimensional arrangements of linear diblock copolymers are depicted in fig .",

    "when such materials are exposed to shear , an orientation of the periodic structures with respect to the shear velocity and its gradient has been observed in numerous experimental studies @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_linear - shear - flow ] for the shear geometry .",
    "the most illustrative example is the one of lamellar layered textures @xcite . for a simple planar linear shear flow , three principal orientations of the lamellae",

    "[ fig_bcp_shear ] :        a `` parallel '' orientation with the lamellae normals parallel to the direction of the shear gradient ; a `` transverse '' orientation with the lamellae normals parallel to the direction of the shear flow ; and a `` perpendicular '' orientation with the lamellae normals perpendicular to the two previous cases , i.e.  parallel to the vorticity direction .",
    "interestingly , when a steady linear shear flow was applied to a lamellar block copolymer sample , the signature of the transverse orientation was observed at low shear rates @xcite .",
    "this is surprising because it leads to a significant distortion of the lamellar layers .",
    "switching to higher shear rates , a reorientation process occurred with the layer normals now lying in the plane spanned by the directions of the shear gradient and the vorticity @xcite .",
    "this implies a combination between the parallel and the perpendicular alignment , which was also observed in other studies @xcite .",
    "however , the steady shear could not induce a perfect reorientation .",
    "even more , the steady shear led to defects in previously well - aligned lamellar samples for example in the form of focal conical textures @xcite .",
    "it turned out that large - amplitude oscillatory shear was much more effective to align these samples than steady shear flow .",
    "thus the orientational effects of oscillatory shear were studied extensively .    for large - amplitude oscillatory shear ,",
    "reorientation transitions in lamellar phases were observed by varying the shear frequency or the shear amplitude @xcite .",
    "even a `` double - flip '' reorientation process can be found for increasing shear frequency . at low frequencies ,",

    "the traveling single crystal can break up into different domains , or the crystalline lattice structure can vanish altogether .",
    "the stability of different lattice structures under hydrodynamic interactions was analyzed @xcite .",
    "recently , it became clear from theoretical and numerical investigations that hydrodynamic far - field and near - field interactions can differ in their influence on the orientational order and stability of the suspension .",

    "most of these studies were performed using yet another swimmer model called `` squirmer '' @xcite : a non - vanishing flow field is prescribed as a boundary condition for the surrounding fluid on the surface of each swimmer ; the swimmers themselves are often considered as rigid objects , but the non - vanishing surface flow drives them through the liquid environment .",

    "experimentally , the shear geometry could be realized by placing self - propelling droplets on the surface of a liquid @xcite that is confined between two parallel counterpropagating walls .",
    "the situation gets even more complex , when an additional active rotational spinning of the particle is considered in the shear flow @xcite . in this case ,",
    "active spinning with the same sense of rotation as the externally imposed flow field must be distinguished from active spinning with the opposite sense . when the active and the externally imposed rotations counteract and balance each other , a kind of active straight trajectory is recovered .",
    "other types of observed dynamics are periodic , quasi - periodic , different kinds of cycloidal and undulated cycloidal , different kinds of winding , as well as different kinds of chaotic motions .",
    "to summarize the situation , we can say that the additional degrees of freedom arising from the deformability lead to quite complex dynamics , even for isolated active particles . combining deformability , active propulsion , active rotation , and the various types of external influences  in our example the imposed shear flow  opens the way to a nearly unbounded number of dynamical states .      at the end of this review",
    ", we now reach the uppermost spring of our ladder of complexity in the field of active systems . by construction",
    "this is a highly non - trivial topic and we can only touch the surface of it in the present framework .",
    "the main question that needs to be answered in this context is how much the characterization of each of the following systems can be simplified .",
    "the physicist s goal is naturally to map the animal behavior onto a minimum model that captures the central ingredients but can still be evaluated efficiently .",
    "how will this work for living creatures that have their own mind and make their own decisions ?    already for microorganisms the situation is quite difficult @xcite .",
    "for example , reversals or changes in their migration directions are often observed @xcite .",
    "the latter can lead to a type of run - and - tumble motion @xcite . on the one hand",
    ", this behavior may result from the complicated propulsion mechanism @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it can be the manifestation of an `` active decision '' @xcite .",
    "if the change in migration direction occurs in response to an external stimulus , the reaction is generally referred to as `` taxis '' or `` tactic '' behavior .",
    "for instance , microorganisms can react in a chemotactic way when they detect chemicals that indicate nutrition , or they use chemicals for communication between each other without physical contact @xcite .",
    "further examples concern the reaction to light ( phototaxis ) @xcite , gravitation ( gravitaxis ) @xcite , flow fields ( rheotaxis ) @xcite , adhesion gradients ( haptotaxis ) @xcite , and other external stimuli .",
    "nevertheless , aspects of the collective behavior can often be described by simple particle descriptions in the form of extended vicsek approaches @xcite or by minimum continuum models @xcite .",
    "grasshoppers ( or locusts ) form a class of insects the collective dynamics of which has attracted attention for at least one reason : cannibalism is observed for these insects and seems to influence their individual and collective behavior @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "an individual tries to rush after grasshoppers ahead of itself . on the other hand , it tries to flee from individuals behind itself .",
    "this was demonstrated by restricting the visual field through paintings on part of their eyes @xcite . a restricted ability to detect approaching members in a group reduces motion and promotes cannibalism @xcite , which indicates that cannibalism supports migration .",
    "the situation was modeled in a pursuit - escape approach by finite - size random walkers that experience friction with the substrate and social interactions @xcite : other individuals moving away in the front are hunted after , whereas they are fled from if they approach from behind . in particular , the pursuit interaction tends to increase the orientational order in the collective motion .",
    "it increases the mean migration speed , which is also the case for the escape interaction at higher densities .",
    "a further study analyzed the radial distribution of other grasshoppers around one individual @xcite .",
    "it revealed an isotropic shape in contrast to the anisotropic one obtained from minimum pursuit - escape approaches .",
    "the situation might still be more complex .",
    "another group of animals repeatedly studied in the context of collective motion are fish .",
    "data can be obtained by video - tracking the individuals of a swarm in artificial water tanks @xcite .",
    "it was observed that fish swarms were of smaller size when food sources were detected @xcite and of larger size in reaction to predator attacks @xcite .",
    "the swarms are generally elongated and denser at the front than at the back @xcite . increasing the mean density of fish in a container , a transition to cooperative collective motion",
    "could be detected at a threshold density @xcite similarly to the predictions of the vicsek model @xcite .",
    "however , the interaction rules deduced for individuals appear to be quite different from those assumed in the vicsek model : direct orientational alignment seems to be weak @xcite , interactions are restricted to the one single nearest neighbor @xcite or at least are not a simple average over all pairwise interactions @xcite , and variations of swimming speed are important @xcite . in a recent study ,",
    "three modes of collective swimming motion were identified @xcite : a swarming state of relatively low order , a polarized state , and a milling state of high global rotation .",
    "transitions were frequently observed .",
    "these forms of collective behavior should be compared to the motion of single isolated fish . in the latter case ,",
    "relatively continuous trajectories without sharp bends or kinks were observed , corresponding to persistently turning walkers rather than conventional random walks @xcite .",
    "while the swimming motion of small fish can still be effectively confined to a quasi two - dimensional geometry in the lab , the study of fish and bird swarms in nature must typically consider three - dimensional textures .",
    "an exception are linear string - like and v - shaped arrangements ( skeins ) of , e.g. , migrating geese , the structure and dynamics of which was recorded and analyzed @xcite . to empirically study real three - dimensional flocks of birds , however , new tools had to be developed to effectively reconstruct the individual positions within the swarm from recorded two - dimensional image data @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the observations made for fish , starling swarms were denser at their outer boundary than in the center @xcite without a systematic front - back asymmetry @xcite . a correlation between the density and number of individuals in the swarm could not be identified @xcite . on average ,",
    "the probability to find a nearest - neighboring bird in the direction of motion was markedly depleted compared to other directions @xcite .",
    "maybe most importantly , the interactions between the individuals were observed to follow topological rather than metric rules @xcite : the interactions occur with a fixed number of nearest neighbors instead of all neighbors within a fixed interaction distance .",
    "qualitative differences arise from this subtlety , for example the swarms are more cohesive under predator attacks @xcite . furthermore , in the famous vicsek model @xcite , a change to non - metric topological interactions",
    "renders the order - disorder transition for collective motion continuous , without the emergence of density bands @xcite .",
    "this example demonstrates the importance of intensified recording and comparing to empirical data  a task that is highly non - trivial for such complex systems as animal swarms .",
    "in the above , we took a tour through various subtopics concerning the physics of soft matter out of its equilibrium ground state .",
    "the field of soft matter has grown far too broad for all its aspects to be touched in such a brief account .",
    "only selected issues could be included .",
    "we were guided by two central aspects characteristic for soft matter systems : they typically show large responses to external stimuli ; and they are easily driven out of equilibrium .",
    "the degree of non - equilibrium served to order the different topics , where in each case we considered systems of increasing complexity .",
    "static external fields can switch the state of a system from its initial equilibrium ground state to a new static equilibrium state .",
    "we considered external electric fields that reorient the director in cells of low - molecular - weight liquid crystals as well as in swollen or prestretched liquid crystalline elastomers . in the latter materials ,",
    "also mechanical fields can be applied to change the director orientation .",
    "furthermore , the electric fields can induce mechanical deformations in swollen liquid crystalline elastomers , which makes these materials candidates for the use as soft actuators .",
    "the same is true for ferrogels or magnetic elastomers when they are exposed to external magnetic fields .",
    "apart from that , the external fields can be used to tune the mechanical properties .",
    "for example , the elastic moduli can be reversibly adjusted in a non - invasive way by applying an external field .",
    "after that , we addressed externally imposed shear flows that lead to steady and dynamic states of motion . in such shear flows ,",
    "the director of nematic liquid crystals can be observed to `` flow align '' , i.e.  to take a steady inclination angle with respect to the flow within the shear plane ; it can oscillate in a `` wagging '' motion ; or it can describe continuous full `` tumbling '' rotations . in certain cases , these states can also be observed successively with decreasing shear rate .",
    "orientational effects under shear are further found in bulk - filling , but spatially periodically modulated systems .",
    "we considered the example of micro - phase - separated block copolymer melts or solutions . especially under large - amplitude oscillatory shear , reorientations of the structures with respect to the shear directions occur as a function of the shear rate and amplitude .",
    "furthermore , for localized objects such as vesicles that are composed of closed bilayer membranes a picture similar to the one for the director of nematic liquid crystals emerges under steady shear flow .",
    "the steady state of constant inclination angle is called `` tank - treading '' , with the bilayer membrane running around the interior of the vesicle ; an oscillating inclination angle is referred to as `` swinging '' , `` trembling '' , or `` vacillating breathing '' ; and , again , full rotations occur in the `` tumbling '' mode .",
    "a non - vanishing viscosity contrast between the liquid on the inside and on the outside of the vesicle is necessary to obtain these states successively with decreasing shear rate .",
    "finally , we turned to systems composed of constituents that themselves are considered to be active .",
    "they feature a mechanism of self - propulsion and possibly also of active rotations .",
    "our focus was on the collective non - equilibrium states arising from the interactions between these constituents .",
    "examples are ordered collective motion , traveling density bands , laning , resting and traveling crystals , or non - equilibrium clustering .",
    "we increased the complexity from point - like particles to finitely - sized objects including steric interactions ; from particles propelling with constant velocity to those featuring a constant strength of active drive ; from dry systems to those interacting hydrodynamically ; from rigid particles to those being deformable ; and , eventually , by briefly addressing recent studies on living creatures .",
    "quite remarkably , basic aspects , such as the formation of flocks of individuals that order their migration directions at high enough density , can be found on all levels of complexity .",
    "this supports the idea that it is possible to develop basic underlying concepts and systematic methods to describe also such kinds of genuinely non - equilibrium systems .    as a concluding remark",
    ", we would like to append a central argument in favor of this field .",
    "although often emerging from topics of daily life or biology , many of its subareas are relatively young .",
    "the boundaries are rapidly being pushed forward , thus continuously providing new interesting problems of research . far from equilibrium , i.e.  inherently for active systems , the tools of understanding",
    "still need to be established , although often an intuitive picture can straightforwardly be developed .",
    "therefore , especially for young researchers , soft matter physics provides a promising opportunity in a meanwhile well - recognized environment .",

    "<S> one characteristic feature of soft matter systems is their strong response to external stimuli . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> they are comparatively easily driven out of their ground state and out of equilibrium , which leads to many of their fascinating properties . here , we review illustrative examples . </S>",
    "<S> this review is structured by an increasing distance from the equilibrium ground state . on each level , </S>",
    "<S> examples of increasing degree of complexity are considered . in detail , we first consider systems that are quasi - statically tuned or switched to a new state by applying external fields . </S>",
    "<S> these are common liquid crystals , liquid crystalline elastomers , or ferrogels and magnetic elastomers . </S>",
    "<S> next , we concentrate on systems steadily driven from outside e.g.  by an imposed flow field . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , we review the reaction of nematic liquid crystals , of bulk - filling periodically modulated structures such as block copolymers , and of localized vesicular objects to an imposed shear flow . finally , we focus on systems that are `` active '' and `` self - driven '' . here </S>",
    "<S> our range spans from idealized self - propelled point particles , via sterically interacting particles like granular hoppers , via microswimmers such as self - phoretically driven artificial janus particles or biological microorganisms , via deformable self - propelled particles like droplets , up to the collective behavior of insects , fish , and birds . </S>",
    "<S> as we emphasize , similarities emerge in the features and behavior of systems that at first glance may not necessarily appear related . we thus hope that our overview will further stimulate the search for basic unifying principles underlying the physics of these soft materials out of their equilibrium ground state .    </S>",
