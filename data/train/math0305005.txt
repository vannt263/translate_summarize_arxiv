    "microstructure occurs when the deformation gradient oscillates in space among the @xmath13 to enable the deformation to attain a lower energy than could be attained by a more homogeneous state [ 1,25 ] .",
    "the simplest microstructure is a laminate in which the deformation gradient oscillates between @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 in parallel layers of fine scale , but more complex microstructure is observed in nature and is predicted by the theory [ 2,25 ] .",
    "we have developed numerical methods for the computation of microstructure in martensitic and ferromagnetic crystals and validated these methods by the development of a numerical analysis of microstructure [ 4,6,12,14,16,22,2528 ] .",
    "related results are given in [ 9,10,15,21,24,31,32,34 ] .",
    "for martensitic crystals , we have given error estimates for stable quantities such as nonlinear integrals @xmath17 for smooth functions @xmath18 and for the local volume fractions ( young measure ) of the variants @xmath13 even though pointwise values of the deformation gradient are not stable under mesh refinement .",
    "to model the evolution of metastable states , we have developed a computational model that nucleates the first order phase change since otherwise the crystal would remain stuck in local minima of the energy as the temperature or boundary forces are varied [ 8 ] . our finite element model for the quasi - static evolution of the martensitic phase transformation in a thin film nucleates regions of the high temperature phase during heating and regions of the low temperature phase during cooling .",
