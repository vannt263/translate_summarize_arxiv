    "quantum mechanics can not be described by local hidden - variable ( lhv ) theories .",
    "this is the conclusion of bell s seminal work , in which he derived a strict limit to the strength of correlations achievable by all lhv models that is violated by quantum predictions @xcite .",
    "bell s original inequality did not allow for imperfections and thus it was not accessible to experimental tests .",
    "clauser , horne , shimony and holt ( chsh ) addressed this issue and developed the chsh inequality  @xcite , which allowed for tests in actual experiments . since then a growing number of experiments have been reported ( for examples , see  @xcite ) , and the overwhelming experimental evidence from these tests is in favour of quantum mechanics , ruling out lhv theories . it should be noted that , while no _ loophole - free _ bell test has been performed , the most significant potential loopholes , relating to detection efficiency and space - like separation of the choices of measurements settings , have both separately been closed @xcite .",
    "both bell s inequality and the chsh inequality were formulated for testing the correlations between just two particles . for more than two particles , greenberger , horne and zeilinger ( ghz ) showed  @xcite that a contradiction between lhv theories and quantum mechanics can be seen directly in perfect correlations , as opposed to statistically in imperfect ones . soon thereafter bell - type inequalities for more than two particles were developed @xcite .",
    "quantum predictions can violate such inequalities by an amount increasing exponentially with the particle number @xcite .",
    "all of the aforementioned inequalities are based on the assumption that local realism applies to each individual particle .",
    "two - particle inequalities have been developed which are in conflict with quantum mechanics although they allow restricted , but physically motivated , nonlocal correlations @xcite .",
    "these inequalities have recently been violated experimentally @xcite .",
    "svetlichny showed that even if one allows unrestricted nonlocal correlations between any two of the constituent particles in a three - particle setting one can still find inequalities violated by quantum mechanical predictions @xcite .",
    "the correlations allowed by svetlichny s model are strong enough to maximally violate three - partite inequalities , such as mermin s @xcite , which assume local realism for all particles involved .",
    "a violation of such inequalities therefore can only rule out lhv theories , while a violation of svetlichny s inequality directly rules out a whole class of nonlocal hidden - variable theories @xcite .",
    "svetlichny s work has since been generalized to the case of @xmath2 particles @xcite .",
    "experimental tests have been performed confirming the violation of the mermin inequality @xcite , the mermin - ardehali - belinskii - klyshko ( mabk ) inequality @xcite , and the cluster state inequality developed by scarani et .",
    "for an even number of particles only , a sufficiently large violation of the mabk inequality also rules out partially non - local hidden - variable models @xcite .",
    "the violation of the mabk inequality in @xcite thus confirmed genuine four - particle entanglement and non - locality .",
    "the original svetlichny inequality , however , remains untested .",
    "here , we begin with a brief theoretical description of svetlichny s inequality .",
    "we then experimentally produce high - fidelity three - photon ghz states and characterize them via quantum state tomography @xcite . using these states , modulo standard loopholes @xcite",
    ", we experimentally demonstrate a convincing violation of svetlichny s inequality .",
    "the two assumptions resulting in bell - type inequalities are locality and realism as they were introduced by einstein , podolsky and rosen @xcite .",
    "we first review a straightforward method to derive the chsh inequality from these two assumptions following an argument described by peres @xcite .",
    "pairs of particles are distributed to two distant parties , a and b. party a ( b ) can choose between two measurement settings @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) . for each measurement setting ,",
    "two outcomes , @xmath7 or @xmath8 , are possible .",
    "realism assumes that the measurement outcomes are predetermined by some properties of the system investigated .",
    "these properties are known as hidden variables because they are not necessarily accessible to observation .",
    "the additional assumption of locality requires that the measurement outcomes on side a are independent of the measurement setting on side b , and vice versa .",
    "thus for any given pair of particles the measurement outcomes have predetermined values @xmath9 and @xmath10 on side a and @xmath11 and @xmath12 on side b. these values identically satisfy the relations : @xmath13 if , for example , @xmath14 is averaged over many trials , the absolute value must be smaller than @xmath15 , which results in the chsh inequality @xcite : @xmath16 where the correlation , @xmath17 , is the ensemble average @xmath18 over the product of measurement outcomes @xmath19 and @xmath20 for measurement settings @xmath3 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "this argument can be extended to three particles @xcite .",
    "we will denote the particles as well as the measurement outcomes as @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the measurement settings as @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath22 .",
    "the outcome of each measurement can be @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "if we assume local realism for each of the three particles , then for a given set of three particles the measurement outcomes @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 as well as their primed counterparts will have predetermined values @xmath23 . using ( [ s2 ] ) we find that the following identity must hold : @xmath24 dividing this expression by two , and averaging over many trials yields mermin s inequality @xcite for three particles : @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "now assume that we allow arbitrary ( nonlocal ) correlations between just _ two _ of the particles , say @xmath19 and @xmath20 , while we still assume local realism with respect to the third particle , @xmath21 . in this case",
    "we can not factorize @xmath14 as we did in ( [ s2 ] ) because outcomes for particle @xmath19 might nonlocally depend on the outcomes and/or measurement settings for particle @xmath20 .",
    "however , we can still write @xmath27 where the parentheses are meant as a reminder that these quantities should be regarded as separate and independent quantities",
    ". each of these quantities as well as @xmath21 and @xmath28 must take predetermined values @xmath23 because we assume local realism with respect to the third particle .",
    "this model is strong enough to violate , and reach the algebraic maximum of mermin s inequality ( since @xmath29 can be @xmath30 ) .",
    "thus no experimental violation of mermin s inequality can rule out this restricted nonlocal hidden - variable model .    with this in mind",
    "let us slightly modify our argument to derive svetlichny s inequality . because @xmath29 and @xmath31 are functions of the same four quantities , they are not independent .",
    "for example , whenever one of the two quantities reaches its algebraic maximum @xmath30 , the other one will be @xmath32 . as a result",
    "the following identity holds :    @xmath33    averaging over many trials yields the svetlichny inequality : @xmath34 where we refer to @xmath35 as the svetlichny parameter .",
    "it is remarkable that , although we started out by allowing nonlocal correlations between particles @xmath19 and @xmath20 while @xmath21 is local , one gets an expression identical to ( [ svetlichny ] ) if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are nonlocally correlated while @xmath19 is local , or if @xmath19 and @xmath21 are nonlocally correlated while @xmath20 is local .",
    "every hidden - variable model that allows for nonlocal correlations between any two particles but not between all three can be seen as a probabilistic combination of models where the partition of the particles between nonlocal and local is made one or the other way .",
    "all of these models fulfill the svetlichny inequality @xcite .",
    "it was shown by svetlichny that his inequality can be violated by quantum predictions , and that the maximum violation can be achieved with ghz states .",
    "assume we have a polarization - entangled ghz state @xmath36 , and let our measurement settings all be in the _ xy_-plane of the bloch sphere , i.e.  we can write the corresponding states we project on as @xmath37 .",
    "for example , the measurement settings @xmath3 and @xmath4 for particle @xmath19 correspond to projective measurements on the states @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively . here , the @xmath40 corresponds to the state the particle is projected on if the outcome of the measurement is @xmath23 . for particles @xmath20 and @xmath21 we choose an analogous notation .",
    "then the quantum prediction for the left - hand side of ( [ svetlichny ] ) is @xmath41 with a suitable choice of angles , such as : @xmath42 this results in @xmath43 , which is the maximum violation of svetlichny s inequality achievable with quantum mechanics @xcite .    since any hidden - variable model describing a three - particle state where only two particles are nonlocally correlated has to fulfill the svetlichny inequality",
    ", its violation explicitly rules out this type of nonlocal hidden - variable theory .",
    "our experiment uses a pulsed titanium : sapphire laser ( rep . rate 80mhz , @xmath44 avg .",
    "power , @xmath45 nm center wavelength , @xmath46 nm fwhm bandwidth ) .",
    "we frequency double the near - infrared beam , producing @xmath47mw average power near @xmath48 with a fwhm bandwidth of @xmath49 nm .",
    "this upconverted beam is focused on a pair of orthogonally - oriented @xmath50-barium - borate ( bbo ) nonlinear crystals  @xcite cut for type - i noncollinear degenerate spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) with an external half opening angle of @xmath51 .",
    "the pump polarization is set to @xmath52 such that each pump photon can produce a photon pair either in the first or the second bbo crystal . to compensate for temporal distinguishablity between the pairs created in the first and the second crystal the pump passes through a @xmath53 mm @xmath54-bbo crystal , a @xmath15 mm quartz crystal , and a @xmath55 mm quartz crystal , all cut for maximum birefringence . to compensate the @xmath56 m spatial walk - off between the horizontally and vertically polarized spdc photons observed in one of the output modes",
    ", we insert a @xmath57 mm thick bibo crystal cut at @xmath58 and @xmath59 . for these cut angles",
    "the crystal compensates the transverse walk - off without introducing additional time walk - off .",
    "the photons are subsequently coupled into single - mode fibres .",
    "we label the two corresponding spatial output modes as 1 and 2 , see figure  1(a ) .",
    "fiber polarization controllers ensure that in mode 1 states in the hv basis remain unchanged while in mode 2 we flip the polarization , i.e. , @xmath60 . with this configuration",
    "we achieve a two - photon coincidence rate of @xmath61 and single rates of about @xmath62 and @xmath63 for modes 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the measured contrast of the pairs is @xmath64 in the h / v basis and @xmath65 in the @xmath66 basis when the source is adjusted to produce @xmath67 states .    following the approach in @xcite we use the double - pair emission of the spdc source to produce 3-photon ghz correlations in the interferometer shown in figure  1(b ) .",
    "a four - fold coincidence detection in the four outputs of the interferometer indicates the successful generation of the ghz state . to lowest significant order ,",
    "a four - fold coincidence can only occur if two photons enter the interferometer via the spatial mode 1 , and their two partner photons enter it via mode 2 .",
    "the two photons in input mode 1 impinge on a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) . in order for a four - fold coincidence event to occur",
    "one of them must be h polarized and the other v polarized .",
    "the v photon is reflected at the pbs .",
    "its detection by detector @xmath68 serves as a trigger event .",
    "the h photon passes through the pbs in mode 1 , and a @xmath69 plate oriented at @xmath70 rotates the polarization from @xmath71 to @xmath72 .",
    "the two photons in mode 2 are split at the @xmath73 beam splitter ( bs ) with probability @xmath74 . only in this case",
    "a four - fold coincidence can occur .",
    "the transmitted photon and the @xmath72 polarized photon in mode 1 are overlapped on a pbs . a coincidence detection event in the two output modes of the pbs",
    "can only occur if both photons are transmitted or both are reflected .",
    "if these two possibilities are indistinguishable , hong - ou - mandel interference will occur @xcite . in the reflected mode of the bs",
    "we compensate for a phase shift due to birefringence in the bs by tilting a @xmath75 plate .",
    "a four - fold coincidence detection in the interferometer outputs can only occur if the trigger photon is @xmath76 polarized , and if the other three photons in the modes @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( see figure 1(b ) ) are either @xmath77 or @xmath78 . by tilting a @xmath75 plate in output mode",
    "@xmath19 we adjust the relative phase between these contributions such that a four - fold coincidence event signals a ghz state of the form @xmath79 .    given this state ,",
    "quantum mechanics predicts a maximum violation of svetlichny s inequality if we choose measurements of the form @xmath80 with the angles given in ( [ angles ] ) .",
    "particles @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are identified with photons in the interferometer output modes @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . to test svetlichny s inequality each of the photons has to be measured in two measurement bases , and for each basis there are two possible outcomes , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for each outcome",
    "we have to set the polarization analyzer in the respective mode such that a photon detected after passing through the analyzer corresponds to that outcome .",
    "the svetlichny parameter , @xmath35 ( see ( [ svetlichny ] ) ) , consists of @xmath81 correlations , each of which can be constructed from @xmath81 three - photon polarization measurements for a total of @xmath82 measurements .",
    "each polarization analyzer consists of a @xmath69-plate followed by a @xmath75-plate and then a pbs .",
    "the photons passing the pbss are detected with single - mode fibre - coupled single - photon counting modules ; the coincidence window is @xmath83 .    in order to fully characterize the state produced by our setup we perform quantum state tomography . because all the measurement settings for the svetlichny inequality lie in the _ xy_-plane of the bloch sphere these alone are not tomographically complete . instead of performing an additional run apart from the measurements of the svetlichny settings , we add two additional projective measurements ( @xmath71 and @xmath84 ) for each of the particles , resulting in a total of @xmath85 three - photon polarization measurements .",
    "our set of measurements is now actually tomographically overcomplete , which has been shown to produce better estimates of quantum states @xcite .",
    ".[counts]experimentally - measured counts .",
    "four - fold coincidences for the @xmath85 measurements performed for quantum state tomography . a subset of @xmath82 measured counts were used to test svetlichny s inequality ; these counts are shown in boldface type .",
    "we cycled through all of the measurements @xmath86 times , counting for @xmath87 for each measurement .",
    "the four - fold coincidences given are the result of integrating over all of these cycles . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in our setup the maximum four - fold coincidence rates of @xmath88 and @xmath89 were achieved for the correlations @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "to get statistically significant counts we integrated over @xmath92 per measurement . in order to reduce the negative effects of misalignment of the setup over time we realized this integration by counting for @xmath87 for each of the @xmath85 measurements , then repeating the full cycle of measurements @xmath86 times .",
    "the resulting counts are given in table [ counts ] .",
    "we applied the maximum likelihood technique @xcite to reconstruct the density matrix of our state .",
    "its real and the imaginary part are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the fidelity @xmath93 of the density matrix with the ghz state @xmath94 is @xmath95 .",
    "the errors of quantities derived from the reconstructed density matrix were calculated via a monte carlo simulation , where we used each of the measured counts as the mean of a poissonian distribution . according to these distributions we generated random counts and ran the maximum likelihood algorithm .",
    "this procedure was repeated @xmath96 times , and we report the standard deviation and mean for quantities derived from these reconstructed states .",
