    "liquid foams have a ubiquitous mechanical behavior : depending on the strength of an external applied solicitation , they can exhibit both elastic , plastic or viscous response ( @xcite ) .",
    "this complex behavior is used in many industrial applications ( @xcite ) , like ore flotation , oil extraction , food and cosmetic industry .",
    "liquid foams are also of fundamental interest as models to study complex fluids , since their constitutive item , the bubble , is experimentally easily observable , contrary to colloids or polymers .",
    "the understanding of foam rheology has motivated active research ; a series of seminal studies has first focused on the elastic properties of foams , such as elastic moduli or yield stress ( @xcite ) .",
    "the plasticity of foams originates from topological rearrangements , called t1s ( fig .",
    "[ skeletons]c ) .",
    "this coupling between local rearrangements of constitutive entities and a macroscopic plastic behaviour is a general feature of many materials ( emulsions , pastes , slurries ) , that studies have described generically as soft glassy materials ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the research on the viscous and dissipative properties of foams is rather recent ( @xcite ) .",
    "much effort is currently devoted to integrate elastic , plastic and viscous behaviours in a single constitutive equation ( @xcite ) .",
    "to achieve such a goal , a fine and precise knowledge of the mechanical behavior of the foam is required .",
    "this is the reason why foams are often studied in quasi-2d geometries ( @xcite ) , where foams are confined so that they are only one bubble thick ( confinement either between two parallel plates , between one horizontal plate and the surface of a soap solution , or at the free surface of a soap solution ) .",
    "imaging is easy in these quasi-2d geometries , contrary to an opaque 3d foam .",
    "a classical way to study quasi-2d foams consists in using rheometric flows ( @xcite ) , like simple shear flows ( @xcite ) , which are easy to analyze .",
    "the study of heterogeneous flows is complementary : it is less easy to analyze and to understand , but it enlarges the number of observed effects .",
    "this is the case for example for flows in constrictions ( @xcite ) , or for stokes experiments , i.e. flows around obstacles ( @xcite ) .",
    "we studied extensively stokes experiments for foams , focusing on the effect of the foam on the obstacle : drag ( @xcite ) , lift ( @xcite ) or torque ( @xcite ) .",
    "the variations of these quantities with various control parameters , especially the foam flow rate , illustrate the interplay between elastic , plastic and viscous behavior of the foam . to go beyond these force and torque measurements ,",
    "we revisit here some of these experiments with the complementary approach , studying by local measurements the effect of the presence of an obstacle on a flowing foam .",
    "we present a method developed to analyze precisely and completely this local response , quantified by various local fields .",
    "we extract velocity and velocity gradients , bubble deformations , and pressure , which describe the elastic and viscous parts of the foam response .",
    "we also define a new tensorial descriptor of the bubble rearrangements , and present the corresponding field , which quantifies accurately foam plastic response .",
    "the results highlight the differences of the foam local response with respect to simple viscoplastic and viscoelastic responses , namely a marked up / downstream asymmetry , signature of a delayed , elastic response of the foam , and a strong plastic response wherever the bubble deformation becomes close to a critical , yield strain .",
    "our results thus call for a modelisation coupling elastic , plastic and fluid behavior , and they also constitute an extensive database to test and constrain such models .",
    "we perform a stokes experiment ( @xcite ) , i.e. we study the flow of foam around obstacles ( fig . [ image ] ) , using a foam channel fully described in @xcite . briefly",
    ", a tank is filled with a bulk solution obtained by adding 1% of commercial dish - washing liquid ( taci , henkel ) to desionised water .",
    "its surface tension , measured with the oscillating bubble method , is @xmath0 mn m@xmath1 , and its kinematic viscosity , measured with a capillary viscosimeter , is @xmath2 mm s@xmath3 unless explicitly stated .",
    "nitrogen is blown in the solution through a nozzle or a tube at a computer controlled flow rate .",
    "this generates a `` liquid pool foam '' foam @xcite , constituted by a horizontal monolayer of monodisperse bubbles ( dispersity @xmath4 ) of average thickness @xmath5 , confined between the bulk solution and a glass top plate .",
    "this is a quasi-2d foam ( @xcite ) : despite the 3d geometry of the bubbles ( fig .",
    "[ image]b ) , it experiences 2d horizontal flows , which minimizes the effect of drainage .",
    "two others quasi-2d foams exist : the bubble raft ( no confinement ) , and the hele - shaw cell ( confinement between two horizontal plates ) . contrary to these two systems , the liquid pool foam has an effective in - plane compressibility ( @xcite ) , which enables to measure pressure easily , as recalled in section [ sectionpressure ] .",
    "the fluid fraction is adjusted by the foam thickness @xcite ; its value is 7% .",
    "the foam flows around an obstacle placed at the middle of the channel ; in the present study , we choose the flow rate between 24 and 515 ml min@xmath1 ( corresponding velocities : 0.11 to 2.5 cm s@xmath1 ) . in this paper",

    "we will then study the influence of each control parameter separately .",
    "this setup has allowed us to measure forces on obstacles ( @xcite ) and pressure drops associated to the flow of foam ( @xcite ) . for the purpose of the present paper , we record for every experiment a stack of 750 images , representing a movie of 30 seconds . from these movies",

    "we have defined several zones on the image each with different thresholds , to compensate from slight remaining spatial variations of light intensity .",
    "we finally extract the network of the bubble edges from the experimental images by a classical skeletonisation procedure , which reduces the foam to a network of one - pixel thick edges ( fig .",
    "[ skeletons]a ) .",
    "this procedure conserves the topology between the real and the skeletonized bubbles ( figs .",
    "[ image]a and [ skeletons]a ) , which enables a proper evaluation of the bubble deformation , as explained in section [ tensorialfields ] .",
    "it has two limitations : first , it distorts the geometry and curvature of the bubbles edges and vertices , which prevents us from evaluating precisely the elastic stress , since this requires integration along all edges ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , it is not adapted to the boundaries ; we therefore systematically eliminate the data near the obstacle and the channel walls .      for a 2d skeletonized foam ,",
    "the bubbles are bounded by thin edges , which merge in threefold vertices .",
    "bubbles are thus easily labelized , and a vertex can be unambiguously defined as a black pixel for which , among its eight neighboring pixels , one can find three pixels belonging to three different bubbles .",
    "boundaries vertices are defined as pixels on boundaries , with two neighboring pixels belonging to two different bubbles .",
    "we scan an image in two steps . in a first step , each individual bubble",
    "is labelized with a different number .",
    "the program records a list of bubbles , each bubble being represented by its number @xmath9 , its number of pixels @xmath10 , and the position @xmath11 of its barycenter . in a second step , vertices are identified and labelized , and the program records them in a second list , each vertex being represented by its number , its coordinates and the label of its neighboring bubbles .",
    "the subsequent analysis does not require the image .",

    "left : the edge to disappear is dotted ; middle : definition of the vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; right : the new edge is dashed.,width=453 ]    to compute the fields , we mesh the image by a rectangular grid .",
    "we have checked that there exists a mesh size for which the results do not change ( fig .",
    "[ boxsize ] ) : this validates our choice , and is a first indication of the continuous character of the foam ( see section [ averagesfluctuations ] ) .",
    "we have chosen to mesh the image with a rectangular grid of @xmath14 ( nearly ) square boxes of side 6 mm : such a choice enables us to capture well the variations at the macroscopic scale , and the statistics is sufficient for these variations to be smooth ( during the whole movie , about @xmath15 bubbles are computed per box ) . for simplicity ,",
    "each bubble is attributed to the box where its center lies even if part of it belongs to other boxes .",
    "plot of the velocity @xmath16 along the axis of symmetry of the flow , as a function of the streamwise coordinate @xmath17 , for a flow rate of 24 ml min@xmath1 and for two mesh sizes ( @xmath18 : boxes of area @xmath19 mm@xmath6 , @xmath20 : boxes of area @xmath21 mm@xmath6).,width=453 ]      from the list of bubbles , we compute the network of the vectors @xmath22 linking two centers of bubbles in contact , which we call the center network ( fig .",
    "[ skeletons]b ) . to be precise , each vector @xmath22",
    "is attributed to the two boxes ( with a coefficient @xmath23 each ) of the two bubble centers it binds .",
    "we then compute the texture tensor ( @xcite ) : @xmath24 which is the second - order tensor of components : @xmath25 .",
    "the average is performed over 750 images and all vectors in the box .",
    "this tensorial quantity has proven to be a good descriptor of bubble deformation : it reproduces the size , direction and amplitude of deformation of bubbles , in studies where it has been computed over the bubble edges network @xmath26 ( @xcite ) .",
    "here , we calculate it over the center network .",
    "with such a choice , the texture tensor definition ( [ definitionm ] ) is much more general than with the bubble edges network : it applies to 3d foams , and to wet foams such as the ones considered hereby .",
    "it is also more robust , because the center of masses , hence the vectors @xmath22 , is much less biased by skeletonisation than the bubble edges .",
    "anyway , the two possible network choices are equivalent at low bubble deformation .    in order to compute the velocity field ,",
    "we compare successive frames . in the studied range of flow rates ,",
    "the displacement of a bubble between two successive frames is small compared to its size ; the displacement of the bubble centers is thus easy to calculate , and we average all displacements on each box to get the velocity field ( eulerian rather than lagrangian point of view ) .    the calculation of the t1s is also based on the correlation of two successive images ; a t1 is a topological neighbor - swapping event , during which a bubble edge disappears and a new one is created ( fig .",
    "[ skeletons]c ) .",
    "the program tracks independently the disappearing and appearing edges , by comparing the list of edges of two successive frames .",
    "this decoupling of the disappearing and appearing edges is necessary for two reasons : first , the duration of a t1 event may be longer than the time interval between two successive frames ( 0.04 s ) ; second , the transient fourfold vertex ( middle of fig . [ skeletons]c ) contains a certain amount of liquid .",
    "after skeletonisation , this is often erroneously recognized as an artificial little four - sided bubble between the four bubbles experiencing the t1 , which we have to remove by imposing a lower threshold on the bubble area . actually , a t1 covers two distinct instantaneous events : one disappearance and one apparition of a link between two bubbles . to a disappearing ( appearing ) edge",
    "is associated the vector of the center network @xmath13 ( @xmath12 ) which links the centers of the two separating ( attaching ) bubbles .",
    "a complete quantification of t1s , including not only their frequency but also their direction , must rely on these vectors , whose direction is irrelevant by definition .",
    "we thus define the tensors @xmath27 , where @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is the frequency of separation ( attachment ) events per link @xmath22 of the center network ( @xcite ) .",
    "preliminary studies show that these tensors are closely related to the mechanical properties of the foam ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , in this paper , we use a more intuitive definition , based on unit vectors : @xmath30 , because it has the advantage to be directly proportional to the frequency of t1s .",
    "we present here the relevant fields describing the flow of foams , and the way they are computed from the image analysis detailed in the previous section .      as already mentioned in a previous study ( @xcite ) , in a quasi-2d setup with foam confined between a top plate and a liquid pool ,",
    "the depth of bubbles adjust to pressure variations .",
    "the 3d compressibility of the bubbles is negligible here : for an ideal , isothermal gas , the compression modulus is of order @xmath31 pa , which is 4 orders of magnitude higher to the measured local variations of pressure , as shown later ( fig .",
    "[ pressure ] ) .",
    "hence , the volume of a given bubble is constant ; but if its pressure increases , its depth increases to maintain equilibrium with the hydrostatic pressure of the bulk solution , hence its visible area decreases : the foam has an effective 2d compressibility in the plane of the top plate . the precise relationship between bubble area and pressure",
    "is established in another paper ( @xcite ) , in which we show that the relative uncertainty in pressure equals 2% .",
    "it writes : @xmath32 with @xmath33 kg m@xmath34 the volumetric mass of the solution , @xmath35 m s@xmath3 the gravity acceleration , and @xmath36 the constant bubble volume . here , @xmath37 is the local reference pressure , which embodies the constant pressure gradient along the channel ( @xcite ) :",
    "hence , @xmath38 is the local variation of pressure due to the presence of the obstacle .",
    "the average bubble area is easily computed in each box with the image analysis program .",
    "since the pressure field is scalar , it is convenient to represent it in gray levels .",
    "the image analysis program provides directly the velocity field , which we represent as usual with arrows .",
    "the velocity gradient is computed by finite differences ; we evaluate this gradient in the middle of the four boxes @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we rather use the symmetric velocity gradient , the deformation rate : @xmath43 , and the antisymmetric velocity gradient , the vorticity , which is a scalar for 2d flows : @xmath44 .",
    "we will precise the graphical representation of the deformation rate , and of the others tensorial quantities , in the following sections .",
    "we will also use the scalar dissipation function ( @xcite ) , defined as : @xmath45 .      as stated in section [ treatment ]",
    ", we use the texture tensor as a descriptor of bubble deformations . to be more quantitative",
    ", we will use the statistical elastic strain tensor , defined as ( @xcite):@xmath46 where @xmath47 is a reference value , that we choose isotropic : @xmath48 .",
    "here , @xmath49 is the average of the eigenvalues of the texture tensors evaluated at the upstream and downstream extremities of the observation field ( left and right on fig .",
    "[ image ] ) , where the bubbles are less perturbed by the presence of the obstacle , and @xmath50 is the 2d identity tensor .",
    "we use the statistical elastic strain tensor because it quantifies the elastic strain in foams , extending the classical elastic strain ( @xcite ) to plastic flows .",
    "the trace of this tensor quantifies the relative variation of area of the bubbles , which remains lower than 10% ( @xcite ) ; hence , in general , this tensor will have a positive eigenvalue and a negative one .",
    "we choose to represent such a tensor by two orthogonal lines , as explained in fig .",
    "[ reprtensors]a .",
    "the positive ( negative ) eigenvector represent the direction and amplitude of traction ( compression ) of deformed bubbles compared to the reference state .",
    "we also use this representation for the deformation rate which , like the statistical elastic strain , is an almost traceless tensor , since the flow remains weakly compressible . here , the positive ( negative ) eigenvector represent the direction and amplitude of maximal elongation ( compression ) rate .",
    "representation of symmetric tensors ( i.e. with orthogonal eigenvectors ) : ( a ) representation of a tensor with two eigenvalues of different sign ( @xmath51 ) . the thick ( thin ) line represents the direction and magnitude of the positive ( negative ) eigenvalue ; ( b ) elliptic representation of a tensor with strictly positive eigenvalues ( @xmath52).,width=453 ]",
    "finally , we represent the t1s by the two tensors @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( section [ treatment ] ) ; these two tensors are symmetric with strictly positive eigenvalues ; there is therefore suitably represented by ellipses ( fig .",
    "[ reprtensors]b ) of parameterized equations : @xmath55 in this case , the major axis is the preferred direction for t1s to occur .",
    "we justify this ( new ) way to quantify t1s in section [ sectiont1 ] .",
    "in this section , we present the local measurements for a foam flowing around an obstacle .",
    "we first focus on a reference case : the flow of a monodisperse foam ( bubble area : 16.0 mm@xmath6 , foam thickness : 3.5 mm , bulk viscosity : 1.06 mm@xmath6 s@xmath1 , flow rate : 176 ml min@xmath1 ) around a circular obstacle of diameter 30 mm . we compare averages and fluctuations of a local field to show that the foam behaves like a continuous medium ( section [ averagesfluctuations ] ) .",
    "we then present a full study of the reference case ( section [ reference ] ) , and separate the influence of each control parameter ( section [ controlparameters ] ) .",
    "can we consider the foam as a continuous medium in our case ?",
    "this is not obvious _ a priori _ , since the steady flow arises from a balance between the load experienced by the bubbles passing around the obstacle , and the discrete relaxations occurring during t1 events ( @xcite ) : locally - defined quantities like elastic stress or statistical elastic strain fluctuate around an average value .",
    "we consider here the influence of such fluctuations and their correlations , since various studies have shown their great importance , especially when t1 avalanches occur ( @xcite ) , leading to strong stress drops ( @xcite ) .    to address this question ,",
    "we analyse the temporal fluctuations of a local quantity for our reference case , in the same spirit as ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have chosen the statistical elastic strain tensor @xmath56 , but the analysis would be similar on other local quantities such as velocity or pressure .",
    "more precisely , we have chosen to analyse one scalar quantity extracted from @xmath56 : the square of the difference between the two eigenvalues @xmath57 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "this quantity scales as the elastic energy associated to shear strain ; hence , it is expected to exhibit some huge drops if t1 avalanches occur , since they release a lot of elastic energy .",
    "we have analysed the fluctuations in a box close to the trailing side of the obstacle ( fig .",
    "[ fluctpetitgrand]a , right ) , where fluctuations are expected to be strong ; we will see later that this is also a region where t1s are frequent .",
    "the temporal variations of the bubble deformation is reported in fig .",
    "[ fluctpetitgrand]a .",
    "qualitatively , we do not observe a behavior dominated by t1 avalanches : such a behavior would correspond to a succession of low increases ( load ) and quick drops ( relaxation ) of the elastic energy .",
    "quantitatively , we analyse the increments of the bubble deformation between two successive images , and report the histogram of the distribution of these increments in fig .",
    "[ histopetitgrand]a .",
    "this histogram is well fitted by a gaussian curve , characteristic of a white noise , and we do not observe an asymmetric distribution with a lot of small increases and a number of large decreases , which would correspond to t1 avalanches .",

    "( b ) results on a box of size @xmath59 cm@xmath6 ( average : @xmath62 , standard deviation : @xmath63 ) .",
    "the curves superimposed are gaussian curves with the same mean and standard deviation as the increments.,width=453 ]    however , the considered box is a small box , where only seven bubbles in average are present at a given instant .",
    "one could thus argue that fluctuations are dominated by advection , not by possible t1 avalanches occurring at larger scale .",
    "we thus analyse the fluctuations at a larger scale , choosing a box 18 times bigger , in the wake of the obstacle ( fig .",
    "[ fluctpetitgrand]b , right ) .",
    "the relative fluctuations are much smaller ( fig .",
    "[ fluctpetitgrand]b ) , and the increments are here again well fitted by a gaussian curve ( fig .",
    "[ histopetitgrand]b ) .",
    "we have performed this quantitative analysis of the fluctuations only in our reference experiment , but we observed in the other experiments analysed here that the fluctuations do not present large - scale correlations ; they are similar to a random , white noise and play a negligible role at large scales .",
    "we will thus only focus on coarse - grained average quantities , and treat the foam as a continuous medium .",
    "the generality of such an approach is discussed in section [ discaveragesfluctuations ] .      for each studied field",
    ", we proceed as follows : we first present a map of the whole field , and we then study the variation of the field components along various lines : two directed streamwise , one on the axis of the obstacle and another aside , at 2.5 cm from the axis of symmetry of the flow ; and three directed spanwise : one passing through the center of the obstacle , one upstream and the symmetric downstream one , both lines being at 2.4 cm from the middle axis ( fig .

    ", width=453 ]    the data for the big circle and the cogwheel are very similar , showing that the boundary conditions have little influence on the behavior of the foam .",
    "the comparison between the two circles show that whereas the radial component of the velocity is almost equal , the amplitude of the orthoradial component is bigger for the bigger circle .",
    "this is actually a consequence of the constriction between the obstacles and the channel walls : more precisely , at the angle @xmath117 , we have @xmath118 for the circle of diameter 48 mm , and @xmath119 for the circle of diameter 30 mm , which is comparable to the aspect ratio @xmath120 , with @xmath121 cm the channel width and @xmath122 the obstacle diameter : this ratio equals 1.92 and 1.43 for these two circles . moreover , whereas the amplitude of variation of the pressure is weaker for the small circle , the statistical elastic strain component @xmath113 does not change much between the three obstacles .",
    "it is negative and almost constant for angles between 100 and 180@xmath104 ( fig .",
    "[ obstacles ] ) , which corresponds actually to an extended region where the yield strain is reached ; the component @xmath123 has a markedly different behavior for angles between 0 and 100@xmath104 , where it follows a monotonic , almost linear evolution , which is the signature of an elastic - like transition to another yielded region , situated in the wake of the obstacle .",
    "this is confirmed by the polar dependence of the frequency of t1s ( fig .",
    "[ t1polaire ] ) , which shows a high frequency in the yielded regions for angles close to 0@xmath104 and comprised between 100 and 180@xmath104 , whereas the frequency of t1s is lower in between .",
    "a simple sketch of this behavior , with a yielded region on the whole leading side of the obstacle and an elastic transition at the trailing side to another yielded region in the wake , helps to understand the fluid fraction dependence of the drag on circles ( @xcite ) as well as the angular dependence of the drag , lift and torque experienced by an ellipse ( @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis of section [ averagesfluctuations ] , showing that the fluctuations are like a white noise , suggests that the foam behaves as a continuous medium . we do not measure large - scale correlations of plastic rearrangements",
    "this is to compare to flows involving pure shear , like experiments in couette geometry ( @xcite ) . in this case , a disordered and wet foam in a hele - shaw cell exhibits a strong discontinuity in the form of a localised shear band ( @xcite ) , resulting from large - scale avalanches of t1 ( @xcite ) , but a disordered and wet bubble raft shows no such bands ( @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the friction between the foam and the boundaries alters the continuity of any quasi-2d foam .",
    "indeed , a recent study has shown that at given flow rate in the same couette geometry , liquid pool foams exhibit localization contrary to bubble rafts ( @xcite ) .    however , our liquid pool foam does not exhibit localisation .",
    "actually , the flow around an obstacle is more complex than a pure shear and screens the correlations of t1s , even though we have very ordered foams . qualitatively , we only saw large - scale correlations with very wet and ordered foams , where dislocations between rows of bubbles can occur on distances of several centimeters . in the experiments presented here , it only occurs for the smallest foam thickness .",
    "a salient feature of the flow of foam around an obstacle is the asymmetry up / downstream of the velocity field .",
    "such an asymmetry is not captured by the models of bingham plastics ( @xcite ) or herschel - bulkley fluids ( @xcite ) usually invoked to simply model liquid foams .",
    "it is an elastic effect , and the velocity overshoot in the wake of the obstacle ( fig .",
    "[ velocity ] ) has already been reported ( and termed negative wake ) for a number of other elastic fluids ( see e.g. @xcite ) . however , a more quantitative comparison to other viscoelastic fluids is difficult , because of the boundary conditions : for a viscoelastic fluid , there is no slip against a solid boundary , whereas at the macroscopic scale , the foam slips against the walls and the obstacle ( fig .",
    "[ velocityfield ] ) .",
    "more precisely , a high velocity gradient is concentrated in the thin liquid film between the solid boundaries and the neighboring bubbles .",
    "we showed that the pressure in maximal at the upstream side of the obstacle , and minimal at the downstream side ( section [ refpressure ] ) , and that it does not depend significantly on the flow rate ( section [ influenceq ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the pressure is mainly of elastic origin , which is also corroborated by the anti - inertial lift observed for an airfoil ( @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , fitting the data for the pressure along the axis @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ comparisonq ] ) by a power - law yields the following dependence : @xmath124 ( expressed in pa ) .",
    "the exponent is close to @xmath125 , which is coherent with the stress distribution is an elastic medium under a point - like force ( @xcite ) .",
    "the asymmetric repartition of the t1s ( fig .",
    "[ t1norme2 ] ) is a major result of this study , since the plastic flow of the foam results from the superposition of many t1s .",
    "since t1s more likely occur for deformed bubbles , it is interesting to compare their repartition with the map of statistical elastic strain ( fig .",
    "[ ufield ] ) .",
    "such a comparison reveals that the regions of frequent t1s indeed correspond to high deformation , but the correlation is not so simple : for instance , upstream from the obstacle , the deformation is maximal at @xmath74 ( fig .",
    "[ deformation ] ) , whereas the t1s occur more likely on the sides of the obstacle , not at @xmath74 ( fig .",
    "[ t1polaire ] ) .",
    "this occurs because in this region , the velocity gradients acts to increase the preexistent deformation ( fig .",
    "[ deformationrate ] ) .",
    "there is thus a strong coupling between the statistical elastic strain , the velocity gradients and the t1 repartition , which is analysed in more detail elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "we now compare qualitatively our results to the force measurements realized in the same conditions in @xcite .",
    "to summarize , this study showed that the drag exerted by a flowing foam on a circular obstacle scales as : @xmath126 with @xmath127 the bulk viscosity , and @xmath128 a decreasing function of the bubble area .",
    "the independence of the pressure and the bubble deformation on the flow rate is in qualitative agreement with the linear increase of the force exerted by the flowing foam on the obstacle ( @xcite ) , if we assume that the velocity - dependent contribution to the force is mainly due to the viscous friction in the liquid films between the obstacle and the surrounding bubbles .",
    "moreover , the exponent for the bulk viscosity in ( [ scalingforce ] ) is close to 1 , which is compatible with the weak influence of this parameter ( fig .",
    "[ comparisonv ] ) . concerning the foam thickness , fig .",
    "[ comparisone ] shows that the up / downstream differences increases with the foam thickness , hence decreases with the fluid fraction .",
    "this is compatible with the decrease of the drag with the fluid fraction reported in @xcite .",
    "the role of the bubble area is more complex : we showed in section [ influencea ] that this parameter does not influence much the bubble deformation , but that the up / downstream difference in pressure decreases with increasing bubble area .",
    "the bubble deformation and pressure being the two contributions to the yield drag @xmath128 in ( [ scalingforce ] ) , this qualitatively agrees with the fact that @xmath128 decreases with the bubble area .",
    "however , we do not understand yet why the behavior of the pressure and deformation differs so markedly .",
    "the last studied control parameter , the obstacle itself , shows that the boundary conditions at the obstacle plays no significant role .",
    "the size of the obstacle has two influences : the bigger the circle , the higher the velocity at its sides , due to the imposed constriction , and the higher the amplitude of variation of the pressure .",
    "this is compatible with the measured values of the drag coefficient ( ratio of drag and obstacle radius ) reported in @xcite for these three obstacles , equal for the cogwheel and the big circle , and slightly lower for the small circle .",
    "we performed a systematic local description of the flow of foam around a circular obstacles , quantifying the elasticity by the statistical elastic strain tensor and the pressure field , the plasticity by a tensorial descriptor of bubble rearrangements , and the flow by the velocity field and its gradients .",
    "we demonstrate in section [ averagesfluctuations ] that such a continuous approach is justified and suitable in this case .",
    "the study of a reference experiment ( section [ reference ] ) shows a marked asymmetry up / downstream : the velocity exhibits an overshoot in the wake , and the bubble rearrangements spread more at the leading side than in the wake of the obstacle .",
    "this reveals the complex behavior of the foam , dictated by the coupling between elasticity ( bubble deformations ) , plasticity ( bubble rearrangements ) and flow ( velocity gradients ) .",
    "we showed in section [ influenceq ] that the rescaled velocity @xmath129 , the pressure and the bubble deformation do not depend significantly on the flow rate , in the studied range .",
    "hence , the yield and the dynamic contributions in foam rheology seem to be decoupled , which justifies recent approaches to model foam flows ( and more generally , complex fluid flows ) as bingham plastics with an added elastic term independent of the shear rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , such scalar approaches are not sufficient in our context , where the complex flow around an obstacle appeals for a tensorial description .",
    "it would be interesting to perform the same experiments at higher flow rate , to determine when this decoupling between elastic and dynamic contribution breaks down , and to investigate whether phenomena such as elastic turbulence ( @xcite ) could then occur in the wake of the obstacle .",
    "the detailed results shown in section [ results ] , combined with the associated force measurements reported in @xcite , severely constrain the rheological models adapted to describe liquid foams . the foam flowing around an obstacle",
    "intrinsically exhibits yield stress and dissipation ( yield drag on the obstacle ( @xcite ) ) , and elastic stress ( up / downstream asymmetry ) ; all these effects can only be captured by a whole elastoviscoplatic model .",
