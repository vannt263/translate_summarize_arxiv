    "the orion nebula is one of the best studied star formation regions in the galaxy . the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) designates the inner 3 pc ( @xmath0 20 arcmin ) from @xmath1c orionis , and contains more than three thousand stars .",
    "the core of the onc , also known as the trapezium cluster @xcite , comprises the stars located within 0.3 pc ( @xmath0 2 arcmin ) of @xmath1c orionis , it has an inferred stellar density of about 8000 stars pc@xmath2 and it is one of the densest known region of star formation @xcite .",
    "most of the onc members are visible , primarily because the massive stars in the trapezium cluster have swept the gas from the molecular cloud creating a cavity facing towards us .",
    "the structure , dynamics and stellar content of the onc have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the stars in the onc are less than 1 myr old and their masses range from @xmath30.05 m   to @xmath050 m  @xcite .",
    "studies of the outer regions of the orion nebula ( flanking fields ) have revealed the presence of young stars of ages between 1 and 3 myrs old @xcite , with an accretion disk fraction of about 40% @xcite .",
    "the orion nebula provides an excellent laboratory for studying pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars , given its proximity ( 470 pc ) , its age and its stellar diversity .",
    "pms stars are strong x - ray emitters ; typical pms stars have x - ray luminosities @xmath4 to @xmath5 above those observed in older main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission in low mass stars comes from magnetic reconnection . in the dynamo model ,",
    "the strength of the magnetic field , and hence the x - ray activity , depends on the rate of differential rotation and on the depth of the outer convective envelope @xcite .",
    "there is a clear relationship between rotation rate ( period ) and x - ray luminosity ( @xmath6 ) found in late - type stars in clusters as old as ngc 2547 ( 15 - 40 myrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) through the hyades ( @xmath0500 myrs , * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio between the x - ray and bolometric luminosity , @xmath6/@xmath7 , increases with increasing rotation rate , until the most rapidly rotating stars reach a maximum x - ray luminosity ( or saturation level ) such that @xmath6/@xmath7@xmath8 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "it is much less clear that rotation and @xmath6/@xmath7   are related in younger clusters .",
    "@xcite studied a 4.5 square degree region centered in the orion nebula , using x - ray data from the einstein observatory .",
    "they found that at least 100 sources were associated with late - type pms stars , and their x - ray activity was not correlated with published rotational periods and spectroscopic rotational velocities .",
    "@xcite used rosat x - ray data in a similar study in the orion nebula , finding no dependence of x - ray activity on rotation .",
    "more recently , the chandra observatory has provided significantly improved spatial resolution and sensitivity for x - ray observations .",
    "@xcite reported x - ray observations of the onc using the chandra observatory acis - i detector .",
    "they found more than a thousand x - ray sources , 91% of them associated with known stellar members of the cluster .",
    "@xcite also see no obvious correlation between rotation and @xmath6/@xmath7   for their onc sample , and conclude that the x - ray generation mechanism for young pms stars must be different from that responsible in young main sequence stars . @xcite",
    "analyzed data for a number of young associations and clusters ( including orion ) , and agree that there is little correlation between @xmath6/@xmath7   and rotation at very young ages , but conclude that the data are consistent with a single physical mechanism , where the orion - age stars are simply all at or near the saturation level .",
    "we intend to use our orion flanking field data and other new chandra data for ngc 2264 @xcite to help determine at what age the relationship between rotation and @xmath6/@xmath7   emerges .    in the present paper",
    ", we present results of chandra observations of two of the flanking fields ( ff ) in the orion nebula ( fields # 2 & # 4 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , just outside the onc .",
    "we discuss source detection , variability and @xmath6   determination , providing a catalog of 417 x - ray sources .",
    "we present evidence that the x - ray selected sample of pms stars in the flanking fields in orion are older than a similarly selected sample in the onc . in paper iii @xcite",
    ", we will discuss in more detail the relationships found here between rotation rate , mass accretion rate , disk indicators , and x - ray luminosity , in our field of ngc 2264 and the two orion flanking fields .",
    "two flanking fields in orion were observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) detector on board the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite . the imaging array ( acis - i ) consists of four 1024@xmath91024 front - side illuminated ccds and covers an area on the sky of about 17@xmath917. the north orion flanking field ( noff ) is centered at @xmath10 , about 36 @xmath11 ( @xmath0 5 pc , at a distance of 470 pc ) north of the trapezium cluster , and it was observed on 2002 august 26 with a total exposure time of 48.8 ks . the south orion flanking field ( soff ) , centered at @xmath12 , about 17 @xmath11 ( @xmath0 2.5 pc , at a distance of 470 pc ) south of the trapezium cluster , was observed on 2002 september 6 with a total exposure time of 47.9 ks .",
    "figure  [ dss ] shows a 1@xmath13 image of orion from the palomar digital sky survey @xcite , with both chandra acis - i fields of view marked as boxes .",
    "the fields were selected to maximize the number of stars in the field of view with known periods from @xcite and with minimal overlap with other contemporaneous chandra orion observation @xcite .",
    "data analysis was performed in the same manner as described in @xcite , where we discussed similar observations of a field in ngc2264 . in summary , we started with the level 1 processed event list , applied charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) correction as described in @xcite , then filtered by asca grades ; by time intervals ; and by background flaring due to solar activity .",
    "removal of the background flares identified by the latter step reduced the exposure time to 46.9 ks for the noff and to 46.3 ks for the soff .",
    "finally , the energy range was restricted to 0.3  10 kev .",
    "the filtering process was done using the chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) package .",
    "figures  [ orion_n ] and  [ orion_s ] show the acis - i image of the filtered observations for the noff and the soff , respectively .",
    "x - ray sources were identified using the _ wavdetect _ tool within the ciao package .",
    "the _ wavdetect _ tool works well in detecting x - ray sources in crowded fields .",
    "this tool performs a mexican hat wavelet decomposition and reconstruction of the image as described in @xcite .",
    "we used wavelet scales ranging from 1 to 16 pixels in steps of @xmath14 , and the default source significance threshold of @xmath15 .",
    "the _ wavdetect _ tool was run separately in the four acis - i ccds images for both fields and it produced an original list of 256 sources for the noff and 280 sources for the soff ( see sec  [ xray_phot ] ) .      the positions of the sources obtained by _",
    "wavdetect _ were correlated with 2mass positions .",
    "each x - ray source was manually checked to confirm that the 2mass counterpart lay within the radius for count extraction ( as defined in @xcite ) .",
    "we checked the astrometry of the chandra observations using all x - ray sources located within an off - axis angle ( @xmath16 ) less than 5 arcmin that have 2mass counterparts .",
    "a total of 85 noff sources and 70 soff sources meet this criteria .",
    "we determined a mean offset in r.a . of @xmath17 0.02 and a mean offset in dec of @xmath18 0.03 between the noff chandra and 2mass coordinates and a mean offset in r.a .",
    "of @xmath19 0.03 and a mean offset in dec of @xmath20 0.03 between the soff chandra and 2mass coordinates .",
    "the chandra positions were corrected by these mean offsets to put the x - ray sources in the same reference frame as their 2mass counterparts .",
    "x - ray aperture photometry was initially performed on the 536 sources detected by the ciao tool _",
    "wavdetect_. the radius for count extraction , @xmath21 , and the annulus for background determination were defined in the same manner as in @xcite .",
    "the x - ray counts ( @xmath22 ) and background counts were extracted using the ciao tool _ dmextract_. we computed the background in counts@xmath9arcsec@xmath23 as a function of off - axis angle ( @xmath16 ) , performing a 3@xmath24 rejection fit to avoid background counts from annuli that have other sources within .",
    "the computed background was constant as a function of @xmath16 , and it had a value of @xmath25=(0.072@xmath260.024)counts@xmath9arcsec@xmath23 for the noff and a value of @xmath25=(0.059@xmath260.021)counts@xmath9arcsec@xmath23 for the soff .",
    "the net count , _ n.  c. _ and the count rate , _ c.  r. _ were computed for each source as in @xcite .",
    "we carefully inspected the light curves of all the sources ( see sec .",
    "[ variability ] ) and their appearance in the image of the chandra field of view .",
    "a total of 119 ( 22% ) sources were rejected from the original list : 107 sources had light curves consistent with cosmic ray afterglows , 5 sources were detected twice , since _",
    "wavdetect _ was run separately in each ccd , and 7 sources were located at the edge of the field of view . of the 107 light curves having a cosmic ray shape , 106 ( 99% ) contain cosmic ray afterglows flagged by the pipeline .",
    "our final list of 417 x - ray sources ( 203 from the noff , 214 from the soff ) is provided in table  [ tab_xray ] .",
    "we selected all sources with more than 500 net counts , extracted their spectra and fit them to measure their x - ray fluxes .",
    "a total of 24 sources from the noff and 20 sources from the soff meet this criteria and they are listed in table  [ tab_spectra ] . the spectra were extracted within @xmath21 using the ciao tool _ dmextract_. the spectra of the noff and the soff sources are shown in figures  [ spectra_n ] and  [ spectra_s ] , respectively .",
    "we used the same spectral fitting process , as described by @xcite , with the redistribution matrix files ( rmf ) provided by the cti corrector @xcite , auxiliary response files ( arf ) created by the ciao tool _",
    "mkarf _ and later corrected for the acis low energy quantum efficiency degradation .",
    "we adopted a photoelectric absorption model ( @xmath27 ) , which uses wisconsin cross sections from @xcite .",
    "this model has one parameter that is the equivalent hydrogen column density ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the hydrogen column density was fixed to a value of 0.08@xmath29 to match an extinction value of @xmath30 = 0.41 , which is the most likely value of the observed extinction towards both orion flanking fields ( see * ? ? ? * for more discussion ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the error in @xmath6   that comes from fixing @xmath28 is negligible .",
    "finally , we adopted a thermal emission model ( @xmath31 ) based on the model calculations of @xcite , and @xcite with fe l calculations by @xcite .",
    "this model includes line emissions from several elements .",
    "the remaining two parameters in the model are the plasma temperature ( kt ) and a normalization factor . as in the analysis of ngc 2264 chandra observations @xcite",

    "the spectral parameters obtained from the two plasma temperature models are listed in table  [ tab_spectra ] .",
    "the x - ray flux for the brightest sources is determined from the best spectral model derived from the mean model parameters .",
    "we computed mean plasma temperatures of ( 0.63@xmath260.05 ) kev and ( 2.6@xmath260.3 ) kev for the noff sources and mean plasma temperatures of ( 0.77@xmath260.05 ) kev and ( 2.9@xmath260.2 ) kev for the soff sources .",
    "the mean plasma temperatures are held constant and the integration of the best fit between 0.3 and 8.0 kev provides the x - ray flux .",

    "the values of these conversion factors are in reasonably good agreement with the derived conversion factor for our similar x - ray observation in ngc 2264 ( 6.16@xmath260.13@xmath32 ( erg/@xmath33/s)/(counts / ks ) * ? ? ?",

    "the @xmath38 values are listed in column 12 of table  [ tab_xray ] .",

    "the clustering of the x - ray sources above the 3 myr isochrone is additional confirmation that stars in the locus are more likely to be true members of the cluster than stars below this locus .",
    "there is one star ( s038 ) with @xmath57 brighter than 0 magnitude .",
    "its optical counterpart , par 1605 , has a spectral type of a0v .",
    "it has log(@xmath6)=30.1 and @xmath6/@xmath7=@xmath61 .",
    "x - ray emission from late b stars and early a stars is rare , since they are in the transition between wind driven x - ray emission from hot stars and magnetically driven coronae from late type stars . it is often speculated that the x - ray emission observed in late b and early a stars comes from unseen late type companions @xcite , that explanation could apply to par 1605 .",
    "there are 3 x - ray sources that appear to be much older than @xmath58 years .",
    "one of them ( 141s ) , has unreliable photometry because of background contamination from a nearby star .",
    "the other sources ( n068 and s115 ) lack both spectral type and membership information .",
    "if we deredden sources n068 and s115 ( see figure  [ color_color ] ) along reddening vector towards the locus of ctt stars , we derive a @xmath30 value of 5.9 magnitudes for source n068 and @xmath30 value of 2.1 magnitudes for source s115 . the locations of sources n068 and s115 are indicated along with their dereddened positions in figure  [ color_color ] . in figure",
    "[ cmd4 ] , we have plotted the @xmath62 color magnitude diagram of all the infrared sources with x - ray counterparts , with isochrones from @xcite . the locations of sources n068 and s115 are indicated along with their possible dereddened position .",
    "it is possible that these two objects are the youngest and most embedded of our x - ray sources , if they are indeed members of the orion complex .",
    "the unusual optical colors of these sources could be explained by scattered light from an edge on disk .",
    "figure  [ xcmd ] shows the dereddened color magnitude diagram for three x - ray selected samples . on the left panel ,",
    "we plot the ngc 2264 sample from @xcite , which includes 201 stars showing x - ray emission .",
    "the central panel shows orion ff data from the present work .",
    "finally , the right panel shows 584 x - ray onc sources @xcite that have optical counterparts from our database .",
    "the stars from the three samples have been dereddened using the following criteria .",
    "if the star has a known spectral type , we have used @xmath63 derived from the spectra . for the remaining stars ,",
    "we have derived @xmath63 from @xmath42 photometry , assuming that the stars are pms stars .",
    "we use @xmath63 from infrared colors if this is greater than one magnitude .",
    "if not , we use the median @xmath63 for each field ( @xmath63=0.25 for ngc 2264 , @xmath63=0.25 for orion ff , and @xmath63=1.31 for the onc , herbig & terndrup 1986 ) .",
    "this criterion is reasonable for fields with variable reddening , as the onc , where @xmath63 can be as high as 4 magnitudes .",
    "there are several notable differences among the shown cmds .",
    "ngc 2264 stars appear to be more compactly distributed than the onc stars .",
    "there are fewer high mass stars in the orion ff sample than in the onc sample .",
    "the ngc 2264 sample appears to be the oldest of the three samples .",
    "one way to quantify these differences is through the use of statistical boxes .",
    "we have divided each x - ray selected sample into smaller samples containing stars of a determined color range of 0.5 magnitudes of width . for each color range we have determined a box , as defined by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the central horizontal line in each box is the median @xmath64 for the range in @xmath65 color , while the bottom and the top of the box shows its inter  quartile range ( containing 50% of the sample ) , and the vertical lines coming out of the box mark the position of the adjacent points of the sample ( most extreme values in the sample that are not more than 1.5 times the inter ",
    "quartile range ) . in figure  [ xcmd_box ]",
    "we show the box plots for the three samples together with isochrones from @xcite . we have only plotted the boxes that overlap with all three samples , are within the range of isochrones ( @xmath66 ) , and are not subject to biases from the optical limit of the catalog or other intrinsic properties ( @xmath67 ;",
    "we have also plotted in the three panels horizontal dotted lines that correspond to the median value of the orion ff boxes . the median",
    ", upper and lower quartile @xmath64 values are listed in table  [ tab_boxes ] for each of the @xmath65 color ranges and for three the samples of x - ray sources .",
    "all the ngc 2264 medians are systematically lower than the orion ff medians , with a mean difference of 0.3 magnitudes ( @xmath24=0.1 ) .",
    "all the onc medians are systematically higher than the orion ff medians , with a mean difference of 0.3 magnitudes ( @xmath24=0.1 ) .",
    "the effect of reddening is very small , since the reddening vectors go almost parallel to the isochrones .",
    "if we used the median reddening for each field , we find the same mean differences in the median @xmath64 for each color range . if we used a @xmath30 one magnitude higher or one magnitude lower , we get again the same differences in the median @xmath64 .",
    "the observed differences can be explained by a difference in age among the three samples . using the @xcite isochrones",
    ", we derive an age of @xmath02 myrs , @xmath01 myrs , and @xmath00.5 myrs for the x - ray selected samples of ngc 2264 , orion ff , and onc , respectively . alternatively , assuming vertical hayashi tracks , stellar luminosities scale as @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "thus , differences in luminosity of 0.3 magnitudes corresponds to ratios in age of a factor of @xmath01.5 .",
    "searching for young stars in x - rays is known to be a efficient way of finding young stars ( for example , the rass , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "does the age difference for the * x - ray selected * stars in the three regions apply as well for all low mass members in the three regions ?",
    "our own belief is that x - ray selection does not bias yso population statistics in terms of age and mass ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and therefore our age estimates should be valid for the entire set of stars in the three regions .",
    "we caution however that x - ray selection may result in bias for other physical parameters , such as rotation or disk properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to provide some support to our assertion concerning x - ray selection bias and age , we have constructed plots like figure  [ xcmd_box ] for low mass members of the three clusters located within the chandra field of view but not restricted to x - ray detection .",
    "we derived box - plots for the optical sample of likely members in all three regions using two different reddening prescriptions - one with a mean reddening for each field , and one where we derived reddening exactly as for figure  [ xcmd_box ] . in both cases , we derived similar ages and age differences for the three fields .",
    "we note that this result differs from that reported in @xcite and @xcite , where no age difference was found between optical samples in the onc and the orion flanking fields .",
    "the earlier studies used larger fields and a different statistical method that may have smeared out any age differences that might be present .",
    "we note that none of the essential conclusions in earlier papers change in any way if the orion flanking fields are indeed older ( or contain a range of older ages ) than the onc .",
    "we present a catalog of orion x - ray sources from two flanking fields .",
    "the observations were taken with the acis - i on board the chandra x - ray observatory .",
    "the catalog , consisting of 417 sources , includes x - ray luminosity , optical and infrared photometry and x - ray variability information .",
    "we found 91 variable sources , 33 of which have a flare like light curve , and 11 of which have a pattern of a steady increase or decrease . from the optical and infrared counterparts of the x - ray sources",
    ", we have learned that most of the x - ray sources have colors consistent with ctts that are younger than @xmath58 years .",
    "we argue that the data are consistent with an age difference among the x - ray selected samples of ngc 2264 , orion ff , and onc , with ngc 2264 being the oldest , and onc being the youngest .",
    "this catalog of x - ray sources will be used to study the relationship between rotational properties and x - ray characteristics of orion and ngc 2264 stars in paper iii @xcite .",
    "we plan to discuss correlations of @xmath6/@xmath7   with rotation rate ( period and @xmath69sin@xmath70 ) , disk indicators ( @xmath71 , @xmath52 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 ) , and mass accretion rate as derived from @xmath72 excess .",
    "we will also compare the @xmath6/@xmath7   values found here with those from other young clusters .",
