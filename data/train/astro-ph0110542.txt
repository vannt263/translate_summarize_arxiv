    "this position changes with observing frequency as @xmath3 @xcite . the power index @xmath4 depends on the shape of the electron energy spectrum and on the magnetic field and particle density distributions in the ultra - compact jet .",
    "hence , by studying variations at @xmath4 as a function of frequency , we may study the detailed physical conditions of the radio emitting region and the ambient environment of the source very near the central engine .",
    "following @xcite we can estimate basic physical parameters of the jet including luminosity , maximum brightness temperature , magnetic field in the jet , particle density , and the geometrical properties of the jet ( i.e. , the core location respect to the jet origin ) .    to measure @xmath4 a knowledge of the absolute position of the core ( or at least the core offset between different frequencies )",
    "is needed .",
    "hybrid maps in vlbi lack this positional information due to the use of closure - phase in the imaging process . the rigorous alignment of hybrid maps can be made by astrometric phase - referencing ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in sources with extended structure , an optically thin component can be used to align maps at different frequencies and then estimate the position of the core .",

    "many of the css sources display polarized emission at cm - wavelengths .",
    "the ionized gas surrounding the jet disrupts its flow and is responsible of the complexity of the radio structures seen .",
    "there is evidence suggesting that 3c309.1 is located at the center of a very massive cooling flow with @xmath11 within a radius of 11.5h@xmath7kpc @xcite .",
    "vlba observations of 3c309.1 at 6 frequencies were used for determining the behavior of @xmath4 between 1.6 and 22ghz @xcite . to improve and extend this determination to higher frequencies ,",
    "we observed 3c309.1 using the vlba at eight frequencies with dual polarization . in this contribution , we present a preliminary analysis of the new observations .",

    "these values are also presented in table  [ table : coreoffset ] , and in the right panel of fig .",

    "the trend in the dependence of the core position with the frequency is different in both methods .",
    "b separation measurements is apparently frequency - independent : the difference at the beams at different frequencies may bias this result , since the structure of the b component is l - shaped and in the declination coordinate it is more extended to the south .",
    "our preliminary positional results from the aips astrometry at 8.4 , 15 and 22ghz ( but not at 5ghz ) suggest that the peak - of - brigthness of the maps shifts closer to the jet basis ( core at infinite frequency ) at higher frequencies , being this jet basis to the north of the a feature . this would be the expected opacity shift produced by the synchrotron self - absorption in the jet . assuming that @xmath4=1 ( self - absorbed core , @xcite ) at 8.4ghz and that @xmath12 , the astrometric results provide values of @xmath4=1.1@xmath130.5 at 15ghz and @xmath4=0.9@xmath130.6 at 22ghz .",

    "we have presented preliminary results from a detailed multi - frequency study of the qso 3c309.1 based on the vlba observations made in mid 1998 .",
    "we find a curved jet extending up to 100mas to the east at low frequencies with two main components , a and b. the a component has a turnover frequency around 8.4ghz and the b component is optically thin .",
    "the polarized intensity map at 1.5ghz shows that the core is un polarized . in the region southern to b the electric field has a radial structure .",
    "the external parts of the jet have a high degree of polarization .",
    "a preliminary astrometric analysis provides a determination of the core position at different frequencies by phase - referencing to a nearby radio source qso s51448 + 76 .",
    "the changes at the core position with frequency suggest high opacity close to the core caused by synchrotron self - absorption . due to the big uncertainties we can not make any assert about the value of @xmath4 at high frequencies . an exhaustive analysis including ionospheric and tropospheric bias removal and physical modeling of the source will be presented in a forthcoming paper",
