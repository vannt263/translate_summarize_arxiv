    "the behavior of polymer chains in random media is a well studied problem [ 1 - 8 ] that has applications in diverse fields . besides the polymers themselves this problem",
    "is directly related to the statistical mechanics of a quantum particle in a random potential @xcite , the behavior of flux lines in superconductors in the presence of columnar defects @xcite , and the problem of diffusion in a random catalytic environment @xcite . it was found in ref",
    ".  @xcite that a very long gaussian chain , immersed in a random medium with very short range correlations of the disorder , will typically curl up in some small region of low potential energy .",
    "the polymer chain is said to be localized and for long chains the end - to - end distance becomes independent of chain length ( @xmath0 ) . for short chains the end - to - end distance scales diffusively ( @xmath1 ) . in a related paper @xcite",
    ", it was found , using the replica approach , that a quantum particle exhibits glassy behavior at low temperatures .",
    "the low temperature limit for a quantum particle translates into the long chain limit for polymers .",
    "it implies that the free energy landscape of a long chain is typically very complicated and possesses many metastable states .",
    "recently a new variational solution has been found for gaussian chain embedded in a random @xmath2-correlated potential @xcite .",
    "this solution , which involve replica - symmetry - breaking ( rsb ) at the 1-step level , gives rise to the correct behavior of the end - to - end distance of the chain as predicted by the heuristic free - energy estimates of cates and ball @xcite .",
    "it predicts the subtle @xmath3 dependence of the chain size , which was not present in the variational solution of edwards and muthukumar @xcite due to the fact that their solution did not contain enough variational parameters and hence did not reflect the translational invariance of the original hamiltonian .",
    "our aim in this paper is two fold .",
    "the first goal is to strengthen and elucidate the connection between the localization of a polymer in a random medium and that of a quantum particle .",
    "there is an extensive literature on electron localization that we would like to build bridges into .",
    "the second goal is to give further interpretation and a better physical picture of the recently discovered variational solution for a polymer in a random medium @xcite .",
    "it turns out that these two goals intertwine together by using the properties of the solutions of the schrdinger equation for a quantum particle in a random environment .    using the path integral mapping between the partition function of a gaussian polymer chain and the imaginary time schrdinger equation ,",
    "we show that the glassy behavior of the polymer chain can be understood by studying the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation with a random potential .",
    "in particular , the phenomenon of anderson localization @xcite is crucial to understanding the glassy phase .",
    "we present evidence that shows that polymer localization and glassy behavior can be traced to the dominance of exponentially localized tail states .",
    "we also explore various connections between typical glassy behavior , such as non - ergodicity and the existence of many metastable states , to the properties of the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation .    in order to describe the glass phase",
    "analytically we utilize the variational replica approach described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we further investigate and interpret the transition discovered there between a replica symmetric phase to a 1-step replica symmetry breaking phase at a critical chain length .",
    "the 1-step breaking solution describes the localized ( glassy ) phase of the polymer and corresponds to the dominance of localized tail states . in the long chain limit",
    "the lowest tail state in each realization of the disorder will dominate the partition sum . on the other hand",
    ", the replica symmetric phase corresponds to the case when a multitude of extended states dominate the partition function .",
    "our results are substantiated by a numerical solution of the problem by solving the imaginary time schrdinger equation on a lattice in one spatial dimension .",
    "the simplest model of a polymer chain in random media is a gaussian ( flexible ) chain @xcite in a medium of fixed random obstacles @xcite . in this paper",
    "we do not include a self - avoiding interaction .",
    "this model can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath4 , \\label{ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the @xmath6 dimensional position vector of a point on the polymer at arc - length @xmath7 , and where @xmath8 is the contour length of the chain ( number of links ) .",
    "the random medium is described by a random potential @xmath9 that is taken from a gaussian distribution that satisfies @xmath10 the harmonic term in the hamiltonian is included to mimic the effects of finite volume .",
    "this is important to ensure that the model is well defined , since it turns out that certain equilibrium properties of the polymer diverge in the infinite volume limit @xmath11 .",
    "the function @xmath12 characterizes the correlations of the random potential , and will depend on the particular problem at hand .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 is equal to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , and where @xmath16 is the khun bond step .    in this paper",
    "we will consider gaussian distributed random media defined by the correlation function @xmath17 here @xmath18 determines the strength of the disorder and the parameter @xmath19 controls the correlation range of the random media .",
    "for @xmath19 large ( long range correlations ) we expect to recover the exact results presented in ref .",
    "when @xmath19 is small then we have the more physically relevant case of short range correlated media . in the limit of @xmath20",
    ", @xmath12 approaches a @xmath6-dimensional @xmath2-function .",
    "this was the case studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we investigate only the case of short - range correlations , i.e. the case of small @xmath19 .",
    "once we have defined the hamiltonian for any chain configuration @xmath5 , we can write the partition sum ( green s function ) for the set of paths of length @xmath8 that go from @xmath21 to @xmath22 as @xmath23 { \\exp}(-\\beta h ) . \\label{z}\\ ] ]    all the statistical properties of the polymer will depend on the partition sum .",
    "for instance , the end - to - end distance ( or radius of gyration ) of a polymer chain that is free to move is given by @xmath24 where the overbar stands for the average of the ratio over the realizations of the random potential .",
    "this average is referred to as a quenched average , as opposed to an annealed average , where the numerator and denominator are averaged independently . in some previous studies",
    "it has been customary to replace the quenched average of certain quantities ( and in particular @xmath25 ) by the more analytically tractable annealed average .",
    "however , this replacement can be justified in the case of eq .",
    "( [ rf2av ] ) only when the system size is strictly infinite , since only in that limit can the polymer sample all of space and find the most favorable potential which will be similar to its environment in the annealed case .",
    "the main problem with this approach is that in practice we always deal with finite size systems , and in general it is difficult to assess how big the system size has to be so that the annealed average is a good approximation to the quenched average .",
    "in addition , the time it takes the chain to sample a large volume is exceedingly long and unreachable over a reasonable experimental time . in this paper",
    "we will always deal with an explicitly finite system ( both analytically and numerically ) and so we will only compute quenched averages . for very large but finite systems",
    "the free chain is said to be _ localized _ in the sense that its configuration space is dominated by a single configuration in which the chain is being trapped in a single small neighborhood .",
    "the size of the chain in an uncorrelated random potential is given by @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the volume of the system .",
    "the depth of the well entrapping the chain is approximately @xmath28 this is the binding energy per monomer .",
    "thus the binding energy of the chain is given by @xmath29 .",
    "another quantity of interest is the averaged mean squared displacement of the far end of a polymer with one end that is fixed at the origin .",
    "this is a measure of the wandering of a tethered polymer immersed in a random medium .",
    "this quantity can be written as @xmath30 it is important to distinguish between these two quantities since they measure different properties of the polymer chain .",
    "cates and ball @xcite and nattermann @xcite discussed the different behaviors of these quantities for a short - range correlated random potential using heuristic arguments . in a recent paper @xcite we have found analytically that the scaling properties of @xmath25 and @xmath31 are also very different when the disorder has long range quadratic correlations .",
    "this is because in the case of a tethered chain , the free end of the chain seeks out favorable regions in the random medium that are typically very far from the origin .",
    "when both ends are free then the entire chain will simply curl up in a favorable region in the random medium , and the end - to - end distance will not scale as fast .",
    "for the tethered chain the quenched and annealed averages are not expected to coincide even in the infinite volume limit , since a tethered chain can only sample a finite volume of size @xmath32 , and even for large @xmath8 the environment near its tail can not be adjusted since it is immobile .",
    "yet another quantity of interest is @xmath33 which measures the distance from the origin ( of the harmonic potential ) to the average ( center of mass ) position of a free chain ( more precisely of a free loop ) .",
    "it is also relevant to the related problem of a quantum particle in a random potential @xcite .",
    "the relation between the polymer and the quantum particle problems arises from the fact that the partition sum of a polymer chain can be mapped to the density matrix of a quantum particle .",
    "the mapping @xcite is given by @xmath34 then @xmath35 is the density matrix of a quantum particle at inverse temperature @xmath36 .",
    "note that the variable @xmath37 is now interpreted as the trotter ( imaginary ) time , and @xmath13 as the mass of the quantum particle . under this mapping @xmath38 can be interpreted as the average mean squared displacement from the origin of a quantum particle in a random plus harmonic potential centered at the origin .",
    "finally we would like to remind the reader the definition of the density of states for a quantum particle in a random potential .",
    "we first define the quantity @xmath39 which is the two - sided laplace transform of the density of states @xmath40 : @xmath41 this function is given by @xmath42 we will make use of these quantities in the following sections .",
    "the partition sum of the polymer chain ( [ z ] ) can be mapped to an imaginary time schrdinger equation .",
    "this mapping ( see ref .  @xcite eqs .",
    "( 3.12)-(3.18 ) ) is given by @xmath43 { \\exp}\\left(-\\beta h[{\\mathbf{r}}(u)]\\right)=   { \\langle } { \\mathbf{r}}|{\\exp}(-\\beta l\\hat{h})|{\\mathbf{r}}'{\\rangle } , \\label{map}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 so for a given realization of the random potential the polymer partition sum can be expressed as a matrix element of the imaginary - time evolution operator .",
    "the matrix elements can be expanded in a complete set of eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian operator to yield @xmath45 where @xmath46 it is clear from the above relation that all properties of the polymer chain will depend on the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian operator @xmath47 . for the problem at hand",
    "we will have to understand these properties for the case when the potential @xmath9 is random and with the correlations given in eq .",
    "( [ gaussiancor1 ] ) with a small @xmath19 .",
    "the schrdinger equation with a random potential is a well known problem that has been intensely studied for a long time @xcite .",
    "the main property that we will use is that when @xmath9 has short range correlations ( i.e. correlation length is shorter than any other length scale in the problem ) , and if the system size is infinite , then in any dimension all eigenstates with energy bellow a critical energy @xmath48 ( refered to as the mobility edge ) are exponentially localized in the form @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the localization center of the @xmath51 state , and @xmath52 is the localization length of that state .",
    "the localization length satisfies @xmath53 for @xmath54 , i.e. deep in the tail region .",
    "intuitively , it is easy to verify these last two relations for the solution of the schrdinger equation for a particle in a one dimensional , non - random , attractive @xmath2-function potential .",
    "this can be thought to represent a local minimum of the random potential . in @xmath6-dimensions",
    "one can similarly consider a potential of the form @xmath55 and the lowest energy solution of the radial equation ( with zero angular momentum ) also satisfies these relations .",
    "for @xmath56 extended states exist when @xmath57 .",
    "for @xmath58 there is no mobility edge and all states are exponentially localized .",
    "the states with energies @xmath56 are called extended since they are no longer localized but are spread over a finite fraction of the system .",
    "also , it is known that the eigenvalues of the localized states are discrete , while the eigenvalues of the extended states form a continuum .    for finite system size , or if @xmath59 in the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , the above discussion has to be modified .",
    "first , the eigenfunctions are always discrete in any dimensions .",
    "but even in one dimension as the energy increases the width of the localized states eventually becomes comparable to the system size and thus a localized particle of that energy can go from one end of the sample to the other .",
    "thus the distinction between localized and extended states becomes blurred for a finite system at energies much above the ground state .",
    "nevertheless , there will still be a qualitative difference between the low energy tail states and the higher energy states with large localization lengths . for a finite system ( or when @xmath59 ) and for any given realization of the random potential",
    "there will always be a lowest energy state which is by definition the ground state for that realization .",
    "if the volume is large ( or @xmath60 small ) it will correspond to one of the deep tail states of the infinite system .    in order to study the effect of the eigenfunctions on the physical properties of the polymer chain , we simply apply eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath8 ( or @xmath36 ) is large the partition sum is dominated by contributions due to the low energy localized states , while if @xmath8 is small then most of the contributions will come from the continuum of extended states . as @xmath8",
    "is slowly increased then fewer and fewer localized states contribute to the sum , until we attain ground state dominance at some very large @xmath8 . for simplicity",
    "let us concentrate on the diagonal elements of the evolution operator .",
    "then @xmath61 which is proportional to the probability of finding a loop of length @xmath8 passing through the point @xmath62 .",
    "since the eigenstates for low energies are localized then for large @xmath8 we can write @xmath63 this implies that the probability of finding a long loop passing through @xmath62 is concentrated around the localization centers of the low energy eigenstates .",
    "consequently , a very long polymer chain will most likely be found at the ground state localization center .",
    "when @xmath8 is small then the partition sum will be dominated by the extended states , and so the probability of finding a loop at @xmath62 should be fairly uniform throughout the system . in a later section",
    "we will analyze in detail the evolution of the partition sum with @xmath8 by solving the schrdinger equation on a lattice in @xmath64 .",
    "all the physical properties of the polymer chain can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of schrdinger equation .",
    "for instance we can write the end - to - end distance for a given realization of the random potential as @xmath65 where @xmath66 , and where @xmath67 refers to a configurational average for the case of a fixed realization of random potential .",
    "when @xmath8 is large enough so that @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the eigenvalue of the first excited state , then only the ground state contributes . in this case",
    "we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the ground state eigenfunction .",
    "it can be shown that the ground state wave function is positive definite and so in the large @xmath8 limit @xmath72 can be interpreted as the width of the ground state eigenfunction . assuming the ground state has the form given in eq .",
    "( [ localized ] ) , we can write @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the localization length of the ground state . upon averaging over all realizations of the random potential",
    "we get that @xmath75 , and so the quenched average of the end - to - end distance , in the long chain limit , is proportional to the square of the average localization length of the ground state eigenfunction . we see that for @xmath76 the average is taken over the tail states of the schrdinger equation .    when one end of the polymer is tethered to the origin then the end - to - end distance can be expanded in eigenfunctions to yield @xmath77 the presence of the term @xmath78 is crucial since if the eigenstates are localized then @xmath79 , which means that eigenstates localized far away from the origin may not contribute to the sum even if they may have very low energies . when @xmath8 is not very large the extended states will dominate the sums in eq .",
    "( [ rtexpand ] ) and the behavior of the end - to - end distance should be diffusive ( @xmath80 ) . when @xmath8 is large , but before the onset of ground state dominance , the sums in eq .",
    "( [ rtexpand ] ) will be dominated by localized eigenstates that are centered close to the origin .",
    "the free end of the polymer chain will hop between localization centers as @xmath8 increases .",
    "this behavior has been investigated using flory arguments in ref .",
    "@xcite and both authors found a weakly sub - ballistic ( @xmath81 ) behavior of the mean squared displacement . for a finite system and when @xmath8 is large enough the ground state will always dominate and we get @xmath82 . since the distance from the ground state to the origin will typically be much larger than the localization length , we find upon averaging that @xmath83 , and so the quenched average of the end - to - end distance simply converges to the distance to the localization center of the ground state .",
    "this distance is of the order of the size of the system .",
    "thus the interesting sub - ballistic @xmath8-dependence of @xmath84 arises from the contribution of excited states and not from ground state dominance as for the case of @xmath85 .",
    "the mean squared displacement defined in eq .",
    "( [ qdisp ] ) can also be expanded in eigenfunctions as @xmath86 in the large @xmath8 limit we find that @xmath87 .",
    "this is very similar to the case discussed in the previous paragraph and we find upon averaging that @xmath88 . which implies that @xmath89 becomes independent of @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath8 is small then the extended states dominate and we expect a behavior as if there is no random medium . for a polymer confined by a quadratic potential we find that @xmath90 .",
    "the relationship between the eigenstates of the schrdinger equation and the partition sum of the polymer chain can also be used to understand the behavior of the sample - to - sample variations of various physical properties of the chain .",
    "the sample - to - sample variations are important in order to assess whether the average ( over many samples ) of a physical quantity is an accurate measure of that quantity for a typical sample .",
    "for instance , the sample to sample variation of @xmath91 is defined as @xmath92 . in the same way we can define the sample - to - sample variation @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "so if the sample - to - sample variation of a physical quantity is large then that implies that the probability distribution for that quantity is highly skewed and strongly dependent on the random sample .",
    "systems which exhibit such behavior are said to have glassy properties . for simplicity",
    "if we assume ground state dominance ( @xmath8 very large ) then @xmath95 is just a measure of the sample - to - sample variation of the localization length of the ground state .",
    "also @xmath96 and @xmath97 are both a measure of the sample - to - sample variation of the distance from the origin to the ground state localization center .",
    "the crucial point here is that the sample - to - sample variations are dependent on which eigenstates dominate the partition sum , and so there should be a connection between glassy properties and the behavior of the eigenstates .",
    "in this section we review the replica approach that was used in refs . @xcite and @xcite to compute quenched averages of various physical properties of the polymer chain .",
    "our goal is to give an interpretation for this formalism in terms of the localized states picture of the corresponding schrdinger equation .    in order to compute the quenched average over the random potential",
    "we apply the replica method .",
