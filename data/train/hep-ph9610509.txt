    "a rather common feature of extended electroweak models is the prediction that one ( or more ) neutral heavy gauge bosons @xmath1 should exist .",
    "the mass of such objects is largely unknown , as it can not be theoretically estimated by a dynamical calculation , but it might be in the tev range and thus , hopefully , in the reach of future higher energy machines . clearly , the knowledge of @xmath1 parameters such as @xmath4 , the @xmath1 couplings to fermions and its mixing angle with the standard @xmath0 , is essential to test extended theories , and in particular their gauge and higgs structures .",
    "many attempts have been made to phenomenologically derive indications on the @xmath1 properties from present data , and to develop strategies to search for the manifestations of such particles in the data from next - generation high energy machines .    at present ,",
    "direct @xmath1 production searches at the @xmath5-@xmath6 tevatron collider indicate a lower limit on @xmath4 of the order of @xmath7 , which means that almost certainly the lep200 will be below the threshold for directly studying the @xmath1 peak , while the the planned next - linear @xmath8 colliders might be near the discovery level . if the cm energy were still not high enough to produce such heavy particle , @xmath1 searches would focus on possible ` indirect ' manifestations through deviations of observables from the standard model ( sm ) predictions .",
    "if such deviations were not found within the expected accuracy , then constraints on the various parameters could be derived . more optimistically , in the event that some deviation was observed , in principle such information could be used to shed light on the properties of the @xmath1 .",
    "of course , a related problem would be to have some criterion to distinguish that effect from alternative sources of nonstandard physics , potentially also contributing deviations from the sm .",
    "studies of the annihilation @xmath9 at lep1 have lead to restrictions on the @xmath10 mixing angle and the @xmath1 mass comparable with the direct searches at the tevatron and , in the perspective both of lep200 and of the next - linear - collider projects , the sensitivity of such reaction to the @xmath1 has been extensively analysed , also recently @xcite-@xcite .    with the increased @xmath8 energy available at these machines , also the reaction @xmath11 should represent a convenient tool to search for @xmath1 effects @xcite .",
    "indeed , in this process , lack of gauge cancellation among the different amplitudes due to nonstandard physics should lead to deviations from the sm cross section rapidly increasing with energy and therefore , in principle , to enhanced sensitivity to the existence of the @xmath1 if efficient @xmath3 reconstruction could be performed .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the strongest sensitivity of process ( [ proc ] ) to nonstandard effects would be obtained if initial beams were longitudinally polarized with both kinds of polarization available , so that the information from the separately measurable cross sections for left - handed and right - handed electrons could be combined . on the one hand",
    ", that would lead to stringent restrictions on the @xmath10 mixing angle . on the other hand ,",
    "model - independent separate bounds on the anomalous ( @xmath12 ) and ( @xmath13 ) couplings could be derived in case the deviation from the sm was attributed to this kind of source @xcite . in this note",
    ", we will discuss manifestations of the @xmath1 in @xmath2 at future @xmath8 colliders taking into account , in addition to propagator effects as in ref .",
    "@xcite , also the @xmath10 mixing . starting from a model - independent parametrization of the deviations from the sm amplitude , we derive bounds on nonstandard couplings and then apply such constraints to the class of extended electroweak models based on @xmath14 gauge symmetry .",
    "the high sensitivity of process ( [ proc ] ) to the parameters of such extended models , namely the @xmath10 mixing angle and the heavier neutral gauge boson mass , will be shown .",
    "in particular , the essential role of initial beams polarization in this kind of analyses will be emphasized .",
    "the sm amplitude for process ( [ proc ] ) , in born approximation , is divided into @xmath15-channel amplitude ( originating from neutrino exchange ) and @xmath16-channel amplitude ( induced by photon and @xmath0 exchange ) : @xmath17 . with @xmath18",
    "the electron ( positron ) helicity , the @xmath15-channel amplitude has the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the total energy and the @xmath22 production angle in the cm frame , @xmath23 with @xmath24 , and the explicit form of the kinematical coefficient @xmath25 is not essential for our discussion and is omitted for simplicity , as it can easily be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16-channel amplitude is given by @xmath26 and , as in the case of eq .",
    "( [ amplit ] ) , we refer to @xcite for the expression of the kinematical coefficient @xmath27 .",
    "the sm values of the couplings in eq .",
    "( [ amplis ] ) are : @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 the electroweak mixing angle ( @xmath31 ) ; @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) ; @xmath37 at the leading order .    in the extended electroweak models considered here ,",
    "the neutral vector boson sector consists , in addition to the photon , of a light @xmath38 ( with mass @xmath39 , to be identified to the @xmath0 in the limit of the sm ) , and a heavy @xmath40 ( with , expectedly , @xmath41 much greater than @xmath42 ) .",
    "both exchanges contribute to the @xmath16-channel amplitude , which now reads : @xmath43 here , @xmath38 and @xmath40 denote ` physical ' mass - eigenstates ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the corresponding couplings to @xmath3 , both assumed of the usual yang - mills form , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are , respectively , the vector and axial - vector couplings to @xmath8 .",
    "clearly , the values of these couplings depend on the extended model under consideration . in the sequel",
    ", the notation @xmath0 and @xmath1 will indicate the standard model @xmath0-particle and the heavy neutral boson weak gauge - eigenstate .    concerning",
    "the @xmath38 couplings to electrons , present constraints from experimental data @xcite indicate that their values should be rather close to the sm values @xmath48 and @xmath49 listed above .",
    "thus , the deviations @xmath50 and @xmath51 should be small numbers , to be treated as a perturbation , and the same is true for the mass - shift @xmath52 , with @xmath53 if this is due to @xmath10 mixing .    in linear approximation ,",
    "as justified by the expected smallness of these nonstandard effects , all deviations can be conveniently parametrized so as to rewrite the @xmath16-channel amplitude ( [ amplis1 ] ) in the same form as the sm one : @xmath54 where the ` effective ' gauge boson couplings @xmath55 and @xmath56 are defined as : @xmath57 @xmath58 with @xmath59 @xmath60 in eqs .",
    "( [ coupl1 ] ) and ( [ coupl2 ] ) , neglecting the gauge boson widths : @xmath61 as it will be emphasized in the sequel , this general parametrization is rather useful for phenomenological purposes , in order to discuss the deviations from the sm in the context of different classes of extended models contributing to the deviations ( [ coupl1 ] ) and ( [ coupl2 ] ) .    as indicated by the notations , in eqs .",
    "( [ deltagamma ] ) and ( [ deltaz ] ) @xmath62 and @xmath63 originate from modifications of the @xmath0 couplings plus the , generally possible , @xmath0 mass - shift from the sm value accounted by @xmath64 in ( [ chi ] ) . instead , @xmath65 and @xmath66 represent the ` direct ' contribution of the @xmath40 .",
    "one can notice that the resulting expressions for @xmath55 and @xmath56 coincide with those used in @xcite in the limit of retaining only the structure corresponding to @xmath65 and @xmath66 . from the general form of eqs .",
    "( [ amplis2])-([deltaz ] ) , nonvanishing values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 can also occur as the consequence of anomalous trilinear gauge boson couplings . actually , in effective theories of nonstandard anomalous trilinear gauge boson couplings @xcite , at the leading dimension @xmath69 .    assuming that the new physics does not involve the charged current couplings @xmath70 ,",
    "which then retain their sm values , the @xmath15-channel amplitude remains identical to eq .",
    "( [ amplit ] ) .",
    "consequently , the differential cross section of process ( [ proc ] ) at a given cm energy will have the same form as in the sm , except that in general its values will numerically differ from the sm predictions due to the nonstandard effects introduced above .",
    "accordingly , we can represent such effect by the relative deviation of the cross section ( either differential or integrated in some angular range ) from the sm prediction : @xmath71 which brings information on the free , independent , parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 in eqs .",
    "( [ deltagamma ] ) and ( [ deltaz ] ) .    if a nonvanishing value of @xmath72 was experimentally measured at some level of accuracy , the values of such parameters could be determined and possibly used to learn about the properties of the related nonstandard physics .",
    "alternatively , in the case of no observation , one could derive numerical bounds on @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and therefore constrain the various extended models , at some confidence level that depends on the attainable sensitivity of the experiment . in this",
    "regard , assuming small deviations , @xmath72 is expressed as a linear combination of @xmath67 and @xmath68 with coefficients which , generally , increase with @xmath16 .",
    "conversely , the sm cross section decreases as @xmath73 ( at least ) due to the gauge cancellation among the various amplitudes .",
    "therefore , if we parametrize the sensitivity of process ( [ proc ] ) to @xmath67 and @xmath68 by , e.g. , the ratio @xmath74 with @xmath75 the attainable statistical uncertainty on the sm cross section , such sensitivity is expected to increase with energy , even at fixed integrated luminosity ( basically , as @xmath76 ) .",
    "as discussed previously @xcite , initial electron beam longitudinal polarization , and the related possibility to individually measure the cross sections for @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) , would substantially improve the sensitivity to the couplings @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "in this regard , the measurement of @xmath80 would be of particular interest in two respects .",
    "firstly , although giving a much lower statistics as being suppressed by @xmath81-@xmath0 gauge compensation , it is most sensitive to the nonstandard effects considered here because it is free of the unmodified @xmath15-channel amplitude which numerically dominates @xmath79 and @xmath82 as well ( @xmath83 ) . secondly , by specifying @xmath84 , eq .",
    "( [ amplis2 ] ) directly shows that @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "thus , by themselves , @xmath79 ( or @xmath82 ) and @xmath80 only provide correlations among @xmath67 and @xmath68 , rather than true limits .",
    "these correlations are represented as bands in the @xmath88 plane of fig .  1 , with a width proportional to the corresponding sensitivities , and a relative angle of approximately 60 degrees .",
    "the figure clearly illustrates that , in contrast with the case where only the unpolarized cross section is measured , and therefore in principle an ` unlimited ' area is allowed to @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the combination of left - handed and right - handed cross sections is essential to obtain a finite allowed region by the intersection of the corresponding bands .",
    "numerically , fig .",
    "1 refers to the nlc energy @xmath89 , assuming @xmath90 , and to cross sections integrated over the range @xmath91 .",
    "concerning polarization , in practice the degree of initial electron longitudinal polarization @xmath92 will be quite near , but not be exactly equal , to unity .",
    "therefore , the measured cross section will be a linear combination of purely polarized cross sections @xcite : @xmath93.\\label{longi}\\ ] ] in fig .  1",
    ", the notation @xmath94 and @xmath95 refers to the values @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "such values of @xmath92 seem to be obtainable at the nlc @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath95 and @xmath94 to @xmath67 and @xmath68 has been assessed numerically by dividing the considered angular range into 10 equal ` bins ' , and defining a @xmath98 function in terms of the expected number of events @xmath99 in each bin : @xmath100 ^ 2,\\label{chi2}\\ ] ] where the uncertainty on the number of events @xmath101 combines both statistical and systematic errors as @xmath102 ( we assume @xmath103 ) . in eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) , @xmath104 , with @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "also , @xmath107 is the efficiency for @xmath3 reconstruction , for which we take the channel of lepton pairs ( @xmath108 ) plus two hadronic jets , giving @xmath109 from the relevant branching ratios .",
    "an analogous procedure is followed to evaluate @xmath110 .    as a criterion to derive allowed regions for the deviations of the coupling constants in the case no deviations from the sm",
    "were observed , and in this way to assess the sensitivity of process ( [ proc ] ) to @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we impose that @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is a number that specifies the chosen confidence level . with two independent parameters in eq .",
    "( [ correl ] ) , the @xmath113 cl is obtained by choosing @xmath114 @xcite .    from the numerical procedure",
    "outlined above , we obtain the bands allowed to @xmath67 and @xmath68 by the polarized cross sections @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( as well as @xmath82 ) depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "this figure manifestly shows the significant role of the combination of polarized measurements in restricting the limits by the intersection of the two bands .",
    "in this section , we apply the information on @xmath67 and @xmath68 given in fig .  1 to the tests of extended models where the gauge group contains at least one additional @xmath115 factor , therefore one new neutral gauge boson @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "specifically , we focus on the ` conventional ' class of models with an @xmath14 origin ( either inspired by superstring theories or not ) , where the higgs fields transform either as doublets or singlets of @xmath116 .    in general , the neutral gauge boson mass matrix in the basis of weak gauge eigenstates @xmath0 and @xmath1 takes the form @xmath117 diagonalization of ( [ matrix ] ) leads to the mass eigenstates @xmath38 and @xmath40 _ via _ the rotation @xmath118 where , by convention , @xmath119 and @xmath120 is the mixing angle : @xmath121    the mixing of the sm @xmath0 with the heavier @xmath1 leads to an ` observed ' mass of the lighter neutral gauge boson @xmath38 shifted from @xmath42 by the positive mass - shift @xmath64 introduced in eqs .",
    "( [ chi ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) .",
    "basically , model - independent information on @xmath64 can be derived , for example along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , from the radiatively corrected value of @xmath42 evaluated in the sm .",
    "the starting point is the relation @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 takes into account radiative corrections ( depending on @xmath125 , @xmath42 , @xmath126 and the higgs mass @xmath127 ) .",
    "effectively indicates the combined contribution of scalar fields to the radiative corrections to @xmath125 .",
    "] moreover , in the on - shell renormalization scheme @xcite , the electroweak mixing angle including radiative corrections is expressed as @xmath128 reflecting the weak isospin doublet or singlet character of the higgs fields .",
    "the fact that the @xmath129 mass and couplings are unaffected ( at tree level ) by the @xmath1 allows the use of the @xmath125 measured at the tevatron to extract @xmath130 in terms of @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 from eq .",

    "while being in general an independent parameter , in specific @xmath14 models where the @xmath116 doublet and singlet higgses all arise from the * 27 * representation of @xmath14 , the mixing angle @xmath120 can be related to the values of @xmath132 and @xmath41 @xcite . for @xmath41",
    "much larger than @xmath132 the relation can be written to a good approximation as : @xmath146 where , depending on the model , @xmath147 are the higgs vacuum expectation values spontaneously breaking the gauge symmetry , and @xmath148 are their @xmath149 charges .",

( [ relation ] ) represents straight lines in the plane of fig .  1 , and we explicitly report the representatives of models @xmath144 , @xmath143 and @xmath145 . as one can see , sensitivities are different : as indicated by the intersection points of these lines with the allowed bands , while @xmath94 mostly constrains the models @xmath144 and @xmath145 , @xmath95 is the most sensitive to the @xmath143 model .",
    "furthermore , the allowed range of variation of @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the specific models is defined by the intersections of the corresponding lines with the boundaries of the , model - independent , allowed region obtained from the combination of @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "one should also remark that , without the information from @xmath94 , models represented by lines almost parallel to the band determined by @xmath82 ( e.g. , the @xmath144 model ) , would remain essentially unconstrained .",
    "the ranges of @xmath67 and @xmath68 allowed to the specific models in fig .  1 can be translated into limits on the mixing angle @xmath120 and the heavier gauge boson mass @xmath41 , using eqs .",
    "( [ ddeltag])-([relation ] ) . starting our discussion from the @xmath144 model , the resulting allowed region ( at the 95% cl ) in the ( @xmath162 ) plane",
    "is limited in this case by the thick solid line in fig .  2 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath64 equal to the previously mentioned upper limit of @xmath134 , although the limiting curves do not appreciably depend on the specific value of this quantity .",
    "also , the indicative current bound on @xmath41 from direct searches is reported in this figure .",
    "2 shows that the process @xmath2 at @xmath7 has a potential sensitivity to the mixing angle @xmath120 of the order of @xmath163 , depending on the mass @xmath164 ranging up from the current lower bound of @xmath7 .",

    "( [ ddeltag ] ) and ( [ ddeltaz ] ) , for the higher masses @xmath41 much larger than @xmath165 such that the @xmath40 exchange contribution @xmath166 is much less than unity , the limiting contour is mostly determined by the modification ( [ v1 ] ) of the @xmath0 couplings to electrons .",
    "asymptotically , in the limit @xmath167 where @xmath168 , the limiting angle is @xmath169 . in the region @xmath170",
    "one has to account for ( at least ) the imaginary part of the @xmath40 propagator @xmath171 by the replacement @xmath172 in eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) . clearly , the sensitivity to @xmath120 in this mass range is dominated by the interference @xmath173 in eqs .",

    "in this situation , from the above factor we can qualitatively estimate a sensitivity to values of @xmath120 of the order of @xmath178 or less .",
    "even more stringent numerical constraints , by a factor of order 2 - 5 , would be obtained if @xmath179 , which would imply a smaller value of @xmath180 .    to complete the discussion on the bounds from process ( [ proc ] )",

    "such relation is illustrated in fig .  2 by the continuous thin lines , which correspond to @xmath182 and @xmath183 in ( [ c ] ) respectively , as representative cases .    in fig .  2",
    ", we consider also the limits on @xmath120 and @xmath41 that are expected from the annihilation into lepton pairs at @xmath184 .",
    "it should be emphasized that this process can give alternative ( and competitive ) bounds , through the combination of the ( almost @xmath120-independent ) lower bound on @xmath41 with the area allowed by eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) .. ]    up to this point , the discussion has been based on the assumption that signals of the @xmath40 were not observed within the accuracy , and the corresponding limits have been assessed .",
    "one could consider the reverse scenario , and assume that the @xmath40 is observed with a mass lower than the discovery limit in fig .",
    "2 . clearly , from higher peak cross sections and almost @xmath120-independence of the annihilation @xmath185 , we expect that such discovery should be more probable in that reaction .",
    "however , in this scenario , the usefulness of @xmath2 would be not only to confirm the existence of the @xmath40 but , especially important , to ` probe ' the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing angle with the high accuracy indicated in fig .",
    "as previously mentioned , the highest sensitivity on @xmath120 would be obtained at cm energy @xmath186 , and quantitatively we represent it in fig .  3 , where the thick and thin solid lines correspond to @xmath95 and @xmath94 respectively , both for variable @xmath139 and for the specific models @xmath144 , @xmath143 and @xmath145 . in particular , once again fig .",
    "3 shows also the complementary role of the two possible initial beam longitudinal polarizations .",
    "actually , the tiny ` around - resonance ' @xmath120-values in fig .",
    "3 are more illustrative than really quantitative , because in this case the practical analysis should be supplemented by radiative corrections in that energy range , which would require separate consideration .",
    "for the ` off - resonance ' case @xmath187 this problem should be less important , because the @xmath120-values probed there correspond to relative amplitude deviations from the sm of order @xmath188 , probably much larger than the effect of electroweak corrections @xcite .    the analogue of fig .",
    "2 for the nlc500 is depicted in fig .  4 for the case @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "the bounds from process ( [ proc ] ) at this energy are well consistent with those in fig .  2 through the anticipated approximate scaling law @xmath191 for the sensitivity @xmath192 .",
    "in figs .",
    "5 to 8 we report the results for the models @xmath145 and @xmath143 , analogous to figs .  2 and 4 .",
    "the general features pointed out above for the @xmath144 model also hold for these other cases , and the corresponding sensitivities can be directly read from the figures .    in conclusion , we have discussed the possibility of probing @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing at future @xmath8 linear colliders , _ via _ the measurement of @xmath2 cross sections with longitudinally polarized beams . while the corresponding bounds at the nlc500 are found to complement current ones , they rather rapidly improve at the higher energies .",
    "also , such bounds have been compared to the ones generally obtainable from the consideration of the nondiagonal entries of the @xmath0-@xmath1 mass - matrix , as well as with the ` superstring inspired ' extended gauge models . moreover , if the @xmath1 was discovered , presumably in @xmath185 , measurements of @xmath2 for energy around the @xmath1 peak would provide either , perhaps , a ` direct ' measurement of @xmath10 mixing or , in any case , a strong limit on such effects .",
    "these features of @xmath2 seem particularly useful in the case of the specific extended gauge models considered here , and the benefits of initial beams polarization in this kind of analysis are clearly manifest .",
