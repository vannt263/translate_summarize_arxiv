    "most natural ( biological ) molecular motors and many artificial molecular machines are powered by chemical reactions .",
    "particular ways to convert chemical energy to mechanical work vary considerably for different classes of motors .",
    "a number of prototypical models were suggested which are usually rather involved and require application of numerical methods  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce a new simple model of autonomous brownian motor in which the complexity of involved chemical processes is hidden in a single parameter of an internal potential drop , not dissimilar to how an electric battery is characterized by its voltage .",
    "our motor is essentially a brownian particle permeable for molecules of the surrounding thermal bath , which can flow in and out the particle . as a physical realization of permeable brownian particles one can mention for instance micro - gels  @xcite , and lipid vesicles like liposomes  @xcite .",
    "when a molecule is inside the particle , it experiences a potential @xmath0 similar to that in the transition - state theory .",
    "calculations are particularly simple for a linear piecewise potential @xmath0 depicted in fig .",
    "it is characterized , first , by the presence of a barrier which prevents the crossing of the particle by low - energy molecules , and , secondly , by a nonzero potential difference @xmath1 between the two sides from the barrier .",
    "as discussed below , the internal propulsion force is generated by the potential drop @xmath1 which , similar to diode devices , results in asymmetry of molecular fluxes through the particle and a nonzero average momentum it receives in unit time .    in the non - operational regime , when the average molecular flux through the particle is zero , a potential profile like that in fig .",
    "1 can be formed naturally , for instance as a result of asymmetric ion distribution across the particle .",
    "the formation of nonzero potential difference between the two sides of asymmetric lipid bilayers was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "however , it is evident that an external energy source is necessary to maintain an asymmetric charge distribution and internal potential drop in the operational regime of nonzero flux across the particle ( otherwise the system would violate the second law of thermodynamics ) .",
    "the function of a `` battery '' sustaining a stationary potential drop @xmath1 can be performed by particle - bound atp- or light driven ion pumps , capable of moving ions against potential and/or concentration gradients ( active transport )  @xcite .",
    "certain proteins , which act as ion pumps in living cells , are able to retain their function when transplanted into artificial membrane structures  @xcite .",
    "this appears to provide a technologically feasible way to synthesize permeable brownian objects with an internal potential drop .     of molecules interacting with the permeable brownian particle of size @xmath2 .",
    "coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 correspond to the left and right edges of the particle .",
    "molecules ( black circles ) `` see '' the barrier of height @xmath5 when coming from the left , and @xmath6 when coming from the right . for @xmath7 ,",
    "the particle drifts to the right.,height=117 ]    the model presented here is phenomenological in the sense that specific mechanisms of active transport involved to sustain the potential drop @xmath1 are not identified . of course",
    ", such an approach does not allow for the determination of the motor s efficiency  @xcite , but is sufficient to evaluate transport characteristics of the motor as a function of @xmath1 , which is a goal of this paper .",
    "we consider a permeable brownian particle of size @xmath2 and mass @xmath8 immersed in a thermal bath of ideal gas molecules of mass @xmath9 . the particle and molecules are constrained to move in one dimension , molecular distribution far from the particle is homogeneous with concentration @xmath10 , and the velocity distribution of molecules is maxwellian @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "molecules interact with the particle with a piecewise linear potential @xmath0 depicted in fig .",
    "the direct interaction of molecules to each other is assumed to be negligible .",
    "suppose the particle s interior corresponds to the interval @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the position of the barrier s maximum . when inside the particle , a molecule experiences a constant force @xmath16 directed to the left on the left slope @xmath17 , and to the right on the right slope @xmath18 .",
    "the right arm of the potential is shorter than the left one by @xmath19 , which results in the difference of baseline potential values ( potential drop ) @xmath20 .",
    "the idealized model potential like that in fig.1 can be formed by two electric double layers with opposite polarities , infinitely extended in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions . in a realistic case of the particle of finite dimensions ,",
    "one has to take into account a nonzero field outside the particle and , in general , a discontinuity of the potential at the particle boundary  @xcite , but these would not change the problem qualitatively .",
    "it is intuitively clear that for given geometry the average force exerted on the particle by molecules coming from the left exceeds the force from molecules coming from the right , and thus the particle would drift to the right .",
    "our aim is to find the stationary drift velocity of the particle @xmath23 .",
    "( a more simple model with a monotonic step - like potential @xmath0 shows a nonzero drift , but no friction , and therefore , in our opinion , is of less interest . )    in lowest order in the mass ratio parameter @xmath24 , which is sufficient for our purposes , one can justify the standard langevin equation for the particle s velocity @xmath25 , @xmath26 where however the fluctuating force @xmath27 is not zero - centered , so that the average stationary drift velocity is @xmath28 even for the simple model outlined above , the analytic evaluation of @xmath29 and @xmath30 is rather involved except when the potential drop is small and the barrier is high , @xmath31 the first condition allows one to evaluate the average fluctuating force in a linear approximation in @xmath1 , in which case the drift velocity can be written as @xmath32 where the parameter @xmath33 can be called the mobility .",
    "the second condition , @xmath34 , implies that the friction coefficient @xmath30 can be calculated in the limit of an infinitely high barrier , when the fluctuating force @xmath27 is zero - centered , and the standard fluctuation - dissipation relation holds @xmath35    from a practical point of view the conditions ( [ limits ] ) are of less interest since the corresponding mobility @xmath33 is very small . yet in what follows we evaluate @xmath33 assuming for the sake of simplicity that conditions ( [ limits ] ) are satisfied .",
    "one naturally expects that in this case the temperature dependence is given by an arrhenius law @xmath36 , so that our major interest will be in the pre - exponential factor @xmath37 .",
    "in this section , we evaluate the correlation function of the langevin fluctuating force @xmath27 and , using the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ fdt ] ) , the friction coefficient @xmath30 , for the case of a high barrier or low temperature , when the molecular barrier crossing is negligible .",
    "clearly , in this case of an impermeable particle the potential drop does not play any physical role and can be set to zero , @xmath38 . recall that we need @xmath30 in order to find the drift velocity of the motor with eq.([drift1 ] ) . as will be found below , for the given model @xmath39 where @xmath10 is the concentration of bath molecules .",
    "equipped with this result , the reader not interested in derivation details may skip the rest of this section . yet , since our evaluation is microscopic and exact , it is also a problem of interest of its own .",
    "it is also not entirely distracting since in the next section a similar method will be applied to evaluate @xmath29 for a permeable particle .",
    "it is convenient to write the fluctuating force as the sum of contributions from molecules coming from the left and right , @xmath40 . for the given case @xmath41",
    "is zero centered , @xmath42 , and the statistical properties of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the same . then it is sufficient to consider only one , say the `` left '' , contribution , since the correlation function of the total force can be written as @xmath45 where double brackets denote the cumulant @xmath46 .     of three @xmath47-molecules with the same initial velocity @xmath48 which are inside the particle ( @xmath49 ) .",

    "suppose the particle s left edge is fixed at @xmath3 , so that @xmath47-molecules ( coming from the left ) experience the potential @xmath0 which equals @xmath55 for @xmath49 and zero for @xmath56 , see fig .",
    "each @xmath47-molecule inside the particle ( @xmath49 ) gives the same contribution @xmath57 to the total force on the particle , which therefore can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the microscopic phase density of @xmath47 molecules .",
    "let us define the residence time @xmath60 as the time which an @xmath47-molecule with initial velocity @xmath48 spends inside the particle , i.e. in the region @xmath49 .",
    "suppose a molecule enters the particle at @xmath61 with the initial velocity @xmath48 .",
    "inside the particle the velocity changes with time as @xmath62 . at the moment when the molecule leaves the particle ,",
    "its velocity is @xmath63 .",
    "then the equation @xmath64 gives the residence time @xmath65 for brevity , we shall often suppress the argument @xmath48 of the function @xmath60 .    in order to evaluate the correlation function of the force @xmath66 ,",
    "it is convenient to express it in terms of phase density at an earlier time @xmath53 . all molecules , which at time @xmath67 are inside the particle @xmath49 , at time @xmath53 were outside in the region @xmath68 , see fig .",
    "2 . then , instead of ( [ force1 ] ) , one can write @xmath69 the advantage of this form is that it refers to molecules in the potential free region @xmath56 where the velocities of molecules are constant , so that the following relation holds @xmath70 where the notation @xmath71 is introduced for the density at time @xmath61 .",
    "this relation allows one to reduce temporal correlations to single - time correlation in phase space . for an ideal gas",
    "the latter takes the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the maxwellian distribution ( [ maxwell ] ) , and @xmath10 is the density of the gas .    with the above relations , the evaluation of the correlation function for the force @xmath66 can be done as follows . from ( [ force2 ] ) ,",
    "one gets @xmath74 where @xmath75 . using ( [ trick ] ) , we can write the cumulant of the phase density which appears here as @xmath76 from ( [ cum1])-([cum3 ] ) , after integration over @xmath77 , one obtains @xmath78 the integral of the delta function over @xmath79 equals one when @xmath80 and zero otherwise . since eq.([cum4 ] ) involves only negative @xmath81 , the right side of the condition ( [ aux1 ] ) is satisfied ( we assume @xmath82 ) , while the left side requires @xmath83 . then eq . ( [ cum4 ] ) takes the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the heaviside step - function .",
    "recalling expression ( [ residence_time ] ) for the residence time , one obtains @xmath86 which eventually gives @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the complementary error function , and the characteristic time of correlation is @xmath89 .",
    "then for the friction coefficient @xmath30 we obtain the result ( [ gamma_0 ] ) , @xmath90 it is interesting to note that this expression , which we found here for a linear potential @xmath0 ( constant repulsive force ) , coincides with @xmath30 for a similar model where molecules interact with the particle with a parabolic potential ( linear repulsive force )  @xcite . the same result for @xmath30 can be obtained from the model with instantaneous ( and therefore binary ) particle - molecule collisions  @xcite . for these models correlation functions @xmath91 are different , but the integral ( [ gamma ] )",
    "is the same .",
    "in this section we assume that the potential barrier height is large but finite , @xmath92 , so that hot molecules of the thermal bath can pass through the particle . for a non - zero internal potential drop ,",
    "@xmath93 , the fluctuating force @xmath41 in the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) is not zero - centered , which causes the particle s drift .",
    "our goal is to evaluate @xmath29 and the particle s drift velocity @xmath94 ( with @xmath30 found in the previous section ) within a linear approximation , treating @xmath1 as a small perturbation .    as in the previous section",
    ", we assume that the particle occupies the interval @xmath95 , and we write the force as the sum of contributions from molecules coming from the left and from the right , @xmath40 .",
    "consider first @xmath43 .",
    "it is convenient to analyze it as the sum of two parts , @xmath96 the first part @xmath97 comes from `` slow '' molecules with initial velocities ( before entering the particle ) less than the activation velocity @xmath98 which is the minimal speed for @xmath47-molecules to cross the barrier .",

    "namely , as illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , one can write @xmath97 at a given time @xmath67 in terms of the phase density of molecules at an earlier time @xmath53 as follows @xmath107 here the residence time @xmath60 is given by ( [ residence_time ] ) , and @xmath16 .",
    "for the potential - free region @xmath108 , then from ( [ fl1_1 ] ) and ( [ residence_time ] ) one obtains @xmath109 in the limit of impermeable particle , @xmath110 , the above equation gives the result of the elementary kinetic theory for the pressure force @xmath111 .",
    "consider now the second part @xmath99 in eq.([fl1 ] ) , which comes from fast molecules with initial velocities @xmath100 .",
    "such molecules cross the barrier and can occupy both sides of the potential hill . clearly , the average forces exerted by fast @xmath47-molecules on the left and right slopes cancel out , except for the molecules near the base of the left slope with coordinates @xmath101 , see fig .",
    "3 . let @xmath112 be the time for an @xmath47-molecule with initial velocity @xmath48 to climb to the altitude @xmath1 , @xmath113 similar to ( [ fl1_1 ] ) , one can write @xmath114 which gives @xmath115    the same method can be applied to evaluate two parts of the force @xmath116 exerted on the particle by @xmath117-molecules .",
    "the only difference is that for molecules coming from the right the potential barrier is lower , @xmath6 , and so is the activation velocity @xmath118^{1/2}$ ] . in the linear approximation ,",
    "@xmath119 where @xmath120 is the activation velocity for the @xmath47-molecules given by eq.([va ] ) . using the same argument as for @xmath47-molecules ,",
    "the contribution from slow @xmath117-molecules with @xmath121 , which can not cross the barrier , can be written as @xmath122 in the linear approximation this takes the form @xmath123 or @xmath124 the contribution from fast @xmath117-molecules with @xmath125 is similar to eq .",
    "( [ fl2 ] ) for fast @xmath47-molecules .",
    "in fact , in the linear approximation the two expressions coincide , @xmath126 combining the above results , the total average fluctuating force can be written as @xmath127 explicitly this reads @xmath128 where the dimensionless function @xmath129 is @xmath130 here the first and second terms originate from slow and fast molecules , respectively . for large @xmath81",
    "( high barrier / low temperature ) the second term is smaller than the first one by the factor of order @xmath131 and can be neglected .",
    "then , since @xmath132 , one gets @xmath133 this and the expression ( [ gamma_0 ] ) for @xmath30 give for the stationary drift velocity @xmath134 of the motor the following result @xmath135 as expected , the temperature dependence of the mobility @xmath33 is arrhenius - like .",
    "the square - root dependence of pre - exponential factor on the barrier s height @xmath5 is perhaps a less obvious result .",

    "the autonomous mesoscopic motor described in this paper is based on a permeable brownian particle which propels due to asymmetric transfer characteristics , and in this sense may be called a brownian diode . the main result ( [ result ] ) for the motor s mobility @xmath33",
    "is obtained under asymptotic conditions of a high barrier and small potential drop ( [ limits ] ) . to verify this result",
    ", we performed a one - dimensional numerical simulation similar to standard molecular dynamics with the velocity verlet algorithm . instead of periodic boundary conditions that poorly fit the problem , a very large thermal bath with a maxwellian velocity distribution ( [ maxwell ] ) and a constant density of molecules",
    "was generated in the beginning of each simulation run .",
    "the size of the bath was of order @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the duration of one simulation run , and @xmath144 is a numerical parameter of order @xmath145 .",
    "as far as the brownian particle dynamics is concerned , the difference between a bath of such size and the infinite one is that the particle immersed in the former may feel a deficit of hot molecules with velocities higher than @xmath146 . for @xmath147 ,",
    "it was found empirically that results do not depend on @xmath144 , and thus the difference with the infinite bath is expected to be negligible .",
    "the assumption of non - interacting bath molecules strongly reduces the amount of computations .",
    "it also allows some optimization by eliminating molecules with initial velocity directions away from the particle and also those which are so slow and generated so far from the particle that can not come to its proximity during the time of simulation .",
    "the ensemble average of the particle s coordinate and velocity as functions of time is taken by performing multiple runs , resetting the bath molecules with new initial conditions and averaging over the simulation runs .",
    "simulation shows a good agreement with the prediction ( [ result ] ) for small @xmath1 and when @xmath148 , see fig.4 .",
    "the agreement gets better when one takes into account the contribution of fast molecules given by the second term in eq.([exact ] ) .",
    "since @xmath149 for large @xmath81 , the corrected expression for the mobility takes the form @xmath150      for lower barrier heights , @xmath151 , the simulation shows that eqs.([result ] ) and ( [ result2 ] ) both noticeably underestimate the mobility , see fig .",
    "the discrepancy comes from the approximation of an infinitely high barrier , which we have used to calculate the friction coefficient @xmath30 , eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) . clearly , this overestimates @xmath30 and underestimates the drift velocity @xmath152 .",
    "an analytical evaluation of @xmath30 for the case of a finite barrier is feasible but somewhat cumbersome .",
    "one can instead find @xmath30 from a numerical experiment measuring velocity relaxation @xmath153 .",
    "when one uses @xmath30 found in this way , and @xmath29 given by ( [ f_general ] ) , a good agreement with the numerical experiment may be restored .",
    "( this method is not very effective for the mass ratio @xmath154 , when relaxation of the brownian particle s velocity is distinctly non - exponential . )    in our calculations , we assumed that the two slopes of the potential hill are equally steep .",
    "no qualitatively new feature appears if they are not ( provided the potential is continuous ) .",
    "as shown above , the stationary mobility does not depend on @xmath155 . respectively , for an asymmetric barrier with no potential drop , the drift may be only transient and vanishes in the long - time limit .",
    "this is confirmed by numerical simulation for regimes within and beyond the linear response . at this point , however , it perhaps should be recalled that in this study we ignored the particle s internal degrees of freedom . taking them into account",
    ", one may expect that the model would reveal new features characteristic for granular brownian motors , interacting with bath molecules via inelastic collisions  @xcite .                                for the model with instantaneous binary collisions",
