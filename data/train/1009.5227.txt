    "in the graph drawing literature , the problem of finding aesthetically pleasant drawings of graphs has been extensively studied .",
    "the graph drawing community has introduced and studied several criteria that judge the quality of a graph drawing , such as the number of crossings among pairs of edges , the number of edge bends , the maximum edge length , the total area occupied by the drawing and so on ( see the books  @xcite ) .    motivated by the fact that the edge crossings have negative impact on the human understanding of a graph drawing @xcite ,",
    "a great amount of research effort has been devoted on the problem of finding drawings with minimum number of edge crossings .",
    "unfortunately , this problem is @xmath1-complete in general @xcite .",
    "however , recent eye - tracking experiments by huang et al .",
    "@xcite indicate that the negative impact of an edge crossing is eliminated in the case where the crossing angle is greater than @xmath0 degrees .",
    "these results motivated the study of a new class of drawings , called _ right - angle drawings _ or _ rac drawings _ for short @xcite .",
    "a rac drawing of a graph is a polyline drawing in which every pair of crossing edges intersects at right angle .",
    "didimo , eades and liota @xcite proved that it is always feasible to construct a rac drawing of a given graph with at most three bends per edge . in this work , we prove that the problem of determining whether an input graph admits a straight - line rac drawing is @xmath1-hard .",

    "@xcite initiated the study of rac drawings and showed that any straight - line rac drawing with @xmath2 vertices has at most @xmath3 edges and that any graph admits a rac drawing with at most three bends per edge .",

    "they also presented upper and lower bounds on the angular resolution for several types of graphs of maximum degree @xmath8 .",

    "for the case of connected planar graphs with @xmath2 vertices and maximum degree @xmath8 , gutwenger and mutzel @xcite presented a linear time algorithm that constructs planar polyline grid drawings on a @xmath11 grid with at most @xmath12 bends and minimum angle greater than @xmath13 .",

    "these paths can only reach variable endpoints on the right side of their associated variable gadgets .",
    "more precisely , the first edge of the @xmath148-length path should cross one of the two parallel edges ( refer to the bold drawn edges of figure  [ fig : gadgets]c ) that `` trap '' it , whereas the other one should be used to reach ( passing through variable corridors ) its variable endpoint ( see figure  [ fig : example ] ) .",
    "our construction ensures that up to translations , rotations and stretchings any rac drawing of @xmath123 resembles the one of figure  [ fig : skeleton ] .",
    "it is clear that the construction can be completed in @xmath149 time .",
    "assume now that there is a rac drawing @xmath124 of @xmath123 .",
    "if the negated vertices of the variable gadget that corresponds to @xmath125 , @xmath150 , lie to the `` left '' side in @xmath124 , then variable @xmath125 is set to true , otherwise @xmath125 is set to false .",
    "we argue that this assignment satisfies @xmath120 . to realize this , observe that there exist three paths that emanate from each clause gadget . the one that emanates from the right endpoint of each clause gadget can never reach a false value .",
    "therefore , each clause of @xmath120 must contain at least one true literal , which implies that @xmath120 is satisfiable .",
    "conversely , suppose that there is a truth assignment that satisfies @xmath120 .",
    "we proceed to construct a rac drawing @xmath124 of @xmath123 , as follows : in the case where , in the truth assignment , variable @xmath125 , @xmath150 is set to true , we place the negated vertices of the variable gadget that corresponds to @xmath125 , to its left side in @xmath124 , otherwise to its right side . since each clause of @xmath120 contains at least one true literal , we choose this as the right endpoint of its corresponding clause gadget . as mentioned above",
    ", it is always feasible to be connected to its variable gadgets by paths of length two .",
    "this completes our proof .",
    "in this paper , we proved that it is @xmath1-hard to decide whether a graph admits a straight - line rac drawing .",
    "didimo et al.@xcite proved that it is always feasible to construct a rac drawing of a given graph with at most three bends per edge .",
    "if we permit two bends per edge , does the problem remain @xmath1-hard ?",
    "it is also interesting to continue the study on the interplay between the number of edges and the required area in order to fill the gaps between the known upper and lower bounds .",
