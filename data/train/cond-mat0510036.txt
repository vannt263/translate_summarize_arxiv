    "transport properties of the device consisting of the quantum dot attached to external leads are strongly affected by the appearance of the correlated many body kondo state @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon discovered long ago @xcite has manifested itself as a low temperature increase of the electrical resistance of diluted alloys . in quantum dots",
    "it shows up as an increase of conductance at low temperatures .",
    "the quantum dot devices allow the study of fundamental physics like coulomb blockade phenomenon or kondo effect in equilibrium and non - equilibrium conditions and in geometries not accessible in bulk systems . both or one of the external leads may be normal , superconducting or magnetic . in this paper",
    "we shall study the systems in which quantum dot is coupled with two ferromagnetic leads having the same or opposite magnetic polarization .",
    "spin polarized transport , especially single electron tunneling , in magnetic nanostructures has attracted much interest due to its potential applications in , for example , spintronics @xcite and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "the kondo effect in quantum dots attached to normal leads ( n - qd - n structure ) has been extensively studied both experimentally @xcite-@xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "many new effects have been predicted and observed in the transport characteristics , like splitting of the zero bias resonance under magnetic field @xcite , absence of the even - odd parity effects @xcite or out of equilibrium kondo effect @xcite .",
    "the kondo effect has also been observed in many other systems : single atom @xcite , single molecule @xcite and carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated in quantum dots attached to ferromagnetic leads @xcite , where transport properties can , in principle , be controlled with aid of the electron spin degree of freedom .",
    "recently we observe growing interest in electronic transport properties of the kondo correlated quantum dots coupled to ferromagnetic electrodes @xcite-@xcite . in such geometry",
    "the kondo resonance splits in parallel configuration @xcite ( however , some of the works @xcite predict no splitting ) , while in the anti - parallel configuration the kondo effect remains virtually the same as for nonmagnetic electrodes .",
    "the shot noise studies @xcite reveal huge differences for spin up and spin down electrons in the parallel alignment and no differences in anti - parallel configuration .",
    "it is well known that thermoelectric properties are the source of information complementary to that obtained from other transport characteristics @xcite .",
    "thermal properties ( thermopower and thermal conductance ) of the quantum dot coupled to the normal leads in the kondo regime have recently been investigated @xcite-@xcite .",
    "thermopower has been shown to be very sensitive and powerful tool to study the kondo effect .",
    "it manifests itself as an energy peak in the @xmath0 slightly below fermi energy and this leads to change of sign of the thermopower .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to study the thermoelectric properties of the quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic leads .",
    "we shall concentrate on the conductance , thermal conductance , thermopower and related quantities like tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) , thermoelectric figure of merit which value is direct sign of usefulness of the system for applications and widemann - franz ratio , which normalized value differing from 1 signals breakdown of the fermi liquid state .",
    "we show that thermopower is very different for spin up and spin down electrons in parallel configuration and is similar to the nonmagnetic case for anti - parallel one .",
    "however , for parallel alignment the total ( spin up plus spin down ) thermopower is very small compared to the anti - parallel alignment .",
    "the organisation of the rest of the paper is as follows . in ssetion",
    "ii we present the model and discuss some aspects of calculational procedure .",
    "results of calculations are presented and discussed in section iii .",
    "we end up with summary and conclusions .",
    "schematic view of the quantum dot coupled to two leads r and l , which may be magnetically polarized and/or at different temperatures and voltages is shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "we assume that the interaction energy between two electrons on the quantum dot is the largest energy in the problem and thus model the system as the @xmath1 single impurity anderson hamiltonian @xcite in the slave boson representation @xcite-@xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) denotes left ( right ) lead , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for a conduction electron with the wave vector @xmath7 , spin @xmath8 in the lead @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the hybridization matrix element between localized electron on the dot with the energy @xmath11 and conduction electron of energy @xmath12 in the lead @xmath9 .",
    "ferromagnetism of the electrodes is modeled via modified conduction electron energy @xmath13 where the magnetization points into @xmath14 direction ( the same or opposite in both leads ) .",
    "the particle current @xmath15 and the energy flux @xmath16 flowing from the lead @xmath9 to the central region can be calculated from the time derivative of charge and energy operator respectively @xcite .",
    "we use relation @xmath17 for the thermal flux @xmath18 and express all currents in terms of keldysh green functions @xcite in the standard form @xcite @xmath19 \\label{p_curr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath20 \\label{h_curr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the fourier transform of the retarded green function ( gf ) @xmath22_+ \\rangle$ ] and @xmath23 is the fourier transform of the lesser keldysh gf @xcite . @xmath24",
    "denotes the strength of the coupling between dot and the lead @xmath9 , @xmath25 is the fermi distribution function in the lead @xmath9 with the chemical potential @xmath26 and temperature @xmath27 .    in general ,",
    "when both the strong on - dot coulomb interaction and the tunneling between dot and leads occur , it is not possible to calculate @xmath28 exactly .",
    "several approximation schemes have been proposed to calculate @xmath28 .",
    "here we use recently proposed equation of motion technique for nonequilibrium gf @xcite .",
    "this technique allows calculation of both @xmath29 and @xmath21 in consistent way making similar approximations in the decoupling procedure of both @xmath29 and @xmath21 .",

    "the on - dot retarded gf reads @xmath34 with noninteracting @xmath35 and interacting self - energy @xmath36 . in order to get the splitting of the kondo resonance in the presence of the ferromagnetic leads , which is consistent with the scaling analysis",
    ", we follow ref . @xcite and replace the bare dot energy level @xmath11 by @xmath37 found self - consistently from @xmath38 $ ] in the interacting self - energy @xmath39 . in numerical results presented below we have used constant bands of width @xmath40 , @xmath41 and use @xmath42 as our energy unit in the following .    within linear response theory for the particle current and the heat flux",
    "one defines the conductance @xmath43 as equal to @xmath44 , thermopower is given by @xmath45 and the thermal conductance by @xmath46 .",
    "the linear response coefficients read @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 the leads considered here are magnetically polarized . in the following",
    "we shall characterize the degree of polarization by the parameter @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the concentration of spin @xmath8 electrons .",
    "the magnetization of both leads may point into the same direction ( parallel configuration ) or in opposite directions ( anti - parallel configuration ) .",
    "in fig.[fig2 ] linear conductance of the system in parallel configuration is calculated as a function of temperature for a number of leads polarizations @xmath52 .",
    "one observes the decrease of @xmath43 for larger values of @xmath52 .",
    "this is due to the splitting of the kondo resonance .",
    "moreover , the decrease of @xmath43 is not universal function of @xmath52 . on the other hand , in anti - parallel configuration",
    ", the conductance can be obtained from that one for unpolarized leads , as it scales according to the relation : @xmath53 for the whole temperature region .",
    "tunnel magnetoresistance is defined @xcite as the ratio @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the conductance calculated for parallel ( anti - parallel ) configuration of the leads magnetization .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as a function of polarization factor p for a number of temperatures for system characterized by @xmath56 .",
    "note that the kondo temperature itself is a function of @xmath52 . for",
    "non - polarized leads one finds @xmath57 .",
    "the dependence is not symmetric with respect to @xmath58 and changes its character with temperature . for small polarizations",
    "it is negative , as in this case @xmath59 is not much affected by the exchange field while @xmath60 is strongly suppressed due to the splitting of the kondo resonance . for large values of the polarization ,",
    "tmr is positive , as in this case @xmath59 goes to zero with @xmath61 while @xmath60 tends to finite value .",
    "the thermal conductance @xmath62 vs. temperature in the @xmath63 configuration is displayed in the fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "as one can see in the figure [ fig4 ] thermal conductance does not change much with the increasing of the leads polarization @xmath63 .",
    "this quantity is not sensitive tool for the study of the kondo effect . in the case of @xmath64 configuration for",
    "any temperature @xmath62 scales with the polarization in the same way as @xmath43 does , namely , @xmath65 .    in the fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] linear thermopower @xmath66 temperature is shown for a number of polarizations in the parallel configuration .",
    "the upper panel shows the total thermopower , the middle one the thermopower associated with spin up while lower one with spin down electrons .",
    "the @xmath67 curve corresponds to non - magnetic leads .",
    "first of all one can see that for @xmath67 and around @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the kondo scale , the thermopower reaches minimal value .",
    "it increases for elevated temperatures and eventually changes sign .",
    "this signals the disappearance of the kondo peak . as it is well known , and in similar context has already been noted by boese and fazio @xcite , the thermopower is sensitive to the curvature of the energy dependence of the density of states .",
    "this curvature is negative at high temperatures and for fermi level above the on - dot energy level , while it becomes negative at low temperatures , when the kondo resonance forms slightly above fermi level .",
    "the low temperature changes of @xmath70 with polarization can also be understood .",
    "with increasing polarization in the leads thermopower decreases to zero , except at very high temperatures where the broad maximum ( minimum ) is observed .",
    "small thermopower at low @xmath71 for increasing leads polarization is due to the splitting of the kondo resonance by the stray fields coming from the ferromagnetic leads . in this case",
    "dos around the fermi energy is almost symmetric .",
    "moreover the thermopower is mostly positive in the whole range of the temperatures except for very small leads polarizations .",
    "it is worthwhile to note additional broad maximum ( spin up ) and minimum ( spin down ) of the thermopower at temperatures below @xmath72 for small polarizations . for such polarizations the distance between kondo resonances",
    "@xmath73 is not so large ( @xmath74 ) and thermal broadening significantly affects the dos at the fermi level , thus giving rise to the observed thermopower .    for @xmath64 configuration",
    "the thermopower does not depend on the polarization and is the same as for the qd with non - magnetic leads .",
    "this can be easily understood as this quantity measures the curvature of the dos around the fermi energy , which does not change with the polarization in this case .",
    "only the height of the kondo resonance changes .    in the fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the total thermopower ( upper panel ) , that in the spin up channel ( middle panel ) , and in the spin down channel ( lower panel ) , is plotted as a function of the lead polarization in @xmath63 configuration .",
    "interestingly thermopower changes its behavior in significant way only for small values of @xmath52 and at low temperatures it even changes sign .",
    "this is attributed to the splitting of the kondo resonances . for small lead polarizations",
    "the splitting is small but significantly influences the dos around the fermi energy . for larger @xmath52",
    "the kondo peaks are far away from the fermi energy and do not change low energy dos much .",
    "so far the results for parallel configuration of the leads polarizations have been presented . however , as we have mentioned already , for anti - parallel configuration the calculated quantities either do not depend on the value of the polarization and they are the same as for non - magnetic leads ( thermopower ) or can be obtained from the solution for non - magnetic leads due to the scaling relation @xmath75 ( electric and thermal conductance ) .",
    "this is easy to understand as for such polarizations the tunneling of spin up and spin down electrons on the dot are allowed to one of the electrodes .",
    "this is true for symmetric couplings .",
    "the situation is different when there is asymmetry in the coupling to the left and right lead . in this case",
    "the electric conductance behaves similarly as in parallel configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "thermal conductance also does not change much with increasing of the lead polarization but unlike for @xmath63 configuration , where it decreases ( increases ) at low ( high ) temperature , it decreases in the whole region of the temperatures ( see discussion below the fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .    on the other hand , behavior of the thermopower in asymmetrical @xmath64 configuration ( which does not depend on @xmath52 for symmetric couplings ) is similar to the case of the @xmath63 configuration ( see fig . [ fig5 ] ) . in the fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] thermopower vs. temperature for asymmetrically coupled quantum dot with @xmath76 is plotted .    at high t thermopower",
    "goes to zero , eventually oscillating , with decreasing temperature .",
    "such behavior can be explained by the fact that for asymmetric couplings there is a splitting of the kondo resonance . in",
    "symmetrically coupled quantum dot there is an equal number of electrons with spin up and down on the dot coming from different leads and one can show that this model can be mapped onto quantum dot with non - magnetic leads . here ,",
    "when @xmath77 , due to different tunneling probabilities , quantum dot sees asymmetry in electron number with spins up and down and in this sense anti - parallel configuration is very similar to parallel one ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .    thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath78 is a direct measure of the usefulness of the material or device for thermoelectric power generators or cooling systems @xcite . for simple systems it is inversely proportional to operation temperature and thus one conveniently plots @xmath79",
    ", which numerical value is an indicator of the systems performance . in the fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we show @xmath79 as a function of temperature in the @xmath63 configuration and note that it is smaller than 1 , which signals limited applicability of the studied device .    note that polarization slightly increases @xmath79 but it never exceeds 1 .    again , in @xmath64 configuration the thermoelectric figure of merit does not depend on @xmath52 , which can be easily deduced from the definition of this quantity . on the other hand , in asymmetrical @xmath64 configuration it changes little but unlike for @xmath63 configuration , it decreases with increasing of the polarization .",
    "this is shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .",
    "finally we discuss wiedemann - franz ( wf ) law which relates thermal and electrical transport via relation @xmath80 .",
    "this law describes transport in fermi liquid bulk metals and in general is not obeyed in qd systems where the transport occurs through small confined region @xcite .",
    "however at very low temperatures , where the kondo effect develops and the ground state of the system has fermi liquid nature , the wf law is recovered . at high temperatures transport",
    "is dominated by sequential tunneling processes leading to the larger suppression of the thermal transport than the electrical one .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in the fig .",
    "( [ fig10 ] ) in @xmath63 configuration ( upper panel ) and in asymmetrical @xmath64 configuration ( lower panel ) for a number of the polarizations .    in the @xmath64 configuration with symmetric couplings to the leads",
    "wf ratio does not depend on @xmath52 due to its definition and behavior of the quantities entering into it .",
    "it is worth to note that the thermopower of the quantum dot in the kondo regime has recently been measured experimentally @xcite olbeit for nonmagnetic electrodes .",
    "the dot containing few electrons was defined in the two dimensional electron gas in which also the external electrodes were defined . in the experimental situation",
    "the charging energies ( _ i.e. _ u ) were finite and varied between 2 and 5 in units of effective coupling @xmath42 .",
    "this precludes the direct comparison with our calculations ( for p=0 ) as we have taken @xmath81 limit .",
    "experimentally one applies the bias @xmath82 between source and drain and measures thermopower as function of gate voltage @xmath83 .",
    "theoretically this dependence can be modeled by plotting @xmath70 as function of on - dot energy level @xmath84 .",
    "experimental data , shown in figure 4 of reference @xcite qualitatively agree with our calculations for @xmath67 presented in figure [ fig11 ] .    to understand the results , as the first approximation one can use so called mott formula , which states that thermopower is proportional to the logarithmic derivative of the conductance with respect to the energy evaluated at the actual fermi energy .",
    "the kondo effect shows up as additional maximum appearing in conductance @xmath85 quantum dot when the temperature decreases .",
    "it is essentially due to abrikosov - suhl resonance in the density of states , which appears at low temperatures and is located slightly above the fermi level of the leads .",
    "the slope of conductance thus changes and the thermopower changes sign .",
    "the similarity between theoretical fig.[fig11 ] and experimental fig .",
    "4 of @xcite results is very encouraging .",
    "however for qualitative comparison one has to take few energy levels on the dot , assume finite @xmath86 values and selconsistently calculate the shift of @xmath84 with changing gate voltage and nonlinear conductance and thermopower for actual value of @xmath83 and @xmath82 .",
    "this is outside the scope of the present paper",
    ". the detailed comparison between experimental data and calculations will be the subject of future work .",
    "in summary , we have studied thermal properties of the strongly correlated quantum dot coupled to the ferromagnetic leads in the kondo regime .",
    "we have found that thermopower is strongly suppressed at low temperatures due to the splitting of the kondo resonance in parallel configuration of the lead polarization . in anti - parallel configuration kondo effect",
    "behaves in the way similar to the system with non - magnetic electrodes so the results do not depend on the value of the polarization in the leads .",
    "moreover we have shown that asymmetry in the coupling to the leads in anti - parallel configuration has important consequences as it lifts spin degeneracy on the dot thus leading to the suppression of the thermopower at low temperature , similarly as in the parallel polarization configuration .",
    "finally we have checked the wiedemann - franz relation which does not hold in general , but similarly as for qd with non - magnetic leads it is recovered at low temperatures where the kondo effect develops .",
    "the results qualitatively agree with experimental data .",
