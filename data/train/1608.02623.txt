    "one of the unambiguous experiments presented by zeller and pohl@xcite is that the low temperature heat capacity of glasses differs significantly from that of crystalline solids . in pure and defect - free insulating crystals",
    "the heat capacity is proportional to @xmath13 below @xmath14k , which comes from the long wavelength phonon vibrational modes . in glasses , however , the heat capacity is the summation of two parts : long wavelength phonon contibution from debye s theory , and an excess specific heat known as the glass excitations approximated by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is of order @xmath17 , and @xmath18 vary for different materials@xcite .",
    "anderson , halperin and varmas@xcite group and phillips@xcite independently developed a microscopic phenomenological model which was later known as tunneling - two - level - system ( ttls ) model .",
    "it successfully explained the excess heat capacity of glasses , together with several other universal properties such as saturation , echoes etc .    to further verify the existence of two - level - systems , l. pich@xmath19 , r. maynard , s. hunklinger and j. j@xmath20ckle studied the influence of two - level - systems on the sound velocity in vitreous silica suprasil i at temperatures around @xmath21 and frequencies around @xmath22 .",
    "below @xmath0k , the shift of sound velocity was observed to be the logarithmic function of temperature , in both of the lower temperature resonance regime and higher temperature relaxation regime : @xmath23/c(t_0)|_{\\rm res}=\\mathcal{c}^{\\rm res}\\ln(t / t_0)$ ] , @xmath23/c(t_0)|_{\\rm rel}=\\mathcal{c}^{\\rm rel}\\ln(t / t_0)$ ] . in the high frequency",
    "lower temperature resonance regime , with @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the effective thermal relaxation time , please refer to section 2(a ) for detailed discussions ) the sound velocity increases with the increase of temperature : @xmath26 .",
    "the slope @xmath27 is independent of the input phonon frequency . in the low frequency",
    "higher temperature relaxation regime with @xmath28 , the sound velocity decreases with increasing temperature : @xmath29",
    ". such increase - decrease transition of sound velocity occurs at the transition point @xmath30 , which means the transition temperature @xmath31 is the function of phonon frequency .",
    "however , as long as the sound velocity shift @xmath23/c(t_0)$ ] enters into relaxation regime , the slope @xmath32 turns out to be independent of frequency as well .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to discuss the slope of @xmath3 dependence of sound velocity shift in relaxation and resonance regimes separately , so we assume that the slopes @xmath32 and @xmath27 are independent of frequency in both of relaxation and resonance regimes . such universal property has been observed in amorphous materials such as vitreous silica , lithium - doped kcl@xcite and silica based microscopic cover glasses@xcite , etc ..    in ttls model , the phonon strain fields are coupled to two - level - systems .",
    "if we calculate phonon - phonon correlation function ( phonon green s function ) , the pole of green s function tells us that the dispersion relation of long wavelength phonon is no longer proportional to the wave number @xmath33 , but to receive a slight shift due to the coupling between phonon strain field and two - level - systems .",
    "the shift is proportional to the real part of two - level - system susceptibility .",
    "if we use kramers - kronig relation to convert the real part of two - level - system susceptibility into the imaginary part and average over the configurations of two - level - systems , we will find that the sound velocity changes as the logarithmic of temperature@xcite .",
    "ttls model also proves that in resonance regime the sound velocity increases as the increase of temperature , while in relaxation regime it decreases as the increase of temperature .",
    "the slope ratio between resonance regime and relaxation regime is @xmath34 , which agrees quite well with the measurements of silica based microscopic cover glass@xcite .",

    "in this paper we focus on the universal shift of sound velocity and dielectric constant in low - temperature glasses .",

    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we generalize the glass two - level - system model to multiple - level - system model .",
    "then we derive our generic coupled block model by introducing the mutual rkky - type interaction between multiple - level - systems .",
    "we introduce the most important concept of this paper , namely non - elastic stress - stress susceptibility at the end of section 2(a ) . in section 3",
    "we treat rkky - type interaction as a perturbation , to set up the renormalization relation between small and large length scale non - elastic stress - stress susceptibilities . by repeating such recursion relation ,",
    "we eventually carry out non - elastic stress - stress susceptibility at macroscopic length scales . in section 4",
    "we derive the sound velocity shift in terms of non - elastic relaxation / resonance susceptibilities to prove the universal sound velocity shift in low - temperature glasses . in section 5",

    "our purpose is to discuss the universal properties in amorphous materials at low - temperatures below 10k . to explore these properties , we begin our discussion from the famous tunneling - two - level - system model ( ttls model)@xcite . in this model",

    "since the glass non - elastic susceptibility can be separated into the relaxation and resonance parts , we can calculate the contributions to sound velocity shift from the relaxation and resonance susceptibilities , separately . in eq.([7 ] ) the relaxation susceptibility is multiplied by a factor of @xmath144 . in low temperature high frequency resonance regime , @xmath145 so the prefactor of relaxation susceptibility @xmath144 makes it negligible compared to the resonance one .",
    "the sound velocity shift @xmath146 is dominated by non - elastic resonance susceptibility . in high temperature low frequency relaxation regime @xmath124 , so @xmath147 , relaxation susceptibility is no longer much smaller than the resonance one . both of the relaxation and resonance susceptibilities contribute to the sound velocity shift @xmath146 in resonance regime : @xmath148 in order to explain the universal property of sound velocity shift in low - temperature glasses , we need to investigate the properties of non - elastic relaxation and resonance susceptibilities .      within single - block considerations ,",
    "non - elastic stress tensor @xmath149 and non - elastic part of glass hamiltonian @xmath86 are simply generalizations from 2-level - system to multiple - level - system , so nothing non - trivial will be obtained within single block considerations .",

    "we further define a new stress tensor operator @xmath173 as follows , @xmath174 the above result means the new tensor operator @xmath173 is actually the non - elastic stress tensor with the presence of external strain field @xmath175 . the stress - intrinsic strain field coupling is then given by @xmath176 .",

    "such simplicity does not harm the result of our theory .",
    "second , the relative positions between different single blocks @xmath182 could be changed by external strain field , so the coefficient of non - elastic stress - stress interaction @xmath152 is changed to be @xmath183 .",
    "thus the glass total non - elastic hamiltonian with the presence of external strain is given by @xmath184 according to the definition of stress tensor operator , the super block non - elastic stress tensor is given by the derivative of super block non - elastic hamiltonian with respect to intrinsic strain field : @xmath185 . because @xmath186 is also the function of intrinsic strain field , an extra term appears in the super block non - elastic stress tensor : @xmath187 in eq.([23 ] ) we will prove that the contribution of the second term in eq.([19 ] ) to the renormalization equation of non - elastic susceptibility is negligible .",

    "the conclusion is similar for an arbitrary multiple - level - system glass hamiltonian .",

    "the above result has two important implications : ( 1 ) back to the non - elastic resonance susceptibility in the third line of eq.([7 ] ) , the term @xmath720 gives an imaginary , positive correction to the denominator of non - elastic resonance susceptibility .",
    "this positive imaginary term is self - consistent with the positive , imaginary correction of  @xmath721 \" in the dyson equation of eq.([c5 ] ) . in ultrasonic experiments with the input phonon frequency @xmath261rad / s",

    "the denominator of non - elastic resonance susceptibility receives a positive self - energy correction ,  @xmath722 \" .",
    "as we have mentioned above , usually we neglect the real part of self - energy correction , @xmath722 , because we are interested in the ultrasonic experiments with the phonon frequency @xmath261rad / s , so that @xmath722 is likely to be negligible .",
    "however , in the @xmath360 static limit , the approximation to drop the real part of self - energy correction @xmath722 in the denominator of non - elastic resonance susceptibility is no longer correct .",
    "one should also be very careful with the notation  @xmath723 \" in the denominator of non - elastic resonance susceptibility , because it is based on the assumption that @xmath722 is negligible . in conclusion",

    "although we are not able to calculate the self - energy correction for the resonance susceptibility of an arbitrary multiple - level - systen , we would like to argue that in the static limit , the full resonance susceptibility is positive due to the positive self - energy correction @xmath724 . to further strengthen our point of view",
    ", we give a further discussion on the positivity of non - elastic resonance susceptibility in zero - frequency limit .",
    "let us apply fourier transformation to convert the non - elastic susceptibility from real space to momentum space as follows , ( where we assume that for a large enough block of glass , the non - elastic susceptibility has translational invariance @xmath725 ) @xmath726 at macroscopic experimental length scales , the space - averaged non - elastic susceptibility @xmath727 can be written as the function of momentum @xmath469 , with @xmath728 : @xmath729 in the denominator of non - elastic resonance susceptibility in eq.([7 ] ) , the energy spacing @xmath730 decreases as the length scale increases . because more and more single block hamiltonians join in the super block hamiltonian , the level spacing decreases exponentially as the function of length scale @xmath62 .",
    "although we have no idea whether such a set of energy eigenvalues @xmath731 is gapless or not , we think at the late stages of real space renormalization procedures , the energy spacing @xmath732 is so small , that the real part of self - energy correction @xmath733 is large enough to prevent @xmath734 from being negative .",
    "it is at this point that we believe for arbitrary frequency @xmath260 , @xmath735 is positive and logarithmically decreases as the function of length scale @xmath62 .",
    "dyson equation is also useful in discussing phonon - phonon correlation function .",
    "the full phonon - phonon correlation function is given by dyson equation as follows , @xmath736 where @xmath138 is the non - elastic susceptibility .",
    "the imaginary part of non - elastic susceptibility is always negative for arbitrary @xmath127 : @xmath737 with the assumption that non - elastic susceptibility is invariant under so(3 ) rotational group , @xmath738 .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse phonon - phonon correlation functions receive the self - energy corrections from the non - elastic susceptibility , @xmath739 the poles of the phonon - phonon correlation functions are therefore shifted away from their original positions . according to our renormalization argument , both of the real and imaginary parts of non - elastic susceptibitilities are much smaller than @xmath740 for at least one order of magnitude : @xmath741 , @xmath742 ( see eq.([24.3 ] ) ) .",
    "we use the approximation @xmath743 to calculate the new pole of full phonon - phonon correlation function : @xmath744 this is the result which appears in eq.([11 ] ) .",
    "the real part of non - elastic susceptibility corresponds to the sound velocity shift @xmath745 , while the imaginary part corresponds to the mean free path of phonon propagation .",
    "the propagating phonon wave is given by @xmath746 since the imaginary part of non - elastic susceptibility is always negative , the phonon intensity exponentially decays , with the mean free path @xmath747 .",
    "finally , the sound velocity shift @xmath745 is given by the mean free path via kramers - kronig relation as follows , @xmath748 this result was first obtained by landau and lifshitz@xcite in 1984 .",
    "in this chapter we want to give a detailed calculation of eq.([28 ] ) in section 4 , with the assumption that the reduced imaginary part of resonance susceptibility @xmath749 is approximately a constant of frequency and temperature up to @xmath263hz and around the temperature of order 10k@xcite .",
    "we write eq.([28 ] ) in the following , @xmath750 let us use the reduced imaginary resonance susceptibility @xmath751 in the above integral .",

    "such frequency and temperature independence of @xmath755 is observed in experiments@xcite .",

    "therefore one would intuitive expect that the  logarithmic temperature dependence of sound velocity shift \" can be proved in arbitrary multiple - level - system as well .",
    "please note that the above integral eq.([e2 ] ) has two nice properties : ( 1 ) it converges exponentially fast with the increase of frequency variable @xmath758 ; ( 2 ) the  principle value \" removes the divengence when @xmath758 approaches @xmath260 .",
    "we will evaluate this principle integral in details as follows .",
    "the ultrasonic sound velocity shift experiments are measured around the temperatures of order 10k , which means the input ultrasonic phonon energy @xmath759j is much smaller than @xmath760j .",
    "thus when the integral variable @xmath758 approaches the singularity @xmath260 , we have the approximation @xmath761 .",
