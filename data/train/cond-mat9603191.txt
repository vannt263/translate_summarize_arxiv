    "persistent currents in metal rings enclosing a magnetic flux were first studied in the sixties @xcite . in ideal systems",
    "the periodicity of the magnetoconductivity is given by the flux quantum @xmath8 . in 1981 ,",
    "altshuler , aronov , and spivak @xcite renewed the interest in the topic predicting that in highly disordered systems the period of the magnetoconductivity was @xmath9 .",
    "this effect was then confirmed experimentally by sharvin and sharvin @xcite .",
    "some years later , bttiker and co - workers predicted persistent currents in a one dimensional loop of normal metal driven by an external time - dependent magnetic flux with elastic @xcite and inelastic @xcite scattering .    the predicted current in multichannel normal metal rings was analyzed as a function of disorder and temperature @xcite and it was found that disorder strongly reduces the amplitude of the persistent current .",
    "in 1990 , lvy , dolan , dunsmuir , and bouchiat @xcite found experimental evidence of these currents . in this experiment ,",
    "the response of an ensemble of mesoscopic copper rings was measured as a function of the enclosed magnetic flux .",
    "they observed a periodicity of half a flux quantum .",
    "this result motivated a great activity concerning the problem of persistent currents in an ensemble of rings , including the interaction between electrons @xcite and disorder @xcite . in 1991 , chandrasekhar _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured the current in a single , isolated gold ring . in refs . @xcite and @xcite the rings were metallic , but in 1993 mailly _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported measurement of the persistent current in a semiconductor ring .",
    "recently , new experiments were made in those rings @xcite emphasizing the differences between isolated and connected geometries .    for a metallic loop with impurities and in the difussive regime , the magnitude of the current",
    "is expected to be @xmath10 @xmath11 @xcite ( where @xmath12 is the perimeter of the ring , @xmath13 is the fermi velocity and @xmath14 is the elastic mean free path ) .",
    "this is observed in ensembles of metallic rings @xcite and in semiconductor rings @xcite but in an isolated ring @xcite a persistent current of one to two orders of magnitude larger than that predicted by theory was measured .",
    "this fact has stimulated many recent theoretical works with controversial results @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to present results in the limit of strong coupling and low carrier density which are independent of the properties of the material .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we present the model and discuss its different limits . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we show the corresponding results and finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we give their physical interpretation and the conclusions .",
    "we study a strictly one dimensional ring threaded by a magnetic field .",
    "this is such that produces a flux @xmath15 concatenated by the ring . in this system",
    "the ground state carries a steady current , which is periodic in the magnetic flux threading the loop , with period @xmath16 , the flux quantum .",
    "the current arises from the boundary conditions imposed by the magnetic flux .    to study the properties of a system of interacting electrons in a ring with @xmath17 sites we use the model proposed by hubbard @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the extended hubbard model is :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 @xmath20 are the annihilation ( creation ) operators which annihilate ( create ) an electron of spin @xmath21 on a site @xmath22 of the ring , @xmath23 = @xmath24 is the number operator that counts the number of electrons of spin @xmath21 on the site @xmath22 , and @xmath17 is the number of sites in the chain .",
    "the first term represents the kinetic energy describing the hopping of an electron from one site to a nearest neighbour site with hopping matrix element @xmath1 .",
    "we shall put @xmath25 throughout this paper , thus fixing the energy scale .",
    "the energies @xmath26 represent the disorder in the ring , and they can be any number in the range between @xmath27 $ ] with equal probability .",
    "the last term allows us to represent a long range contribution ( @xmath28 gives the extent ) where @xmath29 is the strength of the interation .",
    "when this term is zero , we have the hubbard model in which the long range contribution due to the coulomb interaction is supposed to be screened and only is retained when the electrons are in the same site giving an additional energy @xmath30 when the site is doubly occupied .    here",
    "we will consider neither the interaction through phonons nor any other solid excitation and therefore we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath31 .    if we are in the particular case where @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the ground state consists in doubly occupied levels filling up to the fermi level . in this state",
    "the total spin is the lowest possible .",
    "when @xmath34 the coulomb repulsion tends to reduce double occupancy , increasing the total spin of the ground state . in this way , the coulomb energy is reduced in a quantity proportional to @xmath30 but the kinetic energy is enhanced .",
    "then , it is found that the ground state is determined by a competition between the coulomb and kinetic energies . in one dimension and with adequate boundary conditions it is possible to demonstrate analitically @xcite that the ground state has always the minimum total spin . in our case , where the system is finite and with periodic boundary conditions , we will see that the result depends on the number of particles in the ring .    on the other hand we consider the extreme case in which the interaction intrasite is infinite .",
    "the @xmath35 limit is obtained by projecting onto a subspace where the double occupancy is not allowed .",
    "the corresponding projection operator @xmath36 is :    @xmath37    therefore , the hamiltonian of the one dimensional @xmath35 hubbard model is :    @xmath38    this restriction drastically reduces the size of the hilbert space explored from a given ansatz by the action of @xmath39 . in one dimension there is another restriction on the size of the available hilbert space .",
    "it comes from the fact that the relative positions of particles having different spin must be conserved ( up to cyclic permutations ) under the action of @xmath39 .",
    "another possibility to study the large @xmath30 limit is given by the @xmath1-@xmath2 model which allows us to work within the same hilbert subspace of the @xmath35 case @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model is a particular case of the @xmath1-@xmath40-@xmath41 model    @xmath42    when @xmath43 .",
    "the terms @xmath44 and @xmath45 have a different effect when they act on a state : the @xmath44 term connects states having a different spin order on the chain , and the @xmath45 term , being diagonal , connects the state with itself .",
    "they will be discussed in the next sections . in this way",
    ", we can study the problem for large @xmath30 perturbatively beginning from the @xmath35 hubbard model .",
    "in this section we show exact results obtained with the lanczos algorithm .",
    "the problem of the lanczos method is that in its implementation it is necessary to deal with vectors of length equal to the size of the hilbert space under consideration . since this size usually increases exponentially with the number of sites of the lattice , the technique is restricted to small chains .",
    "this method allows us to obtain the ground state and to compute the corresponding current . in this paper",
    "we shall concentrate on ground state properties only , so we will assume that the energy level separation is in general much larger than the thermal energy . in this case",
    "the current can be obtained through @xmath46 .",
    "the persistent current of the non - interacting ring can be understood if we assume that the one particle energy levels move along the free particle dispersion relation as the magnetic field increases , reducing the energy difference between the levels that correspond to the wave vectors @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , if the system possesses @xmath49 particles there is an accidental degeneracy between the states with @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the total spin of the many - body state ) .",
    "this occurs at a magnetic flux @xmath53 , in the case where @xmath54 is an odd integer or at @xmath55 when @xmath54 is an even integer .",
    "the current behaves monotonically as a function of the flux , having a discontinuity at @xmath56 .",
    "the fourier spectrum of this function has components which correspond to periodicities @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 is an integer ) , the most important of them being at @xmath59 .",
    "the coulomb interaction shifts these accidental degeneracies to other values of @xmath56 : @xmath60 . at this point",
    "there is a transition to an @xmath61 ground state , because the coulomb energy gained is greater than the kinetic energy lost by increasing the total spin .",
    "this transition can also be seen in the energy curve as a sharp peak at the transition point .    if @xmath30 is large enough , transitions to states with @xmath62 are also possible . in any case , the number of peaks in the energy curve is increased ; then , the fourier components with @xmath63 are enhanced and the fundamental periodicity is smaller than that of the free particle case .",
    "this is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "if the number of particles in the ring is an odd number and the flux is close to the accidental degeneracies , there is no change of the total spin .",
    "this is so because a change of the total spin would imply filling levels of higher kinetic energy than in the even particle case ( due to the pauli exclusion principle ) .",
    "so , at least for the smaller values of @xmath30 , there are no peaks in the energy curve .",
    "nevertheless , the transitions will occur at large values of @xmath30 , large enough so as to compensate the kinetic energy increase .",
    "this is shown in fig . 2 where we can see that the peaks appear at values of @xmath30 greater than those of the even particle case ( see fig .",
    "the effects of disorder on these properties are two : it breaks translation symmetry and favours states with minimum total spin ( the lower energy sites on the chain tend to be doubly occupied ) .",
    "so , in this case there are neither accidental degeneracies nor transitions , and the fundamental periodicity remains to be @xmath7 ( these conclusions are valid in the weak interaction regime ) .    in order to study the limit of large @xmath30 ,",
    "a natural way is to consider the situation in which @xmath35 , as we will see in the next section .      here , we review the @xmath35 hubbard model which provides a natural scenario to study the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "it is well known that infinite one dimensional systems present charge and spin separation . in other words",
    "we can say that the movement of holes leaves the relative spin order in the chain unaltered .",
    "then , the hamiltonian has a block form , each block corresponding to a definite spin order .",
    "however , when the system is finite and closed , a particle going from the last to the first site of the loop modifies the spin arrangement by a cyclic permutation . even in that case",
    "the hamiltonian has a block form , each block corresponding to a subspace where the spin order of the states can only differ by cyclic permutations of the particles .",
    "these subspaces can be labeled by an integer number @xmath64 , which is the minimum number of cyclic permutations that must be done in order to reobtain the initial state .",
    "for example , when we have four particles there are only two subspaces .",
    "they are :    @xmath65    ( empty sites are irrelevant for this analysis ) .",
    "clearly ,    @xmath66    for a general number of particles @xmath67 , it is possible to show that @xmath68 . in particular",
    "if @xmath67 is an odd number , the only possibility is @xmath69 .    within each of these subspaces two states that differ by a cyclic permutation",
    "are connected by the boundary terms of the hamiltonian :    @xmath70    in the general case , the hamiltonian within each @xmath64-subspace ( @xmath71 ) can be written as :    @xmath72    each matrix @xmath73 is equivalent to a hamiltonian of @xmath6 spinless fermions on a chain with open boundary conditions associated with eigenvalues @xmath74 and eingenvectors @xmath75 .    in terms of this basis of eigenstates the hamiltonian reads :    @xmath76    each term in the first sum describes the matrix @xmath77 .",
    "the second sum describes the matrix @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is given by :    @xmath80    because of the structure of the @xmath77 matrices , @xmath79 does not depend on the indices @xmath81 and @xmath64 .",
    "now , by using    @xmath82    where @xmath83 and @xmath54 is an integer ( @xmath84 ) , we obtain that the hamiltonian can be written as :    @xmath85    three conclusions can be drawn from this formula :    \\i ) the energy of any eigenstate of @xmath86 can be written as :    @xmath87    with @xmath88 and @xmath89 appropiate constants related to the first and second terms of ( 11 ) .",
    "\\ii ) as the flux is increased , there is crossing between the many - body levels that correspond to different values of @xmath4 , as it happens in the free particle case .",
    "in addition , the largest number of crossing occurs for the largest @xmath64 value .",
    "therefore , we can say that the ground state always belongs to the subspace with maximum @xmath64 , though possibly degenerate with others of lower @xmath64 .",
    "this result is ilustred in fig .",
    "3 with a numerical example .",
    "\\iii ) from ( [ matrixh ] ) we see that within every @xmath64-subspace the problem can be mapped onto a tight binding chain with a magnetic flux @xmath90 . therefore",
    ", the periodicity of the persistent current is @xmath91 . in particular ,",
    "the ground state periodicity is @xmath92 as it was already stated in @xcite .",
    "but we are showing that anomalous flux quantization occurs also in the excitated subespaces of the problem , corresponding to the periodicity @xmath91 ( remember that @xmath93 ) . note that in the case where we have an odd number of particles the only possibility is @xmath94 which leads to a persistent current having a periodicity @xmath95 in each subspace .",
    "we would like to point out that our analysis is completely general and can not be modified by including diagonal disorder or long range interactions ( while the double occupancy of the sites remains forbidden ) , which only affect the coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath96 . in each @xmath64-subspace , these coefficients are renormalized in the same way ( if the interaction does not depend on the spin of the particles ) , so they can not change the crossings between many body levels , driven by the magnetic flux , and the fundamental periodicity remains unaltered .",
    "here we consider the effect of a large but finite @xmath30 by means of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .    as a previous step",
    "we analyze the @xmath1-@xmath41 model , obtained by setting @xmath97 in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltj ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model does not connect states with different @xmath64 values .",
    "we have seen that the @xmath98 term favours the maximum value for @xmath64 , which corresponds to the minimum number of antiferromagnetic links .",
    "the @xmath45 term favours the minimum value for @xmath64 , which corresponds to the maximum number of antiferromagnetic links .",
    "this competition between @xmath45 and @xmath98 selects the @xmath64-subspace where the ground state belongs , modifying the periodicity of the energy and the persistent current , as we show in fig .",
    "4 . note that the periodicity of a half of quantum flux is readily stated as the antiferromagnetic coupling ( afc ) is raised , suggesting the posibility of superconducting correlations in the model . the effect associated with",
    "the afc is to renormalize the eigenvalues @xmath74 and the @xmath99 coefficients .",
    "this renormalization is different within eack @xmath64-subspace ( because the different number of antiferromagnetic links in each one of them ) , modifying the position of the crossings .",
    "the most important armonic of the energy curve as function of flux is defined by the lower value of the @xmath64 number present in the curve ( see fig .",
    "4 ) .    when we include the @xmath44 term , the hamiltonian connects states that belong to different @xmath64-subspaces . the effect is to change the spin arrangement .",
    "@xmath100 means that the characteristic time for a change in the spin arrangement is much greater than that corresponding to one hole hoppping , so the charge can hop while the spin arrangement remains almost unaltered .",
    "therefore in this limit the periodicity must be the same as in the @xmath1-@xmath41 model .",
    "the only effect in this case is the smoothing of the current discontinuities .    for a strong enough @xmath40 ,",
    "the spin arrangement changes very quickly ; then , when the charge hops , the phase coherence existing within each @xmath64-subspace dissapears . in this case , the system recovers a periodicity of one quantum flux .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "5 . note that even in this case there is a wide region of values of the afc where the periodicity correspond to a half of quantum flux .",
    "in the present work we have studied the effect of strong interactions on the properties of mesoscopic rings threaded by a magnetic flux .    in these systems we predict a fractional aharanov - bohm effect with periodicity @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is an integer in the range @xmath101 .",
    "as the strength of the afc is increased , the fundamental periodicity of the persistent current evolves from @xmath7 to @xmath92 .",
    "if the particle number is even , during this evolution , the system takes the fractional periodicities @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the particle number is odd , these intermediate transitions do not take place , as in this case there is only one value of @xmath64 , @xmath102 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this behavior has not been stated before . on a large range of values of the afc the periodicity of the persistent current correspond to a half of quantum flux , suggesting the posibility of superconducting correlations in the model .",
    "remarkably , our results are independent of the disorder and the detailed form ofthe interaction .",
    "to test our predictions it is necessary to set up an experiment where the number of particles be a well controled quantity and the interactions strong .",
    "nowadays it seems possible to construct quantum dot rings @xcite which could be an ideal tool for this purpose . in this regard",
    "we would like to mention that recently , a fractional periodicity of @xmath103 has been observed in auin rings prepared by e - beam lithography @xcite .",
    "we are indebted to a. rojo for helpful discussions during this work and to e. v. anda for important suggestions .",
    "we are also greatful to l. e. oxman and d. dalvit for a careful reading of this work .",
