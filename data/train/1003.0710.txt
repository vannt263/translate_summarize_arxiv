    "a plausible model for the central engines of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) pictures a transient , hyper - accreting disc formed around a rotating black hole ( see beloborodov 2008 for a recent review ) .",
    "the disc is a source of copious neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , which partially annihilate above the disc and turn into @xmath1 pairs , @xmath2 .",
    "this process was proposed as a possible mechanism for creating relativistic , @xmath1-dominated jets that could power observed grbs ( eichler et al .",
    "1989 ) . however , its efficiency remained unsettled .",
    "its accurate calculation requires a detailed relativistic model for the neutrino source  the accretion disc  as well as tracing the neutrino propagation in the kerr spacetime of the black hole .    a detailed relativistic model for grb discs",
    "was completed recently ( chen & beloborodov 2007 , hereafter cb07 ) .",
    "it describes the disc down to its inner edge and gives accurate energy fluxes carried away by @xmath3 and @xmath4 at all radii @xmath5 . in the present work we trace the neutrino trajectories and calculate the rate of @xmath6 annihilation around the disc .",
    "neutrino annihilation was previously calculated in a number of works ( e.g. popham , woosley & fryer 1999 . ;",
    "asano & fukuyama 2001 ; birkl et .",
    "al . 2007 ) .",
    "our work has three motivations : ( i ) a relativistic calculation of @xmath6 annihilation has never been done for a realistic accretion disc around a spinning black hole .",
    "previous works either used a toy model for neutrino source ( e.g. birkl et al .",
    "2007 ) or replaced neutrino trajectories by straight lines ( popham et .",
    "al . 1999 ) .",
    "( ii ) the efficiency of @xmath7 annihilation strongly depends on the accretion rate @xmath8 and the spin parameter @xmath9 of the black hole .",
    "it is desirable to know this dependence and identify the range of @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath7 annihilation can provide the observed energy of grb explosions .",
    "( iii ) in addition to @xmath6 annihilation , neutrinos can create @xmath1 pairs off magnetic field ( kuznetsov & mikheev 1997 ; gvozdev & ognev 2001 ) . the contribution of this process to the energy deposition rate should be included .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] describes the setup and method of our calculations .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] and summarized in section 4 .",
    "neutrinos emitted by the disc follow geodesics in kerr spacetime .",
    "the efficiency @xmath10 of their annihilation can be calculated numerically by tracing the geodesics , evaluating the local energy deposition rate [ erg  s@xmath11  @xmath12 everywhere around the black hole and then integrating over volume outside the disc to obtain the net energy deposition rate @xmath13 ( energy at infinity per unit time at infinity ) .",
    "the neutrino emission and annihilation is concentrated near the black hole , where the accretion time - scale is short and @xmath8 may be assumed to be quasi - steady . then @xmath13 depends on four parameters that specify the steady disc model : accretion rate @xmath14 , viscosity parameter @xmath15 , mass of the black hole @xmath16 , and spin of the black hole @xmath9 .",
    "as the disc matter spirals into the black hole , it is viscously heated : the gravitational energy is converted to heat .",
    "part of the heat is lost to neutrino emission , and part is stored in the disc and distributed between nuclear matter , radiation , and @xmath1 pairs , in perfect thermodynamic and nuclear statistical equilibrium .",
    "the equilibrium microphysics is determined by only three parameters : temperature @xmath17 , baryon mass density @xmath18 , and electron fraction @xmath19 ( equal to the charged nucleon fraction ) .",
    "other parameters  e.g. the electron chemical potential @xmath20 and density of @xmath1 pairs @xmath21  are derived from @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the neutrino emission peaks in the inner region of the disc .",
    "the far dominant emission mechanism is the @xmath22/@xmath23 capture onto protons / neutrons , @xmath24 the neutrino - cooled discs are nearly in @xmath25-equilibrium : the rates of the two reactions in equation  ( [ eq : reactions ] ) are practically equal , which determines the value of @xmath26 ( imshennik et al . 1967 ; beloborodov 2003 ) . in principle , all three flavors of neutrinos could be emitted from the disc , but only electron neutrinos need to be considered ; the emission rates for muon and tau neutrinos are negligible ( cb07 ) .    a detailed model for neutrino - cooled relativistic discs",
    "was developed in cb07 , and we use their model in our calculations .",
    "the approximate hydrodynamic disc equations are solved with the vertically - integrated @xmath15 prescription .",
    "the equations include radial transport of heat and lepton number .",
    "local microphysics is treated exactly : nuclear composition , electron degeneracy , neutrino emissivity and opacity etc . , using the equilibrium distribution functions for all species except neutrinos .",
    "neutrinos are modeled separately in the opaque and transparent zones of the disc , matching at the transition between the two zones .",
    "the disc model provides the vertically averaged @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( which are approximately equal to their values in the midplane @xmath27 ) and the half - thickness of the disc @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath29 spectra emitted from the neutrino - transparent ( optically thin ) zone of the disc are given by @xmath30 for neutrinos ( @xmath31 ) , and @xmath32 for anti - neutrinos ( @xmath33 ) . here",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath20 is electron chemical potential in units of @xmath39 and @xmath40 is neutrino / anti - neutrino energy in units of @xmath39 .",
    "the spectra emerging from the opaque zone are controlled by neutrino transport through the disc , which can not be reliably calculated  it depends on the unknown vertical distribution of viscous heating .",
    "fortunately , the @xmath7 annihilation rate depends only on the _ energy fluxes _ @xmath41 and @xmath42 from the disc surface , which are insensitive to the neutrino - transport details .",
    "this fact has a simple analytical explanation ( beloborodov 2008 ) .",
    "it follows from the proportionality @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the cross - section for annihilation for neutrino and anti - neutrinos with energies @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    to demonstrate that the rate of @xmath7 annihilation depends on @xmath41 and @xmath42 but not on the exact shapes of @xmath3 and @xmath29 spectra , we consider below two extreme models a and b , and they give practically the same annihilation rates :    * model  a : * neutrinos and anti - neutrinos are emitted with the same spectra as found _ inside _ the disc .",
    "the spectra are normalized so that the emerging emission carries away the known energy fluxes @xmath47 and @xmath42 . in the opaque region ,",
    "the spectra of @xmath3 and @xmath29 are described by fermi - dirac distributions .",
    "the temperature and chemical potential for @xmath3 and @xmath29 inside the disc are obtained from the numerical models of cb07 .",
    "* model  b : * neutrinos and anti - neutrinos are emitted with a thermal spectrum with zero chemical potential and temperature @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the effective surface temperature defined by @xmath50 ( @xmath51 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and the coefficient 7/8 takes into account the difference between statistics of photons and @xmath3 , @xmath29 ) .",
    "when the disc is efficiently cooled ( neutrino energy flux almost balances viscous heating ) , @xmath52 is given by the standard thin - disc model of page & thorne ( 1974 ) : @xmath53 .",
    "this regime occurs in a broad range of accretion rates @xmath54 ( cb07 ) .",
    "if @xmath55 , the disc temperature is not high enough to ignite the neutrino emitting reactions . if @xmath56 , the emitted neutrinos become trapped in the disc and advected into the black hole .",
    "our third ( simplest ) model for the neutrino source is defined as follows .",
    "* model  c : * neutrinos and anti - neutrinos are emitted with a thermal spectrum that has zero chemical potential and the following temperature , @xmath57 this model does not even require the calculation of the disc structure as @xmath58 is a known analytical function of @xmath5 ( page & thorne 1974 ) .",
    "as we show below , this simplest model gives remarkably accurate result for @xmath13 .",
    "the characteristic accretion rates @xmath59 and @xmath60 depend on the viscosity parameter @xmath15 .",
    "they were calculated in cb07 , and the numerical results are well approximated by the following formulae , @xmath61 the coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 are functions of the black - hole spin @xmath9 . for @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    in all three models a ,",
    "b and c the neutrino emission is assumed to be isotropic in the local rest frame of the disc ( which is in keplerian rotation around the black hole ) .",
    "to evaluate the @xmath7 annihilation rate at a given point we need to know the local @xmath3 and @xmath29 distribution functions .",
    "they can be obtained using the known neutrino distribution functions at the surface of the disc . to a first approximation ,",
    "neutrinos obey the collisionless boltzmann equation , because most of them do not participate in any interactions ( and eventually escape to infinity or get captured into the black hole ) .",
    "the boltzmann equation in curved spacetime has the same form as in flat spacetime .",
    "it states that the phase - space density ( or occupation number ) of neutrinos remains constant along their trajectories , @xmath70 here @xmath71 is a parameterized worldline for a @xmath3 or @xmath29 .",
    "the neutrinos emitted by the disc have huge energies compared to their rest mass and we treat them as massless particles propagating along null geodesics in kerr spacetime .",
    "we use boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath72 , where the kerr metric has the form , @xmath73 the metric tensor @xmath74 is specified by two parameters : @xmath75 and the spin parameter @xmath76 ; it is given in e.g. chandrasekhar ( 1998 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : boltzman ] ) is covariant and its solution takes into account doppler and gravitational redshifts .",
    "the null geodesics in boyer - lindquist coordinates are described by the known ordinary differential equations of first order ( e.g. chandrasekhar 1998 ) which we solve numerically .",
    "figure  [ fig : redshifts ] shows the image of the accretion disc observed from three locations near the black hole .",
    "colour represents the redshift ( or blueshift ) of neutrinos as they propagate from the emission point on the disc to the observation point .",
    "the asymmetry of the images is caused by the rotation of the black hole .    .",
