    "whilst there is some evidence that very large magnetic fields @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the electron mass and charge , respectively . ] exist in stellar objects identified as neutron stars @xcite , its origin and evolution remains poorly understood @xcite .",
    "some investigations in this area provide theoretical evidence that @xmath3 might be generated due to gravitational and rotational effects , whereas other theories estimate that is self - consistent due to the bose - einstein condensation of charged and neutral boson gases in a superstrong magnetic field @xcite . in this framework",
    "the nonlinear qed - vacuum possesses the properties of a paramagnetic medium and constitutes a source of magnetization , induced by the external magnetic field .",
    "its properties are primarily determined by the vacuum energy of virtual electron - positron pairs .",
    "because of this , a negative pressure transversal to the external field is generated @xcite in similarity with the casimir effect between metallic plates @xcite .",
    "moreover , the vacuum occupied by the external field turns out to be an `` exotic '' scenario in which processes like photon splitting @xcite and photon capture @xcite could take place .",
    "these two phenomena depend on the photon dispersion relation which differs from the light cone , due to vacuum polarization effects @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the issue of light propagation in empty space , in the presence of an external magnetic field , is similar to the dispersion of light in an anisotropic `` medium '' .",
    "the phenomenological aspects associated with this problem have been studied for a long time . in the meanwhile , other features of nonlinear electrodynamics in a superstrong magnetic field have been studied such as the dimensional reduction of the coulomb potential @xcite and the possible existence of a photon anomalous magnetic moment @xcite . however , due to the vacuum polarization effect , virtual photons can carry a magnetization as well . as a consequence",
    ", they might be a source of magnetism to the whole vacuum .",
    "motivated by this idea , we address the question in which way the virtual electromagnetic radiation contributes to the vacuum magnetization and therefore to increase the external field strength .",
    "the magnetic properties of the vacuum have been studied in @xcite for weak ( @xmath4 ) and moderate fields ( @xmath5 ) in one - loop approximation of the euler - heisenberg lagrangian @xcite which involves the contribution from virtual electron - positron pairs .",
    "the contribution of virtual photons , created and annihilated spontaneously in the vacuum and interacting with @xmath6 by means of @xmath7 , is contained within the two - loop term of the euler - heisenberg lagrangian ( see fig . [",
    "fig : mb000 ] ) .",
    "the latter was computed many years ago by ritus @xcite and has been recalculated by several authors as well @xcite . in all these works , however , it is really cumbersome to discern the individual contributions given by each virtual photon propagation mode to the euler - heisenberg lagrangian which should allow to determine the magnetism and pressure associated with each form of virtual mode . in this letter",
    "we analyze these contributions separately for very large magnetic fields @xmath8 since these allow to establish relations between the birefringence of the vacuum @xcite and the global properties of it .",
    "two - loop expansion of the euler - heisenberg lagrangian .",
    "the double lines represent the electron - positron green s functions , whereas the wavy line refers to the photon . here",
    "@xmath9 is the free maxwell lagrangian , @xmath10 represents the one - loop which gives the contribution of the virtual free electron - positron pairs created and annihilated spontaneously in vacuum and interacting with the external field .",
    "the radiative corrections ( involved in @xmath11 ) emerge from two - loop due to exchange of the virtual photons.,width=240 ]    besides the strongly magnetized vacuum , there is another interesting external field configuration which deserves to be analyzed : a supercritical electric field @xmath12 with @xmath13 . in this asymptotic region",
    "the euler - heisenberg lagrangian acquires an imaginary term which characterizes the instability of the vacuum .",
    "this phenomenon is closely related to the production of observable particles from the own vacuum .",
    "certainly , the creation of electron - positron pairs -the so - called schwinger mechanism- turns out to be the most remarkable effect predicted through this procedure @xcite .",
    "however , the imaginary part of this effective lagrangian is just a measure of the vacuum decay and does neither give the actual rate of production of particles nor the accessible decay channels @xcite .",
    "thereby not only the creation of electron - positron pairs is a plausible effect but also the emission of observable photons @xcite .",
    "the latter phenomenon was analyzed by gitman , fradkin and shvartsman @xcite .",
    "their results showed that the total probability of photon emission from the vacuum , accompanied by the creation of an arbitrary number of electron - positron pairs , is connected to the decay probability of the vacuum and thus to the imaginary part arising from the two - loop term of the euler - heisenberg lagrangian . in this context",
    "the corresponding decomposition in terms of the vacuum polarization modes is particularly illuminating because it reveals that only two of them contribute to the vacuum instability .",
    "it seems , therefore , that the vacuum could create photons with different propagation modes , an effect closely related to its own birefringence .",
    "in a magnetized vacuum the spatial symmetry is explicitly broken by the external field @xmath14 in this context , there is a vectorial basis @xmath15 @xcite which characterizes the vacuum symmetry properties and fulfills both the orthogonality condition : @xmath16 and the completeness relation : @xmath17 explicitly , the basis vectors read @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 these expressions involve the external field tensor @xmath22 and its dual @xmath23 in this basis , the vacuum polarization tensor is diagonal _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath24whereas the dressed photon green function can be expressed as @xmath25 here the @xmath26 represent the @xmath27eigenvalues and @xmath28 is the gauge parameter .",
    "this diagonal decomposition of @xmath7 defines the energy spectrum of the electromagnetic field which differs from the isotropic vacuum ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "owing to the transversality property @xmath30 the eigenvalue corresponding to the fourth eigenvector vanishes identically @xmath31 furthermore , not all the remaining eigenmodes are physical . in general , this depend on the direction of wave propagation . to show this we consider @xmath32 as the electromagnetic four vector describing a photon .",
    "the corresponding electric and magnetic fields of each mode are @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "it follows that the mode @xmath35 is a wave polarized in the transverse plane to @xmath36 whose electric @xmath37 and magnetic @xmath38 fields are orthogonal to @xmath6 as well . here",
    "the vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the components of @xmath36 across and along @xmath41 with @xmath42 . for a pure longitudinal propagation to the external field @xmath43 ,",
    "the mode @xmath44 is a longitudinal and non - physical electric wave @xmath45 on the other hand , @xmath46 is transverse since the associated electric field is @xmath47 whereas the magnetic one @xmath48 . as a consequence ,",
    "both @xmath49 and @xmath50 represent physical waves which may be combined to form a circularly polarized transversal wave . in this case",
    "both modes propagate along @xmath41 with a dispersion law independents of the magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "now , if the photon propagation involves a nonvanishing transversal momentum component @xmath51 we are allowed to perform the analysis in a lorentz frame that does not change the value @xmath52 , but gives @xmath53 and does not introduce an external electric field . in this lorentz frame , the first eigenmode @xmath54 becomes purely electric longitudinal and a non physical mode whereas @xmath55 is transverse .",
    "hence , for a photon whose three - momentum is directed at any nonzero angle with the external magnetic field , the two orthogonal polarization states @xmath55 and @xmath56 propagate . in this framework the analytical structures of the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath57 are different . as a matter of fact",
    ", the vacuum behaves like a birefringent medium with refraction indices @xcite @xmath58 here @xmath59 are the corresponding solution of the dispersion equations @xmath60 arising from the poles of @xmath61 .    considering these aspects",
    ", we analyze the euler - heisenberg lagrangian @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the free renormalized maxwell lagrangian , whereas @xmath64 denotes the one loop regularized contribution of virtual electron - positron pairs created and annihilated spontaneously in vacuum and interacting with @xmath41 @xcite . in",
    "asymptotically large magnetic fields it reads @xmath65 here @xmath66 , @xmath67 denotes the euler constant whereas @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the riemann zeta - function .",
    "the contribution of a virtual photon interacting with external field by means of the vacuum polarization tensor is expressed as @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the bare photon green function which is obtained by neglecting @xmath26 in the denominator of @xmath72 using this expression we find @xmath73where @xmath74 . to obtain the above expression",
    "we have inserted the diagonal decomposition of @xmath7 into eq .",
    "( [ twoloopunrenor ] ) and used the orthogonality condition .",
    "certainly , the quantity @xmath75 represents the interaction energy density of a virtual photon propagation mode with @xmath41 . because the analytical properties of the @xmath26 differ from each other",
    "the contribution of each mode will be different .",

    "as we shall see very shortly , the decomposition of @xmath11 is also valid in an external electric field in which case some evidence on the possible decay of the vacuum into observable photons emerges .",

    "similar to the latter the virtual radiation carries a magnetization which depends on the polarization vector .",
    "however , while an observable second mode has a paramagnetic response @xcite , our result points out that the corresponding virtual polarization generates a purely diamagnetic magnetization . besides",
    ", we have seen that the first propagation mode contributes to the magnetization of the vacuum .",
    "this is not expected for an observable mode-1 photon since its dispersion law is independent on the external field strength @xcite and therefore does not carry a magnetization .",
    "because of the anisotropy generated by @xmath41 a magnetized vacuum exerts two different pressures @xcite",
