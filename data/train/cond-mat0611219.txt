    "recent years have seen intense investigation of electron transport through semiconducting quantum dot devices  @xcite , leading in turn to a strong resurgence of interest in basic kondo physics  @xcite . the classic example  namely the spin-@xmath0 kondo effect  @xcite in which the magnetic moment of an odd - electron dot is quenched by coupling to metallic leads  was observed in quantum dots almost a decade ago . since then , a continuing goal has been to understand how _ coupled _ , multiple quantum dot systems may lead to variants of the kondo effect involving both spin and orbital degrees of freedom .    in this letter",
    "we consider probably the simplest example of such  a symmetrical double quantum dot system in which the interdot coupling is capacitive .",
    "experimental realisations of such devices have appeared in the literature @xcite , and various aspects of the rich inherent physics have been uncovered in a number of theoretical papers , see e.g.  @xcite . here",
    "we elucidate theoretically a key underlying issue : the effect on transport of sweeping the dot energy levels through a wide range of values by means of a suitably applied gate voltage .",
    "the low - temperature transport through each dot is heavily dependent on the magnitude of the gate voltage : both the characteristic low - energy kondo scale of the system , and the zero - bias differential conductance , vary significantly as the energy levels of the dots are lowered from the fermi level down .",
    "if the gate voltage is tuned in such a way that only low - energy spin , or spin / orbital - pseudospin , degrees of freedom are relevant , then the kondo scale is found ( as one usually expects ) to be exponentially - small .",
    "by contrast , at points where low - energy charge fluctuations can arise , we show that the kondo scale is much larger  even when the system is intrinsically strongly correlated ; leading thereby to correlated - electron physics on energy scales more amenable to experimental interrogation .",
    "we consider , and analyse , this behaviour within a renormalization group ( rg ) framework .",
    "the capacitively - coupled double dot model we consider consists of two correlated anderson impurities coupled by an interdot coulomb repulsion , with each dot @xmath1 coupled to its own separate lead ; viz @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the first term here describes the two metallic leads ( with @xmath1 again ) .",
    "the second term represents the tunnel coupling of each lead to its corresponding dot , and the final terms define the energies of the double dot itself ( including both intra- and interdot coulomb repulsions @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "the beauty of a typical experimental quantum dot device is that the parameters entering its effective hamiltonian are readily adjusted .",
    "in particular the dot levels @xmath7 can be tuned over a wide energy range by varying the gate voltage .",
    "it is this on which we focus here , considering eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) as a function of @xmath7 when @xmath8 .",
    "we also consider @xmath9 only , i.e. @xmath10 , since the alternative corresponds to a ` frozen impurity ' regime with the dots in essence unoccupied and the basic physics relatively straightforward .",
    "moreover , the behaviour of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) for @xmath11 above the particle - hole symmetric point @xmath12 is obtainable from that below it by a simple particle - hole transformation ; we can thus restrict our analysis to the range @xmath13 .    in the @xmath14 ( ` atomic ' )",
    "limit the dots are decoupled from their leads .",
    "the total dot occupation number @xmath15 versus @xmath11 then follows the familiar coulomb blockade ( cb ) ` staircase ' pattern , increasing stepwise from @xmath16 to @xmath17 as @xmath11 is increased .",
    "the parameter range of interest involves only the @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 steps , the edges between them lying at @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "for all points along the @xmath24 step , the degenerate @xmath25 and @xmath26 configurations lie lowest in energy , whereas on the @xmath27 step the ground state is @xmath28 ; and at the @xmath23 cb edge these states are all degenerate .    in what follows",
    "we elucidate the behaviour of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) with increasing @xmath11 when the interacting dots are connected to their leads .",
    "we show that for all @xmath8 , the ` atomic limit ' degrees of freedom described above are always quenched as @xmath29 , such that the ground state is a non - degenerate fermi liquid phase throughout regime for a critical @xmath30 , the model undergoes a quantum phase transition to a non - fermi - liquid , doubly - degenerate ` charge ordered ' phase . ]",
    "more central , however , is how the _ nature _ of this quenching depends on the gate voltage @xmath11 . near the midpoints of the cb steps ,",
    "the dot degrees of freedom ( be they spin or a combination of spin and orbital - pseudospin ) are kondo - quenched on exponentially small temperature scales .",
    "near the edges of the steps however , where charge fluctuations are important , the behaviour is markedly different .",
    "the kondo temperature @xmath31 is found to be _ much _ larger , on the order of the dot - lead hybridisation parameter @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 the host / lead density of states ) .",
    "since @xmath31 sets the natural scale below which the many - body physics arises , its enhancement means that non - trivial coherent electron transport occurs over a much larger temperature window .",
    "results discussed in the next section have been obtained using wilson s powerful numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) approach @xcite , technical discussion of how to apply which to the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "nrg is of course an iterative procedure that converges ultimately to a stable _ _",
    "fixed point__@xcite , the nature of which indicates the structure of the ground state ; and the nrg flows that lead to it ( via the unstable fixed points ) can be used to obtain static and dynamic properties on all important temperature and energy scales respectively .",
    "our results will be interpreted in terms of six distinct fixed points , the hamiltonians for which may be obtained simply by setting each of the bare parameters of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) to either @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "the simplest is the unstable free - orbital ( fo ) fixed point@xcite , where @xmath36 .",
    "four more unstable fixed points arise from @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( with fixed ratios of @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) , each corresponding to one of the atomic limit states discussed above .",
    "finally there is the stable strong - coupling ( sc ) fixed point in which @xmath41 , to which all nrg flows ultimately tend .",
    "table  [ tab : fp ] lists all these fixed points , the conditions under which they obtain , the allowed dot configurations and their degeneracies .",
    ".[tab : fp]nrg fixed points discussed in this work . for detailed discussion , see text . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as seen in table  [ tab : fp ] , the unstable fixed points divide into two sets .",
    "the first comprises the ` local moment ' ( lm ) fixed points , in which the total dot charge is fixed and hence the only possible dot degrees - of - freedom are those of spin and orbital pseudospin .",
    "the second set contains the ` valence fluctuation ' ( vf ) fixed points , in which charge fluctuations of the double dot also enter .",
    "it is the existence of these two distinct types of fixed point that leads to interesting physics , as now explained . with decreasing temperature / energy scale , all rg flows begin close to the fo fixed point ( we take the host bandwidth @xmath42 to be the largest energy scale of the model ) .",
    "but for fixed @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the subsequent flows then depend solely on the magnitude of @xmath11 ( as controlled by a gate voltage ) ; such that the flow from the final unstable fixed point to the stable sc fixed point determines the characteristic low - energy scale .    for most values of",
    "@xmath11sufficiently far from the cb edges  the nrg flows are found to pass essentially from fo to one of the lm fixed points , before crossing over to the stable sc fixed point where the dot local moments are quenched .",
    "the effective low - energy models here are thus kondoesque and the low - energy kondo scale @xmath31 on which the sc fixed point is reached is exponentially - small in @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( as considered further below ) .",
    "if however @xmath11 is instead tuned to within @xmath45 of a cb edge , the vf fixed points also come into play and the resulting physics is quite different .",
    "this is most easily seen at one of the cb edges itself , where there is no sign of any lm fixed points at all .",
    "the rg flow instead goes from fo to sc via vf , and the kondo scale is found to be a simple multiple of @xmath46 , virtually independent of the bare @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "so by tuning the system from one cb step to another , one can produce dramatic changes in its kondo scale and low - energy degrees - of - freedom , which are of course evident in both statics and dynamics .    before discussing numerical results ,",
    "we make one further remark . the kondo physics  and",
    "in particular the exponentially small @xmath31associated with the lm @xmath47 sc crossover is a well - known manifestation of strong electron correlation .",
    "but while the low - energy scales associated with the cb edges depend only on the bare energy scale @xmath46 , the corresponding electron dynamics are nonetheless still correlated . indeed for @xmath43 sufficiently large , the only region in which electron correlation is _ not _ important is @xmath48 . as we shall see below",
    ", this means that the physics associated with crossing the @xmath49 cb edge is distinct from that arising near @xmath50 @xcite : only the former involves correlated physics throughout , and it is this to which we direct the majority of our attention .",
    "we first present some static properties , beginning with the entropy . since each of the fixed points in table  [ tab : fp ] has a well defined dot degeneracy , the contribution to the entropy of the system from the dots alone , denoted by @xmath51 ,",
    "can be used to determine how the nrg flows depend on the bare parameters . in what follows , it is convenient to work with the dimensionless parameters @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1](a ) shows @xmath51 as a function of temperature for fixed @xmath55 at four representative points along the @xmath56 line .",
    "these are the three points of ` symmetry ' at @xmath57 ( centre of @xmath24 cb step , solid line ) , @xmath58 ( @xmath49 cb edge , long dashes ) and @xmath59 ( centre of @xmath27 cb step , dot - dashed ) ; plus a fourth point at @xmath60 ( short dashes ) which illustrates the behaviour slightly away from the @xmath49 cb edge . in all cases ,",
    "the high - temperature @xmath61 free - orbital behaviour is seen to cross over ultimately to the singlet strong - coupling regime below some characteristic low temperature scale , but at intermediate temperatures the physics is clearly different in each case .",
    "the @xmath57 and @xmath62 curves , corresponding to the centres of the @xmath24 and @xmath27 cb steps respectively , show the generic kondoesque behaviour described above .",
    "the long intermediate plateaus of @xmath63 each indicate a flow that passes very close to one of the two lm fixed points in table  [ tab : fp ] .",
    "specifically , for @xmath57 the fixed point is lm@xmath64 and the low - energy effective model is the one - electron @xmath65 spin / orbital kondo model @xcite . for @xmath66 by contrast , it is the lm@xmath67 fixed point that is approached , and at low energies one observes an effective pair of uncoupled @xmath68 spin - kondo models@xcite .",
    "the @xmath58 entropy curve in fig .  [ fig : fig1](a ) illustrates the distinct behaviour that arises when the rg flow passes close to a vf fixed point  in this case the vf@xmath69 fixed point of table  [ tab : fp ] .",
    "no local moment plateaus are observed ; low - energy charge fluctuations are now possible and the entropy instead drops to zero on a much higher temperature scale characterised by the hybridisation parameter @xmath46 .",
    "when one is sufficiently close to , but not at , the cb edge at @xmath58 , both vf and lm fixed points are observed , as in the @xmath60 ( @xmath70 ) curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1](a ) ; here the entropy follows the @xmath58 form at relatively high temperatures before crossing over to a characteristic @xmath63 lm shoulder and then finally zero as @xmath29 .     for @xmath71 , ( a ) entropy , @xmath51",

    "[ fig : fig1](b ) shows the @xmath77 charge susceptibility @xmath80 _ vs _ @xmath56 ( with @xmath81 ^ 2\\rangle$ ] and @xmath82 the total charge operator @xcite ) .",
    "a significant peak occurs at the cb edge at @xmath83 , reflecting the availability here of the low - energy charge degrees - of - freedom .",
    "away from this point however , the low - energy effective model involves only spin or spin / orbital degrees of freedom and @xmath84 is very small ( vanishing as @xmath85 ) .",
    "the hwhm of the peak gives an estimate of the range over which low - energy charge fluctuations are significant : here we see it is @xmath86 , and hence the charge degrees - of - freedom are important only when @xmath11 is within @xmath87 of the cb edge .",
    "we now analyse the kondo temperature @xmath31 as a function of @xmath56 ( with @xmath31 taken to be the temperature at which the impurity spin susceptibility satisfies @xmath88 ) . as seen already in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) , @xmath31 varies by many orders of magnitude as @xmath7 is lowered : this is shown more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) where we plot @xmath89 versus @xmath90 for the same fixed @xmath71 ( solid line ) . also shown is the total dot charge @xmath15 ( dotted line ) , showing the characteristic ` rounding ' of the cb staircase on coupling to the leads .",
    "it is quite clear that @xmath31 is a minimum when @xmath91 or @xmath19 , and a maximum of @xmath45 at the @xmath92 cb edge when @xmath15 can fluctuate easily between the two .",
    "note that @xmath31 also increases as one moves from the @xmath91 @xmath65 kondo regime towards the @xmath50 cb edge ; but in contrast to the behaviour just described continues to increase as @xmath7 becomes positive , reflecting the essential absence of electron correlation in the @xmath93 regime and a kondo scale naturally on the order of @xmath46 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath56 can be understood more precisely from the effective kondo models in the @xmath24 and @xmath27 regimes , obtained by straightforward schrieffer - wolff transformations and then analysed using anderson s `` poor man s '' scaling@xcite .",
    "we find in both cases that the leading exponential form of @xmath94 is @xmath95 $ ] , with @xmath96 given by @xmath97 in the strongly correlated ( @xmath98 ) limit .",

    "[ fig : fig2](a ) , for the same fixed @xmath99 and @xmath100 , each scaled by a single multiplicative factor onto the nrg result at the appropriate minimum .",
    "the strong agreement with numerical and analytical results over a wide range of @xmath56 , provides further confirmation that the low - energy physics of the dots is essentially captured by kondo models of fixed @xmath15 , except when @xmath56 is within @xmath45 of a cb edges and charge fluctuations become important .",

    "the key point here is that while the scales in the kondo regimes clearly vary significantly with all the bare parameters of the model ( as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoj ] ) ) , those associated with the vf points are largely dependent on the hybridisation strength @xmath46 only . for this reason",
    ", one would expect all the low - temperature thermodynamics of the model to be essentially independent of @xmath99 and @xmath100 near the cb edges , and we have indeed found this to be true .",
    "we now turn to dynamics , focusing on the local single - particle spectrum @xmath107 defined in terms of the retarded green function @xmath108 via @xmath109 , since this quantity probes the charge fluctuations that control transport across a given dot @xmath110 ( the model considered , where each dot hybridises to its respective lead , is formally equivalent to a 4-lead device where each dot hybridises to two leads with strength @xmath111 ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the @xmath77 zero - bias differential conductance ( @xmath112 ) of each dot is related exactly to the zero - frequency spectrum by @xmath113 ( and the spectrum at non - zero @xmath114 provides an approximation to the conductance at source - drain bias @xmath115 ) .",
    "the nrg technique can be used in practice to calculate @xmath107 on all frequency scales of interest@xcite . near the centre of each cb step , we find that the high - frequency spectrum is dominated by its hubbard satellites , corresponding physically to sequential tunnelling through the dot .",
    "since these features are readily explained simply as broadened versions of the poles arising in the atomic limit @xmath14 , we do not discuss them further here .",
    "more interesting is the low - frequency form of the spectrum , since this corresponds to coherent tunnelling through the dot mediated by the kondo effect . in figures [ fig : fig3](a),(b )",

    "thereafter , the resonance narrows until the particle - hole symmetric point at @xmath126 where @xmath31 is a minimum .",
    "in addition to the changing width of the resonance with @xmath56 , there is also a definite increase in asymmetry near the @xmath79 cb edge , since here the addition and removal of low - energy electrons to and from the ground state clearly occur with different weights .",
