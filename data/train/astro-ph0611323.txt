    "the grb afterglow as perceived in the x - ray , optical and radio wavelengths is now understood to be the result of the collision between relativistic ejecta from the gamma - ray bursts and the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "a comparison of afterglow lightcurves obtained at different wavelengths gives important information about the surrounding ism environment and the interaction processes .",
    "such analyses can also provide essential input for theoretical models .",
    "recently , the pace of this type of activity has quickened significantly , stimulated by the capabilities of the quick response and accurate localization of the grb by the _",
    "swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "this has meant that the number of grb optical afterglow detections in the first several hours by ground - based telescopes has recently increased significantly .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observations by _ swift _ of the early x - ray emissions from a number of grbs reveal a canonical behavior .",
    "the x - ray lightcurves can be divided into three distinct power law segments ( nousek et al .",
    "2006 ) . some x - ray and optical observations",
    "show that the evolution of both lightcurves changes at the same time ( blustin et al .",
    "2006 ; rykoff et al .",
    "2006 ) , however chromatic breaks were also found in some cases ( fan & piran 2006 ; panaitescu et al .",
    "the nature of the afterglow early breaks in the lightcurves is thus uncertain .",
    "a detailed comparison of changes in the evolution of the optical , radio and x - ray lightcurves should therefore be very interesting .",
    "this kind of physical study demands both a well - coordinated observational program and careful data analysis .",
    "we use grb050319 which has comprehensive observational coverage in both the x - ray and optical wavelengths may be used as just such an example .    grb050319 was detected by the burst alert telescope ( bat ) instrument onboard the _ swift _ satellite on march 19 , 2005 at 09:31:18.44 ut ( krimm et al . 2005 ) . however , a re - analysis of the bat data showed two flares , which indicated that grb050319 had already started 137 sec before the trigger .",
    "the 15350  kev fluence for the entire burst duration of @xmath8 sec has been estimated to be 1.6 @xmath9 ( cusumano et al .",

    "two breaks in the emission curves were found ( cusumano et al .",
    "the initial sharp decline can be described by a power - law with an index of @xmath10 to be followed by @xmath11 after 0.004 days since the burst . the unusually flat decline in the second part",
    "might have been caused by continuous energy injection ( cusumano et al .",

    "after receiving the grb alert message from _ swift _ and the afterglow position was reported by rykoff et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the target - of - opportunity procedures of the east - asia grb follow - up observation network ( eafon , urata et al .",
    "2005 ) were immediately carried out .",
    "a series of multi - band follow - up observations were successfully performed by the 1.05-m schmidt telescope of the kiso observatory in japan and the lulin one - meter telescope ( lot ) in taiwan .",
    "photometric @xmath0 and @xmath2 images were obtained at the kiso site with a 2k @xmath15 2k ccd camera ( urata et al . 2005 ) between 0.055 and 0.326 days after the burst . a number of parallel @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 images were obtained by lot with a pi1300 ccd camera ( kinoshita et al . 2005 ) from 0.080 to 0.413 days after the burst .",
    "the standard routine including bias subtraction and dark subtraction ; flat - field corrections were employed with the appropriate calibration data needed to process the data using iraf . the afterglow can be clearly seen in the images .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio was improved by combing the lot @xmath0 band data with median filtering .",
    "the daophot package ( stetson 1989 ) was then used to perform point - spread function ( psf ) fitting for the grb images .",
    "four field stars were used to create a psf model which was applied to the optical afterglow of each grb image . for absolute photometric calibration , we used calibrated data of the grb field obtained by the usnofs 1.0-m telescope ( henden 2005 ) . the photometric error and",
    "the systematic calibration error were included in the magnitude error estimation .",
    "figure1 shows the multi - band lightcurves of the grb050319 afterglow . besides our @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 band data ( table1 ) we also included the @xmath2 band measurements from _ rotse - iii _",

    "the gcn @xmath2 band points were re - calibrated using the grb050319 field stars reported by henden ( 2005 ) so they could be plotted on the same magnitude scale .",
    "the magnitude differences between photometric field stars in henden ( 2005 ) and in usno - a2.0 , usno - b1.0 stars are @xmath16 and @xmath17 mag , respectively . we re - measured the reference stars from greco et al . ( 2005 ) from the lot @xmath2 band images and obtained the average magnitudes and rms errors .    after fitting the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 band lightcurves to a single power - law expression @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the index and @xmath20 is the time after the burst , we get @xmath21 ( @xmath22= 2.90 for @xmath23 ) for the @xmath0 band , @xmath24 ( @xmath22= 2.60 for @xmath25 ) for the @xmath1 band , @xmath26 ( @xmath22= 5.3 for @xmath27 ) for the @xmath2 band , and @xmath28 ( @xmath22= 7.7 for @xmath29 ) for the @xmath3 band .",
    "this single power - law fitting indicates that these lightcurves , obtained with different filters have similar power - law decay even though the reduced chi - square values are relatively large .",
    "since the data sets of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 measurements are more complete , it is possible with following expression to attempt the fitting of the corresponding lightcurves with a smoothly broken power - law function :    @xmath30^{(1/k)}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 is the break time , @xmath4 and @xmath7 are the power - law indices before and after @xmath31 , @xmath32 is flux at break @xmath31 , and @xmath33 is a smoothness factor . for the @xmath1 band ,",
    "we obtain @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath31 = 0.042 @xmath6 0.058 days and @xmath36 ( @xmath22= 1.48 for @xmath37 ) . for the @xmath2 band ,",

    "this result implies a mild break in both the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 band lightcurves at around 0.04 days after the occurrence of the grb .",

    "our results show not only the clear presence of mild breaks in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 band lightcurves but a flattening trend after the break .",
    "furthermore , our @xmath2 band slope before the break ( @xmath48 ) is in agreement with the corresponding value derived by quimby et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for the interval between 0.0019 and 0.05 days after the burst .",
    "our multi - wavelength observations indicate that median colors between 0.07 and 0.35 days are @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "these values have been corrected for foreground reddening of e(@xmath52 0.011 mag ( schlegel et al .",
    "the @xmath53 and @xmath54 colors so derived are consistent with those of the typical long grbs ( simon et al .",
    "2001 ) , but the @xmath55 color is slightly redder than those of the typical long grbs ( @xmath56 ) . the larger @xmath55 value may imply a certain absorption effect because the redshift of grb050319 was determined to be 3.24 ( fynbo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 magnitudes have been further converted to fluxes using the effective wavelengths and normalizations of fukugita et al .",
    "the effect of the galactic interstellar extinction has been corrected .",
    "figure 2 shows two samples of spectral energy distribution obtained by lot at 0.13 and 0.21 days after the occurrence of grb050319 .",
    "a drop in the @xmath0 band flux at about @xmath57 can be clearly seen .",
    "we subsequently fitted the flux distribution of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands with a power - law function @xmath58 ; here @xmath59 is the flux at frequency @xmath60 with a certain @xmath20 and @xmath61 is the spectral index .",
    "we find that @xmath62 ( @xmath22= 0.05 for @xmath63 ) at 0.13 days and that @xmath64 ( @xmath22 = 2.3 for @xmath63 ) at 0.21 days .",
    "our result ( @xmath65 with a rms error 0.23 ) is consistent with the x - ray fitting value ( @xmath66 ) in a 3-@xmath67 level .    with a redshift of 3.24",
    ", the ly@xmath68 absorption feature would shift into the @xmath0 bandpass , causing reduction of the afterglow flux in the @xmath0 band . to correct for this absorption effect",
    ", we used the formulation derived by yoshii et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , in which the optical depth is a function of the observed wavelength and source redshift . with the computed optical depth in the @xmath0 band , and a spectral slope of @xmath69",
    ", we found the expected @xmath0 band magnitude after ly@xmath68 absorption to be @xmath70 at 0.13 days .",
    "this value compares very well with our observed value of @xmath0 = 21.26 @xmath6 0.17 at 0.13 days after correction for galactic extinction .",
    "the drop at the b band is hence fully produced by the ly@xmath68 absorption and no spectral breaks should have taken place during our observation .",
    "it is important to note that _ swift _ found two breaks at 0.004 and 0.313  days after the burst in the x - ray afterglow observations ( cusumano et al .",
    "2006 ) , but we only found a single break in our @xmath1 and @xmath2 lightcurves ( see figure 1 ) . in the following since there are more data points available for the @xmath2 band data we will focus on this .",
    "it is useful to remember that @xmath4 = @xmath71 and @xmath72 at the break time of @xmath31 = 0.04  days .",
    "the slope @xmath4 ( = @xmath50.84 ) is consistent with the typical range of @xmath74 to @xmath75 for many well observed grbs . according to the standard afterglow model relating the power - law index ( @xmath19 ) to the power - law index ( @xmath76 ) of an electron spectrum ( zhang & mszros , 2004 ; dai & cheng , 2001 ) , the corresponding value for @xmath77 is @xmath76 = 2.1 , which is in agreement with the constant - density ism model with slow cooling in which @xmath78 2 for @xmath79 ( @xmath80 is the typical frequency ; @xmath81 is the optical frequency ; @xmath82 is the cooling frequency ) . in light of the xrt observations ,",
    "the first break was likely caused by the transition from the tail end of the low energy prompt emission to the afterglow phase ( zhang et al .",
    "however , it is important to note that the x - ray break at 0.004 days ( where the steeper slope becomes shallow ) is not accompanied by an @xmath2 band break . at the same time , the power - law decay slope in the x - ray ( @xmath83 5.53 ) and the @xmath2 band ( @xmath83 0.84 ) are quite different .",
    "this is an indication not only that the behaviors of the x - ray afterglow and optical afterglow of the grb050319 event are different , but also suggested that the afterglow phase already dominated the optical bands when the optical emission was first detected .",
    "the power law index becomes shallow after the break ( @xmath31 = 0.04 days ) . neither the jet ( rhoads 1999 ) nor the break frequencies across the optical wavelength ( sari et al . ,",
    "1998 ) suitably explain the break they see in the grb050319 lightcurves .",
    "as discussed before , the x - ray lightcurve between the two breaks 0.004 and 0.313  days after the burst is also characterized by shallow decay .",
    "zhang et al . ( 2006 ) suggested that such behavior is related to continuous energy injection into the ism . for a long - lasting central engine ,",
    "the energy injection rate is @xmath84 and with @xmath85 ( zhang & mszros 2001 ) . for slow cooling in the ism",
    ", the temporal index can be expressed as : @xmath86 / 4 = [ ( q-1 ) +    { ( 2+q)\\beta ] / 2},$ ] when @xmath87 . using this formulation , zhang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) obtained @xmath88 = 0.6 and @xmath89 = 2.4 from the x - ray observations .",
    "with @xmath19 = @xmath50.48 and @xmath61 = @xmath51.08 from the @xmath2 band observations , we find that @xmath88 = 0.72 and @xmath89 = 2.12 .",
    "the results not only indicate that the electron spectrum power law index is the same before and after the break , they also compare well with the results of zhang et al .",
    "these results indicate that the shallow decays evidenced by both x - ray and optical afterglows could be of a similar origin , related to a continuous energy injection mechanism .    according to the energy injection model ,",
    "would also expect an x - ray break at the time of the optical flattening break , because the onset of the energy injection should also alter the x - ray temporal index .",
    "however , such an x - ray break is not observed , which suggests that some modifications to the injection model may be needed .",
    "as mentioned in @xmath90 4.1 , the x - ray break at 0.004 days was not accompanied by a break in the @xmath2 lightcurve .",
    "although a chromatic break in the x - ray was found at 0.004 days and in the optical region at 0.04 days , the lightcurves at both wavelengths indeed showed shallow decay after the breaks , which can be explained by the energy injection model .",
    "however , it is difficult for energy injection from 0.004 days to 0.04 days to affect only high energies .",
    "this difficulty indicates that energy injection is an imperfect mechanism for explaining the shallow optical or x - ray phase associated with the grb050319 event .",
    "several models have recently been proposed to explain the shallow decay effect .",
    "using the multiple - subjet model ( nakamura , 2000 ) , toma et al .",
    "( 2006 ) invoked the superposition of afterglows from many off - axis subjets .",
    "eichler & granot ( 2006 ) favored a combination of the tail of prompt emission model with the afterglow emissions observed from a viewing angle outside the edge of the jet .",
    "these arguments hence suggest that the multiple - subjet model and the patchy - shell model ( kumar & piran , 2000 ) might provide a theoretical basis for explaining the observed shallow decays in the x - ray and optical lightcurves .",
    "it is interesting to note that in order to sustain the shallow decay process these models all require high gamma - ray efficiency ( 75 - 90@xmath91 ) ; additional mechanisms such as prior activity ( ioka et al . 2005 ) and time - dependent shock generation ( fan & piran , 2006 ) have been also proposed .",
    "comprehensive multi - wavelength observations , such as those reported here , provide important keys to improve these models .    finally , the second break in the x - ray emissions ( @xmath92 0.313  days after the burst ) , has been interpreted as being due to an unusual flat jet break ( cusumano et al .",
    "2006 ) , zhang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) however provided an alternate explanation , a sudden cessation of the energy injection . in both interpretations",
    ", the corresponding break should appear in both the x - ray and optical lightcurves .",
    "this effect can not be clearly identified in our measurements until 0.413 days after the burst .",
    "the lack of data for the subsequent time interval could lead to uncertainty in the power - law fitting .",
    "we thus can not fully exclude the existence of a second break in the optical lightcurves . however , panaitescu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have studied several afterglows .",
    "they found the shallow power - law decay evidenced by the x - ray emissions to steepen about 0.04@xmath50.17 days after the burst , although there was no accompanying break found in the optical range .",
    "they suggest that such chromatic x - ray breaks may be common .",
    "the chromatic breaks ( e.g. the shallow x - ray phase becomes steeper , with no accompanying optical break ) may be caused by differences in the x - ray and optical outflow ( panaitescu et al .",
    "2006 ) , or by changes in the typical electron energy parameters ( the so - called microphysical parameters ) at the end of energy injection ( panaitescu 2006 ) .      *",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 band lightcurves displayed unusual shallow decays .",
    "* the @xmath2 lightcurve can be described by a smooth broken power - law function .",
    "@xmath93 becomes shallow ( @xmath94 ) 0.04 days after the occurrence of the grb .",
    "* the shallow decay observed in the x - ray and optical lightcurves may have a similar origin related to energy injection .",
    "however , our observations indicate that there is still a major puzzle remaining concerning the chromatic breaks in the @xmath2 band lightcurve ( at 0.04  days ) and the x - ray lightcurve ( at 0.004  days ) . *",
    "our calculations revealed that the drop in spectral energy distribution was fully caused by a shift in the ly@xmath68 absorption to the @xmath0 bandpass at @xmath95 = 3.24 .",
