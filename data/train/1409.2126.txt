    "nitrogen is one of the major contributors to the chemical richness of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and it is able to form a large variety of molecules in the gas phase , including hcn , hnc , cn , and nh@xmath14 . the apolar n@xmath12 molecule , probably the most abundant n - bearing molecular in the interstellar gas , is nearly unobservable directly by using conventional spectroscopic techniques , so its protonated ion diazenylium , n@xmath12h@xmath0 , is usually used as a tracer of n@xmath12 . diazenylium has been observed towards many different astronomical sources @xcite , while ammonium , nh@xmath15 , has been only detected towards the cold dark core b1-b @xcite .",

    "<S> we report the tentative detection in space of the nitrosylium ion , no@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the observations were performed towards the cold dense core barnard 1-b . </S>",
    "<S> the identification of the no@xmath0 @xmath1=21 line is supported by new laboratory measurements of no@xmath0 rotational lines up to the @xmath1=87 transition ( 953207.189mhz ) , which leads to an improved set of molecular constants : @xmath2mhz , @xmath3khz , and @xmath4mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the profile of the feature assigned to no@xmath0 exhibits two velocity components at 6.5 and 7.5 km s@xmath5 , with column densities of @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath8 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> new observations of no and hno , also reported here , allow to estimate the following abundance ratios : @xmath9(no)/@xmath9(no@xmath0)@xmath10 , and @xmath9(hno)/@xmath9(no@xmath0)@xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this latter value provides important constraints on the formation and destruction processes of hno . </S>",
    "<S> the chemistry of no@xmath0 and other related nitrogen - bearing species is investigated by the means of a time - dependent gas phase model which includes an updated chemical network according to recent experimental studies . the predicted abundance for no@xmath0 and </S>",
    "<S> no is found to be consistent with the observations . </S>",
    "<S> however , that of hno relative to no is too high . </S>",
    "<S> no satisfactory chemical paths have been found to explain the observed low abundance of hno . </S>",
    "<S> hscn and hncs are also reported here with an abundance ratio of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have searched for nno , no@xmath12 , hnno@xmath0 , and nnoh@xmath0 , but only upper limits have been obtained for their column density , except for the latter for which we report a tentative 3-@xmath13 detection .    to appear in the astrophysical journal october 20 , 2014 </S>"
