    "weak gravitational lensing is a powerful method to map the distribution of mass in the universe , regardless of its nature or state ( for reviews see mellier 1999 ; bartelmann & schneider 2001 ; refregier 2003 ) .",
    "the apparent shapes of background galaxies become distorted as their light travels near mass concentrations along their line of sight to the earth .",
    "the well - known shearing of galaxies , in which intrinsically circular sources would be seen as elongated ellipses , is induced by an amount proportional to the second derivative of the projected foreground gravitational potential .",
    "such distortion has been measured around individual galaxy clusters (  wittman  2001 ; wittman  2003 ; bacon & taylor 2003 ; brada  2005 ; wittman  2006 ) and , in a statistical fashion , by large scale structure ( recent measurements include massey  2004 ; van waerbeke  2005 ; heymans  2005 ; jarvis  2006 ; hoekstra  2006 ; semboloni  2006 ; hetterscheidt   2006 ; schrabback  2006 ; kitching  2007 ; massey  2007b ) .",
    "a higher - order effect , known as `` flexion '' , is also emerging as a probe of the distribution of mass on small scales , and particularly in the inner cores of galaxy clusters ( goldberg & natarajan 2002 ; irwin & schmakova 2003 ; goldberg & bacon 2005 ; bacon  2006 ; irwin & schmakova 2006 ; okura , umetsu & futamase 2006 ; goldberg & leonard 2007 ) .",
    "variation in the shear signal across the width of a background galaxy causes bending in its apparent shape .",
    "this is the next term in a lensing expansion that leads towards the formation of an arc , as in strong lensing .",
    "the flexion is sensitive to the third derivative of the projected gravitational potential .",
    "precise image analysis techniques are required to detect weak gravitational lensing , because the shapes of galaxies are changed by the effect by only a few percent .",
    "in fact , the lensing contribution to the shape is about an order of magnitude smaller than the dispersion of galaxies intrinsic morphologies and the spurious distortions introduced by typical imperfections in telescopes .",
    "the widely used shear measurement method by kaiser , squires & broadhurst ( ksb , 1995 ) has been successful in many contexts , but contains several documented shortcomings : it is found to be insufficiently accurate to measure shears with a desired accuracy of less than 1% (  bacon  2001 ; erben  2001 ; heymans  2005 ( step1 ) ; massey  2007a ( step2 ) ) , and it is mathematically ill - defined for realistic point spread functions (  kaiser 2000 ; kuijken 1999 ; hirata & seljak 2003 ) .",
    "several new shear measurement methods are being developed , to fully exploit future space - based weak lensing surveys with hst or the proposed snap , dune or jdem missions , and ground - based wide - field surveys such as those with megacam , ctio des , vista darkcam , pan - starrs and lsst .",
    "a review of the various shear measurement methods is found in step2 , along with their division into `` active '' and `` passive '' categories .",
    "active techniques work by modelling galaxies as intrinsically circular , then shearing the models until they most closely match the observed ellipticities .",
    "passive methods work by measuring the apparent ellipticities of objects as well as higher order shape statistics , which are used to calibrate the ellipticities .",
    "flexion measurement methods are still in relative infancy .",
    "initial attempts to mathematically describe the flexion distortion ( goldberg & natarajan 2002 ; irwin & shmakova 2003 ) were formidably complicated .",
    "a passive estimator has been constructed by okura , umetsu & futamase ( 2006 ) , and further expanded by goldberg & leonard ( 2007 ) .",
    "a completely different , probabilistic approach is taken by irwin & shmakova ( 2006 ) and irwin , shmakova & anderson ( 2006 ) . however , several important features in these approaches remain to be developed , and they remain mathematically complex ; it is therefore desirable to find a formalism which allows maximum physical insight into the problem .",
    "an advance towards this was made by goldberg & bacon ( 2005 ) , who related flexion to the formalism of cartesian shapelets ( refregier 2002 ; refregier & bacon 2002 ) .",
    "shapelets contain all the mechanics necessary to deconvolve galaxies and flexion estimators from the effects of a psf .",
    "the active method of goldberg & bacon ( 2005 ) and goldberg & leonard ( 2007 ) has been used to successfully detect the flexion signal .",
    "the mathematics has a simpler form , although it is still not as elegant as possible .    here",
    ", we present the image manipulations of lensing theory in terms of the `` polar shapelets '' formalism ( refregier 2003 ; massey & refregier 2005 ) .",
    "this suggests a complete , orthonormal set of basis functions into which any galaxy shapes can be decomposed .",
    "it also provides a neat way to deconvolve arbitrary galaxy shapes from an arbitrarily complicated psf , so we can set out under the assumption that this problem is solved .",
    "polar shapelets then provide a natural representation for both shear and flexion operations , with simple mathematical forms that yield transparent physical interpretation . the complex number approach used throughout polar shapelets matches very conveniently with the complex ellipticity notation of blandford ( 1991 ) now ubiquitous in shear literature , and with the complex formalism of flexion developed by bacon   ( 2006 ) .",
    "a complete software package to decompose images into polar shapelets is available from the shapelets web siterjm / shapelets ] .",
    "we then exploit the inherent symmetries of polar shapelets to explore a comprehensive range of passive measurement methods for both shear and flexion . to create a shear or flexion estimator",
    ", we simply need to find a combination of shapelet coefficients that has the desired properties under each transformation .",
    "we generally keep the estimators as close as possible to linear in the image , to minimise both noise and bias in the final result .",
    "the shapelet methodology resembles a continuation of the ksb method to higher order .",
    "however , the inclusion of higher order shape information , and a complete parametrization of galaxy morphology , provides several new opportunities to improve on ksb , and to remove its instabilities .",
    "some of the shear and flexion estimators that we describe are also independent , and can be obtained simultaneously for each galaxy",
    ". these will provide invaluable new cross - checks for systematics in the data analysis , which are unique to this method , and can also be combined to increase the overall ratio of signal to noise .",
    "as we shall discuss , one of the shear estimators has already been proved highly successful in a blind test on simulated images containing an applied shear , as part of the step programme ( heymans  2006 ; massey  2007a ) .",
    "we defer detailed testing of the remainder until the next step cycle .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in  [ lensing ]",
    "we describe the shapelet decomposition and the action of weak gravitational lensing in shapelet space . in  [ shear_estimators ] we derive several possible weak shear estimators , and discuss the performance of a key estimator on the simulated step images . in  [ flexion_estimators ] we derive several possible weak flexion estimators .",
    "we conclude in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we shall first describe the action of weak shears and weak flexions in polar shapelet space .",
    "this is seen as a mixing of power between an object s various shapelet coefficients , or equivalently how much those coefficients change under each operation .",
    "to first order , a vector of shapelet coefficients is acted upon by simple matrices that contain small mixing components in their off - diagonal terms .",
    "for example , a shear takes some power from the circular ( @xmath0 ) shapelet coefficients and redistributes it into the elliptical ( @xmath1 ) shapelet coefficients , turning a circle into an ellipse .    the effect of shear as an abstract coordinate transformation has already been derived in cartesian shapelet space by refregier ( 2003 ) , and in polar shapelet space by massey & refregier ( 2005 ) . here , we review this shear in the physical context of weak gravitational lensing .",
    "operators to perform flexion have been derived in cartesian shapelet space by goldberg & bacon ( 2005 ) . here , we translate those results into polar shapelet space , where they become much simpler .",
    "the flexion operators fit naturally into the complex notation of polar shapelets . furthermore , the two distinct types of flexion identified by bacon  ( 2006 ) mix distinct sets of polar shapelet coefficients , which can be separated elegantly .        in practice ,",
    "the shapelet expansion must be truncated , and we typically use coefficients with @xmath10 less than some maximum amount or , conveniently in this context , @xmath13 less than some amount .",
    "the latter , `` diamond''-shaped truncation scheme is a cut in the _ total _ number of oscillations , so is more consistent with arguments concerning information content in fourier space , like the @xmath14 and @xmath15 of equation  ( 24 ) in refregier ( 2003 ) .",
    "it is also better matched to the empirically observed distribution of power in shapelet space for typical galaxies . in figure",
    "[ fig : basis_functions ] , the absolute values of coefficients with @xmath16 or 9 and low @xmath17 ( which are not shown ) would typically be higher than those towards the top - right and bottom - right of those that are shown . for galaxy shapes this truncation scheme therefore improves the data compression ratio , or the accuracy of image recovery using a fixed number of free parameters .",
    "in the absence of lensing , we first assume that galaxy shapes are randomly oriented .",
    "this must be true for a sufficiently large and widely - separated ensemble of galaxies , if there is no preferred direction in the universe , and if galaxies are not intrinsically aligned .",
    "the unlensed ensemble of galaxies can not contain any angular information , so must therefore have mean shapelet coefficients @xmath18 that obey @xmath19 thus , only the @xmath0 coefficients of the ensemble average are populated .",
    "this is the only information available about an unlensed galaxy ensemble .",
    "it encodes the galaxies flux @xmath20 and radial profile ( see massey & refregier 2005 ) , including their average size @xmath21 and higher order shape moments like @xmath22 as defined by okura , umetsu  & futamase ( 2006 ) .",
    "all of these will be used later .",
    "although the following quantities will be zero on average for the population , for each galaxy we can also define an unweighted centroid @xmath23 ellipticity @xmath24 and trefoil @xmath25 the numerator of which is the @xmath8-invariant quantity @xmath26 obtained by setting @xmath27 and @xmath28 in equations  ( 56 ) and ( 58 ) of massey & refregier ( 2005 ) .      as a bundle of light rays from a distant galaxy passes through a foreground gravitational field characterized by the lensing potential @xmath29 , the rays are differentially deflected , and the apparent shape of the galaxy is distorted (  bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) .",
    "the shape of the galaxy @xmath30 is sheared by an amount @xmath31    positive values of the real part , @xmath32 , correspond to elongations of the galaxy along the @xmath33-axis and compressions along the @xmath34-axis .",
    "positive values of the imaginary part , @xmath35 , correspond to elongations of the galaxy along the line @xmath36 and compressions along the line @xmath37 . in both cases ,",
    "negative values indicate the opposite .",
    "this complex shear notation ( and an analogous form of complex ellipticity ) is useful in weak lensing because both components are expected to be zero on average in the absence of a signal . in this case , a modulus - argument form for shear would have a zero modulus , but no well - defined angle .",
    "the complex form also arises very naturally in polar shapelet space .",
    "as shown in massey & refregier ( 2005 ) , under a weak lensing shear @xmath38 to first order , the shapelet coefficients @xmath18 transform as @xmath39 where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation .",
    "for an intrinsically circular galaxy , or a galaxy ensemble whose unlensed coefficients @xmath40 obey equation  ( [ eq : f_unlensed ] ) , the lensed coefficients @xmath41 are left unchanged @xmath42 except for the @xmath43 modes , where @xmath44 with @xmath45 . after lensing , the galaxy has nonzero @xmath0 and @xmath43 coefficients ( but no others ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : mixing ] illustrates the action of mixing between nearby shapelet coefficients .",
    "the most obvious consequence is that the galaxy s unweighted ellipticity  ( [ eqn : unweightede ] ) also becomes non - zero .",
    "however , the fractional amount by which it changes depends upon the galaxy s radial profile .",
    "this idea will be explored in  [ shear_estimators ] , along with other combinations of combinations of @xmath1 coefficients .",
    "note that even a pure shear to first order can change the size of a galaxy , if it is not intrinsically circular . but propagating series  ( [ eqn : r2def ] ) through operation  ( [ eqn : opshear ] ) , and comparing the result to series  ( [ eqn : unweightede ] ) , it is easy to deduce that @xmath46 in fact , there are ( only ) two different linear combinations of shapelet coefficients that are invariant under a first order shear : @xmath47 furthermore , their sum is the total flux @xmath48 , whose measurement is also independent of the choice of scale size @xmath8 .",
    "if the shear field varies significantly across the width of an object , one side is distorted more than the other , and it becomes bent into an arclet .",
    "this effect has been dubbed `` flexion '' .",
    "building upon the work of goldberg & bacon ( 2005 ) , we shall now describe the distortions that arise from such gradients in the shear field , @xmath49 .",
    "the calculations will remain in the weak lensing regime , in the sense that no terms of order @xmath50 will be considered . however , flexion is most apparent along lines of sight close to foreground mass concentrations , where the shear is also likely to be strong .",
    "the more rapid falloff of a flexion signal as a function of distance from foreground mass can be used to probe smaller physical scales than a weak shear analysis , which produces relatively non - local mass reconstructions . bacon   ( 2006 ) demonstrate that it can be used to more precisely measure substructure of dark matter halos , and their inner profile or concentration .",
    "bacon  ( 2006 ) pointed out that the flexion signal can be split into two separate ( complex ) terms , the first and second flexions @xmath51 we assume that these have the same units as @xmath52 which , in the public code , is always expressed in terms of image pixels . via a derivation analogous to that in cartesian space by goldberg & bacon ( 2005 )",
    ", we can determine the action of the flexion operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 in polar shapelet space .",
    "these are much simpler than corresponding expressions in cartesian shapelet space , because distinct sets of coefficients are coupled in polar shapelet space by the two operations , and the flexion also fits naturally into our current complex notation . @xmath55 where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation .",
    "similarly , @xmath56 these operators are illustrated graphically in figure  ( [ fig : mixing ] ) .",
    "one crucial difference from the shear operator is that applying a flexion shifts the galaxy s observed centroid  ( [ eqn : xc ] ) by an amount @xmath57 in units of @xmath8 , with the real part corresponding to the @xmath33 direction and the imaginary part to the @xmath34 direction .",
    "the elements of expression  ( [ eqn : flexionshift ] ) are easily understood in terms of shapelet coefficients . a galaxy s centroid is constructed from its @xmath58 coefficients .",
    "these coefficients are altered during a first flexion @xmath53 if the galaxy has power in any @xmath0 or @xmath43 coefficients .",
    "the @xmath0 coefficients are never all zero , so the centroid will always shift .",
    "the centroid is altered during a second flexion @xmath54 if the galaxy has power in any @xmath43 coefficients , but the effects of its @xmath59 coefficients happen to cancel out in summation  ( [ eqn : xc ] ) .",
    "therefore an object s ellipticity uniquely determines this centroid shift .",
    "no comparable shift was introduced during shearing , so dealing with this will present a new technical challenge for weak lensing measurement .",
    "one mapping that will be required later is @xmath60 where @xmath61    operators  ( [ eqn : opfflex ] ) and ( [ eqn : opgflex ] ) are useful for applying an artificial flexion to an unlensed galaxy ( for example , during the manufacture of simulated images ) .",
    "however , for a practical , passive flexion measurement method , the natural location for the centre of a shapelet decompostion is the post - lensing ( observed ) centre of light @xmath62 , it being impossible to predict the pre - lensing sky position of the source .",
    "this point will be crucial in our later analysis because , for example , determinations of ellipticity and particularly flexion depend upon the origin of the coordinate system . to ensure that we account for this centroid shift ,",
    "we are greatly aided by the linear dependence of operator  ( [ eqn : flexionshift ] ) upon the coefficients that will make up our flexion estimators .",
    "the change in coordinate frame can be simultaneously corrected for by simply incorporating an appropriate translation in the operator used for flexion estimation @xmath63 where , from massey & refregier ( 2005 ) , the translation operator is @xmath64 these practical flexion operations for analysis of observed images effectively isolate the observable , shape - changing part of the flexion transformation by subtracting off the centroid shift .",
    "as described in goldberg & bacon ( 2005 ) , for the purposes of constructing workable flexion estimators the ellipticity @xmath65 can be estimated from the lensed galaxy image even though it will itself have changed during the lensing .",
    "the change in the centroid shift this represents is small , which can be seen from equation  ( [ eqn : flexionshift ] ) , and such changes will cancel on average due to the differing rotational symmetries of @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . if deemed necessary , an estimate of the ellipticity corrected for locally measured shear could even be used , as there is nothing to prevent the galaxy shear analysis from being independently performed prior to any flexion analysis .",
    "these operators will be used to form flexion estimators from observed galaxy shapes in  [ flexion_estimators ] .",
    "convergence changes a galaxy s size and brightness .",
    "actually measuring convergence is difficult because galaxies are intrinsically of very different sizes and magnitudes , and it is very hard to know what these quantities would have been before lensing , even statistically .",
    "( measurements of shear and flexion are made possible by the statistical assumption that an unlensed population of galaxies would be round . )",
    "however , it is important to take account of the effect of convergence on these measurements , which is given by @xmath69    increases in apparent galaxy size potentially cause ellipticities to be measured in different parts of a galaxy s profile  further towards the core or out in the wings .",
    "this is compensated for by the adaptative choice of the shapelet scale size @xmath8 during the shapelet decomposition described in massey & refregier ( 2005 ) .",
    "indeed , the operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 are commutative .",
    "changes in galaxy flux , or the averaging of shear estimators from bright and faint galaxies , can be controlled by constructing estimators that are invariant to object flux .",
    "this is trivially implemented for all of the estimators discussed in this paper by dividing by the flux . to first order in @xmath66 ,",
    "this quantity is invariant under a shear .",
    "it is also the most easily measured , zeroth - order aspect of morphology : very important since this appears on the denominator of shear estimators , where noise can translate into biases overall .",
    "note that this does not mean that the issues of `` reduced shear '' ( bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) or indeed `` reduced flexion '' (   okura , umetsu & futamase 2006 ) have been solved .",
    "pure gravitational shear or flexion are not observable in isolation .",
    "it is only possible to measure a degenerate combination of the shear or flexion with additional terms including the convergence .",
    "for the unweighted shear estimator @xmath72 , which is described in ",
    "[ sec : unweighted ] , the observable quantity is @xmath73 .",
    "however , as shown in appendix  [ reduced_shear ] , this represents a limiting case that no longer holds for arbitrary weighting schemes . for convenience ,",
    "the observable shear distortion will be labelled @xmath66 hereafter in this paper ; it should be understood that this really refers not to the gravitational shear but to the reduced shear @xmath74 corresponding to the estimator in question . in practice",
    "these reduced shears will be close to the @xmath75 for the limiting unweighted case , but in appendix  [ reduced_shear ] we discuss how shapelets might be used to calculate the generalized reduced shear for each shear estimation method .",
    "galaxy shapes also change during convolution with a telescope s point spread function . in shapelet space",
    ", convolution is another simple matrix operation ( refregier & bacon 2003 ) .",
    "deconvolution can be performed via a matrix inversion or simultaneously with shapelet decomposition via a method presented in ( massey & refregier 2005 ) .",
    "we shall not further discuss the challenge of deconvolution in this paper , leaving it as a separable , and essentially solved , problem .",
    "the main effect of deconvolution is to correlate shapelet coefficients ( since the basis functions no longer remain completely orthogonal after convolution ) .",
    "the full covariance matrix can easily be obtained during decomposition .",
    "it could , in principle , be used to perfect the weights on coefficients in the shear estimators , although we have derived results only in the limit where the covariance is nearly diagonal  which is approached by basis functions with oscillations larger than the psf size .",
    "to measure weak shear , we would like to construct some combination of each galaxy s observed shape components that is related to the shear field it has experienced .",
    "the combination can be of arbitrary complexity .",
    "for individual galaxies , the measured quantity will inevitably be noisy , because galaxies have their own intrinsic shapes , which are changed only very slightly by weak lensing .",
    "however , we shall aim to construct a shear estimator @xmath76 for which @xmath77 when averaged over a large galaxy ensemble in the absence of shear ; and , more importantly , @xmath78 individually . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : absenceoflensing ] , the first condition is easy to achieve by making sure that ( the numerator of ) @xmath76 contains only shapelet coefficients with @xmath79 .",
    "the second , calibration of the shear estimator , ensures that the estimator is always unbiased @xmath80 but this is notoriously difficult to satisfy (  bacon , 2001 ; erben , 2001 ; heymans , 2005 ; massey , 2007a ) .",
    "our effort will primarily be directed here .",
    "the easiest methodical approach towards a passive shear estimator is to first construct a `` polarisation '' estimator @xmath81 with the same rotational symmetries as shear .",
    "we then need to calculate its `` shear susceptibility '' @xmath82 so that @xmath83~.\\ ] ] the shear susceptibility can usefully be thought of as two complex numbers ; one for each component of shear .",
    "however , it is more commonly expressed as a real , @xmath84 tensor and , for the sake of familiarity , we shall adopt that notation here .",
    "its diagonal ( real ) terms describe the amount by which the polarisation will change under a shear .",
    "the off - diagonal ( imaginary ) terms describe a peculiar mixing by which a shear in one direction can affect the polarisation in a direction at @xmath85 .",
    "this is introduced by complex galaxy morphologies when a galaxy s isophotes are not concentric .",
    "we can then construct a shear estimator @xmath86 to make sure that indeed @xmath87 where the random intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies ensure that the first term vanishes , and thus condition  ( [ eqn : calibration2 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "however , we immediately encounter four difficulties with shear susceptibilities that account for most of the problems in the current generation of shear measurement methods :    * * @xmath88 is noisy . *",
    "it is usually constructed from an object s higher order shape moments , which are even harder to measure than the polarisation .",
    "since this appears on the denominator , it dramatically increases the scatter of the shear estimator : any ratio of quantities with gaussian errors produces the extended wings of a cauchy distribution ( as seen for a ksb analysis in figure  2 of massey  2004 ) , whose moments like @xmath89 do not even converge . *",
    "* @xmath88 is a tensor .",
    "* the matrix inversion in equation  ( [ eqn : pshovere ] ) is unstable , except for circularly symmetric galaxies , or an unlensed population ensemble , in which case the off - diagonal elements are always zero . in all other cases , shearing in one direction",
    "mixes ellipticity from all other directions , and this must be unmixed .",
    "* * @xmath88 is required pre - shear . *",
    "each galaxy is observable only after it has been lensed .",
    "unfortunately , the shear susceptibility factor may change during shear , to first order in @xmath66 for most galaxies , and to second order for even circularly - symmetric ones . *",
    "* the @xmath88 formalism ignores terms of second order in shear .",
    "* this omission may bias shear measurements at the sub - percent level of precision , and introduce non - linearities that depend upon an object s intrinsic ellipticity and @xmath59 shapelet coefficients .",
    "a frequently adopted solution to the first three difficulties is to average @xmath90 from a set of intrinsically similar galaxies , or to fit a value from a large galaxy ensemble as a function of other observables .",
    "this approach ought to find a suitable , statistical value for all galaxies .",
    "it diagonalises the shear susceptibility ; reduces noise ; and , if the population is so large that it contains effectively no coherent shear signal , satisfies the requirement for the pre - shear measurement .",
    "the fourth difficulty is particularly troublesome because an object s measured ellipticity is degenerate with the shear  but may also be resolvable in averages over a large population of galaxies chosen without shear - dependent biases .",
    "unfortunately , averaging over any large population of galaxies is inelegant , in the sense that shear estimators for individual galaxies are no longer self - contained .",
    "it also introduces new problems : the main issue being the practical identification of a set of intrinsically similar galaxies .",
    "most observable properties of a galaxy do change during a shear , and grouping galaxies by these leads to `` kaiser flow '' ( kaiser , 2000 ) .",
    "the common challenge facing all modern shear measurement methods is to either understand kaiser flow statistically , or to control shear susceptibility and thus avoid it . in appendix  [ kaiser_flow ] , we show how measurements with one polarisation estimator can be averaged to avoid kaiser flow , and maximise the weak lensing signal .    for the rest of this section , we shall construct progressively more elaborate polarisation estimators that ameliorate the four difficulties .",
    "we begin with simple polarisations that are compactly represented in polar shapelet space .",
    "these still suffer from all four difficulties .",
    "we then gradually exploit the symmetries of shapelets to add more complex features .",
    "the process is helped by the convenient shapelet notation , although the expressions do become more complicated . which of these advanced shear estimators is most appropriate to a given data set will depend on the desired application , the image quality ( for example , whether it was taken from the ground or in space ) , and the number of shapelet coefficients available for each galaxy .",
    "we shall start with the simplest possible combination of shapelet coefficients that can be used to build a polarisation estimator . recall that the first shapelet coefficients to be affected by a shear are those with @xmath43 . like shear , these rotate as @xmath91 , and they are therefore suitable for our purposes .",
    "the simplest possible polarisation estimator is simply the first shapelet coefficient with @xmath1 ,  @xmath92 .",
    "this has shear susceptibility @xmath93 in images from the hubble space telescope cosmos survey ( scoville , 2007 ) , for example , @xmath94 , which is not entirely negligible at the desired level of precision . by averaging the components of @xmath90 from a sufficiently large population of observed galaxies , or fitting them as a function of other observables like galaxy size and magnitude",
    ", we can explicitly force the mean @xmath95 coefficients to be zero , and ensure that the measured @xmath0 coefficients are statistically corrected before shear . with this simplification , the shear susceptibility factor",
    "can then be trivially inverted , and we arrive at the shear estimator @xmath96    this recovers the methods of rrg ( excluding the smear correction ) and refregier & bacon ( 2003 ) , casting them into the more succinct framework of polar shapelets .",
    "it recovers the @xmath97 component of ksb up to the normalisation of the polarisation estimator . to avoid biases and instability at low signal to noise",
    ", we have chosen to keep the polarisation and shear susceptibility linear in the image brightness .",
    "as a result however , both quantities vary widely in the full galaxy ensemble which typically encompass large ranges of flux and sizes , increasing the rate of kaiser flow . a similar decision ,  whether to normalise by flux or not , will also have to be made for all of the following shear estimators .",
    "a successful shapelet decomposition contains _ all _ of the available information about a galaxy s shape , and more information can be extracted than that available with previous shear estimators .",
    "since _ all _ of the @xmath43 shapelet basis functions have the same rotational symmetries , each of the corresponding shapelet coefficients can be used to form independent ( except for the covariance between shapelet coefficients after deconvolution ) polarisation estimators @xmath98 .",
    "these have shear susceptibilities @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 which reduce to @xmath102 when averaged over an ensemble of galaxies as before .",
    "thus , for each even order @xmath10 available in a shapelet decomposition , we can construct one independent , unbiased shear estimator @xmath103 as before , these estimators are by construction unbiased , when averaged over the galaxy population .",
    "one way to use these additional estimators is to diagnose problems in the measurement . because we obtain multiple shear measurements for each galaxy during a _ single _ psf deconvolution , their agreement provides a strong new test of systematics .",
    "if a pure shear signal is being successfully measured , all of the estimators from a given galaxy should average to the same value .",
    "however , if residual psf effects are polluting the signal , the separate estimators will disagree .",
    "a weak lensing pipeline must be highly robust to pass such stringent tests , and they will provide a unique discriminatory power in future analyses .    alternatively , the separate estimators can be linearly combined , with arbitrary weightings @xmath104 where the summation runs only over even indices @xmath10 , for only those coefficients exist . in this case",
    "@xmath105 the weights @xmath106 can be carefully constructed to optimise the signal - to - noise of the shear measurement ( such as inverse variance weighting , as suggested by refregier & bacon 2003 ) or to remove systematic biases plaguing the particular data set . for the rest of this section",
    ", we shall explore various options for this weight function . by staying linear in shapelet coefficients during this process",
    ", the polarisation and susceptibility also stay linear in the image , thus preserving a gaussian - like distribution of estimators . in real space , changing the weights @xmath106 is equivalent to changing the weight function used for the polarisation estimator .",
    "a galaxy s observed @xmath1 coefficients consist of intrinsic ellipticity , shear - induced ellipticity , and noise .",
    "for an individual galaxy , there is no way to tell what fraction of each is intrinsic , and what fraction is the signal .",
    "however , a shapelet decomposition contains a great deal more information about a galaxy s morphology that has not yet been tapped .",
    "in particular , it is the galaxy s intrinsic radial profile ( @xmath0 coefficients ) that contribute most to any change in observed ellipticity during a shear .",
    "since the @xmath0 coefficients are typically much larger than any others , they are also , fractionally , the least changed themselves under a small shear .",
    "we shall therefore approximate the unlensed radial profile as the observed , measured radial profile .",
    "we can then work out the `` radial profile '' of @xmath1 coefficients that could possibly have been induced by lensing .",
    "any component of the intrinsic ellipticity that does not have the appropriate `` radial profile '' can not possibly have been induced by lensing and , for our purposes , can be ignored .",
    "thus we reduce the contamination of intrinsic galaxy ellipticity in our shear estimators , to only include components of intrinsic ellipticity that happen to have the right profile .",
    "we determine the required weights @xmath106 by applying a unit shear to the rotationally - invariant part of a model , and find @xmath107 where one factor in the denominator comes from the shear susceptibility factor and one from the weighted average .",
    "of course , we have not taken measures to eliminate the @xmath59 and off - diagonal terms in the shear susceptibility factor .",
    "the shear susceptibility will therefore need to be fitted from a galaxy population as a function of size , magnitude and possibly radial profile .",
    "several shapelet - based parameters to span morphology variation are suggested in  7 of masssey & refregier ( 2005 ) .",
    "one of the difficulties with general shear estimators , as described at the start of  [ shear_estimators ] , is that they require the inversion of a ( noisy ) shear susceptibility tensor  ( [ eqn : weightedsusceptibility ] ) .",
    "this inversion is often unstable , and various implementations have chosen to either ignore the off - diagonal elements , or average over a large population of galaxies so that they disappear . the problem could be solved more easily if the shear susceptibility were explicitly a simple scalar ( times the identity matrix ) for each galaxy .",
    "indeed , it is possible to weight the various orders of @xmath108 in such a way that the off - diagonal terms in their combined susceptibility tensor from successive orders cancel each other .",
    "the off - diagonal terms , and the differences between the on - diagonal terms , involve @xmath59 coefficients that are introduced by the @xmath109 terms in equation  ( [ eqn : opshear ] ) . with",
    "these removed , the shear susceptibility  ( [ eqn : weightedsusceptibility ] ) will be diagonal and only involve terms with @xmath0",
    ". this can be trivially inverted .    a simple calculation to obtain the desired @xmath106 yields @xmath110 where the prefactor has been added to reproduce familiar quantities . in fact , @xmath111 , a version of the ( radially ) unweighted ellipticity without size ( or flux ) normalisation .",
    "this can not normally be calculated from images because background noise makes the real - space integrals diverge .",
    "a shapelet decomposition removes noise by acting as a prior on the permitted physical properties of a galaxy shape .",
    "this polarisation has shear susceptibility @xmath112 where the right hand side refers to quantities measured _ before _ shearing .",
    "the susceptibility is the size and magnitude of galaxies , in a curious contrast to the previous shear susceptibilities that needed to be ensemble averaged and fitted as a function of those observables .",
    "furthermore , as shown in equation  ( [ eqn : changeinr2 ] ) , to first order in @xmath66 , the size @xmath113 changes under a shear in a way that affects the overall shear estimator @xmath114 ensemble averaging , and expanding to first order in @xmath66 , we recover @xmath115 with the same `` shear responsivity '' factor of @xmath116 that appears in equation  ( [ eqn : oneminusesquared ] ) .",
    "thus we obtain an unbiased shear estimator @xmath117 that is written in terms of observable quantities alone , and requires minimal averaging of shapelet coefficients from a population of galaxies .",
    "this particular shear estimator emerged as one of the most successful shear measurement methods during blind tests as part of the step programme ( massey  2007a ) .",
    "this programme constructed simulated images that exhibit all the statistical properties of real astronomical images , but contain a known shear signal . while the measurement was performed ( by jb ) , these input shears were kept hidden . they were then revealed publicly after all the pipelines had been run .",
    "figure  [ fig : shearinout ] shows the impressive performance of our @xmath118 shear estimator for step2 image set a , which was specifically designed to mimic deep _",
    "suprime - cam _ images from the _ subaru _ telescope ( miyazaki , 2002 ) .",
    "a linear fit to these results shows a shear calibration factor ( multiplicative measurement bias ) of @xmath119 for the real component of shear , and @xmath120 for the imaginary component .",
    "there is no significant residual shear offset ( additive measurement bias ) , with the fitted values being @xmath121 for the real component of shear and @xmath122 for the imaginary component .",
    "this estimator demonstrated the best performance throughout the step2 project and , as suggested by that analysis , we shall reduce our error bars before the next round by incorporating a galaxy weighting scheme into our weak lensing pipeline .",
    "one additional benefit of this estimator is that both the polarisation and the shear susceptibility are independent of the shapelet scale scale @xmath8 .",
    "although the ensemble average of any shear estimators @xmath123 should always be independent of @xmath8 , in general , individual estimators @xmath124 may not be .",
    "but in the current case , once a shapelet series has converged , @xmath48 , @xmath113 and @xmath65 combine coefficients in such as way as to not depend upon the choice of @xmath8 ( massey & refregier , 2005 ) .",
    "this result is non - trivial : in our image decomposition pipeline , we choose @xmath8 to optimise the image reconstruction and stabilise the psf deconvolution .",
    "however , this is only one possible goal . in imcat implementations of the ksb method ,",
    "the equivalent of @xmath8 is instead chosen to maximise the signal - to - noise for detection of the object . in sextractor implementations of ksb",
    ", a scaling of sextractor parameters is used . in all cases ,",
    "the choice of @xmath8 will also be affected by any applied shear that changes a galaxy s apparent size . whether this change is negligible depends on the specific implementation of the algorithm to determine @xmath8 and",
    "must be tested experimentally . in this case , it is reassuring to note that this effect is formally absent , modulo the convergence of the series .",
    "since the step tests , we have also derived the full `` kaiser flow '' behaviour of this estimator .",
    "this has a particularly interesting form , and is discussed fully in appendix  [ kaiser_flow ] .",
    "the shear susceptibility can be further simplified , by continuing to add terms to the polarisation estimator .",
    "so far , we have used the @xmath43 coefficients , but no others .",
    "in fact , all shapelet basis functions with @xmath125 contain the rotational symmetries of shear ; the higher order functions just contain additional symmetries as well .",
    "they can not be used as shear estimators by themselves but , because of this , it is possible to add them to the @xmath43 coefficients .",
    "the resulting polarisation estimator will stay linear in shapelet coefficients , linear in image flux , and keep all of the desired symmetries .",
    "here we shall demonstrate how higher order shapelet coefficients can be used to `` sweep '' terms in the shear susceptibility down to @xmath0 , and construct a polarisation @xmath126 with any desired susceptibility factor .",
    "we begin with the @xmath127 polar shapelet coefficient . as shown in ",
    "[ sec : ksb ] , this has a shear susceptibility involving @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the weight on the @xmath127 coefficient in @xmath131 can be used to create any desired factor in front of the @xmath128 term in @xmath90 . in  [ sec : unweighted ] , we added coefficient @xmath132 in such a way to cancel out the @xmath130 coefficient in the shear susceptibility . instead , we shall now add an amount of @xmath132 ( then @xmath133 , @xmath134 , ) to shape the susceptibility s @xmath129 ( and @xmath135 , @xmath136 ) terms in any way . assuming extrapolation to infinite @xmath10 , we can thus construct a polarisation estimator with arbitrary @xmath0 terms in its shear susceptibility tensor .",
    "however , it will also contain non - zero @xmath59 terms and off - diagonal elements .",
    "now consider the @xmath137 polar shapelet coefficient .",
    "this has a shear susceptibility involving @xmath130 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 coefficients .",
    "this can be added to the polarisation with a weight arranged so that the three @xmath130 terms in the shear susceptibility now cancel out .",
    "the @xmath140 coefficient can then be added so that the four @xmath138 terms cancel , and so on .",
    "this leaves ` dangling ' terms in the shear susceptibility with @xmath141 ( and due to series truncation , in practice , high @xmath10 ) .",
    "successive additions of @xmath142 terms to the polarisation can push these terms to higher and higher @xmath17 . since the magnitude of shapelet coefficients for real galaxies typically fall off rapidly with @xmath10 and @xmath17 , the contribution of any remaining dangling terms due to series truncation decreases during this process .    a second , interwoven combination of shapelet coefficients starting with @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145",
    "can also be constructed , to make a completely separate polarisation whose shear susceptibility involves arbitrary contributions of only @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 coefficients .",
    ".coefficient weights for the real part of the @xmath149 shear estimator ( equation  [ eqn : shinv ] ) .",
    "the imaginary part of this shear estimator involves complex conjugates of terms with every other value of @xmath11 , but is most conveniently found by instead rotating the galaxies by @xmath85 then calculating the real part a second time . [ cols=\">,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : shearinvariant ]    we are now free to decide the most suitable form for the shear susceptibility , and can construct any appropriate polarisation estimator .",
    "it would be easiest to satisfy requirement  ( [ eqn : calibration ] ) if @xmath90 did not change under shear .",
    "we could then use the observed ( post - shear ) value for each individual galaxy .",
    "the only two quantities  ( [ shapelets : eq : shearinvariant1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : shearinvariantquantities ] ) like this can clearly be constructed from these two interwoven combinations of shapelet coefficients .",
    "we shall construct the polarisation estimator with shear susceptibility @xmath150 , where @xmath48 is the flux .",
    "clearly , any shear estimator must eventually be normalised so that the same shape is calculated for two ( otherwise identical ) galaxies of different brightnesses .",
    "the flux is the simplest , and most robustly measured normalisation , and the obvious choice to put on the denominator ; @xmath151    calculating @xmath152 for this case is an elementary but tedious procedure using the iterative method described above .",
    "the first terms are listed in table  [ tab : shearinvariant ] .",
    "note that although each term in the series is well - defined , a real - space calculation in appendix  [ most_linear ] demonstrates that the summation approaches a solution that is not continuously differentiable .",
    "unweighted ellipticities ( and higher - order properties ) can not usually be measured from real images , due to the presence of noise that makes the integrals diverge . however ,",
    "this becomes possible with shapelets ( or im2shape or galfit ) because a noise - free ( and unpixellated and deconvolved ) model of the galaxy is reconstructed .",
    "for different weight functions , the question becomes one of the convergence of galaxies radial profiles to zero at large radii , and the suitable truncation of its measured shapelet series .",
    "a galaxy with an exponential profile has polar shapelet coefficients @xmath153 for a well chosen @xmath8 : for a sufficiently high @xmath154 , all of the shear estimators do converge .",
    "for a further discussion of the convergence of shapelet series , see massey & refregier ( 2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , although polar shapelet coefficients can be measured to infinite @xmath10 using the linear overlap method ( see massey & refregier 2005 ) for idealised data , this is not the case using the now standard @xmath155 fitting method ( see also kuijken 2006 ; nakajima & bernstein 2006 ) , or in the presence of pixellisation or a psf ( berry , hobson & withington 2004 ) .",
    "we therefore need to ensure that sufficient coefficients can be measured , particularly for the elaborate polarisation estimators that converge more slowly .",
    "they may therefore require galaxies of slightly higher signal to noise and @xmath154 .",
    "this can be achieved by raising the magnitude or size cut in a lensing catalogue , although the extent to which this is necessary has to be determined by experiment .",
    "however , the more elaborate polarisation estimators have correspondingly simpler shear susceptibilities , which converge faster . as was the case for noise",
    ", the minimisation of truncation errors is particularly important in the denominator , and this may in fact prove to be the deciding factor .",
    "bernstein & jarvis ( 2002 ) , kuijken ( 2006 ) and nakajima & bernstein ( 2006 ) suggest a rather different philosophy for constructing shear estimators . instead of measuring an observed polarisation , and calculating how that would have changed during shear , bernstein & jarvis ( 2002 ) shear objects ( or their coordinate system ) until they appear circular .",
    "kuijken ( 2006 ) assumes that objects were intrinsically circular (  models with @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath79 ) , then shears them until they most closely resemble the data .",
    "this makes for a simpler calculation because the shape of each object , including its higher order moments , is known well _ before _ the operation .",
    "forward shearing of an image is also useful , because it can be performed to arbitrarily high order in @xmath66 , addressing the fourth concern in  [ shear_estimators ] . in real space",
    ", the sheared ellipticity of the shapelet basis functions in bernstein & jarvis ( 2002 ) can be chosen from a continuous range ; in shapelet space , operation  ( [ eqn : opshear ] ) can be exponentiated to include higher order terms .",
    "however , a shear susceptibility factor is still needed ( the calibration factor @xmath158 in equation  ( 5.33 ) of bernstein & jarvis ( 2002 ) has the same origin as that in our equation  ( [ eqn : unweightedshearest ] ) ) .",
    "this too must be fitted or interpolated from a galaxy population as a function of other observables , so offers no advantage over a shear susceptibility .    at first sight",
    ", this shear measurement philosphy seems more efficient than the passive , moment - based shear estimators considered in the rest of this paper .",
    "active methods do not require the full model of each deconvolved galaxy shape , but extract only the required quantity @xmath66 .",
    "however , the decadence of obtaining a full shape reconstruction can provide extra information that is invaluable . for example , checking that the model s residual image is consistent with noise can indicate potential problems , and which shear estimates to trust , in a way that is not possible if ony a single number is obtained for each galaxy . in principle , it is possible to expand the definition of `` circularity '' in bernstein & jarvis ( 2002 ) to involve different shapelet coefficients , but this does not generate extra information that is necessarily useful for systematic cross - checks . in that case , each fit would require a separate non - linear iteration to find the best - fitting parameters @xmath62 , @xmath8 , @xmath154 and @xmath66 , and therefore could be subject to independent biases . since altering the shear estimator could change any systematic influences in this method , it would be difficult to interpret any variation between the estimators . instead fitting a model that is simultaneously capable of capturing all the shape information",
    "also makes the psf deconvolution more robust and intuitive than methods that use a model representing only the best - fit elliptical profile of a complex galaxy shape .",
    "in our experiments with elliptical shapelet basis functions , we have confirmed that the choice of that ellipticity is the most unstable part of the iteration , particularly for objects at low signal to noise .",
    "we have had one idea for a different truncation scheme with highly elliptical basis sets .",
    "a problem arises when fluctuations along the minor axis become smaller than the psf or a pixel and therefore non - orthogonal .",
    "simply decreasing @xmath154 ( nakajima & bernstein 2006 ) also shortens the reach of the basis funtions along the major axis , and therefore could potentially bias a shear measurement .",
    "however , it is possible to first rotate the basis functions so that @xmath159 lies along the major axis of the ellipse , then truncate the basis functions at different values of @xmath160 and @xmath161 , the cartesian shapelet indices in the @xmath162 and @xmath163directions .",
    "if the newly - truncated coefficients are kept , but initially set to zero , operation  ( 37 ) from massey & refregier ( 2005 ) can be used to recover the coefficients that would have been obtained from an unrotated set of elliptical basis functions and thus continue the bernstein & jarvis ( 2002 ) method .",
    "we shall now try to develop estimators for the weak lensing flexion , making use of our experience with the shear estimators , and drawing tight analogies .",
    "the simplest passive simple flexion estimator can be formed from a similar approach to that taken when constructing our ksb - like shear estimator @xmath164 .",
    "for that , we considered the gaussian weighted quadrupole moments , which were the first perturbed under a shear . in this case , the shapelet coefficients primarily affected by first and second flexions , transform as @xmath165 @xmath166    therefore , the combinations @xmath167 and @xmath168 can be used as simple flexion estimators .    note that the @xmath65s in equations  ( [ eqn : ffirstorder ] ) and ( [ eqn : gfirstorder ] ) refer to the pre - lensing ellipticity , and really do cancel out when averaging over a population of galaxies , even in the presence of a shear field .",
    "changes in @xmath113 due to flexion do not bias @xmath169 to first order either , as these cancel when averaged over a population of galaxies .",
    "for the small and faint galaxies that make up the majority of a weak lensing survey , it will be difficult to measure polar shapelet coefficients beyond the @xmath170 terms needed to estimate @xmath171 as described above .",
    "however , for those galaxies whose higher order shapes can be measured , it is possible to generalise the flexion estimators .    the terms in curly brackets in equations  ( [ eqn : ffirstorder ] ) and ( [ eqn : gfirstorder ] ) effectively describe a flexion susceptibility factor , which we introduce by analogy with the shear susceptibility factor  ( [ eqn : shearpolarisation ] )",

    "we search for sophisticated combinations that produce flexion estimators with useful properties , analogous to those already created for shear estimators .",

    "it might also be hoped that successive off - diagonal terms in the flexion susceptibility matrices could be made to cancel via a suitable weighting scheme @xmath106 , as was possible for shear in  [ sec : unweighted ] .",
    "unfortunately , due to the presence of the centroid - shifting correction so necessary for reliable flexion estimators , this is difficult ; especially for the first flexion .    for the second flexion we can come tantalisingly close , and indeed",
    "if we only consider the _ pure _ @xmath184 transformation of equation ( [ eqn : opgflex ] ) , the weighting scheme @xmath185 can be used to form a second flexion estimator @xmath186 this is none other than the quantity @xmath187 , as developed for holics by okura , umetsu  & futamase ( 2006 ) , except for the additional `` flexion responsivity '' factor @xmath158 .",
    "this arises because the denominator changes during flexion ( see equation  [ eqn : changeinxi ] ) , biasing the overall estimator by an amount @xmath188 in a completely analogous fashion to the shear responsivity factor calculated in  [ sec : unweighted ] . also , the inclusion of terms from the flexion - induced centroid shift ( [ eqn : pracflex ] ) results in off - diagonal elements in @xmath189 that can not all be removed through any combination of the @xmath28 coefficients .    in the case of the first flexion ,",
    "the prospects are worse : even if we could omit the @xmath190 part of a practical flexion operator ( which , for @xmath67 we most certainly can not ) , a @xmath106 capable of cancelling the off - diagonal terms in the susceptibility matrix has yet to be found by the authors .",
    "the complication arises from the mixing of power between @xmath191 coefficients in the first flexion operation  ( [ eqn : opfflex ] ) . like a centroid shift",
    ", flexion causes power to leak between adjacent shapelet coefficients (   figure  [ fig : mixing ] ) .",
    "however , whereas the centroid shift involves only the single ladder - operator transformations @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 ( see refregier 2003 ) , flexion always acts via combinations of three of these ladder operations , taking three steps but doubling back to move only one overall . since @xmath192 does not commute with @xmath194 , nor @xmath193 with @xmath195 ,",
    "each @xmath196 term in equation  ( [ eqn : opfflex ] ) is in fact a combination of five separate contributions , each of which representing a different , independent path between the coefficients .",
    "worst of all , each path contributes a differing , @xmath10-dependant proportion of the overall transformation .",
    "this added level of complexity for the first flexion transformation therefore precludes any estimator of first flexion with vanishing off - diagonal terms in the susceptibility matrix .",
    "the @xmath8-invariant quantity obtained by setting @xmath197 and @xmath58 in equations  ( 56 ) and ( 58 ) of massey & refregier ( 2005 ) could be used to measure first flexion .",
    "unfortunately , this quantity does not appear to have any other properties that are particularly interesting in the context of weak lensing .      in a similar way to the active shear estimators , it is also convenient to use a shapelet representation when distorting a circular object ( or possibly an object with both circular @xmath0 and elliptical @xmath43 components ) by applying flexion until it matches the observed shape .",
    "goldberg & bacon ( 2005 ) suggested a prescription in cartesian shapelets , which has been implemented by goldberg & leonard ( 2007 ) , to fit the odd shapelet coefficients by perturbing the even ones .",
    "this results in a simple , @xmath155 minimisation via matrix inversion .",
    "however , their approach is not perfectly clean . the even cartesian shapelet coefficients mix a great deal of structure beyond the circularly symmetric and elliptical components .",

    "since the flexion signal is spread evenly across fewer polar shapelet coefficients than cartesian ones , but noise from an uncorrelated sky background is equal in all shapelet coefficients , using fewer coefficients will result in a cleaner fit , with improved signal to noise .",
    "we have described the mechanics of weak gravitational lensing in terms of `` polar shapelets '' ( refregier 2003 ; massey & refregier 2005 ) .",

    "the symmetries of polar shapelets are well - matched to those of lensing . for example , the complex notation of polar shapelet coefficients , where their modulus represents the amount of power , and their phase represents their orientation , mirrors that commonly used in the literature to define a complex ellipticity .",
    "in addition , polar shapelets concisely encapsulate the ideas of weak flexion that have been recently developed .",
    "the symmetries inherent to the polar shapelet formalism provide useful insight into the parallel symmetries of weak lensing distortions .",
    "we have exploited this relation to construct estimators that are able to simultaneously extract both the weak shear and flexion signal from the observed shapes of distant galaxies .",
    "we attempt to bypass some of the limitations of ksb and other shear measurement methods that were reviewed in step2 . adopting the classification scheme from that programme",
    ", we briefly discussed the recasting of alternative , `` active '' shear and flexion estimators into the polar shapelet formalism , and more comprehensively explored the options available for `` passive '' shear and flexion estimators .",
    "the gaussian - weighted shear estimator @xmath198 recovers old methods like ksb and rrg , but in a compact complex notation .",
    "the unweighted shear estimator @xmath199 takes advantage of the noise - free shapelet reconstructions to diagonalise the shear susceptibility tensor into a scalar quantity .",
    "this particular quantity happens to be easily derivable in real space as well .",
    "the simplification of the shear susceptibility is completed with @xmath200 . with this , the shear susceptibility is simply the object s flux : a robustly measured quantity , and one that does not change to first order during shear .",
    "the growing complexity of these shear estimators solves progressively more of the four issues highlighted with previous - generation shear measurement methods .",
    "however , they also converge more slowly , and require high-@xmath10 coefficients to be available .",
    "the later estimators may consequently be accessible only on galaxy images with higher signal - to - noise .",
    "the best estimator to use ( which may not even be the same for an entire population ) may therefore depend on the flux of an object , or the nature of residual problems found in any particular dataset .",
    "one final , particularly interesting alternative option is the estimator @xmath201 that can reduce the rms shear noise due to intrinsic galaxy ellipticities , by exploting additional information about each galaxy s radial profile .",
    "analogous estimators for flexion also exist for most of these options .",
    "interestingly , our method permits several independent shear estimators and several flexion estimators to be obtained simultaneously for each galaxy .",
    "because we calculate them following a _ single _ psf deconvolution or non - linear iteration , their agreement ( or otherwise ) will provide a stringent new test on the psf modelling and for other residual systematic effects .",
    "such tests are unique to our approach , as the interpretation of analogous active shear estimators would be hindered by the need to perform a separate psf deconvolution for each estimator , and possibly removing any shared defects .",
    "we have demonstrated the performance of one of our key shear estimators via blind tests that were part of the shear testing programme ( step ; massey , 2007a ) .",
    "we shall compare the practical performance of our remaining shear estimators in a future round of step simulations .",
    "we are also implementing an option to input a known flexion signal in the image simulation suite of massey  ( 2004 ) .",
    "we are planning a smaller - scale , flexion version of step , to calibrate the performance of emerging weak flexion estimators , including the ones presented in this work as well as others presented elsewhere . in the mean time , a complete idl software package capable of performing the shapelet image decomposition , including the weak lensing manipulation and analysis described in this paper , is available from the shapelets web site http://www.astro.caltech.edu/@xmath202rjm/shapelets .",

    "for the purposes of the following discussion we here reproduce much of the work of schneider & seitz ( 1995 ) .",
    "we use @xmath203 and elsewhere the suffix @xmath204 to denote coordinates and quantities in the galaxy source plane , and @xmath205 and no suffix to denote coordinates and quanitities in the lensed image plane .",
    "let @xmath206 be the surface brightness distribution of the source and let @xmath207 be some weighting function of the surface brightness . for the case of no weighting , @xmath208 .",
    "we define the centre of the source by @xmath209 and the quadropole matrix of the source by @xmath210 where @xmath211 . to describe the shape ( including orientation ) of a source , we define the complex ellipticity , @xmath212    the gravitational imaging of a general source is described by the lens equation @xmath213 where the mass distribution is smooth on scales of galaxy images , the imaging of the source can be approximated by the locally linearized lens mapping @xmath214 where @xmath215 the jacobian of the lens equation",
    ".    now , we can also define analagous second moments @xmath216 for the _ lensed image _ of a source @xmath217 using , and the fact that image surface brightness is conserved under gravitational light deflection so that @xmath218 using the linearized mapping we may write @xmath219 , giving the result @xmath220  that @xmath216 transforms as a tensor for a locally linearized mapping .",
    "the applicability of this desirable result rests heavily on the condition .",
    "we may write the jacobian as @xmath221 where we have defined the _ reduced shear _ @xmath222 .",
    "the transformation between @xmath65 and @xmath223 can then be written as @xmath224 we see immediately that the transformation between the source and image ellipticities @xmath223 and @xmath65 depends solely on the combination @xmath74 .    incidentally , we can continue this calculation one more step and obtain , to first order in @xmath74 , @xmath225 which , averaging over a population ensemble , is @xmath226      we noted above that the tensor transformation of @xmath216 relies on the invariance under lensing transformation of the weighted surface brightness distribution , a condition that is only satisfied for an isophotal weighting function @xmath227 .",
    "this schema carries practical difficulties for noisy images , and in general we wish to weight objects by multiplying their image by a fixed function @xmath228 , such that @xmath229 it is from weighted moments such as these that weak lensing shear is generally measured , and such moments ( with gaussian @xmath230 functions ) are directly equivalent to combinations of the @xmath231 and @xmath232 polar shapelet coefficients .    however , we see instantly that the combination @xmath233 _ is no longer invariant under the lensing transformation _ : @xmath234 in general .",
    "this prevents us from writing the transformation between @xmath216 and @xmath235 in the simple form of .",
    "the quadrupole moments no longer transform as tensors and we must instead write @xmath236 where each element of @xmath237 depends upon @xmath32 , @xmath35 , @xmath238 , and the functional forms of @xmath239 and @xmath230 . importantly , because each element of @xmath237 will vary with each of these quantities , we can not therefore assume that the transformation between @xmath223 and @xmath65 will depend solely on the combination @xmath74 for an arbitrary weighting function .    the differences between and",
    "are generally assumed to be small for practical weak lensing purposes .",
    "shapelet space is convenient for the calculation of elements of @xmath237 . for a given weighting function",
    ", the transformation may be written approximately as a power series in @xmath32 , @xmath35 , @xmath238 , and the image moments / shapelet coefficients @xmath18 . in this way , shapelets provides one method for estimating the _ generalized _ reduced shear for each galaxy image , a complicated function of @xmath32 , @xmath35 , @xmath238 , @xmath18 and @xmath230 in each case .",
    "in  [ sec : unweighted ] , we obtained expressions for unweighted , unnormalised second moments for each galaxy .",
    "we constructed an unnormalised size measure @xmath240 and two unnormalised polarisation components @xmath241 and @xmath242 , all of which have strong flux dependencies .",
    "we must now find an estimator for the local shear on an image given these polarisations .",
    "if we were interested in a shear estimate for a single galaxy , we might argue that since the lensed quantities we measure are related to unlensed quantities by @xmath243 @xmath244 with @xmath245 , we could use an estimator for the shear @xmath246 however , when we come to combining shear estimators from galaxies with different flux and size properties , this approach is not adequate .",
    "firstly , it does not give a prescription for how to optimally combine the estimates from galaxies with very different flux and shape properties .",
    "furthermore , it ignores the fact that , under shear , some galaxies will flow out of a cell containing galaxies at a given flux , @xmath247 and ellipticity , while other galaxies will flow in - and these flows may not cancel ; a weighting scheme should take account of this .    in seeking to address these issues",
    ", we closely follow the approach offered by kaiser ( 2000 ; section 3.2 ) , although the fact that we are dealing with unweighted moments simplifies our analysis .",
    "we wish to obtain an estimator for the shear that takes into account the shear - induced flow of galaxies in the parameter space @xmath248 , where @xmath48 is the flux and @xmath249 is an invariant measure of the ellipticity amplitude of an object",
    ". we will find it convenient to describe @xmath250 , with the unit polarisation vector given by @xmath251 ,  @xmath252 gives the position angle of the galaxy .",
    "in this case , we can describe a volume element for polarisation by @xmath253 , or @xmath254 .",
    "let us consider the distribution of galaxies in this parameter space .",
    "we will represent sheared distributions as primed quantities .",
    "if the number density in this parameter space is @xmath10 , then we can describe the conservation of galaxies under shear by @xmath255 note that this differs from kaiser s ( 2000 ) analysis in not requiring integration over distinct polarisabilities , as these polarisabilities are themselves given by @xmath247 and @xmath256 in our case , due to using unweighted moments .",
    "we now multiply both sides of this equation by @xmath257 , where @xmath230 is an arbitrary function , and integrate over all variables .",
    "this will ultimately allow us to obtain a relation between the average polarisation , the distribution of galaxies , and the shear .",
    "initially we find @xmath258 this can be simplified by noting that , because of the isotropy of the unsheared population , @xmath259 making a taylor expansion of the left hand side of equation  ( [ eqn : appaeq5 ] ) , we obtain @xmath260    if we note from equations ( [ qshr1 ] ) and ( [ qshr2 ] ) that @xmath261 , @xmath262 , and @xmath263 , we can integrate the above expression by parts to obtain @xmath264 since @xmath265 to first order in the shear , we can omit it on both sides ( we are free to do this as it is arbitrary ) , to obtain a relation between the mean of the sheared galaxies polarisations , and the galaxy distribution function , sizes , and shapes @xmath266    we can usefully write this in terms of an average only over position angles of galaxies .",
    "if we move to writing expressions in terms of the density @xmath267 and note that the average over position angles @xmath268 , then we can write the average of @xmath256 over position angle only ( i.e. at fixed @xmath269 ) as @xmath270 ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is @xmath271 rather than @xmath272",
    ". it will be useful to introduce the susceptibility @xmath273 , where @xmath274 with @xmath275    we have therefore obtained the appropriate polarisation to use as a function of flux , size and shape for an ensemble of galaxies .",
    "hence we can construct a shear estimator for galaxies in a particular small cell in @xmath276 space @xmath277 where @xmath278 is the number of galaxies in the cell in question .",
    "however , we would like an estimator which did not require the splitting of galaxies into cells in parameter space , and which optimally combines the estimators from different galaxies . we discuss this problem in the next section .      here",
    "we will discuss the optimal weighting of shear estimators for a spatial cell - average shear .",
    "again , we are following the work of kaiser ( 2000 ) .    for our parameter - space cell shear",
    "estimate given in equation ( [ cellest ] ) above , we can find the estimator variance @xmath279 where the final equality assumes that galaxy polarisations are essentially uncorrelated in the weak shear regime .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath280    since parameter - space cells provide shear estimates which are uncorrelated from cell to cell , the optimal weighting @xmath281 is proportional to @xmath282 , as then the overall estimator variance will be minimised .",
    "so the final total shear estimate for a small spatial aread will be given by @xmath283 where @xmath284 .",
    "the simplest polarisation estimator can be constructed for a galaxy image @xmath285 as @xmath286 where the flux @xmath287 .",
    "the diagonal components of the shear susceptibility tensor for this estimator take the simple form @xmath288 ( evaluated without the weight ) , and we recover the shear estimator @xmath289 from  [ shinv ] .",
    "the @xmath48 factor could also have been incorporated directly into the shear susceptibility factor ; then both terms are formally linear , and it is only at the point of forming a shear estimator that any ratios need to be taken .    if we ignore the correction for psf convolution , the ksb method can also be recast in these simple terms .",
    "this requires gaussian - weighted quadrupole ellipticities @xmath290 where @xmath291 and @xmath292 is the scale size of a gaussian weight function .",
    "this is introduced to make sure the integrals converge in a noisy image , and to eliminate the effects of neighbouring objects .",
    "unfortunately , this weight function complicates the correction for the psf , and makes the corresponding @xmath293 tensor messy ( see equations  ( 5 - 2 ) to ( 5 - 4 ) in ksb ) .",
    "introducing a ratio of moments at this early stage reduces the dynamic range of the ellipticities and the shear susceptibility , but also exacerbates the noise .",
    "ksb also derive a correction for the effects of psf convolution on a galaxy s shape , with this gaussian and assumptions about the form of the psf built - in .",
    "we can generalise this procedure by defining two arbitrary weight functions @xmath294 , with @xmath295 , that can be used to define two linear polarisations @xmath296 the coordinate system is then distorted by a shear @xmath297 and our shape estimators for the observed image become @xmath298 ~{\\mathrm d}x{\\mathrm d}y ~. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrating each term by parts , and including a boundary condition on the rapid convergence of the image to zero at large radii , we obtain @xmath299 i(x , y ) ~{\\mathrm d}x{\\mathrm d}y ~~ \\\\    + ~",
    "\\gamma_2 \\iint \\left[x\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial y } + y\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial x}\\right ] i(x , y ) ~{\\mathrm d}x{\\mathrm d}y ~. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this pair of integrals , for each of the two weight functions , make up the four coefficients in the shear susceptibility tensor .",
    "this procedure can also be followed in polar coordinates , where we find @xmath300 i(r,\\theta ) ~r{\\mathrm d}r{\\mathrm d}\\theta ~~ \\nonumber \\\\    + ~ \\gamma_2 \\iint \\left[r\\sin{2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial r }   + \\cos{2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial \\theta}\\right ] i(r,\\theta ) ~r{\\mathrm d}r{\\mathrm d}\\theta ~. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      as was the case in section  [ ksb ] , it is always impossible to form a completely linear shear estimator , since bright galaxies would then yield larger shear estimators than faint ones ; it will always be necessary to normalise a shear estimator by something proportional to the object s flux .",
    "however , we can construct one ellipticity for which the shear susceptibility tensor is diagonal and whose diagonal coefficients are _ exactly equal to _ that flux ( this is equivalent to including a factor of @xmath301 in an ellipticity estimator that has @xmath302 ) .",
    "this will solve all three problems raised at the beginning of  [ shear_estimators ] , because the flux is the most easily measured quantity of an object , the matrix inversion can be replaced by a division , and the flux is not changed under a shear ( nor will the overall shear estimator be changed by lensing magnification ) .    to achieve this shear estimator with the desired integrals from equation  ( [ eqn : pgamma ] ) , we require @xmath303 so that @xmath304 or in polar coordinates @xmath305 these equations are inconsistent .",
    "therefore no continuous , analytic function exists with all the properties desired for a fully linear shear estimator .",
    "however , a series approximation that tends to these requirements is given by the expansion in  [ shinv ] ."
