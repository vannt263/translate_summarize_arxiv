    "scanning force microscopy ( sfm ) @xcite has provided interesting information @xcite about the position dependence of hall potential and current density in narrow hall bars , with a width of about @xmath0 m . under strong perpendicular magnetic fields @xmath1 , which allow the observation of the integer quantized hall effect ( qhe ) @xcite , three types of the spatial variation of the hall potential were observed . for @xmath1 values",
    "well outside the plateaus of the qhe , the hall potential varied essentially linearly across the sample ( `` type i '' ) , as one expects from the classical drude theory of the hall effect . as the @xmath1 field entered a plateau region from the high - field side , a non - linear potential drop in a broad region in the middle of the sample",
    "was observed ( `` type ii '' ) .",
    "most interestingly , near the low-@xmath1 edges of the qh plateaus the hall potential was constant in a broad region in the center of the sample and dropped across two strips that moved with decreasing @xmath1 towards the sample edges ( `` type iii '' ) @xcite .",
    "position and width of these strips coincided with those of the incompressible strips ( iss ) expected to form in the sample due to the non - linear screening properties of the two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) in strong magnetic fields @xcite . in the `` perfect screening '' limit @xcite of vanishing temperature and collision broadening , the potential varies only in these iss , where the local filling factor is an integer and the electron density is constant , and in between the iss the potential is flat .",
    "these experimental results have been qualitatively reproduced by a self - consistent calculation @xcite of the screened confinement potential @xmath2 and the electron and current densities under the assumption , that the imposed , and in general dissipative , current density @xmath3 obeys a local form of ohm s law , @xmath4 , with the gradient of the electrochemical potential @xmath5 as driving electric field , @xmath6 .",
    "the position - dependent conductivity tensor @xmath7 , determining longitudinal and hall current , was , in turn , calculated from @xmath2 and @xmath5 under the assumption of _ local thermodynamic equilibrium _ @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these self - consistent calculations showed an unexpected non - linear feedback effect of the imposed current on the electron density : the calculated iss near the sample edges , and as a consequence the current distribution among and the drop of the hall potential across these strips , became with increasing strength of the imposed current increasingly asymmetric .",
    "however , since this asymmetry , which vanishes in the linear - response limit of low imposed current @xcite , was not clearly seen in the experiments , it was not investigated in detail .    in a recent series of similar experiments ,",
    "sfm was applied to investigate the breakdown of the qhe in narrow hall bars under strong imposed currents @xcite .",
    "unidirectional current pulses were used , to avoid averaging out of effects depending on the direction of the imposed current .",

    "these non - linear transport effects are most important near the low-@xmath1 edges of the qh plateaus .",
    "also the smoothing of the conductivity tensor is most effective near these edges .",
    "this smoothing has a strong effect on narrow iss , where it removes the zeroes of @xmath147 , but only a weak effect on wide iss , where it mainly modifies the behavior near the edges .",
    "thus it enhances the current - induced asymmetry , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : z0 - 3b720 ] . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the linear - response limit of weak imposed current , replacing of @xmath112 by its average @xmath198 over an interval of length @xmath164 reduces the width of the qh plateaus , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rlhvsb ] .",
    "taking the averages with sufficiently large @xmath155 , makes the iss with @xmath146 ineffective already at higher @xmath1-fields , for which no iss with @xmath156 exist in the sample .",
    "then the imposed current is spread out to the compressible region and suffers dissipation .",
    "consequently , the qh plateau with @xmath134 shrinks at its low-@xmath1 side , where @xmath199 decreases and @xmath160 becomes finite .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rlhvsb ] for @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "we see that for finite imposed current the effects of @xmath155 , of the collision broadening described by @xmath48 , and of temperature are qualitatively similar as in the linear response regime @xmath202 .",
    "in addition fig .",
    "[ fig : rlhvsb ] shows that the current - induced asymmetry of the iss , resulting in a broadening of one is , tends to broaden the qh plateaus at their low-@xmath1 edge and , consequently , to lower @xmath160 .",
    "the high-@xmath1 edge of the @xmath134 qh plateau seems rather insensitive to changes of all these parameters except @xmath48 : if the collision broadening is reduced , @xmath160 becomes smaller .",
    "nevertheless , as fig .",
    "[ fig : jyuh - b735 ] shows , the imposed current induces an asymmetry and a broadening of the region , in which the hall potential varies , even if the filling factor in the center is only slightly below 2 , and the current is confined to the center region .",
    "this asymmetry disappears , however , rapidly as @xmath1 increases above the high-@xmath1 edge of the plateau , as can be seen from the results for @xmath171 t and @xmath203 t in fig .",
    "[ fig : jyuh-9 - 36 ] .",
    "our results are in reasonable agreement with the experiments @xcite , where two cases could be distinguished . near the low-@xmath1 edges of the qh plateaus",
    "an `` edge - dominated behavior '' was found , in which most of the hall potential dropped in an asymmetric way over relatively narrow stripes near the edges of the hall bar . near the high-@xmath1 edges of the qh plateaus",
    "a `` bulk - dominated behavior '' was observed , with the major change of the hall potential near the center of the hall bar .",
    "the exact position of the potential drop changed along the bar , probably due to inhomogeneities .",
    "such inhomogeneities make our assumption of translation invariance a crude approximation to reality , and may be the reason , why in the experiments the bulk - dominated situation is observed in a wider interval of @xmath1-values than in our results .",
    "we find in the edge - dominated situations that the asymmetry of the hall voltages across the iss is connected with a difference in the widths of the iss , notably with a remarkable broadening of the is , which caries the larger current and leads to the larger step in the hall potential . whereas the asymmetry of the potential steps is clearly seen in the experiments , the current - dependence of the width of the corresponding strips",
    "is not clearly observed ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : edgedom ] ) , possibly because of the restricted spatial resolution ( @xmath204 nm ) .",
    "the weak asymmetries seen in fig .  [ fig : jyuh - b735 ] do not contradict to the experimental results for weak imposed currents , but can also not clearly be confirmed by the experiments @xcite . at higher currents ( @xmath205a )",
    "the experimental curves change suddenly their shape @xcite , probably due to the breakdown of the qhe .",
    "the breakdown of the qhe with inreasing current can also be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : edgedom ] , which shows that with increasing @xmath78 the slope of the hall potential in the compressible region between the iss increases .",
    "thus , a part of the current flows through the dissipative bulk , and the resistance is no longer quantized .",
    "our results , on the other hand , say that with increasing @xmath78 one of the iss becomes wider , carries more current dissipationless , and leads to an extension of the qh plateau at its low-@xmath1 edge .",
    "this points to a serious shortcoming of our approach : it does not consider breakdown effects , which may become relevant at high imposed currents .",
    "one of these effects is joule heating , which will become important at these low temperatures , if the current flows , at least partly , through compressible , i.e. dissipative regions .",
    "another one is the often discussed quasi - elastic inter - landau - level - scattering ( quills ) @xcite , which must become important if , in strong in - plane electric fields , isoenergetic states of adjacent landau bands tend to overlap spatially .",
    "exactly this happens at the wide is with the large potential step @xmath192 and the width @xmath206 .",
    "there the landau energies have a slope @xmath207 , so that the spacing of the states @xmath208 and @xmath209 with equal energies @xmath210 is @xmath211 , and becomes small as @xmath192 increases with increasing current @xmath78 .",
    "apart from these well understood shortcomings of the existing calculations , the self - consistent screening theory provides a good understanding of the experimental results .",
    "the observed difference between `` edge - dominated behavior '' near the low-@xmath1 edges of the qh plateaus and the `` bulk - dominated behavior '' near the high-@xmath1 edges becomes clear from figs .",
    "[ fig : rlhvsb ] and [ fig : jyuh-9 - 36 ] . the edge - dominated behavior results from the two separated incompressible strips , which become narrower and less effective with decreasing @xmath1 . but",
    "near the low-@xmath1 edges of the qh plateaus , the iss dominate the transport and , at fixed finite temperature , the longitudinal resistance decreases exponentially with increasing @xmath1 throughout the whole plateau region ( see fig ..  [ fig : rlhvsb ] ) . the bulk - dominated behavior , on the other hand ,",
    "is determined by the @xmath1-value at which the population of a new landau level starts . at slightly lower @xmath1-values",
    "an incompressible region exists in the center . at slightly larger @xmath1-values only the lower landau level",
    "is nearly filled in the center of the sample , so that the resistivity there is very small . in both cases",
    "the center region determines the transport , which therefore is `` bulk - dominated '' .",
    "a basic assumption of our explanation of the qhe in narrow hall bars is , of course , that the lateral confinement of the 2des introduces a position - dependence of the electron density , which decreases from a maximum in the center to zero near the edges of the sample .",
    "we are grateful to klaus von klitzing for his continuing interest in and his support of this work ."
