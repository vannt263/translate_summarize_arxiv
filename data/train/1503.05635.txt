    "magnetic fields in neutron stars play an important role in the interpretation of many observed phenomena . indeed , strongly magnetized neutron stars ( dubbed _ magnetars _ @xcite ) hold the key to understanding the asymmetry in supernova ( sn ) remnants and the still unresolved mechanism for non - spherical sn explosions . such strong magnetic fields",
    "are also closely related to the unknown origin of the kick velocity  @xcite that proto - neutron stars ( pnss ) receive at birth .",
    "it is widely accepted that soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) correspond to magnetars @xcite , and that the associate strong magnetic fields have a significant role in production high energy photons .",
    "furthermore , short duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) may arise from highly magnetized neutron stars @xcite or mergers of binary neutron stars @xcite , and the most popular theoretical models for the long - duration grbs @xcite invoke magnetized accretion disks around neutron stars or rotating black holes ( collapsars ) for their central engines .",
    "such magnetars ( or black holes with strong magnetic fields ) have also been proposed @xcite as an acceleration site for ultra high - energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) and a possible association between magnetar flares @xcite and uhecrs has also been observed .    when a particle is accelerated in an external field or in collision with another particle , it can emit quanta corresponding to the field with which the particle interacts .",
    "synchrotron radiation can be produced by high - energy protons accelerated in an environment containing a strong magnetic field .",
    "this process has been proposed as a source for high - energy photons in the gev @xmath0 tev range @xcite , possibly in association with grbs .",
    "synchrotron emission , however , can occur through any quanta that may couple to an accelerated particle . since protons strongly couple to meson fields ,",
    "a high - energy proton can also radiate pions and other mesons , as well as photons .",
    "in fact , the meson - nucleon couplings are about 100 times larger than the photon - nucleon coupling , and the meson production process is expected to exceed photon synchrotron emission in the high energy regime .",
    "for example , refs .",
    "@xcite addressed the possibility of @xmath1 emission from a proton in a strong magnetic field .",
    "however , these calculations were performed approximately ; i.e. in a semi - classical way and an approximate quantum - mechanical treatment of the proton transitions among the landau levels of the strong magnetic field .    in the semi - classical approach for the production of synchrotron radiation ,",
    "the magnetic field strength is characterized by the curvature parameter , @xmath2 , given in terms of the incident particle mass @xmath3 , its energy @xmath4 , and the curvature radius @xmath5 . for @xmath6",
    ", the radiation can be treated in a classical way .",
    "for example , in a gravitation field or a relatively small electro - magnetic field , charged particles may have such large curvature radii .",
    "however , for @xmath7 _ i.e. _ , very high energetic particles propagating in the very small curvature radius of a strong magnetic field , quantum effects must be taken into account .",
    "since we consider a proton propagating in a strong magnetic field , which may imply a small lamor radius @xmath8 , the radiation should be also treated in a quantum mechanical way along with the landau quantization by the magnetic field .    for proton propagation in a strong magnetic field ,",
    "the value of @xmath9 can be given as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the magnetic field perpendicular to the proton momentum direction .",
    "for illustration , we assume a 1 @xmath13 5 gev proton propagating in a strong magnetic field with @xmath14 g , for which @xmath15 . through analysis of the pion emission based on a quantum field theory treatment , we show that the pion emission can be comparable to the photon emission .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that the anomalous magnetic moment of the charged particle plays a vital roles in the pion synchrotron emission .    in this work , we exploit the green s function method for the propagation of protons in a strong magnetic field .",
    "this approach has not previously been applied to derive pion synchrotron emission . for the pion - nucleon coupling ,",
    "the @xmath16-wave interaction is dominant , and the pion emission amplitude is mainly proportional to @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the emitted pion momentum . because the pion emission along the direction of the magnetic field is not allowed by the conservation of energy - momentum",
    ", @xmath19 has a dominant contribution .",
    "hence , the spin - flip contributions necessary for pseudo - scalar emission are significant .",
    "section 2 is devoted to an introduction of our theoretical formalism based upon the green s function method .",
    "numerical results are presented in section 3 along with detailed discussions .",
    "a summary and conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
