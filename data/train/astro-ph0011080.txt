    "many ( or all ! ) of the radio sources related with x - ray binaries have been resolved into relativistic jets , often with detectable proper motion of the radio - emitting blobs .",
    "we present results of long - term daily monitoring of a sample of these rjxrbs with the ratan-600 radio telescope at 0.96 , 2.3 , 3.9 , 7.7 , 11.2 and 21.7  ghz .",
    "many strong optically thin and thick flares were detected during the monitoring period ( see bursov and trushkin , 1996 ; trushkin , 1998 ) .",
    "the basic model of the flares is the synchrotron emission evolution of two relativistic jets with conical geometry and an adiabatic expansion of the blobs , which are composed of relativistic electrons embedded in magnetic fields , moving away from the central source ( shklovskii , 1960 ; van der laan , 1966 ; hjellming and johnston , 1988 ; marti et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "the flare decay law is determined by the geometry of the conical hollow jets .",
    "the jet velocity , thermal and relativistic electron densities , and magnetic field intensity within the blobs can be derived from the fits .",
    "our monitoring of radio variability of rjxrb shows that the decay of a flare follows a power law , @xmath0 , as predicted by the shklovskii and van der laan models , or an exponential law @xmath1 ( fig.1 ) , which is due to the initial exponential increase of the jet cone radius .",
    "often @xmath2 , where @xmath3 ranged from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ; these flares decay faster at higher frequencies ( see current light curves and the spectra animation at ` http://cats.sao.ru/~satr/xb/ ` ) .",
    "we computed the power spectra of the daily light curves of ss433 in the 2.322  ghz range during the long quiescent periods may ",
    "july 1997 and may ",
    "august 1999 .",
    "both spectra show a mean harmonic at @xmath6 , which corresponds to a period of @xmath7 days .",
    "we propose that doppler boosting of the jet radiation could explain such modulation .",
    "the 5-elements kinematical model of the jets and ephemerides proposed by vermeulen ( 1989 ) for the nodding motion of the jets and common formulas for boosting produce a modulation similar to the observed one .",
    "thus we detect a 6-day modulation at the 1015% level in the quiescent flux density , which is @xmath8 = 1.2 \\ \\nu_{\\rm ghz } ^{-0.6}$ ] .",
    "three powerful flaring events ( up to 13  jy ) from cyg x-3 were detected in april 2000 .",
    "the daily spectra clearly show two components : i ) a quasi - stable steep spectrum and ii ) a very unstable flat spectrum ."
