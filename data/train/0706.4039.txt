    "there is a general agreement that the classical space - time structure as described by the theory of general relativity will undergo drastic modifications at very small distances and very large energies due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "it is commonly argued that the relevant scales at which some new phenomena caused by quantum gravity ( qg ) occur are determined by a combination of newton s constant @xmath0 , planck s constant @xmath1 and the velocity of light in vacuo @xmath2 , i.e. by the planck length @xmath3 cm or equivalently the planck energy @xmath4 or the planck mass @xmath5 @xmath6 . until recently it was thought it would be almost impossible to detect the effects of such extremely short length scales or large energies .",
    "although a full quantum theory of gravity has not yet been established it has been realized that some generic predictions seem to emerge from the various approaches to a theory of qg .",
    "assuming that qg possesses a well defined semiclassical limit which is obtained for weak gravitational fields and/or low energies , @xmath7 , one can look for falsifiable predictions from semiclassical qg to first order in @xmath8 .",
    "one of the most striking predictions is a distortion of the photon dispersion relation @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 denote the photon energy and momentum , respectively , @xmath12 is a model - dependent dimensionless parameter of order unity and @xmath2 is the ( standard low - energy ) velocity of light in vacuo .",
    "the non - standard dispersion relation leads to an energy - dependent velocity of light , @xmath13 , defined by the group velocity @xmath14 : @xmath15 the corrections to the velocity of light of the form could be interpreted as an explicit violation of lorentz invariance at the planck scale .",
    "for example , there may exist a preferred frame which is commonly chosen to be the frame that coincides with the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background radiation , implying that light would have a helicity - dependent velocity . in @xcite a more general dispersion relation with lorentz symmetry breaking terms that depend explicitly on the helicity of the photon was studied and bounds on the qg scale from different astrophysical sources were given .",
    "however , observations of synchrotron radiation in the crab nebula @xcite tend to rule out a helicity - dependent velocity of light .",
    "another possibility to understand a possible violation of lorentz invariance , as proposed e.g. in non - critical string theory @xcite , string theory @xcite or effective field theory approaches @xcite , is to interpret the energy - dependent velocity of light as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the refraction index of the non - trivial optical properties of the `` foamy '' structure of space - time caused by quantum fluctuations on short time and distance scales .",
    "a very promising approach to qg is loop quantum gravity ( for reviews see @xcite ) , where modifications of the type - are present in the 2 + 1 dimensional theory @xcite and where it is conjectured @xcite that the same will be true in qg in 3 + 1 dimensions . in this theory , the corrections are understood as indicating not a breaking of lorentz invariance but rather a deformation of it .",
    "one assumes that the relativity of inertial frames is preserved , however , one requires that there be _ two _ constant scales which are observer - independent : the standard velocity of light @xmath2 and the planck length @xmath18 ( or equivalently @xmath4 ) .",
    "it has been shown that lorentz invariant theories satisfying these requirements exist if the lorentz transformations are treated not in the standard way , but are realized non - linearly when acting on energy and momentum eigenstates .",
    "such theories are called doubly or deformed special relativity ( dsr ) @xcite .",
    "different realizations of dsr lead to a different energy dependence of the velocity of light .",
    "however , a common feature of all dsr models is that the velocity of light does not depend on helicity .",
    "note , however , that in @xcite it was argued that , in order to construct a quantum field theory that consistently incorporates dsr , it should not depend on extensive quantities like the total four momentum of particles but rather on intensive quantities like the fields energy and momentum densities .",
    "this not only solves the soccer - ball problem but also changes drastically the predicted effects by many orders of magnitude . as shown there , the effect of the `` new dsr '' is about 57 orders of magnitude smaller than predicted by the `` old dsr '' , thus making dsr hardly measurable .    in view of the fact that there exists a large variety of approaches to qg which lead to an energy - dependent velocity of light of the form",
    ", it seems worthwhile to seek experimental tests of .",
    "it was pointed out that one powerful way to probe may be provided by gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite .",
    "several studies have been conducted using measurements of grbs @xcite .",
    "grbs are the most distant variable astrophysical sources of energetic photons detected by present experiments in the energy range from kev to gev .",
    "in this paper we shall consider the following form of the velocity of light @xmath19 where we have put the constant @xmath12 equal to @xmath20 and replaced the planck mass @xmath21 by a qg mass @xmath22 to be determined or constrained by grbs .",
    "furthermore , we have neglected the higher order terms because the energy @xmath10 of the photons emitted by the available grbs detected by integral are much smaller than the expected energy scale @xmath23 representing the qg effects .    light propagation from grbs",
    "is not only determined by the velocity of light but is also affected by the cosmological expansion of the universe .",
    "present observations are consistent with a nearly ( spatially ) flat universe . in the following we shall assume , for simplicity , an exactly flat universe described by the @xmath24cdm model consisting of baryonic matter ( bar ) , cold dark matter ( cdm ) and a positive cosmological constant @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 with @xmath26 . the time delay between two photons with an energy difference @xmath27 is then given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hubble constant ( @xmath30 gyr ) .",
    "assuming an energy difference @xmath31 kev and a redshift @xmath32 we get a time lag of approximately @xmath33 s for @xmath34 .    in spite of the fact that grb signals are interesting for searching for qg effects , they are far from being perfect , mainly due to our lack of knowledge of the internal physical processes which are at the origin of the light emission .",
    "it is conceivable that photons of different energies are produced by different mechanisms within the grb , thus narrowing the energy range in which a comparison between arrival times is possible .    in this paper",
    "we study possible time lags from grb light curves detected by integral .",
    "contrary to previous studies @xcite where a binning in time and energy was used , we use unbinned data , i.e. we know the arrival time and energy of every single photon detected by the satellite . in order not to destroy this valuable piece of information",
    "we will not use wavelets as was done in the cases described above but rather use a new method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in we describe the relevant properties of integral and in our method to analyze the unbinned data .",
    "in we present the results of the monte carlo simulations .",
    "contains the results using grbs detected by integral , and we finish with the conclusions in .",
    "integral @xcite is a mission of the european space agency ( esa ) devoted to gamma ray astronomy .",
    "it features a coded mask instrument isgri @xcite .",
    "this instrument enables us to measure for each photon in the energy range 15 kev to 1 mev the arrival time with a precision of @xmath35 s as well as the energy with a precision of 10% .",
    "the detector has a dead time of about 25% .",
    "this dead time is a function of the incoming rate and can vary during a grb .",
    "the dead time is measured internally by the instrument and is given as a mean dead time over 8 seconds independently for 6 parts of the detector .",
    "it can be corrected statistically in weighing each incoming photon by @xmath36 with the corresponding time slice and detector part dead time .",
    "if the rate exceeds telemetry capabilities a data gap is created in wich the dead time is 100% . in this case",
    "it can not be statistically corrected and we have a hole in the data versus time .",
    "this unfortunately happens frequently during very intense grbs .",
    "the instrument also registers an important rate from the background due to diffuse photons from the sky , internal radioactivity of the instrument and flux from sources present in the field of view .",
    "this background rate varies with time but not perceptibly during the typical time scale of a grb .",
    "we have two ways of predicting this background . before and after the grb the background can be measured as the full rate registered by the instrument . during the grb , the pixels that are in the shadow of the mask for the direction of the grb register only the background photons of the grb .",
    "the illuminated pixels register this background as well as the flux from the grbs . statistically the rate from the grb can be computed by properly weighed subtraction .",
    "as , most of the time , the grbs are in the partially coded field of view , the number of pixels available for background measurement is bigger than the number of pixels seeing the source .",
    "the fraction of a pixel that is illuminated by the grb ( so called pif value ) can be calculated with the knowledge of the coordinate of the grb and the knowledge of the attitude of the instrument .",
    "we are not able to determine individually if a photon comes from the grb or the background , but the pif can be used to properly weigh its probability to come from the grb .",
    "for example , a light curve can be built by using only pixels that are fully illuminated by the source and removing the constant rate measured by the completely opaque pixels .",
    "the majority of the grbs seems to follow a pattern called fast raise and exponential decay ( fred ) . in order to model a grb light curve ,",
    "we parameterize it with five parameters and call the resulting probability distribution @xmath37 ( see ) .",
    "we suppose that a set of measured parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 came from the probability density function @xmath40 .",
    "we use the method of maximum likelihood , which consists of finding the set of values @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which maximizes the joint probability distribution for all data , given by @xmath47 together with the constraint @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the likelihood function and the integral runs between @xmath50 and @xmath51 as shown in .",
    "in fact , the condition ( [ constraint ] ) that the integral over time be equal to one reduces the degrees of freedom for @xmath40 and @xmath49 by one .",
    "for example , @xmath52 can be chosen to be fixed by this condition , so we can think of @xmath40 and @xmath49 as not depending on @xmath52 . however , for clarity we write the @xmath52-term dependence for both functions .",
    "it is easier to search for the parameters that maximize @xmath53 , as the products on the right hand side of is now a sum . to find these parameters",
    ", we use a multidimensional unconstrained nonlinear minimization where we minimize the function @xmath54 .",
    "is the background level , @xmath55 the duration of the rise , @xmath56 the height above the background , @xmath57 the decay time for @xmath58 and @xmath59 describes the magnitude of the dependence on the energy of the distribution @xmath40 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the time when the intensity reaches a maximum and @xmath10 is the photon energy .",
    "the area under the curve must be one , so that one parameter , e.g. @xmath52 , is fixed by this condition .",
    "the dashed line shows a distribution for another energy interval that is shifted by an amount of @xmath62 sketching the shift in time due to quantum gravitational effects .",
    "this shift is usually much smaller than the other parameters.,width=283 ]    shows a typical light curve of a grb .",
    "we always choose time intervals so that such a sketch can be found .",
    "however , in order to avoid wrong results , we also take account for other possibilities when for example @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "the maximum shift in time due to quantum gravity is expected to be of the order of @xmath65 s , which is smaller by a factor of three than the time resolution of integral .",
    "therefore , it is at first highly questionable whether such time differences can be measured , not to speak of the results gotten from unbinned data . in order to get a better feeling of the behavior of the likelihood",
    ", we performed monte carlo simulations with a total number of photons ranging from 500 to unrealistic 300000 .",
    "first , we created @xmath66 events @xmath67 with energy @xmath39 distributed according to a typical grb event .",
    "that is , a typical energy distribution for the photons of grbs follows the pattern of the so - called band function @xcite given by the following equation : @xmath68 ^{\\alpha-\\beta}\\left ( \\frac{e}{100\\;\\mathrm{kev}}\\right ) ^{\\beta}\\exp(\\beta-\\alpha),\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad(\\alpha-\\beta)e_0\\leq e,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we choose typical values for the parameters , i.e. @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 kev ( see left panel of ) .    ) , the total photon number is 5000 .",

    "a crude way of evaluating the statistics necessary for a convincing measurement is to make the assumption that the fred distribution may be approximated by a gaussian distribution .",

    "<S> the advantage of this satellite is that we have at our disposal the energy and arrival time of every detected single photon , which enhances the precision of the time resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we present a new method for seeking time lags in unbinned data using a maximum likelihood method and support our conclusions with monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the data yields a mass scale well below the planck mass whose value may however increase if better statistics of grbs were available . </S>",
