    "all - sky radio continuum surveys provide basic information on our local environment and the large - scale properties of the galaxy .",
    "they are required to model the galactic emission components in 3-d ( sun _ et al . _",
    "( 2008 ) ) and guide more sensitive higher - angular resolution observations of the galactic plane or other regions or objects of interest .",
    "all - sky surveys are quite time consuming projects , which require special observing methods to accurately measure large - scale sky emission .",
    "they need similar telescopes in the northern and southern hemisphere and have to adapt calibration data from additional instruments to provide the absolute level of sky emission .",
    "thus all - sky surveys are rare , in particular in linear polarization , where the signals are much weaker than in total intensities .    in the following",
    "we describe the basic methods to calibrate and adjust total intensity surveys as well as the more complex requirements being applied for polarization surveys .",
    "we do not discuss the instrumental corrections to be taken into account during the data reduction process , which can be found in the original publications .",
    "when pointing a radio telescope to a certain sky direction we record - beside the signal of interest - a variety of other much stronger signals . the observed signal can be expressed as a temperature @xmath0 :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the contribution from all components of the receiving system , typically 20  k to 30  k for a cooled receiver for cm - wavelength observations .",
    "@xmath3 is the contribution from the atmosphere , typically a few k , depending on elevation and the actual weather conditions .",
    "@xmath4 is the emission picked up by the sidelobes of a telescope from the ground , thus depending on azimuth and elevation .",
    "@xmath5 is the wavelength independent isotropic radiation from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) of 2.73  k ( mather _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) ) .",
    "@xmath6 also is an isotropic component resulting from unresolved weak extragalactic sources .",
    "@xmath6 depends on wavelength and beam size .",
    "@xmath7 is the diffuse galactic background emission and , finally , @xmath8 the signal of interest from a specific galactic or extragalactic source . @xmath8 and - in the case of galactic surveys - @xmath7 are to be separated from the other components in an appropriate way .",
    "the problem is the weakness of the sky emission compared to the other contributions to @xmath0 .",
    "relative measurements are the standard mode for continuum and polarization observations , when the signal from a source or a certain region of the sky is of interest . in that case",
    "the region surrounding the source or the source complex is refered to as the zero - level and the difference signal is taken as @xmath8 .",
    "this is justified in case the measurements of the source signal and its adjacent zero - level are not suffering from time or telescope position dependent changes of the unwanted contributions in an unpredictable way .",
    "galactic diffuse emission shows intrinsic variations , which might become a problem when they mix up with emission from extended faint sources , e.g. a large diameter supernova remnant ( snr ) , and can not be separated .",
    "thus large errors for integrated flux densities reported for extended snrs are very common .",
    "an absolute measurement means that the entire signal from the sky is recovered and the three terms @xmath9 are subtracted .",
    "this is required for galactic total intensity and polarization all - sky surveys , but not easy to obtain with high precision at decimeter and shorter wavelengths .",
    "the two isotropic sky components @xmath5 and @xmath6 do nt matter in this context .",
    "special observing and reduction procedures are applied for survey observations .",
    "for instance , very long scans across the sky are observed along the same azimuth or elevation range to ensure that @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 are as constant as possible , while the sky emission varies as a function of time . from an appropriate analysis of a large number of scans individual corrections for each scan against the mean of all scans",
    "can be calculated .",
    "the final all - sky survey map is constructed from these corrected scans .",
    "nevertheless , the maps often show striping effects along the scan direction at the noise level or exceeding it , which indicate residuals from the correction procedures .",
    "in general distortions of the measurements on short time scales , e.g. by weather changes or variing low - level rfi , are more difficult to correct than smooth changes of the baseline level by temperature effects over a night .",
    "continuum all - sky surveys receive their zero - level calibration by using low - resolution sky horn data .",
    "their antenna diagrams are well known to enable a proper far - sidelobe correction .",
    "reference loads at precisely known temperatures are required to find @xmath2 .",
    "the all - sky surveys need to be convolved to the beam size of the sky horns , which are typically several degrees , to find the temperature offset . this way the 1.42  ghz survey ( fig .",
    "1 ) was calibrated to an accuracy of 0.5  k  @xmath10 .",
    "the 408  mhz survey by haslam _",
    "( 1982 ) has a zero - level accuracy of about 3  k  @xmath10 .",
    "this accuracy is lower than the sensitivity ( 3  x  r.m.s - noise ) of both surveys of 0.05  k  @xmath10 and 2k  @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the probably most famous sky horn observations are those by penzias & wilson ( 1965 ) leading to the discovery of the 3  k cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "this led to the award of the nobel prize in 1978 .",
    "their absolute measurements revealed an isotropic sky component of 3.5  k , interpreted by dicke _",
    "et al . _ ( 1965 ) to originate from the cmb .",
    "this 4.08  ghz measurement of 3.5  k happened at a time , when relative measurements in the mk  range were regularly made .",
    "this clearly reflects the technical challenges for these kind of measurements .",
    "ground based surveys carried out at different frequencies with their zero - level adapted from sky horn measurements may be further adjusted relative to each other by using the so - called tt - plot method according to turtle _",
    "et al . _ ( 1962 ) .",
    "this method was discussed in some detail by reich _",
    "the surveys to be adjusted were convolved to a common angular resolution of 15@xmath11 and the tt - plots were performed for a strip in right ascension for declinations between 30@xmath11 and 45@xmath11 , where no contamination from local structures like the giant loops is evident .",
    "as an example we show the tt - plot between the 408  mhz survey by haslam _",
    "et al . _ ( 1982 ) and the 1420  mhz survey by reich ( 1982 ) in fig .  2 ( left panel ) after a zero - level correction of -2.7  k for the 408  mhz survey .",
    "this correction is within its quoted zero - level error of 3  k. the mean of the fitted lines passes 0  k at both wavelengths .",
    "this result assumes the 1420  mhz survey to be correct , although the sky horn data are uncertain by 0.5  k. using several pairs of surveys improves and constrains the corrections ( see reich _",
    "( 2004 ) for details ) .",
    "the wmap total intensity all - sky surveys provide valuable high - frequency maps of galactic emission and are of similar low - angular resolution compared to the ground based surveys up to 1.4  ghz .",
    "unfortunately the wmap total intensity maps have not yet set on an absolute zero - level .",
    "the three year s release ( hinshaw _ et al . _",
    "( 2007 ) ) at 22.8  ghz shows numerous small patches at high latitudes with temperatures below -100  @xmath12k , which is incorrect .",
    "we used the tt - plot technique to adjust the wmap 22.8  ghz map in respect to 1420  mhz ( see fig .",
    "2 , right panel ) and find an offset of 250@xmath13k .",
    "for the recent wmap release of five years observations ( hinshaw _ et al .",
    "_ , preprint ) , an offset of 260@xmath13k using the same method .",
    "this is quite a significant correction and has a clear effect on the spectral index between 1420  mhz and 22.8  ghz .",
    "the most frequent high - latitude temperature spectral indices increase from about -3.1 ( without correction ) to about -2.8 , which is just slightly steeper ( by about 0.1 ) compared to the spectra between 408  mhz and 1420  mhz .",
    "k.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ] k.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    absolute sky measurements with high precision are needed to calibrate the wmap total intensity maps .",
    "this is expected from arcade ( kogut _ et al . _",
    "( 2006 ) ) , a balloon - borne instrument designed to measure the absolute sky temperature between 3.3  ghz and 90  ghz in a number of channels .",
    "this exeriment will provide high - precision low - resolution data of galactic emission .",
    "current galactic plane surveys were carried out with large single - dish telescopes at arcmin angular resolution to resolve diffuse galactic emission structures from individual sources like snrs or hii - regions .",
    "synthesis telescope surveys achieve even higher angular resolutions .",
    "these surveys use all - sky surveys to add the missing large - scale information and adjust their zero - level .",
    "this has been done using the total intensity northern sky 1.4  ghz survey ( fig .  1 ) to adjust 1.4  ghz effelsberg total intensity surveys ( kallas & reich 1980 ; reich _ et al . _",
    "( 1990 , 1997 ) ; uyaniker _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) ) .",
    "these combined data at about 9 angular resolution were used to calibrate the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ) carried out with the synthesis telescope at drao / penticton as described by taylor _",
    "( 2003 ) , thus providing a survey including all structural information larger than 1. similarly the cgps survey at 408  mhz uses the all - sky survey carried out by haslam _",
    "et al . _ ( 1982 ) with the effelsberg , parkes and jodrell bank telescopes at that frequency .",
    "the scheme for relative and absolute zero - level calibration of polarization data , which means the calibration of the observed stokes u and q maps , in principle follows that of total intensity data : the absolute zero - level is required for all - sky maps and a relative zero - level setting is sufficient for polarized sources .",
    "the only ground - based all - sky polarization survey was made at 1.4  ghz by wolleben _",
    "( 2006 ) for the northern hemisphere using the drao 26-m telescope and by testori _",
    "( 2008 ) using one of the villa elisa 30-m telescopes for the southern sky , where the different calibration steps are discussed .",
    "the absolute zero - level of this polarization survey is adapted to 1.4  ghz measurements with the dwingeloo 25-m telescope published by brouw & spoelstra ( 1976 ) , where rotating dipoles were used allowing to separate sky emission from ground radiation contamination .",
    "the polarization intensity scale of these surveys , however , was adjusted by using smoothed polarization data from the effelsberg or the parkes telescopes , respectively .",
    "we show the combined all - sky 1.4  ghz polarization survey ( reich _ et al .",
    "_ , in prep . ) in fig .  3 .    for the interpretation of galactic polarization emerging from faraday rotation in the interstellar medium , also the step of absolute zero - level calibration",
    "is required .",
    "otherwise any interpretation becomes problematic , as it was discussed in some detail by reich ( 2006 ) .",
    "polarization features emerging from faraday rotation are in general not or very weakly related to total intensity sources or emission structures .",
    "the effect of zero - level calibration is different for polarized emission , because vectors are added , while for total intensities it is a scalar .",
    "polarized emission pi and polarization angle @xmath14 are calculated from the observed stokes parameters u and q , assumed to be corrected for all kinds of instrumental effects , by :    @xmath15    adding missing components in @xmath16 and @xmath17 gives :    @xmath18    pi and @xmath14 depend on u(q ) and @xmath19 in a non - linear way .",
    "u(q ) and @xmath19 may have rather different levels and signs , that the inclusion of @xmath19 does not only change the level of pi , but also largely influences the morphology of the observed structures .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "4 , where 1.4  ghz polarized emission observed with the effelsberg 100-m telescope is shown .",
    "the numerous small - scale polarization structures ( canals and rings ) have almost no counterpart in the very smooth total intensity map showing a smooth positive temperature gradient towards the galactic plane and many compact extragalactic sources ( see uyaniker _",
    "( 1999 ) ) .",
    "4 shows the polarized emission as it was observed and after a correction for missing large - scale components provided by the northern sky polarization survey by wolleben _",
    "the polarization level increases including large - scale components , but most remarkable is the change of morphology of the small - scale structures , which may change from absorption into emission structures and vice versa . without the large - scale correction any physical interpretation or radiation transfer modelling of the observed features",
    "is strongly limited .",
    "while the wmap total intensity surveys need a zero - level correction as described above , this does not hold for the polarization data , where the maps are at a correct zero - level .",
    "wmap observes difference signals from two feeds with about @xmath20 viewing angle difference ( bennett _ et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) ) .",
    "other than for stokes i , the stokes parameter u and q have no isotropic component .      with the availability of the 1.4  ghz all - sky polarization survey , galactic plane surveys at 1.4",
    "ghz can be properly calibrated as demonstrated in fig .  4 for a section of the effelsberg 1.4  ghz survey .",
    "the effelsberg maps combined with the drao 26-m survey were then used to correct the 1.4  ghz polarized emission component of the cgps , which results in a galactic plane survey with 1 angular resolution showing unprecedented details of the magnetized interstellar medium ( landecker et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "this survey covers the galactic plane in the longitude range @xmath21 and latitudes between @xmath22 .",
    "the filtering applied to the three surveys before merging the u and q maps is shown in fig .",
    "the wmap polarization survey at 22.8  ghz ( page _ et al . _",
    "( 2007 ) ) proves to be very valuable for the correction of high - resolution polarization data at a few ghz .",
    "faraday rotation of the polarization angles at high latitudes and towards the anti - centre direction are small , that an extrapolation of the wmap u and q maps from 22.8  ghz towards lower frequencies is possible .",
    "this requires the correct spectral index for polarized emission , which should be close to that observed for total intensity synchrotron emission .",
    "for example a rotation measures ( rm ) of 50  rad  @xmath23 causes a polarization angle rotation of about @xmath24 at @xmath256  cm .",
    "this technique was applied to the running sino - german @xmath256  cm ( 4.8 ghz ) polarization survey of the galactic plane , which is carried out with the urumqi 25-m telescope of naoc / china . as described by sun _",
    "( 2007 ) this survey aims to cover the galactic plane for latitudes between @xmath26 with an angular resolution of 9.5 and a rms - sensitivity of 1.4(0.7 )  mk  @xmath10 for total ( polarized ) intensities .",
    "measurements of an absolute polarization level of a few milli - kelvin is a very ambitious task for a multi - purpose instrument like the urumqi 25-m telescope and should be done with dedicated small instruments .",
    "the c - bass project ( pearson & c - bass collaboration 2007 ) might be able to provide this required information .",
    "sun _ et al . _",
    "( 2007 ) published the first survey map from the urumqi @xmath256  cm survey and demonstrated the application of the wmap zero - level correction for an area centered at galactic longitude @xmath27 .",
    "the zero - level offset extrapolated from the smoothed u and q 22.8  ghz maps was found to be -0.3  mk  @xmath10 and 8.3  mk  @xmath10 for u and q , respectively .",
    "the large value for q indicates that the magnetic field runs almost parallel to the galactic plane , as expected .",
    "the observed maps show a lot of diffuse polarized structures partly associated with snrs , but also in the direction of some hii - regions , which act as faraday screens and prove the presence of well - ordered magnetic fields of a few @xmath12 g along the line - of - sight .",
    "of particular interest is a large polarized structure in the field , g125.6 - 1.8 , with a diameter of about 70 showing no signature in total intensity nor in h@xmath28-emission .",
    "this structure changes from a polarized emission structure as seen in the original urumqi map into an absorption structure after wmap calibration .",
    "the properties of this feature were modelled by sun _",
    "( 2007 ) . for a size of 58",
    "pc and a rm of 200  rad  @xmath23 the calculated magnetic field strength exceeds 6.9  @xmath12 g along the line - of - sight for an upper limit of the thermal electron density of 0.84  @xmath29 and assumed spherical symmetry .",
    "such regular magnetic fields exceed the strength of the regular galactic magnetic field , which is about 2@xmath12 g in this area according to han _",
    "the origin of these magnetic bubbles is not known , and it is also yet unclear how numerous they are and to what extent they influence the properties of the magnetized interstellar medium .",
    "structures with such a high rm can not be studied at low frequencies , because small rm fluctuations cause depolarization across the observing beam .",

    "( in prep . ) .",
    "numerous galactic polarized features were already discussed in the literature , but a number of them clearly suffer from insufficient calibration . as an example for a misinterpretation of that kind we discuss the case of the dust complex g159.5 - 18.5 in perseus ( reich & gao , in prep . ) .",
    "g159.5 - 18.5 is an extended source of about @xmath30 in size and very well studied at optical and infrared wavelengths , star light polarization and molecular line emission ( ridge _ et al . _",

    "recently g159.5 - 18.5 received particular attention , because it is one of the very few well established cases , where emission from spinning dust particles was clearly detected .",
    "( 2005 ) presented observations made with the cosmosomas telescope in the frequency range between 11  ghz and 17  ghz , which were combined with wmap data at higher frequencies , showing a spectrum as expected for spinning dust emission , which is clearly in excess over the weak thermal emission .",

    "however , the polarization data are on a relative zero - level in u and q.    watson _ et al . _",
    "( 2005 ) extracted information of the thermal emission component of g159.5 - 18.5 from existing ground based all - sky surveys .",
    "recent pointed observations with the effelsberg 100-m telescope at @xmath2511  cm and the urumqi 25-m telescope at @xmath256  cm with higher quality clearly confirm the existence of optically thin thermal gas in g159.5 - 18.5 with a flux density of about 3.8  jy , more than four times below the flux density of spinning dust seen at cosmosomas wavelengths .",

    "@xmath256  cm , which is not expected to originate from thermal gas .",
    "spinning dust plays no role at @xmath2511  cm wavelength , that the only valid interpretation is that g159.5 - 18.5 acts as a faraday screen hosting a strong regular magnetic field along the line - of - sight .",
