    "protein structure prediction remains to be an open problem in bioinformatics @xcite .",
    "there are two main categories of methods for protein structure prediction : free modeling ( fm ) and template based modeling ( tbm ) .",
    "protein threading , belonging to the category of template based modeling , identifies the most likely fold with the target by making a sequence - structure alignment between target protein and template protein .",
    "though protein threading has been shown to more be successful for protein structure prediction , it performs poorly for remote homology detection .    protein residue - residue contacts play critical role in maintaining the proteins native structures @xcite .",
    "contacts potential has been used to help improve both fm and tbm . for fm ,",
    "the contacts information can help reduce the degrees of freedom in the conformational search space @xcite@xcite@xcite . and for tbm , it can help select the templates sharing similar contact map with the target protein @xcite .",
    "protein threading with contacts potential is np - hard @xcite .",
    "several approximation algorithms have been proposed to tackle this problem .",
    "prospect proposed divide - and - conquer algorithm to find suboptimal threading alignment @xcite .",
    "raptor formulates the threading problem as an integer linear programming ( ilp ) and then ilp formulation is relaxed to a linear programming ( lp ) problem , which is solved by the canonical branch - and - bound method @xcite .",
    "mrfalign formulates the threading problem as a quadratic programming problem and then solve it using alternate direction alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) technique @xcite .    in this paper , we will present our treethreader program based on tree conditional random field ( treecrf ) model .",
    "not only treecrf can capture global contact potential , but also the inference in treecrf is efficient . in treecrf ,",
    "the contact pairs of the template are selected to construct a nested graph .",
    "the special nested structure allows efficient inference to find the optimum threading alignment . from the view of graphical model",
    ", treecrf makes a compromise between model capacity and model complexity .",
    "as shown in figure [ figure : tree_hardness ] , the inference in chaincrf is efficient @xcite , but it can capture global dependence .",
    "in contrast , crf with general graph structure can capture global dependence , but the inference is very hard .",
    "the inference in treecrf is efficient and it can capture global dependence .",
    "given the template protein and the target protein , the framework of our threading method is as follows .    1 .",
    "calculate the contact map of the template .",
    "2 .   select the most informative contact pairs of the template using dynamic programming .",

    "+    we organize this section as follows . in section [ sec : nested ] , we will give the dynamic programming algorithm for selecting the most informative contact pairs of the template . then in section",
    "[ sec : treecrf ] , we will describe our treecrf model and the details of the inference algorithm . in section [ sec :",
    "features ] , we will describe the alignment features used in treecrf .",
    "+      given a contact map @xmath0 , we select the most informative contact pairs by solving the following optimization problem .",
    "@xmath1    here , @xmath2 means the contact potential measuring the importance of the contact pair @xmath3 .",
    "two kinds of contact potential are used in our method : 1 ) mutual information ( mi ) between the sequence profiles of the two residues .",
    "2 ) liang - potential @xcite .",
    "we solve the optimization problem [ eq : nested ] using the following dynamic programming algorithm .",
    "@xmath4     here , @xmath5 denotes the optimum from residue the @xmath6 to the residue @xmath7 .",
    "the optimal nested graph can be constructed by the standard traceback procedure of the dynamic programming algorithm .",
    "+    each nested graph can be represented by a serial of nodes with different types ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "type of the node indicates the direction of the subgraph ( left , right , pair and bifurcation ) .",
    "for example , the nested graph in figure [ figure : nested_example ] can be represented as \\{@xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19}.      let @xmath20 denote a template protein and @xmath21 a target protein .",
    "each protein is associated with some protein features , such as sequence profile and secondary structure .",
    "let @xmath22 denote an alignment between @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath8 is the alignment length and @xmath23 is one of the three possible states @xmath24 ( match ) , @xmath25 ( insertion ) , @xmath26 ( delete ) .",

    "viterbi algorithm is used to calculated the optimal alignment by maximizing the alignment probability .",
    "@xmath35     all the above three algorithm are standard dynamic programming algorithms with time complexity @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the length of the template protein and the target protein respectively .",
    "in contrast , we developed outside algorithm and inside algorithm to calculate the partial alignment probability and tree - viterbi algorithm to calculate the optimal alignment .",

    "we developed a novel protein threading tool named treethreader .",
