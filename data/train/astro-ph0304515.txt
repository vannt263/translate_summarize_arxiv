    "the bodmer - witten proposal that symmetric deconfined u , d , s - quark matter may be the absolute ground state of matter and forms the so - called strange stars @xcite has aroused much interest , and the properties of strange stars have been widely studied @xcite .",
    "an important question is whether the observed compact stars are neutron stars or strange stars .",
    "one possibility to distinguish the two is to study their cooling curves , which are significantly different @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effects of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase transition on the cooling of a compact star and possible signatures of the quark phase .",
    "regardless of the validity of the bodmer - witten proposal , the formation of quark - gluon plasma should be favoured in high temperature and density @xcite ; we therefore suggest that a strange star may be formed just after a supernova explosion , in which both conditions are satisfied @xcite . because the initial temperature is so high @xcite @xmath1 , the initial compact star is likely to be a bare strange star @xcite .",
    "when it cools down to the phase transition temperature @xmath2 , the quark matter becomes energetically unstable compared to nuclear matter , and the strange star will convert to a neutron star . the conversion energy released during this qcd phase transition can be of the order @xmath0 erg .",
    "the temperature drops drastically at the completion of the phase transition , which is accompanied by the emission of a second neutrino burst due to the higher neutrino emissivity of neutron matter .    in section 2",
    ", we will first present the equation of state ( eos ) that we use in the calculation for the quark phase .",
    "this is then followed by a discussion of the stability properties of strange stars in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the study of the phase transition scenario , which is fixed once the eos s are chosen .",
    "we then discuss the cooling processes of strange stars in section 5 , and the results of our calculation are presented in section 6 .",
    "we summarize in section 7 .",
    "lattice qcd calculation of @xmath2 is highly uncertain at high chemical potential , but the latest results @xcite indicate , though with relatively large uncertainties at high chemical potential , that @xmath3 drops from its zero density value of 140 mev to about 50 mev at 1.5 times nuclear matter density @xmath4 and down to a few mev for density a few times @xmath5 .",
    "some previous proto - neutron star evolution calculations indeed show that it is feasible to reach the phase transition in supernovae @xcite . while there are still large uncertainties in both high density qcd and the proto - neutron star evolution , we believe it is worthwhile studying the possible consequences of the qcd phase transition in supernovae . we assume a constant @xmath2 in the star and present results for @xmath6 mev for comparison .",
    "we adopt the simple picture that matter at temperature above ( below ) @xmath2 is in the quark ( hadronic ) phase .    to study the properties of quark matter , various eos s have been used .",
    "the mit bag model is most widely used due to its simple analytic form @xcite . here",
    "we follow fraga @xmath7 @xmath8 @xcite and use the eos derived from perturbative qcd for cold , dense quark matter up to second order in the strong coupling constant @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 becomes small in the high density limit , with a value of about 0.4 in the relevant density regime .",
    "it turns out that this eos is very similar to the mit bag model eos , with an effective bag constant @xcite , and we would have obtained basically the same results using the latter .",
    "none of our results in the cooling calculation depends on the validity of perturbative qcd in compact star regime .",
    "all thermodynamic properties can be obtained from the thermodynamic potential @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the chemical potential . at zero quark mass limit , the number densities of u ,",
    "d , s quarks are the same , and hence charge neutrality is automatically satisfied , without any need of electrons .",
    "the zero temperature perturbative qcd thermodynamic potential has been calculated up to order @xmath13 @xcite in the modified minimal subtraction scheme @xcite : ( ) = - \\{1 - 2_s - ^2 } , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the number of quark flavors , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the renormalization subtraction point , and @xmath21 \\right\\ } \\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath22 , @xmath23 mev , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "it is believed that @xmath28 lies in the range between 2 and 3 @xcite .",
    "both the first and second order terms decrease the pressure of the strange quark matter relative to the ideal gas .",
    "the pressure depends weakly on the strange quark mass @xmath29 , changing only by less than 5% for @xmath29 up to 150 mev @xcite .",
    "we will therefore use the massless eos in the calculation .",
    "the structure of a static , non - rotating and spherically symmetric strange star can be calculated by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equations together with the eos @xcite .",
    "a strange star can be stable even at zero temperature if its binding energy is larger than that of a neutron star with the same baryonic mass , which is indeed the case for @xmath28 around 2.7 ( see table i ) , for several commonly used neutron star eos s @xcite .",
    "we are however interested in the possibility that strange quark matter is only stable for @xmath30 , and so we choose a @xmath31 , so that when the hot strange star cools to low temperature , it will convert to a neutron star . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the maximum gravitational mass is @xmath33 with a baryonic mass of @xmath34 and radius @xmath35 km .",
    "we will use this set of parameters in the calculation of the cooling behaviour because the maximum mass is close to observational data of compact stars .",
    "in fact , we have also used other values of @xmath28 , and the cooling behavior is qualitatively similar , as long as the star undergoes a phase transition .",
    "it has long been suggested that strange stars can be formed from a phase transition of neutron stars to strange stars due to an abrupt increase in density @xcite .",
    "however , from the theoretical point of view , formation of quark - gluon plasma is favoured when both temperature and chemical potential are high enough @xcite .",
    "we propose that strange stars are formed in supernovae where both the temperature and density are high , with initial temperature @xcite @xmath36 .",
    "the star then cools to @xmath2 and hadronizes into a neutron star containing ordinary baryons .",
    "this is just the same scenario believed to occur in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "if the baryonic mass @xmath37 is conserved during the phase transition , the total conversion energy @xmath38 released is : e_=[m_g(ss)-m_g(ns)]c^2 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the gravitational masses of the strange star and neutron star respectively @xcite . whether a phase transition can occur and how much energy is released depend on both the eos s of quark matter and nuclear matter .",
    "we choose several commonly used neutron star eos s , @xmath41 @xcite , and the conversion energy for different @xmath28 are summarized in table i. for @xmath32 , typically @xmath0 erg is released during the conversion process , which depends only weakly on the nuclear matter eos .",
    "the surface of a newborn strange star is so hot that all the materials , other than quark matter , are evaporated leaving the strange star nearly bare without any crust @xcite .",
    "since the thermal conductivity of strange matter is high and the density profile of the strange star is very flat , we take the uniform temperature and density approximation .",
    "the strange star cools according to : c_q =- l_q , where @xmath42 is the total heat capacity of all the species in quark matter , and @xmath43 is the total luminosity of the star .",
    "when the temperature drops to @xmath2 , the star undergoes a phase transition releasing a conversion energy @xmath38 .    during the phase transition",
    ", we assume that the quark and neutron matter are distributed uniformly and calculate the luminosity of the mixed phase by the weighted average of those of the quark matter and the neutron matter  @xcite .",
    "when the strange star has converted completely to a neutron star , it then follows the standard cooling of a neutron star with an initial temperature of @xmath2 .",
    "the detailed thermal evolution is governed by several energy transport equations .",
    "we adopt a simple model that a neutron star has a uniform temperature core with high conductivity and two layers of crust , the inner crust and the outer crust , which transport heat not as effectively as the core or quark matter .",
    "the typical thickness of the crust is @xmath44 of the radius , and we can use the parallel - plane approximation to describe the thermal evolution of the inner crust . the thermal history of the inner crust can be described by a heat conduction equation : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the specific heat of the inner crust , @xmath47 is the effective thermal conductivity , and @xmath48 is the neutrino emissivity . as a rule of thumb ,",
    "the effective surface temperature @xmath49 and the temperature at the interface of inner and outer crust , @xmath50 , are related by @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the surface gravity in the unit of @xmath53 cm @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the temperature between the inner and outer crusts in the unit of @xmath56 k , and @xmath57 is the effective surface temperature in the unit of @xmath58 k. the luminosity at the stellar surface , @xmath59 , is equal to the heat flux at the interface of inner and outer crusts : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the radius of the star .",
    "the boundary condition at the interface of the core and inner crust is : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total heat capacity of the core , @xmath64 is the surface area of the core , and @xmath65 is the total neutrino luminosity of the core .      the total heat capacity is the sum of the heat capacities of all species in the star . without the effect of superfluidity , the quark matter can be considered as a free fermi gas , with a specific heat @xcite @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the baryon density in units of @xmath68 and @xmath69 k. in the superfluid state , the specific heat is modified as @xcite : c_q^= 3.15c_q e^-1.76 ,   , where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the energy gap in mev .",
    "it has been argued that for quark matter , even with unequal quark masses , in the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase in which all the three flavors and colors are paired , quark matter is automatically charge neutral and no electrons are required @xcite . however , for sufficiently large strange quark mass and the relatively low density regime near the star surface , the 2 color - flavor superconductor ( 2sc ) phase is preferred .",
    "therefore in a real strange star , electrons should be present .",
    "the contribution of electrons can be parametrized by the electron fraction @xmath73 which depends on the model of strange stars .",
    "we choose @xmath74 as a typical value .",
    "the specific heat capacity of electrons in the strange star is given by @xcite @xmath75 , which is unaffected by the superfluidity of quark matter .",
    "hence it dominates the total heat capacity of the strange star when the temperature drops below @xmath76 .",
    "the total luminosity is the sum of all the energy emission mechanisms , including photon and neutrino emission .",
    "the dominating neutrino emission mechanism is the quark urca process , with emissivity @xcite : _",
    "d2.2 10 ^ 26_s ( ) y_e^1/3t_9 ^ 6 ^-3 ^ -1 , and we have chosen @xmath77 as a constant value throughout the quark star . in the superfluid state ,",
    "the neutrino emissivity is suppressed by a factor of @xmath78 .",
    "it has been pointed out that the bare surface of a strange star is a powerful source of @xmath79 pairs due to the strong surface electric field @xcite .",
    "we adopt the @xmath79 pair luminosity given in @xcite for our calculation .",
    "we also include the thermal equilibrium and non - equilibrium blackbody radiation in our calculation using standard treatment @xcite ; the contribution of the latter is small compared to other mechanisms at high temperature .",
    "once the temperature drops , the cooling is dominated by the relatively low power non - equilibrium blackbody radiation , as long as the star is still in the quark phase .",
    "there are many different models of neutron star cooling .",
    "we adopt the one described by ng @xcite .",
    "the neutrino emission mechanisms are the direct urca processes @xcite , the electron - proton coulomb scattering in the crust @xcite , and the neutrino bremsstrahlung @xcite .",
    "the surface luminosity will be of the blackbody radiation @xmath80 , with the effective surface temperature @xmath81",
    ". the blackbody radiation will be the dominating cooling mechanism after neutrino emissions are switched off .",
    "for the thermal conductivity of the inner crust @xmath47 , we use a temperature dependent model @xcite , @xmath82 .",
    "the choice of @xmath47 will not be important after the epoch of thermal relaxation , which is of the order @xmath83 years .",
    "the temperature of the inner crust and the core will be uniform after that . +",
    "when a strange star is born just after the stellar collapse , its temperature is very high , of the order @xmath84 k  @xcite . @xmath28",
    "mainly affects the conversion energy , which affects the duration of the phase transition .",
    "the cooling mechanisms depend only weakly on @xmath28 while the cooling curves depend weakly on @xmath85 .",
    "we assume @xmath86 mev for our calculations .",
    "we choose a gap value @xmath87 mev @xcite to describe the superfluidity phase of quark matter , and we have checked that using @xmath88 mev gives qualitatively similar results @xcite .",
    "the observables are the luminosity and the surface temperature at infinity , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which are related to the stellar surface values , @xmath91 and @xmath81 @xcite : @xmath92 , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the gravitational redshift at the stellar surface .",
    "the various cooling curves ( solid lines ) for @xmath95 mev are shown in left ( right ) panels of fig .  1 .    for a large range of parameter values and nuclear matter eos s , we obtain a large energy released , of order @xmath0 erg .",
    "the duration of this energy release depends sensitively on @xmath2 ; a higher @xmath2 results in a higher luminosity and shorter phase transition duration .",
    "it can be as short as seconds for @xmath96 mev , or as long as hundred thousands of seconds for @xmath97 mev .",
    "the surface temperature of the star drops rapidly ( top panels of fig .  1 )",
    ", reaching @xmath98  k already within the first second ( @xmath96 mev ) to first hundred thousand seconds ( @xmath97 mev ) .",
    "the decrease in surface temperature is particularly drastic at the completion of the conversion , which is a unique feature of the phase transition not seen in either a pure strange star ( dotted curves ) or a pure neutron star ( dot - dashed curves ) .",
    "the photon luminosity ( middle panels in fig .",
    "1 ) is initially dominated by the @xmath79 pair emission mechanism and is large in the quark phase due to the strong surface electrostatic field .",
    "since the @xmath79 pairs are not affected by the superfluidity gap , the photon luminosity is hardly affected by the gap values .",
    "the total energy radiated by @xmath79 pair emission is @xmath99  erg for @xmath100  mev .",
    "once the phase transition is completed , the surface field of a neutron star is much weaker and this mechanism is turned off .",
    "the photon luminosity therefore drops by over ten orders of magnitudes , and this is more drastic for larger @xmath2 , because the phase transition occurs earlier and with shorter duration .",
    "a distinct second burst of neutrinos shows up in the neutrino luminosity ( bottom panels of fig .  1 ) , which accompanies the completion of the phase transition and arises because of the higher neutrino emissivity in neutron matter .",
    "for @xmath96 mev , the neutrino flux rises by over ten orders of magnitudes within a small fraction of a second .",
    "note that we have not incorporated a detailed transport calculation for the neutrinos , which results in a broadening of the neutrino bursts we present here .",
    "indeed , for @xmath96 mev , the peak neutrino intensity of about @xmath101 ergs@xmath102 lasts only for @xmath103 s , and these neutrinos will be spread out over a diffusion time scale of ( @xmath104 s ) @xcite , reducing the peak intensity by a factor of @xmath105 .",
    "the first and second neutrino peaks are likely rendered indistinguishable by the relatively slow neutrino diffusion out of the dense medium .",
    "a much more careful treatment of the neutrino transport is clearly needed here @xcite . however ,",
    "if @xmath2 is as low as 1 mev , the two bursts of similar flux can be separated by as long as @xmath106  s , which should be observable by modern neutrino observatories .",
    "the two neutrino bursts can in principle be distinquished also by their energy spectra .",
    "the first burst is emitted near the initial high temperature of the newborn strange star , while the second burst is associated with the phase transition temperature @xmath2 , and therefore the second neutrino burst has a softer energy spectrum .",
    "the total energy radiated in neutrino is @xmath107  erg for @xmath100  mev .",
    "this scenario of a second burst of neutrinos can be compared to two previous similar proposals @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the burst is due to the phase transition from a quark star to a neutron star , which has a higher neutrino emissivity , whereas in previous proposals , the second burst accompanies the phase transition from a neutron star to a quark star . in benvenuto s theory , the phase transition is delayed by a few seconds after the core bounce due to the presence of the neutrinos @xcite . in aguilera @xmath7",
    "@xmath108 s theory @xcite , the burst is due to the initial trapping of neutrinos when the temperature is high and their sudden release when the quark star cools .",
    "if quark matter is not as stable as nuclear matter at low temperature , then there should be yet another phase transition back to nuclear matter , which is what we focus on , and the `` second '' neutrino burst we proposed is then the `` third '' neutrino burst",
    ".    if multiple neutrino bursts are observed , as may indeed be the case for the kamiokande data for sn1987a @xcite , whether the compact star changes from the quark phase to neutron phase ( our model ) or the other way around can be distinguished observationally in at least two ways .",
    "first , our model predicts that the cooling is much faster _ before _ the phase transition , but it will become slower _ after _ it .",
    "second , the size of the post - phase - transition compact star , being a normal neutron star , would be larger in our model .",
    "based on the lattice qcd phase diagram , we propose that the new born compact star in a supernova is a strange star and it transforms to a neutron star when it cools down to a critical temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the conversion energy can be of the order @xmath0 erg and is adequate to supply energy for grb s .",
    "the strange star cools rapidly due to neutrino and @xmath79 emission , and its surface temperature drops drastically at the completion of the conversion , when a second neutrino burst emerges due to the higher neutrino emissivity of neutron matter . in our models , the phase transition is treated in a simplified manner .",
