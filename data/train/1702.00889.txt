    "affleck - dine mechanism  @xcite is one of promising candidates for baryogenesis based on supersymmetric ( susy ) theories , where baryon asymmetry is generated by the dynamics in the phase direction of a baryonic scalar field  ( called affleck - dine field ) such as squark .",
    "after the baryon number generation , the spatial inhomogeneities of the affleck - dine field due to quantum fluctuations grows exponentially into non - topological solitons , which are called q - balls  @xcite .",
    "q - ball is defined as a spherical solution in a global @xmath4 theory which minimizes the energy of the system with fixed @xmath4 charge  @xcite .",
    "the baryon number generated in affleck - dine mechanism is confined inside q - balls .",
    "although q - balls are stable against decay into squarks , they may gradually decay into quarks and/or leptons , so that the baryon asymmetry in the universe is generated by quarks emitted from the q - balls .",
    "however , in gauge mediated susy breaking models , a baryonic q - ball can be stable against decay into nucleons  @xcite , while a leptonic q - ball can decay into leptons .",
    "in the previous work  @xcite , we focused on gauge mediation type q - balls that carry both baryon and lepton charges which can be formed after the affleck - dine baryogenesis with @xmath5 flat direction , for instance .",
    "we found that the q - balls can be electrically charged , which are called charged or gauged q - balls  @xcite , and the charged q - balls are stable by virtue of the stability of the baryonic component .",
    "thus , the charged q - ball can be the dark matter in the present universe .",
    "since the charged q - balls capture the charged particles , they form ion - like objects which make different experimental signatures compared to the ordinary neutral q - balls . for instance , q - balls can be detected by super - kamiokande  @xcite or icecube  @xcite , which probe kkst process  @xcite where the q - ball absorbs quarks and emits pions of energy  @xmath6 .",
    "however , the charged q - ball relics experience the ordinary electromagnetic processes as well , so that the detection of those processes is applied .",
    "numerous experiments and upper bounds on the flux of the relics from the charged q - balls are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the most stringent constraint comes from mica experiment  @xcite , where the trail of heavy ion - like object is not observed in @xmath0 years old ancient mica crystals .",
    "since the observation time is equal to the age of the mica , the constraint on q - ball flux is much severer than those coming from other experiments . in the previous work  @xcite",
    ", we found that the mica constraint is more stringent than that from icecube , etc . and",
    "allowed region of the model parameters for gauge mediation type charged q - ball dark matter becomes smaller than the neutral q - ball case .",
    "while the gauge mediation type q - ball is realized when the gauge mediation effect dominates the potential of the affleck - dine field , gravity mediation effect may still dominate over the gauge mediation effect if the field value is sufficiently large . in that case , q - balls with different properties are formed , which we call new - type  ( or hybrid ) q - balls . in this paper , we assume that the new - type q - balls are formed , instead of the gauge mediation type q - balls , after the affleck - dine mechanism , and investigate whether there exists the allowed parameter region for the new - type charged q - ball dark matter .",
    "in specific , we apply the mica constraint on the relics from new - type charged q - balls and find the constraint on gravitino mass  ( susy breaking scale ) and reheating temperature .",
    "in mssm , there are numerous flat directions such as @xmath7 , and @xmath5 , for instance .",
    "we consider dynamics of one of such flat directions in the mssm .",
    "in particular , we consider a flat direction with nonzero baryon and lepton charges , which we call the affleck - dine field . in our universe ,",
    "the supersymmetry is broken , so the flat directions obtain soft susy breaking terms .",
    "we consider the minimal gauge mediation model  @xcite , where susy is spontaneously broken by f - term of a singlet field z : @xmath8 the soft breaking effect is mediated to the visible sector by messenger fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which is a pair of some representations and anti - representations of the minimal gut group @xmath11 , via the following interactions : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote a yukawa constant and messenger mass , respectively .",
    "then , the affleck - dine field obtains the following potential  @xcite by the breaking effect above : @xmath15 the first term comes from gauge mediation effect and gauge mediation parameter @xmath16 is defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 generically denotes the gauge coupling of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "the second term originates from gravity mediation effect and the gravitino mass @xmath19 is given as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "here we assume @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is a constant which comes from the beta function of mass of the ad field and is typically negative , satisfying @xmath24 , and @xmath25 means the renormalization scale .",
    "the third term  ( a - term )  is a @xmath26 and @xmath27 violating term which induces the affleck - dine rotation .    during inflation , the ad field additionally obtain a negative hubble induced mass term @xmath28 due to the coupling to the inflaton , which gives ad field a large vacuum expectation value  ( vev ) .",
    "however , after inflation , the hubble rate becomes smaller than the soft mass and the ad field starts the oscillation around the origin .",
    "then , the spatial inhomogeneities of the ad field , which originate from quantum fluctuations , grow exponentially and form q - balls . as mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "new - type q - ball  @xcite is formed if @xmath29 dominates the potential when the ad field starts the oscillation .",
    "the condition for the @xmath29 domination is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the field value at the beginning of the oscillation .",
    "a typical charge of new - type q - ball can be estimated by a linear approximation or numerical simulations , which is given by  @xcite @xmath33 here @xmath34 , which is a numerical constant .",
    "the profile of the new - type q - ball solution is known to be gaussian as @xmath35 and mass , size and mass per unit charge of new - type q - ball are given by @xmath36 respectively  @xcite .    in the usual scenario ,",
    "the q - ball is assumed to consist only baryonic components such as @xmath7 , but here if we consider the simple two scalar model which consists of baryonic and leptonic components , whose more realistic case is @xmath5 , for example .",
    "then , we can see that the baryonic component is stable against decay since @xmath37 , and only the leptonic component can annihilate into @xmath38 inside q - balls via gaugino and/or higgsino exchange interactions.from this process , electric charge is induced in the q - ball , and from the gauss law , we see that @xmath39 gauge field must have a classical configuration . in the next section ,",
    "we consider the charged , or gauged q - ball  @xcite , which consists of not only the two scalars but also the @xmath4 gauge field .",
    "the lagrangian of our two scalar model is written as @xmath40 and baryon and lepton charges are @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are baryon and lepton number densities .",
    "we assign the positive and negative electric charges for @xmath26 and @xmath44 components , respectively , and thus the total electric charge is given by @xmath45 first , we set an ansatz on the configurations as follows charge , the definition of the q - ball solution . ] : @xmath46    as reviewed in the previous section , there are simple expressions for energy , size , etc . of neutral q - ball ,",
    "but for charged q - ball , the properties become difficult to analyze .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we numerically found , for gauge mediation type q - ball , that the energy per unit charge is written as the neutral q - ball expression plus coulomb potential at the surface of the q - ball if the profile is not deformed very much is very small compared to @xmath26 or @xmath44 , the deformation due to which is also small . ] , as shown in fig .",

    "the energy per unit charge is equal to the energy of a particle emitted from the q - ball through the decay , we can interpret eq .",
    "( [ eq : st ] ) that the energy of a particle emitted from the charged q - ball is written as the energy coming from the residence inside of the q - ball , plus the coulomb potential at the surface .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the fact that the electric charge density mainly distributes at the surface of the q - ball as shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq : sizq ] ) as the surface of the q - ball .",
    "however , from the physical interpretation above , we can specify where the particles will be emitted from , and we can see from fig .",

    "we set @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath50 . ]      here we discuss maximum electric charge to which the q - ball can be charged up by the decay .",
    "first of all , the condition @xmath60 must be satisfied for the decay to occur initially . as electric attraction grows , we expect that the emitted particle becomes bounded to the q - ball , which means the energy of the emitted particle becomes smaller than the rest mass : @xmath61 thus @xmath62 where we used eq .",
    "( [ eq : st ] ) with @xmath48 replaced by @xmath54 , as mentioned in the previous section . as",
    "@xmath58 grows further , the bohr radius becomes smaller , eventually than the q - ball size .",
    "if we naively assume that the particle is absorbed into the q - ball again in that case , the electric charge ceases to grow .",
    "the upper bound on the electric charge can be obtained as follows .",
    "@xmath63 thus @xmath64    another effect which suppresses the growth of the electric charge is schwinger effect , which states that if the electric field becomes large enough  ( @xmath65 ) , pair creation occurs at interval of compton length .",
    "therefore , if the electric field at the surface of the q - ball becomes larger than @xmath66 , the electron produced from pair creation is absorbed into the q - ball , suppressing the growth of the electric charge .",
    "the upper bound on the electric charge in this case is obtained as follows .",
    "@xmath67 thus @xmath68    the above argument applies when the q - ball size is larger than the electron compton length .",
    "if the size of the q - ball is smaller than the compton length , the electric charge can grow further until the electric field at compton length becomes @xmath66 , since the pair creation occurs at interval of compton length , so we obtain @xmath69 thus @xmath70 that is , the fine structure constant inverse  ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "finally , the electric repulsion may make the baryonic component unstable , so we must investigate whether the above upper bounds on the electric charge are still consistent with the stability condition .",
    "the baryonic component becomes unstable when the decay into nucleons becomes kinematically possible , which leads to the following stability condition : @xmath72 thus @xmath73 therefore , the growth of electric charge must stop before it reaches the upper bound given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qm ] , we illustrate the full upper bound on the electric charge of the q - ball , and show that it safely maintain the stability of the baryonic component .",
    ", whose right side is allowed .",
    "we have used @xmath52 . ]",
    "here we discuss the present relics from the new - type charged q - balls and their detections .",
    "we focus on the case that the bohr radius is larger than the q - ball size when maximally charged up , so that we can treat the charged q - ball as ordinary nucleus with extremely heavy mass , which makes the analysis easier .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : qm ] , that this condition is given by @xmath74 and electric charge becomes @xmath75 .",
    "then , the charged q - balls captures the other charged particles like ordinary nucleus , which was already analyzed in ref .",
    "there , we used saha s equation to roughly estimate when the recombination starts , that is , when @xmath76  ( @xmath77 : number density of bound state of a q - ball and an electron ) , and we found that the recombination temperature becomes @xmath78 , if we use , as binding energy , the usual value of nucleus and electron .",
    "similarly , we could find when the recombination finishes , that is , when the charged q - ball completely neutralizes .",
    "since binding energy decreases due to the screening effect of the orbiting electrons for large enough elements , the neutralization temperature necessarily becomes smaller than the usual proton - electron recombination temperature .",
    "therefore , the q - balls do not neutralize , since the free electrons are already captured by protons .",
    "thus , we can conclude that , if charged q - balls with @xmath79 are formed well before the bbn epoch , the present relics become @xmath80 ion - like extremely heavy objects .",
    "these relics must eventually account for dark matter of the universe ,  i.e : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the dark matter energy density and entropy density in the present universe , respectively .",
    "the ion - like relics experience electromagnetic processes .",
    "thus , experiments sensitive to those processes are applicable , and non - detection of the processes gives upper bounds on the amount or flux of the objects .",
    "various upper bounds on the flux of the charged q - ball relics are obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the most stringent comes from mica experiment  @xcite , @xmath84 where they did not observed any trails of heavy ion - like object in @xmath0 years old ancient muscovite mica crystals.the constraint is severe , mainly due to the long detection time , which is essentially the age of the mica .",
    "the other features are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , along with the application on the gauge mediation type q - ball case .",
    "since the q - ball is so heavy that the orbiting particles virtually has no effect on total mass , dark matter flux is given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes dark matter energy density near the solar system , and @xmath87 is the virial velocity of the q - balls .",
    "therefore , using @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we obtain the following constraint on the mass of q - ball : @xmath90 this is a severe constraint , which easily reaches the typical mass of the q - ball , and it constrains @xmath32 via eq .",

    "in gauge mediation models , gravity mediation effect can still dominate over the gauge mediation effect in the scalar potential if the field value is large . in that case , new - type q - balls , which have different properties from gauge mediation type q - balls , are formed after the affleck - dine baryogenesis .",
