    "high - energy neutrinos are ideal cosmic messengers , produced whenever cosmic rays interact with matter or photons near their as - yet unknown acceleration sites , and carrying information about the conditions there to earth without being deflected by magnetic fields or absorbed by intervening matter @xcite . at the same time , neutrinos produced in cosmic - ray air showers provide information about hadronic physics in kinematic regions that are difficult to probe with terrestrial accelerators . here",
    "we present an analysis of the diffuse flux of neutrinos observed from 20102012 via events with vertices contained in the icecube detector @xcite and depositing more than 1  tev of energy .",
    "we derive new constraints on the energy spectrum of the previously - observed @xcite astrophysical neutrino flux as well as the maximum contribution from the decay of charmed mesons in the atmosphere covering significantly lower energies .",
    "this will allow further limits on the possible scenarios @xcite that have been put forward to explain the observed astrophysical flux .",
    "in the first section , we review the sources of neutrinos that can be observed in icecube , the signatures of neutrino interactions , and general methods for separating neutrino events from the extremely large background of penetrating atmospheric muons .",
    "then , we present the veto techniques used to isolate a neutrino - dominated data sample with sensitivity to neutrinos of all flavors coming from all directions and the analysis technique that will be applied to the sample to infer the properties of the underlying neutrino fluxes . finally , we present the results of the search and analysis before discussing the implications of the result and directions for future searches .",
    "neutrinos are an inevitable byproduct of high - energy hadronic interactions that produce weakly - decaying mesons",
    ". they may be produced either within cosmic - ray - induced air showers , giving rise to a flux of atmospheric neutrinos @xcite , or in the vicinity of distant astrophysical accelerators , giving rise to a flux of astrophysical neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the largest contribution to the atmospheric neutrino flux comes from 2-body decays of charged pions and kaons .",
    "these decays produce @xmath3 almost exclusively because of the chiral structure of the weak interaction @xcite .",
    "icecube has observed this flux from the northern sky with high statistics @xcite , and its normalization , angular distribution , and spectral shape agree well with theoretical predictions @xcite . because the decays that produce @xmath3 also produce muons of similar or greater energy , high - energy atmospheric @xmath3 from the southern sky are often accompanied by penetrating muons @xcite .",
    "this is a useful property that can be used to distinguish them from astrophysical neutrinos , which are never accompanied by muons .",
    "the flux of tev atmospheric @xmath4 is much smaller , arising primarily from 3-body decays of @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this flux has also been observed in icecube up to a few tev as an excess of events over the predicted rate from interactions of atmospheric @xmath3 in the more densely - instrumented deepcore subarray @xcite . in the southern sky",
    "these too are often accompanied by muons , though the accompanied fraction is smaller because the muons must come from the decays of other mesons in the air shower @xcite .    a third contribution to the atmospheric neutrino flux observable in icecube",
    "is predicted to come from the decays of heavy , very short - lived mesons containing charm quarks like the @xmath7 .",
    "these decay preferentially to 3-body final states , with nearly equal branching ratios to @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in addition , their prompt decay ( on the order of a picosecond ) makes re - interaction extremely unlikely , so the energy spectrum of neutrinos from charmed meson decay follows that of the cosmic rays up to 50 pev and is independent of the local density of the atmosphere at production altitude @xcite .",
    "this prompt flux has not yet been conclusively observed in either muons or neutrinos , and predictions for the normalization of the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux vary widely @xcite , though more optimistic models @xcite have already been excluded by icecube measurements @xcite .",
    "like neutrinos from light meson decays , neutrinos from charmed meson decay are accompanied by muons . for @xmath3 the accompanied fraction is similar to that in pion and kaon decays .",
    "for @xmath8 it is slightly lower , because charmed meson decays are more likely than kaon decays to produce high - energy neutrinos in relatively low - energy , muon - poor showers @xcite .    while the interactions of cosmic - ray nuclei with the earth s atmosphere are the largest source of high - energy neutrinos , these nuclei must come from some population of sources",
    ". interactions with matter or radiation fields in the vicinity of those sources will produce neutrinos .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration is the most promising mechanism for accelerating protons to the energies observed in the cosmic ray spectrum above the knee ; under fairly general conditions this is expected to produce a flux of protons with a power - law spectrum at the source similar to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "when these protons interact with other protons near the source , they produce charged pions that decay to produce @xmath3 and @xmath10 that in turn decay to produce further @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "long - baseline oscillations will transform this @xmath11 ratio from @xmath12 into approximately @xmath13 at earth @xcite . unless the source environment is very dense",
    ", the energy spectrum of these astrophysical neutrinos follows that of the progenitor protons ( @xmath14 ) , so their flux exceeds that of the atmospheric neutrinos at sufficiently high energies . unlike atmospheric neutrinos , astrophysical",
    "neutrinos always arrive without accompanying muons .",
    "the icecube detector @xcite can detect neutrinos of all flavors by observing the cherenkov photons induced by the charged end products of charged- or neutral - current deep - inelastic neutrino - nucleon scattering in the ice .",
    "the signatures of these interactions fall into two broad categories : `` tracks , '' due to charged - current ( cc ) @xmath3 scattering and `` cascades , '' due to cc interactions of @xmath4 as well as neutral - current ( nc ) interactions of all flavors   interactions also produce a @xmath15 track , the brief lifetime of the @xmath15 makes it too short to be observable on the scale of icecube below a few tens of pev @xcite .",
    "also , if a cc @xmath3 interaction occurs inside the instrumented volume , it will appear more track - like or more cascade - like depending on inelasticity of the interaction and the path of the outgoing muon . ] .",
    "detections of these event signatures and reconstruction of their properties may be used to infer the angular , energy , and flavor distribution of an observed neutrino flux .",
    "roughly @xmath16 of neutrino interactions at a given energy will be neutral - current scatterings , where the neutrino transfers on average @xmath17 of its kinetic energy to a quark in the target nucleus @xcite , producing a short ( @xmath18  m ) shower of relativistic charged particles .",
    "if the neutrino vertex is inside or sufficiently close to the instrumented volume , the cherenkov radiation they induce may be detected and used to reconstruct the vertex position and deposited energy , and to some degree the direction .",
    "the remaining @xmath19 of interactions are charged - current scatterings that produce a charged lepton of the same flavor as the incident neutrino in addition to a hadronic shower . while nearly all of the neutrino s energy is converted to relativistic charged particles , the accuracy with which the direction and energy of the incident neutrino may be reconstructed depends strongly on the lepton flavor .",
    "electrons induce short electromagnetic showers whose energy can be reconstructed to within 10% above 10 tev if fully inside the instrumented volume @xcite .",
    "the direction of the shower may also be inferred by matching the spatial and temporal pattern of detected photons to a template of its angular emission profile , though the short scattering length of the glacial ice at the south pole limits the angular resolution to @xmath20 even above 100 tev  @xcite .",
    "muons lose energy much less quickly , and so can traverse kilometers of ice . while this makes it possible to positively identify @xmath3 cc interactions and reconstruct their direction to within @xmath21  @xcite , it is more difficult to infer the initial neutrino energy when only a segment of the muon track can be observed .",
    "the background to neutrino searches comes from atmospheric muons that penetrate the 1.5 km of ice overburden ; they outnumber neutrino interactions by a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "the traditional method of separating neutrino events from the penetrating muon background is to select only events where a muon comes from below the horizon , where the bulk of the earth completely absorbs atmospheric muons .",
    "while this makes the effective volume of the detector much larger than its geometrical volume , the method is only sensitive to cc @xmath3 interactions and can not be extended much more than @xmath23 above the geometric horizon before penetrating muons begin to overwhelm neutrino - induced ones .",
    "an alternative approach is to select events that start inside the instrumented volume : neutrinos are completely invisible , whereas incoming muons induce cherenkov photons that should be detected as the muon enters the fiducial volume .",
    "such a veto - based event selection can be sensitive to neutrinos of all flavors from all directions , though it must sacrifice some effective volume to implement the veto .",
    "since a muon veto also rejects down - going atmospheric neutrinos that are accompanied by muons , a veto - based event selection also enjoys a smaller atmospheric neutrino background than the traditional up - going neutrino selection @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",

    "active vetoes have been used in icecube to isolate neutrino interactions inside the instrumented volume of the detector before .",
    "the method has been used effectively in the deepcore subarray @xcite and in the full detector above 100 tev @xcite .",
    "however , it has not been explored in the region between 10 and 100 tev , where neutrinos from charmed meson decay in the atmosphere should be observable . extending veto methods to this intermediate energy range without sacrificing sensitivity to all neutrino flavors or to neutrinos from the southern sky",
    "requires new techniques .",
    "figure  [ fig : cut_progression ] illustrates the effects of the three stages of the event selection that will be described in this section : a pre - selection cut to reduce the data rate to a manageable level , veto cuts to remove events with signs of incoming muons , and a fiducial volume cut to remove events where incoming muons can not be vetoed with sufficiently high probability .",
    "the icecube detector @xcite consists of 5160 digital optical modules ( doms ) buried in the glacial ice at the south pole , instrumenting a total volume of approximately 1  km@xmath27 .",
    "the doms are attached to cables that provide power and communication with the data acquisition system on the surface of the glacier .",
    "each of these `` strings '' hosts 60 doms ; 78 of the strings are spaced 125 m apart on a hexagonal grid with doms placed every 17 m from 1450 to 2450 m below the surface , while the remaining 8 strings form the deepcore in - fill array @xcite .",
    "these in - fill strings are 3060 m from the nearest string with 50 doms placed every 7 m between 2100 and 2450 m below the surface , where the glacial ice is most transparent , and 10 doms placed every 10 m between 1750 and 1850 m below the surface .",
    "the data that will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] were taken with the nearly - complete 79-string detector configuration from may 2010 to may 2011 and the first year of the complete 86-string detector from may 2011 to may 2012 .",
    "each dom consists of a 25 cm diameter photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) @xcite , power supply , and digitization electronics housed in a borosilicate glass pressure sphere .",
    "the pmt signal is digitized and stored for transmission to the surface whenever the pmt output current exceeds 1/4 of the mean peak current of the pulse amplified from a single photo - electron ( pe ) ; if a neighboring or next - to - neighboring dom on the same string also triggers within 1 @xmath10s ( local coincidence ) the readout extends for 6.4 @xmath10s , otherwise the readout only includes a 75 ns window around the peak current in the first 400 ns after the local trigger .",
    "the digitized waveforms are transmitted to the surface , where they are assembled into events by a software trigger @xcite .",
    "the arrival times of individual photons and photon bunches are reconstructed by deconvolving the characteristic single - pe pulse shape from the digitized waveforms @xcite , and the resulting times and photon counts are used to reconstruct the vertices , directions , and energies @xcite of the relativistic charged particles that induced the detected cherenkov photons .",
    "the first stage of the event selection is done at the south pole to reduce the data rate enough for transmission over a satellite link ; the resulting sample , shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cut_progression ] , includes @xmath28% of all triggering events . while this selection retains the majority of triggering neutrino events ,",
    "they are still out - numbered 10,000 to 1 by penetrating muons .",
    "the remaining selection steps remove this background , leaving a nearly - pure sample of neutrino events .      this selection targets interactions of isolated neutrinos that occur inside the instrumented volume , producing a cascade at the neutrino vertex as well as an out - going track in the case of cc @xmath3",
    ". these can be distinguished from incoming muons ( and atmospheric neutrinos accompanied by muons ) by photons detected before the putative neutrino vertex .",
    "the simplest approach is the one employed in @xcite , where the outermost layer of pmts is used as an active veto .",
    "the event is rejected if photons are detected on the outermost layer before the estimated vertex time .",
    "spurious vetoes due to detector noise are mitigated by requiring that the photons are detected in local coincidence @xcite at times that are causally compatible with the estimated vertex .",
    "for very bright events with thousands of detected photons , this single cut is sufficient to suppress the muon background below the level of atmospheric neutrinos ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cut_progression ] , center panel ) .",
    "as the energy threshold is lowered , the number of background muons increases rapidly , while their average energy loss rate decreases , a combination that overwhelms the ability of the single layer to reject incoming muons . in order to extend the selection to lower energies ,",
    "a second kind of veto , similar to those employed in @xcite , is required .",
    "the first modification is to remove the requirements that veto photons be detected on the outermost layer of pmts and in local coincidence .",
    "this allows isolated photon detections anywhere in the instrumented volume to veto an incoming track , which lowers the energy threshold but also loses signal events to spurious vetoes caused by noise .",
    "in order to mitigate the signal loss , a second modification is required : photons are only considered for veto if they are detected at a time and position consistent with an incoming track but inconsistent with the reconstructed cascade vertex , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : veto_sketch : incoming_before ] .",
    "the most resilient background comes from single muons with a single disproportionately large stochastic energy loss .",
    "such events can be completely dominated by the photons induced by the largest energy loss , causing track reconstruction algorithms that assume uniform light emission to fail to find the correct direction .",
    "the position and time of the vertex can , however , be reconstructed reliably regardless of the presence of a muon track . in order to ensure that veto photons will be found , the search is repeated for each of 104 different down - going track hypotheses that pass through the reconstructed vertex .",
    "the track hypothesis with the largest number of associated veto photons is considered the best .",
    "a photon is associated with an incoming track if it is detected    * at least 50 ns before the earliest possible time for a photon induced at the previously reconstructed vertex , * between 15 ns before and 1000 ns after the earliest possible time for a photon induced by the hypothetical muon , * and no more than 100 m from the hypothetical muon trajectory .",
    "the event is rejected if the best track has more than two associated photons .",
    "since the effectiveness of the track - based veto is proportional to the probability of detecting at least 2 photons from an incoming muon before the reconstructed vertex , it increases in proportion to the number of detectable photons the muon induces and the number of pmts it passes on its way to the vertex as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : veto_passing_rate_l2 ] .",
    "this relationship can be exploited to maintain sufficient penetrating muon rejection at low energies by requiring a minimum distance between the reconstructed vertex and the edges of the instrumented volume that increases as the number of collected photons decreases as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : volume_scaling ] . at the lowest photon counts the fiducial volume",
    "is reduced to the deepcore subarray with the remainder of the detector used as a veto ; as the photon count increases the veto reduces to the outermost layer of pmts as in @xcite .",
    "this selection creates the neutrino - dominated sample shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : cut_progression ] .",

    "the outer - layer veto reduces the rate of the highest - energy muons by @xmath29 , but degrades rapidly at lower energies .",
    "the incoming - track veto scales in a similar way with respect to energy , but is more sensitive because it considers isolated photon detections .",
    "in contrast to the outer - layer veto , its efficiency also improves with increasing distance @xmath30 from the detector border of the reconstructed vertex . ]",
    "the events that pass the selection defined above arise from four sources : conventional atmospheric neutrinos , prompt atmospheric neutrinos , penetrating atmospheric muons , and high - energy extraterrestrial neutrinos .",
    "each of these components produces a distinct distribution in the observables chosen for this analysis : reconstructed deposited energy , reconstructed zenith angle , and the presence or absence of a detectable outgoing muon track .",
    "we disentangle the contributions of each of these components by fitting a model of their observable distributions predicted from monte carlo simulation to the observed data . in this section",
    "we define the observables and discuss their expected distributions for each component .",
    "then , we present the likelihood fitting technique and the method for determining statistical errors on the fit parameters .    the deposited energy is reconstructed by fitting the observed spatial and temporal distribution of detected photons to a template derived from simulations of single , point - like electromagnetic cascades as described in @xcite .",
    "this electromagnetic - equivalent energy can be resolved to within 10% ( 68% c.l . ) and is a proxy for the neutrino energy ; for cc @xmath8 it is a nearly unbiased estimator of the neutrino energy @xcite , while for all other interaction types it is on average proportional to the neutrino energy . since the template depends on the orientation of the cascade with respect to the dom , the same technique yields a direction as well , with a typical zenith angle resolution of 15(68% c.l . ) in the sample presented here .",

    "astrophysical ) spectrum are mis - classified as tracks . for track - like events",
    "the zenith angle is taken from the best - fit outgoing track , as the large displacement of the associated photons from the neutrino interaction vertex provides a better constraint than the initial cascade . explicitly retaining these track - like events , rather than rejecting them with cuts designed to select cascade events , provides a built - in control sample that we use to check our understanding of the selection s neutrino acceptance .",
    "conventional atmospheric neutrinos are produced in the decays of charged pions and charged and neutral kaons in the atmosphere . since these mesons are relatively long - lived , they are more likely to re - interact and lose energy than to decay to produce neutrinos .",
    "this competition affects both the deposited energy and the zenith angle distributions .",
    "the neutrino energy spectrum above 1 tev is one power in energy steeper than that of the input cosmic ray spectrum , causing the deposited energy distribution to peak at low energies .",
    "the flux is largest at the horizon where the average density of the atmosphere along the air shower axis is smallest @xcite , causing the reconstructed zenith angle distribution to peak at the horizon as well . in the southern sky",
    "these effects are further enhanced by accompanying muons produced in the same air shower : they trigger the veto , removing high - energy , down - going atmospheric neutrino events from the sample @xcite .",

    "is taken from a parametrization of the calculation of @xcite , corrected to account for the cosmic ray flux of @xcite as described in @xcite and for the fraction of atmospheric neutrinos that are vetoed @xcite by accompanying muons .",

    "the lifetimes of charmed mesons are extremely short , so they nearly always decay promptly before re - interacting , producing an isotropic neutrino flux with nearly the same spectral index as that of the primary cosmic rays .",
    "since neutrinos with accompanying muons are vetoed in the event selection , the observable flux is depleted in the southern sky .",

    "the events that pass the final selection include a small but nearly irreducible background of penetrating atmospheric muons that go undetected before depositing a large fraction of their energy in the glacial ice in a single , catastrophic loss .",

    "as pointed out in @xcite , @xmath55 interactions produce neutrinos and @xmath38-rays that follow the same scale - free power - law spectrum , and the @xmath38 spectra from @xmath55 interactions at @xmath56gev energies can be extrapolated to the tev range where icecube observes neutrinos .",
    "this extrapolation argument does not apply to @xmath57 interactions .",
    "if the diffuse extragalactic @xmath38 background measured by fermi - lat is due to extragalactic @xmath55 interactions in optically thin regions , then the spectral index of the associated neutrino spectrum must be smaller than 2.2 .",
    "the data presented here indicate that the neutrino spectrum is softer than @xmath58 with 90% confidence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : profile2d : index_astro ] ) , implying that one of these assumptions is violated .",
    "all of the parameters in tab .",
    "[ tab : bestfit ] are correlated except for the conventional atmospheric neutrino flux normalization .",
    "the latter is determined mostly by the northern - sky data below 10  tev deposited energy , where the contributions of the other components are negligible , and is compatible with the expected normalization @xcite to within statistical errors , providing a useful check of the neutrino acceptance calculated from simulation .",
    "similarly , the low - energy component provides a verification of the atmospheric neutrino veto independent of the observed astrophysical excess , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zenith-3tev ] .",
    "the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux , on the other hand , can provide a significant contribution to the overall event rate between 10 and 100 tev deposited energy , but has no region where it contributes exclusively .",
    "its inferred normalization depends on assumptions about the astrophysical neutrino flux .",
    "the correlations between the astrophysical and prompt atmospheric components are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile2d ] . since the power - law index of the astrophysical flux is constrained primarily by the large number of events below the pivot point at 100  tev , the normalization and index are correlated .",
    "similarly , the prompt normalization is correlated with the astrophysical index ; as the index is forced to smaller values , a larger prompt flux is required to explain the data between 10 and 100 tev deposited energy .",
    "the normalization of the penetrating muon component is constrained by the excess of southern - sky data over the conventional atmospheric neutrino expectation below a few tev , and is weakly correlated with it ( not shown ) .    .",
    "these match the observed data much better than the the dotted line , which shows the number of events that would be collected if atmospheric neutrinos were never vetoed by accompanying muons . ]",
    "these correlations would not be problematic if the model of the astrophysical flux were exact , but since its sources are not known , any single model will necessarily be an approximation .",
    "it is useful to examine how assumptions about astrophysical models affect the upper limit on the prompt atmospheric flux normalization .",
    "the first assumption made is that the astrophysical flux must follow a single power - law energy distribution .",
    "this assumption can be relaxed by describing the astrophysical neutrino flux with a piecewise constant function of neutrino energy as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : unfolding ] .",
    "the observed excess in the deposited energy spectrum is reflected in a corresponding excess in the neutrino energy spectrum , and the additional freedom granted to the astrophysical component weakens the 90% upper limit on the prompt atmospheric flux from 1.52 to 1.75 times the prediction of @xcite .",
    "this remaining limit is driven primarily by the assumption that the astrophysical neutrino flux is isotropic .",
    "if this assumption is weakened by allowing the astrophysical fluxes that contribute to the northern- and southern - sky data to vary independently , the limit relaxes further to 3.69 . while this limit is not meaningfully smaller than the previously published limit of 3.8 @xcite , it involves many fewer assumptions about the nature of the astrophysical neutrino background .    .",
    "the horizontal error bars show the range of primary neutrino energies that contribute to each bin , while the vertical error bars show the range of @xmath59 that change the @xmath60 test statistic by less than 1 .",
    "the black points show the fit to the data sample presented here ; the light grey data points are from the 3-year data sample of @xcite , shifted slightly to the right for better visibility . above the highest observed energy ,",
    "the error bars provide upper limits on the flux ; these are less constraining than the upper limits of @xcite above 10 pev .",
    "the thin lines show models for the diffuse astrophysical neutrino background : the upper bound from the total luminosity of eev cosmic rays from @xcite ( blue ) , the starburst galaxy model of @xcite ( green ) , and the agn core emission model of @xcite ( purple ) . ]",
    "in the analysis presented here , we used a veto - based technique to isolate 388 events starting in the icecube instrumented volume and depositing more than 1 tev from 641 days of data , of which 92% were neutrino events .",
    "astrophysical neutrino candidates were observed in the southern sky with energies as low as 10 tev , far below the threshold of the previous high - energy starting event analysis @xcite and in a region inaccessible to the traditional up - going track analysis @xcite .",
    "we characterized the contributions of penetrating atmospheric muons , conventional and prompt atmospheric neutrinos , and astrophysical neutrinos to the data sample using a likelihood fit to the distributions of deposited energy and zenith angle for cascade and starting - track events .",
    "the analysis yielded new information about the behavior of the neutrino spectrum between 10 and 100 tev .",
    "if the energy spectrum of the astrophysical neutrinos is a single power law , then it must have a spectral index of @xmath61 , softer than the typical @xmath26 benchmark spectrum .",
    "the @xmath62 hypothesis can be rejected with 99% confidence under this assumption .",
    "the new constraint on the spectral index is due primarily to the lower deposited - energy threshold of this analysis .",
    "if the deposited - energy threshold is raised to 60 tev ( corresponding to sensitivity for @xmath63 ) , then the best - fit spectral index hardens to @xmath64 , compatible with the previous high - energy result @xcite .",
    "the statistically insignificant excess that appeared in the down - going data near 30 tev , a region where atmospheric leptons are heavily suppressed , had only a minor influence on the inferred spectral index of the astrophysical neutrinos .",
    "if we force the spectral index to @xmath62 , then the per - flavor normalization @xmath50 ( cf .",
    ") drops to @xmath65 , consistent with the previously published 90% c.l .",
    "upper limit of 1.44 derived from northern - sky @xmath3 events @xcite . at the same time , we searched for atmospheric neutrinos from charmed meson decay .",
    "no such component was observed , and we placed upper limits on their flux .",
    "these limits depend strongly on assumptions about the astrophysical neutrino background , and range from 1.52 times the prediction from perturbative qcd @xcite at 90% confidence when the astrophysical flux is assumed to follow a single isotropic power - law distribution to 3.69 times the prediction when it is described with a piecewise constant function of energy and zenith angle .",
    "the constraints on the astrophysical flux are currently limited by the small number of observed high - energy events , making it difficult to draw strong inferences about the classes of cosmic - ray accelerators from the characteristics of the associated neutrino spectrum . beyond astrophysical considerations ,",
    "the inability to model the astrophysical flux precisely and reliably extrapolate its angular and energy distribution to lower energies impedes any attempt to measure the level of charmed - meson production in air showers via high - energy neutrinos .",
    "both of these problems may be approached with more and different data .",
    "icecube will continue to collect data , and future iterations of this analysis will be able to use at least twice as many high - energy neutrino events to constrain the energy spectrum and eventually possible anisotropies of the astrophysical neutrino flux .",
    "in addition to better modeling of the astrophysical background , sensitivity to charmed meson production in the atmosphere will be improved by analyzing penetrating muon events jointly with neutrino events .",
    "these are produced in the same decays as prompt muon neutrinos , but have no astrophysical background to contend with .",
