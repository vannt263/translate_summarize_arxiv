    "heavy ion collisions have received significant attention in recent years . electromagnetic probes ( photons , dileptons etc )",
    "have been proposed to be one of the most promising tools to characterize the initial state of the collisions  @xcite . because of the very nature of their interactions with the constituents of the system they tend to leave the system almost unscattered .",
    "photons are produced at various stages of the evolution process .",
    "the initial hard scatterings ( compton and annihilation ) of partons lead to photon production which we call hard photons .",
    "if quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is produced initially , there are qgp - photons from thermal compton plus annihilation processes .",
    "photons are also produced from different hadronic reactions from hadronic matter either formed initially ( no qgp scenario ) or realized as a result of a phase transition from qgp .",
    "these apart , there exits another class of photon emission process via the jet conversion mechanism ( jet - plasma interaction )  @xcite which occurs when a high energy jet interacts with the medium constituents via annihilation and compton processes .    in current heavy ion collision experiments ,",
    "the temperature @xmath1 is not only the important scale , momentum scale , @xmath2 , ( of the partons ) is also important .",
    "therefore running of the coupling in the high momentum regime ( @xmath3 ) has to be taken into account to calculate the cross sections and the energy - loss processes . in this work",
    "we calculate photons from jet - plasma interaction taking into account running of qcd coupling and both collisional and radiative energy losses .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows .",
    "we discuss the formalism in the next section .",
    "results will be discussed in the section 3 .",
    "finally we will conclude .",
    "the lowest order processes for photon emission from qgp are the compton scattering ( @xmath4 ) and annihilation ( @xmath5 ) process .",
    "the differential photon production rate for this process is given by  @xcite : @xmath6 where , @xmath7 represents the spin averaged matrix element squared for one of those processes which contributes in the photon rate and @xmath8 is the degeneracy factor of the corresponding process .",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the initial state and final state partons . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distribution functions .",
    "in the photon production rate ( from jet - plasma interaction ) one of the collision partners is assumed to be in equilibrium and the other ( the jet ) is executing random motion in the heat bath provided by quarks ( anti - quarks ) and gluons . furthermore , the interaction of the jet is dominated by small angle scattering . in such scenario the evolution of the jet phase space distribution",
    "is governed by fokker - planck ( fp ) equation where the collision integral is approximated by appropriately defined drag ( @xmath12 ) and diffusion coefficients  @xcite .",
    "the drag and diffusion coefficients are infrared singular .",
    "the infra - red cut - off is fixed by plasma effects , where only the medium part is considered , completely neglecting the vacuum contribution leading to ambiguity in the energy loss calculation . if the latter part is taken into account the strong coupling should be running .",
    "thus for any consistent calculation one has to take into consideration this fact . in that case @xmath13 ( @xmath14 in this case ) , and the above integrals must be evaluated numerically where the infra - red cut - off is fixed by debye mass to be solved self - consistently : @xmath15 here the strong coupling which we take as running , i. e. @xmath16 .",
    "we chose the following parametrization of @xmath0 which respects the perturbative ultra - violet ( uv ) behavior and the 3d infra - red ( ir ) point  @xcite : @xmath17 with @xmath18 in this case .",
    "the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are given by @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 gev .",
    "for the limiting behavior ( @xmath25 ) of the coupling we choose , @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the values of the ir fixed point of @xmath29 yang - mills theory in @xmath30 and @xmath31 dimensions , respectively .",
    "the remaining four parameters ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) fit the numerical results for pure yang - mills theory obtained from the rg equations in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our calculation",
    "we have considered both collisional and radiative energy losses in the following manner .",
    "@xmath34\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for running @xmath0 , the expressions for the collisional and radiative energy losses can be found in @xcite .",
    "having known the drag and diffusion , we solve the fp equation using green s function techniques ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .      in order to obtain the space - time integrated rate we first note that the phase space distribution function for the incoming jet in the mid rapidity region is given by",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) @xmath35 with this jet parton phase space distribution function one can easily obtain jet photon yield from eqn .",
    "( 1 ) : @xmath36",
    "in order to obtain the photon @xmath37 distribution we numerically integrate eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) .",
    "the results for jet - photons for rhic energies are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_rhic446 ] ( left ) where we have taken @xmath38 mev and @xmath39 fm / c .",
    "we find that the yield is decreased with the inclusion of both the energy loss mechanisms as compared to the case when only collisional energy loss is considered .",
    "it is to be noted that when one considers collisional energy loss alone the yield with constant @xmath0 is more compared to the situation when running @xmath0 is taken into account ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_rhic446 ] left ) .    in order to compare our results with high @xmath37 photon data measured by the phenix collaboration  @xcite",
    ", we have to evaluate the contributions to the photons from other sources , that might contribute in this @xmath37 range . in fig .  [ fig_rhic446 ] ( right )",
    "the results for jet - photons corresponding to the rhic energies are shown , where we have taken @xmath38 mev and @xmath39 fm / c .",
    "the individual contributions from hard and bremsstrahlung processes  @xcite are also shown for comparison .",
    "we have calculated the transverse momentum distribution of photons from jet plasma interaction with running coupling , i. e. with @xmath40 where we have included both collisional and radiative energy losses .",
    "using running coupling we find that the depletion in the photon @xmath37 spectra is by a factor of @xmath41 more as compared to the case with constant coupling for rhic energies phenix photon data have been contrasted with the present calculation and the data seem to have been reproduced well in the low @xmath37 domain .",
    "the energy of the jet quark to produce photons in this range ( @xmath42 ) is such that collisional energy loss plays important role here .",
    "it is shown that inclusion of radiative energy loss also describes the data reasonable well ."
