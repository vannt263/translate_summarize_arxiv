    "the purpose of this article is to review several results linked to a concept which has been very influential in the work of markus bttiker , namely the concept of wigner time delay , and several of its extensions ",
    "traversal time , wigner - smith matrix , injectance , etc . in my opinion , this topic allows one to have a good flavor of markus bttiker s style as a physicist  : a combination between formal developments with mathematical elegance and motivations from pratical questions of fundamental condensed matter physics . besides",
    ", the choice of this theme is also related to a more personal anecdote as it was the subject of my first scientific exchange with markus bttiker , which i rediscovered during the preparation of this article , finding in a box a copy of an old email , dated the 8th july 1997 , addressed to me and my phd advisor alain comtet . here are few sentences extracted from this message  : `` _ i noticed yesterday your paper on the cond - mat network @xcite .",
    "i like to react to two things : ( ... ) in your introduction you jump from the work of fyodorov and sommers immediatly to the work of brouwer _",

    "_ as they make clear in very strong terms takes its starting point from my work by gopar and mello @xcite , and that alone should have been a good enough reason to not simply leave it out .",
    "( ... ) therefore , it is my hope that you can give this work the place it deserves . sincerely , markus bttiker _ '' . of course , he was absolutely right and we soon after amended our paper according to his remarks . despite this",
    "somewhat awkward beginning , markus bttiker hired me as a postdoctoral assistant at the university of geneva two years later and i enjoyed very much the pleasant and stimulating atmosphere of the physics department .",
    "i especially appreciated the freedom which markus gave to his postdocs and learnt a lot from our regular exchanges .    _",

    "the purpose of the present article is to review few results on time delays from different contexts and to emphasize the diversity of the physical situations where this concept has found some applications .",

    "the most simple situation allowing to introduce the concept of time delay is the scattering problem on the half line ( this also corresponds to project a rotational invariant problem in an orbital momentum channel , in higher dimensions ) .",

    "[ subsec : characteristictimes ] ) and diagonalise it , we get the proper time delays @xmath271 and @xmath272 .",
