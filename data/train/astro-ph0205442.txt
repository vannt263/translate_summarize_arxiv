    "the nature of the persistent high - energy ( @xmath12 mev ) @xmath0-ray sources in the galaxy remains a puzzle three decades after their discovery . ever since the identification of the mysterious @xmath0-ray source geminga as the first radio quiet but otherwise ordinary pulsar ( see review by bignami & caraveo 1996 ) , it has been argued that rotation - powered pulsars likely dominate the galactic @xmath0-ray source population ( e.g. , halpern & ruderman 1993 ; helfand 1994 ; kaaret & cottam 1996 ; yadigaroglu & romani 1997 ) , and that many of them are radio quiet . that geminga is a bright egret source at a distance of only @xmath13  pc ( halpern & ruderman 1993 ; caraveo et al .",
    "1996 ) begs for it not to be unique .    as a @xmath0-ray pulsar spins down , an increasing fraction of its power",
    "is emitted above 100  mev ( thompson et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "this implies that the @xmath0-ray source population is not necessarily dominated by _",
    "young _ pulsars . like geminga and psr  b105552",
    ", many of them could be quite old , up to @xmath14  yr or more .",
    "geminga itself has a characteristic age of @xmath15  yr , and the egret pulsar psr  b105552 is @xmath16  yr old .",
    "the unidentified @xmath0-ray sources may therefore include a significant fraction of the nearby neutron - star population that has yet to be accounted for , and may provide a useful window into their physics .",
    "it is also speculated ( gehrels et al .",
    "2000 ; grenier 2000 ; harding & zhang 2001 ) that as many as 40 of the steady , unidentified egret sources at intermediate galactic latitude are a population of older pulsars born in the gould belt , an inclined , expanding disk of star formation in the solar neighborhood that is @xmath17  yr old .",
    "if so , they will most easily be identified as soft blackbody x - ray sources without optical counterparts .    as the brightest of the as - yet unidentified high - latitude egret sources ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , at @xmath18 ,  is a good a priori target for the next such identification , and a candidate for the prototype of the putative gould belt pulsars .",
    "mirabal et al .",
    "( 2000 , hereafter paper i ) performed an exhaustive , multiwavelength search for a counterpart of .",
    "they identified optically all but one of the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ sources in the region of to a flux limit of @xmath19  ergs  @xmath20  s@xmath21 , which is @xmath22 of the @xmath0-ray flux , without finding a plausible counterpart among the identified sources .",
    "mirabal & halpern ( 2001 , hereafter paper ii ) concluded that the one optically undetected x - ray source ,  ( also the brightest one in the egret error circle ) , is the most promising candidate for identification with  principally because of the absence of optical emission . the upper limit ( at that time ) on the optical flux from  implied that its ratio of x - ray - to - optical flux @xmath23 is greater than 300 , an extreme that is seen only among neutron stars .",
    "the detection of  as a weak , ultrasoft source in the  all - sky survey ( paper ii ) , further suggested that it is a thermally emitting neutron star that is either older or more distant than geminga .",
    "we designed follow - up observations with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) to test this hypothesis and to further characterize the properties of the presumed neutron star .",
    "we also re - examined its location for evidence of a radio pulsar .",
    "previous searches of the  error box failed to find a radio pulsar to a limit of 1  mjy at 770  mhz ( nice & sayer 1997 ) , and radio continuum observations of the entire error box using the vla at 1420  mhz yielded an upper limit of 0.5  mjy at the location of  ( paper i ) .",
    "these limits are not below the range of several radio pulsar detections , so we performed deeper searches at jodrell bank to improve upon them .",
    "a _ chandra _ observation with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; burke et al .",
    "1997 ) was made on 2002 march 6 .",
    "the target source  was positioned at the default position on the back - illuminated s3 chip of the acis - s array .",
    "the total usable exposure time was 28,117  s. figure  1 shows a smoothed version of the image .",
    "a total of 260 counts were extracted from a @xmath24 radius circle centered on  using the ciao `` psextract '' script .",
    "a spectral file was produced by grouping at least 20 counts per channel .",
    "instrument and mirror response files were generated using the ciao tools `` makermf '' and `` makearf '' .",
    "the expected contribution of background to the source spectrum is only @xmath25 counts , so no background subtraction was performed .",
    "there is no evidence for extended emission ( synchrotron nebulosity ) associated with this source .",
    "figure  2 shows the grouped acis spectrum , which is clearly that of an ultrasoft source , as first revealed by the _",
    "rosat _ all - sky survey ( paper ii ) .",
    "the fact that the counts are rising down to the lowest energy signifies both a soft intrinsic spectrum and little absorbing column . although the acis response below 0.6 kev may not be well calibrated ( e.g. , zavlin et al .",
    "2002 ) , we do not have the freedom to exclude these energies from spectral fitting because they contain the majority of our photons .",
    "instead , we proceed with the following analysis based on the current calibration .",
    "first , we ignore the spectral channel around 0.28  kev , since a deviant point there may be associated with poor instrumental calibration around the carbon k - edge .",
    "next , attempts to fit the spectrum using a blackbody or power - law model alone produced unsatisfactory fits , with @xmath26/dof = 10 and 4 , respectively .",
    "this result is insensitive to @xmath27 , whether the latter is treated as a free parameter or held fixed at the maximum galactic value in this direction ( @xmath28  @xmath20 ) . a two - component model consisting of a blackbody plus a power law produced adequate fits , with reduced @xmath29 for all values of @xmath30  @xmath20 .",
    "however , the small number of photons , extremely soft spectrum , and unknown intervening column density render the blackbody flux and bolometric luminosity highly uncertain even if the instrument response were known accurately . rather than leaving @xmath27 a free parameter in the fits , we explore the effects of assuming particular values of @xmath27 ranging from @xmath31  @xmath20 to the maximum galactic value of @xmath28  @xmath20 .",
    "figure  3 shows the corresponding confidence contours .",
    "the best fitted blackbody temperatures for this range of @xmath27 vary from @xmath32  k , with a @xmath33 upper limit of @xmath34  k. the high - energy tail that is required to accompany the blackbody component is parameterized as a power - law of photon index @xmath35 ( @xmath33 limits ) , with flux in the @xmath36  kev band of @xmath37 ergs  @xmath20  s@xmath21 .",
    "we bound the range of plausible distances by assuming a blackbody radius of 10  km for each of the trial values of @xmath27 . under this assumption ,",
    "@xmath38  pc , and @xmath39 ergs  s@xmath21 ; smaller distance corresponds to smaller temperature .",
    "formally , no lower limit on @xmath40 can be set from the x - ray spectrum alone , although the distance would become unreasonably small for @xmath41  k given the lack of optical detection , which sets an additional lower bound on @xmath42 ( see  3 ) .",
    "precise astrometry of the acis image in the usno - a2.0 optical reference frame was achieved by registration of four previously identified , `` bright '' x - ray sources in figure  1 with their optical counterparts on the mdm 2.4 m @xmath43-band ccd image described in papers i and ii . this required a zero - point shift to the _ chandra _ aspect solution of @xmath44 in right ascension and @xmath45 in declination , which is within specifications .",
    "the corrected position of  is ( j2000 ) @xmath46 , which should be accurate to @xmath47 relative to our ground - based optical image as indicated by the residual dispersion in x - ray - optical offsets of the identified sources .",
    "we note that this position is only @xmath48 from the _ rosat _ hri position that was determined in a similar manner in paper ii , confirming that the latter s error circle radius of @xmath49 was conservative .",
    "the agreement in position between these two x - ray observations that were made 4 years apart already limits any proper motion of the source to @xmath50 yr@xmath21 .",

    "deep images were obtained on 2002 february 2 using the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) ccd on _ hst _ , both with open filter ( 50ccd ) and long - pass filter ( f28x50lp ) . in each filter , a total exposure time of 10,400  s was obtained in a standard parallelogram dither pattern with four exposures at    fig . 3. confidence contours for the two - component fit ( @xmath52 ) to the _ chandra _ spectrum of .",
    "the intervening column density has been held fixed at two different values , the maximum galactic value being @xmath53 @xmath20 .",
    "confidence levels are for two interesting parameters .",
    "each point to facilitate the rejection of cosmic rays .",
    "the data were processed using the standard stis pipeline , registered , and combined according to the dither pattern .",
    "figure  4 shows a portion of the resulting open filter image centered on .",
    "aperture photometry was used to obtain stis magnitudes from the photlam and photzpt keywords in the image headers .",
    "we then adopted the transformation equations derived by rejkuba et al .",
    "( 2000 ) from observations of stars in the irregular galaxy wlm to convert stis magnitudes in the open and long - pass filters to the @xmath43 and @xmath54 kron - cousins system .",
    "we also examined a set of objects in the stis images that we had previously calibrated in ground - based photometry , and the zero - points agree .",
    "thus , we find that the limiting magnitudes for point - source detection at the @xmath55 level are @xmath56 from the 50ccd image and and @xmath57 from the f28x50lp",
    ". the main uncertainty in this calibration is due to the broad passbands of the stis filters , and is estimated as 0.2 mag .    in order to tie the _",
    "hst _ and _ chandra _ images to the same astrometric reference frame , we used the positions of 10 objects that are present on the both the _ hst _ stis and ground - based ccd images to transfer the usno - a2.0 reference frame to the stis image .",
    "these objects include stars and compact galaxies .",
    "the dispersion among these 10 secondary astrometric standards from the fit to their _ hst _ positions is @xmath58 , or slightly larger than 1 stis pixel .",
    "thus , the combined uncertainty in _ chandra _ and _ hst _ astrometry is less than @xmath59 ; we use a conservative error circle of radius @xmath59 in figure  4 to indicate the location of the x - ray source on the stis image .",
    "since the _ hst _ and _ chandra _ observations were made only one month apart , we are confident that any proper motion , already limited to @xmath50 yr@xmath21 , is of no importance .    the _ chandra _ error circle excludes all of the optical objects within the _ rosat _ error circle that were detected by totani , kawasaki , & kawai ( 2002 ) in their @xmath60-band image obtained on the subaru telescope . at the northeast edge of the _ chandra _ error circle",
    "there is only a marginal source of @xmath61 in the stis 50ccd image , but it is not present in the f28x50lp image . since this is not even a @xmath55 detection , we consider that the x - ray source is formally undetected optically , with upper limits of @xmath5 and @xmath62 , and that it must therefore be a neutron star with @xmath6 . the absence of an optical detection places additional constraints on the distance and temperature of the neutron star",
    "a magnitude limit of @xmath5 corresponds to a flux @xmath63jy at a wavelength of 5500  , whereas the rayleigh - jeans flux from a neutron star at that wavelength would be @xmath64jy , where @xmath65 is @xmath40 in units of @xmath66  k , @xmath67 is the radius in units of 10  km , and @xmath68 is the distance in units of 100  pc .",
    "therefore , the nominal x - ray fitted temperature of @xmath69  k , if coming from the full surface of the neutron star , would require @xmath7  pc .",
    "the absence of a `` strong , '' i.e , @xmath70 mjy radio source at the position of  was already known from paper i. in order to make a more sensitive search for radio pulsations , we obtained six observations on different days in 2001 february and march for 2.3  hr each with the jodrell bank 76  m lovell telescope at a frequency of 1400  mhz .",
    "a @xmath71mhz filter bank and a sampling time of 1  ms were used .",
    "since the maximum expected dispersion measure is small at this high - latitude location , dm @xmath72 pc  @xmath73 for @xmath74  kpc according to the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model , the limiting flux density for pulsations is insensitive to distance or period in the range @xmath75  ms , being 0.1  mjy for a duty cycle of 10% .",
    "a period in this range is expected for an older , geminga - like pulsar . for @xmath76",
    "ms , the sensitivity diminishes rapidly , to @xmath77  mjy at 10  ms .",
    "scintillation might be expected for these dm values and observing parameters , but our six observations should adequately sample most any such variability . finally , we obtained a single 9.3  hr pointing on 2002 february 18 with the same sampling as before , which reduces the nominal sensitivity to @xmath78jy , although scintillation may play a role here .",
    "no pulsations were detected in any observation .",
    "adopting an upper limit of 800  pc to the distance from the blackbody fit to the x - ray spectrum , a conservative upper limit on the pulsed radio luminosity of  is @xmath79  mjy  kpc@xmath80 .",
    "the least luminous young pulsar known in radio is the one in the supernova remnant 3c  58 , with @xmath81  mjy  kpc@xmath80 ( camilo et al .",
    "2002a ) , and there are only four pulsars known with @xmath82  mjy  kpc@xmath80 ( camilo et al .",
    "2002b ) in addition to geminga ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "1999 , and references therein ) . is certainly in contention as a radio - quiet pulsar , although it would not be surprising if more sensitive observations discover it at slightly lower flux density than explored here .",
    "the results of these deep x - ray , optical , and radio observations are quite revealing of the properties of . without exception",
    "they support the hypothesis that it is an older and possibly more distant cousin of the geminga pulsar , and readily identifiable with the egret source  in which error circle it lies .",
    "first , the x - ray source , which is primarily an ultrasoft blackbody of @xmath83  k , is significantly cooler than the oldest `` ordinary '' @xmath0-ray pulsars geminga and psr b105552 , which have @xmath84  k and @xmath85  k , respectively ( halpern & wang 1997 ; gelman & finley 1993 ) .",
    "most of the neutron star cooling curves that match the temperatures of geminga and psr b105552 drop to @xmath86  k at an age @xmath87  yr ( e.g. , yakovlev et al . 2002 ) , approximately 3 times the characteristic age of geminga . at the same time",
    ", the difference in temperature is not sufficient to account for the factor of 40 difference in soft x - ray flux between geminga and , so the latter may be as far away as 800  pc , as compared to @xmath88 pc for geminga . at the maximum distance ,  would be 340  pc from the galactic plane , not an unreasonable distance for a neutron star to have traveled in @xmath14  yr ( paper ii ) .",
    "even more important is the presence of an apparently nonthermal extension to the x - ray spectrum .",
    "all of the egret pulsars , even the oldest ones , have such `` power - law '' components that can be explained in terms of synchrotron emission from secondary particles that are produced in the conversion of primary @xmath0-rays in the strong magnetic field near the surface of the neutron star ( wang et al .",
    "no @xmath0-ray pulsar lacks such a nonthermal x - ray spectrum , while several middle - aged or older pulsars that might be expected to be egret sources based on their proximity and/or spin - down power have only thermal x - ray spectra and no @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "that a neutron star as cool as  possesses a non - thermal x - ray tail is encouraging of a connection with .",
    "all of the non - thermal manifestations of  are fainter than the corresponding emission from geminga : by a factor of @xmath89 in the optical , @xmath90 in the x - ray , and @xmath91 in the @xmath0-ray . its thermal x - ray flux ,",
    "although difficult to quantify , is also much less than that of geminga .",
    "while is relatively inconspicuous , it _ is _ the brightest soft x - ray source within the error circle of . if a fainter x - ray source were considered as a possible counterpart , it would only exacerbate the differences between this and other , identified egret sources as discussed in paper i.    finally , we mention once again the two pieces of evidence that suggest  itself is a priori more likely to be a pulsar rather than , e.g. , a blazar , the other major class of egret source .",
    "according to reimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) it shows no evidence for long - term variability , and its spectrum can be fitted by a relatively flat power law of @xmath92 from 70  mev to 4  gev , with a turn - down above 4 gev .",
    "in contrast , blazars are highly variable , and tend to have steeper spectra .",
    "the energetics of  are also plausible for a pulsar at @xmath93  pc since its @xmath0-ray luminosity ( assumed isotropic ) is @xmath94 ergs  s@xmath21 , comparable to the spin - down power @xmath95 of geminga ( @xmath96 ergs  s@xmath21 ) .",
    "efficiencies approaching 100% are achieved by the least luminous @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "fortunately , several future observations have the potential to confirm this scenario in detail .",
    "a pulsar detection is possible in a long observation with _ xmm - newton _ or with the _ chandra _ high - resolution camera if  is an `` ordinary '' pulsar , with @xmath97  ms and x - ray pulsed fraction @xmath98 , as is common for thermally emitting neutron stars that are also egret sources .",
    "we have also not given up on obtaining a radio pulsar detection . finally , the _ gamma - ray large area space telescope _",
    "( glast ) may itself be able to detect pulsations from  if a sufficiently long observation is made .",
    "we thank andrew lyne for obtaining the radio data at jodrell bank , and the referee patrizia caraveo for helpful suggestions .",
    "this work was supported by grants sao go2 - 3071x and hst go-09278.01a . the ability to obtain coordinated _",
    "chandra _ and _ hst _ observations under a joint proposal opportunity enabled us to achieve these results in a timely and efficient manner .",
