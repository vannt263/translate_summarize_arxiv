    "recently , slow anomalous diffusion , which is defined by the sublinear dependence of the mean square displacement ( msd ) on time , has been found in various phenomena including lipid granules diffusing in living fission yeast cells @xcite , colloidal particles diffusing on sticky surfaces @xcite and in networks of entangled actin filaments @xcite , mrna molecules diffusing in _ e. coli _",
    "@xcite , chromosomal loci diffusing in bacteria @xcite , telomeres diffusing in nuclei of eukaryote cells @xcite , and proteins diffusing in dextran solutions @xcite . to understand these phenomena , two types of slow diffusion models have been extensively studied so far : ( 1 ) continuous - time random walks ( ctrws ) @xcite and ( 2 ) the generalized langevin equation ( gle ) and fractional brownian motions ( fbms ) @xcite . for the ctrw model ,",
    "if the probability density function ( pdf ) of the waiting times between jumps of the particle is a power law @xmath0 with @xmath1 , the ensemble - averaged msd ( eamsd ) shows slow diffusion @xcite : @xmath2 '' to stand for an asymptotic relation , i.e. , @xmath3 means @xmath4 for some asymptotic limit such as @xmath5 .",
    "on the other hand , we use `` @xmath6 '' to stand for a stricter asymptotic relation : @xmath7 means @xmath8 for some asymptotic limit .",
    "furthermore , we use `` @xmath9 '' when @xmath10 is an approximation of @xmath11 , and `` @xmath12 '' when @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath11 , that is , they are not necessarily asymptotic relations . ] . typical origins of such power - law waiting times are complex energy landscapes @xcite and diffusion in inner degrees of freedom @xcite . similarly , eamsd of gle shows slow diffusion if the memory kernel @xmath13 decays algebraically @xmath14 with @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a possible origin of this non - markovian memory effect is the viscoelasticity of the medium @xcite .    a primary difference between these two stochastic processes  ctrws and gle  is in their ergodic properties .",
    "even if the memory kernel of a gle is given by a power function as stated above , the gle satisfies the ergodic property , that is , time - averaged quantities coincide with ensemble - averaged quantities @xcite .",
    "in contrast , this equivalence between the two averages does not hold in the ctrws with power - law waiting times .",
    "however , such ctrws exhibit an extended form of ergodicity  time - averaged quantities become random variables following a distribution function @xcite .",
    "this distributional ergodicity is called weak ergodicity breaking @xcite or infinite ergodicity @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned examples , ctrws are frequently used in various fields of science @xcite . however , there are cases in which some finite - size effects should be considered in order to compare the model with experimental data",
    ". in particular , cutoffs at the tail of the power - law waiting time distribution @xcite and spatial confinement effects @xcite arise in many systems .",
    "the typical origins of waiting time cutoffs are physical limits with respect to energy and spatial extensions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical analysis of the ctrws with such cutoffs is difficult , because it is necessary to investigate the transient behavior .",
    "however , this difficulty is avoidable by using the tempered stable distribution ( tsd ) @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the tsd has exponentially smooth cutoffs , and is a modified version of the truncated stable distribution , which has a sharp cutoff at the tail @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the tsd has the property called infinite divisibility @xcite , which allows a rigorous analysis even for transient behavior .",
    "the tsd is a special model for the cutoffs , but it shows typical behavior of cutoff distributions such as a slow convergence to the gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the generalized fractional fokker - planck equation ( gffpe ) , which we will use in this paper to study eamsd , has been derived for ctrws with tempered stable waiting times @xcite . the ergodic properties of the system without confinement have also been clarified in @xcite , where the existence of a clear transition from weak ergodicity breaking ( an irreproducible regime ) to ordinary ergodicity ( a reproducible regime ) was shown analytically for the case of a non - equilibrium initial ensemble ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : tsd ] for a precise definition of the non - equilibrium and equilibrium ensembles ) .",
    "another important finite - size effect is spatial confinements .",
    "for example , to understand the transport phenomena in cells @xcite , confinements due to cell membranes should be considered .",
    "confinement effects in ctrws with power - law waiting times were studied numerically in @xcite and analytically in @xcite ; it was found that the time - averaged msd ( tamsd ) shows a crossover from normal diffusion at short timescales to anomalous slow diffusion at longer timescales .",
    "they also reported numerically the weak ergodicity breaking in tamsd .",
    "recently , the ctrw model with the two finite - size effects ( i.e. , waiting time cutoffs and spatial confinements ) has been used as a model for the transport of lipid granules in living fission yeast cells @xcite , in which confinement effects are caused by a hookean force exerted by optical tweezers .",
    "the model clearly explains the experimental results such as the crossover in tamsd and weak ergodicity breaking .",
    "these studies mainly used numerical simulations , but a detailed theoretical analysis has not yet been reported . also , they studied only non - equilibrium ensemble , and thus the dependences of the ergodic properties on initial ensembles are still unknown .    in this paper , we present theoretical results for ctrws with two finite - size effects : the effects of cutoffs in the waiting time distribution and the confinement effects .",
    "in particular , we focus on tamsd as an observable , and study the crossover from normal to anomalous diffusion in the tamsd and ergodic properties in terms of the scatter of diffusion constant for the tamsd .",
    "the tamsd , which is often used in single - molecule tracking experiments @xcite , is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the position of the particle at time @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the total measurement time , and @xmath20 is the time interval .",

    ", it has been reported that @xmath22 behaves like a random variable depending on each time series @xcite .",
    "therefore , the scatter in tamsd or @xmath22 has been used to check the consistency of the model with experimental data @xcite .    in this paper",

    "jumps are permitted only to the nearest neighbor sites without preferences , although this can be generalized to jump length distributions with zero mean and finite variances .",
    "it is also assumed that the particle is reflected if it goes beyond the permitted region ( for example , if the particle jumps into the site @xmath25 , it is pushed back to @xmath26 ) .",
    "this system is a continuous - time version of the discrete - time random walks ( dtrws ) with reflecting barriers @xcite .",

    "equivalently , the characteristic function of the tsd , @xmath35 , is given by @xmath36 \\right),\\ ] ] this characteristic function is a special case of the tsd given in @xcite .",
    "this is because @xmath37 takes only positive values , and we need only one - sided distributions . more precise definition of the tsd and the derivations of the above equations are presented in appendix [ sec : app.tsd ] .",
    "the tsd in real space is also derived explicitly as follows ( for a derivation , see appendix [ sec : app.tsd ] ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the gamma function .",

    "in addition , the equilibrium ctrws show no aging even in the time regime ( a ) , and thus the model agrees the experimental data with respect to the property ( 3 ) , too .",
    "second , although we show that time averages for a class of observables including tamsd follow the ml distribution ( appendix [ sec : hopf ] ) , different distributions can arise for different classes of observables @xcite . as an example , we show in appendix [ sec : hopf ] a case in which long time averages follow the pdf called the bilateral ml distribution @xcite .    third , there are qualitatively different types of random walk models in random environments . recently",

    "finally , besides random walks in random environments , there are still several different mechanisms for anomalous behavior , e.g. , gle , fbms , and diffusion on fractal structures @xcite .",

    "<S> this convergence to ordinary ergodicity requires a long measurement time compared to common distributions such as the exponential distribution ; in other words , the weak ergodicity breaking persists for a long time . in addition , it is shown that , besides the tamsd , a class of observables also exhibits this slow convergence to ergodicity . </S>",
