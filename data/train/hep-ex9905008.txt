    "heavy quark photoproduction can be used to probe pqcd calculations with a hard scale given by the heavy quark mass and the high transverse momentum of the produced parton ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "two types of nlo calculations with different approaches are available for comparison with measurements of charm photoproduction at hera .",
    "the massive charm approach  @xcite assumes light quarks to be the only active flavours within the structure functions of the proton and the photon , while the massless charm approach  @xcite also treats charm as an active flavour and is thus only valid for @xmath6 .    the data taken by the zeus collaboration during 1996/1997 corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about @xmath7 .",
    "in a subsample of about @xmath8 a small calorimeter positioned along the beam pipe was used to tag low @xmath1 events , @xmath9 @xmath10gev .",
    "the results of the high @xmath1 region ( @xmath11 @xmath12gev ) have been published before  @xcite and will not be shown here .",
    "this is the first presentation of our low @xmath1 results .",
    "charm was identified by the observation of @xmath0(2010 ) mesons , which were reconstructed in the following decay modes : @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath16 and charge conjugates .",
    "the kinematic range studied was @xmath17 gev and @xmath18 for the high @xmath1 region , and @xmath19 gev and @xmath20 for the low @xmath1 region .",
    "the pseudorapidity is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the polar angle with respect to the proton beam direction .",
    "charged tracks were measured in the central tracking detector .",
    "cross sections were calculated in the photoproduction range of photon virtualities @xmath23 ( @xmath24 for the tagged data ) .",
    "@xmath25 events have been selected by means of the mass difference ( @xmath26 ) method  @xcite . in the high @xmath1 region",
    "we have observed  @xcite @xmath27 @xmath0 s in the @xmath28 decay mode with @xmath29gev , and @xmath30 in the @xmath31 decay mode with @xmath32gev ( @xmath33@xmath34gev ) . in the low @xmath1 region",
    "we triggered only the @xmath35 decay mode , and observed @xmath36 @xmath25 events in the range @xmath19 gev ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "all tracks were assumed to be pions and kaons in turn ; wrong charge @xmath25 combinations  @xcite were used as a background distribution ( dashed curve in fig .  1 ) , normalized outside the signal region .",
    "the @xmath25 differential cross sections in the low @xmath1 region are shown in fig .  2 to  5 .",
    "for comparing the experimental data to the nlo qcd calculations , we have used the @xmath25 branching value measured by opal  @xcite @xmath37 . for",
    "the charm fragmentation to @xmath25 the peterson  @xcite fragmentation function was used : @xmath38 ^ 2}\\;,\\qquad                 z=\\frac{p_{d^*}}{p_c}}\\;.\\ ] ] in the massive calculation @xmath39 was obtained from a recent fit of nason and oleari  @xcite to argus data .",
    "alternatively , the peterson fragmentation was replaced by fragmentation effects estimated by a leading order monte carlo ( pythia ) .",
    "initial and final state radiation were not included .",
    "the results of both calculations for the low @xmath1 region are shown in figs .  2 and  3 .",
    "the cross sections are compared with nlo qcd massive calculations using mrsg for the proton structure function ( sf ) and grv - g ho for the photon .",
    "the theoretical massive calculations are below the data , in particular in the forward ( proton ) direction , although the pythia fragmentation slightly improves the agreement .    a comparison with massless calculations  @xcite , which are expected to become valid mainly at higher @xmath2 , is shown in fig .  4 for several photon structure functions . some sensitivity to the photon sf seems to be present , but the excess in the forward direction is evident .",
    "the structure function gs - g-96 ho describes the data best .",
    "recently berezhnoy , kiselev and likhoded ( bkl ) have suggested a new model for describing @xmath25 photoproduction  @xcite . in this tree level",
    "pqcd @xmath40 calculation , they hadronize the ( @xmath41 ) state produced in pqcd , taking into account higher twist terms at @xmath42 .",
    "thus the model is supposed to be valid over the whole @xmath43 range studied .",
    "no explicit resolved component is used .",
    "singlet and octet color states both contribute to @xmath0 production .",
    "the color state ratio @xmath44 is a free parameter in this model and was tuned to the zeus untagged results  @xcite , yielding a value of 1.3 .",
    "comparison of these calculations , for the same octet / singlet mixture , with the zeus tagged low @xmath1 data is shown in fig .  5 .",
    "a better agreement with the data is observed than that for the nlo calculations .",
