    "the triangular lattice is the tiling of the plane by unit equilateral triangles . without loss of generality , we assume that the lattice comprises horizontal lines , as well as lines whose angles of incidence to the horizontal lines is either 60 or 120 degrees . a _ region _ in the triangular lattice is any finite union of these unit triangles and a _ lozenge _ is any union of two unit triangles which share an edge .",
