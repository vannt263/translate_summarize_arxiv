    "ir spectrometry is a powerful method to characterize the hundreds of exoplanets discovered by indirect methods , and ultimately to search for life on telluric ones , as it allows to evidence atmospheric signatures of interest ( h@xmath3o , co@xmath3 , ch@xmath4 , ... ) boosted by the thermal emission of the planet .",
    "the main challenge is to isolate the planet from its parent nearby star ; one of the very few possible methods is spaceborne nulling interferometry , allowing implementing very efficient coronagraphs at the diffraction limit . within this framework ,",
    "several space projects such as darwin@xcite , tpf - i@xcite , fksi@xcite or pegase@xcite , have been proposed in the past years .",
    "most of them are based on a free - flying concept to create hectometric pupils with an acceptable launch mass .",
    "but the price to pay is to very precisely position and stabilize the spacecrafts relatively to each other and also with respect to an inertial direction , in order to achieve a deep and stable extinction of the star .",
    "understanding and mastering all these requirements is a difficult challenge and a key issue towards the feasibility of these missions .",
    "thus , we decided to experimentally study this question and focus on some possible simplifications of the concept .",
    "since 2006 , persee ( pegase experiment for research and stabilization of extreme extinction ) laboratory test bench is under development by a consortium composed of centre national dtudes spatiales ( cnes ) , institut dastrophysique spatiale ( ias ) , observatoire de paris - meudon ( lesia ) , observatoire de la cte dazur ( oca ) , office national dtudes et de recherches arospatiales ( onera ) , and thales alenia space ( tas)@xcite .",
    "it is mainly funded by cnes r&d .",
    "persee couples an infrared wide band nulling interferometer , based on a modified mach - zehneder ( mmz ) and a geometrical achromatic phase shifter , a disturbance simulator and a cophasing system based on a lqg tracker for the optical path difference ( opd ) .",
    "the first results of the bench were already presented in ref .  ; in this paper , we focus on complete it with the latest improvements and results of the bench .    after a short description of persee goals and setup ( focused on recent changes ) , we will present in sec .",
    "[ sec : calibration ] its various calibration procedures .",
    "recent results are reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : lqg validation ] for the cophasing system and in sec .",
    "[ sec : nulling ] for the nuller .",
    "this section provides the reader with a very brief description of persee .",
    "much more details can be obtained by the interested reader from refs .  .",
    "the goal of persee is not to reach the deepest possible nulling . starting from a state of the art nuller of the 2006 - 2007 period",
    ", it is an experimental attempt to better master the system flowdown of the nulling requirements both at payload ( instrument main optical bench ) and platform levels ( satellites ) .",
    "the balance of the constraints between those two levels is a key issue .",
    "the more disturbances the payload can face , the simpler the platforms are , the lower the cost .",
    "the general idea is hence to simplify as much as possible the global design and reduce the costs of a possible future space mission .",
    "the detailed objectives have been described in ref .  .",
    "our main requirement is to reach a @xmath5 nulling ratio in the [ 1.65 - 2.45 ]  band ( 37% spectral bandwidth ) with a @xmath6 stability over a 10  h time scale .",
    "another important requirement is to be able to find and stabilize fringes which have an initial drift speed ( as seen from the interferometer core ) up to 150  .s^-1^ , as this can greatly simplify the relative metrology and control needs .",
    "we want to study and maximize the rejection of external disturbances introduced at relevant degrees of freedom of the optical setup by a disturbance module simulating various environments coming from the platform level .      in the original design ,",
    "three sources were used : a laser diode at 830  nm and a sled at 1320  nm for the dual band metrology system , and a black body used in the band @xmath2 $ ]  for the science path .",
    "the three sources were coupled in single mode optical fibers , that were joined close to each other at the focus of the collimator , to simulate the star . that configuration was not efficient , because the snr in the camera was too low ,",
    "the science spectrum was polluted by the sled flux , and the contrast was too low in the fringe sensor ( fs ) .",
    "so we had to change the configuration at the focus of the collimator , to have only one fiber that simulates the star .",
    "unfortunately , the black body was not powerful enough for the fs detectors to be used for metrology in addition to science .",
    "the adopted solution was to use an infrared supercontinuum source , a polychromatic source powerful enough to emit both in metrology and science paths .",
    "its pulse rate is at 20  mhz , much higher than the loop frequency of the fs ( 1  khz ) and the camera ( 100  hz ) .",
    "it was not possible to connectorize the supercontinuum fiber , so we designed a simple injection bench with two off axis parabola , to inject the flux in a single mode pcf fiber .",
    "the flux was even too high for the science camera , so we have to defocalize the pcf fiber to reduce the coupled light .",
    "another modification of the source module , presented in that conference  @xcite , will include a planet and a exozodical disk .      on the science spectrometer , two flux",
    "are measured in order to perform the calculation of the nulling rate on each spectral channel @xmath7 , by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the flux of the destructive interference , directly obtained at the nulled output iii of the mmz .",
    "@xmath10 is the flux of the same output , in the case of a constructive interference .",
    "it can not be measured simultaneously with @xmath9 , so we firstly used the flux of the related constructive interferometric output ii of the mmz .",
    "this solution has two disadvantages : firstly , the single - mode fibers of outputs ii and iii must be perfectly aligned , in order to have optimal injection in both outputs , and the two fibers should not be subject to differential displacements .",
    "secondly , the output ii is a coherent flux , so it is sensitive to opd variations . especially in that case , the differential phase at the output ii is not zero but 21 , thus the output ii is not strictly constructive and does not measure exactly @xmath10 .    for those reasons , we modified that reference channel , by positioning the reference fiber in front of the m@xmath11 collimator , selecting a part of the unused flux of the source , before the interferometric train .",
    "the flux @xmath12 of that output is not equal to the flux @xmath10 , but they are proportional : @xmath13 . also , the dynamics of the camera ( @xmath14 ) is not sufficient for the direct measurement of the desired nulling rate , that is why we use an optical density of transmission @xmath15 when we calibrate the coefficient @xmath16 , and we remove it for the measurement of @xmath9 .",
    "the goal is to reduce the contrast of the measurement to fit in the range of the camera . finally , eq .  ( [ eq : null ] ) becomes    @xmath17",
    "persee bench has two control loops in piston and tip / tilt , which require a few calibrations , as well as the scientific path",
    ". there are three types of calibrations . the first type ( sec .",
    "[ sec - spec]-[sec - actu ] ) depends only on the configuration , and need to be applied just once .",
    "the second type of calibrations ( sec .",
    "[ sec - tt - ref]-[sec - cam ] ) depends slightly on the environment , especially thermal drift .",
    "the last type of calibrations ( sec .",
    "[ sec - tt - cor ] , [ sec - opd - ref ] ) is strongly affected by thermal drift .      to calibrate the spectral bands",
    ", we used the method of fourier transform spectroscopy ( fts ) .",
    "the fts uses the properties of the fourier transform to determine the spectrum of a source with an interferometer . in most cases , the interferometer is a michelson with a mirror mounted on a translation , to scan the interference fringes . with a mmz ,",
    "the situation is slightly different . for each wave number @xmath18 ,",
    "the intensity as a function of @xmath19 is    @xmath20 ,    \\label{eq : fts1}\\ ] ]    with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the spectrum that we want to determine .",
    "then the intensity measured at the output of the interferometer is    @xmath24    then the fourier transform of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , is    @xmath27    with @xmath28 the dirac delta function , and @xmath29 the total flux .",
    "we find the case of the michelson interferometer , when the contrast is maximum and the phase is zero : @xmath30 . in the case of the mmz , we do not measure the spectrum of the source , but the product of the spectrum and the contrast .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     figure  [ fig - null-100s ] presents the first long - term measurement of the null rate over 100  s. we can see on the left figure that the null rate has a higher value than the best result : @xmath31 , but shows a very good stability over 7  h : @xmath32 .",
    "that measured stability is a decade better than the specification : @xmath33 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - null-100s ] ( right ) , the null rate spectral profile looks like the one presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - best - null ] : the null rate is better at the center of the spectrum than at the edges .",
    "the contribution of opd and flux mismatch are also higher at shorter wavelengths , and the contribution of polarization should be higher at longer wavelengths .",
    "the chromatic dispersion of the null rate is between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , so the amplitude is 7 times higher than on the best result .",

    "as we also demonstrate the capability of correcting injected disturbances , we should be able to achieve that result even with typical disturbances on the bench .",
    "persee showed a very high quality and performance well beyond the initial specifications . the large majority of goals has already been demonstrated .",
    "we have already presented some important lessons in ref .  , about thermal stability and control loop feasibility .",
    "however , we can complete these remarks by other conclusions .",
    "firstly , we elaborated a calibration scheme that can be applied to a space mission , although it must take into account the linear - parabolic drift.that procedure is fully automatic , and allows also to make an accurate analysis of the instrument .",
    "secondly , we showed that a lqg controller can manage the disturbances of the opd , to achieve a very deep null rate .",
    "an experimental sub - nanometer control has been demonstrated , even in the case of strong disturbances ( more than 100  nm  rms reduced to 1  nm  rms ) .",
    "that result was very important for persee , because we work in the near infrared , which is more sensitive to opd variations than thermal infrared used in projects like darwin .",
    "finally , we showed that thanks to a a very efficient design , we obtained null rates more than 10 times better than the initial conservative goal of @xmath5 , thus close to the requirement of a nuller for the observation of telluric planets .",
    "we achieved the deepest null ever achieved by a near - infrared nulling interferometer : @xmath0 on a 37% bandwidth , between 1.65 and 2.45  .",
    "persee bench shows also a very good stability over 100  s , and also over 7  hours .",
    "we still have to confirm this deep null rate over 10  hours , with the same type of stability , and with injected disturbances .",
    "the last steps will be the correction of linear - parabolic drifts , together with the use of a new source module , which includes a planet and an exozodiacal disk , presented in ref .   during this conference ."
