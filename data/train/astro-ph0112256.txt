    "the complex of clouds discovered by @xcite , and mapped in detail by ( * ? ? ? * cbt hereafter ) and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , was shown from fos spectra @xcite to be mostly photoionized by nuclear radiation , and to have bulk motion consistent with acceleration that is independent of radius ( * ? ? ?",

    "we show in  3 that the fastest knots have been accelerated to radial velocities blueshifted from galaxy systemic by @xmath223200 km  s@xmath4 , a pattern not evident in the single stis spectrum discussed by kc1 and ckb .",
    "we consider various mechanisms capable of accelerating clouds and knots in  4 , outline why the knots may be related to quasar  associated absorbers \" in  5 , briefly consider future observations to test this hypothesis in  6 , and summarize our conclusions in  7 . in this paper , we assume a distance to ngc 1068 of 14.4 mpc , so 1= 70 pc .",
    "deep spectra at high spatial resolution are necessary to map and characterize the various dynamical subsystems in this nlr .",

    "we used the @xmath25-wide slit ( @xmath26 on sky ) as a reasonable compromise between resolution and mapping efficiency . to maximize sensitivity , we binned pairs of pixels along the axis of wavelength dispersion during ccd readout of the m - grating spectra , yielding 60 km  s@xmath4 fwhm resolution .",
    "we planned to obtain spectra both along and perpendicular to the radio jet .",
    "however , available guidestars restricted us to p.a .  38 , close to the axis of the large - scale radio jet .",
    "after a standard stis peakup on the nucleus , we performed a small - angle offset perpendicular to the slit for each map position .",
    "we obtained five long - slit spectra before a safe event delayed the next spacecraft visit sufficiently that the large changes in the orbit of _ hst _ prevented us from reusing target offsets from guidestars .",
    "this required us to spend an unanticipated half - orbit a year later to reacquire guidestars .",
    "the added overhead , together with a slight positional shift between the two pointings , meant that we obtained a total of six spectra with parallel slits that cover @xmath232/3 of the area of the nlr , with spatial resolution 005 along the slit ( and jet axis ) and 019 in the perpendicular direction , see fig .",

    "the blue peak has flux ratio [ /h@xmath73 , but now the red peak ratio decreases monotonically through the profile from 17 to @xmath74 over a 1000 km s@xmath4 range .",
    "this decline implies that gas density increases with the velocity deviation from galaxy systemic , not what would be expected if most of the cloud mass is at velocities close to rest in the galaxy .",
    "g96 note that a cloud interacting with the jet must be sufficiently massive to avoid acceleration , implying @xmath75 @xmath76 here jet density and velocity are normalized to the values appropriate for the lighter jet model of @xcite for the ne radio lobe , @xmath77 is the age of the ne radio lobe from spectral aging as estimated by g96 , and the jet radius @xmath78 was measured by @xcite .",
    "if the average nlr cloud density is @xmath39150 @xmath12 , the entries in table 2 show that clouds are massive enough to remain adjacent to the deflecting jet .",
    "this value is consistent with the mean densities of galactic molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "elsewhere , radio and line emission are uncorrelated .",
    "g96 note that this is expected if the jet has swept all gas from the region .",
    "the high - velocity knots might then be ablated from molecular clouds in the galaxy disk that have rotated into the jet .",
    "the clouds accelerated would all be blueshifted because they would move predominantly away from and above the galaxy disk .",
    "similar clumps below the jet would sink into the denser disk where they would be subject to stronger drag forces and hence decelerated more effectively ( consistent with the gas distribution in the spectral maps of pfbw ) .",
    "three characteristics of the _ xmm / newton _ x - ray spectrum of ngc 1068 within 20  of the nucleus indicate that the gas is predominantly photoionized : ( i ) narrow radiative recombination continua ; ( ii ) in the he - like triplets the forbidden lines are stronger than the resonance lines ; and ( iii ) fe l emission is weak compared to the k shell emission of the abundant elements @xcite . however , subtraction of the predictions of a photoionization model from the spectrum shows residuals that may indicate a collisionally excited component or other effects @xcite",
    ".    moreover , near the v - shaped line - emitting feature whose apex is 3  ne of the nucleus ( at top of fig .  1 )",
    ", the @xmath79   spectrum from the _ chandra _ hetgs @xcite shows that resonance lines are brighter than forbidden lines , implying either a collisionally ionized component or strong resonant scattering .",
    "@xcite show that the collisional component lies at the x - ray subpeak reported by @xcite .",
    "the x - ray subpeak may represent gas in the galactic disk on the far side of the ne lobe and being compressed by it ( cf .",
    "pfbw ) . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : photo ] , photoionization models of the uv and optical stis spectra of kc1 also support this additional power source near the subpeak .",
    "two lines of evidence argue for shocks near clouds g - k :    1 .",
    "clouds g and k are close to the  ne radio subpeak \" , located 21 ne of the obscured nucleus @xcite , suggesting dissipation of kinetic energy and possibly cloud acceleration by the radio jet .",
    "nearby we find the doppler ellipsoid described in  [ sec : cloudinfo ] , whose expansion velocity of 1500 km  s@xmath4 will generate a post - shock temperature of @xmath80 k if the ambient medium is relatively stationary , fully ionized , and has 10% he abundance .",
    "to estimate the mechanical luminosity of the doppler ellipsoid , we assume that energy is injected at constant rate , that the shell shock is strong so that we can ignore the thermal pressure of the ambient gas , and that the bubble is within the scale height of the galaxy disk so that the ambient ism density is constant .",
    "then in the energy conserving phase of the bubble interior , the bubble radius and expansion velocity are related : @xmath81 by observation , @xmath82 myr .",
    "mechanical luminosity @xmath83 follows from @xmath84 pc = 100 pc with @xmath85 ( where @xmath86 has units @xmath87 ergs s@xmath4 and @xmath88 is the density of the ambient ism in @xmath12 ) , so @xmath89 l@xmath90 .",
    "overall , the filaments that delineate the bubble and maybe its associated ism shock emit @xmath442% of the nlr [ and h@xmath24 fluxes .",
    "dust absorption dominates opacity in a photoionized plasma like this nlr when ionization parameter @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is lightspeed , @xmath93 @xmath94 atom@xmath3 is the opacity assuming the standard galactic reddening curve , and @xmath95 is the recombination coefficient . the dust will compete successfully for ionizing photons in the highly ionized zone , suppressing line flux .",
    "a strong pressure gradient will also be set up so that the plasma density will be much enhanced by the time lower ionization species emit . in consequence ,",
    "a lower @xmath96 will provide an apparent model fit to the spectrum , close to the value preferred by kc for their denser component .",
    "this ionization parameter is closely related to the value of @xmath97 at which radiation pressure starts to dominate either the pressure gradient , or the dynamical acceleration of the ionized plasma .",
    "thus , the flow of dusty clouds falling toward the nucleus is intrinsically unstable above the dust sublimation point , with clouds being driven into outflow in the direction of slowest accretion ( i.e.  within the ionization cones ) .",
    "@xcite detail this scenario . in hydrodynamical simulations of cloud acceleration @xcite ,",
    "tenuous gas streams ablate from surfaces of massive clouds , which may be the source of the high - velocity features we observe .    in this nlr ,",
    "the flux in the ionizing continuum needed to maintain the observed line luminosity ( @xmath98 ergs  s@xmath4 , kc1 ) is comparable to the fir luminosity 1.5@xmath99 l@xmath90 .",
    "dusty clouds are accelerated radiatively by @xmath100 cm  s@xmath101 , so can reach their observed mean velocities of @xmath70 km  s@xmath4 over 35 pc . in fig .  3",
    ", the cloud line profiles indeed show less velocity structure than do the knots .",
    "this scenario ignores the role of the radio jet in agitating the nlr clouds @xcite .",
    "but , as discussed earlier , its influence may be localized to line broadening and ablation in specific jet / cloud and lobe / cloud interactions , for example between b and c @xcite and g and h @xcite .",
    "while the region of collisional line emission coincides with the base of the ne radio lobe , numerical simulations of a breakout lobe do not show ( d.  balsara , private communication ) a strong backflow vortex at its base that might form high - velocity shocks . in any event , many of the high - velocity knots have similar line profiles , and are found @xmath102 pc from the brighter parts of the jet .",
    "if the hv emission knots in ngc 1068 were instead viewed against the nuclear continuum , they would resemble in their kinematics the associated absorption line ( aal ) systems seen in a few percent of quasars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "kc1 argue from their spectral models that the putative uv absorber in the ne quadrant must block less than half of the nuclear light .",
    "if the blueshifted knots have the same extent along the line of sight as we see on the sky ( assumed here to be just resolved ) , they would cover at most 2% of the sky at the nucleus , consistent with values derived for some aal absorbers .",
    "such absorbers are usually thought to lie much closer to the source of hard photons than the 35160 pc radial distance of the clumps in ngc 1068 .",
    "however , recent photoionization models of high - resolution quasar spectra are establishing that aal absorbers lie at diverse distances from the agn , including a range comparable to those we see . for example , @xcite established that some absorbers in a balqso must be @xmath39700 pc from that nucleus and have kinematic structure similar to the hv components in ngc 1068 .",
    "high - velocity features are also visible on similar scales in stis spectra of ngc 4151 @xcite , although at more modest velocities ( 1400 km s@xmath4 ) than we see , and are not clearly connected to massive clouds as in ngc 1068 .",
    "the brighter blueshifted knots in ngc 1068 could be mapped in higher ionization lines with uv spectra to establish their optical depths and ionization structure . but this study would be arduous with stis because of their relative faintness and large reddening . unfortunately , the complex background emission makes the knots unsuitable targets for the high - efficiency cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) to replace stis on _",
    "now that specific targets are known up to 2  from the nucleus , practical spectroscopy is possible with optical and near - ir lines using integral - field spectrometers that are appearing on 810 m telescopes .",
    "an interesting constraint follows if such spectra find evidence of the h  i / ii recombination front present in optically thick clouds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "constraining the column will better constrain photoionization models to predict the full mass  hence ke , momentum , and ultimately the origin  of each knot and cloud .",
    "our stis spectral maps have resolved the spatio - kinematic structure of the nlr in ngc 1068 , and reveal that many compact knots in the foc image have large , exclusively blue - shifted velocities , ranging up to @xmath103 km  s@xmath3 from systemic . if these knots are optically thick in the uv continuum , they are good candidates for  associated absorber \" clouds present in other agn . lying 70150 pc from the nucleus , several form a broken spatio - kinematic ring of diameter 35 pc that is expanding at up to 1500 km  s@xmath4 . the ring is adjacent to the more massive but slower moving nlr clouds g ",
    "k , so may originate from ablata streams from disintegrating molecular clouds that are being photoionized and accelerated radiatively by the agn or mechanically by a knot in the radio jet .    by resolving this nlr",
    ", we have demonstrated that ground - based integral - field spectrometers will be able to constrain the properties of the emitting gas in ngc 1068 by using classical plasma diagnostics in the optical and near - ir .",
    "more fundamentally , we may have a convenient view onto gas associated with an important component of agn that is hard to study elsewhere because it is usually seen in absorption .",
