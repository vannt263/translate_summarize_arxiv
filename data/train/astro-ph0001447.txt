    "supernova remnants are appreciably aspherical and globally asymmetric .",
    "the asymmetry of ejecta indicates that the supernova explosion is highly non - spherical and contains non - radial flow ( see , e.g. , the review by goldreich , lai & sahrling 1997 and references therein ) . the non - radial flow in supernova explosion is suggested also from x - ray and @xmath3-ray observations of sn1987a ; one can not explain early detection of x - rays and @xmath3-rays from sn1987a without invoking large scale mixing ( see , e.g. , the review by bethe 1990 and the references therein ) .",
    "the origin of high velocity pulsars may also be ascribed to asymmetry of supernova explosion ( see , e.g. , burrows & hayes 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "asymmetry is amplified by the rayleigh - taylor instability in the early phase of supernova explosion ( see , e.g. , falk & arnett 1973 ) . according to detailed numerical simulations , the growth of the rayleigh - taylor instability accounts for matter mixing inferred from observations of sn1987a if there exists an appropriate seed of the asymmetry ( arnett , fryxell , & mller 1989 ; hachisu et al .",
    "1990 ; mller , fryxell , & arnett 1991 ; fryxell , arnett , & mller 1991 ; nagataki , shimizu , & kato 1998 ) .",
    "thus it is worth to consider the origin for the seed of asymmetry .",
    "goldreich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) discussed possible instabilities during the core collapse as a source of the seed .",
    "they suggested possibility that dynamically collapsing core might be unstable against non - radial perturbation and proposed to study the stability of the similarity solution of yahil ( 1983 ) . applying the polytropic equation of state , @xmath6 , to pre - supernova core",
    ", he obtained a similarity solution describing collapse of a spherical iron core . in this paper",
    "we show that his similarity is indeed unstable against a vortex mode .",
    "the method of stability analysis is essentially the same as that of hanawa & matsumoto ( 2000 ) who investigated the bar mode instability during collapse prior to protostar formation .",
    "velocity perturbation dominates over density perturbation in the vortex mode while both of them have similar amplitude in the bar mode .",
    "the growth rate of the vortex mode depends on the wavenumber , @xmath4 , of the spherical harmonics , @xmath7 .",
    "the vortex mode grows in proportion to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the epoch of protoneutron star and growth rate , respectively .    in  2 we review the similarity solution of yahil ( 1983 ) for our stability analysis given in  3 .",
    "we discuss the mechanism of the vortex mode in  4 and implications to type ii supernova in  5 .",
    "we show the asymptotic behavior of the similarity solution and perturbation in the region very far from the center in appendix .",
    "for simplicity we consider gas of which equation of state is expressed by polytrope , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the pressure and density , respectively .",
    "the hydrodynamical equations are then expressed as @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the velocity and gravitational potential , respectively . the gravitational potential is related with the density distribution by the poisson equation , @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the gravitational constant .    for later convenience , we introduce the zooming coordinates of bouquet et al .",
    "( 1985 ) to solve equations ( [ polytrope ] ) through ( [ poisson ] ) .",
    "the zooming coordinates , @xmath20 , are related with the ordinary coordinates , @xmath21 , by @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes a standard sound speed and is a function of time @xmath24 .",
    "the symbol , @xmath9 , denotes an epoch at the instant of the protoneutron star formation .",
    "the density in the zooming coordinates , @xmath25 , is related with that in the ordinary coordinates , @xmath13 , by @xmath26 we define the standard sound speed , @xmath23 , so that it denotes the sound speed at a given @xmath24 when @xmath27 .",
    "thus it is expressed as @xmath28 the pressure in the zooming coordinates , @xmath29 , is related with the that in the ordinary coordinates , @xmath12 , by @xmath30 substituting equations ( [ density ] ) and ( [ pressure ] ) into equation ( [ polytrope ] ) , we obtain the polytrope relation in the zooming coordinates , @xmath31 the velocity in the zooming coordinates , @xmath32 , is defined as @xmath33 this velocity denotes that with respect to the zooming coordinates , and includes the apparent motion , the last term in equation ( [ velocity ] ) .",
    "the gravitational potential in the zooming coordinates , @xmath34 , is related with that in the ordinary coordinates , @xmath17 by @xmath35    in the zooming coordinates , the hydrodynamical equations are expressed as @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "the symbols , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , denote the gradient and laplacian in the @xmath42-space , respectively .",
    "assuming stationarity in the zooming coordinates ( @xmath43 ) and spherical symmetry ( @xmath44 ) , we seek a similarity solution . under these assumptions equations ( [ sim1 ] ) ,",
    "( [ sim2 ] ) , and ( [ sim3 ] ) reduce to @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 . after some algebra we can rewrite equations ( [ sim4 ] ) and ( [ sim5 ] ) into @xmath49 and @xmath50 equations ( [ sim6 ] ) and ( [ sim7 ] ) are singular at the sonic point , @xmath51 .",
    "we obtain the the similarity solution by integrating equations ( [ sim6 ] ) and ( [ sim7 ] ) with the runge - kutta method . in the numerical integration we used the auxiliary variable of whitworth & summers ( 1985 ) , @xmath52 , defined by @xmath53 using equation ( [ wsvariable ] ) , we rewrite equations ( [ sim6 ] ) and ( [ sim7 ] ) into @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "similarity solutions exist for @xmath56 .",
    "figure 1 shows the similarity solution for @xmath3 = 1.3 .",
    "the solid curves denote @xmath25 while the dashed curves denote the infall velocity , @xmath57 .",
    "these solutions are the same as those obtained by yahil ( 1983 ) and suto & silk ( 1988 ) .",
    "they have the asymptotic forms of @xmath58 and @xmath59 the value of @xmath60 is 22.04 for @xmath3 = 1.3 .",
    "in this section we consider a non - spherical perturbation around the similarity solution .",
    "the density perturbation is assumed to be proportional to the spherical harmonics , @xmath7 .",
    "then the density and velocity are expressed as @xmath61 where the symbols with suffix , 0 , denote the values in the similarity solution and the symbols with the symbol , @xmath62 , denote the perturbations . substituting equations ( [ per1 ] ) throughout ( [ per4 ] ) into equations ( [ sim1 ] ) , ( [ sim2 ] ) , and ( [ sim3 ] )",
    ", we obtain the perturbation equations , @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67 these perturbation equations have singularities at the origin ( @xmath68 ) , the sonic point @xmath69 , and the infinity ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "these perturbation equations are the same as those of hanawa & matsumoto ( 2000 ) .    to obtain the boundary condition at the origin we use the taylor expansion of the perturbation . in the following we use the notation , @xmath71 and @xmath72 substituting equation ( [ dpotential ] ) into equation ( [ per-4 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath73 note that not only the leading terms but the second lowest terms are taken into account in equations ( [ per - density ] ) through ( [ dgravity ] ) .    substituting equations ( [ per - density ] ) through ( [ dgravity ] ) into equations ( [ per-1 ] ) through ( [ per-5 ] )",
    "we derive conditions for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 . from equation ( [ per-1 ] ) we obtain @xmath82 equation ( [ per-1 - 1 ] ) ensures that the terms proportional to @xmath83 vanish in equation ( [ per-1 ] ) .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath83 vanish in equation ( [ per-5 ] ) at any condition . from equations ( [ per-2 ] ) and ( [ per-3 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "these equations ensure that the terms proportional to @xmath86 vanish in equations ( [ per2 ] ) and ( [ per3 ] ) .",
    "similarly we obtain @xmath87 and @xmath88 from the condition that the terms proportional to @xmath89 vanish and @xmath90 and @xmath91 from the condition that the terms proportional to @xmath92 vanish .    from equations ( [ per-1 - 1 ] ) ,",
    "( [ high1 ] ) and ( [ high2 ] ) we obtain @xmath93 this condition is equivalent to the condition that either of @xmath94 and @xmath95 is fulfilled .",
    "the bar mode found by hanawa & matsumoto ( 2000 ) fulfills equation ( [ high3 ] ) .",
    "we seek the other mode that fulfills equation ( [ high4 ] ) . in the following we call the latter the vortex mode .",
    "since the perturbation is linear , the solution can be arbitrarily scaled . to normalize the solution we take @xmath96 in this paper",
    ". then we obtain @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 and @xmath101    we obtained an eigenfunction of this vortex mode numerically by the following procedures .",
    "first we integrated equations ( [ sim8 ] ) and ( [ sim9 ] ) to obtain the similarity solution for a given @xmath3 .",
    "second we obtained three linearly independent solutions for the perturbation around the origin by using the taylor series expansion , equations ( [ per - density ] ) through ( [ dgravity ] ) .",
    "third we integrated the three linearly independent solutions from the origin toward the sonic point numerically with the runge - kutta method .",
    "forth we obtained two linearly independent solutions satisfying the boundary conditions both at the origin and sonic point by taking linear combinations of the numerically integrated solutions .",
    "finally we integrated the two linearly independent solutions from the sonic point toward the infinity and obtained an eigenfunction satisfying all the boundary conditions as a linear combination of them .",
    "the eigenfunction should have an infinitesimal small amplitude at the infinity as shown in appendix .",
    "figures 2 , 3 , and 4 denote the numerically obtained eigenfunctions of @xmath102 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "the polytropic index is set to be @xmath3 = 1.3 in the figures .",
    "the eigenfunctions are normalized so that the radial velocity perturbation is @xmath103 near the origin .",
    "the non - radial velocity perturbation , @xmath104 , changes its sign around @xmath105 .",
    "the density perturbation is small . it should be proportional to @xmath106 [ see eq .",
    "( [ implication ] ) ] .",
    "the vortex mode of @xmath4 = 1 is different from the ghost mode of @xmath4 = 1 ( hanawa & matsumoto 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "the vortex mode denotes circulation streaming back through the core surface while the ghost mode denotes misfit of the gravity center to the coordinate center ( hanawa & matsumoto 1999 ) .",
    "the ghost mode has no vortex ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "the vortex mode of @xmath4 = 1 has the growth rate of @xmath108 = @xmath109 while the ghost mode has that of @xmath108 = @xmath110 .",
    "figure 5 shows the density and velocity perturbation in the cross section .",
    "the contours denote the iso - density curves of @xmath25 = 10 , 3 , 1 , 0.3 , and 0.1 while the central density is @xmath60 = 22.04 .",
    "the arrows denote the velocity vectors .",
    "we obtained the density and velocity by adding the eigenmode of @xmath111 = ( 2 ,  0 ) on the similarity solution for @xmath3 = 1.3 .",
    "the infall is a little faster in the @xmath112-direction than in the @xmath113-direction .",
    "figure 6 is the same as figure 5 but only the velocity perturbation is shown by the arrows in figure 6 .",
    "it shows that this eigenmode is an vortex flow in the meridional plane .",
    "in this section we discuss the mechanism for the growth of the vortex mode .",
    "we consider the conservation of vorticity to elucidate the growth mechanism . taking rotation of the equation of motion , we obtain , @xmath114 where @xmath115 since the rotation of the pressure force and that of gravity vanish .",
    "similarly the conservation of the vorticity is expressed as @xmath116 where @xmath117 since @xmath118 , we obtain @xmath119 for the perturbation of the vortex , @xmath120 . substituting the equation ( [ sol2 ] ) into equation ( [ per - vortex ] ) we obtain @xmath121 near @xmath68 .",
    "we can derive equation ( [ high4 ] ) from equation ( [ vortex ] ) since @xmath122 near @xmath68 in the vortex mode .",
    "we can derive also the growth rate of the spin - mode , @xmath123 , from equation ( [ vortex ] ) since @xmath124 near @xmath68 in the spin - up mode .",
    "the growth of the vortex mode as well as that of the spin - up mode is subject to the conservation of the vorticity .",
    "as shown in the previous sections the vortex mode grows in proportion to @xmath8 . in other words it grows in proportion to @xmath125 since @xmath126 .",
    "this growth rate is for the growth of the relative amplitude , i.e. , that for @xmath127 .",
    "the growth of the anisotropic velocity is proportional to @xmath128 where @xmath129 suppose that an iron core during implosion can be well approximated by a polytrope of @xmath130 .",
    "then the velocity perturbation of @xmath102 grows by a factor of 30 while the density increases from @xmath131 g  @xmath132 to @xmath133 g  @xmath132 .",
    "similarly that of @xmath134 grows by a factor of 25 during the same period .",
    "if the @xmath102 mode is amplified , the central core , i.e. , the protoneutron star has a bulk velocity relative to the envelope .",
    "this might explain a run - away pulsar from its natal nebula .",
    "if the @xmath135 mode is amplified , the anisotropic velocity will cause global mixing during the supernova explosion ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "this may explain heavy element exposure earlier than expected from a spherical symmetric model .",
    "it should be also noted that the vortex mode of @xmath111 = @xmath137 has velocity field similar to that of the eddington - sweet meridional circulation .",
    "if a pre - supernova star rotates slowly , the meridional circulation can be a seed of the vortex mode amplified during the implosion phase .",
    "convection during si - burning may also be the seed for the vortex mode .",
