    "<S> + local - susceptibility measurements via the nmr shifts of @xmath0p and @xmath1v nuclei in the high - pressure phase of ( vo)@xmath2p@xmath2o@xmath3 confirmed the existence of a unique alternating antiferromagnetic chain with a zero - field spin gap of 34 k. the @xmath0p nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate scales with the uniform spin susceptibility below about 15 k which shows that the temperature dependence of both the static and dynamical spin susceptibilities becomes identical at temperatures not far below the spin - gap energy .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic excitations of a low - dimensional quantum antiferromagnet have been one of the current topics among the condensed matter physicists . </S>",
    "<S> vanadyl pyrophosphate ( vo)@xmath2p@xmath2o@xmath3 had long been believed as a prototype of a spin-@xmath4 two - leg ladder which has a magnetic lattice intermediate between one and two spatial dimensions @xcite . the ladder model , however , has been rejected by an observation of a dominant magnetic interaction perpendicular to the supposed ladder axis via the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a dimerized ( alternating ) chain model has now been becoming accepted as an alternative starting point , although a mechanism of the major exchange interaction between distant pairs of v@xmath5 spins via po@xmath6 tetrahedra is still under study @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the ins experiments has also revealed the existence of the mode with a gap nearly twice the gap of the lowest excited triplet which can not be explained by a simple alternating - chain model . </S>",
    "<S> this mode has first been assigned as a bound state of two magnons possibly formed via interchain couplings @xcite , but it was difficult to account for the intensity comparable to the fundamental mode . </S>",
    "<S> recent nmr @xcite and high - field magnetization @xcite studies have suggested on this issue that the two structurally - distinguishable chains of v atoms , which were thought to be magnetically identical , have different spin - gap energies . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a natural explanation for the existence of two distinct modes with almost equal spectral weight , and has been supported by the subsequent raman - scattering experiments @xcite and theoretical studies on relevant exchange interactions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the above confusion concerning the modelling and interpretation of the experimental results of ( vo)@xmath2p@xmath2o@xmath3 comes not only from the unexpectedly strong v - v exchange via po@xmath6 tetrahedra , but also from the presence of structurally - inequivalent v chains @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , azuma have found that ( vo)@xmath2p@xmath2o@xmath3 transforms into another phase with different symmetry under pressure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all the v atoms occupies a unique crystallographic site in the high - pressure ( hp ) phase , so that the magnetic chains made of v@xmath5 spins are all equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , hp-(vo)@xmath2p@xmath2o@xmath3 will be a better example of the alternating antiferromagnetic chain with quantum spin @xmath4 . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we report microscopic characterization of the magnetic chains in the hp phase of ( vo)@xmath2p@xmath2o@xmath3 via nmr . a single spin component characterized by a zero - field gap of 34 </S>",
    "<S> k was found , presenting support for the double - chain scenario for the ambient - pressure ( ap ) phase .    </S>",
    "<S> single crystals of the hp phase of ( vo)@xmath2p@xmath2o@xmath3 were grown as described in @xcite . since the crystals were too small to observe an nmr signal , they were crushed into powders and the nmr measurements were made on these powders . </S>",
    "<S> standard spin - echo pulse techniques were utilized for most of the experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> an example of the field - swept @xmath0p nmr spectrum in the hp phase of ( vo)@xmath2p@xmath2o@xmath3 is shown in figure  [ fig:31pspectrum ] . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum in the ap phase @xcite is also shown for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum in the hp phase consists of a single line as expected from the unique crystallographic site of phosphor in the unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> this is contrasted with the ap phase where the spectrum splits into two groups of lines owing to the presence of two kinds of v chains with different gap energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the line - shape analysis revealed that the symmetry of an nmr - shift tensor at the p site is almost uniaxial . assuming the exact uniaxial symmetry , we determined the two independent principal values @xmath7 and @xmath8 corresponding to the shift with the external field parallel and perpendicular to the local symmetry axis , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in figure  [ fig:31kvst ] as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath7 and @xmath8 scale the bulk magnetic susceptibility @xmath9 which is corrected by subtracting the contribution of paramagnetic impurities . </S>",
    "<S> following the standard @xmath10@xmath9 analysis , the tensor components of the hyperfine coupling at the p site were determined as @xmath11 t/@xmath12 and @xmath13 t/@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> these values yield the isotropic and uniaxial components , @xmath14 t/@xmath12 and @xmath15 t/@xmath12 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 is larger than and different in sign from that due to the classical dipolar field of v@xmath5 spins @xmath17 t/@xmath12 , indicating that the v@xmath5 spins are transferred not only to the p-@xmath18 orbitals but also to the p-@xmath19 orbital .    </S>",
    "<S> the susceptibility of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) gapped spin system at temperatures well below the gap @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath21 @xcite . in order to determine @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> , we fitted the @xmath22 dependence of the isotropic component of the nmr shift @xmath23 below 10 k to the form @xmath24 , where the reduction of @xmath20 by fields is explicitly written . </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown in the inset of figure  [ fig:31kvst ] . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained parameters are @xmath25 % , @xmath26 k@xmath27 , and @xmath28 = 31 k which gives @xmath29 = 34 k with the use of the measured @xmath30 factor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath31 is in good agreement with that evaluated from the bulk @xmath9 but is larger than the values determined from the critical field of the magnetization process ( @xmath3223 k ) @xcite and the ins on polycrystals ( @xmath3225 k ) @xcite for unknown reasons . </S>",
    "<S> a free - induction - decay ( fid ) signal of @xmath1v has also been observed below about 50 k. the spectrum was obtained by integrating the fid signal while sweeping the external field . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22 dependence of the @xmath1v nmr shift @xmath33 determined from the peak position of the spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig:51kvst ] . </S>",
    "<S> also shown in the inset is a plot of @xmath23 versus @xmath33 with @xmath22 the implicit parameter . </S>",
    "<S> a linear relation found between @xmath23 and @xmath33 demonstrates that the @xmath22 dependence of the local spin susceptibility is identical for both the sites . </S>",
    "<S> this is a clear sign of hp-(vo)@xmath2p@xmath2o@xmath3 having only one independent spin component . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath33 was analyzed in the same way as that of @xmath23 using @xmath20 determined above . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22-independent orbital ( van - vleck ) shift was then obtained to be 0.182 % . </S>",
    "<S> the hyperfine coupling constant at the v site determined from the slope of the @xmath34 plot is @xmath35 t/@xmath12 , which is in a reasonable range as a core - polarization field of a @xmath36 transition - metal ion @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:31wvst ] shows the @xmath22 dependence of the @xmath0p nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 above 8 k was determined as the time constant of the exponential recovery of @xmath0p magnetization @xmath39 . below 8 k where non - exponential recovery appears , </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed @xmath39 by fitting to the form @xmath40 which incorporates the relaxation rate @xmath41 due to paramagnetic impurities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the inset of figure  [ fig:31wvst ] , @xmath37 exhibits activated behavior below about 20 k. the exponential decrease of @xmath37 is , however , masked below @xmath328 k synchronizing the appearance of non - exponential recovery . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic value of @xmath37 at low @xmath22 is suppressed by applying fields as expected for the impurity - limited relaxation rate . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 depends on @xmath42 at higher temperatures as well where the recovery is exponential , but the @xmath42 dependence roughly follows the 1d diffusive form @xmath43 as observed in ap-(vo)@xmath2p@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> details of the @xmath42 dependence of @xmath37 will be presented in a separated paper . </S>",
    "<S> the activation energy was estimated as @xmath44 k by fitting the data between 8 and 20 k to the form @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> as the interbranch ( @xmath46 ) transitions within the lowest excited triplet @xcite are expected to dominate the nuclear - spin relaxation due to the predominantly - isotropic hyperfine fields , the obtained @xmath47 would give an estimate of the zero - field gap . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 indeed agrees well with @xmath29 evaluated from the nmr shift .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : t1tkvst ] shows the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath48 divided by @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> one of the remarkable features of the result is that the ratio @xmath50 becomes @xmath22 independent below about 15 k. ( an upturn below @xmath327 k is due to the impurity contribution to @xmath37 and is extrinsic . ) </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that , while the nmr shift is proportional to the uniform static susceptibility @xmath51 , @xmath37 samples the dissipative part of the dynamical susceptibility @xmath52 at the nuclear larmor frequency @xmath53 @xcite ; @xmath54    here @xmath55 is the fourier transform of the hyperfine coupling . since @xmath55 has a maximum at @xmath56 = 0 , @xmath37 at the p site is most sensitive to @xmath57 which is dominant at low @xmath22 in a gapped 1d spin system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22-independent behavior of @xmath50 therefore indicates that the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath58 and @xmath51 at low @xmath22 is identical and should be described by a common energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> such a characteristic of the magnetic excitations in a gapped 1d spin system has been predicted theoretically based on a picture of free magnons @xcite , but has rarely been observed experimentally @xcite . to our knowledge , this is the first experimental verification of @xmath48 and @xmath10 having identical @xmath22 dependence at low @xmath22 , not relying on any model - dependent form of these quantities . from the experimental viewpoint , it is worth noting that the scaling between @xmath48 and @xmath10 holds below @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests nearly free propagation of magnons being realized at temperatures not far below @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore practical to use experimental data in the region @xmath60 for a reliable estimate of @xmath20 , although the activated behavior of physical quantities such as @xmath9 and @xmath37 is theoretically justified only for @xmath61 @xcite .    above about 20 k , the scaling breaks down and @xmath62 increases gradually with @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> this means that @xmath63 grows more rapidly than @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> as the temperature is now comparable with or higher than @xmath20 , interactions between magnons and/or the @xmath64 component of spin fluctuations will become increasingly important and would enhance @xmath65 over @xmath51 .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have measured @xmath0p and @xmath1v nmr in the high - pressure phase of ( vo)@xmath2p@xmath2o@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the temperature dependence of the local static spin susceptibility at the p site is identical with that at the v site . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath65 near @xmath66 also scales with the static susceptibility at low temperatures below about a half of the spin - gap energy which was estimated to be 34 k at zero field . </S>",
    "<S> all of these observations provides microscopic evidence for a unique kind of magnetic chain existing in the high - pressure phase of ( vo)@xmath2p@xmath2o@xmath3 , as well as for coexistence of magnetically - inequivalent chains in its ambient - pressure phase . </S>"
