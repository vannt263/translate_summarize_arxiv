    "the first difference corresponds to a precursor layer thickness and the quantitative form of the disjoining potential . under similar external conditions we found that droplets on smooth surfaces will roll - up before the ones on complaint surfaces  @xcite due to the steric forces .",
    "the distinct wall models also lead to a qualitatively different character of wetting transitions .",
    "a first order transition from partial to complete wetting occurs in the hard wall model only , turning to a second order transition in the soft wall model .    to capture a more realistic description of wetting transitions",
    ", we included a weak dependence on short - range polar interactions .",
    "analytical derivation of the disjoining potential was carried out exploiting the sharp interface approximation , which showed a good agreement with a direct numerical solution of dft euler - lagrange integral equations .",
    "we find that the qualitative nature of the sequence of wetting transitions stems from a competition between short- and long - scale interactions , best seen in the ( @xmath101 , @xmath152 ) parametric plane , while all other parameters , like temperature @xmath174 or short - range decay range @xmath175 have only a quantitative effect .",
    "the role of repulsive short - range interactions is analogous to steric effects , which are emphasized in the hard wall approximation .",
