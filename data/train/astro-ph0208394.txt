    "the x - ray luminosity function of galaxy clusters in the nearby universe provides a powerful cosmological probe .",
    "the observed luminosity function , @xmath7 , can be combined with a relation linking the observed x - ray luminosity and mass , and the mass function , @xmath8 , predicted by simulations , to obtain tight constraints on the combination of cosmological parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mean matter density of the local universe and @xmath0 is the root - mean - square ( rms ) variation of the density field smoothed by a top hat window function of size 8@xmath9mpc .",
    "observationally , the keys to such studies are precise determinations of the local x - ray luminosity function of clusters and the relation linking the observed x - ray luminosities and total masses .",
    "x - ray selection currently offers the best way to identify massive galaxy clusters , and the local x - ray luminosity function has now been precisely determined by the bcs ( ebeling 1997 ; ebeling 2000 ) and reflex ( bhringer 2002 ) studies .",
    "the flux - limited bcs and reflex samples , which are based on data from the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ; trmper 1993 ) , together include @xmath10 clusters and cover approximately two thirds of the sky .",
    "recently , significant effort has also been invested into measuring the local temperature function of clusters ( markevitch 1998 ; pierpaoli 2001 ; ikebe 2002 ) , which offers a complementary method for determining cosmological parameters . at present , however , the temperature function samples are significantly smaller than the combined bcs - plus - reflex luminosity function data set , and the analysis of the temperature function is complicated by the fact that these samples are selected according to x - ray flux as well as temperature , requiring the use of both mass - temperature and temperature - luminosity relations in the analysis .",
    "recent years have also seen significant efforts directed towards a precise calibration of the ` virial ' relations linking the observed luminosities , temperatures and masses of galaxy clusters ( horner , mushotzky & scharf 1999 ; nevalainen , markevitch & forman 2000 ; finoguenov , reiprich & bhringer 2001 ; allen , schmidt & fabian 2001b ; sanderson 2003 ) .",
    "in particular , the launch of the chandra x - ray observatory has permitted the first precise measurements of the temperature and mass profiles of relaxed clusters from x - ray data . using a combination of chandra and gravitational lensing data , allen ( 2001b ) confirmed that luminous , relaxed galaxy clusters follow the simple scaling relations predicted by theory , but that the normalization of the observed mass - temperature relation measured within @xmath11 ( where the mean enclosed mass density is 2500 times the critical density of the universe at the redshifts of the clusters ) is approximately 40 per cent lower than predicted by standard adiabatic simulations .",
    "this highlights the likely importance of additional physics such as cooling and pre - heating in the intracluster gas ( see also pearce 2000 ; thomas 2002 ; voit 2002 ; muanwong 2002 ) .",
    "theoretically , the primary requirement for cosmological studies using the observed luminosity and/or temperature functions of clusters is a precise prediction of the mass function .",
    "this has now been achieved for flat @xmath6cdm ( and @xmath12cdm ) cosmologies using the hubble volume simulations of jenkins ( 2001 ) and evrard ( 2002 ) .",
    "in this paper we present precise constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 based on the observed local luminosity function of the most x - ray luminous clusters in the extended bcs ( ebeling 2000 ) and reflex samples , and a new calibration , using pointed chandra and rosat x - ray observations and weak gravitational lensing results , of the mass - luminosity relation linking the masses of clusters measured within @xmath13 to their total @xmath14 kev rosat luminosities .",
    "having determined our combined constraint on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we show that the degeneracy between these parameters can be broken using chandra results on the x - ray gas mass fractions in the most dynamically relaxed clusters . including gaussian priors on the mean baryon density of the universe ( @xmath15 ; omeara 2001 ) , the hubble constant ( @xmath16 ; freedman 2001 ) , and a theoretical bias factor ( @xmath17 ; bialek , evrard & mohr 2001 ) relating the asymptotic baryon fraction in the most x - ray luminous clusters to the mean value for the universe as a whole , we obtain @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( marginalized 68 per cent confidence limits for an assumed flat @xmath6cdm cosmology ) .",
    "we compare our results to other measurements based on the local number density of clusters , evolution of the x - ray luminosity and temperature functions , the 2df galaxy redshift survey , cosmic microwave background anisotropies , and measurements of cosmic shear .    throughout this paper , a flat @xmath6cdm cosmology with @xmath18",

    "@xmath121 fixed , we obtain @xmath123 and @xmath124 .      an important aspect of the present work is the reduced level of systematic uncertainty with respect to most previous studies based on the local abundance of galaxy clusters . in the first case , the independent bcs and reflex studies have well determined selection functions ( ebeling 1998 , 2000 ; bhringer 2002 ) and provide precise , consistent results on the local x - ray luminosity function . with the large size of the combined bcs - plus - reflex data set ( which covers two thirds of the sky ) we have been able to limit our analysis to the most luminous clusters , with @xmath125  ( for an @xmath34 , @xmath68 , cosmology ) , for which the mass - luminosity relation has been calibrated using chandra and rosat x - ray data and weak lensing observations ( section  [ section : ml ] ) .",
    "the complicating effects of cooling and pre - heating are minimized for such massive clusters and a simple power - law model provides a reasonable description of the mass - luminosity relation ( fig .  [ fig : ml ] ) , albeit with some residual intrinsic scatter that is in part related to the different dynamical histories of the clusters and residual systematic effects in the mass measurements ( sections  [ section : dahle ] , [ section : ml ] ; see also below ) . repeating the analysis using only the bcs luminosity function data , or only the reflex data , or using a higher luminosity cut in the luminosity function ( @xmath126 ) , leads to consistent results ( although with larger statistical uncertainties ) .",
    "consistent results on cosmological parameters are also obtained if we replace the evrard ( 2002 ) critical spherical overdensity mass function ( section  [ section : theory ] ) with the jenkins ( 2001 ) mean spherical overdensity ( so324 ) prescription , scaling the cluster masses accordingly .",
    "the dominant statistical and systematic uncertainties in the analysis are associated with the mass - luminosity relation .",

    "a programme of weak lensing measurements for the other clusters in our chandra sample is underway ( gray , in preparation ) .",
    "in addition , consistent strong lensing mass measurements are available for abell 1835 , 2390 , rxj1347.5 - 1145 , ms2137.3 - 2353 and pks0745 - 191 ( schmidt 2001 , allen 2001a , 2002b , schmidt , in preparation ) . the presence of significant non - thermal pressure support on large spatial scales in these clusters can therefore be excluded .",
    "as well as increasing the size of our calibration sample , the inclusion of the dahle ( 2002 ) weak lensing data is important in that it allows us to examine the distribution of less dynamically relaxed systems in the mass - luminosity plane .",
    "whereas x - ray data can only be used to obtain precise mass measurements for dynamically relaxed clusters ( the x - ray mass measurements are based on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in the x - ray gas ) , lensing mass measurements are essentially independent of the dynamical state of the gravitating matter and so can be extended to systems undergoing merger events .",
    "the dahle ( 2002 ) sample includes clusters with a range of dynamical states .",
    "inspection of rosat and chandra images of these systems shows that many exhibit significant dynamical activity , with abell 141 , 209 , 520 , 1351 and 1576 undergoing major merger events .",
    "( similar conclusions are drawn by dahle 2002 from their optical data ) .",
    "the bcs and reflex samples , from which the x - ray luminosity functions have been constructed ( section  [ section : bcs ] ) , include all clusters above the respective x - ray flux limits , independent of their dynamical states .",
    "it is therefore important that the mass - luminosity relation provides a fair translation between luminosity and mass for all clusters included in the samples .",
    "although the 17 clusters in our mass - luminosity relation do not represent a complete subsample of the bcs and reflex data sets , inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : ml ] suggests that the dahle ( 2002 ) clusters exhibit a similar mean mass per unit x - ray luminosity to the relaxed systems studied with chandra , albeit with two significant outliers from the best - fit curve ( see below ) and , therefore , that the application of the mass - luminosity relation determined here to the bcs and reflex samples is reasonable .",
    "we have carried out a more rigorous test of the validity of the mass - luminosity relation by repeating the determination of cosmological parameters using other mass - luminosity relations constructed from subsamples of the calibration data . in the first case , a mass - luminosity relation based on the chandra mass measurements ( 10 clusters ) was examined . in the second case ,",
    "only the weak lensing measurements were used ( 8 clusters ) . )",
    "were fitted , as the dahle ( 2002 ) clusters do not populate the highest luminosity bin . ]",

    "both results are consistent with those obtained for the whole sample , @xmath129 , although for the lensing subsample the increased scatter in the mass - luminosity relation leads to larger error bars .",
    "it appears , then , that the inclusion of chandra mass measurements for dynamically relaxed clusters does not bias the best - fit result on @xmath0 significantly , but does reduce the formal statistical uncertainties . assessing whether this leads us to underestimate the true uncertainties in @xmath0 will require more data and the ability to disentangle whether the scatter in the lensing results arises primarily from the effects of correlated substructure ( or similar systematic problems in the lensing analysis ) , or the effects of dynamical activity on the x - ray gas ( see below ) .",

    "these authors suggest that major mergers can lead to significant short - term increases in the luminosities of clusters during the periods of closest approach , which are then followed by dips in luminosity as the merging dark matter cores move apart , before the cluster returns to equilibrium . from fig .",
    "[ fig : ml ] we see that abell 209 appears to have an unusually high x - ray luminosity / mass ratio , which may have been boosted by the ongoing merger activity in this cluster .",
    "( we note , however , that ms2137.3 - 2353 , which is a highly relaxed cluster with no obvious merger activity and a sharp central density peak , also appears to have a high luminosity / mass ratio and lies below the best - fitting curve . in this case ,",
    "the offset may indicate a relatively early formation epoch for the cluster . ) in contrast abell 1351 , which is also undergoing a major merger event , has an unusually low x - ray luminosity / mass ratio and lies above the best - fit curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : ml ] . detailed simulations and further observations are required to improve our understanding of the effects of mergers on the x - ray properties of clusters .",
    "however , the indications from the present study are that the effects of mergers on the mean mass - luminosity relation for the most luminous clusters are relatively small .    chandra measurements of the x - ray gas mass fraction , @xmath108 , in dynamically relaxed clusters provide one of the most simple and robust methods by which to measure @xmath1 ( see allen 2002a and references therein ) . the largest systematic uncertainties in the analysis lie in how well the measured baryonic mass fractions in the clusters approximate the universal mean . lowering the bias factor , @xmath116 , by @xmath130 per cent would cause the best - fitting value of @xmath1 to rise by a similar amount .",
    "similarly , although the @xmath108 profiles in fig .  [ fig : fgas_r ] appear to have converged , or be close to converging , at the outer measurement radii , any rise in the @xmath131 values beyond these points would cause a corresponding reduction in @xmath1 .",

    "secondly , our result on @xmath0 implies that the possible excess power detected at high multipoles ( @xmath168 ) in the cmb anisotropy power spectrum with the cosmic background imager ( mason 2002 ; bond 2002 ) is unlikely to be due to the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect .",
    "our results also have important implications for future x - ray and sz clusters surveys , since the number of clusters detected at high redshifts with high x - ray luminosities , temperatures and sz fluxes will be much lower in a @xmath169 universe than predicted by simulations with @xmath170 .",
    "finally , we suggest that given the precision of the constraints on @xmath1 available from current chandra @xmath107 data for relaxed clusters , and the relatively small systematic uncertainties involved , the @xmath107 data should be considered as a powerful probe in future cosmological work , complementary to measurements of redshift evolution in the x - ray temperature and luminosity functions of galaxy clusters .",
