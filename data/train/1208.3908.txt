    "[ a_bps ] ) , which is obviously associated with a localized magnetic flux inversion .",
    "this inversion becomes more pronounced for @xmath105  values near to @xmath104 .",

    "[ b_bps ] ) reveals that the magnetic field flips its signal , showing explicitly localized magnetic flux reversion .      in a first view ,",
    "[ b_bps ] seems to show that the magnetic flux varies with the value of @xmath105 .",

    "an explicit plot of the function @xmath108 clearly shows that for every @xmath109 the magnetic flux is the same independently of the localized magnetic field reversion .",

    "as it occurs with the magnetic field , the electric profiles become narrower and higher while @xmath105  increases tending to @xmath104 . now , the difference is that , for @xmath112 the profiles become negative ( as predicted after bps equations ) .",
    "a close zoom along the @xmath113axis ( see insertion in fig . [ el_bps ] ) , however , reveals that the electric field undergoes inversion both for positive and negative values of @xmath105 .",
    "such reversion is ubiquitous in all profiles .      the bps energy density ( [ h_def_pos ] ) is exhibited in fig .",
    "energy_bps , having profiles very similar to the magnetic field ones , being more localized and possessing a higher amplitude , however .",
    "as the bpsenergy density is positive - definite , no inversion regions are observed , naturally .    by looking at the profiles of the bps solutions",
    "it is observed that the spatial thickness is controlled by the lorentz - violating parameter , allowing to obtain compactlike defects as in  the uncharged case analyzed in ref .",
    "the present model is being regarded as an effective electrodynamics , which subjected to the usual vortex ansatz , provides vortex solutions in a dielectric continuum @xcite , as already mentioned in ref .",
    "this interpretation allows to consider lorentz - violating parameters with magnitude above the values stated by the known vacuum upper - bounds .",
    "these charged vortex configurations are endowed with several interesting features , as space localization ( exponentially decaying behavior ) , integer magnetic flux quantization , magnetic flux and electric field reversion .",
    "specifically , the localized magnetic flux inversion is a very interesting phenomenon , with sensitive appeal in condensed matter superconducting systems .",
    "recently , a magnetic inversion was reported in the context of fractional vortices in superconductors described the two - component ginzburg - landau ( tcgl ) model @xcite . in it , the magnetic flux is fractionally quantized and delocalized , presenting a @xmath114 decaying behavior , and a subtle reversion .",
    "such scenario , however , differs from the one described by our theoretical model , which provides a localized magnetic flux of controllable extent , exhibiting flux inversion just for the parameters that yields narrower ( compactlike ) profiles .",
    "one should still note that the set of parameters here analyzed is only one of the many theoretical possibilities available .",
    "so , it can exist a set of parameters for which the magnetic flux might undergo a more accentuated reversion , reaching more appreciable flipping magnitudes .",
    "such behavior could be associated with a complex @xmath79 parameter , yielding oscillating solutions which become less localized ( and more similar with the ones of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . another interesting way is to investigate this theoretical system in the presence of lorentz - violating terms in the higgs sector .",
