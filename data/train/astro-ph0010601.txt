    "the x - ray transient grs 1915 + 105 was discovered by castro - tirado et al .",
    "( 1992 ) using the watch all - sky monitor on the _ granat _ satellite .",
    "since then it has been one of the most luminous x - ray sources in the sky .",
    "the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ )",
    "has been monitoring it frequently and a rich pattern of variability has emerged from these data with time scales from years down to 15 msec ( see e.g. , morgan , remillard , & greiner 1997 ; muno , morgan , & remillard 1999 ; belloni et al . 2000 ) .",
    "often the overall spectral shape in the 250 kev energy range has been modeled with a disk blackbody accompanied by a power law tail ( e.g. belloni et al .",
    "1997 ; muno et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "a power law , however , is not a good approximation to the comptonization spectrum in the energy range close to the peak of the blackbody .",
    "this fact inspired us to use a thermal comptonization code by poutanen & svensson ( 1996 , ps96 ) to model the spectrum .",
    "vilhu & nevalainen ( 1998 ) applied a similar analysis to a selected set of observations of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "a spherical geometry for the hot comptonizing plasma cloud is assumed where the seed soft photons are coming from the surrounding cool disk which has some overlap with the central cloud ( poutanen , krolik , & ryde 1997 ) . a geometry , with no overlap between the disk and the hot cloud ( `` corona '' )",
    ", can correspond to a physical situation when the central part of the disk is overheated ( beloborodov 1998 ) at large accretion rates .",
    "the central hot cloud can also be related to the innermost part of the jet . in the opposite situation , when there is a large overlap between the disk and corona , we arrive at a simple disk - corona model ( e.g. haardt & maraschi 1993 ; svensson & zdziarski 1994 ; stern et al .",
    "physically this could correspond to the release of a large fraction of the total energy in the surface layers of the accretion disk , for example , due to annihilation of buoyant magnetic fields ( e.g. tout & pringle 1992 ; miller & stone 2000 ) . the adopted geometry is thus quite generic and it can represent well the x - ray emitting region in a number of physical situations .    an important question is whether the energy distribution of electrons responsible for comptonization is thermal or non - thermal . in cygnus x-1 , for example , when the spectrum is hard , electrons are mostly thermal ( gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ; poutanen 1998 ) , while in the soft state , comptonization probably proceeds in hybrid , thermal / non - thermal plasmas ( poutanen & coppi 1998 ; gierliski et al .",
    "the lower energy photons ( below @xmath0 kev ) are produced mostly by a thermal population of electrons , and the high energy tail extending to @xmath1 mev is produced by single scattering off non - thermal electrons .",
    "up to date , there are no detailed spectral studies of grs 1915 + 105 using physical models .",
    "however , if one uses cyg x-1 as an analogy , one can argue that thermal comptonization probably dominates the spectra below 2050 kev . in the present paper ,",
    "a thermal comptonization model is applied to the _ rxte _  data of grs 1915 + 105 collected from several observing intervals during 19961997 .",
    "we collected 36 proportional counter array ( pca ) and high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) observations of grs 1915 + 105 , performed during 199697 , from the ` production ' archive of _ rxte _ , with typical observing times of a few hours .",
    "the selection procedure was rather random , its main purpose was to extract a sufficient number of low , medium and high luminosity states of the system .",
    "figure  [ asm ] shows the asm ( all sky monitor ) light curve with the selected pca and hexte observations marked . the data with 128 ( pca standard 2 data ) and 64 ( hexte ) channels of spectral information and 16 s temporal resolution of five pcu s ( proportional counter units ) and both hexte clusters were used .",
    "the background was subtracted ( using pcabackest and hexte rocking ) although its effect is not crucial , since we limited the pca and hexte spectra in the range 220 kev and 1560 kev , respectively .    inside each of the 36 observation",
    "periods the data were binned into separate luminosity groups ( 15 ) to accumulate a spectrum ( using pca count rate criterion ) , resulting in 101 individual spectra .",
    "single spectra were used to represent the non - variable lull - state observations ( the long minimum phase in the middle of fig .  [ asm ] ) , while strongly oscillating observations were divided into 5 luminosity classes .",
    "these 5-class observations were 20402 - 01 - 33 - 00 ( 300026000 counts s@xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , 20402 - 01 - 37 - 01 ( 3000 - 35000 counts s@xmath2 , @xmath4 ) , 20402 - 01 - 43 - 00 ( 500045000 counts s@xmath2 , mixed @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and 20402 - 01 - 44 - 00 ( 500040000 counts s@xmath2 , @xmath5 ) where the ranges of the five pcu s count rates and the variability types by belloni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are given in the parentheses .",
    "on the average a typical observation was split into three classes .",
    "the comptonizing cloud ( corona ) is represented as a homogeneous sphere of radius @xmath7 and thomson optical depth @xmath8 .",
    "the electrons in the cloud are assumed to have thermal distribution of temperature @xmath9 .",
    "the optically thick disk supplying seed photons for comptonization and penetrating into the central cloud has an inner radius @xmath10 .",
    "radiative transfer in the corona ( comptonization ) is handled by the code of ps96 for a hemispherical geometry of the corona . in order to model the radiative transfer in a sphere ,",
    "the boundary condition at the bottom of the hemisphere is modified .",
    "a photon crossing the bottom can be mirror - reflected instead of being absorbed by the disk ( or compton reflected ) with the probability defined by the ratio @xmath11 ( poutanen et al .",
    "the angle - dependent compton reflection from the disk of neutral material is computed using green s function of magdziarz & zdziarski ( 1995 ) .",
    "the radial dependence of the disk temperature is that of the classical viscous disk @xmath12 at @xmath13 and @xmath14 inside the coronal region ( between @xmath15 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "there are a few reasons why such a temperature profile is chosen .",
    "first , if a large fraction of the total power is dissipated in a corona which has large scale - height and covers a significant part of the inner cold disk , the reprocessing of coronal hard x - rays can produce a rather flat temperature profile .",
    "second , owing to the stress - free inner boundary condition at the marginally stable orbit , the temperature profile even in a standard disk is rather flat between @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 ) .",
    "third , if @xmath19 , the @xmath20 profile diverges .",
    "regarding spectral fitting , the actual temperature profile makes little difference .",
    "the local spectrum was assumed to be a blackbody .",
    "the total spectrum contains a blackbody - type component , a comptonized tail and a compton reflection component . to obtain both @xmath9 and @xmath8 is beyond the _ rxte _   capability , therefore we fixed @xmath21 at 70 kev ( but also made numerous fits with @xmath22 kev and 150 kev ) . instead of @xmath8",
    ", we then used the @xmath23-parameter ( @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ) which determines the spectral slope .",
    "thus , the free parameters of the model are @xmath11 , @xmath23 and @xmath26 .",
    "the inclination @xmath27 was used , assuming that the radio jet is perpendicular to the disk ( mirabel & rodrguez 1994 ) . the important fact",
    "to notice is that the relative normalization between the disk and the comptonized components is not free , but is a function of the model parameters mostly depending on @xmath8 ( or @xmath23 ) and @xmath11 .",
    "the pca / hexte spectra of grs 1915 + 105 were fitted using xspec v.10 ( arnaud 1996 ) , and allowing 2% systematic errors .",
    "the reduced @xmath28-values are less than 2.2 in all data sets , less than 1.6 in 64 sets , and less than 1.2 in 32 sets ( for 132 degrees of freedom using 138 energy bins ) .",
    "the neutral hydrogen column density @xmath29 was frozen at @xmath30 .",
    "this value is the best acceptable common value for spectra with high , intermediate and low luminosities .",
    "it is lower than that used in many previous works ( e.g. muno et al .",
    "1999 used @xmath31 ) .",
    "however , our value is close to the galactic @xmath29 in the direction of grs 1915 + 105 ( using dickey & lockman 1990 data , ftools / nh gives @xmath32 , see also rodrquez et al .",
    "the normalization factor between pca and hexte data was allowed to vary freely , with the best - fit always giving hexte / pca = @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ multi ] shows the best - fit results as a function of the disk luminosity @xmath34 ( assuming a distance of 12.5 kpc , see chaty et al .",
    "1996 ; fender et al .",
    "1999 ) which was computed from the blackbody flux corrected for scattering in the corona and the @xmath35 angular dependence of the disk luminosity . @xmath34 and",
    "@xmath26 together then determine the physical size of the system @xmath15 and @xmath7 ( assuming blackbody emission ) .",
    "the hard luminosity , @xmath36 , is computed from the ( approximately isotropic ) flux in the comptonized component ( plus reflection ) .",
    "the inner disk temperature @xmath26 and @xmath11 strongly correlate with the disk luminosity ( figs .",
    "[ multi]a , d ) . the coronal @xmath23-parameter anticorrelates with @xmath34 depending on @xmath37 nearly linearly ( fig .",
    "[ multi]b ) . for low @xmath34 ,",
    "the spectra are hard , and for large @xmath34 the spectra are soft .",
    "the hard comptonized luminosity , @xmath36 , is relatively constant and in some cases of large @xmath34 significantly decreases ( fig .  [",
    "multi]f ) .",
    "the geometry of the system ( determined by the ratio @xmath11 ) changes dramatically when @xmath34 varies . for large @xmath34 ,",
    "the normalization of the comptonized component decreases relative to the disk component , leading to @xmath38 . in our model , @xmath39 means that only a small fraction @xmath40 of soft disk photons are getting comptonized , while the majority reaches the observer directly .",
    "we would not advise to take the ratios @xmath11 at their face value since we made an assumption of a constant @xmath9 ( see   [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "one can conclude , however , that the number of soft photons that are intercepted by the corona ( `` scattered fraction '' ) decreases dramatically when @xmath34 increases .",
    "the inner disk radius ( fig .  [ multi]e ) is rather constant ( 2540 km , without relativistic and color corrections ) .",
    "however , in two observations ( 20402 - 01 - 43 - 00 and 20402 - 01 - 44 - 00 ) the radii increased above 50 km during their lowest luminosity phases ( downs in fig .",
    "[ multi]e , while ups in fig .",
    "[ multi]e represent their high luminosity phases ) .",
    "these two particular observations have @xmath5-type light curves ( see fig .",
    "2x in belloni et al .",
    "2000 ) where the long minimum phases last 1015 min ( mini - lulls ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that these two observations preceded by 10 days those by mirabel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) with a similar light curve during which ejections of weak jets were discovered ( seen in ir and radio ) .    to permit a comparison with models using a power law",
    ", we also fitted all our spectra with the ` wabs + diskbb + powerlaw ' model of xspec ( which we call the power law model hereafter ) fixing @xmath41 .",
    "the best - fit power law photon index , @xmath42 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ multi]c .",
    "one sees an anticorrelation between @xmath42 and @xmath23-parameter which is well represented by the relation @xmath43 ( beloborodov 1999 ) .",
    "= 7.5 cm    to illustrate the difference between the comptonization and the power law models , we show the data for two observations together with the model spectra in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "( a gaussian line at 6.4 kev is added to both models . )",
    "we note that the power law model strongly overestimates the low energy part of the hard component , and therefore strongly underestimates the amplitude of the blackbody component ( dotted curves ) .",
    "for example , the amplitude of the blackbody in the power law fit is by a factor of four too low in the upper panels ( marked lull ) .",
    "another strong effect is the difference in the @xmath29 determined with the two models .",
    "since the power law continues to low energies without a cutoff , the best fit @xmath29 is @xmath44 , while for the comptonization model @xmath45 .",
    "the power law model overestimates the total , corrected for absorption , luminosity if one extrapolates the model spectrum to low energies and gives also a poorer fit to the hard lull - spectrum ( compare left and right panels in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ) .",
    "a strong correlation between the ratio @xmath11 and the luminosity @xmath34 means that the coronal size @xmath7 decreases when @xmath34 increases ( since @xmath46 const ) .",
    "physically this means that the range of the disk surface where energy is dissipated in the optically thin phase ( corona ) shrinks .",
    "when spectra are relatively hard , the geometry of the system is similar to a disk - corona . for large @xmath34 and softer spectra , the comptonizing plasma does not cover the disk .",
    "one can speculate that in this case hard x - rays are produced in the innermost part of the jet - like structure within the disk inner radius .",
    "we can not be certain , however , that the change in the geometry ( i.e. @xmath11 ) obtained from the fitting is real .",
    "the problem is that we assumed a constant @xmath9 ( since the _ rxte _   data do not allow us to determine @xmath9 unambiguously ) . if one fixes @xmath9 at another value , the result does not change qualitatively ( see fig .",
    "[ multi]d where a systematic effect on @xmath11 is shown by the solid curves for @xmath47 kev and 150 kev ) . however , if @xmath9 is allowed to vary the situation changes .",
    "let us consider a case of large @xmath34 when @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( for @xmath50 kev ) . in this case",
    "only about 3% of soft disk photons are scattered in the corona .",
    "the same fraction is scattered also if @xmath51 ( here about @xmath52 of soft photons are produced within the corona ) and @xmath53 .",
    "then the normalization of the comptonized spectrum relative to the blackbody emission is about the same .",
    "the spectral shape does not change much since for small optical depths and mildly relativistic temperatures the contribution of multiply scattered photons is small .",
    "therefore , the electron temperature has to increase to only about 90 kev in order to produce a similar comptonized spectrum in the 370 kev energy range . from this analysis",
    "we can only conclude that the scattered fraction decreases when @xmath34 increases .",
    "if the geometry of the system does not change , i.e. @xmath54 , @xmath8 should decrease much more than is shown in fig .",
    "[ multi]b .",
    "one should note that this discussion is meaningful only if the spectra are indeed produced by thermal comptonization .",
    "our choice of the disk temperature profile ( @xmath55 is constant inside the corona ) has also some ( small ) effect on @xmath11 , while the effect is completely negligible for other fitting parameters .",
    "for the most extreme hard spectra ( marked lull ) when @xmath51 , the number of seed photons is doubled if the peak temperature is reached at @xmath15 ( instead of @xmath7 ) , so that @xmath8 should be smaller by a factor of 2 in order to produce similar spectra .",
    "the mass accretion rate in grs 1915 + 105 is high amounting to @xmath56 ( for a @xmath57 black hole ) , where @xmath58 g s@xmath2 corresponds to a radiative efficiency of 0.1 .",
    "the inner disk radius lies in a rather narrow range of 2540 km and the soft and hard state radii do not differ considerably .",
    "one should be cautious with the absolute @xmath15-values derived , since relativistic and color corrections can be large . using the results by zhang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) at inclination @xmath59 , one obtains the factors 1.23 and 1.07 for a non - rotating and an extreme prograde kerr hole , respectively , by which the radii in fig .",
    "[ multi]e should be multiplied to obtain the innermost radius of the disk . after these corrections",
    "the mass of grs 1915 + 105 should be smaller than @xmath60 and @xmath61 for a non - rotating and an extreme prograde kerr hole , if the average radius derived ( 30 km in fig .",
    "[ multi]e ) equals the last marginally stable orbit ( @xmath16 and @xmath62 for a non - rotating and kerr hole , respectively ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the _ rxte _  data of grs 1915 + 105 in a broad luminosity range @xmath63 can be modeled with a thermal comptonization model .",
    "we find a strong correlation between the spectral slope , the disk temperature , and the disk luminosity @xmath34 .",
    "the hard comptonized luminosity decreases somewhat when the total luminosity increases ( meaning that the fraction of total power dissipated in an optically thin plasma decreases substantially with luminosity ) . the scattered fraction of seed soft photons and the optical depth of the comptonizing plasma decrease with @xmath34 .",
    "there are indications that the size of the corona @xmath7 shrinks at large luminosities , but this can be mimicked by corresponding changes in the optical depth .",
    "detailed modeling of the broadband spectra ( at least up to 300 kev ) is needed to discriminate between those possibilities .",
    "the biggest question is , however , whether a pure _ thermal _ comptonization model is applicable to grs  1915 + 105 .    finally , we would like to point out that spectral fits using xspec diskbb + power law model underestimate the amplitude of the blackbody component and therefore the corresponding size of the emitting region",
    "this model also overestimates the absorption column density and the luminosity corrected for absorption .",
