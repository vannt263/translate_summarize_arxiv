    "the edge - on spiral galaxy ngc  253 is one of the two prototypical , nearby starburst galaxies ( along with m82 ) .",
    "its distance of 2.5  mpc @xcite enables its starburst disk to be studied at very high linear resolution , since 1  corresponds to only 12  pc .",
    "the galaxy contains an inner starburst disk roughly 1520  ( 180240  pc ) in extent that has been studied in detail , especially by virtue of its emission in the infrared @xcite and in molecular lines @xcite .",
    "subarcsecond - resolution imaging at centimeter wavelengths reveals at least 64 compact radio sources in the inner disk @xcite ; these are thought to be roughly equally divided between 2  regions dominated by thermal emission , and supernova remnants dominated by nonthermal emission @xcite . at the centimeter wavelengths where radio telescopes are most sensitive , the poorer resolution and the increasing strength of the more diffuse galaxy emission lead to confusion that prevents complete source identification in the inner 200-pc starburst .",
    "the 200-pc region clearly dominates the current star formation in ngc  253 , as shown by the infrared , millimeter , and centimeter observations .",
    "centimeter imaging of this inner starburst indicates a supernova rate of @xmath60.3  yr@xmath4 @xcite , which is consistent with results of 0.10.3  yr@xmath4 inferred from models of the infrared emission of the entire galaxy @xcite .",
    "near- and mid - infrared imaging at arcsecond resolution shows a number of emission peaks that do not generally line up with the radio sources @xcite , while hubble space telescope images show at least four compact star clusters , which also do not coincide with individual compact radio sources @xcite .",
    "thus , it is apparent that extinction and confusion play major roles in the inner disk at different wavebands , and it may be that only the centimeter and millimeter images reveal the regions of most recent star formation .    outside the 200-pc starburst disk , ngc  253 may have a significant amount of star formation , as shown by the existence of larger - scale radio emission @xcite .",
    "since this part of the galaxy is much less affected by confusion and extinction , there is greater potential for identifying the strongest regions of star formation and studying them in multiple bands .",
    "however , recent high - resolution studies of the galaxy outside the inner few hundred parsecs are uncommon , since most of the imaging has been of small fields centered on the main starburst disk .",
    "one recent study on the larger scale is that of @xcite , who used rosat to identify 73 x - ray sources in the bulge , disk , and halo of ngc  253 , attributing most of them to x - ray binary stars . to study the population of compact radio sources on this large scale",
    ", we have reprocessed the high - resolution 6-cm and 20-cm very large array ( vla ) data obtained in 1987 @xcite in order to image the entire primary beam of the individual vla antennas at high resolution ; limited computing resources prevented this from being done at the time of the observations . in this paper , we report the locations of the compact radio sources outside the inner 200-pc starburst , compare these locations to images made in other wavebands , and estimate the supernova rate outside the inner disk .",
    "the observations of ngc  253 that we use here were made in 1987 , using the vla @xcite in its a configuration .",
    "results from imaging the inner starburst at 6  cm ( 4860  mhz ) were reported by @xcite , while the 20-cm ( 1490  mhz ) image of the same region was discussed briefly by @xcite .",
    "details of the observations were reported in those papers .",
    "other 6-cm observations had much poorer ( _ u , v _ ) coverage than those made in 1987 , so only the 1987 data are considered here .    for self - consistency ,",
    "the data were re - calibrated and self - calibrated using the same procedures reported previously .",
    "we then made large - scale ( @xmath7 pixels ) images of the radio emission of ngc  253 to reveal the compact radio sources seen throughout the primary beam of the individual 25-m telescopes of the vla .",
    "these images covered @xmath8 at 20  cm and @xmath9 at 6  cm . outside the starburst disk , confusion was not a significant issue , but sensitivity was critical .",
    "we therefore used natural weighting of the data in the ( _ u , v _ ) plane @xcite ; this scheme produces the maximum sensitivity , at the price of a modest loss in resolution .",
    "a zero - spacing ( total ) flux density was specified in the imaging , in order to partially compensate for the lack of short interferometer spacings .",
    "this reduced , but did not completely remove , systematic effects caused by diffuse emission that was not sampled well in our observations .",
    "table  [ tab : obssum ] gives the resolution and the r.m.s .",
    "noise achieved for the final images .",
    "several effects contribute to reductions in the sensitivity far from the field center ; each is discussed briefly here .",
    "first , the attenuation of the primary beam of the individual vla antennas reduces the sensitivity by more than 10% at 6  cm and 20  cm for respective distances from the pointing direction of greater than @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "corrections for this attenuation were made using the aips @xcite software developed by nrao , and were less than 10% except for several sources ( see section  [ background ] ) far from the main area of radio emission . a second effect , chromatic aberration ( `` bandwidth smearing '' ) due to the non - zero observing bandwidth @xcite , is more deleterious .",
    "it reduces the peak flux density by more than a factor of two at distances greater than 2  from the phase center , and is progressively worse farther out in the field .",
    "the actual phase center of the observations was @xmath12 north of the apparent galaxy nucleus , at a b1950 position of @xmath13 ; since most of the large - scale sources are north of the nucleus , this actually was slightly beneficial in the final data analysis . compared to the chromatic aberration , the reduction in flux density due to delay smearing @xcite over the observations 10-second averaging period is negligible .",
    "finally , the lack of short interferometer spacings causes correlated positive or negative emission as high as 0.080.1  mjy over areas of @xmath14 pixels away from the center of the field .",
    "the final source detection threshold that was used was four times the quadrature sum of this systematic value and the r.m.s .",
    "noise , or approximately 0.4  mjy at each wavelength .",
    "however , this threshold rises substantially at distances more than a few arcminutes from the phase center .",
    "figure  [ lbig ] is a portion of the 20-cm image showing the circumnuclear region of ngc  253 at high resolution .",
    "the locations of compact x - ray sources detected by @xcite , using the rosat high resolution imager , are shown as crosses whose sizes indicate the errors in the x - ray positions .",
    "we have identified all radio sources that have apparent peak flux densities of at least 0.4  mjy  beam@xmath4 at either 6  cm or 20  cm , outside the central 200-pc starburst .",
    "figures  [ close]a and [ close]b are respective enlargements of the 20-cm and 6-cm images showing the radio emission from the 200-pc starburst disk and its surroundings , including a number of the circumnuclear compact sources .",
    "note that the 6-cm image shows little detail , due to the larger number of beam areas needed to cover the given region , but it does serve to illustrate the relative locations of the detected sources .",
    "table  [ tab : sor ] lists the source identifications in the circumnuclear region at the two wavelengths .",
    "( each source listed in this table can be seen in the region shown in figure  [ lbig ] . )",
    "included are the source positions , flux densities at 6  cm and 20  cm , measured sizes , and a few comments .",
    "when compact sources are identified at both wavelengths , the higher resolution 6-cm position is quoted ; typical position accuracies are @xmath15@xmath16 . at 6  cm ,",
    "flux densities as low as 0.2  mjy are given for sources that meet the 0.4-mjy threshold at 20  cm , but these flux densities have very large fractional errors .",
    "source flux densities and sizes have been derived by making gaussian fits to the individual sources in the image plane , and confirmed by integrating over the region of significant emission .",
    "most sources are unresolved in the full - resolution images at both 6  cm and 20  cm , as indicated by a `` u '' in the table",
    ". the sizes of resolved sources are derived from the 6-cm full - resolution image .",
    "the total 6-cm flux densities and approximate sizes found at full resolution generally are consistent with values found from a 6-cm image tapered to the 20-cm resolution .",
    "we estimated flux density errors due to several causes .",
    "first , the areas of apparent systematic negative or positive flux near the main starburst disk , caused by undersampling in the aperture plane , average as much as 0.08  mjy  beam@xmath4 at 6  cm and 0.10  mjy  beam@xmath4 at 20  cm ; this offset is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "second , there is a @xmath18% error in the absolute flux density scales of each of the two maps , so @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the source flux density .",
    "third , there is a fitting error , @xmath21 , caused by confusion with underlying diffuse emission and uncertainties in the source fits .",
    "since the newly identified sources reported here are outside the main starburst disk and fairly well isolated , we take the confusion error to be negligible , so @xmath21 is simply the uncertainty reported by the least - squares fitting program .",
    "this value includes the r.m.s .",
    "noise given in table  [ tab : obssum ] , so the noise is not included separately .",
    "we combine these errors in quadrature to get the total flux - density error , @xmath22 , using @xmath23 thus , the total flux - density error for a 0.4-mjy source is typically 0.09  mjy at 6  cm and 0.11  mjy at 20  cm .",
    "there are 22 sources above the 0.4-mjy limit at 20  cm , inside a box 4  ( 2.8  kpc ) on a side and centered on the nucleus of ngc  253 .",
    "the density of background sources above this flux - density threshold is expected to be @xmath24  sr@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect about one background source stronger than 0.4  mjy within a field of 16 square arcminutes , implying that almost all of the detected sources are associated with ngc  253 . the apparent lack of weak sources at greater distances from the nucleus may be caused primarily by chromatic aberration ( see section  [ obs ] ) ; sources far from the phase center of the observation have their peak flux densities reduced substantially , and therefore may fall below the detection threshold .",
    "observations using narrow spectral - line channels rather than a broadband continuum would be needed to determine whether other weak compact sources exist farther from the phase center .",
    "five additional sources were detected at 20  cm within an area 12  on a side , centered on ngc  253 , and are listed in table  [ tab : back ] .",
    "these are within the size of the optical galaxy , which has a measured diameter of 25  to 25th magnitude @xcite",
    ". images of these sources are not shown , since they are substantially degraded by chromatic aberration , which prevents measurement of the source sizes .",
    "therefore , only the total flux densities are given in table  [ tab : back ] .",
    "the source locations are best seen in previous lower - resolution radio images of ngc  253 , particularly that published by @xcite , though none of those images resolves source b2 into the three components distinguished here .",
    "only sources much stronger than 0.4  mjy can be detected in the large region due to the chromatic aberration .",
    "the expected density of sources stronger than 15  mjy at 20  cm is @xmath25  sr@xmath4 @xcite , so we expect to detect less than one background source above this threshold .",
    "source b3 appears to be associated with a `` spur '' noted by @xcite , and the three - component source b2 lies along the large - scale galaxy disk , making it probable that at least b2 and b3 are associated with ngc  253 .",
    "the detected circumnuclear sources ( table  [ tab : sor ] ) outside the central starburst have typical flux densities of 0.43  mjy at 6  cm and 20  cm , corresponding to radio powers of @xmath26 to @xmath27  w  hz@xmath4 .",
    "most of them seem to have relatively steep spectra ; for a source with a flux density of 0.4  mjy at 6  cm and a spectral index of @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 ) , the total luminosity between 10  mhz ( or 100  mhz ) and 100  ghz is @xmath30  erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "this luminosity is a factor of 1001000 lower than the luminosities of the point x - ray sources detected by @xcite , which they generally attribute to x - ray binaries .",
    "since none of the radio sources listed in table  [ tab : sor ] coincides with a compact x - ray source , the radio emission is probably not associated with evolved binaries .    in the main 200-pc starburst disk of ngc  253",
    ", @xcite deduced that @xmath31 compact radio sources exist . a supernova rate of @xmath32  yr@xmath4 was estimated from the radio emission @xcite , while supernova rates of 0.10.3  yr@xmath4 have been derived on other grounds @xcite . here , we report an additional 22 circumnuclear compact radio sources that lie outside the central 200-pc starburst , but within 2  kpc ( 170 ) of the galaxy center .",
    "since they do not coincide with x - ray binaries , and most are less than 510  pc ( @xmath33@xmath34 ) in diameter , they most likely are due to supernova remnants and 2 regions , as are the sources in the nuclear region .",
    "the sources can be compared to the galactic supernova remnant cas  a. for an assumed distance of 2.8  kpc @xcite and a flux density of @xmath35  jy @xcite , cas  a has a 6-cm radio power of @xmath36  w",
    "hz@xmath4 , comparable to the powers of the weaker circumnuclear sources in ngc  253 .    there are 1015  circumnuclear sources with steep radio spectra , likely to be supernova remnants .",
    "the number of steep - spectrum sources is uncertain because some are too weak for good spectral - index determination .",
    "in addition , since the ( _ u , v _ ) coverage at 6  cm is not matched to that at 20  cm , more flux density may be `` resolved out '' at 6  cm , which could lead to estimates of spectra that are overly steep .",
    "( this resolution effect is the primary reason that spectral indices are not quoted in table  [ tab : sor ] . ) by comparison , there are at least 32 steep - spectrum sources in the inner 200-pc starburst @xcite ; correcting for confusion would probably increase this number to 50 or more . if the circumnuclear radio sources have the same general character as those in the main starburst disk , a simple comparison with the analysis of @xcite indicates that the estimated circumnuclear supernova rate outside the central starburst is @xmath37  yr@xmath4 .",
    "( of course , some sources outside the strong starburst could have been missed , due primarily to chromatic aberration . ) in any case , based solely on the ratio of steep - spectrum sources inside and outside the 200-pc starburst , we infer that at least 20%30% of the global star - formation and supernova remnants are outside that central starburst .",
    "no supernovae have been detected in the circumnuclear region during limited searches made at optical wavelengths in 19881991 @xcite , and at near - infrared wavelengths in late 1993 @xcite .",
    "however , such searches did not cover long enough time periods to expect supernova detections in ngc  253 , and also could have been affected by obscuration and confusion .",
    "figure  [ blowup ] shows a complex of sources to the west of the main starburst disk , roughly 800  pc from the galaxy nucleus .",
    "figure  [ blowup]a is the 20-cm image , showing four individual radio sources . these sources are numbered 4 , 6 , 7 , and 8 in table  [ tab : sor ] and similarly labeled in the figure .",
    "two 6-cm images also are shown .",
    "figure  [ blowup]b is an image for which the visibility data were tapered and then restored with a point - spread function identical to that at 20  cm , while figure  [ blowup]c is a full - resolution image . inspection of table  [ tab : sor ] reveals that the two strongest 6-cm sources shown in figure  [ blowup]b have flat or inverted spectra . summing the four individual compact sources",
    "gives a total 6-cm flux density of @xmath38  mjy and a total 20-cm flux density of @xmath39  mjy , while integration of the images over the region of figure  [ blowup ] yields a total 6-cm flux density of 7.7  mjy and a total 20-cm flux density of 9.0  mjy , slightly higher than the fits to the compact sources .",
    "we take the somewhat simplistic step of making a two - component decomposition of the flux density in the radio sources shown in figure  [ blowup ] . to do so",
    ", we assume the presence of a thermal , flat - spectrum component having @xmath40 , and a nonthermal , steep - spectrum component due to supernova remnants .",
    "the steep - spectrum sources in the inner starburst of ngc  253 have typical spectral indices of @xmath41 @xcite , while galactic supernova remnants have a median spectral index of @xmath42 @xcite , so there is some range in the estimates of the flat - spectrum component .",
    "the simple spectral decomposition gives thermal radio emission containing 5.3 to 5.9  mjy out of a total of 6.6  mjy at 6  cm , for a steep - spectrum component having a spectral index ranging from @xmath43 to @xmath28 .",
    "thus , 80% to 90% of the 6-cm flux density in the region shown in figure  [ blowup ] appears to be thermal in origin .",
    "the natural conclusion is that the flat - spectrum radio component is thermal radiation from 2 regions energized by young stars .",
    "applying the analysis of the strongest flat - spectrum source in the starburst disk , which was described by @xcite , we find that the equivalent of @xmath44  o5 stars is necessary to energize the radio emission within a region of about @xmath45 ( @xmath46  pc ) .",
    "this is comparable to the number of young stars needed to account for the strongest thermal source in the inner starburst , but those stars are contained in a volume @xmath47 times higher .",
    "therefore , the average thermal gas density in the 130-pc region shown in figure  [ blowup ] is @xmath48  @xmath5 , much lower than the values of @xmath25  @xmath5 found in the dense part of the inner starburst of ngc  253 @xcite and in ngc  5253 @xcite , or of @xmath49  @xmath5 for the typical thermal radio sources in ngc  4038/4039 @xcite .",
    "few high - resolution observations at other wavelengths are available for the region shown in figure  [ blowup ] .",
    "however , a moderate - resolution ( @xmath50 ) vla image @xcite shows a source at the same location , with an apparent 3.6-cm flux density between 5 and 6  mjy .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the value expected for for the flat - spectrum component deduced above .",
    "near - infrared images shown in figures  1 and 10 of @xcite indicate a slight enhancement in k ( 2.2  @xmath51 m ) at the location of the complex of compact radio sources , apparently along an inner spiral arm .",
    "this infrared source may represent a highly reddened set of 2 regions containing the numerous young stars that energize the local radio complex .",
    "a similar argument can be made for source 15 , which lies nearly 2  kpc from the galaxy nucleus , and also appears to have a thermal spectrum .",
    "ionization of this radio source requires the equivalent of about 35  o5 stars in a region about 1530  pc in diameter , and an average ionized density near 200  @xmath5 .",
    "chromatic aberration makes these estimates somewhat uncertain , but they should be correct to 50% or better .",
    "the relatively low average densities derived for the two strongest thermal - emitting complexes in the circumnuclear region imply that they contain more `` normal '' star formation , rather than the intense starbursts characteristic of the central 200  parsecs .",
    "the number and the density of massive young stars are significantly higher than in orion and other nearby galactic o - b associations @xcite , and may be comparable to the richest star - forming regions in our galaxy , such as w49 @xcite",
    ". however , the intensity of massive star formation is considerably lower than in 30  doradus @xcite or in the super star clusters seen in a number of starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "we have used archival vla data to image the circumnuclear region of ngc  253 at arcsecond resolution .",
    "twenty - two compact radio sources have been found in the inner 2  kpc of the galaxy , but outside the well - known 200-pc disk , and most of these are probably associated with regions of recent star formation .",
    "the supernova rate inferred outside the central starburst is @xmath30.1  yr@xmath4 ; this may be a slight underestimate due to the decreasing sensitivity of the radio observations at distances more than @xmath1  from the nucleus .",
    "therefore , the region outside the well - studied inner starburst seems to account for a significant fraction of the recent star formation in ngc  253 .",
    "a collection of sources located 800  pc to the west of the nucleus appears to be a complex of 2 regions energized by the equivalent of 70  o5 stars , but with an average ionized gas density @xmath49 times lower than that found in the inner starburst of the galaxy .",
