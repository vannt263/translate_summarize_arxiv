    "anisotropic lattices whose temporal lattice spacing @xmath1 is finer than the spatial one @xmath2 have become a powerful tool in various subjects of lattice qcd simulations . among these applications , computations of heavy - light matrix elements @xcite",
    "require the most accurate parameter tuning , which should be performed nonperturbatively . in this paper",
    ", we report the status of our project to develop the anisotropic lattice framework for such precision computations with accuracy of a few percent level @xcite .    here",
    "we briefly summarize our strategy . for precise computations of heavy - light matrix elements ,",
    "we need a framework of the heavy quark in which one should be able to ( i ) take the continuum limit , ( ii ) compute the parameters in the action and the operators nonperturbatively , ( iii ) and compute the matrix elements with a modest computational cost .",
    "the anisotropic lattice is a candidate of such framework , if a method which fulfills the above condition ( ii ) is provided .",
    "our expectation is that on anisotropic lattices the mass dependence of the parameters becomes so mild that one can adopt coefficients determined nonperturbatively at massless limit .",
    "we also need to control all the systematic errors in the continuum extrapolations .",
    "feasibility studies performed so far for the level of @xmath3 computations are encouraging for further development @xcite .",
    "we therefore investigate calibration procedures at the accuracy less than one percent , both for the gauge and quark actions in the quenched approximation at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "to achieve a few percent accuracy in the final results , the tuning of parameters must be performed at much less than this accuracy . as the goal of present work",
    ", we intend to determine the anisotropy parameters at @xmath5 level",
    ". the elaborated work by klassen @xcite , the @xmath6 level calibration for the wilson action , is therefore no longer meets the present condition . for more precise calibration of the gauge field",
    ", we need to measure the static quark potential very accurately . for this purpose",
    ", we adopt the lscher - weisz noise reduction technique @xcite as well as the standard smearing technique while applied in the anisotropic plane .",
    "the former method can drastically reduce the statistical errors while requires larger memory resources than the latter .",
    "we define the renormalized anisotropy @xmath7 through the hadronic radii @xmath8 measured in the coarse and fine directions . since we carry out the continuum extrapolation in terms of the lattice scale set by @xmath8 , the renormalized anisotropy is kept fixed during the extrapolation .",
    "this avoids the systematic uncertainties due to the anisotropy which may remain in the continuum limit .",
    "figure  [ fig : gauge1 ] shows a result of calibration at @xmath9 .",
    "the top panel shows the result for the static potential determined with the lscher - weisz technique at @xmath10 .",
    "the renormalized anisotropy @xmath7 is determined with 0.2% accuracy",
    ". a linear fit of the results at several values of @xmath11 determines @xmath12 for which @xmath13 holds with 0.2% accuracy as displayed in the bottom panel .    in figure",
    "[ fig : gauge2 ] , the results at several values of @xmath14 are collected .",
    "although the precisions of the result with potential determined with the standard smearing technique are still not enough , sufficient precision is achieved at @xmath15 where we used the l - w method .",
    "improvement of calculation at @xmath16 and global fit analysis are in progress .",
    "our heavy quark formulation basically follows the fermilab approach @xcite but is formulated on the anisotropic lattices @xcite . the quark action is represented as @xmath17   \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\hspace{-0.2 cm }      -   \\kappa_{\\sigma } { \\textstyle \\sum_{i } }           \\left [ \\ \\ ( r-\\gamma_i ) u_i(x ) \\delta_{x+\\hat{i},y } \\right .",

    "the four parameters @xmath24 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 should be tuned .",
    "we can set @xmath25 without loss of generality @xcite .",
    "we must calibrate @xmath26 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 to the level which enables computations of matrix elements within a few percent accuracy .",
    "we also need to perform the nonperturbative renormalization of the operators such as the heavy - light axial current .",
    "the nonperturbative renormalization technique @xcite is one of the most powerful methods to perform such a program .",
    "following our strategy , this technique can also be applied with a little modification for the anisotropic lattice .",
    "we perform the calibration of @xmath26 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and the renormalization coefficients of the axial current along the following steps .",
    "( 1 ) tuning of @xmath21 by schrdinger functional method . ( 2 ) calibration of @xmath26 ( and @xmath22 if possible ) by requiring the physical isotropy conditions for @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the coarse and fine directions on lattices with @xmath29,@xmath30 @xmath31 2 fm .",
    "( 3 ) determination of @xmath22 , @xmath32 and the renormalization coefficients of the axial current by schrdinger functional method .",
    "we also need to verify that the systematic errors are under control by calculating the hadron spectra and the dispersion relations and by taking the continuum limit .",
    "it is also necessary to verify that the tuned parameters in the massless limit is also available in the heavy quark mass region .    to verify the feasibility of the step ( 1 ) , we determine @xmath21 with fixed values of @xmath26 and @xmath22 . at @xmath33 , the method is successfully applicable , and the result for @xmath21 is close to the 1-loop mean - field value .",
    "figure [ fig : quark1 ] shows the result at @xmath34 ( @xmath35 gev ) .",
    "the tuned value of @xmath21 is obtained as the value at which @xmath36 , the difference of the quark mass defined through the axial ward identity under different kinematical conditions , vanishes up to @xmath37 effects .",
    "the result of @xmath21 is larger than the tadpole improved tree level value .",
    "it is also found that @xmath36 is not sensitive to the change of @xmath22 .",
    "figure [ fig : quark2 ] shows the result for the step ( 2 ) at @xmath9 on a @xmath38 lattice .",
    "the values of @xmath39 is determined from the meson masses in the fine and coarse directions .",
    "we note that the result for @xmath40 is consistent with that from the dispersion relation @xcite . at this stage , the precision of @xmath40 is still not sufficient , while several techniques to reduce the statistical noise are yet to be tested . for the determination of @xmath22 ,",
    "the ratio of the hyperfine splittings in the fine and coarse directions is not feasible because of large statistical noise .",
    "other procedures , such as schrdinger functional method with boundaries in the coarse direction , are under investigation .",
