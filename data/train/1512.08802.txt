    "we examine the same riemann - hilbert problem via the modern dbar method , introduced by miller and mclaughlin in @xcite and @xcite . in particular , we establish a better estimate of @xmath15 for a larger class of initial data . our main result is the following    [ hauptsatz ] let the reflection coefficient @xmath14 associated to the initial datum @xmath16 belong to @xmath17 , for some integer @xmath18 .",

    "these ones can be easily employed for a more detailed , long time asymptotic expansion including higher order corrections .",
