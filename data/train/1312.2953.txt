    "gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences are expected to be detected in the coming decade by second - generation gravitational - wave detectors like advanced ligo , advanced virgo , and kagra @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves will give us a way to infer masses and spins of binary components , and also equations of state for supranuclear - density matter if the binary involves a neutron star .",
    "in addition to these intrinsic parameters , extrinsic parameters such as the luminosity distance and sky position of the binary can also be studied by gravitational - wave observation .",
    "once we localize a compact binary coalescence in the sky to the extent that the host galaxy is determined , the luminosity distance will be known as a function of the cosmological redshift so that a new distance ladder may be constructed @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic counterparts of compact binary coalescences are also important at this stage @xcite , because seeing them is more advantageous for accurate localization than hearing gravitational waves .",
    "one ambitious goal of gravitational - wave astronomy is to sound a merger alert before the merger sets in .",
    "the benefit of realtime electromagnetic observation of the compact binary merger will be immeasurable .",
    "nearly simultaneous detection of gravitational and electromagnetic waves will give us an opportunity to investigate the propagation speed of gravitational waves as sn 1987a did for neutrinos @xcite .",
    "realtime observation of the merger is also useful to understand electromagnetic radiation mechanisms .",
    "if short - hard gamma - ray bursts are driven by compact binary coalescences ( see @xcite and references therein for reviews ) , we will be able to detect prompt emission from the beginning in various wavelengths for face - on compact binaries .",
    "recent possible ` kilonova ' detection supports this binary merger scenario of the short - hard gamma - ray burst @xcite , and we can reasonably expect simultaneous detection with gravitational waves . still , direct connection between the short - hard gamma - ray bursts and gravitational waves is essential for the robust confirmation of the scenario .",
    "the onset of afterglow will be observed following the prompt emission .",
    "extended emission observed in the afterglow is one of the most mysterious feature of the short - hard gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. @xcite ) , and detailed characteristics including its opening angle will be investigated if a merger alert could be sounded .",
    "other electromagnetic events involving ultrarelativistic outflows , such as a proposed shock breakout emission from binary neutron star mergers @xcite , are also easier to detect with realtime observation .",
    "besides the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , localization of the gravitational - wave source up to moderate accuracy is necessary for successful follow - up detection of electromagnetic counterparts @xcite , and thus pre - merger localization should be regarded as a prerequisite for generating merger alerts . pointing only known galaxies using available catalogues will help to detect electromagnetic counterparts particularly in the early era of gravitational - wave astronomy @xcite .",
    "still , assuming the number density of galaxies to be 0.01 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath2 8 galaxies per deg@xmath1 will be found if we are going to observe out to @xmath2 200 mpc .",
    "thus , accurate localization is eagerly desired irrespective of our follow - up strategy .",
    "detection and localization of circular binaries on the celestial sphere prior to the merger are challenging tasks @xcite , whereas such binaries will be the most frequent sources and are extensively studied .",
    "the reason for this is that a circular binary has the largest periapsis distance for a fixed value of the semimajor axis , and the luminosity averaged over an orbit is the lowest among possible configurations .",
    "furthermore , gravitational - wave frequency is only twice the orbital frequency within the quadrupole approximation .",
    "the localization of gravitational - wave sources is primarily based on triangulation via the timing difference between detectors @xcite .",
    "typical separations of ground - based detectors determine typical timing differences @xmath4 ms , and thus accurate localization requires gravitational waves with frequency higher than @xmath5 hz .",
    "but , the gravitational - wave frequency from 1.4@xmath6 binary neutron stars in a circular orbit does not reach 10 hz until @xmath2 1000 s before the merger , and reaches 100 hz only at @xmath2 2 s before the merger . as a result",
    ", the area of the 90 per cent localization confidence will be larger than 100 deg@xmath1 even 1 s before the merger for typical events @xcite .",
    "moreover , the snr does not substantially accumulate until gravitational - wave frequency reaches @xmath2 100 hz , because each detector is sensitive around 100 hz .",
    "taking a few to 10 min of latency associated with trigger and alert generation into account @xcite , it would be challenging to sound merger alerts with second - generation detector networks even if we could omit human validation processes .",
    "furthermore , practical target - of - opportunity observation will involve overheads of telescopes and satellites as additional latency sources .",
    "the situation could be changed for eccentric compact binary coalescences ( e.g. @xcite ) , which emit higher mode gravitational waves even within the quadrupole approximation @xcite .",
    "event rates of eccentric compact binary coalescences are conceivably low , and several authors investigated this possibility .",
    "note that the horizon distance @xmath2 200 mpc of a single detector is not changed drastically by the presence of a finite eccentricity unless the binary is formed with an extremely short periapsis distance as we discuss later .",
    "@xcite studied the formation of very hard eccentric binaries via tidal - interaction induced captures in globular clusters focusing on nearly direct collisions .",
    "they found that the local formation rate of binary neutron stars may be a few tens gpc@xmath3 yr@xmath7 depending on globular cluster models .",
    "although this rate is motivating for ground - based detectors , @xcite pointed out that this might be an order - of - magnitude overestimation caused by assuming extremely high retention fraction of neutron stars ( see also @xcite ) . at the same time",
    ", @xcite also pointed out that the cross - section of gravitational - wave induced captures is larger than that of the tidal - interaction ones by an order of magnitude . indeed , whereas the tidal capture requires the initial periapsis distance to be smaller than @xmath8@xmath9 for binary neutron stars with the total mass @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the gravitational constant and speed of light , respectively @xcite , the gravitational - wave capture can work up to @xmath13@xmath14 irrespective of the binary components @xcite .",
    "thus , the merger rate of eccentric binary neutron stars could be @xmath2 1 yr@xmath7 within the sensitive volume of second - generation gravitational - wave detectors . here",
    ", we would not say that such eccentric compact binary coalescences are frequent enough , because the rate estimation is not settled . instead",
    ", we consider that they can be possible events and should not be completely neglected in the gravitational - wave data analysis .",
    "note that an eccentric binary formed with a very large periapsis distance @xmath15 essentially circularizes before gravitational waves are detected , where the distribution of @xmath15 is expected to be flat below @xmath16 from the fact that the capture cross - section is proportional to @xmath15 .    in this paper",
    ", we explore a possibility of realtime detection and localization of moderately eccentric compact binary coalescences . here , we use the word ` moderately eccentric ' to state that the binary is eccentric during a detectable inspiral phase , and circularized to a low value of eccentricity , say @xmath17 , when it reaches the last stable orbit . in such cases ,",
    "the remnant of the merger and associated electromagnetic counterparts are expected to be more similar to those of circular compact binary coalescences than those of direct collisions .",
    "we only focus on equal - mass , 1.4@xmath0 binary neutron stars in this study , and our result depends only weakly on the total mass and mass ratio once effects of the eccentricity are properly normalized with respect to the chirp mass .",
    "we always assume that binary components are treated as non - spinning point particles up to the last stable orbit , while the exact merger is determined by the radius of neutron stars .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : evolution ] , we briefly summarize the orbital evolution of eccentric binaries .",
    "next , in section [ sec : analysis ] , our formalism to evaluate the snr , timing accuracy , and localization accuracy is described .",
    "results are shown in section [ sec : result ] , and section [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to the summary and discussion .",
    "we denote masses of each component by @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the total mass and reduced mass are written by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the distance to the binary from the earth ( or solar system barycentre ) is written by @xmath22 . the semimajor axis and eccentricity of the binary",
    "are denoted by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "we describe the motion of an eccentric binary with @xmath23 and @xmath24 in newtonian gravity , and consider gravitational radiation in terms of quadrupole formula . the orbital frequency as the inverse of the period is given by @xmath25 and gravitational waves are decomposed into harmonic modes with frequency @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of each harmonic mode averaged over an orbit is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is given by equation 20 of @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath30 and the total luminosity averaged over an orbit @xmath31 , which governs the orbital evolution , is given in terms of @xmath32 .",
    "time evolution of an eccentric binary due to radiation reaction is handled following @xcite in this study .",
    "specifically , we use the eccentricity , @xmath24 , as the independent variable , and describe all quantities including the time to the merger as functions of @xmath24 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are derived under the assumption of adiabatic evolution according to @xcite , whereas the actual evolution may be more discontinuous due to the pulse - like nature of gravitational waves from a highly eccentric binary .",
    "this approximation may require sophistication once we are going to prepare waveform templates , and we do not expect that it changes the story as far as pulse - like gravitational - wave trains are emitted .",
    "the periapsis distance is given by @xmath33 , and we introduce a normalized periapsis distance @xmath34 for convenience .",
    "we further introduce an initial normalized periapsis distance at @xmath35 as @xmath36 .",
    "although realistic binaries should be formed with an eccentricity smaller than unity , we consider the evolution of a binary from @xmath35 as an approximation .",
    "this approximation can be relaxed by evolving a binary from a realistic initial value at @xmath37 , but we do not take this step so that the formation process is kept unspecified .",
    "the change of quantities such as snrs associated with setting @xmath38 is negligible due to its proximity to unity if we assume gravitational - wave induced captures ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ecc ] ) .",

    ", more than 10 orbits are always expected as far as the binary is formed with @xmath49 .",

    "we extend the snr to a function of our time variable , i.e. eccentricity . using a relation @xmath60 , the realtime snr for the _ _ n__th harmonic mode is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the realtime total snr is given by @xmath64 and thus , the relation between the snr @xmath65 and time to the merger @xmath66 is given in a parametrized form . in a practical numerical computation , we truncate the summation at @xmath67 with which 0.1 per cent accuracy is expected to be achieved @xcite .",
    "the realtime snr obtains its full value at the last stable orbit as @xmath68 .",
    "because @xmath69 diverges at @xmath35 , we have to approximate the integral at @xmath70 .",
    "using the fact that gravitational - wave pulses emitted at @xmath70 are approximately identical , we replace the gravitational - wave luminosity distribution over harmonic modes at any value of @xmath24 larger than a prescribed value @xmath71 by that at @xmath72 , as well as the representative frequency for each harmonic mode .",
    "this gives @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the energy radiated between @xmath35 and @xmath75 .",
    "we typically set @xmath76 , and the error associated with this approximation is at most 0.1 per cent , thus negligible .",
    "this is because the radiated energy is very small in the relevant regime .",
    "another way to avoid this divergence is to introduce realistic initial values , @xmath77 .      for a circular binary ,",
    "the timing accuracy is often approximated by inverting a two - dimensional fisher information matrix for the reference time @xmath78 and phase @xmath79 ( e.g. the coalescence time and phase ) neglecting the correlation with other parameters @xcite .",
    "on one hand , it is known that the amplitude and polarization information of gravitational waves in each detector improve the localization accuracy @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    ", the timing triangulation approximation with timing accuracy obtained by the two - dimensional model is found to underestimate the localization accuracy by a factor of @xmath2 4 compared to that obtained by fully bayesian analysis for all the parameters including the sky position at realistic snrs @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we evaluate the timing accuracy simply by a one - dimensional model in which the correlation between the time and all the other parameters are neglected for both circular and eccentric binaries . in the terminology of the fisher matrix ,",
    "the timing accuracy is estimated as @xmath80 using the fisher matrix component with respect to the reference time .",
    "we find that the timing accuracy estimated in this one - dimensional model is exactly the same as the result of a two - dimensional , time - and - phase model for an eccentric binary formed with @xmath35 .",
    "this owes to the divergence of the fisher matrix component @xmath81 with respect to the reference phase in the limit of @xmath82 .",
    "the correlation term @xmath83 vanishes in this limit .",
    "even if the realistic initial eccentricity @xmath84 is slightly less than unity , our results are essentially unchanged as the divergence @xmath85 is rapid ( see appendix [ app : div ] ) . on another front , @xcite",
    "show for a circular binary that this approximation gives overestimated accuracy by a factor of @xmath2 2 than fully bayesian analysis , and thus , we assume this as an approximate upper limit .",
    "these facts imply that the contrast between localization properties of eccentric and circular binaries elucidated by our one - dimensional model is expected to be a conservative estimation .",
    "the reason of the exquisite accuracy for the reference phase of eccentric binaries is the different morphology of gravitational waves .",
    "the gravitational waveform of circular binaries is usually called as a chirp signal , in which only a nearly sinusoidal @xmath86 mode is emitted with increasing amplitude and frequency throughout their lifetimes within the quadrupole approximation .",
    "the matched filtering for this case is essentially a problem of matching the phase evolution .",
    "by contrast , gravitational waves from eccentric binaries with @xmath70 are considered as a sequence of nearly identical pulses emitted around the periapsis , or repeated bursts @xcite . in this case , the matched filtering may be considered as a problem of finding the arrival time of pulse peaks displaced by decreasing orbital periods .",
    "the pulse width is approximately constant at @xmath70 , whereas the orbital period diverges at @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the orbital phase is determined accurately to be the periapsis when the pulses are observed .",
    "the fisher matrix component for the reference time is obtained using the fact that the _ n_-th harmonic mode gravitational waves are proportional to @xmath87 $ ] in the frequency domain .",
    "it is given by @xmath88 where the _ _",

    "the relation between the timing accuracy @xmath95 and time to the merger @xmath66 is given in a parametrized form in a similar manner to that between the snr and timing accuracy .    as already noted , the caveat of this model is that it relies on the fisher analysis , which breaks down at the low snr regime .",
    "unfortunately , we are always interested in the low snr regime as far as our aim is to sound a merger alert as early as possible .",
    "comparisons with the fully bayesian analysis are conducted in @xcite for a circular binary , but they have never been done for an eccentric binary . furthermore , the validity in the very low snr regime required for pre - merger localization is not checked even for circular binaries .",
    "thus , the fisher analysis could be a poorer approximation in realistic data analysis for pre - merger localization of eccentric binaries than expected from the previous study of a circular binary .",
    "we left more quantitative analysis such as the fully bayesian one for the future study .",
    "we follow @xcite to estimate localization ability of a detector network .",
    "localization accuracy depends on a particular configuration of the detector network . in this study , we focus on a four - detector network composed of advanced ligo hanford , advanced ligo livingston , advanced virgo , and kagra , whereas the expression below is not limited to this particular network .",
    "we also consider a five - detector network composed of the mentioned four detectors and ligo india .",
    "their locations are taken from @xcite .",
    "the antenna pattern functions and noise curves will be different among the detectors , but we adopt the same value of @xmath95 at all the detectors for simplicity . while we have not critically assessed the deviation from realistic values due to this approximation , we believe that our result is sufficient to elucidate the effect of eccentricity semiquantitatively , partly because @xmath95 is derived by averaging over the sky position and orientation of the binary .",
    "once locations of detectors and timing accuracy at them are determined , the inverse covariance matrix associated with the probability distribution of the sky position is given by @xcite @xmath96 here , lowercase latin indices denote three - dimensional coordinates , and we do not restrict the estimated source position to be on the celestial sphere at this stage .",

    "this increase of the snr at moderately large @xmath36 is primarily ascribed to the fact that the radiated energy tends to concentrate around sensitive frequency of a particular detector configuration .",

    "post - newtonian corrections such as the periastron precession and spin - orbit interaction have to be taken into account for more quantitative study and actual data analysis @xcite , although theoretical templates of gravitational waves from eccentric compact binary coalescences are not developed very much compared to those for circular ones ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "tidal effects due to the finite size of neutron stars , such as the excitation of _ f_-mode oscillation , will also become important at some stage of the orbital evolution @xcite .",
    "we expect that these issues modify our conclusion only quantitatively , because the repeated pulse - like waveform at the early stage of inspiral is conserved .",
    "another assuring point is that the waveform near the merger is irrelevant to the purpose of the pre - merger localization and merger alert , and thus higher order post - newtonian and tidal effects should be safely neglected .",
    "as stated repeatedly , discontinuous orbital evolution in the high - eccentricity regime will require more careful consideration .",
    "the timing triangulation approximation adopted in this study relies on the fisher analysis , and it inevitably breaks down when we try to sound a merger alert using low snr gravitational waves from a binary long before the merger .",
    "a detailed study such as monte carlo simulations is necessary to assess quantitatively the ability to localize the gravitational - wave source before the merger with low snr signals .",
    "one important difference of the eccentric waveform from the circular one is the introduction of a new degree of freedom , which may be expressed as the angle of the periapsis direction @xcite .",
    "the correlation between this angle and timing accuracy has to be investigated quantitatively , whereas we expect that the timing accuracy primarily depends on the pulse - like waveform structure .",
    "in addition , a common value of the timing accuracy ( and snr ) is adopted for all the detectors to derive the localization accuracy , and this approximation requires improvement",
    ".    a challenging task will be the matched filtering analysis for long - term gravitational - wave pulse sequences ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in a pipeline of initial ligo - virgo data analysis , detector output data are usually split into 256 s segments @xcite .",
    "this will be lengthened in a pipeline of second - generation detectors , which are sensitive at lower frequency .",
    "the required segment length will be , however , much longer for eccentric binaries than for circular binaries if we try to process all the available information , because eccentric binaries emit detectable gravitational waves during their early lives with very low orbital frequency ( see the end of section [ sec : evolution ] ) .",
    "one way to overcome this is to develop a longer pipeline specialized to eccentric compact binary coalescences .",
    "the rotation of the earth will not be negligible with this strategy .",
    "another way is to choose an appropriate time interval from the entire lifetime of an eccentric binary for a given length of the segment .",
    "the large number of harmonic modes can be a difficulty in practical construction of template banks without any dimensional reduction irrespective of the strategy .",
    "the gravitational - wave pulse from an eccentric binary more resembles a detector glitch than the chirp signal from circular binaries does .",
    "sequences of pulses may be naturally distinguished from noises by multidetector coincidences with information of timing consistency , and it might require human validation processes at least in the early epoch of second - generation gravitational - wave detectors . if high false alarm rates are allowed for the purpose of merger alerts to electromagnetic follow - up observations , omitting time consuming validation processes might be an option .",
    "another , possibly ambitious , way to reduce effective latency might be to first carefully analyse gravitational - wave signals sufficiently before the merger aiming at rejecting false alarms , and next analyse signals as close to the merger as possible assuming that the signal is physical with available information from the first stage of analysis .",
