    "have you ever been confused and tired using city public transport ? have you studied city maps during your holiday s excursions looking for the best connection from a railway station to your hotel ?",
    "do you think there is any regularity in complex objects called _ public transport systems _ ? during the last few years several transport networks",
    "have already been investigated using various concepts of statistical physics of complex networks .",
    "a study of boston underground transportation system ( mbta ) @xcite has taken into account physical distances and has been focused on problems of links efficiency and costs . in @xcite a part of the indian railway network ( irn ) has been considered and a new topology describing the system as a set of train lines , not stops has been introduced . in @xcite data from mbta and u - bahn network of vienna have been compared to predictions of random bipartite graphs .",
    "another class of transport systems form airport and airlines networks : world - wide @xcite , chinese @xcite or indian @xcite airline networks - here such properties as links weights , correlations among different airports and their centrality have been investigated .    in the present paper",
    "we have studied a part of data for public transport networks in @xmath2 polish cities and we find that among apparent differences there are also universal features of these systems . as far as we know ,",
    "our results are the first comparative survey of several individual transport systems in the same country .",
    "it is clear that distances for city travelers are not the same as physical distances if he / she needs to come from a city point @xmath3 to a city point @xmath4 using existing public transport media .",
    "sometimes it occurs that a physical distance between points @xmath3 and @xmath4 is not very large but the travel between these points in the city is unfortunately time consuming since either a direct bus makes a lot of loops on its way or we need to change buses or tramways several times .",
    "it follows that one can introduce at least two different representations of city transport networks where a network is a set of nodes ( vertices ) and links ( edges ) between them .",
    "the first representation is the space l which consists of nodes being bus or tramway stops while a link between two nodes exists provided they are consecutive stops on a bus or a tramway line .",
    "the distance in such a space is measured by the total number of stops passed on the shortest path between two nodes .",
    "however the distance measured in such a way does not reflect the necessity of transfer during the trip .",
    "this factor is taken into account in the second space p @xcite .",
    "nodes in such a space are the same as in the previous one but now an edge connecting two nodes means that there is a link by a _",
    "single _ bus or tramway between them .",
    "it follows that in the space p the distances are numbers of _ transfers _ ( plus one ) needed during the trip .",
    "it is obvious that distances defined in the space p are much shorter than in the space l and there is no universal relation between them .",
    "both spaces are presented at fig .",
    "[ fig : przestrzenie ] .",
    "we have studied data collected from 21 public transport networks in polish cities that are depicted at fig . [",
    "fig : mapa ] and listed in the table [ tabela ] .",
    "the first analyzed features are degree distributions for networks represented in both spaces .",
    "a degree of node @xmath5 is the number @xmath6 of its nearest neighbors . in regular networks ( e.g. crystals ) all nodes ( e.g. atoms )",
    "can have the same degree .",
    "in complex networks @xcite there is a wide spectrum of degrees and a large interest on such systems started from a discovery of scale - free distributions in several real networks @xcite .    the fig .",
    "[ fig : pl ] shows typical plots for degree distribution in the space l. in all studied plots we neglected the point @xmath7 that corresponds to line ends .",
    "remaining parts of degree distributions can be approximately described by a power law    @xmath8    with a characteristic exponent @xmath9 between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "values of exponents @xmath9 are different from the value @xmath12 which is characteristic for barabsi - albert model of evolving networks with preferential attachment and one can suppose that a corresponding model for transport network evolution should include several other effects .",
    "one can see also that larger exponents @xmath9 correspond usually to larger numbers @xmath13 of nodes in the network ( table [ tabela ] ) .",
    "a quite other situation is in the space p. corresponding cumulative degree distributions for selected cities @xmath14 are presented at fig .",
    "[ fig : pk ] .",
    "the distributions @xmath15 and @xmath16 are well fitted by exponential representation    @xmath17    as it is well known @xcite the exponential distribution ( [ alpha ] ) can occur when a network evolves but nodes are attached completely _",
    "randomly_. we are surprised that such a random evolution could well correspond to the topology of urban transport networks .",
    "table [ tabela ] presents exponents @xmath9 and @xmath18 for investigated cities .",
    "the values have been received from the standard linear regression method .",
    ".number of nodes @xmath13 , coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath18 with their standard errors @xmath19 , @xmath20 and pearson s coefficients @xmath21 , @xmath22 , for considered cities .",
    "the last column @xmath23 represents pearson s coefficient for the scaling ( [ ab ] ) . fitting to the scaling relations ( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ ab ] )",
    "has been performed at whole ranges of degrees @xmath24 .",
    "fitting to ( [ alpha ] ) has been performed at approximately half of available ranges to exclude large fluctuations occurring for higher degrees ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pk ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in @xcite an analytical model of average path length was considered and it was shown that the shortest path length between nodes @xmath5 and @xmath26 possessing degrees @xmath6 and @xmath27 in a random graph characterized by its degree distribution @xmath16 can be described as :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is euler constant while @xmath30 and @xmath31 are corresponding first and second moments of @xmath16 distributions . in @xcite a random tree ( a random graph with no loops ) was studied and it was shown that    @xmath32    where coefficients @xmath3 an @xmath4 depend on an average branching factor @xmath33 of the considered tree and on a total number of its edges @xmath34",
    "@xmath35    @xmath36    we have found that if distances are measured in the space l then the scaling ( [ ab ] ) is well fulfilled for considered public transport networks ( fig . [ fig : lij ] ) .",
    "table [ tabela ] presents corresponding pearson s coefficients .",
    "one can see that except the cases of biaystok and gop all other @xmath37 coefficients are above @xmath38 and the best fit to the scaling relation ( [ ab ] ) has been found for zielona gra , where @xmath39",
    ". observed values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 coefficients differ as much as 20 percent ( in average ) from theoretical values received for random graphs where contribution from clustering and node degree correlations are taken into account ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is useless to examine the relation ( [ ab ] ) in the space p because of the structure of this space .",
    "in fact the set @xmath40 contains usually only 3 points what means that one needs just two changes of a bus or a tram to come from one city point to another @xcite .",
    "in conclusion we have observed that public transport networks in many polish cities follow universal scalings .",
    "the degree distribution @xmath16 fits to a power law in the space l where a distance is measured in numbers of bus or tram stops .",
    "a corresponding distribution in the space p where a distance is measured in a number of transfers between different vehicles follows an exponential distribution .",
    "distances in the space l are a linear function of logarithms of corresponding nodes degrees .",
