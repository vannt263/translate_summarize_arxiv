    "almost all the hadrons are described by assuming that they are composed of minimal numbers of quarks to construct color singlet states , i.e. , three quarks ( @xmath13 ) for baryons and a quark ",

    "however , the fundamental theory of strong interaction , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , allows us to consider hadrons whose structure can not be classified into @xmath13 nor @xmath14 , such as pentaquark systems ( @xmath15 ) , as long as they are color singlet states .",
    "they are called `` exotic '' hadrons .",
    "one of the exotic hadron candidates is the lowest hyperon resonance , @xmath8 , which has been expected to be a @xmath16 bound state rather than a @xmath17 state for a long time  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is very encouraging that recent experimental analyses in heavy - quark sector discovered charged quarkonium - like states  @xcite and charmonium  pentaquark states  @xcite as candidates of the exotic hadrons .    in order to conclude the structure of an exotic hadron candidate ,",
    "it is essential to clarify quark  gluon composition of the hadron .",
    "for example , the total number of constituent quarks and antiquarks is @xmath18 for a usual @xmath13 baryon , but it becomes @xmath19 for a pentaquark @xmath15 state . although one can not , in general , count the total number of quarks and antiquarks inside a hadron due to the annihilation and creation of a quark ",
    "antiquark pair , there is an exception in hard exclusive reactions with large scattering angles .",
    "there , the so - called constituent - counting rule emerges as a scaling behavior of the cross sections according to perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "actually , in the constituent - counting rule , the scaling factor for the cross section corresponds to the total number of elementary constituents involved in the hard - exclusive reaction .",
    "this enables us to determine the number of elementary constituents inside hadrons .    in the experimental side ,",
    "the constituent - counting rule was first applied in ref .",

    "the @xmath28 reaction was analyzed recently by the jlab ( thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ) hall - a and e94 - 104 collaborations @xcite , and they found that the experimental data are consistent with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",

    "various meson photoproductions from clas were investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the author could not conclude the scaling for the vector mesons as suggested in conventional quark models due to additional gluon exchanges from higher fock states for hadrons .",
    "the constituent - counting rule was also confirmed by two - body hadronic exclusive reactions at bnl ( brookhaven national laboratory)-ags ( alternating gradient synchrotron )  @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the constituent - counting rule was experimentally shown to be valid even for nuclei  @xcite ; the numbers of elementary constituents inside the deuteron , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are counted as @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "on the other hand , there are theoretical proposals recently to use the constituent - counting rule for clarifying the internal structure of hadrons , especially exotic - hadron candidates  @xcite .",
    "actually , if a baryon ( meson ) contains more than three ( two ) constituents as an exotic hadron , it should explicitly affect the scaling behavior of its production cross section at high energies .",
    "moreover , since the number of elementary constituents inside nuclei is counted as @xmath36 and @xmath37  @xcite , we can apply the constituent - counting rule not only to compact exotic hadrons but also to hadronic molecules composed of two ( or more ) color singlet states , although we can not distinguish whether the hadron is a compact multiquark system or a hadronic molecule solely by the constituent - counting rule .",
    "for instance , the number of constituents inside @xmath8 is considered to be five if it is a @xmath38 bound state , which can not be distinguished from a compact pentaquark state only by the scaling behavior .",
    "nevertheless , there are possibilities that compact multiquark and diffuse hadron - molecule states could be further distinguished by the so - called compositeness  @xcite and hadron tomography in terms of three - dimensional structure functions , generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , transverse - momentum - dependent parton distributions ( tmds ) , and generalized distribution amplitudes ( gdas ) @xcite .",
    "however , much efforts should be made for such tomography studies because there is no experimental information on these observables for exotic hadron candidates at this stage .    in this article",
    ", we use the constituent - counting rule as a guiding principle in analyzing available experimental data on hard exclusive cross sections at high energies .",

    "we analyzed the exclusive photoproduction data of hyperons , @xmath265 [ @xmath266 , @xmath41 , @xmath8 , @xmath267 , or @xmath10 ] by using the constituent - counting rule at high energies for determining the number of constituents involved in the exclusive reactions .",
    "our studies intend to clarify the internal constituents of an exotic hadron candidate @xmath251 , because the counting rule is considered to be valid for hadrons and nuclei , such as the proton , the pion , and deuteron .",
    "therefore , our work can shed light on a new method of exotic - hadron studies for clarifying their internal structure by high - energy reactions where quark and gluon degrees of freedom are valid .",
    "our analysis results indicate that the data for the reactions @xmath269 and @xmath270 are consistent with the factor @xmath134 .",
    "it suggests that @xmath0 and @xmath41 have three quark constituents in them , which is consistent with conventional quark models . on the other hand , at this moment it is difficult to pin down the factor @xmath45 for the photoproductions of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 due to lack of data .",
    "nevertheless , the observed scaling behavior of hyperon @xmath8 seems to suggest that it is not purely three - quark or five - quark system .",
    "the number of constituent quarks for the excited hyperons could be determined by their photoproduction processes in principle if enough data are taken in a wide energy region .",
    "if an excited hyperon is a mixture of three - quark and five - quark states , energy dependence of the scaling behavior could provide valuable information for its composition and mixture .",
    "the current method was not applied to exotic hadrons until recently , and it should be a new approach for identifying exotic hadrons and for clarifying their internal structure . the scaling for exotic hadron candidates",
    "should be clarified by precise cross - section measurements in future for the photoproductions in the high - energy region ( @xmath12 gev ) and also hadronic exclusive reactions , for example , at j - parc ( japan proton accelerator research complex ) @xcite .",

    "<S> we analyze the clas data on the photoproduction of hyperon resonances , as well as the available data for the ground state @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the clas and slac - e84 collaborations , by considering constituent - counting rule suggested by perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the counting rule emerges as a scaling behavior of cross sections in hard exclusive reactions with large scattering angles , and it enables us to determine the number of elementary constituents inside hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it could be used as a new method for identifying internal constituents of exotic - hadron candidates . from the analyses of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 reactions , we find that the number of the elementary constituents is consistent with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the analysis is made for the photoproductions of the hyperon resonances @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , where @xmath8 is considered to be a @xmath11 molecule and hence its constituent number could be five . however , we find that the current data are not enough to conclude the numbers of their constituent . </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to investigate the higher - energy region at @xmath12 gev experimentally beyond the energy of the available clas data for counting the number of constituents clearly . </S>",
    "<S> we also mention that our results indicate energy dependence in the constituent number , especially for @xmath8 . if an excited hyperon is a mixture of three - quark and five - quark states , the energy dependence of the scaling behavior could be valuable for finding its composition and mixture . </S>"
