    "the radiative pion decay @xmath0 is a very interesting process from different points of view . according to the standard description , the corresponding decay amplitude consists of the inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) and structure - dependent ( sd ) terms .",
    "the former can be associated with the diagrams in which the photon is radiated by the electrically charged external legs ( either pion or lepton ) , while the sd terms correspond to the photon emission from intermediate states generated by strong interactions .",
    "since the ib contribution turns out to be helicity suppressed , this process is an adequate channel to study the sd amplitude , which provides information about strong interactions in the nonperturbative regime .",
    "the sd contribution can be parameterized through the introduction of vector and axial - vector form factors , @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , where @xmath5 is the squared invariant mass of the @xmath6 pair  @xcite . from the experimental point of view",
    ", recent analyses  @xcite of @xmath7 decays have allowed the measurement of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and the slope of the form factor @xmath10 at @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , ongoing experiments are expected to reach enough statistics to determine the slope of @xmath12 at @xmath11 in the near future . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the analysis of the form factors has been carried out in the framework of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath13pt )  @xcite and effective meson lagrangian methods  @xcite , which provide a good description of low - energy meson phenomenology .",
    "however , one can also address the question of how the form factors are connected to the underlying quark structure .",
    "due to the nonperturbative nature of the quark - gluon interactions in the low - energy domain , to address this issue one is forced to deal with models that treat quark interactions in some effective way . in this sense ,",
    "the widely studied nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio ( njl ) model is the most popular schematic quark effective theory for qcd  @xcite . in this model",
    "quarks interact through a local , chiral invariant four - fermion coupling .",
    "now , as a step towards a more adequate description of qcd , some extensions of the njl that include nonlocal interactions have been proposed in the literature ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , nonlocality arises as a natural feature of several well established approaches to low energy quark dynamics , such as the instanton liquid model  @xcite , the schwinger - dyson resummation techniques  @xcite , and also lattice qcd calculations  @xcite . in the last years",
    "nonlocal chiral quark models have been applied to study different hadron observables with significant success  @xcite .    in a previous work",
    "@xcite we have addressed the analysis of the vector and axial - vector form factors in @xmath14 in the framework of nonlocal chiral quark models .",
    "we have determined the values of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the slope of @xmath10 at @xmath11 for different parameterization sets , comparing the results with the experimental measurements and the corresponding values obtained in the njl model . in this paper",
    "we extend these previous results , analyzing the vector form factor for values of @xmath17 up to 1 gev@xmath18 , and studying the slope of @xmath12 at threshold .",
    "while the latter is interesting in view of the comparison with future experimental results , the study of the behavior of @xmath10 presents relevant theoretical motivations .",
    "in fact , in the isospin limit , and assuming the conserved - vector - current ( cvc ) hypothesis , the vector form factor can be directly related to the form factor @xmath19 associated with the vertex @xmath20 , where @xmath17 is the photon virtuality in euclidean space . thus our results can be compared with the experimental information on @xmath19 , taken e.g.  from processes as @xmath21 or @xmath22 , and the compatibility with the usually assumed single - pole behavior can be analyzed .",
    "the cvc hypothesis is supported by the measured value of @xmath8 , which turns out to be fully consistent with the corresponding value taken from @xmath19 at @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "we notice that the calculation of @xmath10 in the framework of nonlocal models turns out to be technically involved , due to the presence of poles and cuts arising from the dressed quark propagators . finally , to complete our analysis",
    "we also study the compatibility of our nonlocal models with effective meson theories such as @xmath13pt .",
    "in fact , it is seen that @xmath16 and the pion charge radius @xmath24 are related to the so - called @xmath13pt low energy constants ( lecs ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which encode the information of quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "in @xmath13pt these lecs are input parameters taken from phenomenology , thus the compatibility with the predictions arising from effective quark models is a measure of the ability of these models to account for the underlying strong interaction physics .    the article is organized as follows : in sect .  ii we describe the models and quote the analytical results for the vector form factor @xmath10 .",

    "non - local interactions the quark propagators might have several different poles , this procedure has to be repeated each time a new pole threshold is overpassed . in the case of set c",
    "the situation is even more complicated due to the existence of a cut arising from the particular @xmath5 dependence of the interaction form factors , eqs .",

    "( [ mono ] ) , the discrepancies between the model predictions and the empirical fit observed in fig .",
    "2 can be traced back to the values of @xmath147 ( or @xmath146 ) , i.e.  the slopes of the curves at @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , these discrepancies are not unexpected , since our model does not include vector - vector interactions .",
    "the magnitude of the corresponding corrections can be estimated by considering e.g.  the extended njl model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite : indeed , it is seen that the vector contribution to @xmath148 has the right order of magnitude and sign in order to account for the discrepancies .",

    "@xcite , for @xmath9 the triangle diagram in fig .",
    "1a turns out to be the dominant one , giving at least 98% of the total value for all three parameter sets considered here . in the case of the slope",
    "the triangle diagram is still the dominant one , but the contributions from diagrams in figs .",
    "1b and 1e are also significant .",
    "one should note that nonlocal models of the type considered here lead to values of @xmath9 which are significantly different from those of @xmath8 .",
    "this is remarkable , since other approaches like the njl model  @xcite or the spectral quark model  @xcite tend to give @xmath151 .",
    "given the triangle diagram dominance mentioned above , the origin of this difference can be traced back to the different dressing of the @xmath152 and @xmath153 terms in the coupling of the @xmath154 to the quarks  @xcite . from table",
    "ii it is seen that the predictions for @xmath16 in nonlocal models are significantly closer than the experimental value than the result obtained in the standard njl model .",
    "regarding the slope parameter @xmath155 , we find that our predictions are quite similar for the three parameter sets considered , and turn out to be about 3/5 smaller than the value obtained in a resonance effective model  @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we have focused our attention on the ability of our quark models to reproduce the main features of the vector and axial - vector form factors .",
    "an alternative point of view ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) is to consider quark models as the generators of the pion @xmath13pt lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "@xmath13pt describes the low energy physics of pions in a universal way , once the order in the momentum and chiral breaking expansion ( i.e.  the order in the chiral expansion ) is specified .",

    "@xcite . on general grounds",

    "the constant @xmath161 is related to the vacuum expectation value of quarks in the chiral limit and it can be expressed as @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the pion mass at leading order in the chiral expansion .",
    "this notation follows that of ref .",
    "@xcite where the definition of the covariant derivative @xmath164 and the field strength tensor @xmath165 can be also found .",
    "note that among all possible terms in @xmath166 only those relevant for our calculation have been explicitly given .    as a result of the procedure that leads to eq .",
    "( [ chiralexpansion ] ) the explicit expressions for the lecs in terms of model parameters and form factors @xmath167 and @xmath168 can be obtained and eventually numerically calculated . however , a simpler and more direct way to obtain their numerical values is to extract them from the model predictions for the physical quantities they are related to .",
    "of course , when proceeding in this way some care must be taken .",
    "in fact , since the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ chiralexpansion ] ) is valid up to fourth order in the chiral expansion , to extract the corresponding lecs from the physical quantities obtained in our quark scenarios we should treat them to the same order of approximation . namely , we should calculate the relevant quantities in the chiral limit and its vicinity . as described in detailed in ref .",

    "therefore , even if the quark couplings lead to some interaction in these channels , the models do not account for the effect of vector and axial - vector meson resonances .",

    "this is indicated by the fact that there is a slight difference between the values of the parameters @xmath147 and @xmath146 for our three model parametrizations [ the parameters @xmath147 and @xmath146 are defined by eqs .",
    "( [ mono ] ) and ( [ slope ] ) ] . on the other hand",
    ", it is found that for all three parametrizations our results for @xmath147 and @xmath146 are below experimental estimates .",
    "these discrepancies are not unexpected , since our model does not include vector - vector interactions . in fact",
    ", a simple estimate based on an extended njl model  @xcite indicates that the vector contribution to @xmath148 has the right order of magnitude and sign in order to account for the differences .",
    "this could be tested for the present nonlocal models that include wave function renormalization through the explicit inclusion of vector - vector interactions . regarding the slope parameter @xmath155",
    ", we find that our predictions are quite similar for the three parameter sets considered , and turn out to be about 3/5 smaller than the value obtained in a resonance effective model  @xcite .",
    "finally , we also have extended the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the compatibility of our nonlocal models with effective meson theories such as @xmath13pt is studied .",
    "indeed , we have been able to extract the model predictions for the @xmath13pt low energy constants ( lecs ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 , taking into account the relation between these lecs and the values of @xmath16 and the pion charge radius @xmath24 .",
    "considering the results for @xmath3 and @xmath4 together with the values of @xmath188 previously obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , we observe that the predictions for both the sign and the order of magnitude of the lecs within the present non - local models are in overall reasonably good agreement with the results from @xmath13pt .",
    "for the particular case of @xmath171 and @xmath172 , we find that the ( absolute ) values obtained are somewhat small , a fact that as in the case of @xmath147 and @xmath146 might be attributed to the lack of explicit vector and axial - vector interactions in our models . in any case",
    ", it is seen that nonlocal model predictions for @xmath3 are closer to the result of @xmath13pt than the value obtained in the framework of the local njl model .",
