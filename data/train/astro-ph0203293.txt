    "is the purpose of the present paper .    in the past various velocity distributions have been considered .",
    "the most popular one is the isothermal maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution with @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the velocity of the sun around the galaxy , i.e. @xmath14 . extensions of this m - b distribution were also considered , in particular those that were axially symmetric with enhanced dispersion in the galactocentric direction @xcite . in such distributions",
    "an upper cutoff @xmath15 was introduced by hand .",
    "non isothermal models have also been considered . among those one",
    "should mention the late infall of dark matter into the galaxy , i.e caustic rings @xcite , and dark matter orbiting the sun @xcite .",
    "the correct approach in our view is to consider the eddington approach @xcite , i.e. to obtain both the density and the velocity distribution from a mass distribution , which depends both on the velocity and the gravitational potential .",
    "this approach has been extensively studied by merritt @xcite and recently applied to dark matter by ullio and kamionkowski@xcite",

    "( -2e)^ [ distr.5 ] ( @xmath21 is negative for a bound system ) , where @xmath26 is a parameter , which will depend on the type of matter , and @xmath27 is a normalization constant , which will be related to the density at some point . with this choice of the distribution function",
    "it is quite straightforward to find the relationship between the density @xmath20 and the potential .",
    "the result is = k _ 2^+3/2 |(r)|^+3/2  ( + 1,3/2 ) [ distr.6 ] with ( a , b)= [ distr.7 ] eq .",

    "the constant @xmath30 is related to the density at the origin via the relation : k_= [ distrb.6d ] the above distribution function is isotropic . following merritt @xcite we can introduce an anisotropy by modifying the distribution function as follows : f(e , j)=k _ ( -2e)^(1 ) [ distr.8 ] instead of the parameter @xmath31 we find it convenient for our applications later on ( see below ) to adopt the more recent conventions and write the above equation as follows : f(e , j)=k _ ( -2e)^[1+_s ] [ distr.9 ] where @xmath32 is the maximum velocity allowed by the potential , to be specified below , and @xmath33 the asymmetry parameter .",

    "this approach can easily deal with asymmetric density distributions .",
    "the simplicity of the relation between the density and the potential thus yields the bonus that the obtained velocity distribution is analytic and can easily implemented in obtaining the event rates for direct dark matter detections.it can also be extended to include more than one power in @xmath26 . in this paper",

    "our results in the eddington theory are substantially larger .",
    "this is due to the larger peak value attained as well as the larger allowed range of x. on the other hand we know that in the gaussian model the total rate is not significantly affected by the asymmetry @xcite .",

    "note the presence of the factor of @xmath154 , since the azimuthal integration of the recoiling nucleus is not present and we intend to use the same nucleon cross - section both in the directional and the non directional case .",
    "the total rate is proportional to : r_dir=  _ u_min^u_max()_dirdu [ dir.1 ] taking again the lowest fourier components of the obtained rate as a function of the phase of the earth we get an expression similar to eq .",

    "similarly if one observes in a plane perpendicular to the sun s velocity @xmath159 . instead of @xmath155 it is best to use the ratio : = 2  = [ dir.3 ] the parameter @xmath160 is essentially independent of the lsp mass , the nuclear parameters and the asymmetry parameter @xmath33 .",

    "in the present paper we studied the density and velocity distributions of cold dark matter in the context of the eddington theory , considering not only symmetric but axially symmetric distributions as well . in our approach",

    "we should mention that this distribution is not maxwellian and has an upper velocity cutoff built into into it and not put in by hand as in the traditional treatment with gaussian distribution .",
    "our results depend on a minimum set of parameters , which were treated as free ( see table [ tab.1 ] ) .",
    "we saw that in the context of this theory the predicted rotational velocities , see figs [ f.vd1 ] - [ f.vs2 ] , depending on the input parameters , can vary significantly in the presence of the asymmetry .",
    "this comes mainly from the factor @xmath162 in the second term of eq .",
    "[ dens.1b ] , when the parameter @xmath35 is reasonably large . by comparing our results to the observed rotational curves",
    "@xcite , one may constrain the parameters of the model .",
    "the best choice seems to be the case with a small asymmetry parameter @xmath33 .",
    "we have also made a preliminary study of the effect of the new velocity distribution on the direct detection rates for cold dark matter .",
    "for illustration purposes we have selected the case @xmath58 .",
    "we have seen that , in the context of the eddington approach , the total rates , unlike the case of the gaussian distribution @xcite , sensitively depend on the asymmetry parameter @xmath33 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , when the asymmetry changes , the upper value of the velocity distribution also changes .",
    "it is thus not surprising that , in the eddington theory , the total ( non directional and non modulated ) event rates for direct lsp detection maybe substantially different from those of the phenomenological gaussian distributions ( compare figs [ psi1 ] and [ psi2 ] ) .",
    "the strong dependence of the rate on the asymmetry parameter remains even after the nuclear form factor has been incorporated ( see fig .",
    "[ t.u ] ) .",
    "results of more detailed calculations of the event rates will appear elsewhere .",
    "the dependence of the directional and/or modulated rates on the velocity distribution is currently under study .",
