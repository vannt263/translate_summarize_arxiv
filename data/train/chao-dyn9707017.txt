    "hence this magnetic system can be taken as a model of the parametrically forced pendulum equation .",
    "hereafter we will call this magnetic oscillator a parametrically forced magnetic pendulum ( mp ) .",
    "the parametrically forced pendulum , albeit simple looking , shows a richness in its dynamical behaviors . as the normalized driving amplitude @xmath1 is increased , transitions from periodic attractors to chaotic attracors and _ vice _ _ versa _ , coexistence of different attractors , transient chaos , multiple period - doubling transitions to chaos , and so on have been numerically found @xcite .",
    "some of them have also been observed in real experiments on the parametrically forced mp @xcite and gp @xcite .",
    "however , so far only the case of @xmath20 ( i.e. , the case @xmath21 ) has been studied in the experiments on the mp .    in this paper",
    ", we study experimentally the bifurcations associated with stability of the sp s in the parametrically forced mp by varying the normalized natural frequency @xmath0 and the normalized driving amplitude @xmath1 , and then compare the experimental results with the numerical results obtained using the floquet theory @xcite .",
    "we first note that the mp has two sp s .",
    "one is the `` normal '' sp with @xmath22 , and the other one is the `` inverted '' sp with @xmath23 . for the case of the `` unforced '' simple mp ( with @xmath24 ) , the normal sp is stable , while the inverted sp is unstable .",
    "however , as @xmath1 is increased above a critical value , the normal sp loses its stability . using the floquet theory , bifurcations occurring at such critical values",
    "have been numerically studied by one of us ( kim ) and lee @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the normal sp , the inverted sp gains its stability when @xmath1 exceeds a critical value @xcite .",
    "we also study numerically bifurcations associated with stability of the inverted sp using the floquet theory for a comparison with the experimental results .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first explain the experimental setup for the parametrically forced mp in sec .",
    "[ sec : es ] .",
    "bifurcations of the two sp s are then experimentally investigated in sec .",
    "[ sec : bif ] .",
    "it is observed that as @xmath1 is increased beyond a critical value , the normal sp loses its stability either by a period - doubling bifurcation or by a symmetry - breaking pitchfork bifurcation , depending on the values of @xmath0 .",
    "for the case of the period - doubling bifurcation , a new stable symmetric orbit with period @xmath25 is born , while for the case of the symmetry - breaking pitchfork bifurcation a conjugate pair of new stable asymmetric orbits with period @xmath26 appears .",
    "in contrast with the normal sp , the inverted sp is observed to gain its stability when @xmath1 exceeds a 1st critical value @xmath27 by a pitchfork bifurcation , but it also destabilizes for a higher 2nd critical value @xmath28 of @xmath1 by a period - doubling bifurcation .",
    "thus the inverted sp becomes stable in the interval between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "[ sec : sum ] gives a summary .",
    "an exploded view of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ev ] .",
    "the physical mp consists of a permanent bar magnet , an aluminum damping plate , and a code wheel , which are coaxially attached to a rotation axis .",
    "this mp shows rich dynamical behaviors in a spatially uniform magnetic field @xmath6 , generated by helmholtz coils .",
    "each component of the apparatus is explained in some details below .",
    "a permanent bar magnet , glued to a rotation axis guided by a small ball in the lowest part and by a tiny pin in the highest part , is placed in the center of two sets of helmholtz coils , producing the magnetic field @xmath6 perpendicular to the rotation axis .",
    "the number of turns @xmath29 and the radius @xmath30 for a large set of helmholtz coils are @xmath31 and @xmath32 cm , while they are @xmath33 and @xmath34 cm for a smaller set of helmholtz coils .",
    "the large set of helmholtz coils is given a direct current @xmath35 to supply a steady dc component @xmath10 of @xmath6 .",
    "on the other hand , the smaller set of helmholtz coils , which is nested inside the large set and driven by a pasco model ci-6552a ac power amplifier , provides a sinusoidally time - varying ac component of @xmath6 with amplitude @xmath11 and frequecny @xmath12 .",
    "this amplifier can handle currents up to @xmath26 a. since higher currents are necessary in some range of @xmath0 , we also use a current booster to increase the current up to @xmath25 a.    we take into account the effect of the normal component @xmath36 of the earth s magnetic field @xmath37 perpendicular to the rotation axis , and align both the dc and ac components of the applied magnetic field @xmath6 parallel to @xmath36 . the angle of the permanent bar magnet is experimentally measured from this aligned direction ( i.e. , the direction of @xmath36 ) . since the effective dc component @xmath38 of the total magnetic field is given by @xmath39 , the natural frequency @xmath40 in eq .",

    "a damping force proportional to the angular velocity can be supplied by an eddy current brake .",
    "such eddy - current damping is adjusted by controlling the separation between the aluminum damping plate and the horseshoe magnet with a micrometer screw .",
    "it is also possible to determine a damping parameter @xmath46 @xmath47 and the natural frequency @xmath40 by fitting a sampled time - series @xmath48 for the unforced case of @xmath49 to an equation , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 are some constants ) , which is just the angle in the case of the underdamped motion of the unforced mp for small angular displacements .",
    "for data acquisition and experimental control , we use commercial products , `` rotary motion sensor '' and `` signal interface , '' manufactured by the pasco scientific . a pasco model ci-6538 rotary motion sensor set consists of a code wheel with @xmath53 slots ( i.e. , a disk with angular code in the form of sectors which are pervious or impervious to light ) and an encoder module containing a light - emitting diode ( led ) and two photodiodes with signal - processing circuitry . as the code wheel moves , the light signal emitted from the led",
    "is interrupted by the slots and electrically encoded .",
    "thus a code wheel with @xmath53 slots can generate raw data with a resolution of @xmath54 rad . a personal computer equipped with a pasco model",
    "ci-6560 signal interface unit analyses the signals from the rotary motion sensor and provides an easy - to - use data set of @xmath55 at a chosen sampling rate .",
    "it also performs a convenient experimental control .",
    "in this section we first analyse the bifurcations associated with stability of the sp s in the parametrically forced mp , using the floquet theory .",
    "the experimental results for the cases of the normal and inverted sp s are then presented and compared with the numerical results .",
    "the normalized second - order ordinary differential equation ( [ eq : mp2 ] ) is reduced to two first - order ordinary differential equations :    @xmath56    [ eq : mp3 ]    these equations have an inversion symmetry @xmath57 , since the transformation @xmath58 leaves eq .",

    "the poincar maps of an initial point @xmath63 $ ] can be computed by sampling the orbit points @xmath64 at the discrete time @xmath65 , where @xmath66  .",
    "we call the transformation @xmath67 the poincar ( time-1 ) map , and write @xmath68 .",

    "here we investigate bifurcations associated with stability of the two normal and inverted fp s of @xmath73 .",
    "the linear stability of an fp is determined from the linearized - map matrix @xmath76 of @xmath73 at @xmath77 .",

    "the eigenvalues , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , of @xmath98 are called the floquet ( stability ) multipliers of the fp .",

    "hence the pair of floquet multipliers of an fp lies either on the circle of radius @xmath106 or on the real axis in the complex plane .",
    "the fp is stable only when both floquet multipliers lie inside the unit circle .",
    "we first note that they never cross the unit circle except at the real axis ( i.e. , they never have complex values with moduli larger than unity ) , and hence hopf bifurcations do not occur .",
    "consequently , the fp can lose its stability only when a floquet multiplier @xmath107 decreases ( increases ) through @xmath108 @xmath109 on the real axis .",

    "when a floquet multiplier @xmath107 increases through @xmath26 , it becomes unstable via pitchfork bifurcation , which results in the birth of a conjugate pair of new stable asymmetric orbits with period @xmath26 .",

    "<S> an experimental study of bifurcations associated with stability of stationary points ( sp s ) in a parametrically forced magnetic pendulum and a comparison of its results with numerical results are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the critical values for which the sp s lose or gain their stability are experimentally measured by varying the two parameters @xmath0 ( the normalized natural frequency ) and @xmath1 ( the normalized driving amplitude ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that , when the amplitude @xmath1 exceeds a critical value , the normal sp with @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the angle between the permanent magnet and the magnetic field ) becomes unstable either by a period - doubling bifurcation or by a symmetry - breaking pitchfork bifurcation , depending on the values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in contrast with the normal sp the inverted sp with @xmath4 is observed to become stable as @xmath1 is increased above a critical value by a pitchfork bifurcation , but it also destabilizes for a higher critical value of @xmath1 by a period - doubling bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> all of these experimental results agree well with numerical results obtained using the floquet theory . </S>"
