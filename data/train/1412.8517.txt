    "such regimes must inherently constitute a nonlocal fgr @xcite , meaning that the flux at a given place and time is codependent on the density gradient at other locations and/or earlier times .",
    "one can equivalently say that the fgr develops spatial and/or temporal memory .",
    "earlier literature on nondiffusive transport acknowledges @xcite or explicitly addresses @xcite fgr delocalisation but did not pursue characterisation of the associated memory aspects themselves .",
