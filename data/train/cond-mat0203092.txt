    "there has been considerable recent activity @xcite analyzing @xmath1 , the probability distribution for the length of shortest path , @xmath0 , between two points separated by euclidean distance @xmath2 in a percolation system @xcite .",
    "this paper extends that work by determining the scaling form of the distribution of shortest paths between two lines of arbitrary position , relative orientation and lengths in 3-dimensional systems .",
    "these configurations are important because they much more accurately model the configurations used in oil recovery in which fluid is injected in one well ( one of the lines in our configuration ) and oil is recovered at a second well ( the second line in our configuration ) ; the wells may , in reality , be at arbitrary orientation and of different lengths .",
    "the scaling form for the 2-points configuration in which the 2 points are located at @xmath3 in a system of side @xmath4 has been found to be @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 the exponents @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are universal and the constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 depend on lattice type . in 3d , the values of these exponents have previously been found to be @xcite @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the first stretched exponential function , @xmath18 , reflects the fact that the shortest path must always be at least equal to the distance @xmath2 between the two points ; the second stretched exponential function , @xmath19 , reflects the fact that the lengths of the shortest paths are bounded because of the finite size , @xmath4 , of the system .",
    "we find that the scaling form for the 2-lines configuration has the same form as that found for the shortest path distribution between two points with the exceptions that : ( i ) the power law regime of the distribution as represented by the term @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ e.1 ] ) is replaced with up to four different power law regimes ( separated by cross - over regimes ) with exponents depending on the relative orientations of the lines and ( ii ) the euclidean distance , @xmath2 , in eq .",
    "( [ e.1 ] ) between the two points is replaced by the shortest euclidean distance between the two lines .",
    "the lengths of the lines affect the sizes of the power law regimes .",
    "monte carlo simulations were performed using the leath method and growing clusters from 2 sets of seeds ",
    "one for each line .",
    "the length of the shortest path between the two lines is the sum of the chemical distances from each set of seed sites to the point where a cluster started at one set of seeds meets a cluster started from the other set of seeds @xcite .",
    "the cluster growth for a given realization is terminated when the two clusters meet . for parallel line configurations , in which the probability distributions decay rapidly",
    ", we use the method of ref.@xcite to obtain good statistics for shortest paths that have very low probabilities .",
    "we use the memory management technique described in @xcite to perform simulations in which the growing clusters never hit a boundary of the system .",
    "the clusters that are created and included in our analysis are of all sizes , not just the incipient infinite cluster .",
    "we start by considering relatively simple configurations of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ ppp1](a ) in which the lines are co - planar , of equal length and are positioned symmetrically .",
    "we will study configurations in which the lines are of unequal length [ see fig .  [ ppp1](b ) ] and/or are not positioned symmetrically [ see fig .  [",
    "ppp1](c ) ] in the following sections . in all of these configurations",
    ", @xmath2 is the shortest euclidean distance between the two lines .",
    "figure [ peq ] contains log - log plots of @xmath1 , the shortest path distribution for @xmath21 and various values of @xmath22 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath21 so that the initial cutoff is present ; for smaller values of r , lattice effects destroy this initial cutoff . since the focus of this paper is the power law regimes , not the initial or final cutoffs , in all later figures we will choose configurations with @xmath23 so that the extent of the power law regimes is as long as possible .",
    "the exception to this will be cases in which @xmath22 is very small where small @xmath2 introduces other lattice effects .",
    "we note that after the initial peak in each distribution , there is a power - law regime , the slope of which , @xmath24 , increases with increasing @xmath22 .",
    "we will call this power law regime the `` 2-lines regime . ''",
    "simple scaling arguments imply that if the lengths of the lines were infinite , these 2-lines regimes would continue indefinitely . for finite line lengths",
    ", we would expect that , for large @xmath0 , the distributions would exhibit a crossover to a power law regime with the same exponent as that for a configuration with two points  because for large @xmath0 the long paths travel far enough away from the lines that they appear to be points .",
    "in this regime , the power law exponent has the value of that of two points , 2.35 @xcite . for the plots in fig .",
    "[ peq ] , in order to see the power regimes clearly , we have chosen the lengths of the lines long enough that this crossover occurs after the maximum value of @xmath0 in the plots .    in fig .",
    "[ gl ] , we plot @xmath24 versus @xmath22 . the plot suggests that @xmath24 diverges as @xmath22 goes to zero .",
    "we attempt to fit this function with a power of @xmath25 and find the best fit with the function @xmath26 this form is not based on any fundamental theory ; it simply has the properties that @xmath27 , it diverges as @xmath22 goes to zero and it fits the intermediate points reasonably well .",
    "the crossover between the 2-line regime and the 2-point regime is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ peqcutoff ] where in each panel we plot @xmath1 for fixed @xmath22 , and various values of @xmath28 .",
    "as expected , the larger the length of the lines , the higher the value of @xmath29 , the value of @xmath0 at which the crossover occurs .",
    "quantitative analysis of the crossover behavior is given in section iii.c .",
    "we next study configurations in which one line has zero length ( i.e. , a point ) and the other is a line of finite length .",
    "this is the extreme case of the configuration in which the two lines have different length .",
    "we will study the case where both lines have finite length in the next section .",
    "we in fact study the three configurations shown in figs .",
    "[ pptlineconfig](a)(c ) .",
    "the plots of @xmath1 for these configurations are shown in fig .",
    "[ pptline1 ] .",
    "the plots have a power - law regime with exponent @xmath30 for the configurations of fig .  [ pptlineconfig](a ) and fig .  [ pptlineconfig](c ) , and exponent @xmath31 for the configuration of fig  [ pptlineconfig](b ) .",
    "we denote this regime the `` point - line regime . ''",
    "[ pptline2 ] shows the crossover from point - line behavior to 2-points behavior .",
    "we can now study configurations of the type shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) in which the lines are of different lengths , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "for such a configuration we would expect three power - law regimes : ( i ) for small @xmath0 such that the two lines appear to be infinite , a 2-line regime , with slope dependent on @xmath22 , ( ii ) a point - line regime , with slope @xmath30 , for values of @xmath0 large enough that the shorter line appears to be a point , and ( iii ) a 2-point regime , for even larger values of @xmath0 where both lines appear to be points .",
    "plots of @xmath1 for such configurations are shown in fig .",
    "[ pdiff ] and are consistent with our expectations .      the last of the co - planar configurations is of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ ppp1](c ) . in general , based on the reasoning above , for configurations of this type we would expect @xmath1 to have four power - law regimes . for the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ ppp1](c ) , in which @xmath34 , the power law regimes would be as follows : ( i ) a power law regime corresponding to the angle @xmath22 between the segments @xmath35 and @xmath33 , ( ii ) a power law regime corresponding to the angle @xmath36 between segments @xmath33 and @xmath37 , ( iii ) a point - line power law regime entered when @xmath38 , and ( iv ) the 2-points regime .",
    "figure  [ poverlap ] is a plot of @xmath1 which shows this behavior .      for non - coplanar lines , for @xmath39 ,",
    "the fact that the lines are not co - planar should be irrelevant ; what is relevant is the effective angle between the lines .",
    "this angle is obtained by sliding the lines toward each other along the line of shortest euclidean distance between the lines ( without changing their orientations ) until they touch ; the lines are then coplanar and the angle between them determines the behavior of @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ pnoncoplanar ] contains plots for two configurations which illustrate this : ( i ) two coplanar lines with @xmath23 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , and ( ii ) the same configuration with the second line translated out of the plane by distance 8 .",
    "we see that while there is some difference in the plots for small @xmath42 , the slope of the 2-lines regime is the same for the two plots .",
    "we define the value of @xmath43 at which @xmath1 crosses over from one power - law regime to another power - law regime as the value of @xmath0 where straight lines fit to the power law regimes , between which the crossover takes place , cross . in eq.([e.1 ] ) the values of @xmath0 at which the lower and upper cutoffs occur scale independently as @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . by extension , we would expect that all characteristic values of the distribution , including crossovers between different power - law regimes , would also scale as @xmath46 where x is the length in the system which controls the crossover . thus , in analogy with the scaling of the most probable value of @xmath47 , @xmath48 we would , in fact , expect that the value of @xmath0 , @xmath29 at which @xmath1 crosses over from 2-lines behavior to 2-points behavior scales as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the maximum euclidean distance between the two lines and @xmath51 is a slowly varying function of @xmath22 . in order for a 2-lines regime to exist , the 2-lines regime cutoff @xmath29 must be greater than @xmath52 , the maximum value of the distribution .",
    "that is , @xmath53^{d_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize min}}}>cr^{d_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize min}}},\\ ] ] which implies @xmath54 in figs .",
    "[ peqcutoff](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , the insets contain plots of @xmath29 vs.  @xmath55 . for @xmath56 , the scaling exponent is consistent with eq.([e.7a ] ) but for @xmath57 and 180 the scaling exponent is @xmath58 .    using the same reasoning which led to eq .",
    "( [ e.7a ] ) , we would expect the crossover from point - line to 2-points behavior to scale as    @xmath59    because @xmath28 is the length which controls this crossover ; as seen in fig .",
    "[ pptline2 ] , the larger the value of @xmath28 , the larger the value of @xmath0 at which the crossover from point - line to 2-points behavior occurs .",
    "however , as seen in the inset in fig .",
    "[ pptline2 ] , the crossover length scales with an exponent @xmath58 not @xmath9 .",
    "finally , we would expect that for different length lines , the crossover from 2-lines behavior to 2-point behavior would scale as @xmath60 because @xmath33 is the length which controls this crossover ; as seen in fig .",
    "[ pdiff ] , the larger the value of @xmath33 , the larger the value of @xmath0 at which the crossover occurs .",
    "again , the insets in fig .",
    "[ pdiff ] indicate that the crossover scales with exponent @xmath58 .",
    "we can not explain why sometimes the crossover scales with @xmath9 and sometimes it scales with an exponent about 1 .",
    "it is , of course , possible that corrections - to - scaling are strong and that we are not seeing the true asymptotic behavior of the scaling of the crossover .",
    "if this is the case , the question still remains as to why the corrections to scaling are strong in some configurations and not in others .",
    "this area is a subject for further study .",
    "as with non - parallel wells we first consider the simple configurations shown in fig .  [ ppconfig](a ) in which the parallel wells are of the same length . figure  [ ppar](a ) plots @xmath61 vs @xmath0 for @xmath23 and various @xmath28 .",
    "the initial decay of the plots increases with increasing w because the longer the wells , the lower the probability for long shortest paths",
    ". eventually , all plots cross over to a power - law regime with slope consistent with that for two points . to see if this initial decay is a lattice effect , fig .",
    "[ ppar32 ] plots of the scaled distributions @xmath62 for various @xmath2 and @xmath28 where the aspect ratio , @xmath63 is fixed at @xmath64 . changing @xmath2 and @xmath28 but keeping @xmath65 fixed results in scaling all lengths in the geometry by the same factor and the plots collapse as expected .",
    "again , we note the initial strong decay of the distribution followed by a 2-point power - law regime .",
    "the good collapse for small @xmath66 indicates that the strong initial decay is not a lattice effect .    because of the small values of @xmath0 at which the crossover to the 2-point regime occurs it is difficult to differentiate between a power - law and ( stretched ) exponential decay",
    ". we will proceed as if the decay were either a power law with slope @xmath67 or equivalently an exponential with `` effective slope '' @xmath67 .",
    "one might argue as follows that the initial decay for power parallel lines must be exponential : since the 2-lines regime of the probability distribution for a parallel well configuration must always decay faster than the 2-lines regime of a configuration with small but non - zero @xmath22 and since we believe @xmath68 goes to infinity as @xmath22 goes to zero , the decay for parallel lines must be exponential ( i.e. , faster than any power law decay ) .",
    "this , however , need not be the case . in order for a 2-lines regime to exist , eq .",
    "( [ e.16 ] ) must hold .",
    "so as we decrease @xmath22 , we must increase @xmath28 , increasing the aspect ratio @xmath65 , to maintain a 2-lines regime .",
    "but since the effective slope for parallel wells , @xmath67 increases with increasing @xmath65 , the decay can be a power law and still always have a greater slope than the configuration with small but non - zero @xmath22 .",
    "the treatment of the more complex configurations shown in figs .",
    "[ ppconfig](b ) and ( c ) follows that of non - parallel wells .",
    "@xmath69 for configurations of the type in fig .",
    "[ ppconfig](b ) would contain an initial 2-line regime with slope @xmath70 , a point - line regime , and finally a two - point regime .",
    "@xmath69 for configurations of the type in fig .",
    "[ ppconfig](c ) , with @xmath71 would contain an initial 2-line regime with slope @xmath72 , a 2-line regime with slope @xmath73 , a point - line regime , and a 2-point regime .",
    "when the length of the wells is very large and the distance between the wells is small the behavior of the most probable shortest path between the wells is the same as in a euclidean space where p=1 and all bonds are occupied .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ pmax32 ] in which we plot @xmath52 , the most probable value of the shortest path , versus @xmath2 for various lengths @xmath28 . for long enough wells , there is a regime of @xmath2 in which @xmath74 as one would expect in euclidean space in which the shortest path is a straight line path of occupied bonds . as also seen in fig  [ pmax32 ] .",
    ", for a given well length , as @xmath2 increases , there is a value of @xmath2 , @xmath75 , at which the behavior crosses over to that of 3d percolation .",
    "we can develop a simple expression for @xmath75 as follows : the probability that all bonds in a straight line path between two wells separated by distance @xmath2 are occupied is @xmath76 .",
    "the probability that one or more bonds in the straight line path is not occupied is thus @xmath77 and the probability that one or more bonds in the @xmath28 straight line paths between the wells are not occupied is @xmath78 .",
    "the probability that at least one straight line path has all bonds occupied is then @xmath79 the shortest path will exhibit euclidean behavior , i.e. , @xmath80 when @xmath81 is of the order unity . setting @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ e.50 ] ) , we find @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ pmax32 t ] we plot the observed values of @xmath75 and the values predicted by eq .",
    "( [ e.51 ] ) with a value of @xmath84 which gives the best fit to the observed values .",
    "for a given @xmath2 , we expect that a configuration with small but non - zero angle will have a power - law regime slope very close to the ( effective ) power - law regime slope of a configuration of parallel lines with the same @xmath28 .",
    "this at first leads to a seeming paradox : if we increase or decrease @xmath28 , but keep the angle of the non - parallel wells fixed , the slope of the 2-lines regime of the non - parallel well configuration does nt change as discussed in section iii.a.1 . however , if we consider this configuration as a parallel configuration , changing w changes the aspect ratio which changes the power - law regime slope as discussed in section iv.a .",
    "this seeming inconsistency is resolved as follows : on the one hand , for a 2-lines regime to exist , w must be at least as large as the value given by eq .",
    "( [ e.16 ] .",
    "if @xmath28 is too small , there will be no 2-lines regime and both the parallel and small angle configurations will look like the configuration for 2 points . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath28 is increased , keeping @xmath2 and @xmath22 fixed , the greater the deviation from parallel lines and there is no reason why the parallel and small - angle configurations should have the same slopes in their power - law regimes .",
    "thus , only for the very small range of w for which the power - law regime exists and for which the configuration with small but non - zero @xmath22 is `` close to parallel''(i.e . the difference between the values of @xmath2 and @xmath85 is small ) should the slopes of the parallel configuration and the configuration with small but non - zero @xmath22 be equal .",
    "that is , @xmath86\\approx g_{\\ell}(\\theta),\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is defined in section iv.a .",
    "motivated by the need to more realistically model the geometries found in oil recovery activities , we have determined the scaling form for the distribution of shortest paths between two lines in 3 dimensional percolation systems .",
    "using simple scaling arguments we explained the rich fractal behavior of the shortest path in these systems .",
    "a number of open questions , however , remain :    * from first principles , can one develop an expression for @xmath68 ?",
    "an exact expression for @xmath87 for two points in 2-dimensions was obtained by ziff@xcite using conformal invariance arguments .",
    "possibly this approach could be extended to find @xmath87 for point - line and 2-line configurations , at least in 2-dimensions .",
    "* how is the fact that the crossover from one power - law regime to another does not scale with the exponent @xmath88 explained ? is this simply an artifact of corrections - to - scaling which would disappear if we could simulate much larger systems or is the scaling of the crossover actually anomalous in certain configurations ?",
