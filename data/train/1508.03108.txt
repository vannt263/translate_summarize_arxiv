    "in recent years , large surveys have produced an unprecedented panchromatic view of the interstellar environment that produced cyg  ob2 .",

    "o stars in cyg  ob2 were the first known stellar sources of x - ray emission @xcite , and several of the luminous members of the association are prototypical examples for whole classes of massive star phenomena , such as the extremely luminous early - b supergiant schulte 12 ( mt91  314 in the numeration of * ? ? ? * ) , the non - thermal radio source schulte 9 ( mt91  431 ; * ? ? ?",

    "as one of the nearest regions of massive star formation , cyg  ob2 also permits detailed investigations of ob stars and their interplay with the interstellar medium , such as the stellar bowshocks associated with high - velocity members @xcite .    despite its role as a nearby laboratory of massive star astrophysics , the distance to cyg  ob2 has proven elusive . in part , this is the result of variable extinction , which complicates spectrophotometric distances .",
    "additionally , its location is at @xmath8 , where the relation between radial velocity and distance is not only double - valued but poorly - defined owing to velocity crowding along the tangent point of the local spiral arm ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",

    "spectrophotometric distance measurements span a range that includes 1.5  kpc @xcite , 2.1  kpc @xcite , 1.7  kpc @xcite , 1.7  kpc @xcite , and 1.45  kpc @xcite .",
    "additionally , studies of the eclipsing , double - lined spectroscopic binaries cyg  ob2-b17 @xcite and v382  cyg @xcite give distances of 1.5    1.8  kpc and @xmath9  kpc respectively .",
    "this range places cyg  ob2 within the local spiral arm or spur but is insufficiently precise for measuring key physical parameters such as luminosities and mass loss rates .",
    "@xcite used radio - wave very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) to measure parallaxes of five pre - main - sequence water and oh masers within cygnus  x and found that four of the five had distances between 1.3 and 1.5  kpc with typical uncertainties of 0.1  kpc .",

    "because of this , individual ob associations and star forming regions may lie anywhere within this depth .",
    "thus , independent distance measurements of individual features are needed to help refine the line of sight structure of this complex , in particular for cyg  ob2 .    in this contribution ,",

    "paper v @xcite , in particular , uses these basic data to infer the intrinsic distributions of massive binaries , concluding that : the fraction of massive stars having companions may be as high as 90% , 45% of these multiples are likely to interact at some point , there exists an excess of short - period 4  ",

    "reductions followed standard longslit techniques , including flat fielding from dome quartz lamp exposures .",
    "copper - argon arc lamp exposures were taken after each star exposure to wavelength calibrate the spectra to an rms of 0.03    ( 1.5  at 5800   ) .",
    "multiple exposures were combined yielding final signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) typically in excess of 100:1 near 5800   .",
    "final spectra were doppler corrected to the heliocentric velocity frame .",

    "this zero - point correction to each observation is needed to account for effects of image wander in the dispersion direction when the fwhm of the stellar point spread function was less than the slit width .",
    "because of these inevitable slit - placement effects on the resulting wavelength solutions , radial velocity ( rv ) standards were not observed .",
    "relative velocity shifts were generally less than 6  , comparable to the magnitude of the random velocity uncertainties .    we measured an initial ( final for cpr2002  a36 ) radial velocity for each spectrum obtained at wiro using gaussian fits to the  @xmath185876 line via the same method outlined in @xcite , adopting a rest wavelength of 5875.69  measured in model stellar spectra with static atmospheres ( tlusty ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . our fitting code fixes the gaussian width and depth at the mean value determined from all the spectra ( after rejecting outliers ) , and it solves for the best - fit line center . in the case of an sb2 , the code fits a double - gaussian profile where the widths and depths have been fixed independently using observations obtained near quadrature orbital phases .    in this work",

    "one of the strengths of this method is that the radial velocities can be refined via cross correlation after each iteration ( i.e , cross - correlating the residual spectra with the resultant component spectrum as the template ) .",
    "the cross - correlated velocities generally have smaller uncertainties and utilize more lines , leading to a more precise measurement of the stellar velocity and the computed binary systemic velocity .",
    "systemic velocities that are based solely on one hydrogen or helium line , such as  @xmath185876 with cpr2002  a36 , may be blueshifted relative to the true systemic velocity owing to velocity contributions from strong winds .",
    "these contributions are strongest in very early - o stars and evolved stars .",
    "however , radial velocities for schulte  3 are measured from many lines in the blue and red portions of the spectrum .",
    "the radial velocities of mt91  372 and mt91  696 are based on several hydrogen and helium lines between 5400    and 6700   and the stars are neither early - o or evolved .    because of the more sophisticated approach to measuring the radial velocities in this work , the newly determined velocities will vary slightly from our previous works",

    "however , the rms difference of the comparison star mean magnitudes over all observing nights suggests that the night - to - night zero point is uncertain at the 0.010 mag level , which is small compared to the depth of eclipses over the orbital cycle .    for schulte  3 and cpr2002  a36 , we included the nsvs photometry @xcite in addition to the rbo photometry .",

    "schulte  3 ( comprised of 4.74  d eclipsing components `` a '' and `` b '' ) and the companion , schulte  3c , are blended in all of our rbo images , so our photometry using large apertures encompasses all stars .",

    "we also measured the equivalent width ratio using a composite of four spectra obtained near a single quadrature phase ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "the measured ratios were higher using this method , @xmath131 and @xmath132 for the primary and secondary respectively .",
    "we adopted the mean of these ratios , @xmath133 for the primary and @xmath134 for secondary . using the relationship shown in figure  [ ewhe ] , this yields @xmath135  k and @xmath136  k. the primary temperature is similar to the 31,884  k implied by the observational scale of @xcite for an o9.5v .",
    "accordingly , we adopt @xmath137 as a fixed parameter in the phoebe modeling but leave @xmath90 as a free parameter to be fit .    ]    before considering the third light contribution from mt91 696c , we computed the best - fit phoebe model to the photometry that includes this extra component .",
    "we then tested various orbital configurations , and each indicated that the system is just barely detached .",
    "once the code converged on the best - fit solution , we added increasingly larger contributions from third light until phoebe could no longer converge on a solution and the primary eclipse depth exceeded 0.75 magnitudes .",
    "the highest contribution allowed was 14% of maximum out - of - eclipse light ( i.e. , 14% of the v=12.051  mag system ) .",
    "this indicates that the tertiary can not be brighter than about v=14.18  mag .",
    "our ephemeris indicates that the @xmath30 fgs measurement was taken at a phase near maximum light .",
    "the 0.94@xmath50.40  mag offset between the ( a+b ) binary and the brightest astrometric companion , as reported by @xcite , results in a nominal contribution of 22@xmath138%  consistent with the maximum of 14% allowed by the light curve .",
    "we therefore adopt a contribution of 14% for component @xmath139 .",
    "table  [ allfits.tab ] displays the resulting system parameters for the best solution to the mt91  696 system after including a constant 14% third light contribution within the phoebe model and fixed zero eccentricity ( when allowing the eccentricity to vary , bscsp and phoebe both converged on the same zero eccentricity solution ) .",
    "the final orbital period obtained with all radial velocity and light curve information is in excellent agreement with the period reported by @xcite , indicating there has been negligible change in the period over six years .",
    "additionally , while the computed radii ( @xmath140  and @xmath141  ) are slightly smaller than the theoretical values of @xmath142  ( 09.5v ) and @xmath143  ( b0.5v ) , the computed masses ( @xmath144  and @xmath145  ) are in good agreement with the theoretical values of @xmath146  and @xmath147  @xcite . finally , the resulting secondary temperature , @xmath148  k also agrees well with the direct @xmath90 measurement from the  @xmath185411/  @xmath185876 line ratio determined above .",
    "the light curve residuals in the lower panel of figure  [ mt696solution ] show small @xmath1491% systematic variations between phase 0 and 0.25 , suggesting minor deficiencies in the adopted model , but additional high - quality photometry will be needed to further constrain the model parameters .",
    "the computed distance modulus is 10.61@xmath50.10 mag and corresponds to a distance of @xmath104=1.32@xmath50.07 kpc . for this system ,",
    "the largest source of uncertainty on the distance is the uncertainty on the correction for interstellar extinction .",
    "ideally , eclipsing binary distances would make use of detached systems which have simple geometries , i.e. , the stars are spherical and the light curves are unaffected by complications involving mass loss , hot spots produced by radiation or mass transfer streams , and variations in the surface potentials of stars approaching or undergoing roche lobe overflow .",
    "unfortunately , four of the six known eclipsing sb2 systems in the direction of cyg  ob2 contain evolved components and are probable contact or over - contact systems .",
    "therefore , we proceed to model the cpr2002  a36 and schulte  3 eclipsing sb2 systems while cautioning that the interpretation of the velocity curves and light curves is subject to larger uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ a36solution ] shows the best - fit light curve data and model ( top ) , velocity curve data and model ( middle ) , and light curve residuals ( bottom ) for cpr2002  a36 .",
    "the light curve is characteristic of an over - contact system with a difference in eclipse depths that indicates a significant difference in component effective temperatures .",
    "additionally , we see an oconnell effect that results in an @xmath70.04  mag difference in maxima . there is also considerable dispersion in the @xmath150 magnitude at nearly all phases , exceeding the nominal 0.01 mag uncertainties and suggestive of a high level of intrinsic temporal variability . finally ,",
    "because of the over - contact nature of the system , cpr2002  a36 shows strong , varying h@xmath27 emission and a struve - sahade effect in the lines .    ]",
    "the emission and struve - sahade effect are mostly responsible for the disagreement between the observed and calculated radial velocities .",
    "emission partially fills the spectral lines and skews the line centers and is most significant for phases @xmath70.8    1.1 when the secondary is heading into eclipse .",
    "this emission is easiest to see at h@xmath27 , shown in the panel second from right in figure  [ a36phaseseries ] ( colored white in this inverse greyscale image ) , a phased spectral sequence using all of the wiro - longslit spectra folded with the final solution period .",
    "the figure also shows four additional spectral lines in the @xmath17  5400  ",

    "the orange and green curves represent the final primary and secondary solutions , respectively . from a phase of @xmath70.25    0.6 ,",
    "a singular emission feature is evident and appears to be associated with the redshifted secondary . at phase 0.85    1.1 , there appear to be multiple emission components with the dominant one still associated with the secondary . at  @xmath185876 ( middle panel ) , the emission results in the best gaussian fit being centered at a longer wavelength than the true center . because the primary component s absorption is weaker and shifted less , the profiles are more distorted at these phases , and therefore , computed radial velocities are more skewed .",
    "the emission , struve - sahade effect , and oconnell effect may be adequately explained by a hot spot or a stream of optically thin ionized gas near or trailing the secondary .    ]",
    "an advantage to creating a phased spectral image is that weak lines that would normally be difficult to identify amongst the continuum noise and various interstellar / dib lines are more easily identified and associated with the correct component .",
    "for instance ,  @xmath185592 is difficult to identify with certainty in many of cpr2002  a36 s spectra , but its presence is easily revealed in both components in figure  [ a36phaseseries ] .",
    "the full phased spectral image also reveals moderately weak  @xmath175801 , 5812 absorption and very weak  @xmath185696 emission in the primary , the presence and strength of which , with  @xmath185411 , indicate the primary may be slightly hotter than the b0 estimated in @xcite , such as o9  ",
    "o9.5 @xcite .",
    "given the strength of the metal lines in these spectra and of the and lines shown in figure  4 of @xcite , we revise our estimate of the primary s luminosity class to iii and adopt a full spectral classification of o9    o9.5iii . for the secondary ,",
    "the full phased spectral image revealed the presence of weak  @xmath175667 , 5670 , 5680 . given these , the weak  @xmath185411 , and the very weak  @xmath185592 , we revise and adopt the spectral type of o9.5  ",
    "b0iv : for the secondary .",
    "we estimate the effective temperatures for this system in a similar manner to mt91  696 via the ratio of helium equivalent widths .",
    "we measured equivalent widths at both quadrature phases , obtaining @xmath151 and @xmath152 for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "as both components of cpr2002  a36 have been classified as likely evolved , we use the dashed line in figure  [ ewhe ] to estimate the temperatures as @xmath31=29,400  k and @xmath90=29,200  k with uncertainties of approximately 500  k. these estimates are in rough agreement with the theoretical temperatures for an o9iii ( 31,000@xmath5800  k ) and o9.5iv ( 30,800@xmath5500 ) , but disagree with the temperature difference indicated by the difference in eclipse depths .",
    "however , considering the lower signal - to - noise of  @xmath185411 in many of the spectra and the fact that the struve - sahade effect raises the inherent uncertainty in equivalent width measurements of , and given the theoretical temperatures @xcite for the estimated spectral types above , we adopt @xmath153  k for @xmath154 and estimate @xmath155  k for @xmath156 .",
    "our nominal phoebe model is a double - contact configuration with a hot spot on the trailing side of the secondary ( 130  from the point of contact on the equator ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the visibility of the spot coincides well with the presence of emission in figure  [ a36phaseseries ] .",
    "the spot may indicate the transfer of mass from the primary .",
    "the final solution is fit with a spectroscopic period of @xmath157  d and eccentricity fixed at zero .",
    "we were unable to reconcile a phase shift of 0.157 ( 17.6  hr ) between the nsvs photometry and our radial velocity data with phoebe .",
    "therefore , we adopted the ephemeris obtained from bscsp and applied an arbitrary 0.1565 phase shift to the nsvs photometric data .",
    "similarly , we applied an arbitrary 0.0506 phase shift to the rbo @xmath19-band photometry as well .",
    "it is possible that the system has a changing period that we have not accounted for , but its impact is negligible on the results presented here .",
    "additionally , we find that the @xmath19-band photometry and the radial velocity curves are better fit with a slightly higher inclination than the nsvs photometry ( @xmath158  versus @xmath159 ) . because nsvs photometry is filterless and only approximate to johnson - r band @xcite , we adopt the solution with the higher inclination .",
    "this also has negligible impact on the results presented here . in figure",
    "[ a36solution ] , we show the nsvs photometry instead of the @xmath19-band photometry because its full phase coverage better illustrates the solution s overall agreement with the observed light curves .    the final solution yields a secondary temperature of @xmath90=20,600@xmath5600  k , contrasting significantly with the @xmath155  k estimated by helium equivalent width ratios , but relative to @xmath154 , it is in better agreement with the temperature difference indicated from the eclipse depths . no combination of spot parameters and overall model allowed for a higher secondary temperature , but we admit that fitting the spot manually limits the parameter space explored . the computed masses @xmath93=@xmath160  and @xmath94=@xmath161  are in good agreement with the expected values from @xcite . however , the radii , @xmath91=@xmath162  and @xmath92=@xmath163  , are larger than the expected values and more characteristic of o9ii and o9.5iii . however ,",
    "given the uncertainties on the spectral types , and the fact that each component is filling its roche lobe , these values are not entirely surprising . using the computed bolometric magnitudes in table  [ allfits.tab ] , we compute a distance for this system of @xmath3 kpc , where the uncertainty on distance is dominated by the relatively large uncertainty on interstellar extinction ( @xmath164=0.23 mag ) and the uncertainty on primary temperature ( @xmath1652000  k ) .",
    "had we adopted the ccm89 reddening law for cpr a36 instead of fm07 , the resulting distance would drop to 1.27 kpc .",
    "schulte  3 shows many similarities to cpr2002  a36 , including highly variable h@xmath27 emission , a struve - sahade effect , an oconnell effect , and a similar period ( @xmath166  d ) .",

    "this emission is also present in  @xmath185876 , but it is more difficult to see in the figure owing to its weaker presence in the wings around this line .",
    "regardless , the primary component s radial velocities are skewed at these phases for the same reasons given for cpr2002  a36 .",
    "we obtained 20 epochs of wiyn / hydra spectra and 24 epochs of wiro - longslit spectra .",
    "radial velocities were measured for 12 and 19 of these spectra , respectively . however , because of the distorted line profiles we utilized only wiyn radial velocities for the primary and excluded all secondary  @xmath185876 radial velocities near @xmath167 .",

    "the spectrum shows @xmath169 , indicating a temperature class of early to mid - o .",
    "however , taking into account that is underrepresented , the ratio may be closer to unity , indicating a temperature class near o6  ",
    "additionally , the weak with absent , , and , indicates a likely luminosity class of v. the disentangled secondary spectrum shows @xmath170 near unity , indicating a temperature class near o9 , and the strength of and lines relative to the neighboring lines indicates an evolved luminosity class , likely iii    ii .",
    "the disentangled component spectra are shown at top and third from top in figure  [ s3component ] .",
    "the spectra show good agreement with the spectral standards of hd101190 ( o6v ; second from top ) and hd148546 ( o9ia ; bottom ) from the @xcite digital atlas .",
    "we note that hd101190 has a luminosity of ia rather than iii , resulting in stronger metal lines , but it is the closest standard in the library .",
    "interestingly , the secondary luminosity class suggests that the present secondary may have been the more massive component at one point .    as with the other systems , we measured the effective temperatures using the ratio of helium line equivalent widths in spectra obtained near quadrature .",
    "we find that @xmath70 is 1.06@xmath50.06 for the primary and 0.95@xmath50.04 for the secondary . here , the struve - sahade effect either does not impact our equivalent width measurements or it impacts them equally , as the variation in line profile associated with the primary appears to be limited to line depth and width changes only ; the overall equivalent width does not change between quadrature phases . with these equivalent width ratios and the luminosity class estimates , the relations provided in figure  [ ewhe ] yield temperatures of @xmath171  k and @xmath172  k for the primary and secondary , respectively",
    "the secondary estimate is nearly in agreement with the theoretical value of @xmath173  k from @xcite .",
    "however , the primary estimate is lower than the theoretical value for an o6v by approximately 4,000  k , which makes the temperature more appropriate for a slightly later type of o7 @xcite . given that we can not fully quantify the effect that emission plays with the equivalent width ratios , we also consider that the effective temperature may be as high as 38,500  k for the primary .",
    "therefore , we computed a grid of solutions for primary temperatures 34,000  k    38,500  k. in these solutions , the secondary temperatures from @xmath728,000  k    35,500  k depending on spot parameters and model used .",
    "the light curve for schulte  3 is unambiguously characteristic of a contact / overcontact system .",
    "it exhibits relatively small eclipse depths of @xmath70.23  mag and @xmath70.17  mag in the raw light curve , suggesting a moderate inclination . similarly to cpr2002  a36 , the light curve also displays an oconnell effect ( @xmath70.02    0.03  mag ) with a brighter primary maximum and exhibits real photometric variability in excess of the nominal uncertainties .",
    "photometry obtained at similar orbital phase across different orbits exhibit offsets of up to 0.02 mag , signifying intrinsic variability .",
    "this is probably a triple system , and therefore the light curve ( and to some minor extent , the velocity curves ) is further complicated by the presence of schulte  3c which contributes @xmath2412% to the @xmath19-band light .",
    "we used phoebe to account for the third light contribution .",
    "we explored various combinations of temperatures for the primary , secondary , and spot , various spot configurations , and both w - uma and double - contact configuration models for schulte  3 .",
    "because the emission features appear to be associated mainly with the secondary , we placed the relatively large ( 49    60 ) hot spot on that component , with a center between 24  and 45  from the northern pole and between 20  and 35  counter - clockwise from the point of contact . the adopted location of this hotspot coincides well with the presence of emission seen in h@xmath27 . in the end , we adopted the solution with @xmath174  k and @xmath175  k from @xcite because our confidence in the spectral types exceeded that of the compromised equivalent width ratios .",
    "additionally , the spot placement for this solution is nearer to the point of contact ( 45  from the northern pole and centered 35  in the direction of rotation ) than the other models , which makes sense if the primary is heating the secondary .",
    "this solution also provides the most consistent overall picture .",
    "the spot is similar in temperature to the primary ( @xmath176  k ) , just as we would expect if it originates from heating , and both the secondary and combined secondary+spot temperatures ( @xmath177  k ) agree with the value obtained from the less compromised secondary equivalent width ratios . finally , the combined secondary+spot and primary temperatures are in better agreement with the temperature difference implied by the light curves .",
    "this solution yields a distance of 1.32  kpc .    however , if we accept the temperatures estimated strictly from equivalent widths , ( i.e. , @xmath178  k and @xmath179  k ) , then our best fit is a double contact configuration with a spot inclined @xmath723  from the northern pole , centered @xmath720  in the direction of rotation from the point of contact , and with a radius of @xmath749 .",
    "the average secondary+spot temperature is @xmath734,800  k. this does not agree with the significant difference in component temperatures suggested by the light curve .",
    "additionally , the spot temperature required with this geometry is nearly 45,000  k , which may be possible with a mass stream origin but not heating .",
    "the computed distance for this scenario is 1.27  kpc .",
    "the computed distance to all explored configurations was between 1.21  kpc and 1.36  kpc , with the closest distance resulting from a solution with @xmath180  k , @xmath181  k , and @xmath182  k. in all solutions , most light - curve - derived orbital parameters had little variation ( e.g. , @xmath183 , @xmath184  , and @xmath185  ) .",
    "the largest source of variation / uncertainty originates from the temperatures and resultant bolometric magnitudes , with the second largest source being the high uncertainty in interstellar reddening . because of the degeneracies present in this system , when computing uncertainties , we folded in the full variation of all values for all explored configurations .",
    "we provide these with the full list of orbital parameters in table  [ allfits.tab ] and adopt a distance of @xmath4  kpc to schulte  3 .",
    "additionally , the light curve residuals are systematic beyond the stated uncertainties , indicating additional physical effects that are not correctly reproduced in any of the explored models .",
    "the weighted mean distance of the four eclipsing binaries analyzed here is 1.33@xmath50.06 kpc .",
    "the unweighted mean distance is 1.35 kpc .",
    "this value is broadly consistent with the 1.3    1.5 kpc distances measured for radio masers in pre - main - sequence objects in the surrounding molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "it is also in good agreement with the @xcite estimate of 1.3    1.4 kpc toward the massive binary schulte  5 .",
    "however , our mean distance is somewhat smaller than many measurements in the literature which lie in the range 1.4    1.7 kpc .",
    "in particular , @xcite obtained a spectrophotometric distance of 1.45 kpc toward an ensemble of cyg  ob2 stars .",
    "interestingly , @xcite noted that had she adopted the ( at that time , newly revised ) cooler stellar effective temperature scale of @xcite this would place cyg  ob2 at 1.2 kpc ( d.m.=10.44 ) .",
    "she rejected this possibility , concluding that such a small distance would reduce the luminosity of cyg  ob2 o supergiants that have known mass loss rates and create a problem for the theoretical understanding of the mechanisms that drive massive star winds . however , given recent downward revisions of the stellar mass loss rates @xcite it is no longer clear that this is a compelling reason for rejecting a smaller distance .",
    "if we were to adopt the @xcite distance of 1.20 kpc and correct it upward by a factor of 1.08 to account for the additional luminosity of secondary stars in close massive systems as recommended by @xcite , the resulting distance is 1.30 kpc , in excellent agreement with our current eclipsing binary estimate .",
    "we note here that @xcite derived slightly lower extinctions of @xmath186  mag and @xmath187  mag for mt91  372 and mt91  696 , respectively , by using a different set of uv photometry .",
    "if we had adopted these extinctions , it would have increased the resulting distances to these systems to 1.39 and 1.34  kpc , respectively .",
    "the overall weighted mean distance would have risen slightly to @xmath188  kpc .",
    "this small systematic difference is within the uncertainty of our measurement , but it underscores the sensitivity of the distance measurement to the adopted correction for interstellar extinction .    the level of agreement between our four distance measurements is remarkable given the stated ( perhaps overly generous ) uncertainties stemming primarily from uncertainties on effective temperatures and interstellar reddenings . we regard this to be a coincidence given that the analysis of each system has entailed independent measurements of these key observable quantities arising from independent datasets .",
