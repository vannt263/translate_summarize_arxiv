    "one of the open challenges in heavy - ion physics is to gain a precise understanding of the jet - medium dynamics , the jet - medium interactions , and the jet - energy loss formalism . in this letter , we study the impact of the medium and the details of the jet - medium coupling on the pion nuclear modification factor ( @xmath1 ) and the high-@xmath0 elliptic flow ( @xmath2 ) measured at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .    we find that both the background medium and the details of the jet - medium coupling play an important role for the simultaneous description of the @xmath1 and the high-@xmath0 @xmath2 .",
    "this simultaneous description reveals the so - called high-@xmath0 @xmath2-problem @xcite : for various theoretical models @xcite , the high-@xmath0 elliptic flow below @xmath3  gev is about a factor of two below the measured data @xcite .",
    "this effect has been discussed in literature @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown by cujet3.0 @xcite that a jet - medium coupling @xmath4 can solve the high-@xmath0 @xmath2-problem for non - fluctuating initial conditions .",
    "this jet - medium coupling depends on the energy of the jet @xmath5 , the temperature of the medium @xmath6 , and non - equilibrium effects around the phase transition of @xmath7  mev .    in this letter , we contrast results obtained for a background medium determined via the viscous hydrodynamic approach vish2 + 1 @xcite with the parton cascade bamps @xcite and study the impact of the jet - medium coupling @xmath4 derived by cujet3.0 @xcite .",
    "we show that both medium backgrounds lead to surprisingly similar results . however , the background flow fields need to be included in both scenarios to enhance the high-@xmath0 elliptic flow which is otherwise too small . applying",
    "the jet - medium coupling @xmath4 finally leads to a reproduction of the high-@xmath0 @xmath2-data within measured error bars .        with this",
    ", we contrast two completely different background models and demonstrate the importance of the background flow fields and the jet - medium coupling for the correct description of the measured jet observables .",
    "the jet - energy loss model used in this letter ( for convenience referred to as bbmg model ) is based on the generic ansatz @xcite @xmath8 with the jet - energy @xmath5 , the path - length @xmath9 , and the energy density of the background medium @xmath10 .    in case of a radiative perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) energy - loss description used here , the explicit form of eq .",

    "initially , the jets are distributed according to a transverse initial profile given by the bulk flow fields of vish2 + 1 and bamps @xcite .",
    "besides the two background media , we also contrast a jet - medium coupling @xmath22 that depends only on the collision energy @xmath23 with the cujet3.0 jet - medium coupling @xmath4 which depends on the jet energy , the local temperature , and includes possible non - perturbative effects around the phase transition as in ref .",

    "[ fig03 ] demonstrates that the jet - medium coupling @xmath4 suggested by cujet3.0 @xcite can solve the high-@xmath0 @xmath2-problem .",

    "as one can see , the slope of both the @xmath1 and the high-@xmath0 @xmath2 at lhc energies changes when considering non - fluctuating ( @xmath13 ) jet - energy loss distributions . to be more precise ,",
