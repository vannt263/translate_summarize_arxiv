    "a color - magnitude relation is also well established : brighter spheroids are redder ( bower et al . 1992 ) .",

    "( 2004 ) paper for a full account of the model assumptions and their physical justification , we provide here , for the reader s convenience , a brief summary of its main features .",
    "the model follows with simple , physically grounded recipes and a semi - analytic technique the evolution of the baryonic component of proto - spheroidal galaxies within massive dark matter ( dm ) halos forming at the rate predicted by the standard hierarchical clustering scenario within a @xmath1cdm cosmology .",
    "the main novelty with respect to other semi - analytic models is the central role attributed to the mutual feedback between star formation and growth of a super massive black hole ( smbh ) in the galaxy center .",
    "the idea that sn and qso feedback play an important role in the evolution of spheroidal galaxies has been pointed out by several authors ( dekel & silk 1986 ; white & frenk 1991 ; haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 ; silk & rees 1998 ; fabian 1999 ) .",
    "granato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) worked out , for the first time , the symbiotic evolution of the host galaxy and the central black - hole ( bh ) , including the feedback . in this model ,",
    "the formation rate of massive halos ( @xmath21 ) is approximated by the positive part of the time derivative of the halo mass function ( press & schechter 1974 , revised by sheth & tormen 2002 ) .",
    "the gas , heated at virial temperature and moderately clumpy ( clumping factor @xmath22 ) , cools to form stars , especially in the innermost regions where the density is the highest .",
    "the radiation drag due to starlight acts on the cold gas , further decreasing its angular momentum and causing an inflow into a reservoir around the central bh , to be subsequently accreted into it , increasing its mass and powering the nuclear activity . in turn",
    ", the feedbacks from sn explosions and from the active nucleus regulate the star formation rate and the gas inflow , and eventually unbind the residual gas , thus halting both the star formation and the bh growth .",
    "in fact , important parameters are the efficiency of sn energy transfer to the cold gas ( @xmath23 ) and the fraction of the qso luminosity in winds .",
    "further relevant differences with other semi - analytic models are the allowance for a clumping factor , @xmath24 , speeding up the radiative cooling so that even in very massive halos ( @xmath25 ) , the gas , heated to the virial temperature , can cool on a relatively short ( @xmath26@xmath27gyr ) timescale , at least in the dense central regions , and the assumption that the large - scale angular momentum does not effectively slow down the collapse of the gas and the star formation in massive halos virialized at high redshift . as for the latter assumption",
    ", we note that during the fast collapse phase , when the potential well associated with a galactic halo is established , gas clouds can lose their orbital energy to the dark matter by dynamical friction on a timescale shorter than the halo collapse timescale ( see , e.g. , mo & mao 2004 ) .",
    "the model prescriptions are assumed to apply to dm halos virializing at @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "these cuts are meant to crudely single out galactic halos associated with spheroidal galaxies .",
    "disk ( and irregular ) galaxies are envisaged as associated primarily to halos virializing at @xmath30 , some of which have incorporated most halos less massive than @xmath31 virializing at earlier times , that may become the bulges of late type galaxies",
    ". however , the model does not address the formation of disk ( and irregular ) galaxies and these objects will not be considered in this paper .",
    "the kinetic energy fed by supernovae is increasingly effective , with decreasing halo mass , in slowing down ( and eventually halting ) both the star formation and the gas accretion onto the central black hole . on the contrary , star formation and black hole growth proceed very effectively in the more massive halos , giving rise to the bright scuba phase , until the energy injected by the active nucleus in the surrounding interstellar gas unbinds it , thus halting both the star formation and the black hole growth ( and establishing the observed relationship between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion or halo mass ) .",
    "not only the black hole growth is faster in more massive halos , but also the feedback of the active nucleus on the interstellar medium is stronger , to the effect of sweeping out such medium earlier , thus causing a shorter duration of the active star - formation phase .",
    "the basic yields of the model are the star - formation rate , @xmath32 , as a function of the galactic age , @xmath33 , ( hence the evolution of the mass in stars , @xmath34 ) , and the growth of the central bh mass , @xmath35 , for any given value of the halo mass , @xmath36 , and of the virialization redshift , @xmath37 .",

    "the predicted @xmath6@xmath50 relation , at fixed @xmath37 , is immediately translated into @xmath6@xmath5 using the ratio @xmath122 derived from the vdf .",
    "the scatter of data points is interpreted as reflecting the distribution of @xmath37 .",
    "the model also predicts a steepening of the relation at low @xmath5 values , due to the combined effect of sn feedback  which is increasingly efficient with decreasing halo mass in slowing down the gas infall onto the central bh  and of the decreased radiation drag ( due to a decrease of the optical depth ) . from an observational point of view ,",
    "the behavior of the @xmath127@xmath5 relation in the low bh mass and low velocity dispersion regime is still unclear , due to the dearth of data and to the uncertainties on the estimates . in fig .",
    "[ mbhs ] we plot objects found in literature with estimated bh masses @xmath128 .",
    "dynamical measurements are available only for m33 and ngc  205 , while all the other bh masses have been estimated through the linewidth - luminosity - mass scaling relation ( kaspi et al .",
    "therefore the cases of m33 and ngc  205 are particularly interesting , although they are outside the range of masses to which we applied our model up to now . for m33 the upper limit to the bh mass is @xmath129 ( merritt et al .",
    "2001 ) or @xmath130 ( gebhardt et al . 2001 ) , while , for ngc  205 , @xmath131 . both fall below the extrapolation of the @xmath6@xmath5 relation holding at higher @xmath5 ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ; onken et al .",
    "2004 ) , while it is fully consistent with the extrapolation of our model . on the other hand , the bh mass estimates for the faint type 1 seyfert nuclei in ngc 4395 ( filippenko & ho 2003 ) , in pox 52 ( barth et al .",
    "2004 ) and in 7 galaxies drawn from sdss ( greene et al .",
    "2004 ) are only marginally consistent with the steepening predicted by our model .",
    "more data on the so called intermediate mass bhs ( @xmath132 ) in the galactic centers ( see van der marel ( 2003 ) for a review ) are needed to clarify this issue .",
    "of course we should also keep in mind that the low bh mass portion of the diagram might just reflect the distribution of bh seeds ( possibly created by merging of smaller bhs during the fast accretion epoch ) and be only weakly affected by the mass accretion which is controlled by the effects discussed above . for example , koushiappas et al .",
    "( 2004 ) presented a model yielding seed bhs with characteristic masses @xmath133 .",
    "also , low bh masses may be easily increased by substantial factors during later accretion phases , when host galaxies are disk- ( rather than bulge- ) dominated .",
    "another prediction of the abc model is that the ratio of the bh mass to the mass in stars , @xmath134 , is almost insensitive to variations of @xmath37 .",
    "therefore the @xmath127@xmath98 relation is expected to have a smaller _ intrinsic _ scatter ( see fig .",
    "[ nfp ] ) than the @xmath127@xmath5 relation .",
    "this is because , as mentioned above , the growth of the bh mass is controlled by the star formation rate through the radiation drag and the sn feedback , and in turn , the feedback from the active nucleus can eventually sweep out the gas thus halting both the star formation and the accretion on the bh . thus the stellar and bh mass grow ( and stop growing ) in parallel . the parallelism is not exact , however , since the star formation rate has a twofold effect on the bh growth . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath6@xmath98 relation is not strictly linear , but bends down at small masses , and is slightly different for different values of @xmath37 . on the other hand , estimates of @xmath98 are somewhat indirect and therefore liable to larger uncertainties than those of @xmath5 , that can be directly measured ; this may translate in an _ observed _ scatter around the mean @xmath6@xmath98 relation comparable to , or larger than that for the @xmath6@xmath5 relation , in spite of the smaller intrinsic scatter .    in fig .",
    "[ nfp ] we plot the -relation for objects with reliable bulge mass determinations from hring & rix ( 2004 ) .",
    "the agreement between the data , suggesting a slightly non - linear relation ( @xmath135 ) , with our predictions is remarkably good .",
    "as pointed out by hring & rix ( 2004 ) , a significant fraction of the scatter ( which is @xmath136 dex ) can be attributed to measurement errors .",
    "marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) found that the scatter in this relation is reduced to @xmath137 dex , when is estimated as a virial mass ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "the very good fits of the observed @xmath6@xmath5 and relations are additional strong indications that the abc model properly includes the mutual feedbacks of stars and qsos .",
    "it is worth noticing that the model also correctly predicts the local bh mass function in spheroidal galaxies ( granato et al .",
    "2004 ; shankar et al .",
    "we have pointed out an impressively , and unexpectedly , tight correspondence between the virial velocities , @xmath50 , controlled by the dynamics of dark halos , and the stellar velocity dispersions , @xmath5 , that feel the effect of dissipative baryon loading .",
    "a straightforward comparison of the virial velocity distribution , implied by the standard hierarchical clustering scenario in a @xmath1cdm cosmology , with the observed velocity dispersion function of spheroidal galaxies , shows that the two functions match remarkably well for a constant ratio @xmath139 . for a nfw density profile",
    ", this ratio corresponds to a concentration parameter @xmath67 , noticeably close to that found from n - body simulations ( zhao et al .",
    "2003a ) to apply to halos of mass greater than @xmath75 virializing at @xmath76 , with no significant dependence on halo mass .",
    "thus the matter density profile at virialization appears to be essentially unaffected by the subsequent events , including mergers and the dissipative contraction of baryons , consistent with the dynamical attractor hypothesis ( loeb & peebles 2003 ; gao et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the @xmath50@xmath5 relation is a key ingredient to connect theoretical predictions with observations . using the above determination of the @xmath4 ratio",
    ", we have shown that the observed relationships between photometric and dynamical properties of spheroidal galaxies , defining the fundamental plane , carry clear imprints of the feedback processes ruling the early evolution of spheroidal galaxies .",
    "the steeper slope of the luminosity-@xmath5 ( faber - jackson ) relation compared to the predicted @xmath36@xmath50 relation is interpreted as due primarily to the heating of the interstellar medium by supernovae , which increasingly hampers star - formation in smaller and smaller halos , and to winds driven by the active nucleus , that eventually sweep out the residual interstellar gas in the most massive nuclei .",
    "a full analysis shows that the treatment of feedback adopted in the abc model nicely accounts not only for the slope , but also for the normalization of the faber - jackson relation ( see fig .  [ fj ] ) .",
    "the model implies that the observed scatter is mostly intrinsic and due to the spread of virialization redshifts .",
    "it also predicts a moderate steepening of the relation at low masses . to our knowledge , this is the first semi - analytic model for which simultaneous fits of the epoch dependent luminosity functions and of the faber - jackson relation have been reported .",
    "the effect of feedback also determines the slope of the luminosity - effective radius relation . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec_fj ] , the feedback yields , approximately , @xmath140 . then , taking into account eq .",
    "( [ borri ] ) , neglecting @xmath109 and with @xmath141 , we get , from @xmath142 ( for given @xmath37 ) , @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "weighting with the redshift distributions appropriate for each value of @xmath47 ( high-@xmath90 galaxies contribute more to low @xmath47 s ) , the mean @xmath120@xmath47 relationship flattens towards the observed relation @xmath145 ( bernardi et al .",
    ". a further flattening is predicted at low @xmath47 values , where the sn feedback dominates , yielding , approximately , @xmath146 , whence @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "again , the model correctly reproduces not only the slope but also the normalization of the relation ( see fig .  [ lre ] ) .",
    "as in the case of the faber - jackson relation , we expect a scatter comparable to the observed one due to the different virialization redshifts .",
    "although the @xmath120@xmath47 and the faber - jackson relation do not provide independent tests of the model ( see sect .",
    "3.3 ) it is reassuring that two different data sets consistently confirm that it yields the correct virial mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the evolution of the stellar component is tied to that of the central black hole , and therefore the @xmath6@xmath5 relation is also shaped by the effect of feedback , primarily from the active nucleus itself in the more massive systems , and from supernovae in smaller objects .",
    "again , observations are well reproduced ( see fig .  [ mbhs ] ) , the dispersion around the best - fit relation is expected to be largely due to the different virialization redshifts , and a steepening of the @xmath127@xmath5 is expected for low bh masses , if these are mostly due to accretion interrelated with the bulge formation .",
    "however , small bh masses may be substantially increased by later accretion , occurring when the host galaxy is disk - dominated . moreover , according to some analyses , seed bh masses may be @xmath149 , and the low-@xmath5 portion of the diagram is testing more the distribution of seed masses than the accretion history .    we have further pointed out that the @xmath6@xmath98 relationship is essentially independent of @xmath37 ( see fig .  [ nfp ] ) ; its _ intrinsic _ scatter should therefore be minimum , although this does not necessarily translate in a low _ observed _ scatter due to the large uncertainties on the @xmath98 estimates ( compared to those on @xmath5 ) .    a synoptic view of the effect of feedback on the luminosity-@xmath5 relation , on the local @xmath112-band luminosity function , and on the @xmath6@xmath5 relation , based on the abc model , is provided by fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ] .",
    "if we switch off the supernova feedback ( central panel row ) , we get a larger luminosity at fixed virial velocity @xmath50 .",
    "the increase is of @xmath150 1 mag . for low luminosity / mass galaxies ( @xmath151 ) , where the stellar feedback is dominating over the qso feedback , and of 0.5 mag . at high luminosities ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "turning off the qso feedback ( bottom panel row ) goes in the same direction , but now the effect is larger for larger galaxies . to fit the observed relation with no stellar or qso feedback , we have to shift by 0.1 dex the @xmath153 ratio , but this is inconsistent with the observed vdf .    as shown by the central panel column of fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ] , the shift to higher luminosities occurring when the feedback is switched off affects only weakly the low luminosity portion of the luminosity function , because of its flat slope . on the other hand",
    ", the high luminosity tail is very sensitive to it , and particularly to the feedback from the active nuclei .    on the whole ,",
    "the local luminosity function of galaxy spheroids and the observed correlations between their properties provide clear evidence that the feedback both from supernovae and from active nuclei plays a key role in the evolution of these sources , and yield rather stringent constraints on the parameters controlling the coupling of the energy injected into the interstellar medium .",
