    "super massive black hole binaries ( smbhbs ) are likely to be the most powerful sources of gravitational waves in the universe",
    ". the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa )  @xcite will be able to detect these systems out to the edge of the visible universe . by studying smbhb inspirals we may gain insight into the galaxy merger history and the role that black holes play in structure formation .",
    "smbhb inspirals and their subsequent mergers also provide fertile ground for performing tests of general relativity  @xcite .    to date",
    ", most data analysis development work for lisa has focused on extreme mass ratio inspirals  @xcite and the galactic confusion problem  @xcite .",
    "smbhb inspirals have received relatively little attention , perhaps in part because they are not expected to pose much of a challenge .",
    "the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method has emerged as a leading algorithm for lisa data analysis .",
    "the mcmc method can efficiently explore large parameter spaces , perform model comparisons , estimate instrument noise , while simultaneously providing error estimates for the recovered parameters .",
    "mcmc techniques have been applied to ground based gravitational wave data analysis  @xcite ; a toy lisa problem  @xcite ; and the extraction of multiple overlapping galactic binaries from simulated lisa data  @xcite . here",
    "we make an initial foray into the smbhb inspiral problem , and compare the parameter recovery accuracy of an mcmc search to the predictions of the fisher information matrix .",
    "considerable work has been done on using the fisher information matrix to make predictions about lisa s resolving abilities for smbhbs  @xcite , so it is interesting to see how reliable those estimates might be .",
    "we find that the fisher matrix approach yields very good estimates for the angular resolution and distance uncertainties , and that it tends to overestimate the errors in the component masses and the time of coalescence .",
    "in this study we employ restricted post - newtonian ( pn ) waveforms , which neglect the higher order harmonics , and treat the phase to 2-pn order  @xcite . the detector response is modeled using the low frequency approximation  @xcite .",
    "the gravitational waveform for a supermassive black hole system consisting of two schwarzschild black holes is described by a 9-d parameter set , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the chirp mass , @xmath2 is the reduced - mass , @xmath3 give the sky location , @xmath4 is the time - to - coalescence , @xmath5 is the inclination of the orbital plane of the binary , @xmath6 is the phase of the gravitational wave at coalescence , @xmath7 is the luminosity distance and @xmath8 is the polarization angle of the gravitational wave .",
    "we will describe the parameters @xmath9 as being extrinsic , while all the rest will be described as being intrinsic  @xcite .",
    "we should mention that @xmath3 and @xmath10 would normally be classed as extrinsic , but they become quasi - intrinsic due to the motion of the lisa observatory .",
    "we focus our attention on a particular smbhb system consisting of a @xmath11 binary system at @xmath12 .",
    "this gives corresponding values of @xmath13 .",
    "the other parameters are defined by @xmath14 radians .",
    "we choose @xmath15 years , and set the time of observation to be @xmath16 years .",
    "we used a sample cadence of 800 seconds . due to the the fact that the equations describing the phase evolution of the wave break down before we reach the last stable circular orbit ( lso ) , we terminate the waveforms at @xmath17 .",
    "the source has a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath18450 .",
    "the one - sided noise spectral density for a lisa michelson channel is given in the low frequency limit by @xmath19 , \\ ] ] where @xmath20 kms is the arm - length for lisa , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the position and acceleration noise respectively . using this formula , we generate instrumental noise from a gaussian distribution . in figure  [",
    "fig : spn ] we display the power spectrum of the lisa response to the system we are investigating with instrumental noise from one channel of lisa .",
    "our analysis uses lisa as a two channel detector , where the detectors are rotated by a factor of @xmath23 with respect to one another  @xcite .",
    "we also assume that lisa has a lower frequency cutoff of @xmath24 hz .",
    "in the bayesian framework of data analysis , the goal is to calculate the posterior probability density functions for the parameters of the model , given the parameter priors and the data .",
    "however , this is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to do analytically .",
    "the advantage of the mcmc method is that it allows one to map out the posterior numerically .",
    "our mcmc approach is implemented by using a metropolis - hastings algorithm to map out the posterior distributions of the 9-d parameter space for super massive black holes .",
    "the method works as follows : we assume that we have already run a search chain that has found the system we are looking for .",
    "we use the true parameter values as the starting point for our chain @xmath25 .",
    "the algorithm then suggests a jump to a new point @xmath26 using a proposal distribution @xmath27 .",
    "we evaluate the hastings ratio @xmath28 and accept the jump with probability @xmath29 , otherwise the chain stays at its current position . here",
    "@xmath30 are the priors of the parameters and @xmath31 is the likelihood .",
    "we use uniform priors for all the parameters .",
    "the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 were taken to be uniform in the range @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 were taken to be uniform in the range @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 and @xmath41 were taken to be uniform in the range @xmath42 $ ] , and @xmath8 was taken to be uniform in the range @xmath43 $ ] . the log - likelihood for a template @xmath44 given a signal @xmath45",
    "was assumed to have the form @xmath46 here the angular brackets define the standard noise weighted inner product . in order to achieve a healthy acceptance rate for the proposed jumps , we use a proposal distribution given by a multivariate normal distribution that is the product of independent normal distributions in each of the 9 eigendirection of the fisher matrix , @xmath47 .",
    "the fisher information matrix describes the expectation value of the curvature of the log likelihood function at maximum likelihood : @xmath48 here the over line indicates the expectation value .",
    "we used a generalized notion of the fisher matrix by employing the definition @xmath49 for points @xmath25 away from maximum likelihood .",
    "the standard deviation in each eigendirection of @xmath47 was set to equal @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "the factor of @xmath53 ensures that the typical jumps are @xmath54 for the full multivariate normal distribution . in principle",
    "this choice of proposal distribution should yield a @xmath55 acceptance rate for the proposed jumps . in practice we found an acceptance rate of @xmath56 for the system",
    "being studied .",
    "the lower acceptance rate is due to the fisher matrix slightly overestimating the uncertainties in one of the eigendirections , and to a slight error in the estimate of the orientation of the corresponding eigendirection .",
    "we started the chain with parameter values close to their true values , but offset by @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the offset in each parameter was chosen to be @xmath18tens of standard deviations away from the true source parameters ( as estimated by the fisher information matrix ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : burn ] we see that the chain underwent a burn - in phase during the first 10,000 steps , before settling in close to the true source parameters . in repeated trials we found that the chain always settled in to the same region of parameter space after the burn - in",
    "was completed . when the chain was started off far from the true parameters",
    "the burn - in time became prohibitively long , so we do not recommend that the current algorithm be used for blind searches .",
    "we have developed a non - markovian variant of the algorithm that can efficiently handle the search phase  @xcite .",
    "the posterior distribution functions derived after the full search are identical to those found in the current paper .    following the burn - in ,",
    "the chain was run for another @xmath66 points to explore the posterior distribution function .",
    "this took 8 days on a single 2 ghz processor .",
    "the first million points of the exploration phase of the chain are shown in figure  [ fig : chains ] .",
    "we see that the mcmc chain moves around well , and show clear evidence of the high degree of correlation between the parameters @xmath67 and @xmath41 .",
    "the straight , solid line in each panel of figure  [ fig : chains ] denotes the mean value of the parameter , as calculated from the chain . taking this mean value",
    ", we then calculated the standard deviation as predicted by the fisher matrix at that point .",
    "this @xmath68 error is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "the two dashed lines in each panel denote the @xmath71 errors in each of the parameters .    in figure  [",
    "fig : histograms ] we have plotted the 1-d marginalized histograms for each of the parameters . the solid line is the fisher matrix prediction for the error at the mean of each chain .",
    "we can see that most of the extrinsic parameter histograms match the fisher prediction almost perfectly .",
    "this is also the case for the @xmath3 parameters .",
    "however , we can see that the histograms for @xmath72 all differ from the prediction of the fisher matrix .",
    "we attribute the error in the fisher matrix prediction to the high degree of correlation between these parameters . in order to see",
    "just how correlated these parameters are , in figure  [ fig:2dhistograms ] we plot the 2-d marginalized histograms for the combinations @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "we found that the fisher matrix has a small eigenvalue in the @xmath72 direction which dominates the contribution to the proposed jumps in these parameters .",
    "the fisher matrix tends to under estimate the eigenvalue in this direction , and it is also slightly off in predicting the corresponding eigendirection . similar behavior was seen in all the examples we have looked at , which suggests that the fisher matrix estimates for the uncertainties in the component masses found in the literature may be systematically high by about a factor of two .    in a closely related study that appears in these same proceedings , wickham , stroeer & vecchio  @xcite",
    "use a reversible jump mcmc routine to study the posterior parameter distributions of a smbhb system .",
    "they used a simplified model of the smbhb waveform , which removes the reduced mass from the parameter set .",
    "in contrast to our findings , they found that the fisher matrix significantly underestimated the uncertainties in many of the model parameters .",
    "we do not know why our results are so different , but we do not think it is due to the differences in our mcmc implementations .",
    "the reverse jump method should yield the same results as our standard mcmc implementation when applied to models with fixed numbers of parameters .",
    "we have found that it is possible to construct a simple mcmc sampler for studying the posterior distribution functions for smbhb inspirals in the lisa data streams .",
    "the marginalized posterior distributions recovered from the markov chains are in good to fair agreement with the fisher matrix predictions . in another work  @xcite , we have developed an advanced mcmc search routine that is capable of performing a blind search of the lisa data for smbhb inspirals .",
