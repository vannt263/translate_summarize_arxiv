    "detectors in experiments of tibet @xcite and grapes3 @xcite enclose plastic scintillators in pyramidal light enclosures . both of these experiments also have scintillation detectors with optical fibers@xcite .",
    "time resolution of scintillators with light enclosure is better than scintillators with wls fiber readouts , since wls has a large contribution in time resolution due to the decay time of wls . on the other hand , scintillators with wls",

    "choosing detectors configuration depends on the requirements of the experiment and the budget restrictions .",
    "the alborz air shower observatory at the sharif university of technology ( @xmath3n , @xmath4e , 1200 m a.s.l , @xmath5 ) will have 30 installed detectors ( 20 scintillators and 10 cherenkov detectors ) .",

    "if the height of the enclosure is small , the pmt is very close to the center of the scintillator ( and consequently far from the corners ) , therefore it is not possible to have an acceptable uniformity . by increasing the height of the light enclosure , uniformity of the detector from center ( cell 1 in fig .",

    "the main differences in the spectra are the number of total counts under the peak , and the width of the peak . in computing the total counts under the peak for each spectrum , very low background counts ( obtained from channels far from the peaks )",

    "slope of the line is 0.11  ns / cm , which means that the fwhm of the time lag distributions increases significantly from the center to the corner of the detector(about 2.26  ns ) .",
    "mean value of fwhm for each height of the light enclosure can be calculated using the following equation : @xmath17 where the summation is over the 6 swept cells ( fig .  [",

    "it is clear that the lower value of @xmath24 indicates better time response of the detector .",
    "therefore , the 20 cm light enclosure with fwhm of 4.35 ns has the best time resolution ( table [ tab : table0 ] ) .",

    "if the uniformity is the main concern , the 30  cm light enclosure should be chosen , however , because of its lower efficiency and higher @xmath24 , this light enclosure is not suitable .",
    "therefore a 20  cm height is selected for the light enclosure of the detector .",
    "a simulation of what happens in the detectors enables us to understand the detection process in more detail . when a charged particle passes through the detector , it loses some or all of its kinetic energy in the scintillator .",
    "small fraction of the lost energy will be converted into fluorescent light and the remainder will be dissipated nonradiatively , primarily in the form of lattice vibrations and heat @xcite .",
    "the number of scintillation photons can be calculated by using the light yield of the scintillator ( available in the literature ) . in the simulation",

    "run time of the program , emission time of photons is calculated only for photons reaching pmt , after finishing other steps of the simulation .",
    "each emitted photon chooses a stochastic direction and passes inside the detector .",
    "it is annihilated by two ways : ( 1 ) absorption by the inner surfaces of the light enclosure or its bottom surface ( i.e. , the surface directly beneath the large area scintillator ) , and ( 2 ) attenuation inside the plastic scintillator .",
    "the inner surface of the light enclosure is diffuse white , and its bottom surface is made of aluminium foil . by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy ( drs ) test ,",
    "their absorption coefficients are about 0.2 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "a signal can be produced by photons reaching pmt .",
    "the whole process can be summarized in the following algorithm :    1 .",
    "based on the path length of a particle inside the scintillator , the number of created photons can be obtained .",

    "the photon path is followed until it hits the surface of the scintillator .",
    "if @xmath45 is greater than the critical angle , it will undergo total internal reflection , i.e. , it will be mirrored inside the scintillator .",
    "otherwise , it will get out of the scintillator . by using the geometry of the detector ( pyramidal shape of the light enclosure ) and equations of the detector surfaces , distance between start point and",

    "4 .   at this stage",
    ", four different cases can happen : + a. the photon is attenuated inside the scintillator , + b. the photon is absorbed in one of the surfaces , + c. the photon reaches pmt , or + d. the photon is still alive and should be followed up .",

    "otherwise , in case d , the photon is not absorbed in the surfaces and it should be reflected in a new random direction , so we go back to step 2 . for photons reaching pmt , the emission time also should be added to the time of flight .",
    "if for any reason the photon does not reach the pmt after 200 ns , the program does not follow this photon , and goes to the next photon .    to consider the absorption of photons in the walls and the bottom surface of the light enclosure , a generated uniform random number @xmath47 $ ]",

    "<S> an area of about 30@xmath040 m@xmath1 will be covered by 20 plastic scintillation detectors ( each with an area of 50@xmath050 cm@xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a series of experiments have been performed to optimize the height of light enclosures of the detectors for this array and the results have been compared to an extended code simulation of these detectors . </S>",
    "<S> operational parameters of the detector obtained by this code are cross checked by geant4 simulation . </S>",
    "<S> there is a good agreement between extended - code and geant4 simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we also present further discussions on the detector characteristics , which can be applicable for all scintillation detectors with a similar configuration .    </S>",
