    "consider a smooth family of planar differential equations @xmath5",
    "@xmath6 for which the existence of at most one limit cycle is already known and moreover all the bifurcations occurring in the family are well understood . for this family we could say that the _ qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations _ has achieved all its goals and all the job is done .",
    "nevertheless , from an analytic and quantitative point of view there remains a crucial question : to determine the bifurcation curves in the bifurcation diagram of the family .",
    "some of these bifurcation curves are not difficult to find .",
    "this is the case for instance of the curves that control the changes in the behavior of the flow near the critical points .",
    "these bifurcation curves correspond to local phenomena and so , in principle , are easier to study .",
    "a paradigmatic example of this kind is the bifurcation curve associated to the birth of a limit cycle due to an andronov - hopf bifurcation .",
    "the curves governing global phenomena are in general much more difficult to determine .",
    "this is , for instance , the case of the appearance of homoclinic or heteroclinic connections .",
    "we propose a method that , in some cases , allows to obtain explicit lower and upper bounds in the parameter plane for the location of the bifurcation curves associated to these global phenomena . as illustration",
    ", we will apply it to two 2-parametric families of quadratic systems having at most one limit cycle .",
    "since our examples are polynomial , we will consider their phase portraits on the poincar sphere , see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap .  3.10 ) , and the homoclinic or heteroclinic connections will also take into account the critical points at infinity .",
    "we start by giving a description of the method for finding the relation between the parameters @xmath0 for which this homoclinic or heteroclinic connection exists . as a first step we consider an algebraic curve @xmath7 as general as possible , but having some of the geometrical properties of the phase portrait of the system .",
    "for instance , it has to pass through the two critical points of the vector field that are connected by the heteroclinic orbit ; if the critical point is a saddle it has to be tangent to one of its separatrices ; if the critical point is at infinity , it has to have a branch going to infinity in the direction corresponding to this point , etc .",
    "the second step consists in using all the free parameters in @xmath8 to impose that , near the critical points , the curve be as close as possible to the separatrix connecting orbit . in most cases",
    "this can be done by finding a local analytical expression of this separatrix in the neighborhood of each critical point .",
    "there are several possibilities to impose that @xmath8 be as close as possible to the separatrix . if the separatrix is a heteroclinic orbit we can fix all the free parameters of @xmath8 imposing this condition only in the neighborhood of one of the critical points or in the neigbourhood of both critical points at the same time .",
    "if the separatrix is a homoclinic orbit we can impose the condition only on one of the branches of the orbit that arrives to the critical point or on the two at the same time . in the two families of quadratic systems studied in the next sections all these possibilities will be explored .",
    "once all the parameters of the curve @xmath8 are fixed , we impose one more level of closeness between both objects ( the connecting orbit and the algebraic curve ) by forcing a relation among the parameters @xmath9 . this procedure gives a curve @xmath10 in the bifurcation space .",
    "in fact , up to this point the method proposed is essentially the one followed in  @xcite to obtain analytic approximations to separatrices for some two - point boundary value problems .",
    "the last step is our main contribution and is the one that leads to explicit algebraic upper and lower bounds of the bifurcation curve associated to the existence of connections between the two critical points .",
    "this is the most difficult and computationally involved part of the method .",
    "we have to prove that there are parameters @xmath0 near the curve @xmath11 such that the corresponding curves @xmath8 are without contact for the flow of the vector field and moreover that there are values for which the flow crosses the curve in one sense and values for which the crossing is in the opposite direction .",
    "this will be clearer in our applications .",
    "notice that the aim of our work is in the spirit of what coppel proposed in his well - known paper @xcite :  ideally one might hope to characterize the phase portraits of quadratic systems by means of algebraic inequalities on the coefficients \" , taking into account the results of @xcite where the authors proved that there are bifurcation curves in quadratic systems which are neither algebraic nor analytic . since there is no hope to find analytic or algebraic expressions of the bifurcation curves , we try to sandwich them between two algebraic curves .",
    "we present below our main results .",
    "the first one deals with a family of quadratic systems already studied in @xcite and the second one with the bogdanov - takens system . for both systems",
    "there is at most one ( hyperbolic ) limit cycle .",
    "the value @xmath12 corresponds , for each @xmath3 , to the value where this limit cycle , which is born in an andronov - hopf bifurcation , disappears giving rise to a heteroclinic or homoclinic connection , respectively , see more details in the next sections .",
    "[ main1 ] let @xmath12 be the bifurcation curve corresponding to the heteroclinic connection for the quadratic system @xmath13 with @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "then :    a.   for @xmath16 @xmath17 b.   for @xmath18 @xmath19 c.   for @xmath20 @xmath21    [ mainbt ] let @xmath12 be the bifurcation curve corresponding to the saddle loop homoclinic connection for the bogdanov - takens system @xmath22 with @xmath23 then @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is an analytic function",

    "our main contributions are items ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "notice that they improve the well - known local knowledge of the function @xmath30 proved for instance in @xcite by using a blowing - up process and scaling of the time and the computation of a melnikov function . in section  [ s3.3 ]",
    "we compare them with other results of perko obtained in the mentioned paper  @xcite .",
    "finally , in subsection  [ seckorea ] we prove that @xmath31 we use this information to improve the results of  @xcite .",
    "this subsection also serves to show how to use our approach when the problem that we face depends only on one parameter .    at the best of our knowledge",
    ", it is the first time that this type of results are obtained for global bifurcation problems .",
    "our starting point is the following theorem :            essentially its proof follows from @xcite and the theory of rotated vector fields @xcite . see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the property @xmath40 is a consequence of the fact that the transformation @xmath41 changes the sign of @xmath42 and @xmath3 in system  .",
    "we work with the expression   of the bogdanov - takens system .",
    "recall that the limit cycle is born , via a hopf bifurcation , when @xmath49 and @xmath42 decreases .",
    "hence , by using the non - intersection property of the limit cycles of a semi - complete family of rotated vector fields it suffices to prove that , when either @xmath50 or @xmath51 , system has no limit cycles . when @xmath50 , note that the line @xmath52 is invariant by the flow of , because @xmath53 where @xmath54 in other words , @xmath55 is an invariant algebraic curve with cofactor @xmath56    assume that , when @xmath50 , system   has a limit cycle @xmath57 with period @xmath58 .",
    "since the divergence of the system is @xmath59 the characteristic exponent of @xmath60 is @xmath61 on the other hand notice that from   we get that @xmath62 hence @xmath63 and so @xmath60 would be a hyperbolic stable limit cycle .",
    "this fact is in contradiction with the known results , see for instance figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "hence the limit cycle does not exist in this case .    to end the proof let us show that @xmath64 it is well - known that the stability of a hyperbolic saddle loop is given by the sign of the divergence at the saddle point , see ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "xi ) . in our case ,",
    "the divergence at the saddle point is @xmath65 . for the bogdanov takens system ,",
    "when the loop exists it is hyperbolic and unstable .",
    "hence it holds that @xmath66 , as we wanted to prove .",
    "system has a focus or a node at the point @xmath70 and a saddle point at the origin .",
    "the linear approximation to its separatrices at the origin is given by the two lines : @xmath71 or equivalently , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is one of the values @xmath74    as in the proof of theorem  [ main1 ] we start by finding the first terms in the taylor expansion of the separatrices of a critical point .",
    "in this occasion the critical point is the origin . in its neighborhood",
    "we can write these separatrices as @xmath75 where @xmath73 is one of the values @xmath76 , or in other words , @xmath77 the next terms can be found recurrently by imposing that @xmath78 we have , for instance , @xmath79 we remark that @xmath80 never vanishes for @xmath81    now we consider a cubic algebraic curve of the form @xmath82 and we search the four free coefficients by imposing that @xmath83 be as close as possible to the separatrices of the saddle point .",

    "we compute the resultant of @xmath95 and @xmath96 with respect to @xmath97 this a very huge task .",

    ", for @xmath87 small enough , the two roots of the quadratic polynomial in @xmath110 are positive and so the curve @xmath84 is without contact , for @xmath87 small enough , in @xmath111 to know until which values of @xmath87 this last property holds we fix @xmath112 and study the signs of the functions @xmath113",
    "@xmath114    as an example we give some details for @xmath115 it can be seen that the degrees of @xmath116 and @xmath117 are 180 and 184 , respectively .",
    "notice that the above expression does not change sign when @xmath118 does not change sign .",
    "hence we have to study the zeroes of this function which is a polynomial in @xmath87 .",
    "this can be done analytically by using its sturm sequence .",
    "the smallest positive root of the polynomial which also vanishes   is @xmath119 .",
    "hence we have proved that for @xmath120 it holds that @xmath121 similarly we can prove that , on the interval @xmath122 , @xmath123 as a consequence , the curve @xmath84 with @xmath42 given in , @xmath124 and @xmath125 is without contact in @xmath126 it is easy to prove that for @xmath87 sufficiently small the curve @xmath84 has a loop in the half - plane @xmath94 .",
    "moreover with the same type of algebraic methods that we have used above it can be seen that the loop also exists in the interval @xmath127 .",
    "furthermore , in this half - plane the loop is crossed transversally by the flow of , inwards when @xmath128 and outwards when @xmath129 hence we have proved that when @xmath130 and @xmath125 it holds that @xmath131 from these inequalities the statement ( i ) of the theorem follows by noticing that @xmath132      clearly the ideas of the method used to prove theorem  [ mainbt].(i ) can be applied when the curve @xmath84 given in is taken of higher degree .",

    "in particular we can not obtain a compact expression of the resultant that would give a proof that @xmath137 is without contact in the half - plane @xmath126 nevertheless , once @xmath3 is fixed we can perform all the computations and prove for instance that for @xmath138 @xmath139 and for @xmath140 @xmath141    in any case , we will prove that the expression   gives us , at least locally , the function @xmath43 .",
    "this can be done by introducing the new variables @xmath142 and @xmath143 as @xmath144 this change of variables is motivated by equation .",
    "notice that by using them , @xmath145 now we repeat all the procedure developed in the previous subsection but with the curve @xmath146 given in and these new variables . by forcing the curve @xmath146 to coincide as much as possible with both separatrices of the saddle point ( four conditions of contact with one of them and five with the other one ) we determine all the parameters of the quartic . after",
    "that we obtain the relation @xmath147 that ensures one more level of closeness between one of the separatrices and the algebraic curve , for @xmath148 sufficiently small .",
    "fortunately , with these new variables it is now possible to explicitly get the resultant @xmath149 between @xmath150 and @xmath151 with respect to @xmath152 .",
    "we obtain that @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are rational functions in @xmath156 and @xmath157 to have an idea of their complexity we introduce the following notation : we will say that a rational function @xmath158 is of type @xmath159 if after simplifying it , its numerator has monomials of degree between @xmath160 and @xmath161 and its denominator between @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",

    "in particular @xmath180 if we fix any of the two values @xmath181 it holds that @xmath182 does not vanish if @xmath148 and @xmath183 are small enough .",
    "this implies that shrinking , if necessary , the value of @xmath148 we obtain that the oval of the algebraic curve @xmath184 which lies in the negative half plane @xmath185 and starts and ends at the origin , is without contact with the flow of the system ( except at @xmath186 ) .",
    "notice that this oval is born from the cusp point existing when @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "the fact that the resultant between @xmath137 and @xmath189 has different sign when @xmath190 and when @xmath191 induces to think that the flow crosses the oval outwards in one case of plus sign and inwards in the other one . to prove this fact it suffices to check this property , for each case , on a single point of the oval .",
