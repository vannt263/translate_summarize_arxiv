    "the observation of transverse single spin asymmetries ( ssas ) in various hard scattering processes has stimulated new remarkable developments both on the theoretical and the experimental side . as a consequence ,",
    "the study of ssas currently represents a very active field of research  @xcite .",
    "the interest in such effects is essentially twofold : first , ssas allow one to address the parton structure of the nucleon beyond the collinear parton model approximation .",
    "second , ssas are ideal observables in order to further explore in which cases the machinery of qcd factorization still applies and in which cases , in its simplest form , it breaks down ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .    for what concerns the parton structure of the nucleon , in the present work we focus on collinear twist-3 quark - gluon - quark correlations . to be more precise , the central non - perturbative correlator is the so - called etqs ( efremov - teryaev - qiu - sterman ) matrix element  @xcite @xmath0  and its chiral - odd partner @xmath1  which typically appears when describing transverse ssas in the context of collinear higher - twist factorization .",
    "the machinery of collinear twist-3 factorization was pioneered already in the early 1980 s  @xcite , and in the meantime frequently applied to transverse spin effects in hard semi - inclusive reactions ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the transverse single spin asymmetry in the angular distribution of a drell - yan dilepton pair .",
    "this asymmetry is defined as the difference of two spin dependent cross sections with opposite directions of transverse polarization divided by their sum , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a solid angle element of the leptons in a dilepton rest frame , and the azimuthal angle @xmath4 is measured relative to the transverse spin vector .",
    "note that the transverse momentum @xmath5 of the dilepton pair is integrated out , and we emphasize that integrating over @xmath5 is essential for applying the collinear factorization approach in the present case .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath6 was already studied in several previous articles , and various different results were obtained .",
    "the first calculation , carried out in the light - cone gauge , can be found in ref .",
    "the authors obtained@xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the standard unpolarized twist-2 parton distribution for quark flavor @xmath10 . the momentum fraction @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 , with @xmath13 denoting the square of the _ cm _ energy of the process .",
    "later on the presence of the derivative term in the numerator of  ( [ eq : hts ] ) was doubted , and it was argued that the correct result for @xmath6 should be  @xcite @xmath14 afterwards , in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath6 was considered in the collinear twist-3 approach , and the result of that study agreed with the expression in  ( [ eq : bmt ] ) .",
    "then @xmath6 was computed by using factorization in terms of transverse momentum dependent correlators  @xcite .",
    "the final outcome of that work neither agreed with  ( [ eq : hts ] ) nor with  ( [ eq : bmt ] ) .",
    "more recently , @xmath6 was again considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors claimed that the spin - dependent hadronic tensor should be multiplied by a factor of 2 compared to previous work  @xcite .",
    "the controversy about the derivative term was not addressed in  @xcite .",
    "this somewhat unclear situation motivated us to revisit this topic .",
    "we computed @xmath6 in  ( [ eq : an ] ) by means of twist-3 collinear factorization and came up with yet another result . to be specific ,",
    "our result is just half of the one quoted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bmt ] ) .",
    "an important difference in comparison to previous work is that , when performing the collinear expansion in the twist-3 formalism , we take into account the dependence on transverse parton motion ( @xmath15-dependence ) not only in the hadronic tensor but also in the lepton tensor . in order to gain further confidence we checked our calculation in a few different ways .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as the follows . in the next section",
    ", we introduce our notation , and give some details about the kinematics . in section  3 ,",
    "we derive the asymmetry in a covariant gauge as well as in the light cone gauge , and the two results agree with each other .",
    "in addition , we have checked the electromagnetic gauge invariance by explicit calculation .",
    "we summarize the paper in section  4 .",
    "we focus on lepton pair production in hadronic scattering which comes from the decay of a virtual photon , @xmath16 .",
    "the 4-momenta of the leptons are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and @xmath19 denotes the momentum of the virtual photon .",
    "the invariant mass of the dilepton pair is @xmath20 with @xmath21 . for the following calculation",
    "we need to introduce the vector @xmath22 . in any dilepton rest frame",
    ", @xmath23 reads @xmath24 where the numerical values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 depend on the frame .",
    "the correlation associated with @xmath6 in  ( [ eq : an ] ) is @xmath27 , while the asymmetry usually associated with the sivers effect  @xcite is related to the correlation @xmath28 .",
    "the latter requires to measure the transverse momentum @xmath5 of the dilepton pair .",
    "a convenient way of sorting out the different angular dependences of the drell - yan cross section is to decompose the lepton tensor in terms of individual independent orthogonal tensors  @xcite , @xmath29 ( a discussion of the general structure of the polarized drell - yan cross section can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) the @xmath30 represent the angular structures , and the basis tensors @xmath31 can be constructed from a set of ( 4-dimensional ) basis vectors @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , which are mutually orthogonal to each other and are normalized according to @xmath36 , @xmath37 . for the case of @xmath6 ,",
    "the relevant angular structures appear in the terms associated with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 like in the case of  ( [ eq : r ] ) , the decomposition  ( [ eq : dec_2 ] ) holds in any dilepton rest frame .    for @xmath41 ( in the hadronic _",
    "_ frame ) , we choose the following dilepton rest frame : @xmath42-axis along the direction of the polarized hadron , and @xmath43-axis along the direction of the polarization vector @xmath44 .",
    "to be fully specific , the 4-dimensional basis vectors are given by @xmath45 because of the specific definition of @xmath35 , this frame can actually be considered as partonic _",
    "cm _ frame .",
    "if @xmath46 , one may work in the collins - soper frame  @xcite for which the basis vectors read @xmath47 in  ( [ eq : basis_cs ] ) we use the further definitions @xmath48/ \\sqrt{s}$ ] , @xmath49/ \\sqrt{s}$ ] , with @xmath50 , @xmath51 . at tree level",
    ", @xmath5 is equal to the sum of the intrinsic transverse momenta of the two incoming partons .",
    "this implies that for @xmath46 a @xmath15-dependence is sitting in the unit vectors @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "( the @xmath15-dependence of @xmath55 is of the order @xmath56 and therefore irrelevant for our twist-3 calculation . ) as a result , the terms containing @xmath57 and @xmath58 are @xmath15-dependent .",
    "this @xmath15-dependence must be taken into account when performing the collinear expansion .    for @xmath46 , instead of using the collins - soper frame",
    ", one can alternatively perform the calculation , for instance , in the gottfried - jackson frame@xcite .",
    "keeping track of all @xmath15-dependent terms in the gottfried - jackson frame is more involved .",
    "nevertheless , we carried out the calculation , and our final result agrees with what we find in the collins - soper frame .",
    "in order to calculate @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : an ] ) one needs both the unpolarized cross section ( in the parton model ) and the spin - dependent cross section .",
    "the former is well - known and given by @xmath59 \\,.\\ ] ] the polarized cross section is a twist-3 effect and depends on quark - gluon - quark correlations , which contain interesting physics beyond the parton model .",
    "in fact , such twist-3 correlations associated with both hadrons can give rise to @xmath6 leading to the generic expression  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the transversity distribution .",
    "the second ( chiral - odd ) term in the numerator , which we have not included in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hts ] ) and  ( [ eq : bmt ] ) , was first considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our calculation",
    "we treat both the chiral - even and the chiral - odd contribution to @xmath6 .",
    "the etqs matrix element @xmath0 and its chiral - odd partner @xmath1 are defined as@xmath7 , we define light - cone coordinates according to @xmath62 and @xmath63 . ]",
    "@xmath64 where a summation over color is implicit , and gauge links has been suppressed . in the following two subsections",
    "we compute the hard coefficients associated with these matrix elements both in covariant gauge and in the light - cone gauge .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that @xmath65 and @xmath66 are related to particular @xmath15-moments of the transverse momentum dependent sivers function  @xcite and boer - mulders function  @xcite , respectively  @xcite .      in covariant gauge ,",
    "the leading contribution of the gluon field is from the component parallel to the direction of its momentum . if one considers @xmath67 ( with @xmath68 being the momentum of the polarized nucleon ) and @xmath69 as the large light - cone momenta , then the dominant component of the gluon field for the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ f:1 ] is @xmath70 . before making the collinear expansion ,",
    "the incoming partons carry a transverse momentum @xmath71 , which is much smaller than the dominant longitudinal momentum . in order to extract the twist-3 contributions from the diagrams with one - gluon - exchange",
    ", one needs to get one power of @xmath71 from the hard scattering part and combine @xmath71 with @xmath72 in order to convert the gluon field in the matrix element into the corresponding part of the field strength tensor ( @xmath73 )  @xcite . as stated above",
    ", the @xmath74-flow may go through the lepton lines via the virtual photon .",
    "therefore , we have to expand the hadronic tensor as well as the lepton tensor in terms of @xmath71 around @xmath75 .     in covariant gauge .",
    "the gluon attached to the hard scattering part is longitudinally polarized . in order to extract the twist-3 contribution",

    "[ f:1 ] contribute to @xmath6 in covariant gauge . to be more precise ,",
    "these two diagrams provide the chiral - even @xmath0 part of the asymmetry . in order to get the chiral - odd contribution one has to consider the corresponding two diagrams for which the gluon is associated with the unpolarized hadron . as an example , for the left cut - diagram in fig .",

    "frame and the collins - soper frame specified in  ( [ eq : basis_cm ] ) and in  ( [ eq : basis_cs ] ) , respectively . the azimuthal angle @xmath26 is understood in the collins - soper frame , while the azimuthal angle in the _ cm _ frame is just what we defined above as @xmath4 , namely the angle between @xmath80 and @xmath44 .",
    "there is no need to distinguish between the polar angle @xmath25 in the two frames when expanding around @xmath75 and keeping only the linear terms .",
    "for the left cut - diagram in fig .",
    "[ f:1 ] , the lepton tensor is independent of @xmath74 , but it depends on @xmath76 .",
    "the used tensor decomposition of the lepton tensor is rather convenient in order to treat this @xmath76-dependence .",
    "this dependence is sitting in three parts : the angular dependences @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the tensors @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and the hadronic tensor @xmath83 .",
    "the first term of the taylor expansion in  ( [ eq : cov_detail ] ) corresponds to the eikonal line contribution to the twist-2 quark distribution , which does not contribute to the asymmetry .",
    "one can extract the desired twist-3 term by picking up the terms linear in @xmath15 ( and @xmath76 ) from the above expansion .",
    "note that in @xmath83 also a delta function of the form @xmath84 is hidden .",
    "it is easy to see that this delta - function can not provide a term linear in @xmath76 , and therefore its @xmath76-dependence is irrelevant for the calculation of @xmath6 .",
    "this is actually the reason why the derivative term of @xmath0 , which we briefly discussed in the introduction , does not show up in @xmath6 . in general ,",
    "the collinear expansion enables one to integrate out three of the four components of the parton loop momenta , and as a result the non - perturbative part can be expressed through the collinear twist-3 correlations @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    the strong interaction phase necessary for having a nonzero ssa arises from the partonic scattering amplitude with an extra gluon . as is evident from the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ f:1 ] , this amplitude interferes with the real scattering amplitude without a gluon . the imaginary part is due to the pole of the quark ( antiquark ) propagator and arises when integrating over the longitudinal gluon momentum fraction @xmath85 . in the present case , one has a pole for @xmath86 ( `` soft gluon pole '' from initial state interaction ) , while there is no contribution from so - called hard gluon poles or soft fermion poles .",
    "we extract the imaginary part of the pole by using the formula @xmath87 collecting all the pieces we finally arrive at the following polarized differential cross section , @xmath88 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this provides the asymmetry @xmath89 which , as already stated above , is just half of the result  ( [ eq : bmt ] ) obtained in refs .  @xcite .      to test the color gauge invariance of our result , we derived the asymmetry also in the color light - cone gauge . in general , in the light - cone gauge both the first order @xmath15-expansion of the born diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ f:2 ] ) and the diagrams with one additional exchange of a transversely polarized gluon ( see fig .  [ f:3 ] ) contribute to the spin dependent cross section at the twist-3 level .",
    "the associated twist-3 non - perturbative parts are the matrix elements for which the operators @xmath90 and @xmath91 are sandwiched between the hadron state  @xcite .",
    "apparently , these two correlators are not qcd gauge invariant . however ,",
    "if one entirely fixes the light - cone gauge , i.e. , if one carries out the calculation using a specific boundary condition for the transverse gluon field at the light - cone infinity , then the two matrix elements can be uniquely related to the gauge invariant quark - gluon - quark correlators @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "-expansion in the light cone gauge .",
    "the @xmath15-flow goes also through the lepton lines via the virtual photon propagator.,width=226 ]    -0.4 cm     in the light - cone gauge .",
    "the momenta carried by all incoming partons have only a longitudinal component .",
    "the diagrams  ( c ) and  ( d ) represent the contribution from the so - called special fermion propagator introduced in ref .",
    "note that the special propagator actually contributes to the hard coefficients of both the operator @xmath90 and the operator @xmath91 .",
    "one finds that these two contributions exactly cancel each other.,width=453 ]    -0.4 cm    there exist three frequently used boundary conditions : the retarded boundary condition , the advanced boundary condition , and the anti - symmetric boundary condition . for the drell - yan process",
    "the retarded boundary condition @xmath92 is the most convenient choice  @xcite . exploiting this particular boundary condition ,",
    "the operators @xmath90 and @xmath91 can be readily rewritten in a gauge invariant form .",
    "for example , one has @xmath93 as well as @xmath94 one has to organize the contributions associated with @xmath90 and @xmath91 in a different way when using different boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "though the final result is of course independent of the boundary condition , the calculation of the hard part associated with @xmath91 in drell - yan is much more involved for both the advanced and the anti - symmetric boundary condition . for a general discussion about these issues and some more technical details",
    "we refer the interested reader to a forthcoming paper  @xcite .    for the chiral - even contribution",

    "@xmath96 contributes to the asymmetry , while the corresponding expression associated with @xmath97 vanishes due to parity conservation .",
    "this point is exactly reversed in the case of the chiral - odd part related with @xmath1 .",
    "note that the required imaginary part in the hard term coupled with the operator @xmath91 can arise from the ( artificial ) pole @xmath98 , which is generated by partial integration in eq .",

    "moreover , the diagrams with a special propagator contribute to the hard parts resulting from both the @xmath15-expansion and the gluon - exchange . however , these two contributions cancel each other .",
    "the perturbative calculation is rather straightforward .",
    "the final result for @xmath6 of the calculation in the light - cone gauge exactly matches with the final result  ( [ eq : final ] ) we found in covariant gauge .",
    "in summary , we recalculated the transverse single spin asymmetry @xmath6 in the angular distribution of a drell - yan dilepton pair by using twist-3 collinear factorization . compared to previous work on this topic , we payed particular attention to the @xmath15-dependence of the lepton tensor when making the collinear expansion .",
    "our final result for @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) differs from all the previous results given in the literature .",
    "for instance , we find an asymmetry which is just half of what was obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we made various checks in order to gain further confidence in our calculation .",
    "first , we verified qcd gauge invariance by performing the calculation both in covariant gauge and in the light - cone gauge .",
    "second , we tested the electromagnetic gauge invariance by recalculating the asymmetry in two specific qed light - cone gauges .",
    "third , we computed the nlo real emission corrections in the leading - log approximation . in a certain sense , this calculation is more straightforward than the lowest order treatment , since the @xmath15-flow can go through the unobserved parton line .",
    "the outcome of this study fully supports our result for @xmath6 presented in the present work .",
    "a complete nlo analysis will be presented elsewhere .",
    "it is important to notice that measuring the sign of @xmath6 can be considered to be equally important as checking the predicted sign reversal of the sivers effect in drell - yan  @xcite . in either case",
    "the physics of initial state gluon interactions would be tested .",
    "the formalism developed in this paper can be extended in order to study similar observables which represent a correlation between the transverse spin and the relative transverse momentum of final state particles .",
    "for instance , transverse ssas for dihadron production in semi - inclusive dis can , in principle , be treated along the same lines .",
    "we plan to address this point in a future work .",
