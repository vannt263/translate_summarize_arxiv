    "deep submillimeter - wave surveys @xcite have uncovered a population of ultra - luminous infrared ( ir ) galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xmath5l@xmath6 ) at z@xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this observationally - defined population of submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) coincides with the epoch of peak global star formation and quasar activity , with a significant contribution to the global star formation rate density at @xmath7 not traced in the uv ( @xcite , c05 ) .",
    "highly obscured by their dust content , the astrophysics of smgs and the nature of their power source remain a challenge to address at optical and near - ir wavelengths ( @xcite ; c05 ; @xcite ) .",
    "deep x - ray studies suggest that @xmath8 of smgs host an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , although at face value it appears that the agn does not dominate the bolometric luminosity and that powerful starbursts ( sb ) contribute more significantly to the total energy output ( @xcite , a05 ) .",
    "less hindered by obscuration than shorter wavelengths , the mid - ir region boasts a number of spectral features , including : emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) ( e.g. restframe 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 and 12.7@xmath2 m ) , associated with star formation @xcite and typically absent in powerful agn @xcite ; silicate absorption at 9.7 and 18@xmath2 m , which gives a measure of the obscuration by silicate dust grains along the line of sight to a small hot dust continuum source ; and a hot dust continuum ( @xmath9 m ) , likely to be dominated by an agn . the strength of these features have been used in mid - ir surveys with the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "@xcite to estimate the relative contributions of sb and agn for the brightest local galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra of the high - redshift population remained unexplored in the mid - ir , until the advent of the _ spitzer space telescope _ and the unprecedented sensitivity of the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite ( l05 ) , @xcite ( y05 ) , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have been among the pioneers in using irs to study the mid - ir spectra of luminous sources at @xmath10 , extending to higher redshifts the analysis that was previously only accessible for nearby galaxies .",
    "we have an irs program to study the range of mid - ir properties of a sample of 24 high-@xmath11 smgs with s@xmath12mjy , using the radio - identified sample with spectroscopic redshifts , compiled by c05 . here",
    "we present irs spectra of the first five targets observed ( smmj221733 + 001120 , smmj163659 + 405728 , smmj030228 + 000654 , smmj163639 + 405636 , and smmj163650 + 405735 ) : four are at lower-@xmath11 , with @xmath13 , and one is at @xmath14 .",
    "the low-@xmath11 targets cover wavelengths longwards of @xmath15 m and give insight into the longer mid - ir emission from smgs ; the full sample is more focused on @xmath16 smgs and hence probes shorter restframe wavelengths .",
    "this preliminary sample is otherwise representative of the smg population , in terms of bolometric luminosity , dust temperature and submillimeter - to - radio flux ratio ( c05 ) .",
    "[ spectra ]",
    "we observed each target using the low resolution long - low ( ll ) observing mode of irs ( @xmath17 ) at two different nod positions for 30 cycles of 120s each .",
    "we cover restframe emission longwards of 6@xmath2 m to probe for pah emission at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.3@xmath2 m and for silicate absorption centered at 9.7@xmath2 m .",
    "the data were obtained between december 2005 and march 2006 .",
    "the data were processed using the spitzer irs s13 pipeline , which includes saturation flagging , dark subtraction , linearity correction , ramp correction and flat - fielding . with a slit size of @xmath18 , irs does not resolve the smgs spatially , and the targets were treated as point sources throughout the data reduction and analysis .",
    "we performed additional reduction of the 2d spectra using irsclean to remove rogue pixels , and relied on differencing between the nod positions to subtract the residual background .",
    "we used the spitzer irs custom extraction ( spice ) software to optimally extract flux - calibrated 1d spectra , by taking a weighted average of profile - normalized flux at each wavelength to increase the s / n of these faint sources .",
    "the mid - ir spectra of smmj221733 , smmj163659 , smmj030228 and smmj163639 show moderate to strong pah features ( see fig.1 ) , and we refer to these targets collectively as the _ pah sample_. detection of pah emission is assumed to indicate the presence of sb activity . at most a very shallow dip is present around 9.7@xmath2 m in the spectra , indicating little silicate absorption .",
    "our highest-@xmath11 source , smmj163650 , is somewhat different to the other targets , with a broad feature at restframe @xmath48@xmath2 m , unlike the typical blended pah complex of the 7.7- and 8.6-@xmath2 m features found in sb galaxies .",
    "it is more reminiscent of the spectrum of mrk231 ( @xcite , a06b ) , which features an unabsorbed continuum between absorption from silicates at longer wavelengths and hydrocarbons at shorter ones ( @xcite , s04 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this similarity suggests that smmj163650 has more substantial agn - activity than the smgs in the pah sample , as expected from the presence of a strong civ ( @xmath19 ) feature at restframe uv ( c05 ) and a broad h@xmath20 component ( @xmath21 km s@xmath22 ; @xcite ) , both revealing the unambiguous presence of an agn .",
    "we discuss the properties of this source in more detail in a subsequent paper discussing the full sample ( menndez - delmestre et al . in prep . ) and concentrate here on the median properties of the smgs with clear pah emission .",
    "to get an insight into the physics inherent to smgs in our pah sample , we compare their spectra with extensively studied local templates : the agns mrk231 ( a06b ) and ngc1068 @xcite , the sb m82 @xcite and the ulirgs arp220 ( a06b ) and ngc6240 ( @xcite , a06a ) .",
    "arp220 has been a favorite template for high - redshift smgs ( @xcite ) : it has strong pah features , indicative of sb activity , and a steep mid - ir continuum due to a heavily obscured nuclear component inferred to be responsible for the bulk of the ir luminosity ( s04 ) .",
    "agns have been identified in both merging components of ngc6240 but sb dominates the total ir luminosity @xcite .    a qualitative comparison of the spectra of our pah sample with these templates rules out mrk231 , ngc1068 and arp220 as good matches , but the spectra are similar to those of m82 and ngc6240 .",
    "similar results were found by l05 , who detected strong pah features in the spectra of two luminous smgs at @xmath23 that were well fitted by an m82-type spectrum .",
    "[ ratios ]      we take advantage of the similarity between the spectra in the pah sample and of our precisely known redshifts ( c05 ) to double our s / n constructing a composite spectrum by averaging the individual spectra ( fig.1 ) .",
    "we use the composite spectrum to make a preliminary assessment of the independent contributions of sb and agn activity in our pah sample .",
    "normalizing the local templates to the 7.7-@xmath2 m peak in the composite spectrum , we find that the composite spectrum is well fitted at @xmath24 m by the ngc6240 and m82 spectra ( fig.1 ) .",
    "however , neither template provides a good fit to the composite spectrum at @xmath25 m : the continuum emission of ngc6240 exceeds that of the composite spectrum at @xmath26 m , while the spectrum of m82 falls below it .",
    "no physically reasonable additional agn component can be added to the ngc6240 spectrum to produce a good fit to the composite spectrum at longer wavelengths . on the other hand , an m82-type spectrum plus",
    "a power - law continuum provides a good fit to the composite smg data at all wavelengths .",
    "the 7.7-@xmath2 m pah feature is generally the most prominent in the mid - ir spectra of sb galaxies .",
    "its strength relative to the continuum , measured by the equivalent width ( ew ) , can be used to evaluate the fractional sb contribution to the total bolometric output , as the hot mid - ir continuum is enhanced significantly in the presence of an agn .",
    "sb - dominated objects , such as m82 and ngc6240 , are characterized by larger pah ews than objects with a prominent agn , such as mrk231 .",
    "ews are sensitive to how the continuum is defined .",
    "we define a linear continuum by interpolating between two points clear of pah emission , at 6.8@xmath2 m and 13.7@xmath2 m , or at 9@xmath2 m when the spectrum does not include one of these points . in fig.2",
    "we plot the 7.7-@xmath2 m restframe ews and pah - to - ir luminosity ratios for the smgs in the pah sample with 7.7-@xmath2 m coverage and for the composite spectrum .",
    "the error in @xmath27/@xmath28 for our smg sample is dominated by a @xmath29 uncertainty in the ir luminosities ( c05 ) values , which rely on this relation , are in average overestimated by a factor of @xmath30 . ] .",
    "we compare a number of low- and high-@xmath11 sources , including 2 ulirgs at @xmath16 with clear pah detections from the y05 sample with s@xmath31 mjy , and 2 smgs ( smmj02399@xmath320136 with s@xmath3323mjy and mmj154127 + 6616 with s@xmath3314.6mjy ) at @xmath34 ( l05 ) .    according to the line - to - continuum ( l / c ) diagnostic presented by @xcite , systems with ( l / c)@xmath35@xmath36 1 are classified as sb@xmath32dominated and those with ( l / c)@xmath35@xmath37 1 , as agn - dominated . with ( l / c)@xmath38@xmath36 1 ,",
    "sbs appear to dominate the y05 , l05 and our pah sample corresponds to @xmath39 m ] .",
    "however , the distribution in 7.7-@xmath2 m ew and pah - to - ir luminosity ratio in fig.2 may suggest a distinction in the relative sb - to - agn contributions , with lower values of these parameters indicating a stronger agn contribution .",
    "we distinguish three regions in fig.2 : ( 1 ) a region with low pah - to - ir luminosity ratios , occupied by mrk1014 @xcite and the 24@xmath2m - bright sample of y05 ; ( 2 ) an intermediate pah - to - ir luminosity region where ngc6240 and the bulk of the smgs in our sample are located ; and ( 3 ) a region with the highest pah - to - ir luminosity ratios , occupied by m82 and the two smgs in l05 .    at @xmath40 ,",
    "24-@xmath2 m flux traces 8-@xmath2 m restframe continuum ; a stronger hot mid - ir continuum ( produced by an agn ) dilutes the strength of pah features , leading to lower @xmath41 .",
    "the location of the y05 sample in the plot could follow from the selection of 24@xmath2m - bright targets ( s@xmath42 0.9 mjy ) at this redshift , which would select objects with lower sb - to - agn ratios .",
    "smgs in our sample have higher @xmath41 ratios , similar to ngc6240 , which we interpret as an indication of a markedly stronger sb contribution to the total luminosity than the y05 sample . with similar ir - luminosities , the location of the l05 smg pair in this plot indicates that the 7.7-@xmath2 m pah feature is very strong . with large values for both the ew and the pah - to - ir luminosity ratio ,",
    "mmj154127 has been suggested to be dominated by sb - activity ( l05 ) .",
    "the large pah - to - ir luminosity ratio for smmj02399 suggests strong sb - activity ; however , the relatively low ew value , together with the evident strong mid - ir continuum ( see fig.1 , l05 ) is consistent with this source having roughly equal agn and sb contributions .",
    "the smgs in our pah sample have values of ew@xmath38 and @xmath41 that place their sb - to - agn ratio between that of the agn - dominated ulirg mrk1014 and the sb m82 .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to ngc6240 , which has both sb and agn components . as a caveat , we note that even though the 7.7-@xmath2 m pah - to - ir luminosity ratio is associated to the sb - to - agn ratio , it is also sensitive to details of the spectral energy distribution of the system , such as the presence of multiple dust components at different temperatures and the amount of extinction ( e.g. arp220 ; s04 ) .",
    "this may explain the particularly high 7.7-@xmath2 m pah - to - ir luminosity ratio for smmj02399 .",
    "mid - ir line diagnostics suggest that smgs are sb - like .",
    "the spectra of the sb - dominated galaxies m82 and ngc6240 provide a good fit to the composite spectrum at @xmath24 m ; however , only an m82-type spectrum with an additional power law agn component gives a good fit to the composite spectrum at all wavelengths .",
    "the power - law component is defined as @xmath43 , consistent with the range of ir spectral indices for 3c quasars in @xcite .    from the power - law component flux at",
    "10.5@xmath2 m we estimate the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath44 ) using the correlation between @xmath45 and @xmath46 presented by @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath47erg s@xmath22 for an agn at the average redshift for the smgs presented in this paper , z @xmath4 1.4 , in reasonable agreement with the x - ray luminosities found for the smgs in a05 . following a05 s approach",
    ", we compare the average x - ray - to - far - ir ratio of the smgs in the pah sample with the typical ratio for quasars and find that the residual flux is consistent with an underlying agn contributing in the order @xmath410@xmath48 to the total far - ir emission .",
    "this agrees with the a05 result that agn activity is often present in smgs but does not dominate the energetics . since the 10.5-@xmath2 m excess is dominated by lower redshift sources , further smgs at @xmath49 , included in menndez - delmestre et al .",
    "( in prep ) , will better constrain this excess .",
    "we present first results of a _",
    "spitzer _ program to characterize the mid - ir spectra of high redshift smgs .",
    "we compare the spectra to well - studied local templates and find that smgs have starburst mid - ir spectra more like m82 than the often quoted local analog arp220 .",
    "the composite spectrum of the smgs in the pah sample is well fitted by an m82-like starburst - component with a power - law continuum most likely representing a fainter underlying agn .",
    "this similarity to the m82 spectrum suggests that the chemistry of the interstellar medium and radiation fields in these systems may be understood by looking at local galaxies in detail .",
    "analysis of the 7.7-@xmath2 m equivalent widths and pah - to - ir luminosity ratios show that smgs are markedly different from 24@xmath2m - selected samples , such as the @xmath40 sample of y05 , which show stronger agn contributions .",
    "this work provides further evidence that smgs host both star - formation and agn activity , but that star - formation dominates the bolometric luminosity , reiterating the role of smgs as the build - up sites for a significant fraction of the stellar content we see today .    by probing the lower - redshift end of the c05 smg sample distribution ,",
    "this sample provides rest - frame wavelength coverage longwards of @xmath50 m to assess the agn contribution .",
    "the smg at @xmath3 , with a redshift closer to that of a typical c05 smg , displays a potentially more agn - dominated mrk231-type broad feature at restframe @xmath48@xmath2 m .",
    "the difference in agn contributions within our preliminary sample suggests an increasing relative agn - activity in smgs at higher redshifts , potentially due to the @xmath51 flux limit applied to the sample . the full sample , with a more extended redshift distribution , will provide us with additional valuable information concerning the typical smg population",
