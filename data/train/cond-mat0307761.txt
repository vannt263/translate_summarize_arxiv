    "promoted by the synthesis of various one - dimensional ( 1d ) bimetallic molecular magnets , the physics of quantum spin chains with mixed magnetic moments is of great interest .",
    "typically , quasi-1d mixed - spin ( ms ) compounds display _ antiferromagnetic _ ( afm ) intra - chain exchange @xcite , which has stimulated theoretical investigations of afm ms models using a variety of techniques such as spin - wave theory @xcite , variational methods @xcite , the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite , and quantum monte carlo calculations@xcite .",
    "interestingly , since a unit cell of the ms chain comprises of two different magnetic moments , the spectrum will allow for excitation of ` acoustic ' as well as ` optical ' nature @xcite . while not identified unambiguously in present day experiments , the character of these excitations should appear in thermodynamic and other observable properties as two _ independent energy scales_. @xcite    in addition , and apart from the preceding , what remains less well studied are ms chains with _",
    "( fm ) intra - chain exchange , which arise in materials of recent interest such as mnni(no@xmath0)@xmath1(en)@xmath0 with en = ethylenediamine @xcite .",
    "this compound is regarded as a quasi-1d ms material with spins @xmath2 and @xmath3 at the mn and ni ions , respectively .",
    "the susceptibility displays an easy - axis anisotropy . at temperatures below @xmath4",
    ", a weak afm inter - chain coupling induces afm ordering .",
    "if this antiferromagnetic order is suppressed by a magnetic field of approximately 1.6 t , the low - temperature specific heat shows a maximum at @xmath5 and a shoulder at @xmath6 .",
    "these features could possibly reflect the two aforementioned characteristic energy scales , however for the case of an fm , rather than an afm ms chain .",
    "motivated by this , it is the purpose of this paper to perform a complementary analysis of the thermodynamic properties of fm ms chains , using high - temperature series expansion ( htse ) , exact diagonalization ( ed ) , and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) . in particular",
    ", our htse will be derived for _ arbitrary _ alternating spins @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this will allow not only for a direct comparison with experimental data , but also for a study of a gradual transit to the ` half - classical ' limit @xmath9 which is exactly solvable @xcite . finally ,",
    "while our ed and qmc data will be obtained on systems of the smallest possible mixed - spin magnitude , i.e. @xmath10 and @xmath11 , this is a case also included in the htse . in addition , for the sake of completeness and to compare with existing literature , we will also include results for the afm case .    in this paper , we focus on a chain with two kinds of spin species , i.e. @xmath7 and @xmath8 , arranged alternatingly and coupled by a nearest - neighbor heisenberg exchange .",
    "namely , the hamiltonian reads @xmath12 the subscript @xmath13 refers to the unit cells , and we always use periodic boundary conditions .    in section [ sec : htse ] , our htse approach is detailed . in section [ sec : classed ] , we turn to a comparison with qmc and ed and the results of the ` half - classical ' limit . in section [ sec",
    ": fit ] , we discuss the result of fitting the htse to susceptibility data obtained for mnni(no@xmath0)@xmath1(en)@xmath0 .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the htse is an expansion in powers of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the inverse temperature .",
    "here we use the linked - cluster expansion of ref .  .",
    "in this method , the series coefficients for the thermodynamic limit are obtained _ exactly _ from those calculated on finite - size clusters . in general , this includes the subtraction of contributions from a large number of so - called subclusters . in one dimension , however , significant simplifications occur due to cancellation @xcite .",
    "this is true also for the ms chain systems .",
    "that is , in the absence of a magnetic field , the free energy @xmath16 in the thermodynamic limit is represented by @xmath17,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the free energy of the @xmath19-site open - chain system described by @xmath20 and @xmath21 is obtained by exchanging @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xmath18 .",
    "then , a calculation of @xmath22 $ ] is needed on a finite system , i.e.,@xmath23 where @xmath24 represents the magnetic quantum numbers at site @xmath25 .",
    "we apply @xmath26 order by order on the ket @xmath27 .",
    "this operation yields linear combinations of kets with coefficients which are functions of @xmath28 . to evaluate @xmath29 ,",
    "products of kets of type @xmath30 are needed at most , while in the case of tr@xmath31 , one can use that @xmath32 . in order to evaluate this trace , we use two different algorithms",
    ".    method ( i ) is based on a direct matrix multiplication for fixed @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "a linear combination of kets with coefficients is regarded as a sparse vector .",
    "it is stored as a compressed array of non - zero elements and another array of their pointers to the kets .",
    "these pointers are stored in the ascending order so that one can find a needed element using binary search in the array .",
    "all the operations are performed using integers , and thus there is no loss of precision .    method ( ii ) is designed for arbitrary spins , which is based on an analytic approach to the matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w1 ] ) .",
    "it has an advantage for large spins because the method ( i ) will fail for very large spins due to time and/or memory constraints .",
    "after symbolic operations , the summation of the form @xmath33 can be calculated analytically for arbitrary @xmath34 .",
    "for example , when @xmath35 , the sum is equal to @xmath36 . as a result ,",
    "the series coefficients are obtained as an expression valid for arbitrary @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "naively it may seem that operators of type @xmath37 will causes square roots in the matrix elements of the hamiltonian .",
    "however , such square roots are absent in the final result . in fact , the calculation can be carried out disregarding square roots as explained below . introducing the simplified notation , @xmath38 the initial state",
    "is represented by @xmath39 .",
    "spin operators act on these states as follows .",
    "( @xmath34>0 ) represents the state at site @xmath25 in the notation ( [ eq : newket ] ) .",
    "then,@xmath41 and@xmath42 note that the norm of @xmath43 is not unity , namely , @xmath44    besides the methods ( i ) and ( ii ) , the contribution to the specific heat from the largest cluster is calculated separately .",
    "namely , contributions from @xmath45-site chain to @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath47 $ ] have a simple form ; with notation @xmath48 and @xmath49 , for @xmath50 it is proportional to 2@xmath51 @xmath52 and for @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "the prefactors of these terms can be determined by comparing with those of @xmath55 for any @xmath45 in ref .  .",
    "the methods ( i ) and ( ii ) are used only for the rest of the contribution .",
    "we have computed the specific heat for the model ( [ hint ] ) with @xmath11 and @xmath10 , up to 29th order using the method ( i ) .",
    "furthermore , for arbitrary @xmath8 and @xmath7 , the series has been calculated up to 11th order using the method ( ii ) and standard symbolic packages @xcite . by setting @xmath56 ,",
    "our model is reduced to the homogeneous spin - half heisenberg chain , and our series agrees with that in the literature@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have also checked that the @xmath9 limit of the series agrees with the taylor series of the exact solution@xcite which will be shown in the next section .",
    "in this section , we provide evidence for the presence of a double - peak - like structure in the specific heat of the fm ms chain .",
    "we begin by recalling the elementary excitations in an ms chain .",
    "the dispersion relation of the one - magnon excitations in the fm case reads @xmath57 and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] for the extreme quantum case , @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "similar to the afm case@xcite , the spectrum consists of both an acoustic and an optical branch reflecting the presence of two different spins in a unit cell .",
    "these branches indicate two energy scales in the thermodynamics of the ms chains .",
    "the appearance of two one - magnon branches can be qualitatively understood as follows : at @xmath58 , the excitations correspond to an alternating tilting of either the shorter or the longer spins as indicated by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] .",
    "the magnitude of neighboring spins determines the energies of these modes , leading to a splitting of the branches for @xmath59 . as @xmath60",
    "is reduced away from @xmath58 , the magnon eigenstates gradually loose these alternating tilting form , and near @xmath61 become similar in nature to those of uniform chains .",
    "the low - temperature specific heat as computed using linear spin - wave theory is expected to be exact@xcite to leading order in @xmath62 . since @xmath63 is proportional to @xmath64 at low energies ,",
    "the specific heat is thus proportional to @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "we can establish a connection between the high - temperature series for the specific heat and this low - temperature scaling using a suitable pad analysis . in extrapolating the high - temperature series for the specific heat , information from the ground - state energy ,",
    "the low - energy excitations , and the high - temperature entropy can be used as follows @xcite : the expansion variable is changed from @xmath15 to the internal energy per unit cell , @xmath67 . here ,",
    "@xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "the power series of @xmath70 is thus inverted to obtain @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath72 denote the entropy per unit cell of the ms chain . from @xmath73 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "the low - temperature behavior of the specific heat , @xmath76 , translates into @xmath77 at @xmath78 for the new series , where @xmath79 is the ground state energy per site . in ref .",
    ", only the fm @xmath80 is used to extrapolate the specific heat of a htse for a fm model . here",
    ", we also employ the afm @xmath80 , since this additional constraint from the other sign of @xmath81 does not drastically change the final result , but makes the extrapolation less sensitive to the used pad approximant .",
    "we thus obtain the same extrapolation for both the fm and the afm case .",
    "namely , the afm specific heat will be obtained using the substitutions @xmath82 and @xmath83 from the fm case .",
    "then , if the pad approximant in @xmath84 is applied to @xmath85 the low - temperature behavior and the high - temperature entropy are correctly reproduced . for @xmath11 and @xmath10",
    ", we use the afm ground - state energy @xmath86 from ref .  .",
    "the extrapolation is found to be rather insensitive to errors in @xmath87 .",
    "for example , an error @xmath88 in @xmath87 affects the afm specific heat only by @xmath89 at @xmath90 , and even less at higher temperatures . in the following we denote by @xmath91 $ ] the rational approximant function in @xmath84 resulting from a polynomial of order @xmath92 over a polynomial of order @xmath34 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pade ] , a comparison is shown between different pad approximants for the low - temperature specific heat for the @xmath11 , @xmath10 case .",
    "we also include results from stochastic series expansion qmc simulations @xcite for both the fm and the afm case for chains of 100 sites .",
    "no deviations were found to the qmc data for 50 sites , and thus we regard these results to represent the thermodynamic limit . for the afm case , the dmrg results from ref .",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pade]a as well .",
    "in contrast to the afm case , the htse result for the low - temperature specific heat for the fm case shows large oscillation upon increasing the order of the series .",
    "comparison with the qmc data shows that the exact solution is located within the range of these oscillations .",
    "we take the arithmetic average of @xmath93 $ ] , @xmath94 $ ] , @xmath95 $ ] and @xmath96 $ ] as the final htse result , which in the temperature range @xmath97 has an error of order 5% . the specific heat in a larger temperature regime",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : edhine ] .",
    "we find overall good agreement between the qmc and the htse data , both for the afm and the fm case .",
    "in contrast to the homogeneous fm spin-1/2 chain , the fm ms chain displays at least two distinct structures in @xmath98 , namely a peak at @xmath99 and a shoulder at @xmath100 .",
    "the htse result indicates the presence of an additional weak shoulder at @xmath101 , which is however difficult to check for using qmc due to increasing statistical errors at that low temperatures .",
    "the features in the intermediate temperature regime become more pronounced with increasing order of the series expansion , probably because the higher - order polynomials can reproduce the involved rapid changes more accurately .",
    "we have included in fig .",
    "[ fig : edhine ] ed results for small finite chains for both the afm and the fm case .",
    "the full spectrum has been calculated for finite chains with up to 7 unit - cells ( 14 sites ) .",
    "the ed result for 14 sites agrees with the qmc and the htse down to temperatures of @xmath102 for the fm case , and @xmath103 for the afm case .",
    "[ fig : edhine ] clearly shows that finite - size effects in the specific heat are significantly larger in the fm than in the afm case . in the afm case ,",
    "the differences between the 12- and 14-site data are already rather small , with a weak shoulder at low temperature signaling the second energy scale in @xmath104 . for the fm case",
    "the ed data show a strong finite - size shift of the specific heat maximum , which gradually develops into the shoulder near @xmath100 , which is found both from the htse and qmc .",
    "this suggests that long - range collective modes dominate the thermodynamics up to higher temperatures for the fm than for the afm case . to shed more light onto this difference ,",
    "let us compare the elementary excitation spectra for the fm and the afm case : ( i ) at low temperatures , the specific heat reflects the dispersion of the acoustic branch of excitations . in the long - wavelength limit ,",
    "the dispersion in linear spin - wave theory reads@xmath105 where the plus ( minus ) sign represents the fm ( afm@xcite ) case .",
    "therefore , the slope of the acoustic branch in the afm case is larger than in the fm case , making low - temperature shoulders more pronounced for fm ms chains .",
    "( ii ) the gap between the acoustic and the optical mode in the fm case is larger than in the afm@xcite case , so that the splitting of the structures in @xmath98 is more evident in the former case . apart from ( i ) and ( ii )",
    ", the elementary excitation spectra of the fm and the afm case resemble each other , pointing towards additional effects from magnon interactions .    after analyzing the extreme quantum case with @xmath11 and @xmath10",
    ", we now discuss the specific heat of ms chains for larger values of @xmath7 , keeping @xmath11 fixed . in particular , we want to connect to the exactly solvable @xcite ` half - classical ' limit , @xmath9 .    fig .",
    "[ fig : sinf ] shows the results from the 11th order htse for @xmath11 and various values of @xmath7 .",
    "the temperature is normalized to @xmath106 in order to render the half - classical limit finite . in the limit",
    "@xmath9 the specific heat of the chain with fm couplings is identical to that of the afm chain , with a distinct peak at @xmath107 . at @xmath108",
    "the specific heat of the ` half - classical ' model is finite . in the quantum case , however , the specific heat vanishes as @xmath109 . using the variable @xmath7 htse",
    ", we can link both limiting situations as follows : in the limit @xmath9 , the series coefficients of @xmath110 with odd @xmath34 converge to zero .",
    "let us compare the @xmath111-th and @xmath112-th order terms at finite @xmath7 .",
    "the ratio of the latter to the former is of @xmath113 , where @xmath114 .",
    "hence , if the limit @xmath9 is taken with @xmath115 fixed , the latter becomes negligible compared to the former as @xmath9 .",
    "however , if @xmath7 is finite , the two terms are comparable for temperatures below @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , even if @xmath7 is large , the specific heat deviates from the half - classical behavior below @xmath116 , and approaches zero as @xmath117 . as a result",
    ", the specific heat will display a double - peak - like structure for large @xmath7 as well . summarizing these results from the htse , there are two different ways of taking the large-@xmath7 and @xmath109 limit , @xmath118    as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : sinf ] the difference between the fm and the afm cases are most pronounced in the extreme quantum limit @xmath11 and @xmath10 , and in the low - temperature regime .",
    "the large- and small - spin limits exhibit similar structures , suggesting that the specific heat of ms chain systems in general show a double - peak - like or peak - shoulder structure , both for afm and fm intra - chain exchange , and for any combination of spins . in the fm case",
    "this structure is more pronounced if @xmath119 is large , reflecting the size of the gap between the acoustic and the optical mode , similar to the afm case.@xcite    we note that the specific heat in the high - temperature limit of the afm case is larger than in the fm case because of quantum effects .",
    "this is evident from the first two terms of the series for the specific heat , which we present in appendix [ sec : seriesdata ] .",
    "these two terms stem from two - site correlations only and dominate the high - temperature behavior . since the total entropy difference between zero and infinite temperature is the same in both cases , the fm and afm specific - heat curves therefore have to intersect at low temperatures .",
    "we now turn to a comparison to the susceptibility data observed on mnni(no@xmath0)@xmath1(en)@xmath0 . in this compound ,",
    "the symmetry around ni ions is nearly cubic with however a fairly large anisotropy at the mn site to be expected @xcite .",
    "hence , we take into account a single - site anisotropy only on one of the spins , i.e. @xmath7 . the _",
    "g_-factors of the spins @xmath7 and @xmath8 are represented by @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively .",

    "since the contribution @xmath129 is used to evaluate the susceptibility we will only consider the case of small zeeman energies @xmath130 in the following . the orientation of the magnetic field @xmath131 will be chosen to be either @xmath132 or @xmath133 .",
    "most theoretical studies of ms systems are limited to the case of @xmath127 and @xmath128 , in order to make use of total spin-@xmath134 , i.e. @xmath135 , conservation .",

    "since 3d afm ordering of mnni(no@xmath0)@xmath1(en)@xmath0 below @xmath139 signals the presence of a non - negligible inter - chain exchange , we will enhance our 1d analysis to incorporate this coupling on a phenomenological basis .",
    "that is to say , fits to the experimental results will be performed using an rpa expression @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the susceptibility of the pure 1d system obtained by htse and extrapolated by a simple pad approximation ( pa ) . here",

    "the low - temperature specific heat of mnni(no@xmath0)@xmath1(en)@xmath0 shows a weak shoulder around 1.5k if magnetic order is suppressed by a finite magnetic field .",
    "it is thus suggestive to associate this shoulder with the presence of ` acoustic ' excitations in this compound .",
    "however , a quantitatively accurate description of the relevant temperature range for the fm mixed - spin chain with @xmath3 and @xmath2 in a magnetic field requires further numerical studies and is left for future investigations . finally , comparing the afm with the fm case in the extreme quantum limit ,",

    "<S> using a combination of high - temperature series expansion , exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo , we perform a complementary analysis of the thermodynamic properties of quasi - one - dimensional mixed - spin systems with alternating magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to explicit series expansions for small spin quantum numbers , we present an expansion that allows a direct evaluation of the series coefficients as a function of spin quantum numbers . due to the presence of excitations of both acoustic and optical nature , the specific heat of a mixed - spin chain displays a double - peak - like structure , which is more pronounced for ferromagnetic than for antiferromagnetic intra - chain exchange . </S>",
    "<S> we link these results to an analytically solvable half - classical limit . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we extend our series expansion to incorporate the single - ion anisotropies relevant for the molecular mixed - spin ferromagnetic chain material mnni(no@xmath0)@xmath1(ethylenediamine)@xmath0 , with alternating spins of magnitude 5/2 and 1 . including a weak inter - chain coupling , we show that the observed susceptibility allows for an excellent fit , and the extraction of microscopic exchange parameters . </S>"
