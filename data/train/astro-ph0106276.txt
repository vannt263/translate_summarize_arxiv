    "one of the principles on which standard cosmological models are based is homogeneity of distribution of matter on large scales ( peebles , 1983 ) . a direct indication of such a character of distribution of matter in the observed universe is , for instance , the homogeneity and anisotropy of cmb radiation .",
    "at the same time , the investigators of the large - scale structure have discovered inhomogeneities in the distribution of visible matter on scales to 100mpc ( iau symp . , 1978 ; geller & huchra , 1989 ) . within the frames of the present - day knowledge",
    "there are two main large - scale structure models : a homogeneous model with fluctuations of density of finite amplitudes and a fractal model characterized by self - similarity of structures of the observed universe in a certain interval of scales .",
    "a question on scales of extension of fractal structures is being debated .",
    "according to davis ( 1997 ) , the self - similarity properties of distribution of galaxies manifest themselves but to 10mpc .",
    "pietronero et al .",
    "( 1997 ) advocated the idea that a maximum scale of clustering can not be reached by the present - day surveys of galaxies and clusters of galaxies , the fractal properties in the distribution of matter are observed to @xmath2mpc and there are signs of extension of the fractal structure to @xmath3mpc .",
    "there are several key stages in the history of origin and development of knowledge of fractal ( self - similar ) type of distribution of matter .",
    "having noticed the sequence of clustering ( galaxies , groups , clusters , superclusters ) , de vaucouleurs ( 1970 ) provided an observational substantiation of the model of hierarchical clustering which could explain the power , with a slope @xmath4 , decreasing of density with increasing radius ( de vaucouleurs diagram ) . by 1982 mandelbrot ( 1977 , 1982 ) had extended these ideas and introduced a mathematically rigorous notion of fractals and proposed , following from general considerations , a fractal dimension @xmath5 for the universe .    about 20-year work over the redshift surveys , increasingly deeper and",
    "complete , made it possible to see in the distribution of galaxies the structures and voids of different shape ( huchra et al .",
    ", 1983 ) , the filling of the volume by objects with measured @xmath6 still more clearly defined the features noticed previously ( fairall , 1998 ) .",
    "the maps of the distribution of galaxies in space of redshifts ( cfa1 survey ( huchra et al . , 1983 ) ,",
    "the first deep two - dimensional ( slice ) cfa2 survey ( geller & huchra , 1989 ) and others ) were consistent with intuitive ideas of stochastic fractal point distributions in three - dimensional space : extended `` coherent regions '' of increased density , voids occupying a considerable part of the volume , general `` clumpy '' and irregular pattern of distribution .    the more detailed construction of the three - dimensional pattern of the nearest regions of the universe gave impetus to development of a variety of statistical methods ( borgani , 1995 ; el - ad et al . , 1996 ; paladin & vulpiani , 1987 ; plionis & valdarnini , 1992 ) of isolation and study of different structures in the distribution of objects in the universe ( such as voids , filaments , superclusters , `` walls '' ) .",
    "as distinct from the two - point correlation function , these methods reveal more finely characteristic morphological properties of the structures",
    ". the methods of search for fractal ( scale - invariant ) properties of matter distribution were executed mathematically ( borgani , 1995 ; pietronero , 1987 ; coleman & pietronero , 1992 ) .",
    "if the mean density in the volume under study is not determined , i.e. it varies considerably with increasing working volume up to scales characterizing the volume under study , the standard statistical method of analysis of the large - scale structure , the two - point correlation function ( @xmath7-function ) ( peebles , 1983 ; davis & peebles , 1983 ; boerner & mo , 1990 ; klypin & kopylov , 1983 ; dalton et al . ,",
    "1992 ) will then yield a result dependent on the parameters of the sample and the way of calculation .",
    "for instance , it has been noted that the `` correlation scale '' @xmath8 grows with increasing volume of the sample ( einasto et al . , 1986 ; coleman & pietronero , 1992 ) .",
    "pietronero et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and coleman & pietronero ( 1992 ) noticed that if the given sample does not include the scales where the amplitude of clustering is small , i.e. the distribution is homogeneous ( the scatter of the number of galaxies in distant equal volumes is described by the poissonian statistics ) , then the parameters of the @xmath7-function do not show the real amplitude and the limiting scale of clustering , and proposed another method of calculation of the correlation function of density , the so - called gamma - function ( hereafter gamma ) or the `` conditional density '' ( coleman & pietronero , 1992 ) used in statistical physics for analysis of non - analytical structures with large - scale density correlations .",
    "pietronero and his co - workers ( pietronero et al . , 1997",
    "; sylos labini et al . , 1996 , 1997 ;",
    "montuori et al .",
    ", 1997 ; sylos labini et al . , 1998 )",
    "had been using this method for over 10 years to study the distribution of astrophysical objects and concluded that fractal structures are extended to scales 100150@xmath9mpc , and from indirect data ( relation between `` radial '' density and distance from esp survey ) even to @xmath10mpc ( pietronero et al . ,",
    "1997 ) .    the papers of pietronero and his colleagues found a broad response .",
    "cosmological models were proposed which took account of the fractality ( baryshev , 1981 ; baryshev et al . ,",
    "1994 ) as an essential part of the universe picture ( interpretation of redshift as a gravitation effect which is determined by the global inhomogeneity of the universe but not by the expansion of space ) .",
    "controversy developed as to the scales of extension of the fractal structure ( davis , 1997 ; pietronero et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "nevertheless , among the researchers of the large - scale structure only pietronero s group keeps holding `` radical '' viewpoints of the enormous extension ( up to 1000mpc ) of the fractal law of density variation with distance , which is described by the single dimension @xmath11 ( mandelbrot , 1977 ; feder , 1988 ) .",
    "the fractal methods are difficult to apply to the study of distribution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies because the existing samples represent the distribution of a finite number of points in a finite volume , whereas the fractal properties in terms of mathematics are determined at the limit of infinity . for the `` physical '' or `` dynamical '' fractal",
    "a large ( but finite ) interval of scales between the lower and upper limits of manifestation of self - similarity properties is necessary ( mccauley , 1997 ) .",
    "the condition `` volume limited '' should be met in order that all regions of the sample be represented with equal rights , that is , from every object one could `` see '' any other . for samples of galaxies",
    "this condition is realized when the objects , whose absolute stellar magnitude is larger than that of the faintest galaxies at the far limit of the sample , are rejected .",
    "it is important to note that the ideology of construction of the gamma calls for abandoning a priori assumptions concerning the properties of the distribution of the sample objects .",
    "thus for the method to be used , careful preliminary work is required on the creation of a sample of homogeneously selected objects with sharply defined spatial boundaries .",
    "the scales to which the gamma can be calculated are restricted by the radius of a maximum sphere with the centre in the object of the sample , which can still fall within the boundaries of the sample .",
    "the gamma is variation of the mean density of objects as the volume under study increases .",
    "the differential and integral gamma - functions are determined as follows : @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the numerical density .",
    "the integral function ( @xmath15 ) averages the contribution of different scales and therefore , with the presence of properties of a monofractal in the distribution , it smoothes fluctuations and allows the dimension of the distribution to be measured with a higher accuracy than the differential function .",
    "at the same time the integral function is not very sensitive to change of the type of distribution .",
    "the differential function , in principle , registers better change of the mode of distribution than the integral function does , and in this sense it is more informative , but at the same time it is more susceptible to fluctuations .    in some cases",
    "the form of the gamma has a simple interpretation . for the monofractal with the single dimension @xmath11 ( `` filling of the volume '' occurs , on the average , in the same manner on all scales for all objects ) the relationship between the number of objects in a sphere and its radius , @xmath16 , is satisfied . in the general case @xmath17 . for a homogeneous distribution",
    "the number of points in the volume is directly proportional to the volume ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the average density in a sphere of radius @xmath19 placed in a given fractal structure or , for instance , in a  uniform  distribution   is @xmath20 . at @xmath21",
    "the average density @xmath22 is a diminishing function of radius @xmath19 and @xmath23 at @xmath24 is satisfied for each point regarded as the centre of the sphere of radius @xmath19 . for the homogeneous distribution ( @xmath18 )",
    "the average density is constant and independent of the volume it is measured in .    in the case of a `` pure '' monofractal structure",
    ", @xmath15 must change according to a power law with the slope of the straight line in the plot @xmath25 , which is defined by the fractal dimension of the set .",
    "if the fractal properties manifest themselves only to a certain scale @xmath26 with transition to uniformity on larger scales , the relations : @xmath27 @xmath28 are satisfied .",
    "the gamma function is represented here by definition in the form @xmath29 and @xmath16 .    when analysing the real distribution , it should be borne in mind that even if the points of the integral gamma fall well on a straight line in the region of drop of the `` conditional density '' , it does not suggest that the properties of the monofractal are present in the distribution .",
    "analysis of artificial distributions shows that the power law gamma diminishing with the index @xmath30 is a necessary , but not a sufficient condition for fractality of the distribution with the dimension @xmath31 .",
    "nevertheless , the power law character of the gamma in the interval of scales , where it is defined with sufficient reliability , admits a fractal interpretation .",
    "other attributes of fractality , for instance , self - similarity of the structures , the proportion of voids in the volume , require a special study by suitable methods .",
    "the paper consideres the relations between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "the angular coefficient of the approximation line , which is plotted on the chosen region of the @xmath33 variation , defines the correlation dimension of the distribution ( co - dimension ) . the greater slope ( corresponding to the smaller dimension implies , on the average , a stronger decrease of density inside the volume and therefore a higher clustering of objects .",
    "the horizontal regions of the plot point , in the general case , to uniformity of distribution of objects in the sample on corresponding scales .    fig .",
    "1 shows the expected behaviour of the gamma in transition from fractal clustering on scales less than @xmath26 to uniform distribution on larger scales .",
    "the figure illustrates the informativeness of using the gamma in searching for the scale of change of the condition of clustering @xmath26 , provided that @xmath19 is well larger than @xmath26 .",
    "* the boundaries of the region of the highest completeness are denoted ( the zone of incompleteness along the radial axis and the region of strong interstellar extinction are usually excluded ) . * the density of the objects that fall within the spherical layer @xmath35 around each object ,",
    "that is , the density at a given distance from the object of the sample for the differential gamma , and the density in spheres of radius @xmath8 with the centres in the objects of the sample for the integral gamma are calculated ( the centres of the spheres are not included in the counts , i.e. the density of the `` neighbours '' is measured ) .",
    "the calculations are averaged .",
    "the results are presented on a logarithmic scale in the form of the relations @xmath32 and @xmath36 , @xmath34 and @xmath36 . *",
    "if a part of some sphere falls outside the sample limits with increasing working radius @xmath8 , the sphere is then excluded from the calculations .",
    "thus , with increasing working radius , only the spheres with the centres progressively nearing to that of the volume containing the sample are involved in the calculations .",
    "the calculations are terminated when the number of remaining spheres is @xmath37 .",
    "the method of calculation implemented in the present paper differs from the variant used by pietronero and his colleagues but in insignificant details ( the step of increasing the working radius , the number of finite spheres at which the calculations are terminated and others ) .",
    "we call this method of gamma calculation `` classical '' as distinct from modifications using various kinds of weighting of the regions of spheres falling outside the sample limits ( lemson & sanders , 1991 ; andreani et al . , 1991 ) and other procedures allowing more effective utilization of the whole volume of the sample",
    ". the demerit of the method is that the sample objects are unequal in rights since the objects located at the boundaries fall out rapidly from the calculation as the centres of spheres .",
    "therefore the result on large scales is strongly dependent on the distribution of a small number of objects near the centre of the volume being studied . from our estimates the gamma remains informative at a minimum number , 100200 , ( depending on the volume ) of objects , left in the sample .",
    "a detailed examination of the question is presented in sylos labini et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the problem of determining the error of approximation of the gamma slope in the region , where the power law decrease of density is observed , is difficult to overcome because there is no `` etalon '' of distribution for the gamma , as distinct from the statistics which compare in some way the distribution of a sample with uniform one .",
    "the dispersion of the gamma calculations with respect to the mean does not , strictly speaking , indicate the error of the mean value of the gamma since for an arbitrary distribution , for instance , fractal , the spread in values may be natural , and only the mean gamma values are of significance . the `` bootstrap '' method ( ling et al .",
    ", 1986 ; mo et al . , 1992 ) may possibly give correct estimates of the errors .",
    "the distances for all samples of galaxies were taken euclidean and were determined by the hubble law @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the radial velocity , and @xmath40 is the hubble constant .",
    "the k - correction was not taken into account .",
    "when changing the redshift values to metric distances for the clusters ( abell and apm ) , the following formula was used : @xmath41    the values @xmath42km / s / mpc for the hubble constant and @xmath43 for the deceleration parameter were used in the calculation by this formula .",
    "to analyse the gamma behaviour , diverse data were chosen which represented samples of physically isolated structures of luminous matter ( galaxies , clusters , superclusters ) , allowing the clustering on scales from 50kpc to @xmath44mpc to be estimated .",
    "this is a sample of nearby galaxies with radial velocities less than 500km / s with respect to the local group centroid .",
    "the original list made by kraan - korteweg and tammann ( 1979 ) numbered 179 objects .",
    "further it was substantially complemented by karachentsev ( the most complete compilation can be found in makarov s thesis ( 2000 ) .",
    "we will emphasize that this is the only sample with photometric estimates of distances of galaxies .",
    "we used a sample of 330 objects .",
    "of these 330 objects , 193 galaxies have photometric estimates of distances , for 47 objects the distances are taken from their membership in known groups , and only for the rest of the objects hubble distances ( @xmath45km / s / mpc ) were used .    a supergalactic `` disk '' , in which 80% of galaxies are concentrated ,",
    "is dominated in the distribution of the local volume galaxies .",
    "this is a flat structure that occupies the centre of the volume and becomes more dense in the direction toward virgo .",
    "practically all known groups of galaxies of the local volume ( the local group , m81 , ngc5128+ngc5236 ( centaurus ) , ngc4244+ngc4736 ( canes venatici ) , m101 ) are located in the disk . in the northern direction ( in supergalactic coordinates )",

    "the slope @xmath47 in the local volume is likely to be defined by the distribution geometry .",
    "the expected slope for a pancake - type structure is @xmath48 .",
    "the test with the use of random `` mixing '' of galaxies in the `` disk '' does not change essentially the result of the gamma - analysis .",
    "that is , strictly speaking , the distribution of galaxies in the local volume is largely inhomogeneous because of the presence of the `` local void '' , but not fractality .",
    "it is likely that the slope of the gamma towards small scales remains practically up to the size of a large galaxy ( @xmath49kpc ) owing to the dwarf companions of the most massive galaxies .",

    "the clusters have been catalogued with the highest statistical completeness in a certain middle interval of @xmath6 .",
    "a small number of nearby clusters might not be included in the catalogue because of large angular dimensions , and a considerable number , increasing towards the far boundary of the volume , of distant clusters because of the decreasing with distance contrast of the cluster and errors in the determination of the characteristic stellar magnitude of galaxies of the cluster .",

    "i.e. we see a correlation of the distribution on scales @xmath7930mpc , but the clustering is insignificant here .",
    "the interval from the point of break top to the limit of calculation of the gamma is considerable , from 30mpc to @xmath80mpc .",
    "the incompleteness of the measured @xmath6 does not affect the location of the break ; it is only the slope of @xmath15 that changes prior to the break point .      in this sample",

    ", 1989 ) with richness @xmath81 ( @xmath82 corresponds to the richness class @xmath83 ) which are located in the region @xmath84 , for which @xmath85 either measured or estimated according to leir and van den bergh ( 1977 ) . for 247 ( 77% ) out of 321 clusters",

    "for such rich clusters ( remind that the clusters with @xmath86 belong to the classes of richness @xmath87 ) at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath84 ) the catalogue of abell , perhaps , may not be considered as strongly distorted by the effects of incompleteness which could influence seriously the shape of the gamma . at the present time , this sample of clusters is likely to be the best one for our purpose both in its completeness and homogeneity and in coverage of the volume of space .",
    "the subsample of rich clusters that we have obtained allows one to follow the behaviour of the gamma in a very wide and probably in the most interesting range of scales , 10250mpc , in which from theoretical reasoning and from the available data an asymptotic transition to the homogeneous distribution of objects in space must be observed .",
    "it is exactly this behaviour of the gamma that has been detected ( see figs.10 and 11 ) .",
    "after the region of power law drop in density with the slope @xmath88 , starting from @xmath89mpc , a transitional interval follows with gradual decrease in slope , and beginning with the radius @xmath90  mpc , the distribution of clusters does not practically differ from homogeneous up to a limiting radius of 250mpc .",
    "the use of the sample in which only measured @xmath6 are present ( incomplete sample ) does not change essentially the gamma shape and shows that the result from the complete ( in the sense of location of objects in the volume ) sample is not practically distorted by the fact that for part of the clusters estimated @xmath6 have been taken .",
    "the inclusion into the sample of clusters with estimated @xmath6 leads only to reduction of the steepness of the slope on small scales , that is , `` blurring '' of clustering of clusters on the scales of superclusters occurs .",

    "can see an approximately `` coordinated '' break over different samples including the spheres with @xmath104mpc ( the first arrow ) . from the galaxies of the northern part of the sample cfa2+ssrs2 the extension of the region of the gamma",
    "after the break suggests that the break is most likely caused not by the boundary effects , but rather by the properties of distribution . for apm clusters the gamma has a break at @xmath105mpc , the limiting scale is 105mpc .",
    "the tendency of behaviour of this type gamma ( break and transition to other mode of clustering ) is terminated by deep samples of rich clusters and superclusters , nearly complete `` leveling out '' of the gamma ( the second and third arrows ) is observed .",
    "a trend of slope @xmath98 ( prior the break ) is noticeable over all samples , the dynamics and causes of which still remain to be solved . formally , the power law of the drop of density begins with scales @xmath106kpc , immediately after the size of a huge galaxy .",
    "we used rather heterogeneous data , even though the results obtained from different samples basically agree with each other in the main features , which allows some general conclusions to be drawn concerning the character of behaviour of the gamma on different scales .    1 .",
    "the shape of the correlation gamma function points to the density variation according to a power law .",
    "2 .   the power index on small scales ( prior the break ) changes within 0.91.5 . in principle",
    ", this corresponds to fractal distribution , but the scatter in slopes for different samples of objects of different nature makes questionable the possibility of describing a large - scale structure by a single fractal dimension .",
    "manifestations of fractality have been revealed on scales spanning nearly 3 orders of magnitude  from 50kpc to 30mpc .",
    "systematic variations of the gamma parameters obtained from cfa2+ssrs2 galaxies require additional investigation , although the tendency to `` leveling out '' of the gamma at @xmath107mpc for brighter objects is consistent with the results for clusters ( brighter galaxies concentrate towards the centres of clusters ) .",
    "5 .   on scales 3040mpc , in the cases where the gamma is calculated to scales well larger than 40mpc",
    ", a break is seen in the behaviour of the gamma ( index @xmath108 ) which implies the change of the condition and , possibly , a physical mechanism of clustering .",
    "6 .   from 30",
    "to 100120mpc the clustering is likely to occur , since on these scales isolated structures ( great wall , voids , etc . )",
    "are observed , but it is insignificant , for when increasing the scales , the density drops slightly .",
    "probably , the contrast ( amplitude ) of inhomogeneities on these scales is already small .",
    "an asymptotic transition to homogeneity @xmath109 might be supposed , mainly from the distribution of rich clusters and superclusters on scales 40120mpc .    as a whole , the correlation gamma - function is quite an interesting and informative way of describing a large - scale structure .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the influence of selection effects on the shape of the gamma is still not clearly studied .",
    "a study is required of model samples with expected properties of the gamma and properties introduced by real selection effects ( for instance , the density gradient along the radial coordinate ) .",
    "the limitation of scales of calculation by spheres located inside the sample boundaries does not solve the problems of boundary conditions completely , because the gamma becomes dependent on the location of significant structures inside the sample boundaries .",
    "this points to the necessity of careful selection of objects and choice of sample boundaries .",
    "the incompleteness of the sample may diminish the statistical significance of the result of gamma application .",
    "other methods should be involved to confirm the interpretation .",
    "nevertheless , it can be argued with assurance that our results of application of the gamma function are in fair agreement with theoretical considerations of the finitness of the range of scales with the fractal type of correlation of density and of gradual decrease of contrast of inhomogeneities with increasing volume of the region of the universe being studied .",

    "<S> using the apparatus of correlation gamma - function ( `` conditional density '' ) , we have analyzed spatial clustering of objects from several different samples of galaxies , clusters and superclusters . on small scales the distribution of objects obeys a power law drop of density with a power index of 0.91.5 . on a scale of @xmath0mpc for independent samples of bright galaxies and clusters of galaxies </S>",
    "<S> we have detected a pronounced break in the slope of the gamma - function with a power index decreasing to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the clustering is much less pronounced in the region from 40 to 100mpc , and there is reason to suppose that the distribution of objects changes to homogeneous on scales larger than 100mpc . </S>",
    "<S> this is indicated by the slope of the gamma - function close to 0 for a sample of rich clusters of galaxies up to 250mpc .    the slope of the gamma - function prior to the break , which characterizes the degree of clustering of matter , changes essentially and in a complex manner when passing to brighter ( massive ) objects . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the large - scale structure of the visible universe even on small scales is considerably more complex than the fractal distribution described by one dimension ( monofractal ) .    </S>",
