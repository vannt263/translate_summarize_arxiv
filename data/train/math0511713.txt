    "tropical varieties are polyhedral complexes which are the basic objects of study of tropical geometry .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of tropical varieties is that they inherit relevant geometric properties from their algebraic counterparts . in the present work",
    "we try to measure the differences in the behavior of the tropical varieties with respect to the algebraic ones . in particular ,",
    "we check if incidence theorems of classical projective geometry hold in the tropical context .",
    "the origin of this work is the pappus theorem counterexample showed in @xcite . in that paper , it is showed a tropical configuration of points and lines in the shape of pappus theorem hypothesis such that it does not verify pappus thesis . in particular , it implies that this configuration is not the projection of a similar configuration of points and lines in the algebraic plane .",
    "the authors provide then another alternative version of the same theorem and claimed that this new version would hold in the tropical context .",
    "the key of this new version of pappus theorem is that the hypothesis is given as the result of a geometric construction dealing with points and lines .",
    "the correctness of this theorem was showed in @xcite using some precursor techniques on geometric constructions .",
    "many incidence theorems can be given as a construction of a configuration of curves and points ( _ hypothesis _ ) and then some information is derived ( the _ thesis _ of the theorem ) .",
    "so we will focus on geometric constructions in the plane and how they behave with respect to tropicalization .",
    "intuitively , a geometric construction is a procedure that starts with a set of input curves and points and then define other curves and points by either intersecting two available curves or computing a curve defined by a polynomial of fixed support passing through a set of points ( a conic through five points , for example ) .",
    "the main algorithm we present consists in : taking a tropical instance of a geometric construction , computing a constructible set @xmath7 over the residual field of the valuation that encodes sufficient conditions for the compatibility of an algebraic geometric construction .",
    "we will also show some certificates during the computation to detect if a tropical realization of a geometric constructions is not the projection of any algebraic realization .",
    "then , we present the notion of _ admissible geometric construction_. this is a combinatorial notion defined on an associated graph of a geometric construction that ensure that for all tropical realization , the computed set @xmath7 is non empty and dense . that is",
    ", we will always be able to compute an algebraic preimage under the tropicalization @xmath6 .",
    "this notion can be applied to prove that some incidence theorems hold in the tropical context if we are able to describe their hypothesis as the output of an admissible geometric construction .",
    "we provide a notion of _ constructible incidence theorem _ that is compatible with tropicalization .",
    "in particular , we will show some theorems of this kind .",
