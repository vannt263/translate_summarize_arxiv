    "attempts to understand properties of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and their cosmological evolution has led to the conclusion that the agn activity as a whole is most likely to be described as a succession of episodic and time limited events happening in most if not all galaxies ( cavaliere & padovani 1989 , collin - souffrin 1991 ) .",
    "the most plausible explanation for the onset of activity is fuelling of the nucleus by gas streaming towards the center of the galaxy as a result of interaction , accretion or merging events .",
    "agn surrounded by an extended emission line region are of particular interest since most often gas lying very far from the center is revealed by the ionizing flux from the active nucleus .",
    "studying the kinematics and physical properties of this gas is a unique way towards disentangling the tight interaction between the gas motions and the nuclear activity ( see e.g. the case of ngc  4388 , where we have shown that the gas is certainly connected to the intracluster gas and that the source of ionization is not coincident with the optical nucleus , petitjean & durret 1993 ) . in such studies ,",
    "the knowledge of the host galaxy morphology is crucial since it strongly constrains the framework in which the observations should be analyzed ( presence of a companion , distorsion of the disk , orientation and inclination of the galaxy ) .",
    "a number of extended ionized nebulae have been detected with radii of the order of tens to hundreds of kpc from the nucleus itself ( see catalogues by durret 1989 , and heckman et al .",
    "the properties of these gaseous nebulae appear to be tightly correlated with the agn activity , in particular with the uv and radio emission ( mccarthy et al .",
    "1987 , durret 1990 ) , and the gas often suffers from important turbulent motions ( jorster et al .",
    "1984 , bergeron et al .",
    "1989 , heckman et al .",
    "1991 , durret et al .",
    "1994 ) . besides",
    ", the emission line widths are observed to increase with redshift ( heckman et al .",
    "1991 ) , implying that the properties of the gaseous nebulae evolve with redshift . for @xmath22",
    "the properties of the ionized gas around quasars and radio galaxies seem to be similar , as would be the case for similar objects seen from different viewing angles ( barthel 1989 ) .",
    "however , an analysis of the iras data for a sample of radio quasars and radio galaxies has shown a systematic difference between the ir properties of these two types of objects ( heckman et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the morphologies of the host galaxies have been investigated by hutchings ( 1987 ) through optical broad band images of radio galaxies and radio quasars ; he concludes that 80% of them are interacting .",
    "however , for objects with redshifts of about 0.3 , the [ oiii]@xmath3500.7 emission line is redshifted in the r band and can contribute most of the light .",
    "a striking example is ton  616 for which the [ oiii]@xmath3500.7 map ( durret et al . 1994 ) perfectly matches the r band image ( hutchings & mcclure 1990 ) . near infrared imaging",
    "is not sensitive to young stellar populations , but on the contrary allows to sample mainly the old stellar population and can reveal unambiguously the structure of the underlying host .",
    "moreover , near infrared images with a good spatial resolution in the k band are particularly well adapted to this purpose , since at these wavelengths the contributions of both dust and young ionizing stars are also minimized .",
    "the k band images will reveal the morphologies and near environments of the harboring galaxies , and allow us to connect the emitting gas morphology and kinematics ( when available ) with the potential of the underlying galaxy .",
    "in particular , such data should allow to study what kinds of perturbations could be invoked as the origin of the gas fuelling ( presence of close companions , nonaxisymmetrical perturbations in accretion or merging events , or tidal interacting forces ) .",
    "we present here observations in the j and k bands of a sample of eleven quasars that were known to be associated with an extended ionized nebulosity .",
    "three other nearby quasars ( indicated with an @xmath4 in table 1 ) were included because they had extensions in their optical images which could be contaminated by ionized gas emission lines .",
    "finally , a  0401 - 350a was observed serendipitously because it was in our redshift range and there was no object in our sample at this right ascension .",

    "we could extract the host galaxy for only four quasars in k , for which the host galaxy contributed 67 @xmath44 8 % in average to the total luminosity .",
    "for the four hosts extracted in both j and k , we find that their contributions are similar in both bands for iras  09149 - 6206 ( radio quiet ) and larger in k than in j for the remaining three ( radio loud ) , in agreement with the expectation that k describes the stellar population better than j. the average absolute magnitudes of the host galaxies are @xmath451.1 ( @xmath461.2 for the radio loud and @xmath470.5 for the radio quiet ) and @xmath480.6 .",

    ", we can not always discriminate whether asymmetric extensions are intrinsic or are the consequence of the presence of objects in projection close to the line of sight to the quasar .",
    "we have attempted to answer this question first by estimating the shape of the psf from starlike objects in the field , deconvolving the images and then subtracting the psf of the deconvolved image to the quasar infrared profile , and second by using high resolution optical images retrieved from the hst archives , which were available for eight of the observed qsos .",
    "it was possible to resolve the extensions into close objects for pks  0812 + 020 , pks  0837 - 120 and 3c 281 , though for the second quasar the elongated structure seems also to be present in the hst images , suggesting that the underlying galaxy is indeed detected .",
    "in all the other cases the infrared extensions are symmetric , as expected for a normal underlying host galaxy ; however , the corresponding average profiles are notably different from the psf profiles in only four qsos : iras  09149 - 6206 , pks  1302 - 102 , mrk  877 and mc  1745 + 163 ( see fig.[profiles ] ) , where the harboring galaxies are well fit by the r@xmath35 profile describing elliptical galaxies . out of these four quasars ,",
    "note that pks  1302 - 102 and mc  1745 + 163 are radio loud , while iras  09149 - 6206 and mrk  877 are radio quiet .    note that although hst images were needed to resolve close objects , they have proven to be sometimes less efficient to detect low surface brightness features , as for pks  1302 - 102 ( bahcall et al .",
    "1995 , see section 3.8 ) . for 3c  215 , the hst image does not allow to trace the elongation due to the host galaxy , whereas our j image does .",
    "the present study confirms that infrared imaging is well adapted to detect underlying galaxies in quasars , after objects located close to the quasar are identified with high spatial resolution imaging ( hst or adaptive optics ground based data ) .",
    "one of the possibilities to explain the presence of extended gaseous envelopes around qsos is to claim their belonging to rich environments , with the presence of close companions producing the physical mechanisms ( tidal forces or nonaxisymmetrical perturbations in accretion or merger events ) that can account for gas fuelling .",
    "a number of redshifts have been measured for the objects in the vicinity of five of the qsos we have observed : pks  0812 + 020 , pks  0837 - 120 , 3c 215 , 3c 275.1 and 4c 11.50 .",
    "note that out of these five quasars four are known to be rich in ionized gas , and the only one for which ionized gas has not been reported is pks  0837 - 120 , which belongs to a richness class 1 cluster .",
    "for all five quasars , between one and five galaxies were found to have redshifts similar to that of the quasar .",
    "the presence of such a large number of companion objects is therefore likely to imply the existence of environmental effects which could account for the existence of extended ionized nebulosities in most of these objects .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have redshift informations for field objects around the ten other qsos in our sample .",
    "however , our infrared imaging shows that at least in projection most of these quasars have a number of galaxies in their environments . 3c 334 has at least one close galaxy , and some of the objects close to pks  1011 - 282 and 4c 20.33 seem to be galaxies as well , while the fields around iras 09149 - 6206 and mc  1745 + 163 are crowded with mostly star like objets .",
    "in order to improve such a study of the physical parameters of the underlying galaxies of quasars , and to describe their environments , high spatial resolution deeper infrared images of larger fields and with a higher sensitivity are obviously required ( in particular , our limiting magnitudes together with the small frame sizes we are dealing with ",
    "less than 1   result in small object numbers that prevent a reliable statistical analysis of colors and number counts of companions , such as that performed by hall & green 1998 ) .",
    "after the neighbouring objects are detected and galaxies are separated from stars , spectroscopy is necessary to determine which galaxies really belong to the quasar environment .",
