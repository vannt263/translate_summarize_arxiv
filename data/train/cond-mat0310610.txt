    "the local - density approximation was used to simplify the calculations and lead to analytical results in the thomas - fermi limit .",
    "this approximation is accurate only in the interior of the condensate and not near the thomas - fermi surface or away from it .",
    "the critical frequency obtained using this approximation is thus not expected to be accurate .",
    "therefore , we solve the problem numerically including kinetic energy effects at the surface .",
    "this leads to more accurate values for the critical frequency that compare reasonably with experiment .",
    "it should be also noted that our criterion for vortex nucleation , which is requiring that the energy barrier vanish , may be too restrictive .",
    "when the height of the energy barrier is nonzero but small enough , the vortex can tunnel through it and thus nucleate at a rotation frequency that is less than the one we calculated in the previous section . in this sense , our calculated critical frequency may be regarded as an upper bound to the vortex nucleation frequency .",

    "since the vortex axis is parallel to the @xmath16-axis and the vortex is moving in the @xmath15-direction , the nontrivial contributions to the energy arise only from integrating over @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , we calculate the energy of the vortex per unit length of the @xmath16-direction , which means that we have to perform only integrals in the @xmath14-@xmath15 plane .",
    "it is , thus convenient to shift the origin of @xmath23 from the surface of the condensate to the core of the vortex and to express the integral of energy functional in the polar coordinates @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "explicitly , we make the transformation @xmath159 .",

    "we can approximate @xmath163 by its value at @xmath3 and take it out of the integration .",
