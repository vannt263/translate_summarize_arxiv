    "the production of massive vector bosons @xmath6 in high - energy nuclear collisions has long been regarded as an excellent tool to probe the initial - state cold nuclear matter  ( cnm ) effects in the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( hic ) at the lhc because @xmath6 do not participate in strong interactions and the mean - free - path of massive vector bosons ( or more precisely , the leptons decayed from @xmath6 ) is rather long  @xcite . in proposed heavy - ion programs at the future circular collider ( fcc ) at cern  @xcite , and the circular electron positron collider with a subsequent super proton - proton collider ( cepc - sppc ) in china  @xcite , the vector gauge boson productions may still play a very important role in investigating the high - density qcd in the initial - state and making precise constraints on cnm effects and nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) at very small @xmath7 .",

    "even though the hot / dense qcd matter to be created in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the fcc and the cepc - sppc may have a much higher initial temperature and longer lifetimes  @xcite , the vector boson with the final state colorless di - lepton would still be nearly blind to the medium evolution  @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown that the heavy gauge boson production in nuclear reactions at the lhc energies could shed light on several cnm effects , especially the shadowing and anti - shadowing effects  ( for @xmath12 ) and isospin effect  ( for @xmath13 )  @xcite . in the conceptual designs of fcc",

    "one can observe that the nuclear modification of @xmath93 due to isospin effect increases with @xmath118 and decreases with the collision energy .",
    "actually @xmath93 s nuclear modification also increases with its value in proton - proton collisions which is related to the parton distribution asymmetry ratio @xmath119 and @xmath120  ( definition can be found in [ section : appendix ] ) .",
    "[ fig : caspt ] demonstrates the isospin effect will be reduced in the future hic .    from the numerical results we note that the differences among various nowadays npdfs sets are considerable . as an example",
    ", we calculate the ratio of the @xmath115 at the lhc  ( @xmath62  tev ) to that at future energy  ( @xmath3  tev ) for total @xmath5 production , as @xmath121 the results for @xmath122  gev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : w - raampt@ppb ] .",
    "one can observe that eps09 and dssz predict similar ratios of @xmath45 at the lhc and future hic , with very flat @xmath123 dependence .",
    "however , ncteq gives a very different result : the ratio is obviously larger than those with the other two npdfs , and increases faster with @xmath123 .",

    "we investigate in this paper the initial cold nuclear matter effects on the heavy vector boson production in the future nuclear collisions . within the framework of perturbative qcd",
    ", we numerically calculate the nuclear modification ratios of the @xmath0 boson rapidity distribution , the charged lepton pseudo - rapidity dependence for @xmath5 production , as well as @xmath6 transverse momentum spectra .",
    "both pb+pb collisions at @xmath3  tev and p+pb collisions at @xmath2  tev are studied , where the cnm effects are included by utilizing the parameterized nuclear parton distribution functions sets  ( eps09 , dssz and ncteq ) .",
    "different nuclear modifications from those at the lhc energies could be found .",
    "first , the nuclear shadowing effect would play a more important role in massive gauge boson production in the future hic . as consequences ,",
    "both the ( pseudo-)rapidity dependence and transverse momentum distribution of the boson would receive suppressions in a wide regime .",
    "second , the nuclear isospin effect would be rather weak in the future nuclear reactions , which could be clearly observed in the @xmath13 production .",
    "for example , the @xmath85 production in the future hic is even suppressed in the @xmath116  gev region , though at the lhc it is enhanced by isospin effect .",
    "these very distinct nuclear modifications at the future hic with those at the lhc result mainly from the smaller momentum fraction @xmath7 carried by the initial partons at the fixed rapidity or @xmath4 . at the lhc",
    ", the momentum fraction of the initial - state partons may fall in the anti - shadowing region  ( for eps09 ) , however in the future hic it may be seen in the kinematic region of the shadowing effect .",
    "furthermore , the calculations of the contribution rates for various partonic subprocesses show that the valence quarks gradually lose their relevance with the increasing colliding energy because of their sharply depleted densities in the smaller-@xmath7 region . with the highly suppressed @xmath106 and @xmath124 valence quark distributions ,",
    "the valence quark density asymmetry is minor , and the isospin effects would become much weaker in the future hic .",
    "in addition , large differences among results with several parametrization sets of npdfs could also be seen at the future hic .",
    "for example , results with ncteq predict more suppression for the vector boson yields than that with eps09 and dssz in future hic .",
    "the theoretical understanding of nuclear modifications of pdfs in nuclear collisions is far from satisfactory , and the massive gauge boson production in the future hic could provide an excellent probe of the shadowing effect on the nuclear sea quark distribution as well as gluon density by imposing new and precise constraints on the npdfs at rather small-@xmath7 .",
    "we calculate the @xmath125 of the valence and sea quarks in a proton with the mstw2008 pdfs  @xcite as @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
    "the results of @xmath106 and @xmath124 quarks are plotted in the panels  ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : cvs&rud ] , respectively .",
    "one can see that for both @xmath106 and @xmath124 , valence quark @xmath129 increase with the parton momentum fraction @xmath7 , and decrease with the collision energy .",
    "the parton distribution asymmetry @xmath130 and @xmath131 defined as @xmath132 are also plotted in the panels  ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : cvs&rud ] .",
    "one could observe that the parton distribution asymmetries are small in the low-@xmath7 region . as a result",
    ", the isospin effect would be moderate in that region .",
    "we also mark at the @xmath7-axis the points corresponding to different energies according to the relation @xmath133 .",
    "the marked values in panels  ( a ) and ( b ) are obtain with @xmath134 and those in ( c ) and ( d ) with @xmath135 .     of valence and sea for @xmath106 and @xmath124 quarks in a proton .",

    "the correlation between the @xmath136 of valence quark and the parton asymmetry ratio @xmath130  ( and @xmath131 ) should be emphasized",
    ". actually , the parton distribution asymmetry is to a large extent caused by the valence quark  ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) density asymmetry , as a result the tenuous valence quark density would give a much weaker @xmath137 ( or @xmath138 ) in the small-@xmath7 regime .",
