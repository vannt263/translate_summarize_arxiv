    "samples of ferroelectric single crystals often posses a surface layers .",
    "its existence greatly influences properties of bulk samples@xcite as well as of thin films.@xcite equilibrium domain structure in the system , mentioned above in the abstract , and the role of the surface layers was first discussed by bjorkstam and oettel@xcite in a special case of shorted electrodes . in our recent paper@xcite we reconsidered this problem in a general case of nonzero voltage between electrodes , discussing the response of the domain structure to external electric field .",
    "our calculations are valid also for thin films and present , in fact , continuation of our discussion of domain structures of thin films@xcite .    in@xcite we used our theoretical results for prediction of extrinsic contribution to permittivity of the sample . in the next two sections we give a short review of notation , description of the model and basic results from@xcite . in last two sections we discuss as an example the extrinsic contribution to @xmath0 piezoelectric coefficient of @xmath2 .",
    "we compare our predictions with the recent measurements of record values @xmath3 in temperature range 35k under critical temperature 146k@xcite ( see also@xcite ) .",
    "we consider a plate - like electroded sample of infinite area with major surfaces perpendicular to the ferroelectric axis @xmath4 .",
    "central ferroelectric part with antiparallel domains ( 2 . ) is separated from the electrodes ( 0 . ) , ( 4 . ) by nonferroelectric layers ( 1.),(3 . )",
    "( see fig.[arta2:fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of the electric field @xmath5 is determined by the applied potential difference @xmath6 and by the bound charge div@xmath7 on the boundary of ferroelectric material , where @xmath7 stands for spontaneous polarization .",
    "geometrical , electrical and material parameters of the system are shown in fig.[arta2:fig : geometry ] .",
    "we further introduce the symbols @xmath8 and several geometrical parameters : the slab factor @xmath9 the domain pattern factor @xmath10 and the asymmetry factor @xmath11 the ferroelectric material itself is approximated by the equation of state @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the spontaneous polarization along the ferroelectric axis .",
    "this linear approximation limits the validity of our calculations to the temperature region not very close below the transition temperature @xmath14 .",
    "domain walls are assumed to have surface energy density @xmath15 and zero thickness .",
    "rather cumbersome calculations@xcite lead to the following formula for gibbs electric energy per unit area of the system ( in @xmath16 ) , which includes the domain wall energy , the electrostatic energy whose density is @xmath17 and the work performed by external electric sources @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the charge on positive electrode .",
    "@xmath20 the first term represents domain wall contribution while the last one is the depolarization energy . in the second term",
    "we recognize the effect of layers ( 1 . ) and ( 3 . ) and of the applied voltage .    in this model",
    "we neglect the mechanical interactions between components of the system . for given slab factor",
    "@xmath21 and voltage @xmath22 , the equilibrium domain structure , characterized by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , corresponds to local minimum of @xmath25 . in general a minimum",
    "can be found by numerical methods , but for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the @xmath28 and @xmath24 can be approximated by explicit formulae . for purpose of this paper",
    "we use the following formula for @xmath24 @xmath29^{-1 }      \\label{arta2:eq : aeqv}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is considered as a small correction and @xmath31 is equilibrium value of @xmath32 for zero voltage @xmath22 . for the extrinsic contribution to permittivity of the sample we get from ( [ arta2:eq : aeqv ] ) ( see also@xcite ) @xmath33      \\right\\}^{-1 } \\label{arta2:eq : eext}\\ ] ]",
    "as an example , in this section we work out the approximate prediction of extrinsic contribution to @xmath0 of @xmath34 ( rdp ) , based on our simple model .",
    "rdp is a ferroelastic with spontaneous strain @xmath35 , opposite in opposite polarized domains . in the fig.[arta2:fig : symds]a there is @xmath36 cut through symmetric domain structure ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) .",
    "the situation after application of @xmath39 is shown in fig.[arta2:fig : asymds]b ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "a simple geometric consideration leads to the formula for average strain @xmath41 of the sample ( we neglect the mechanical coupling of the central part with the rest of the sample ) @xmath42    for the extrinsic coefficient @xmath0 we get from ( [ arta2:eq : aeqv ] ) and ( [ arta2:eq : avgstrain ] ) @xmath43^{-1 } \\label{arta2:eq : d36}\\ ] ] neglecting the small @xmath44 and for @xmath45 we get more simple formula in ( [ arta2:eq : d36simple ] ) is not correct , because the assumptions needed for validity of ( [ arta2:eq : aeqv ] ) are violated if @xmath21 is very small . ]",
    "an extremely high @xmath0 under @xmath14 for rdp was first reported in@xcite . in a recent paper@xcite ,",
    "sidorkin deduced the dispersion law of domain wall vibrations , however , in his treatment the existence of a surface layers is not explicitly considered .",
    "we can fit our theoretical results to measured ones@xcite - @xmath47 in the 35k range plateau under @xmath14 . using values that roughly apply to rdp : , see@xcite . ] in ( [ arta2:eq : d36simple ] ) resp .",
    "( [ arta2:eq : eext ] ) we come to an agreement for reasonable value of @xmath48 . naturally for lower temperatures ,",
    "the motion of the walls is limited by  freezing \" and both @xmath49 and @xmath50 decrease to zero .",
    "it is also interesting , for measurements in@xcite with alternating @xmath51 , that corresponding amplitude of alternating @xmath52 from ( [ arta2:eq : aeqv ] ) is only @xmath53 and displacement of the walls with @xmath54 is of the order @xmath55 ."
