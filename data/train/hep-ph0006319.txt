    "there have been a few experiments which suggest neutrino oscillations : the solar neutrino deficit @xcite the atmospheric neutrino anomaly @xcite and the lsnd data @xcite .",
    "if we assume that all these three are caused by neutrino oscillations then we need at least four species of neutrinos and schemes with sterile neutrinos have been studied by many people @xcite . by generalizing the discussion on big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) from the two neutrino scheme @xcite to four neutrino case",
    ", it has been shown @xcite that the neutrino mixing angles are strongly constrained not only by the reactor data @xcite but also by bbn if one demands that the number @xmath5 of effective neutrinos be less than four . in this case",
    "the @xmath6 mns matrix @xcite splits approximately into two @xmath7 block diagonal matrices , and the solar neutrino deficit is explained by @xmath8 oscillations with the small mixing angle ( sma ) msw solution @xcite and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is accounted for by @xmath9 . on the other hand , some people have given conservative estimate for @xmath5 @xcite and if their estimate is correct then we no longer have strong constraints on the mixing angles of sterile neutrinos .",
    "recently giunti , gonzalez - garcia and pea - garay @xcite have analyzed the solar neutrino data in the four neutrino scheme without bbn constraints .",
    "they have shown that the scheme is reduced to the two neutrino framework in which only one free parameter @xmath10 appears in the analysis .",
    "their conclusion is that the sma msw solution exists for the entire region of @xmath11 , while the large mixing angle ( lma ) and vacuum oscillation ( vo ) solutions survive only for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . in this paper",
    "the superkamiokande atmospheric neutrino data ( contained and upward going through @xmath0 events ) are analyzed in the same scheme as in @xcite , i.e. , in the four neutrino scheme with all the constraints of accelerators and reactors and without bbn constraints .",
    "zenith angle dependence of atmospheric neutrinos has been analyzed by many theorists @xcite as well as by experimentalists @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the notation in @xcite for the @xmath6 mns matrix : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a @xmath18 orthogonal matrix with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are diagonal elements of the @xmath23 generators",
    ".    we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath24 three mass scales @xmath25 or @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are necessary to explain the suppression of the @xmath29be solar neutrinos @xcite , the zenith angle dependence of the atmospheric neutrino data @xcite , and the lsnd data @xcite , so we assume that three independent mass squared differences which are obtained from ( [ eqn : inequality ] ) are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "it has been known @xcite that schemes with three degenerate masses and one distinct massive state do not work to account for all the three neutrino anomalies , but schemes with two degenerate massive states ( @xmath33 , where ( a ) @xmath34 or ( b ) @xmath35 ) do . as far as the analyses of atmospheric neutrinos and solar neutrinos are concerned , the two cases ( a ) and ( b ) can be treated in the same manner , so we assume @xmath36 , @xmath37 in the following .    for the range of the @xmath38 suggested by the lsnd data , which is given by 0.2 ev@xmath39 2 ev@xmath40 when combined with the data of bugey @xcite and e776 @xcite ,",
    "the constraint by the bugey data is very stringent and @xmath41 for simplicity in the following discussions .",
    "also in the analysis of atmospheric neutrinos , @xmath42 is satisfied for typical values of the neutrino path length @xmath43 and the neutrino energy @xmath44 for atmospheric neutrinos , so we assume @xmath45 for simplicity throughout this paper .    in the following analysis",
    "we will consider the situation where non - negligible contributions from the largest mass squared difference @xmath46 appear in the oscillation probability @xmath47 . to avoid contradiction with the negative result of the cdhsw disappearing experiment on @xmath48 @xcite",
    ", we will take @xmath46=0.3ev@xmath40 as a reference value .",
    "having assumed @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we have only mixings among @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 in the analysis of atmospheric neutrinos , and the schrdinger equation we have to consider is @xmath54 \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\nu_{\\mu}(x ) \\\\",

    "since @xmath59 does not oscillate with any other neutrinos , the only oscillation probability which is required in the analysis of atmospheric neutrinos is @xmath47 . in the present case",
    ", we have mass hierarchy @xmath60 and @xmath61 we can obtain the analytical expression for the oscillation probability @xmath47 in adiabatic approximation , i.e. , assuming that the derivative @xmath62 is not large compared to @xmath63 .",
    "as we will see in the appendix , with such approximation we can show that the oscillation probability @xmath47 is invariant under @xmath64 and @xmath65 to the leading order in @xmath66 and @xmath61 .",
    "so we will study our scheme for the range @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "note that all the three mixing angles would lie in the first quadrant @xcite if there were no matter effects .",

    "zenith angle dependence for no oscillation case that we obtained is reasonably in good agreement with the superkamiokande result @xcite and this puts confidence to the present analysis . in general",
    ", the reason that the best fit point is slightly away from pure @xmath9 case is because a better fit to the multi - gev contained events compensates a worse fit to the upward going through @xmath0 events , and in total the case of hybrid oscillations of @xmath9 and @xmath2 fits better to the data ( see figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) ) .",
    "\\(1 ) pure @xmath2 oscillation is obtained only for @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and in this case @xmath87 satisfies @xmath12817.9 for any value of @xmath129 , @xmath117 and @xmath130 and it implies that pure @xmath2 oscillation is excluded at 99.7%cl ( 3.0@xmath4cl ) .",
    "this is consistent with the recent claim by superkamiokande group @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) for some @xmath129 , @xmath117 @xmath130 ( e.g. , @xmath129=1.3@xmath131ev@xmath40 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath118 ) , @xmath134 is allowed at 90%cl , and one might wonder how such a solution can give a reasonable fit to the data . for this set of the oscillation parameters ,",
    "we find that the oscillation probabilities without matter effects are given by @xmath135 , \\label{eqn : hybrid}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and we have averaged over rapid oscillations which come from @xmath138 . from ( [ eqn : hybrid ] ) we observe that zenith angle dependence with a non - maximal coefficient comes solely from @xmath2 oscillation and both @xmath139 and @xmath2 oscillations have constant contribution in the oscillation probabilities . as was shown in @xcite , the zenith angle dependence of contained events",
    "is explained well also by @xmath2 oscillation , but the fit of @xmath2 to upward going @xmath0 events is poor @xcite . in the present case , we have @xmath140=19.7 , @xmath141=15.5 , @xmath142=15.0 and we observe that this solution is allowed at 90%cl because a poor fit to the upward going through @xmath0 events is compensated by a good fit to the multi - gev contained events .",
    "\\(3 ) one of the remarkable features of our result is that there is a region where relatively small value of @xmath143 is allowed at 90%cl for @xmath144 , i.e. , there exists a solution in which all the mixing angles are relatively small @xmath145 , and such situation does not occur for @xmath126 .",
    "this phenomena is reminiscent of the work @xcite on three flavor analysis of the atmospheric neutrino data , in which it was argued that relatively small mixing angles could account for the data because of matter effects if there were no chooz constraint @xcite .",
    "however , in the present case it turns out that the matter effect is not so important , i.e. , even if we put the density of the matter to zero the fit to the data is still reasonable .",
    "the reason that the fit to the data is good for @xmath146 is because the disappearance probability behaves as @xmath147 ( @xmath148 are constant ) and even if the coefficient @xmath149 is relatively small the presence of the constant term @xmath150 compensates the goodness of the fit to a certain extent .",
    "this argument applies both to the multi - gev @xmath0-like contained events and the upward going through muon events .",
    "\\(4 ) to combine the present result with the analysis of the solar neutrinos in @xcite , it is necessary to obtain the value of @xmath151 for each point . in our parametrization ( [ eqn : u ] )",
    "we have @xmath152 so that @xmath153 the contours of @xmath1540.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 are plotted together with the allowed region for various @xmath129 in fig .",
    "3(a ) ( @xmath118 ) , 3(b ) ( @xmath119 ) and 3(c ) ( @xmath120 ) . for each value of @xmath130",
    "some point in the allowed region satisfies @xmath155 for @xmath156 .",
    "we find that the allowed region at 90% confidence level satisfies @xmath157 for @xmath118 , @xmath158 for @xmath119 , @xmath159 for @xmath120 , respectively",
    ". hence combination of the present result with the analysis in @xcite suggests that the lma and vo solutions as well as sma solution of the solar neutrino problem are possible for some region in the parameter space .",
    "recently superkamiokande group has announced @xcite that the sma and vo solutions of the solar neutrino problem are disfavored at 95% confidence level .",
    "if nature is described by a four neutrino scenario , therefore , the present scheme with @xmath155 may be the right solution for all the oscillation data .",
    "we have shown in the framework of four neutrino oscillations without assuming the bbn constraints that the superkamiokande atmospheric neutrino data are explained by wide range of the oscillation parameters which implies hybrid oscillations of @xmath9 and @xmath2 as well as hybrid oscillations with @xmath160 and @xmath161 . the case of pure @xmath2",
    "is excluded at 3.0@xmath4cl in good agreement with the superkamiokande analysis .",
    "it is found by combining the analysis on the solar neutrino data by giunti , gonzalez - garcia and pea - garay that the lma and vo solutions as well as sma solution of the solar neutrino problem are allowed .",
    "this gives us another possibility in phenomenology of neutrino oscillations and such scenarios deserve further study .",
