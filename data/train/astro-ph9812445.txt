    "the nature and origin of cosmic radiation has presented a challenge since its detection , some 80 years ago , in a series of pioneering ballon flights by victor hess @xcite . already in 1938 , it was clear from the observation of extensive air showers ( produced by energetic cosmic rays ( crs ) interacting in the high atmosphere ) @xcite that the cr - spectrum reached at least @xmath0 ev , and continuously running monitoring indicated that the departure from isotropy was no greater than the statistical uncertainty of the measurements . after the discovery of the microwave background radiation ( mbr ) @xcite , it became obvious that ultra high energy particles undergo reactions with the relic photons ( which they see as higly blue shifted ) , and so extremely high energy cosmic rays ( ehecrs ) can not come from cosmologically large distances @xcite .",
    "ev while ehecrs refers to the ones with energies above @xmath1 ev .",
    "history does not always choose the best variables , and i shall undistinguishably refer to them , specifing explicitly when speaking of events above @xmath1 ev . ] assuming a cosmologically homogeneus population of sources , usually referred to as the universal hypothesis , this interaction produces the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cut - off around @xmath2 ev .",
    "however , ingenious installations with large effective areas and long exposure times needed to overcome the increasingly low flux , have raised the maximum observed primary particle energy to higher than @xmath1 ev ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) . in particular ,",
    "the fly s eye experiment recorded the world s highest energy cosmic ray event to date , with an energy proximately to 300 eev @xcite .",
    "the evidence for anysotropy of ehecr arrival directions is suggestive but statistically very weak .",
    "the analyses of the data sets of both haverah park @xcite and agasa @xcite have suggested that the events with primary energy @xmath3 eev reached the earth preferentially from the general direction of the supergalactic plane , a swath in the sky along which radio galaxies are clustered .",
    "however , the fly s eye group @xcite reported a small anisotropy towards the galactic plane at energies around @xmath4 ev , confirmed later by the the agasa experiment @xcite ( two analyses that did not reveal a significant correlation with the supergalactic plane ) .",
    "recent observations dramatically confirms that the cr - spectrum does not end with the gzk cut - off @xcite .",
    "besides , the newest data world sample above @xmath1 ev has no imprint of possible correlations with the galactic plane or supergalactic plane @xcite .",
    "theoretical subtleties surrounding the production of particles with energies below @xmath1 ev have remained a puzzle .",
    "acceleration in astrophysical settings occurs when charged primaries , namely protons and heavy nuclei , achieve high energies through repeated encounters with moving magnetized plasmas ( `` bottom up '' mechanisms ) @xcite .",
    "preferred sites are supernova shocks , galactic wind termination shocks , or relativistic shocks associated with active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and radio galaxies ( known to be powerful sources of radio , gamma radiation , and super - relativistic jets ) .",
    "although in this last case , acceleration up to around @xmath5 ev seems to be possible by stretching the reasonable values for the shock size and the magnetic field strength at the shock somewhat , for the highest events , there seem to be no suitable extragalactic objects such us agns or active galaxy clusters near the observed arrival direction and within a maximum distance of about 50 mpc ( the estimated angular deflection for a proton of @xmath1 ev is 2.1@xmath6 ) .",
    "the gamma ray burst ( grb ) phenomenon , which itself is also an oustanding mistery in astrophysics , has been considered as one of the candidates for the origin of ehecrs @xcite .",
    "grbs are generally related with catastrophic ( explosive ) events during which cr particles may be shocked accelerated to extreme energies , besides , the total energy and ocurrence rate of grbs are in rough agreement with the production rate of ehecrs . however , the model is not free of problems , as can be see , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the difficulties encountered by conventional acceleration mechanisms in accelerating particles to the highest observed energies have motivated suggestions in the sense that the underlying production mechanism could be , perhaps , of non - aceleration nature . in the so - called `` top down '' models , charged and neutral primaries are produced at extremely high energies , typically by quantum mechanical decay of supermassive elementary @xmath7 particles related to grand unify theories @xcite .",
    "these exotic particles have also been suggested as primaries @xcite .",
    "an alternative ( perhaps mischievously ) explanation for the ehecrs requires the breakdown of local lorentz invariance .",
    "namely , tiny departures from lorentz invariance , too small to have been detected otherwise , might affect elementary particle kinematics in such a way that some hadronic resonances which are inestable at low energies would become stable at very high energies . therefore the gzk cut - off can be relaxed or removed @xcite .",
    "it could be found some even more `` exotic '' : the recently detected energetic particles may have shortcut their journey traversing a wormhole .",
    "the question then could be not from where do the rays come , but from when ! ! !    deepening the mistery , the particle identity is still unknown .",
    "the fly s eye analysis suggested a transition from a spectrum dominated by heavy nuclei to a predominantly light composition above a few times @xmath8 ev .",
    "however , it may be worth mentioning that proton induced air shower monte carlo does not fit the shower development of the highest event with high precision .",
    "a primary heavy nucleus fits more closely the shower development and neutrinos can not be excluded as atypical primaries neither @xcite .",
    "the situation is not settled down because fluctuations in the shower development are known to be large . on the one hand , heavy nuclei have their own merits because they can be deflected considerably by the galactic magnetic field which relaxes the source direction requirements , and they can be accelerated to higher terminal energies because of their higher charge . on the other hand cosmic ray nuclei with energies in excess of @xmath9",
    "ev can not originate from sources beyond 10 mpc @xcite .",
    "weakly interacting particles such as neutrinos will have no difficulty in propagating through the intergalactic medium , namely the corresponding mean free path @xmath10 cm is just above the present size of the horizon , @xmath11 cm @xcite .",
    "many sources of extremely high energy neutrinos are known , they can be produced in astrophysical objects by the decay of pions or kaons generated as subproducts of proton - photon interactions during the acceleration processes @xcite or else by `` top down '' mechanisms @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the neutrino flux might extend even up to @xmath12 - @xmath13 ev .",
    "however , at these energies the atmosphere is still transparent to neutrinos , and most of them will impact on earth @xcite . cosmic ray neutrino annihilation onto relic neutrinos in the galactic halo",
    "was suggested as an alternative source of ehecrs @xcite , but as the previous ones , this is not a truly satisfactory solution @xcite .",
    "summing up , the gzk cut - off provides an important constraint on the proximity of ehecr ( nucleons and nuclei ) sources , thus , the origin of the events with energies above 100 eev has became one of the most pressing questions of cosmic ray astrophysics .",
    "this summary is ordered as follows .",
    "the next section is devoted to revisit the effect of mbr on ehecrs using the continuous energy - loss ( cel ) .",
    "it is a matter of fact , that even when transport equations may be as complicated as one can afford , some simple assumptions makes results agree , within a typical few percent , with those genereted by numerical code , thus allowing for the isolation of essential physics .",
    "this is exactly what is needed here in order to study the the footprint left by the relic photons in the energy spectrum and how can this be used to extract testeable predictions . in sec .",
    "3 , using polarization measurements and synchrotron emission as a trace , we analyze concrete candidates for testing the acceleration models that involve hot spots and strong shock waves as the source of the ultra - high energy component of the cr - spectrum . sec . 4 will deal with the influence of different hadronic models on extensive air showers .",
    "the hadronic models considered are those implemented in the well - known qgsjet @xcite and sibyll @xcite event generators .",
    "the different approaches used in both codes to model the underlying physics are analyzed using computer simulations performed with the program aires @xcite .",
    "the aim of this section is to present a simplify model of the propagation of ehecrs which reproduces the essential elements of the highly sophisticated computer calculations to within a few percent .        if one assumes that the highest energy cosmic rays are indeed nucleons , the fractional energy loss due to interactions with the cosmic background radiation at temperature @xmath14 and redshift @xmath15 , is determined by the integral of the nucleon loss energy per collision times the probability per unit time for a nucleon collision moving through an isotropic gas of photons @xcite .",
    "this integral can be explicitly written as follows , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the photon energy in the rest frame of the nucleon , and @xmath18 is the average fraction of the energy lost by the photon to the nucleon ( in the @xmath19th reaction channel ) in the laboratory frame ( i.e. the frame in which the microwave background radiation is at @xmath20k ) .",
    "the sum is carried out over all channels , @xmath21 stands for the number density of photons with energy between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , following a planckian distribution @xcite at temperature @xmath14 , @xmath24 is the total cross section of the ( @xmath19th ) interaction channel , @xmath25 is the usual lorentz factor of the nucleon , and @xmath26 is the maximum energy of the photon in the photon gas .",
    "thus , the fractional energy loss is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are boltzmann s and planck s constants respectively , and @xmath30 is the threshold energy for the @xmath19th reaction in the rest frame of the nucleon .",
    "the characteristic time for the energy loss due to pair production at @xmath31 ev is @xmath32 yr @xcite and therefore it does not affect the spectrum of nucleons arriving from nearby sources . consequently , for nucleons with @xmath33ev ( taking into account the interaction with the tail of the planck distribution ) ,",
    "meson photoproduction is the dominant mechanism for energy loss .",
    "notice that we do not distinguish between neutrons and protons ; in addition , the inelasticity due to the neutron @xmath34 decay is negligible .    in order to determine the effect of meson photoproduction on the spectrum of cosmic rays , we first examine the kinematics of photon - nucleon interactions . assuming that reactions mediated by baryon resonances have spherically symmetric decay angular distributions @xcite , the average energy loss of the nucleon after n resonant collisions is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the mass of the resonant system of the chain , @xmath37 the mass of the associated meson",
    ", @xmath38 is the total energy of the reaction in the centre of mass , and @xmath39 the mass of the nucleon .",
    "it is well established from experiments @xcite that , at very high energies ( @xmath40 above @xmath41 gev ) , the incident nucleons lose one - half their energy via pion photoproduction independently of the number of pions produced ( leading particle effect ) .    in the region dominated by baryon resonances ,",
    "the cross section is described by a sum of breit - wigner distributions ( constructed from the experimental data in the table of particle properties @xcite ) considering the main resonances produced in @xmath42 collisions with @xmath43 final states . for the cross section at high energies we used the fits to the high - energy cross section @xmath44 made by the cern , desy hera , and compas groups @xcite . in this energy range ,",

    "( [ phds ! ] ) is performed taking into account the aforementioned resonance decays and the production of multipion final states at higher centre of mass energies ( @xmath46 gev ) .",
    "a @xmath47 fit of the numerical results of equation ( [ phds ! ] ) with an exponential behaviour , @xmath48 , proposed by berezinsky and grigoreva @xcite for the region of resonances , gives : @xmath49 , @xmath50 ev with a @xmath51 . at high energies",
    "the fractional energy loss was fitted with a constant , @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "these results differ from those obtained in @xcite , due to a refined expression for the total cross section . from the values determined for the fractional energy loss , it is straightforward to compute the energy degradation of ehecrs in terms of their flight distance .",
    "[ jc ] +    in fig .",
    "1 we compare the energy attenuation length of nucleons obtained with the cel approximation and the monte carlo simulation taken from ref . @xcite .",
    "although the energy loss is dominated by single pion photoproduction @xcite , one can see that at higher energies the multiple production of pions becomes quite important .",
    "notice that , independently of the initial energy of the nucleon , the mean energy values approach to 100 eev after a distance of @xmath53 100 mpc .",
    "the relevant mechanisms for energy losses that extremely high energy nuclei suffer during their trip to the earth are photodisintegration and hadron photoproduction ( which has a threshold energy of @xmath54 mev , equivalent to a lorentz factor of @xmath55 , above the range treated in this thesis ) .    following the conventions of eq .",
    "( [ conventions ] ) , the disintegration rate of a nucleus of mass @xmath56 with the subsequent production of @xmath57 nucleons is given by the expression @xcite , @xmath58 with @xmath59 the cross section for the interaction .",
    "using the expressions for the cross section fitted by puget _",
    "@xcite , it is possible to work out an analytical solution for the nuclear disintegration rates @xcite . after adding over all the possible channels for a given number of nucleons , one obtains the effective nucleon loss rate .",
    "the effective @xmath60fe nucleon loss rate obtained after carrying out these straightforward but rather lengthy steps can be parametrized by , @xmath61 if @xmath62 $ ] , and @xmath63 if @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that knowledge of the iron effective nucleons loss rate alone is enough to obtain the corresponding value of @xmath65 for any other nuclei @xcite .",
    "the emission of nucleons is isotropic in the rest frame of the nucleus , and so the averaged fractional energy loss results equal the fractional loss in mass number of the nucleus , _ viz .",
    "_ , the lorentz factor is conserved .",
    "because of the position of @xmath60fe on the binding energy curve , it is considered to be a significant end product of stellar evolution , and higher mass nuclei are found to be much rarer in the cosmic radiation .",
    "thus , hereafter , when speaking of sources of heavy nuclei we shall be thinking on iron nuclei . the relation which determines the attenuation length for its energy is then , @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the energy with which the nuclei were emitted from the source , and @xmath68 .",
    "[ phdf3 ] +    [ phdf4 ] +    in figs . 2 and 3 we plot the final mass ( i.e. @xmath56 ) and energy @xmath69 of the heaviest surviving fragment as a function of the distance for initial iron nuclei ( a ) .",
    "for comparison , it is also super - imposed a monte carlo simulation which include the rates just discussed and also the pair creation processes ( b ) @xcite .",
    "one can see that nuclei with lorentz factors above @xmath70 can not survive for more than 10 mpc ( recall thet 10 mpc correspond to @xmath71 s ) , and for these distances , the cel approximation always lies in the region which includes 95% of the simulations .    at @xmath72",
    "the pair creation losses start to be relevant , significantly reducing the value of the lorentz factor as the nucleus propagates distances of @xmath73(100 mpc ) .",
    "the effect has a maximum for @xmath74 but becomes small again for @xmath75 , for which appreciable effects only appear for cosmological distances ( @xmath76 mpc ) , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the efect of neglecting pair creation losses translates into keeping @xmath77 constant during the propagation , and this enhances the photodisintegration rates and then reduces @xmath78 more rapidly . the divergences between ( b ) and ( c ) are less pronounced in fig .",
    "namely , for @xmath79 the average energies with and without pair creation proccess ( obtained with the monte carlo simulations ) are similar up to @xmath80 s while the @xmath78 values sizeably differ for @xmath81 s onwards .",
    "when comparing with the cel the differences arise even earlier ( @xmath53 70 mpc and 30 mpc respectively ) .",
    "this compensation is due to a partial cancellation between the effects of the evolution of @xmath25 and of @xmath56 in the values of the final energy ( @xmath82 ) , since neglecting pair creation losses does not allow @xmath25 to decrease but make instead @xmath56 to drop faster .",

    "4 we have shown the relation between the injection energy and the energy at a time @xmath83 for different propagation distances .",
    "the graph indicates that the final energy of the nucleus is not a monotonic function .",
    "it has a maximum at a critical energy and then decreases to a minimum before rising again as @xmath25 rises , as was first pointed out by puget _",
    "the fact that the energy @xmath69 is a multivaluated function of @xmath67 leads to a pile - up in the energy spectrum .",
    "moreover , this behaviour enhances a hidden feature of the energy spectrum for sources located beyond 2.6 mpc : a depression that preceeds a bump that would make the events at the end of the spectrum ( just before the cut - off ) around 50% more probable than those in the depressed region .",
    "let us begin with the modification that the mbr produces in the ehecr ( nucleon ) spectrum .",
    "the evolution of the spectrum is governed by the balance equation @xmath84 that takes into account the conservation of the total number of nucleons in the spectrum . in the first term on the right",
    ", @xmath85 is the mean rate at which particles lose energy .",
    "the second term , the diffusion in the mbr , is found to be extremely small due to the low density of relic photons and the fact that the average cosmic magnetic field is less than @xmath86 g @xcite and is neglected in the following .",
    "the third term corresponds to the particle injection rate into the intergalactic medium from some hypothetical source .",
    "since the origin of cosmic rays is still unknown , we consider three possible models : 1 ) the universal hypothesis , which assumes that cosmic rays come from no well - defined source , but rather are produced uniformly throughout space , 2 ) single point sources of cosmic rays , and 3 ) sources of finite size approximating clusters of galaxies . in all the cases",
    "it has been assumed that nucleons propagate in a straight line through the intergalactic medium due to the reasons mentioned above that allow us to neglect the diffusion term .",
    "there exists evidence that the source spectrum of cosmic rays has a power - law dependence @xmath87 ( see for instance @xcite ) . with the hypothesis that cosmic rays are produced from sources located uniformly in space , with this power law energy dependence ( which implies a steady state process ) , the solution of eq .",

    "it has been noted in the literature that the continuous energy loss approximation tends to overestimate the size of the bump @xcite .",
    "5 shows how the bump is less pronounced in our treatment .",
    "as the bump is a consequence of the sharp ( exponential ) dependence of the free path of the nucleon on energy , we attribute these differences to the replacement of a cross section approximated by the values at threshold energy @xcite , by a more detailed expression taking into account the main baryon resonances that turn out to be important .    another alternative for the particle injection comes from clusters of galaxies .",

    "for an iron source located at 3.5 mpc , the depression in the spectrum is almost invisible @xmath147 , in good agreement with the results previously obtained by elbert and sommers using monte carlo simulation @xcite .    the structure of the spectrum , recently published by agasa experiment ( fig .",
    "9 ) @xcite , seems to suggest the presence of a bump around @xmath148 ev ; the central points may be unvailing a second bump around @xmath149 ev .",
    "whatever the source of the highest energy crs , because of their interactions with the 2.7k relic radiation and magnetic fields in the universe , those reaching the earth will have spectra , composition and arrival directions affected by propagation . within the universal hypothesis , nucleons with energies above 100 eev are pushed below this limit , and as a consequence , particles which originally had a higher energy pile - up forming a bump around @xmath150 ev followed by a sharped cut - off . while the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays is still uncertain , it is not necessary to invoke top down mechanisms to explain the existing data .",
    "it seems likely that shock acceleration at fanaroff - riley radio galaxies , and starburst galaxies located around 3 mpc away ( recall that nucleus energy , for @xmath151 is degraded even faster than that of protons ) can account for the existing data at the end of the cr - spectrum ( energies above 100 eev ) .",
    "the existing experimental data are insufficient to draw any definitive conclusions , and we are obliged to present this idea as a hypothesis to be tested by experiment .",
    "radio galaxies considered as sources of cr beyond the gzk cut - off must be quite close to our own galaxy ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "there are just a few objects within this range and , consequently ( if these are responsable of the end of the cr - spectrum ) , the expected ehecr distribution on the sky should be highly anisotropic .",
    "assuming that the intergalactic magnetic field is near 1 ng , it should be expected an excess of cr detections at energies larger than @xmath153 ev within regions of angular radius @xmath154 and centered at the positions of the nearest active galaxies . according to this picture ,",
    "the southern cr - sky should be dominated by three outstanding sources : centaurus a ( the nearest radio galaxy ) which may provide the most energetic particles detectable on earth , pictor a ( a strong source with a flat radio spectrum ) which would contribute with the larger cr flux @xcite , and pks 1333 - 33 which might be a source of events similar to those recently detected in the northern hemisphere .",
    "in addition to these sources , there are other two southern candidates , fornax a ( @xmath155 ) and pks 2152 - 69 ( @xmath156 ) , which could provide contributions to the cr flux above the cut - off .",
    "an approximate theoretical picture of the up to now unexplored ultra high energy cr southern sky is consequently at our disposal . in this section",
    "we shall discuss the main features of the radio - galaxies cen a and pks 1333 - 33 . before doing so ,",
    "let us briefly summarize diffuse shock acceleration mechanisms .",
    "the hot spots of extended radio sources are regions of strong synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "these regions are produced when the bulk kinetic energy of the jets ejected by a central active source ( supermassive black hole + accretion disk ) is reconverted into relativistic particles and turbulent fields at a `` working surface '' in the head of the jets @xcite .",
    "the speed @xmath157 with which the head of a jet advances into the intergalactic medium of particle density @xmath158 can be obtained by balancing the momentum flux in the jet against the momentum flux of the surrounding medium .",
    "measured in the frame comoving with the advancing head , @xmath159^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the particle density and the velocity of the jet flow , respectively .",
    "clearly , @xmath162 for @xmath163 , in such a way that the jet will decelerate .",
    "the result is the formation of a strong collisionless shock , which is responsible for particle reacceleration and magnetic field amplification .",
    "the acceleration of particles up to ultrarelativistic energies in the hot spots is the result of repeated scattering back and forth across the shock front .",
    "the particle deflection in this mechanism is produced by alfvn waves in the turbulent magnetic field .",
    "this process has been studied in detail by biermann and strittmatter @xcite .",
    "assuming that the energy density per unit of wave number of mhd turbulence is of kolmogorov type , i.e. @xmath164 with @xmath165 , the acceleration time scale for protons given by : @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the jet velocity in units of @xmath168 , @xmath169 is the ratio of turbulent to ambient magnetic energy density in the hot spot ( of radius @xmath170 ) , and @xmath104 is the total magnetic field strength . the acceleration process will be efficient as long as the energy losses by synchrotron radiation and photon  proton interactions do not become dominant . considering an average cross section @xmath171 for the three dominant pion  producing interactions @xcite , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , we get the time scale of the energy losses within a certainty of 80% : @xmath175 where @xmath176 stands for the ratio of photon to magnetic energy densities , @xmath177 is the classical thomson cross section , and @xmath56 gives a measure of the relative strength of @xmath178 interactions against the synchrotron emission .",
    "biermann and strittmatter @xcite have estimated @xmath179 , almost independently of the source parameters .",
    "the most energetic protons injected in the intergalactic medium will have an energy that can be obtained by balancing the energy gains and losses : @xmath180 here @xmath181 is the magnetic field in units of @xmath182 g.    the diffusive shock acceleration process in the working surface leads to a power law particle spectrum @xcite , @xmath183 where @xmath184 for @xmath185 , and @xmath186 is the particle density in the source .      the most attractive features of centaurus a ( a complex and extremely powerful radio source identified at optical frequencies with the galaxy ngc 5128 ) as a possible source of crs are its active nature , its large , non - thermal radio lobes , and its proximity @xmath187 3.5 mpc . radio observations at different wavelengths @xcite show a structure composed by a compact core , a one  sided jet , double inner lobes , a northern middle lobe , and two giant outer lobes ( see fig . 10 ) .",
    "this morphology , together with the polarization data obtained by junkes _",
    "_ @xcite and the large  scale radio spectral index distribution @xcite , strongly support the picture of an active radio galaxy with a jet forming a relatively small angle ( @xmath188 ) with the line of sight .",
    "the jet would be responsible for the formation of the northern inner and middle lobes when interacting with the interstellar and intergalactic medium , respectively .",
    "the northern middle lobe can be interpreted as a `` working surface '' @xcite at the end of the jet , a place where strong shocks are produced by plasma collisions , i.e. it can be considered as the hot spot of a galaxy with a peculiar orientation .",

    "one can estimate @xmath192 from the radio spectral index of the synchrotron emission in the northern middle lobe and the observed degree of linear polarization in the same region .",
    "the size of the hot spot can be directly measured from the large  scale map obtained by junkes _",
    "@xcite with the assumed distance of 3.5 mpc , giving as a result @xmath193 kpc .",

    "the spectral index steepens in the jets , reaching @xmath211 , while the core has flatter values : @xmath212 .    an interesting feature of pks 1333 - 33 is an intense region of synchrotron emission localized at the outer edge of the eastern lobe .",

    "11 we have plotted the relation obtained for @xmath110 in the case of pks 1333 - 33 .",
    "the energy loss by photomeson production creates the expected cut - off , and the resulting ultra high energy crs ( protons and neutrons ) pile up just below the threshold energy of photopion production , forming a bump .",
    "however , the energies at which the cut - off and the bump appear seem to indicate that crs above 100 eev might be expected from the location in the sky of pks 1333 - 33 ( @xmath237 , @xmath238 ) .    whether this scenario is the correct one or not should be answered in a few years by the pierre auger southern observatory @xcite ( fluorescence detector plus ground array ) as well as by the future eyes of the owl @xcite that will deeply watch into the cr - sky .",
    "the energy spectrum beyond @xmath203 ev needs to be studied indirectly through the extensive air showers ( eas ) crs produce deep in the atmosphere .",
    "the interpretation of the observed cascades relies strongly on the model of the shower development used to simulate the transport of particles through the atmosphere .",
    "the parts of the shower model related to electromagnetic or weak interactions can be calculated with good accuracy .",
    "the hadronic interaction , however , is still subject to large uncertainties .",
    "it generally depends on monte carlo simulations which extrapolate phenomenological models to energies well beyond those explored at acellerators .",
    "there is a couple of quite elaborate models ( the dual parton model ( dpm ) @xcite and the quark gluon string ( qgs ) model @xcite ) that provide a complete phenomenological description of all facets of soft hadronic processes .",
    "these models , inspired on @xmath239 expansion of qcd are also supplemented with generally accepted theoretical principles like duality , unitarity , regge behavior and parton structure ( for technical details see @xcite ) . at higher energies",
    ", however , there is evidence of minijet production @xcite and correlation between multiplicity per event and transverse momentum per particle @xcite , suggesting that semihard qcd processes become important in high energy hadronic interactions .",
    "it is precisely the problem of a proper accounting for semihard processes the major source of uncertainty of extensive air showers event generators .",
    "two codes of hadronic interactions with similar underlying physical assumptions and algorithms tailored for efficient operation to the highest cosmic ray energies are sibyll @xcite and qgsjet @xcite . in these codes",
    ", the low @xmath240 interactions are modeling by the exchange of pomerons ( a hypothetical particle with well defined properties , whose precise nature in terms of quarks and gluons is not yet completely understood ) .",
    "regge singularities are used to determine the momentum distribution functions of the various sets of constituents , valence and sea quarks . in the interaction ,",
    "the hadrons exchange very soft gluons , simulated by the production of a single pair qcd strings and the subsequent fragmentation into colour neutral hadrons .",
    "in qgsjet these events also involve exchange of multiple pairs of soft strings .",
    "as mentioned above , the production of small jets is expected to dominate interactions in the c.m .",
    "energy above @xmath241 40 tev .",
    "the underlying idea behind sibyll is that the increase in the cross section is driven by the production of minijets @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution for obtaining @xmath242 jet pairs in a collision at energy @xmath40 is computed regarding elastic @xmath243 or @xmath244 scattering as a difractive shadow scattering associated with inelastic processes @xcite .",
    "the algorithms are tuned to reproduce the central and fragmentation regions data up to @xmath244 collider energies , and with no further adjustments they are extrapolated several orders of magnitude .    in qgsjet",
    "the theory is formulated entirely in terms of pomeron exchanges .",
    "the basic idea is to replace the soft pomeron by a so - called `` semihard pomeron '' , which is defined to be an ordinary soft pomeron with the middle piece replaced by a qcd parton ladder .",
    "thus , minijets will emerge as a part of the `` semihard pomeron '' , which is itself the controlling mechanism for the whole interaction .",
    "after performing the energy sharing among the soft and semihard pomerons , and also the sharing among the soft and hard pieces of the last one ; the number of charged particles in the partonic cascade is easily obtained generalizing the method of multiple production of hadrons as discussed in the qgs model ( soft pomeron showers ) @xcite .    both , sibyll and qgsjet describe particle production in hadron - nucleus collisions in a quite similar fashion .",
    "the high energy projectile undergoes a multiple scattering as formulated in glauber s approach @xcite , particle production comes again after the fragmentation of colorless parton - parton chains constructed from the quark content of the interacting hadrons . in cases with",
    "more than one wounded nucleon in the target , the extra strings are connected with sea - quarks in the projectile .",
    "this ensures that the inelasticity in hadron - nucleus collisions is not much larger than that corresponding to hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "a higher inelastic nuclear stopping power yields relatively rapid shower developments which are ruled out by @xmath245-nucleus data @xcite .",
    "the most direct way to analyze the differences between the models is to study the characteristic of the secondaries generated under similar conditions . for each hadronic code",
    "we generate sets of @xmath246 collisions in order to analyze the secondaries produced by sibyll and qgsjet in @xmath247 and @xmath248 ( @xmath56 represents a nucleus target of mass number @xmath249 ) at different projectile energies .",
    "short lived final state particles are forced to decay according with algorithms included in the sibyll and qgsjet packages .",
    "we have recorded the total number of secondaries ( baryons , mesons , and gammas ) , @xmath242 , produced as a result of the interactions . in all the considered cases we found that the number of secondaries coming from qgsjet collisions is larger than the ones corresponding to the sibyll case . for each particle type , two - dimension @xmath250",
    "log@xmath251 distributions were generated .",
    "figure 12 shows selected energy distributions for secondaries produced in @xmath245-@xmath252 collisions .",
    "it is easily seen that when the algorithms are extrapolated several orders of magnitude , the differences between the predicted number of secondaries grow up dramatically .",
    "proton induced air showers are generated using aires+sibyll and aires+qgsjet .",
    "primary energies range from @xmath253 ev up to @xmath254 ev . to put into evidence as much as possible the differences between the intrinsic mechanism of sibyll and qgsjet we have always used the same cross sections for hadronic collisions , namely , the aires cross section .",
    "all hadronic collisions with projectile energies below 200 gev are processed with the hillas splitting algorithm @xcite , and the external collision package is invoked for all those collisions with energies above the mentioned threshold .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that for ultra - high energy primaries , the low energy collisions represent a little fraction ( no more than 10% at @xmath254 ev ) of the total number of inelastic hadronic processes that take place during the shower development .",
    "it is also important to stress that the dependence of the shower observables on the hadronic model is primarily related to the first interactions which in all the cases are ultra high energy processes involving only the external hadronic models .",
    "all shower particles with energies above the following thresholds were tracked : 500 kev for gammas , 700 kev for electrons and positrons , 1 mev for muons , 1.5 mev for mesons and 80 mev for nucleons and nuclei .",
    "the particles were injected at the top of the atmosphere ( 100 km.a.s.l ) and the ground level was located at sea level .",
    "[ xmax ]    we have analyzed in detail the longitudinal development of the showers .",
    "the number of different kind of particles have been recorded as a function of the vertical depth for a number of different observing levels ( more than 100 ) .    the charged multiplicity , essentially electrons and positrons , is used to determine the number of particles and the location of the shower maximum by means of four - parameter fits to the gaisser - hillas function @xcite . in fig . 13 ,",
    "@xmath255 is plotted versus the logarithm of the primary energy for both , the sibyll and qgsjet cases .",
    "it shows up clearly that sibyll showers present higher values for the depth of the maximum , and that the differences between the sibyll and qgsjet cases increase with the primary energy .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that sibyll produces less secondaries than qgsjet as discussed before and as a result , there is a delay in the electromagnetic shower development which is strongly correlated with @xmath256 decays .",
    "the fluctuations , represented by the error bars , decrease monotonously as long as the energy increases , passing roughly from 95 g/@xmath257 at @xmath258 ev to 70 g/@xmath257 at @xmath259 ev .",
    "[ dmu ]    using the recorded particle data , we have evaluated lateral distributions not only at ground altitude but also at predetermined observing levels . in the figs .",
    "14 and 15 we present the distributions corresponding to a subset of all the levels considered , taking into account particles whose distances to the shower axis are larger than 50 m.    the high - altitude lateral distributions show important differences between sibyll and qgsjet ; such differences diminish as long as the shower front gets closer to the ground level .",
    "the behaviour can be explained taking into account the differences between the number of sibyll and qgsjet secondaries previously reported .",
    "due to the fact that sibyll produces less number of secondaries , they have in average more energy and therefore the number of generations of particles undergoing hadronic collisions is increased with respect to the qgsjet case . as a result , during the shower development sibyll is called more times than qgsjet , and this generates a compensation that tends to reduce the difference in the _ final _ number of hadronic secondaries produced during the entire shower , and consequently in the final decay products , that is , electrons , gammas and muons .",
    "the lateral distributions of electromagnetic particles are remarkably similar at both @xmath255 and ground level .",
    "is different in each model .",
    "] however , it comes out from a more detailed analysis of the ground distributions that they are not strictly coincident and that the ratio between sibyll and qgsjet predictions does depend on @xmath260 , the distance from the core .",
    "in fact , for electrons , this ratio runs from 1.25 for small @xmath260 to 0.73 for @xmath261 m , being equal to 1 at @xmath262 m. a similar behaviour is observed for gammas where the lateral distributions intersect at @xmath261 m. in the case of lateral muon distributions , qgsjet predicts a higher density for all distances , but the sibyll / qgsjet ratio is not constant , ranging from 0.74 near the core to 0.56 at 1000 m.    [ ga ]    summing up , the most oustanding difference between sibyll and qgsjet is reflected in the predicted number of secondaries after single @xmath245-@xmath252 and @xmath252-nuclei collisions .",
    "such a difference increase steeply with rising energy .",
    "the different number of secondaries predicted remains noticeable during the first stages of the shower development , however , the evolution of lateral distributions along the longitudinal shower path allows us to clearly observe how the differences in the distributions become monotonously damped , yielding rather similar shapes when reaching the ground .",
    "further , we have shown that the differences observed at ground level do depend on the distance to the shower core .",
    "consequently , we are convinced that it will be possible to obtain relevant information about the hadronic interactions in air showers from the measurement of particle densities at distances far from ( as well as close to ) the shower core .",
    "this can be achieved if cr experiments are designed with appropiate dynamic ranges .",
    "measurement of particle numbers at high atmospheric altitudes ( fluorence detectors ) together with shower maximun and changes rates , should contribute positively in the understanding of hadronic interactions if the kind of cosmic particle that induces the shower could be determined separately .",
    "finally , it should be noted that most of the model discrepancies in hadronic interactions will be naturally reduced with the help of data obtained from future accelerator experiments like the well known large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "cosmic rays of extremely high energy are a weird phenomenon of nature for which no truly satisfactory explanation has been found yet . this may simply reflect our present ignorance of conditions or processes in some highly energetic regions of the universe - or may imply that exotic mechanisms are at play .",
    "after thirty years of careful work by several groups all over the world , we are in possession of a tantalizing body of data , sufficient to raise our curiosity and wonder , but not to succeed unravelling in the mistery . the coming avalanche of high quality cr - observations promises to make the begining of the next millenium an extremely exciting period for cr - physics .",
