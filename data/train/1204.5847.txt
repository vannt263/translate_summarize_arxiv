    "microflares , or subflares , which are small - scale and short - lived solar activities , have already been studied for many years since last century  @xcite .",
    "the typical size , duration and total released energy are 520 arcsecs , 1030 minutes and @xmath4@xmath5 ergs @xcite , respectively .",
    "microflares have been observed in many wavelengthes including h@xmath3 @xcite , euv @xcite , soft x - ray @xcite , hard x - ray @xcite , and microwave @xcite .",
    "however , not all microflares have emissions at all wavelengths .",
    "observations show that most of bright x - ray microflares also appear at euv and h@xmath3 bands , but only part of h@xmath3 microflares have their counterparts in x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "observational characteristics of microflares , such as the heating , the relation with magnetic field , the duration and the coincidence between different wavelengths , etc , imply that microflares are produced by magnetic reconnection , similar to big flares .",
    "for example , @xcite found that about 40% of microflares show hard x - ray emissions at over 10 kev and microwave emissions at about 10 ghz , typical features for flares .",
    "recently , @xcite found that roughly half of the microflares display the neupert effect as previously revealed in flares . on the other hand",
    ", some other microflares may have their origins in the lower atmosphere .",
    "@xcite found that the microflares are bright in the chromospheric and transition region spectral lines , which is consistent with the chromospheric heating by nonthermal electron beams .",
    "@xcite concluded that the microflares in their study are due to magnetic reconnection at a height of 200 km above the solar surface .    since a part of the microflares are located at emerging flux regions , they are probably due to magnetic reconnection driven by the new emerging magnetic flux ( emf ) with a pre - existing magnetic field .",
    "@xcite found that the x - ray loops of microflares appear at the locations of emf .",
    "@xcite found some repeatedly occurred euv jets where the pre - existing magnetic field was  canceled \" by the new emf with opposite polarity .",
    "@xcite indicated that the new emf successfully emerged about 20 minutes before the peaks of h@xmath3 and soft x - ray brightenings .",
    "half of the events studied by @xcite show the small scale emergences of magnetic flux loops in the vicinity of the transient brightenings .",
    "@xcite found that emfs and moving magnetic features ( mmfs ) are related to the energy release for at least half of the microflares around a well developed sunspot .",
    "therefore , to understand the dynamics of microflares , it is crucial to simulate the magnetic reconnection associated with emf .",
    "the numerical simulations of flux emergence scenario started from 1980s @xcite . later , more realistic and complicated numerical experiments @xcite were presented to study the emergence of twisted flux from the convection region to solar corona .",
    "the simulations are mainly based on the parker instability which is proposed by @xcite and their results can be applied to account for the formation of filament or newly active region .",
    "more 2d and 3d numerical experiments are focused on the interaction between the emerging flux and the per - existing coronal magnetic configuration to study the solar eruptions . with 2d simulations",
    ", it is found that the magnetic reconnection due to flux emergence can well explain solar jets or explosive events @xcite , or can even trigger the onset of coronal mass ejections @xcite .",
    "further 3d simulations gave the same but more detailed results , which revealed that the emerging flux plays a key role in the formation of many solar activities , such as type ii spicules , erupting filaments or flux ropes , ellerman bombs , and so on @xcite .    from the description of previous works",
    ", it is seen that emf is responsible for many different phenomena , and one main cause of the diversity of the dynamics is that the reconnection happens at diffferent heights in the solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "our simulation in this paper is mainly focused on the microflares in a canopy - type magnetic configuration , where the height of the reconnection is self - consistently determined by the emf . in our previous papers @xcite , we presented the 2.5 dimensional ( 2.5d ) magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulation of magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere , which reproduces qualitatively the temperature enhancement observed in chromospheric microflares .",
    "however , the magnetic configuration in that simulation , the same as in @xcite , is too idealized and the reconnection site was specified at the computational center . besides , no corona was included , so that the simulations can tell nothing about the euv and sxr features . in this paper",
    ", we adopt a more realistic magnetic configuration and extend the solar atmosphere up to the corona in order to see what determines a microflare to be of coronal origin or of the chromospheric origin , and to compare the difference between the two types of microflares .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the numerical method is described in section [ numerical_method ] ; the numerical results are presented in section [ sec : numerical_results ] .",
    "discussion and summary are given in section [ sec : discussion_summary ] .",
    "how to keep the magnetic field divergence free is one of the big problems in all mhd codes . because of the discretization and numerical errors , the performance of the mhd code can be unphysical @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to maintain @xmath6 for mhd equations : ( 1 ) 8-wave formulation @xcite , ( 2 ) the ct method @xcite , ( 3 ) the projection scheme @xcite .",
    "the comparison between these methods showed that different methods have their own advantages and disadvantages @xcite . besides",
    ", one can rewrite the original mhd equations by using _",
    "vector potential @xmath7 instead of the magnetic field @xmath8 , or by using the vector magnetic potential or euler potential .",
    "the advantage is that the divergence free condition is always satisfied , however , the mhd equation should be rewritten .",
    "our method , as introduced in @xcite adopts the 8-wave method . as suggested by @xcite , we use the extended generalized lagrange multiplier ( eglm)-mhd equations rather than pure mhd equations , which include two additional waves to transfer the numerical error of @xmath9 . the local divergence error can be damped and passed out of the computational domain .",
    "the adopted dimensionless eglm - mhd equations with resistivity and gravity included are given as follows : _",
    "@xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    where eight independent conserved variables are the density ( @xmath15 ) , momentum ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , magnetic field ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , and total energy density ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "the expressions for @xmath31 and @xmath32 are :    @xmath33    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the time step , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the grid sizes , @xmath38 is a safety coefficient less than 1 .",
    "@xmath39 is a problem dependent coefficient to decide the damping rate for the waves of divergence errors .",
    "we can see that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are not independent of the grid resolution and the scheme used .",
    "hence we have to adjust their values for different situations .",
    "the computational box is located in the @xmath40-@xmath41 cartesian plane .",
    "the @xmath40-axis is parallel to the solar surface while the @xmath41-axis is perpendicular to the photosphere .",

    "given the temperature distribution we can get the density and pressure distributions according to the hydrostatic equilibrium .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig01 ] , two canopy - shaped magnetic structures are separated by a distance of 100 ( corresponding to 30 mm ) in order to mimic the two boundaries of a supergranular cell .",
    "the canopy magnetic field , which was originally proposed by @xcite and @xcite for studying the chromospheric and photospheric magnetic fields , is rooted at the supergranular boundaries . in order to create a canopy magnetic field",

[ fig02 ] ]      in order to reproduce a fast reconnection  @xcite , we adopt a non - uniform anomalous resistivity .",
    "this kind of resistivity may be due to some microscopic instabilities , although how these instabilities drive the macroscopic reconnection is still not clear .",
    "the mathematical form of the assumed anomalous resistivity model @xcite is :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the total current density , @xmath67 the threshold , above which the anomalous resistivity is excited , and @xmath68 the maximum value of the resistivity .",
    "as shown by equations ( [ equ : resistivity ] ) , the resistivity ( @xmath28 ) is dependent on the current density .",
    "the anomalous resistivity ( @xmath28 ) is switched off when @xmath69 .      the magnetic flux emergence is realized by changing conditions at the lower boundary @xcite . in our case ,",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 , rather than the magnetic flux function in previous works , are independent variables , we change directly the magnetic field value at the boundary .",
    "the magnetic field ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) changes with time while the other variables , e.g. , @xmath15 , @xmath73 , and @xmath25 , are fixed to the initial values at this boundary .",
    "the mathematic form of the emf is given by :    @xmath74    @xmath75    in the range @xmath76 , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the strength of the emf , @xmath79 the end time of emergence , @xmath80 the half width of the emf , @xmath81 and @xmath82 the center coordinates of the emf in @xmath40- and @xmath41-direction . in our simulation cases , @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    "are set to be @xmath54 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "formulae ( [ equ : emf01])([equ : emf02 ] ) are applied to the magnetic field @xmath8 until @xmath84 . later , all the physical values are fixed .",
    "free boundaries ( equivalent extrapolation ) are adopted at the upper side @xmath85 . however , because of the low plasma beta ( @xmath86 ) the upper boundary becomes unstable when the jets or waves propagate to this boundary .",
    "thus we add a damping zone from @xmath87 to @xmath85 in @xmath41-direction as shown in figure  [ fig01 ] .",
    "the waves or jets will be damped to the initial value as the formulae given below :    @xmath88    @xmath89    where @xmath90 represents varibles @xmath15 , @xmath73 , and @xmath25 ( not @xmath8 ) , @xmath91 is the initial value , @xmath92 the damping function , @xmath93 the start of position for the damping zone in @xmath41 direction , @xmath82 the end position for damping zone . in all our cases , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "nonetheless , the damping zone may also lead to some reflections of waves or jets , but these reflections have little effect on the results since they are far away from the lower atmosphere which we are interested in .",
    "we use fixed boundary condition for the left and right boundaries at @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the code used in our simulation is map @xcite , which is developed by the solar group of nanjing university .",
    "the map code is a fortran code for mhd calculation with the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) @xcite and message passing interface ( mpi ) parallelization .",
    "map have three optional numerical schemes for the mhd part , namely , modified mac cormack scheme @xcite , lax - fridrichs scheme @xcite and weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) @xcite scheme . in this paper",
    ", we mainly use the weno scheme , which has a higher accuracy than the other two .",
    "moreover , it can keep the total variation diminishing ( tvd ) @xcite property for the mhd part without any additional artificial viscosity .",
    "the base resolution of our simulation is @xmath98 and the mesh refinement level is @xmath99 in all of our cases .",
    "thus the effective resolution is @xmath100 globally and the minimum grid size is @xmath101 ( about @xmath102 km ) .",
    "our simulations show two typical cases , one with the reconnection occurring in the corona while the other mainly in the chromosphere and partly in transition region .",
    "the dynamics of magnetic reconnection processes is similar in the early stage in the two cases . both show the following evolution : ( 1 ) an emf emerges from the center of the supergranule ; ( 2 ) the emf reconnects with the pre - existed magnetic field ; ( 3 ) temperature is enhanced near the x - point and the reconnection inflow and outflow appear .",
    "however , the final results are very different .",
    "the difference between these two cases are presented in [ sec : corona_case ] and [ sec : chromosphere_case ] subsections .      in this case",
    ", we set the parameters of the emf to be @xmath103 ( corresponding to @xmath104 g ) , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( corresponding to @xmath107 km ) .",
    "the reconnection occurs when the local current density is larger than the threshold ( @xmath108 ) in the formula ( [ equ : resistivity ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig03 ] depicts the results of the simulation at different times . in this figure the color stands for the temperature , solid lines for magnetic field and arrows for velocity .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig03 ] shows that the emf already rose into the photosphere and chromosphere . at the time 55",
    ", the transition region has been pushed up to the height @xmath109 ( i.e. , about @xmath57 km ) , and fast reconnection has not happened yet .",
    "later , when the magnetic reconnection rate reaches the maximum ( time=@xmath110 , as shown by the upper left panel of figure [ fig04 ] ) , a large amount of magnetic energy is released to the internal energy and kinetic energy . in this case",
    ", the reconnection occurs at the corona and the size of this microflare is about 50 from @xmath111 to @xmath112 ( @xmath113 km , i.e. @xmath114 arcsec ) .",

    "the reconnection rate is calculated by the ratio of the inflow speed ( @xmath117 ) and the local alfvn speed ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "both two speeds are measured around the current sheet .",
    "the reconnection rate reaches the maximum around time=@xmath110 ( 38 minutes ) and its value is about 0.09 that is within the value of 0.01 - 0.1 predicted by @xcite .",
    "the high reconnection rate partly results from some small plasmoids ejections from the x - point , which may increase the reconnection rate @xcite . while after time=@xmath119",
    ", some numerical errors occur at the center of the emf .",
    "thus , the result after that time is unreliable although the reconnection rate increases again ( see the upper left panel of figure [ fig04 ] ) . a roughly estimated life time of this coronal microflare is about 12 minutes if we take the duration being from the beginning ( time=@xmath120 ) to the ending ( time=@xmath121 ) of the main reconnection .",

    "start time to the maximum time , a bigger emf can rise to a higher altitude .",
    "we know that in the higher altitude the plasma @xmath47 is lower , thus the magnetic reconnection can be very fast with the same resistivity . at the same time , the strength of the magnetic field of emf becomes weaker and weaker after expanding to such a long distance , so the temperature enhancement becomes smaller and smaller as indicated by figure [ fig07 ] .",
    "therefore , the left panel of figure [ fig09 ] shows the reconnection rate and the reconnection duration increase with the increasing half width of the emf . in the right panel",
    ", we find that the height of x - point is also sensitive to the size of the emf .",
    "combining the small magnetic strength of the emf , we can get the result of chromospheric microflare as described in section [ sec : chromosphere_case ] .",
    "in this paper , we simulate the microflares produced by emfs .",
    "the emfs with different strength and size lead to different results .",
    "two types of the microflares in our simulations , i.e. , of coronal origin and of chromospheric origin , can be illustrated by the cartoon in figure [ fig10 ] . according to our simulations , small microflares with weak doppler velocities and only h@xmath3 emissions",
    "are most likely due to the reconnection in the lower solar atmosphere ( for instance , the chromosphere or photosphere ) .",
    "however , big microflares with obvious doppler velocities and emissions in both low and high temperature wavelengthes ( h@xmath3 and euv / sxr ) originate from the reconnection in the corona .",
    "this model is similar to the unified model of @xcite and @xcite in the sense that the different behaviors of eruptions are determined by the different height of the magnetic reconnection . according to the result in this paper ,",
    "the strength and the size of the emf determines whether the microflare is of coronal origin or of chromospheric origin when the emf emerges from the center of a supergranule , probably dragged by the convective upflow . of course",
    ", emfs may also appear at other sites of a supergranule , which would also affect the height of the reconnection site .      as mentioned in section [ sec : corona_case ] , we find some plasmoids in our simulations .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] shows the current density distribution of a small region [ -35 , 0 ] @xmath143 [ 10 , 45 ] in figure [ fig03 ] . from both the temperature and current density distributions ( figure [ fig03 ] and [ fig11 ] )",
    ", we can see a plasmoid is formed at the center of the current sheet .",
    "the ejection of the plasmoid can increase the magnetic reconnection rate temporarily @xcite . in the reconnection process ,",
    "the plasmoids are generated one by one , therefore we can see some oscillations of the reconnection rate in figure [ fig04 ] . however , for the chromospheric case , the alfvn speed is much smaller than the coronal one , which leads to a smaller magnetic reynolds number .",
    "thus , similar to the results presented by @xcite , there is no plasmoid produced in the chromospheric case .",
    "the corresponding reconnection rate in figure [ fig06 ] also shows less oscillations . in the coronal case , as the reconnection occurs in the corona , both hot jets and cold surges are ejected . no doubt that the euv / sxr emissions from the hot jet will be observed first , whereas h@xmath3/ca bright points and surges appear later .",
    "if we take the temperature response at the height of 1500 km , which is the h@xmath3 formation height @xcite , the roughly calculated time delay between the euv / sxr and h@xmath3 emissions is about 35 minutes , which is comparable to the observations @xcite .",
    "we have to mention that the temperature enhancement and the time delay can be more realistic if we include the thermal conduction , radiation , the high energe particles ( non - thermal electrons and ions ) , and the effect of partially ionised plasma . for simplicity and for the sake to see how emerging flux with different sizes and strengths influencesthe reconnection , we kept the threshold of the current density @xmath67 in the anomalous resisitivity in eq .",
    "( [ equ : resistivity ] ) to be constant . in reality",
    ", the threshold of @xmath67 in the chromosphere might be higher because of its high plasma density . in order to see how @xmath67 would change the reconnection process",
    ", we performed other numerical experiments with higher @xmath67 in the chromosphere , and it is found that the basic results are the same , the main difference is that the commencement of reconnection is postponed only for the case that the current sheet located at the chromosphere , as demonstrated by @xcite .    -component current density ( jz ) distribution of the conoral case at the time 70 .",
    "the overall view of temperature distribution is shown by the bottom panel of figure [ fig03 ] at the same time .",
    "the range of this box is [ -35 , 0 ] @xmath143 [ 10 , 45 ] , in which a plasmoid in the center of the current sheet is clearly seen .",
    "[ fig11 ] ]    in summary , we successfully simulated the coronal and chromospheric microflares by using mhd simulations with a canopy - type magnteic configuration .",
    "the different observational behaviors between coronal microflares and chromospheric ones are due to the height of magnetic reconnection , which is determined by the size of the emerging flux , i.e. , smaller emerging flux produces chromospheric microflares and larger emerging flux produces coronal microflares .",
    "correspondingly , the resulting microflares have different sizes . in the case of coronal origin , the sizes of the simulated microflares are @xmath144 km , i.e. , @xmath145 , which correspond to big microflares .",
    "we find a hot jet ( @xmath0@xmath1 k for the typical case ) , which should be relates to the observational euv / sxr jet , and a cold jet ( @xmath0@xmath2 k for the typical case ) , which corresponds to the observational h@xmath3/ca surge or brightening .",
    "some plasmoids generated at the center of the current sheet are ejected , which can increase the magnetic reconnection rate . in the case of chromospheric origin , the sizes of the microflares are @xmath146 km , i.e. , @xmath06@xmath147 , which correspond to relatively small microflares . as the reconnection occurs in the chromosphere ,",
    "only the h@xmath3/ca brightenings show up in this case , where no significant sxr brightening and no plasmoids are produced in this case .",
    "the parameter survey qualitatively shows that the size and strength of the emf are the key parameters which determine the height of the reconnection x - point .",
    "for some typical values , we can get the reconnection either in the corona or in the chromosphere .",
    "the parameter @xmath68 has little effect on the final results .",
    "this paper deals with the microflares related to emfs .",
    "it should be mentioned that some microflares are due to other mechanisms , e.g. , the reconnection between the mmfs @xcite and the pre - existing magnetic field .",
    "@xcite proposed a canceling magnetic features model .",
    "@xcite performed 3d mhd simulations to study the role of kink instability in the magnetic energy releas process , which may also lead to microflares .",
    "it is also noticed that the simulated emerging flux in this paper does not include the twisted field , which is required for the emerging flux to survive the subsurface convection ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , e.g. , @xcite found that the tension force of twisted tube plays a key role in determining whether the flux can successfully emerge to the upper solar atmosphere in 3d numerical experiments . in the 2d coronal simulations ,",
    "the twisted field can be easily considered by including @xmath72 , which would not change the results greatly . moreover , a single - fluid model for the solar atmosphere was adopted in this paper for simplicity . in reality , the chromosphere , especially the lower part , is weakly - ionzed , and partial ionization should be considered , which would lead to strong anisotropic cowling resistivity @xcite , ambipolar diffusion @xcite . moreover",
    ", the ionization of neutral atoms would consume a significant part of the released energy in the magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
