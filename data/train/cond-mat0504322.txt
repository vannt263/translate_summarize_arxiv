    "[ fig : fig1 ] . ]    in region ( i ) , due to the large cyclotron radius ( almost vanishing curvature ) most trajectories have a single collision with the antidot .",
    "in fact , at very small fields , @xmath174 , there is practically no collision with the walls .",
    "the typical process consists of an incoming electron moving almost on a straight line hitting the antidot once , being converted into a hole which nearly retraces the electron path moving towards the left lead and finally leaving the device .",
    "therefore , @xmath73 in this region is larger than @xmath74 , @xmath77 and @xmath96 .",
    "there is however a significant amount of electrons emitted initially with a large enough angle , @xmath148 , which hit directly the upper or lower wall of the device suffering normal reflection and then exiting to the right lead .",
    "this process gives a finite electron transmission coefficient , yielding a significant contribution to @xmath77 .",
    "for even larger emission angles , there is a second but less significant set of trajectories that exhibit specular reflections at the walls 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "particles along these paths escape finally from the cavity through the left opening , overall leading to very small values of @xmath96 . with increasing @xmath0 ,",
    "the curvature of the trajectories also increases so that an additional collision with the wall takes place .",
    "the incoming electron hits again the antidot , becoming a hole and as the curvature is increased the hole can not escape from the narrow left lead , subsequently hitting wall 1 , being specularly reflected and leaving the device from the right lead . therefore , @xmath74 is increased at the cost of @xmath73 .    in region ( ii )",
    ", the curvature of the trajectories increases further .",
    "a typical trajectory for an incoming electron , after being andreev reflected at the antidot , hits the wall 4 and escapes to the left lead after specular reflection . as a result",
    "@xmath73 increases in this region .",
    "we also observe a decrease of @xmath77 owing to the increased curvature of the trajectories making it difficult for the incoming electrons to avoid the collision with the antidot and it is therefore harder to encounter the outgoing right lead . in region",
    "( iii ) , there is no significant variation of the observables @xmath175 and @xmath176 .    as the intermediate field regime defined by the linear decrease in @xmath98",
    "is approached , in ( iv ) we observe a sudden decrease of both @xmath74 and @xmath73 with a simultaneous increase of , predominantly , @xmath77 .",
    "although the measure @xmath123 of trajectories with several collisions with the antidot is non - zero , thereby , contributing to the chaotic part of the phase space , the predominant part of the trajectories do not experience andreev reflection . in the regime with @xmath177 , we encounter @xmath169 due to the fact the every trajectory has an even number of collisions with the antidot ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the predominant part of the orbits have 5 to 7 collisions with the walls 1,3 and 4 thereby hopping along the boundary of the square cavity .",
    "finally , the high - field region is characterized by @xmath169 , and @xmath137 as in the case of the normal antidot .",
    "performing simulations of the classical and quantum dynamics of low - energy quasiparticles , we showed that a purely classical analysis may be used as an interpretation tool for the average transport properties of generic normal and andreev billiards .",
    "in particular , the parametric dependence on the strength of a perpendicular magnetic field b was studied . as the strength increases",
    ", this dependence of the classical trajectories on the applied magnetic field drives the classical dynamics from mixed to regular for both types of billiards .",
    "the latter is grossly reflected in the non - monotonic behavior of the magnetoconductance at intermediate fields .",
    "owing to the increasing trajectory bending , a slight increase of the conductance @xmath178 at small fields of the normal billiard is followed by a significant valley whose minimum defines the passage to intermediate strengths .",
    "scattering of particles with the sinai - billiard disc starts reducing , also triggering the relative weight @xmath123 of the chaotic part of phase space to shrink .",
    "around @xmath104 , which corresponds to a cyclotron radius equal the disc radius , skipping orbits settle in and transport properties converge towards the high - b limit .    turning on the superconductivity at the sinai - billiard disc results in the interplay of the bending of the trajectories and the occurring particle - to - hole conversion .",
    "the magnetic field drives the integrable correlated motion of particles and holes into a mixed dynamics regime evident by an initial tendency of @xmath179 towards @xmath180 at small fields , typical for systems with phase space having a relative large chaotic part .",
    "compared to the normal case , increasing @xmath0 andreev reflection counteracts to the reduction of @xmath123 , which occurs eventually but at higher field strengths .",
    "hence , realizing the andreev billiard leads to qualitatively different behavior . rather than a magnetoconductance dip",
    ", we note a reentrance effect of the conductance towards its initial higher value .",
    "our classical calculations provide not only a qualitative rationalization of the observed properties of the exact quantum mechanical scattering coefficients and of the corresponding magnetoconductance spectrum but also allow us to make quantitative predictions , as evidenced by the remarkable agreement between the classical and quantum values .",
    "this is ideal for the designing of experimental setups and a simple analysis of the results , since classical simulations are much less time consuming .    in the present paper we studied the ( energy )",
    "averaged transport properties , i.e. , removing the quantum fluctuations .",
    "yet the averaged quantum results contain weak localization effects at zero and small magnetic fields .",
    "these quantum corrections to the averaged transmission are of order one ( more precisely -1/4 for chaotic ballistic systems ) compared to the classical contribution which is proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "more specifically , for the transmission per channel for the normal conducting sinai billiard with @xmath181 the negative quantum correction at zero field is expected to be below 0.1 , in line with the numerical results depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : trans_nc ] .",
    "it is indeed possible to extend the existing semiclassical theory for ballistic weak localization  @xcite to averaged quantum transport through andreev billiards  @xcite .",
    "however , our focus was on the finite @xmath0-field range where weak localization effects do not exist .",
    "rather , conductance fluctuations in this regime encode additional quantum information , and previous results in closed and open billiards ( either with a normal or a superconducting lead ) indicate that such fluctuations are interwined with the underlying classical properties .",
