    "there are at least two paradigms to address this issue beyond the usual entangled - separable distinction  @xcite .",

    "this has been firstly observed by ollivier and zurek and henderson and vedral , who derived the quantum discord as a signature of quantum correlations in bipartite systems  @xcite .",
    "the original definition of discord relies on the difference between two extensions of the classical mutual information to the quantum case .",
    "a generalization of discord using other entropic forms by a direct replacement of von neumman entropy  @xcite by general entropies , like rnyi  @xcite or tsallis  @xcite ones , as proposed in  @xcite , fails as it has been shown in  @xcite .    here",
    ", we aim to obtain quantum correlations measures by using general entropic forms , namely @xmath0-entropies ( or unified entropies )  @xcite . to avoid the difficulty discussed in  @xcite , we follow an alternative approach inspired by the work of luo  @xcite .",
    "we propose as quantum correlations measures the minimal change in unified entropies induced by a local rank - one measurement , divided by a factor that depends on the generalized purity only in the case of nonadditive entropies ( this adjusting factor becomes trivial for additive entropies ) .",
    "several quantum correlations measures discussed in the literature , like  @xcite , among others , are particular cases of ( or close to ) our proposal ( see  @xcite for a recent review of quantum correlations ) . indeed ,",
    "the case of trace form entropies  @xcite , which are nonadditive entropies ( except the von neumann case ) , has been dealt in  @xcite and deserves a particular mention .",
    "these entropic quantum correlations measures artificially increase when an uncorrelated ancilla is appended to the system ( the geometric discord  @xcite has the same issue , as it has been pointed out in  @xcite ) .",
    "the nonadditivity of trace form entropies is the cause of this problem .",
    "we solve this in the case of @xmath0-entropies by introducing a generalized purity factor , similarly to what has been done with the geometric discord , that is dividing it by the purity  @xcite . in this way",
    ", we obtain a family of @xmath0-entropic measures of quantum correlations that are invariant under the addition of an uncorrelated ancilla , both in the cases of additive and non - additive entropies .",

    "let us consider two density operators @xmath1 and @xmath21 , and the corresponding probability vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 formed by the eigenvalues of @xmath1 and @xmath21 , respectively , sorted in decreasing order .",
    "then , @xmath1 is majorized by @xmath21 , denoted as @xmath24 , means that @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denotes the rank of a density operator .",
    "notice that if @xmath28 we complete the vector @xmath22 with @xmath29 entries to have the same length of @xmath23 , and vice versa .",
    "this has no impact in the value of unified entropies due to the expansibility property .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath0-entropies preserve the majorization relation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , that is , @xmath30 with equality if and only if @xmath1 and @xmath21 have the same eigenvalues .",
    "we observe that the reciprocal does not hold in general , which means that majorization is stronger ( as an order relation ) than a single choice of the entropic indexes .    now , using the schur - concavity it is straightforward to show that @xmath0-entropies are lower and upper bounded : @xmath31 where the first inequality is attained for pure states , whereas the second one for the maximally mixed state @xmath32 .    on the other hand , it can be shown that the eigenvalues of a density operator @xmath1 are invariant under arbitrary unitary transformations @xmath33 , in other words @xmath1 and @xmath34 have the same eigenvalues .",
    "hence , we have that @xmath0-entropies are invariant under unitary transformations @xmath35 moreover , we will see in the next subsection that the change of in entropy due to local measurements plays a key role in order to quantify quantum correlations . before that",
    ", we recall the action of any bistochastic map over an arbitrary state . a bistochastic ( or completely positive , trace - preserving unital ) map @xmath36",
    "can be written in the kraus form as @xmath37 with both sets of positive operators @xmath38 ( completely positive ) and @xmath39 ( unital ) summing the identity ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "notice that this map leaves invariant the maximally mixed state ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath41 if and only if @xmath36 is a bistochastic map  @xcite , in other words for bistochastic maps the final state @xmath42 is more disordered ( in terms of majorization ) than the initial state @xmath1 . as a consequence of   and the schur - concavity of the @xmath0-entropies , we have @xmath43 where the equality is attained if and only if @xmath44 .",
    "hereafter , we are only interested in rank - one projective measurements without postselection , that is , a set orthogonal rank - one projectors @xmath45 , ( i.e. , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) with @xmath48 an orthonormal basis of @xmath3 . the state after a rank - one projective measurement @xmath49 is equal to @xmath50 with @xmath51 . as projective measurements",
    "are particular cases of bistochastic maps , we have also an inequality similar to   for @xmath49 .",
    "thus , we propose to use the difference of @xmath0-entropies between the final and initial states ( rescaled by a factor depending of the generalized purity ) as a signature of the disturbance of the state of a system due to the measurement , that is @xmath52 for any choice of the entropic indexes this quantity is nonnegative and vanishes if only if the measurement does not disturb the state ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) , which happens when measuring in the basis that diagonalises @xmath1 .",
    "notice that the rescaling factor plays no role for von neumann and rnyi entropies ( additive entropies ) , on the contrary it does for nonadditive entropies .",
    "in the next subsection , we will clarify the importance of the rescaling @xmath54 when dealing with quantum correlations measures based on nonadditive entropies .",
    "finally , notice that two interesting cases arise from the definition  .",
    "the first one consists in considering the von neumann entropy , in this case the disturbance can be recast as the quantum relative entropy ( or quantum kullback - leibler divergence ) between @xmath1 and @xmath55 , that is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the quantum relative entropy .",
    "the second one comes from evaluating   at tsallis entropy with entropic index equal to @xmath58 , for which the disturbance expresses in terms of the hilbert - schmidt distance between @xmath1 and @xmath55 divided by the purity of @xmath1 , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the hilbert - schmidt norm .",
    "let us consider a bipartite quantum system @xmath61 with density operator @xmath62 acting on a product finite dimensional hilbert space , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 . following  @xcite , we consider the local rank - one projective measurements ( without postselection ) , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are set of orthogonal rank - one projectors that sum to the identity , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "then , the resulting states after these measurements are @xmath72 \\pi^b(\\rho^{ab } ) & = \\sum_{j } i^a \\otimes p^b_j \\ \\rho^{ab } i^a \\otimes p^b_j = \\sum_{j } p^b_j \\rho^{a\\mid j } \\otimes p^b_j , \\label{eq : qcs}\\\\[2 mm ] \\pi^{ab}(\\rho^{ab } ) & = \\pi^a\\circ\\pi^b(\\rho^{ab } ) = \\pi^b\\circ\\pi^a(\\rho^{ab } ) \\nonumber \\\\[2 mm ] & = \\sum_{ij } p^a_i \\otimes p^b_j \\ \\rho^{ab } p^a_i \\otimes p^b_j = \\sum_{ij } p^{ab}_{ij } p^a_i \\otimes p^b_j , \\label{eq : ccs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 with @xmath74 , @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 . according to  @xcite",
    ", these states are called classical - quantum ( cq ) , quantum - classical ( qc ) and classical - classical ( cc ) correlated states with respect to the local measurements @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "a state is said cq correlated if there is a local projective measurement over @xmath81 that does not disturb it , i.e. , @xmath82 ( analogously for qc and cc correlated states ) .",
    "all these states are separable ( i.e. , nonentangled ) , as they are convex combinations of product states  @xcite , although not all separable states are of the forms  . moreover , the sets formed by all cq , qc and cc correlated states , denoted as @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , are not convex in contrast to the set of separable states .",
    "notice that @xmath86 and @xmath84 are the sets of zero quantum discord states with respect to @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively , and @xmath89  @xcite . in the sequel , for sake of brevity , we will use @xmath90 to denote either @xmath81 or @xmath91 , and @xmath92 to denote @xmath81 , @xmath91 or @xmath61 .",
    "now , we can use   to quantify the disturbance due to the local projective measurement @xmath93 , @xmath94 we denote @xmath95 as unilocal disturbances , whereas @xmath96 as bilocal disturbances .    in order to obtain a measurement - independent signature of quantum correlations",
    ", one takes the minimum of the disturbances   over the set of local measurements , that is @xmath97 the following properties justify our proposal   as measures of quantum correlations :    a.   nonnegativity : @xmath98 with equality if and only if @xmath99 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath100 are semiquantum correlations measures ( with respect to @xmath101 ) , whereas @xmath102 are total quantum correlation measures ; b.   invariance under local unitary operators : @xmath103 , where @xmath33 and @xmath104 are a unitary operations over @xmath81 and @xmath91 respectively ; and c.   invariance when an uncorrelated ancilla is appended to the system : @xmath105 for bipartitions @xmath106 or @xmath107 ( for the bipartition @xmath108 the quantum correlations measures naturally vanish ) .",
    "the first property is a direct consequence of majorization relation between the states after and before local projective measurements .",
    "the second one can be proved from the definition of our measure , eq .  , noting that @xmath109 , with @xmath110 , and recalling the invariance of @xmath0-entropies under unitary transformations .",
    "the third property is more subtle and it is related to the sum rule   of the @xmath0-entropies .",
    "indeed , the generalized purity factor @xmath111 plays a crucial role to fulfill this property in the case of nonadditive entropies , without affecting the complexity of computability of the measures . in general , this property has not been taking into account in the literature of nonadditive entropic measures of quantum correlations .",
    "for instance , entropic quantum correlations measures based on the difference of trace form entropies - entropies reduce to a trace form only if @xmath8 ( tsallis entropies ) . ] , i.e. , @xmath112 with @xmath113 concave and @xmath114  @xcite , have been dealt in refs .",
    ". however , these measures are not invariant when an uncorrelated ancilla is appended to the system , except for the von neumann case .",
    "this is direct consequence of nonadditivity of trace form entropies . for a more general discussion about necessary and reasonable conditions of quantum correlations measures ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "moreover , our semiquantum correlations measures can be also interpreted as a quantum deviation from the bayes rule in a way similar to that discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we remark that our quantum correlations measures include some important cases already discussed in the literature .",
    "the first one consists in evaluating   for the von neumann entropy . in this case",
    "we reobtain the so - called information deficit  @xcite , which can be rewritten in terms of the minimal relative entropy over the sets @xmath115  @xcite , @xmath116 the second one arises when evaluating   for the tsallis entropy with entropic index equal to @xmath58 .",
    "this case is close to the geometric discord  @xcite , @xmath117 indeed , using the expression of @xmath118 in terms of local projective measurements given in  @xcite , we obtain @xmath119 notice that @xmath120 is not invariant when an uncorrelated ancilla is appended to the system  @xcite .",
    "the purity rescaled factor solves this issue  @xcite , although there is not the unique way to do it ( see e.g  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , notice that in the case of rnyi entropies , which has recently been introduce in  @xcite , our measure fulfills the desired invariance property when appending an uncorrelated ancilla to the system .",
    "first , let us note that since qc , cq and cc correlated states   are separable , they fulfill some general entropic separability inequalities ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , @xmath121 on the other hand , the corresponding final reduced states are @xmath122 where @xmath123 denotes the diagonal of @xmath124 in the basis underlying by @xmath125 . since @xmath126  @xcite and due to the schur - concavity of the @xmath0-entropies , inequality   reduces to @xmath127 thus , plugging   into   to lowerbound @xmath128 and taking the minimum , we obtain that the quantum correlations measures are lower bounded , as follows @xmath129 notice that this lower bound could be nontrivial only for entangled sates ; indeed , the right hand side of   is negative for separable states . a similar result has already been obtained in the case of trace form entropies  @xcite .",
    "now , let us consider a pure state @xmath130 .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath131 is the schmidt decomposition of @xmath132 ( @xmath133 and @xmath134 are a orthonormal set ) .",
    "thus , it can be shown that the reduced states @xmath135 and @xmath136 have the same unified entropy and , as a consequence , the lower bound   reduces to @xmath137 for pure states @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , this bound is saturated when the local measurements are taking in the schmidt basis .",
    "after these measurements , i.e. , choosing the local projectors as @xmath138 ( completed to obtain @xmath139 projector ) , the state is given by @xmath140 , with unified entropies @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , we obtain that for pure states the entropic quantum correlations measures becomes a generalization of the entanglement entropy , @xmath142 which for the von neumann entropy reduces to the standard one  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to find some interesting relationships between total and semiquantum correlations when bilocal disturbances , @xmath143 , are rewritten in terms of unilocal disturbances , @xmath144 where @xmath145 ( for sake of brevity , we omit the dependence of this factor on the state ) .",
    "this quantity , @xmath146 , is nonnegative but it can take values below or above @xmath147 , depending on the value of the entropic parameter @xmath23 . as @xmath148 , we have that @xmath149 if @xmath150 , whereas , @xmath151 holds if @xmath152 . thus , @xmath153 $ ] if @xmath150 , else @xmath154 . in particular , for rnyi entropies",
    "the factor is always equal to @xmath147 .",
    "now , let us consider two possible measurement scenarios :    * @xmath155 is a bilocal measurement that minimizes the total quantum correlation measure , i.e. , @xmath156 , * @xmath157 , where @xmath158 , optimize the unilocal disturbances , i.e. , @xmath159 .    applying eqs .",
    " to both scenarios , we obtain @xmath160 and @xmath161 using that @xmath162 ( and the analogous relations for the unilocal disturbances ) on eqs .",
    " respectively , it can been shown that @xmath163 is lower and upper bounded as follows , @xmath164 in particular , given that the nonoptimal unilocal disturbances in   are nonnegative , we naturally obtain that total quantum correlation are greater than or equal to the semiquantum ones , @xmath165 this result can be also obtained more directly from the fact that @xmath166 .",
    "notice that   is in accordance with the inclusion relations among the sets of cq , qc and cc correlated states , i.e. , @xmath167 .",
    "moreover , noting that @xmath168 we can deduce from eqs .",
    " the following inequality for the sum of semiquantum correlations : @xmath169 where we defined the quantities @xmath170 , with @xmath171 .",
    "notice that for cq and qc correlated states , one has @xmath172 , @xmath173 being defined by the set @xmath174 so that it does not disturb the joint state . finally ,",
    "notice that for cc correlated states , all quantities in   vanish .",
    "therefore , from these observations together with  , we obtain    * if @xmath175 , then @xmath176 , * if @xmath177 , then @xmath178 , * if @xmath179 , then @xmath180 .    furthermore , a triangle - like inequality between total and semiquantum correlations , @xmath181 is trivially satisfied for cq , qc and cc correlated states .",
    "the validity of the triangle - like inequality   in the general case relies on the sign of @xmath182 . if @xmath183 , the inequality is generally true . on the contrary , if @xmath184 for some @xmath62 then it could be the case that the inequality does not hold for those states .",
    "although the most general conditions for the validity of the triangle - like inequality   are hard to analyze , we can link the validity of   with a kind of local contractivity property of the unilocal disturbances .",
    "specifically , let us assume as valid the following inequalities : @xmath185 then , we have @xmath186 and , replacing any of these relations in  , we obtain @xmath187 finally , recalling that @xmath188 , it follows the triangle - like inequality  .    thus , we are able to link the validity of the triangle - like inequality , for all states and any entropic indexes , with the assumption of contractivity of unilocal disturbances under local projective measurements . in the case of von neumman entropy ,",
    "inequalities   are particular cases of the contractivity of the quantum relative entropy under trace - preserving completely positive maps  @xcite .",
    "otherwise , for tsallis entropy of entropic index @xmath58 , inequalities   are particular cases of the contractivity of the hilbert - schmidt distance under projective measurements  @xcite . therefore , in both cases the triangle - like inequality is satisfied ( notice that for the latter , this result has been proved in alternative way  @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the local contractivity is not valid for general entropic functionals .",
    "indeed , we show that is the case for a wide range of the entropic index of the rnyi and tsallis entropies in fig .  [",
    "fig : contractivity ] .",
    "and @xmath189 computed for @xmath190 random local projective measurements @xmath191 , using tsallis entropies ( left figure ) and rnyi entropies ( right figure ) .",
    "each line corresponds to a random two - qubit state .",
    "notice that a wide range of values of the parametric index , @xmath23 , yields negative values for these differences , implying a violation of the contractivity property under local projective measurements ( see relations   and text for details ) . for @xmath19",
    "both measures converge to the von neumann - based one , which fulfills the contractivity property .",
    "the same happens for tsallis with @xmath10 , corresponding to the hilbert - schmidt distance .",
    "interestingly , in the tsallis case we have been unable to find a counterexample to the mentioned contractivity for @xmath192 ( shaded region of the left figure ) . ]",
    "an interesting example where the computations can be carried out analytically involves the family of _ pseudopure _ states , given by mixtures of an arbitrary pure state , @xmath193 , with the maximally mixed state , yielding @xmath194 with @xmath195 ( remind that @xmath196 ) .",

    ", we only proof this for the von neumann and tsallis with entropic index of order @xmath58 , which follows from the contractivity property under a projective measurement of quantum relative entropy and hilbert schmidt distance , respectively .",
    "we provide numerical counterexamples where the local contractivity property of unilocal disturbances fails in a wide range of the entropic index of rnyi and tsallis entropies , but it remains open if the triangle - like inequality is fulfilled for other entropic measures .    finally , we provide analytical expressions of the entropic correlations measures for pseudopure , werner and isotropic states . for these families of states ,",

    "<S> we introduce quantum correlations measures based on the minimal change in unified entropies induced by local rank - one projective measurements , divided by a factor that depends on the generalized purity of the system in the case of non - additive entropies . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we overcome the issue of the artificial increasing of the value of quantum correlations measures based on non - additive entropies when an uncorrelated ancilla is appended to the system , without changing the computability of our entropic correlations measures with respect to the previous ones . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we recover as limiting cases the quantum correlations measures based on von neumann and rnyi entropies ( i.e. , additive entropies ) , for which the adjustment factor becomes trivial . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we distinguish between total and semiquantum correlations and obtain some relations between them . finally , we obtain analytical expressions of the entropic correlations measures for typical quantum bipartite systems . </S>"
