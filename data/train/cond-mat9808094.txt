    "as described above we vary the average @xmath86 parameter in the range from 2 to 6 ev . for computational simplicity",
    "a relatively high temperature value @xmath97 k was used . note that the temperature in this approach is defined in terms of matsubara frequencies .",
    "in contrast to the standard lda calculations at the finite temperatures @xcite we take into account the temperature dependence of the bose degrees of freedoms through the p - h susceptibilities .",
    "it is known @xcite that this source of temperature dependence is the most important for itinerant electron magnets .",
    "although t is above t@xmath98 ( where t@xmath99 k is the experimental value of the curie temperature of iron ) all dos ( @xmath100 ) curves in the fig.1 show the spin splitting . in principle",
    ", one could calculate t@xmath101 using the temperature dependence of the uniform spin susceptibility @xcite but we have not done it yet .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that this splitting in dmft is a manifestation of the existence of local magnetic moment above @xmath102 and is not connected with long - range magnetic order .",
    "this spin splitting is a characteristic feature of local approximations and reflects the hubbard splitting in the one - band model @xcite .",
    "the local spin splitting above curie temperature in iron is definitely observed in many experiments , e.g. optics , photoemission etc .",
    "( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "first of all , we see that the value of the total magnetic moment is weakly dependent on @xmath86 and is of order of @xmath103 for this temperature .",
    "the positions of the main peaks with respect to the fermi energy roughly coincides with those in lsda up to @xmath104 ev .",
    "starting from @xmath105  ev satellites at @xmath106 ev appears as well as additional many - body structure at @xmath107  ev . note that a weak satellite - like feature at @xmath108 ev was observed experimentally in @xcite although it was not found in @xcite . for @xmath109 ev which is considered to be `` experimental '' value for iron @xcite there are no any noticeable manifestations of this satellite .",
    "the boundary values of @xmath86 of order of 2 ev with weak shoulder probably corresponds to the experimental situation in the best way . for @xmath110 ev an essential part of the spectral density related to the many - particle peaks corresponding to the upper and lower hubbard bands , which is unrealistic for such moderately correlated substances as iron . at @xmath111 ev the empty quasiparticle minority - spin peak goes below the fermi level which decreases the magnetic moment .    the depolarization of states near the fermi level is another important correlation effect .",
    "the decrease of the ratio @xmath112 /\\left [ n_{\\uparrow } \\left ( e_f\\right ) + n_{\\downarrow } \\left ( e_f\\right ) \\right ] $ ] is a typical sign of spin - polaron effects @xcite . in our approach",
    "this effects are taken into account through the @xmath113 terms in the effective spin - polarized lda++ potential .",
    "the energy dependence of self - energy in fig.2 shows characteristic features of moderately correlated systems . at low energies",
    "@xmath114 ev we see a typical fermi - liquid behavior @xmath115 @xmath116 at the same time , for the states beyond this interval within the @xmath27-bands the damping is rather large ( of the order of 1 ev ) so these states corresponds to ill - defined quasiparticles , especially for occupied states .",
    "this is probably one of the most important conclusions of our calculations .",
    "qualitatively it was already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of a model second - order perturbation theory calculations .",
    "we have shown that this is the case of realistic quasiparticle structure of iron with the reasonable value of coulomb interaction parameter .",
    "due to noticeable broadening of quasiparticle states the description of the computational results in terms of effective band structure ( determined , for example , from the maximum of spectral density ) would be incomplete .",
    "we present on the fig.3 the _ full _ spectral density @xmath117 including both coherent and incoherent parts as a function of @xmath95 and @xmath118 .",
    "we see that in general the maxima of the spectral density ( dark regions ) coincide with the experimentally obtained band structure .",
    "however , for occupied majority spin states at about -3 ev the distribution of the spectral density is rather broad and the description of this states in terms of the quasiparticle dispersion is problematic .",
    "this conclusion is in complete quantitative agreement with raw experimental data on angle - resolved spin - polarized photoemission @xcite with the broad non - dispersive second peak in the spin - up spectral function around -3 ev .",
    "one of the most unexpected results concerning electronic structure of iron was obtained by spin - polarized thermoemission for cesiated iron@xcite . in this case",
    "the thermal current is determined by the states with the energy @xmath119 ev above fermi level which are in the region of quasiparticle dos peak for minority spin .",
    "one could expect a strong negative spin polarization of the current ( polarization ratio p as estimated from lsda dos is about -85% ) .",
    "more accurate estimation which takes into account group velocities @xcite results in p= -34% for the polarization ratio .",
    "experimentally it found to be zero within the experimental error .",
    "to clarify the situation , we considered this effect on the basis of our lda++ calculations .",
    "the current through the surface @xmath120 in the spectral representation is    @xmath121 = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}}tr_{l\\sigma } \\left\\ { \\frac{\\partial t\\left ( \\mathbf{k}\\right ) } { \\partial k_x}\\left [ \\int\\limits_{-\\infty } ^\\infty def(e)a({\\mathbf k } , e)\\right ] \\right\\ }   \\label{therm1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath122 is the group velocity operator ( the matrix in orbital indices ) , @xmath123 is the fermi distribution function . taking into account only electrons moving towards the surface @xmath124 and with the energy ( e ) above the barrier ( w ) the thermoemission current ( cf .",
    "ref@xcite for the case of noninteracting electrons ) could be expressed as :    @xmath125    taking into account that @xmath126 and averaging over the surface orientations ( experiments @xcite were carried out for polycrystalline samples ) , we found the following approximate formula for the polarization    @xmath127    this was calculated using numerical differentiation of @xmath128 matrix and summing up over 1661 @xmath95 points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone .",
    "we obtained @xmath129 - 12% which is to compare with the value of @xmath130 from lsda calculations @xcite .",
    "the decrease of p is not a pure effect of damping of the quasiparticle states , but is the result of rather complicated cancellations of @xmath83 -electron contributions .",
    "therefore , one may conclude that there is no drastic discrepancy between experimental results @xcite and theoretical description of the electronic structure of iron , inspite of the approximate character of our treatment of the thermoemission problem .",
    "for more accurate description one needs to consider , for example , an influence of the cesium layer and surface effects on the electronic structure of iron according to the experimental conditions .",
    "we have proposed a general scheme for investigation of the correlation effects in the quasiparticle band structure calculations for itinerant - electron magnets .",
    "this approach is based on the combination of the dynamical mean - field theory and the fluctuating exchange approximation .",
    "application of lda++ method gives an adequate description of the quasiparticle electronic structure for ferromagnetic iron .",
    "the main correlation effects in the electron energy spectrum are strong damping of the occupied states below 1 ev from the fermi level @xmath131 and essential depolarization of the states in the vicinity of @xmath131 .",
    "we obtained a reasonable agreement with different experimental spectral data ( spin - polarized photo- and thermoemission ) .",
    "the method is rather universal and can be applied for other magnetic systems , both ferro- and antiferromagnets .",
