    "this underscores that the expansion has the potential to yield analytic approximations for the dynamics of many different master equations . at the same time , it opens up a new way for the efficient numerical solution of open quantum dynamics , which is in some sense complementary to the quantum trajectory approach .",

    "casting the weights of the jump terms into an @xmath46-dependent form , the convergence of the series can be optimized for a suitable choice @xmath89 . since the latter is conditioned on the complete information about all previous jumps , its implementation amounts to an adaptive , optimally convergent resummation of the jump expansion .",

    "this minimality is a defining property of the so - called pointer states @xcite , _",
    "i.e.  _ the basis states distinguished by the open quantum dynamics . in accord with empirical observations , we showed that the jump rates in the optimal resummation are particularly low or can even vanish altogether if the jump operators define a preferred ( pointer ) basis . in view of the fact that the pointer states of most realistic open systems exhibit small but non - vanishing jump rates ,",
    "the mixed state terms of the resummed jump expansion may reveal new aspects about the quantum - to - classical transition not captured by current methods based on pure state quantum trajectories @xcite .    in the second part",
    ", the optimally resummed jump expansion was implemented numerically for a number of well - known master equations .",
    "we discussed how to compute the jump terms straightforwardly by means of classical monte carlo integration with importance sampling , and we found convergence within the lowest orders , irrespective of the formal differences of the studied master equations ( single vs.  continuous set of jump operators , hermitian vs.  non - hermitian jump operators , finite vs.  infinite dimensional hilbert space ) .",
    "the fact that high convergence was observed in all cases underscores that the resummation method has the potential to yield analytic approximations for a wide class of open quantum problems , extending beyond the examples discussed in ref .",
    "it also implies a viable method for the efficient numerical simulation of master equations , which works by maximally biasing the weights of the constituent terms and then computing them successively , starting from the most important one .",
    "it thus complements the standard quantum trajectory approach , which approximates the overall mixed state by a single indiscriminate sum of pure states .",
    "since the method advances our abilities on both the analytical and the numerical side , it may well become a versatile tool for the study of markovian open systems .",
    "offering a new perspective on the fundamental difference between quantum and classical dynamics , it may lead to analytical models of open dynamics which are relevant for tasks such as incoherent quantum control .",

    "<S> , we present a detailed derivation of the underlying non - perturbative jump expansion , which involves an adaptive resummation to ensure optimal convergence . applying this to a set of exemplary master equations , we find that the resummation typically leads to convergence within the lowest two to five orders . </S>",
    "<S> besides facilitating analytic approximations , the optimal jump expansion thus provides a numerical scheme for the efficient simulation of open quantum systems .    </S>",
