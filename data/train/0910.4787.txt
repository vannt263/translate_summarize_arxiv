    "recently , many new resonances are discoveried experimentally . many of them have the proper quantum numbers of the @xmath3 meson states .",
    "however , their mass values do not fit the conventional @xmath3 states in the quark model . among them , @xmath0 was first observed in the @xmath4 channel by belle collaboration in 2003 @xcite , and has been confirmed by cdf @xcite , d0 @xcite and babar collaborations @xcite .",
    "its quantum numbers are probabely @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding charmonium candidates in the quark model are @xmath6 and @xmath7 which are @xmath8 mev above @xmath9 mev .",
    "many people suggested that @xmath0 is mainly a @xmath10 molecular state @xcite .",
    "however , to bind the quarks and anti - quarks together in such a four quark state or other multi - quark states , we need to introduce new interaction into the quark model .",
    "swanson proposed that the @xmath0 is mainly a @xmath10 molecule bound by the meson - meson interaction derived from the one pion exchange and the quark exchange @xcite . in wong s work",
    "@xcite , the meson - meson interaction is derived from a qed - type effective interaction in terms of effective charges for quarks and antiquarks . in refs .",
    "@xcite , further investigations based on the molecule assumption were carried out .",
    "since the strength of the one pion exchange interaction seems not strong enough to bind the @xmath10 molecular state , other authors argued that @xmath0 may be a dominant @xmath1 charmonium with some admixture of @xmath10 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , after taking into account of the sigma meson exchange potential , the interpretation of @xmath0 as a loosely bound molecular state was further disfavored .",
    "we should notice that the color structure of a multi - quark state is much richer than that of a @xmath3 conventional meson state .",
    "unlike the conventional mesons or baryons , the @xmath3 and @xmath11 pairs in a multi - quark state can be in the color @xmath12 and @xmath13 representations respectively .",
    "some color interactions which have no effects in the @xmath3 or @xmath14 colorless system , may have significant contribution in a multi - quark system .",
    "so the complete interactions in the quark model can be quite different after we take into account of these multi - quark states .",
    "the @xmath2-channel one gluon exchange interaction is an interaction between quark and anti - quark of the same flavor which annihilate into a virtual gluon .",
    "it has no effect on the conventional @xmath3 mesons but acts in the hidden flavor multi - quark system like the charmonium - like moelcular states . in this work",
    ", we will investigate the hidden flavor molecular states by considering the @xmath2-channel gluon exchange interaction in the quark model .",
    "in the next section , we will model the potential of the @xmath2-channel one gluon exchange interaction starting from the non - relativistic reduction .",
    "then the @xmath15 quantum numbers of the molecular states are selected by an analysis of the spin dependence of the interaction strength . in sec .",
    "[ sect-3 ] , we will carry out the numerical calculation of @xmath0 and some other charmonium - like states as the molecular states .",
    "also we will make prediction about the similar bottomium - like molecular states .",
    "finally , we will give a brief summary .",
    "in our work , we will use the bhaduri quark model which is a rather simple non - relativistic quark potential model . in the bhaduri model , the hamiltonian can be written as@xcite @xmath17 @xmath18 are constituent quark masses and @xmath19 are the well - known @xmath20 gell - mann matrices . apart from a constant , here the central potential is the usual one gluon exchange coulomb potential plus the linear confinment : @xmath21 @xmath22 is the distance between quark @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the color - magnetic interaction reads @xmath25 where the @xmath26-interaction has been smeared smoothly with the prescription @xmath27 the model parameter values are @xmath28    @xmath29    the @xmath2-channel one gluon exchange interaction ( soge ) takes place when a @xmath3 pair annihilates into a virtual gluon ( fig .  [ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "the non - relativistic reduction of the potential is : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the one gluon exchange amplitude .",
    "the last @xmath32 represents that the quark and the anti - quark must have the same flavor .",
    "clearly , the two factors in the brackets mean that this interaction only occurs when the @xmath3 pair is in the color octet and with spin @xmath33 . in our model calculation , the @xmath26-interaction should be smeared smoothly with the same prescription ( [ smear - ansatz ] ) used in the color - magnetic interaction in the same quark model .",
    "however , the qcd amplitude @xmath31 is taken value in the timelike region , where the qcd behavior is still not clear at present time . in the spacelike region , this amplitude is well known from the gluon propagator in perturbative qcd and it reads @xmath34 however , in our study of the hidden flavor molecular states , in order to provide an attrative interaction to favor the formation of the bound states , we need that @xmath35 which means the above formula from perturbative qcd should not be directly used in the timelike region .",
    "this change of sign is first suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite in the study of @xmath36 and @xmath37 scattering .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an introduced strength factor . in our model ,",
    "after the @xmath26-function being smeared smoothly , the soge potential turns to be : @xmath40    first we observe that the potential @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath42 , so the interaction mainly takes place between the light @xmath3 pairs of @xmath43 in any multi - quark system .",
    "next , we will analyse the spin dependence of @xmath41 in each @xmath15 channel of molecular state . for the molecular states",
    "we concern , let us assume that their flavor structure is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath43 . since we can neglect the @xmath41 interaction between @xmath46 , the interaction acts only when the @xmath3 pair is in color octet and @xmath33 as we have mentioned before . more specifically , the interaction will be switched on if the spin coupling of the four quarks is @xmath47_j.\\ ] ] the color structure of @xmath46 and @xmath3 should be octet obviously .",
    "however , the color ( re)coupling is irrelevant to our analysis here and will not be explicitly presented .",
    "furthermore , we will assume no spatial excitation of any quark .",
    "hence all quarks have zero orbital angular momentum .",
    "then the quantum numbers @xmath15 can be determined easily for @xmath48 .",
    "we have following four @xmath41 interaction channels : @xmath49 finally , we can recover the molecular states by the angular momentum recoupling .",
    "we obtain    * @xmath50 @xmath51_0 = -\\frac{\\sqrt3}2 ( q\\bar{q})_0(q\\bar{q})_0    -\\frac12 [ ( q\\bar{q})_1(q\\bar{q})_1]_0,\\ ] ] * @xmath52 @xmath51_1 = -\\frac1{\\sqrt2 } ( q\\bar{q})_1(q\\bar{q})_0    + \\frac1{\\sqrt2 } ( q\\bar{q})_0(q\\bar{q})_1,\\ ] ] * @xmath53 @xmath54_1,\\ ] ] * @xmath55 @xmath51_2 = [ ( q\\bar{q})_1(q\\bar{q})_1]_2\\ ] ] .",
    "then the factor of interaction strength can be read from the coefficients , which we present in table  [ table1 ] .",

    "the binding of @xmath52 states are slightly deeper and tighter than that of @xmath55 s .",
    "so from our model calculation , the @xmath52 molecular states should be easily observed in experiments .",

    "if the @xmath0 is a molecular state of @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the binding energy can be estimated from experimental data@xcite @xmath120 which is very small . accounting the uncertainty of approximation in our model calculation",

    "if the above @xmath55 molecular state exists , the final state interaction will be important .",
    "now , we turn to the possible molecular states in other sectors .",
    "we observe that in @xmath131 sector , there are no such molecular states due to the mass increase of @xmath132 of the light quark pair . on the other hand , in the @xmath133 sector , the binding energy increased as the mass increase of @xmath134 of the heavy quark pair .",
    "so these bottomium - like molecular states with @xmath52 , @xmath55 , and even @xmath50 may also exists .",
    "we can also observe the @xmath135 molecular states @xmath52 and @xmath55 if @xmath123 .",
    "the quark model is extended by introducing the @xmath2-channel one gluon exchange interaction .",
    "the interaction has no effect on the inner quark structure of conventional @xmath3 mesons and @xmath136 baryons . since the interaction is short ranged",
    " a smeared @xmath26-interaction , the effect on the long ranged hadron - hadron interaction is expected to be very small .",
    "so the significant effect of this interaction is only in the so called hidden flavor states of multi - quark system .",
    "we have calculated the heavy quark molecular states of @xmath137 with @xmath45 and @xmath43 .",
    "we find that the interaction can be strong enough to bind the @xmath52 and @xmath55 states , and possibly @xmath50 states .",
    "to compare with the recent experiments , the @xmath0 is a candidate of the @xmath138 molecular state and the @xmath139 may be the @xmath128 state which couples to the @xmath140 @xmath55 molecular state .",
