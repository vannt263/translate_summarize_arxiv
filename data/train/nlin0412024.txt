    "the dynamics of a three - dimensional stratified rapidly rotating fluid is characterized by the geostrophic balance between the coriolis force and pressure gradient .",
    "the nonlinear dynamics governed by the first - order departure from this linear balance is known as quasi - geostrophic dynamics and is inherently three - dimensional .",
    "the theory of quasi - geostrophy is interesting and the research performed on this subject constitutes a rich literature ( see , for example , charney 1948 , 1971 ; rhines 1979 ; pedlosky 1987 ) .",
    "this theory renders a variety of two - dimensional models that are appealing for their relative simplicity and yet sufficiently sophisticated to capture the underlying dynamics of geophysical fluids .",
    "one such model , the so - called surface quasi - geostrophic ( sqg ) equation , is the subject of the present study .",
    "quasi - geostrophic flows can be described in terms of the geostrophic streamfunction @xmath10 .",
    "the vertical dimension @xmath11 is usually taken to be semi - infinite and the horizontal extent may be either bounded or unbounded .",
    "normally , decay conditions are imposed as @xmath12 . at the flat surface boundary @xmath13 ,",
    "the vertical gradient of @xmath10 matches the temperature field @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 . for flows with zero potential vorticity , this surface temperature field can be identified with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the ( horizontal ) two - dimensional laplacian . here",
    ", the operator @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the wavenumber and @xmath21 is the fourier transform of @xmath22 .",
    "the conservation equation governing the advection of the temperature @xmath16 by the surface flow is ( blumen 1978 ; pedlosky 1987 ; pierrehumbert , held & swanson 1994 ; held 1995 ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "this equation is known as the sqg equation .    in this paper a forced - dissipative version of ( [ tadvection ] ) is studied .",
    "a dissipative term of the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , which results from ekman pumping at the surface , is considered ( constantin 2002 ; tran 2004 ) . since @xmath16 is the advected quantity , this physical dissipation mechanism corresponds to the ( hypoviscous ) dissipation operator @xmath27 .",
    "the dissipation coefficient @xmath28 has the dimension of velocity and is not vanishingly small in the atmospheric context ( constantin 2002 ) .",
    "the system is assumed to be driven by a forcing @xmath29 , for which the spectral support is confined to wavenumbers @xmath30 ( in bounded turbulence , wavenumber zero is replaced by the minimum wavenumber ) .",
    "thus , the forced - dissipative sqg equation can be written as @xmath31 it is customary in the classical theory of turbulence to consider a doubly periodic domain of size @xmath32 ; the unbounded case is obtained _ via _ the limit @xmath33 .",
    "the jacobian operator @xmath34 admits the identities @xmath35 where @xmath3 denotes the spatial average . as a consequence ,",
    "the nonlinear term in ( [ governing ] ) obeys the conservation laws @xmath36 it follows that the two quadratic quantities @xmath37 , are conserved by nonlinear transfer . here",
    ", @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the power density of @xmath41 associated with wavenumber @xmath9 and @xmath42 is a real number . note that @xmath5 is the kinetic energy spectrum and @xmath4 is the kinetic energy density .    the simultaneous conservation of two quadratic quantities by advective nonlinearities is a common feature in incompressible fluid systems in two dimensions .",
    "some familiar systems in this category are the charney  hasegawa ",
    "mima equation ( hasegawa & mima 1978 ; hasegawa , maclennan & kodama 1979 ) and the class of @xmath43 turbulence equations ( pierrehumbert 1994 ) , which includes both the navier  stokes and the sqg equations .",
    "these conservation laws , together with the scale - selectivity of the dissipation and unboundedness of the domain , are the building block of the classical dual - cascade theory ( fjrtoft 1953 ; kraichnan 1967 , 1971 ; leith 1968 ; batchelor 1969 ) .",
    "this theory , when applied to the present case , implies that @xmath44 cascades to low wavenumbers ( inverse cascade ) and @xmath4 cascades to high wavenumbers ( direct cascade ) .",
    "for some recent discussion on the possibility of a dual cascade in various two - dimensional systems , including the navier  stokes and sqg equations , see @xcite , tran & bowman ( 2003b,2004 ) and @xcite .",
    "the inverse cascade toward wavenumber @xmath45 would eventually evade viscous dissipation altogether because the spectral dissipation rate vanishes as @xmath46 .",
    "hence , according to the classical picture , @xmath44 necessarily grows unbounded , by a steady growth rate @xmath47 , as @xmath48 .",
    "strictly speaking , one may have to address the possibility of a dissipated inverse cascade , i.e. one for which the dissipation of @xmath44 occurs at scales much larger than the forcing scale and for which @xmath49 has a zero time mean .",
    "such a cascade is not a plausible scenario ( and is not the traditional undissipated inverse cascade ) in fluid systems , dissipated by a single viscous operator , where the viscous dissipation rate diminishes toward the large scales .",
    "a discussion of this issue can be found in @xcite .    in this study ,",
    "upper bounds are derived for the time averages of the kinetic energy density @xmath4 and of the large - scale spectrum @xmath5 .",
    "these bounds are derived from the governing equation , involving simple but rigorous estimates .",
    "the bound on @xmath4 is valid in both unbounded and bounded cases , and a straightforward consequence of this bound is a bound on the energy spectrum , which also applies to both unbounded and bounded turbulence .",
    "another bound on the large - scale energy spectrum is derived by estimating the nonlinear triple - product term representing the inverse transfer of @xmath44 .",
    "this result applies to bounded turbulence since upper bounds for the triple - product term are inherently domain - size dependent .",
    "the difficulties of extending this result to the unbounded case are discussed .",
    "some numerical results confirming the theoretical predictions are presented .",
    "a notable feature of unbounded incompressible fluid turbulence in two dimensions is the appearance of infinite quadratic quantities ( per unit area ) : namely , the kinetic energy density @xmath4 for navier  stokes turbulence and @xmath44 for the sqg case . according to the classical theory ( applied to the sqg case ) ,",
    "a ( steady ) injection of @xmath44 , applied around some finite wavenumber @xmath50 , cascades to ever - larger scales , leading to an unbounded growth of @xmath44 ( this is presumably the case for the general quadratic invariant @xmath51 in the so - called @xmath43 turbulence ; _ cf . _",
    "tran 2004 ) .",
    "in other words , if the classical inverse cascade is realizable , unbounded incompressible fluid turbulence in two dimensions constitutes an ill - posed problem , in the sense that a key quadratic invariant becomes infinite . of course",
    ", there still exist finite quadratic quantities , in particular the dissipation agent for each quadratic invariant .",
    "this section is concerned with these quantities .    on multiplying ( [ governing ] ) by @xmath41 and @xmath16 and taking the spatial average of the resulting equations , noting from the conservation laws that the nonlinear terms identically vanish , one obtains evolution equations for @xmath44 and @xmath4 , @xmath52 using the cauchy  schwarz and geometric ",

    "one can then deduce upper bounds on the time means @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which are valid regardless of whether or not @xmath44 remains finite in the limit @xmath48 : @xmath63    for @xmath64 , @xmath65 is also bounded . indeed , from the hlder inequalities @xmath66 ( _ cf .",
    "_ tran 2004 ) and @xmath67 , one can deduce from ( [ averagebound1 ] ) and ( [ averagebound2 ] ) that @xmath68 this result implies that for @xmath64 , @xmath65 is bounded , provided that both @xmath69 and @xmath70 are bounded .",
    "this condition is assured if @xmath71 and @xmath72 is bounded , a condition normally required of the forcing , because @xmath73 .",
    "one may even consider a class of forcing for which @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "upper bounds of the above type on dynamical quantities are rather trivial for bounded turbulence .",
    "however , they are important in the unbounded case , for two reasons .",
    "first , the scale - selective viscous dissipation allows for the possibility of unbounded growth of certain quadratic quantities toward the low wavenumbers .",
    "hence , rigorous bounds on dynamical quantities are not as abundant as in the bounded case .",
    "second , analytic studies of the nonlinear triple - product transfer function are difficult in unbounded domains . in the absence of pointwise estimates for the spectrum , these bounds are particularly useful for qualitative estimates of the large - scale distribution of energy .",
    "for example , @xcite uses inequality ( [ averagebound1 ] ) to argue that the energy spectrum @xmath5 should be shallower than @xmath6 , as @xmath46 .",
    "in this section , it is shown that the physical laws of sqg dynamics admit only large - scale energy spectra shallower than @xmath6 .",
    "this result is due in part to the fact that the simultaneous conservation of @xmath44 and @xmath4 allows virtually no kinetic energy to get transferred toward the low wavenumbers , so that only large - scale kinetic energy spectra shallower than @xmath6 are possible .      for",
    "a given wavenumber @xmath76 , let us denote by @xmath77 the wavenumber shell between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath80 . the shell - averaged energy spectrum @xmath81 over @xmath82 is defined by @xmath83 in the present case of a doubly periodic domain of size @xmath32 , the fourier representation of the stream function is @xmath84 , where @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 being integers not simultaneously zero .",
    "let @xmath88 denote the component of @xmath41 spectrally supported by @xmath89 , i.e. @xmath90 .",
    "one has @xmath91 where the cauchy ",
    "schwarz inequality is used , the sum @xmath92 is the number of wavevectors in @xmath89 , @xmath93 is an absolute constant of order unity and @xmath94 is the contribution to the kinetic energy from @xmath89 .",
    "a simple upper bound for @xmath95 , which is applicable to both the unbounded and bounded cases , can be derived from ( [ averagebound1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , it follows from ( [ averagebound1 ] ) and ( [ spectrum ] ) that @xmath96 this bound is supposed to apply to @xmath9 in the inverse - transfer region . for @xmath9 in the direct - transfer region , ( [ averagebound2 ] ) yields",
    "@xmath97    the upper bound ( [ spectbound1 ] ) suggests that dimensional analysis arguments , which predict a large - scale @xmath6 energy spectrum , are not well justified . if a persistent inverse cascade of @xmath44 exists ( @xmath98 ) , then the energy @xmath4 ought to acquire a value such that @xmath99 . in the unbounded case",
    ", the large - scale energy spectrum then needs to be strictly shallower than @xmath6 , to ensure that the dissipation of @xmath44 does not increase without bound as the inverse cascade proceeds toward @xmath45 . on the other hand , if no inverse cascade of @xmath44 exists , then a @xmath6 energy spectrum with limited extent is possible .",
    "if viscous dissipation mechanisms with degrees higher than that of the natural dissipation are considered , then the upper bounds derived above are not valid .",
    "nevertheless , diminishing energy transfer towards the lowest wavenumbers appears to be consistent only with spectra shallower than @xmath6 ( for low - wavenumber convergence of the energy integral ) .",
    "the numerical results reported in   4 are well suited to this expectation .",
    "an upper bound for the large - scale energy spectrum , based on the nonlinear transfer term , can be derived for the bounded case .",
    "this analysis employs elementary but rigorous estimates of the triple - product term . for @xmath100 , the evolution of @xmath101",
    "is governed by @xmath102 where the second equality is a consequence of ( [ i d ] ) and the second last and last inequalities follow from ( [ ineq ] ) and the geometric ",
    "arithmetic mean inequality , respectively .",
    "it follows that @xmath103 a notable feature of ( [ spectbound3 ] ) is its dependence on the fluid domain size .",
    "the presence of @xmath32 in this upper bound is natural : the upper bound @xmath104 , which is associated with the fluid velocity at scales @xmath105 , is inherently domain - size dependent .",
    "there are no known analytic estimates that allow one to derive an upper bound on the nonlinear transfer function @xmath106 in terms of ` intensive quantities ' only .",
    "this difficulty arises not only in the present estimate but also in other analytic estimates of the transfer function . in other words ,",
    "the nonlinear triple - product term is intrinsically domain - size dependent .",
    "this problem considerably limits our ability to assess the nonlinear transfer in unbounded systems .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that although the upper bound ( [ spectbound3 ] ) has a linear dependence on @xmath9 , it may be more excessive than the bound @xmath107 derived earlier ( even for very low wavenumbers ) .",
    "the reason is that @xmath108 and the prefactor @xmath109 may not be as optimal as @xmath70 .",
