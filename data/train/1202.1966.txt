    "the recent discovery of vortex motions in the solar photosphere has raised the question of the role of photospheric vortices in the energy transport from the solar interior to the outer atmosphere .",
    "@xcite showed that magnetic bright points ( mbps ) are subject to vortex motions in the intergranular lanes .",
    "an analysis of small - scale intergranular vortex structures and their motions has been presented by @xcite .",
    "high - resolution multi - wavelength observations @xcite suggest that the vortices , corresponding to mbp motions , coincide spatially with chromospheric swirls .",
    "@xcite reported on the formation of small - scale intergranular vortices in weak magnetic field simulations of the solar photosphere . @xcite",
    "have demonstrated that solar atmospheric vorticity generation , which reveals itself as both mbp rotary motions and upper - atmospheric swirls , efficiently occurs only in intergranular magnetic field concentrations , and the vorticity generation in the upper solar photosphere is essentially a magnetic phenomenon .",
    "vortex motions in small - scale magnetic field concentrations can generate a variety of magneto - hydrodynamic waves @xcite , which propagate to the outer layers of solar atmosphere , where the energy can be dissipated ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". this mechanism may be responsible for the transport of energy from the solar interior towards the higher layers of the solar atmosphere , including the corona .",
    "this paper is devoted to some further analysis of photospheric magnetic vortices .",
    "we demonstrate the generation of positive , directed outwards umov - poynting flux and also show that the vertical component of the umov - poynting flux vector is generated mainly by horizontal vortex motions .",
    "this finding is confirmed by the numerical simulation of an individual cylindrically symmetric magnetic flux tube embedded in a quiet convectively stable atmospheric model .",
    "we also perform detailed spectropolarimetric diagnostics with the fei @xmath1 line to explore possibilities for observing intergranular vortex motions close to the solar limb .",
    "the structure of this paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe our simulation setup and show the mechanisms to produce magnetic photospheric vorticity .",
    "we demonstrate the presence of umov - poynting flux connected to photospheric vortices in section 3 , and further support this evidence by performing a test flux tube simulation in section 4 , and discuss possibilities for observing photospheric vorticity in section 5 .",
    "our conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "we use the muram code @xcite to undertake simulations of the magnetised photosphere .",
    "the code is extensively used in the solar physics community and is described in great detail in the literature ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our simulation procedure is similar to that described in @xcite , and here we provide only a brief description .",
    "the numerical domain is @xmath2 size , resolved by @xmath3 grid cells .",
    "a uniform magnetic field of @xmath4 strength is introduced into a well - developed , non - magnetic photospheric convection snapshot , and a sequence of snapshots , containing the photospheric plasma parameters , is recorded .",
    "here we use a well - developed snapshot of photospheric magneto - convection recorded after 1 hour of the physical simulation time , during which the magnetic field has collapsed into the intergranular lanes and the simulation has achieved statistical stability .    in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , the horizontal slices of the modulus of horizontal components of velocity @xmath5 and the vertical component of the magnetic field @xmath6 are shown in the left and right panels , respectively ( note that in our notation @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the horizontal directions , while @xmath9 is the vertical ) .",
    "the contours on the left panel bound the regions with @xmath10 , corresponding to the magnetised intergranular lanes .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the intergranular vortex motions , visible as small - scale semi - circular structures in the left panel of the plot , are bounded by the magnetic field contours , and , thus are clearly co - located with and abundantly cover the strong intergranular magnetic field regions . also , there is clearly a difference in the geometry of the intergranular magnetic vortex flows and granular outflows .",
    "the granular flows have dark granular centres , corresponding to the upflows with small horizontal velocities , surrounded by stronger horizontal outflows , which do not show any small - scale structure .",
    "we analyse the small - scale vortex features in the magnetised intergranular lanes , using the vorticity equation , derived from the equations of magneto - hydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "the process of vorticity production was demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "here we provide only a brief description .",
    "the mhd vorticity equation can be derived by taking the curl of the mhd momentum equation , separating the magnetic and non - magnetic terms and decomposing the magnetic term into two : @xmath11}^{t_3 } + \\overbrace{\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla\\times\\left[\\left({\\bf b }   \\cdot\\nabla\\right){\\bf b}\\right]}^{t_4}. \\label{voreq1b}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath12 is the vortex tilting term , @xmath13 the baroclinic vorticity generation term , @xmath14 the magnetic baroclinic term , and @xmath15 the magnetic field tension term . as shown by @xcite , the latter term @xmath15 is mainly responsible for vorticity production in the upper photosphere , while @xmath13 generates vorticity deeper in the photosphere and in the convection zone .",
    "this is further demonstrated by the right panel of figure  [ fig2 ] , where the height dependences of the terms are plotted on the same scale .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath15 ( solid line ) becomes greater than @xmath13 ( dash - dotted line ) at heights @xmath16 above the approximate continuum formation level , while @xmath13 is about twice as large at the level of continuum formation @xmath17 .",
    "the terms @xmath12 and @xmath14 do not play a significant role in the vorticity production .",
    "it also should be noted that @xmath13 and @xmath15 act in an opposite way and suppress each other , as it is evident from the opposite signs of these terms in equation  [ voreq1b ] . in the left panel of figure  [ fig2 ] , the dependence of the horizontally averaged modulus of the vertical component of vorticity is shown . it can be seen from the figure that , in accordance to the physical mechanism outlined above , the vorticity takes its local minimum at @xmath18 , takes its maximum , caused by the baroclinic term @xmath13 at @xmath17 and increases towards the upper photosphere in the region @xmath19 .",
    "the plasma motions in magnetic fields can generate umov - poynting flux . in magneto - hydrodynamics ,",
    "the umov - poynting flux vector @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the plasma velocity field , and @xmath23 is the magnetic field .",
    "it is of interest to measure the vertical , ( @xmath9 ) component of the umov - poynting flux vector ( @xmath24 ) , connected to the magnetic vortex motions in the solar photosphere , since it can be responsible for the energy transport from the solar interior to the outer solar atmosphere .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the dependence of the horizontally - averaged vertical component of the umov - poynting flux vector on height in the simulated model .",
    "as the plot demonstrates , @xmath24 is negative in the convection zone and in the low photosphere , while it becomes positive ( directed outwards ) in the upper part of the photosphere above @xmath19 , in the same range where the magnetic tension term is greater than the baroclinic hydrodynamic term , @xmath25 ( see section 2 ) . in our simulation we find the behaviour of the vertical component of the umov - poynting flux vector to be similar to the result demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that @xcite use a much weaker magnetic field in their simulation , and demonstrate a different mechanism of the umov - poynting flux generation .    to confirm the connection between the photospheric magnetic vortices and the umov - poynting flux , we analyse the effect of horizontal motions on the vertical component of the umov - poynting flux by setting artificially the vertical component of velocity @xmath26 to zero in equation  [ pflux ] .",
    "the depth dependence of @xmath27 computed for @xmath28 is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] as the dash - dotted line . as can be seen , @xmath27 is generally positive , except from a small part of the domain deep in the convection zone , and @xmath27 is nearly equal to the full vertical component of the umov - poynting flux in the region @xmath29 .",
    "it is , therefore , clear that the positive vertical component of the umov - poynting flux in the upper photosphere is generated by horizontal vortex motions in the photospheric magnetic field concentrations .",
    "to further establish a relation between photospheric vortex motions in the intergranular magnetic field concentrations and umov - poynting flux , we performed a test simulation of a cylindrically - symmetric magnetic flux tube embedded into a convectively stable model of the solar atmosphere , using the sheffield advanced code @xcite . in this simulation",
    ", the computational domain has a physical size of @xmath30 resolved by 100x100x196 grid points in the @xmath31 and @xmath9 directions respectively , with a lower boundary located at the photospheric level @xmath17 , and magnetic field configuration as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the expanding flux tube with the magnetic field strength of @xmath32 at the footpoint ( height @xmath33 ) is in magneto - hydrostatic equilibrium with the non - magnetic ambient plasma outside .",
    "we perturb the initially stable configuration with a velocity source located at height @xmath34 in the photosphere and acting for the first 200 seconds of the simulation .",
    "the interaction of the source with the model creates a vortex with the horizontal velocity amplitude @xmath35 at the footpoint of the magnetic flux tube ( see figure  [ fig3a ] ; this image was created with vapor 3d visualisation package @xcite ) .",
    "this vortex also generates the vertical umov - poynting flux , directed outwards to the upper solar atmosphere .",
    "the flux @xmath24 is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig3a ] . similarly to our previous analysis in section 3 , we compare the total vertical component of the umov - poynting flux with that generated by horizontal motions in the magnetic vortex .",
    "the two curves representing these are plotted as solid and dash - dotted lines , respectively .",
    "since these are virtually indistinguishable , we conclude that the vertical component of umov - poynting flux is generated by horizontal vortex motions .",
    "it should be noted that only a qualitative comparison of this result with the umov - poynting flux amplitudes , provided in section 3 , is possible due to the different nature of these simulations .",
    "intergranular vortices , being horizontal motions in the solar photosphere , are not easy to observe .",
    "the fast changing nature and small size of vortex structures , requires high spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "such observations have been used to track spiral motions of photospheric features , including mbps in the intergranular lanes @xcite .",
    "however , it is not possible to directly observe the velocity field of vortices in the upper photosphere using mbp tracking as the photospheric mbps are localised intensity enhancements which are formed deep in the photosphere and do not fully cover the intergranular lanes .    therefore , we consider the possibility of directly observing photospheric magnetic vortex signatures using spectropolarimetry .",
    "horizontal motions do not reveal themselves in spectropolarimetry at disk centre .",
    "however , the situation is different near the solar limb as the horizontal motions show a strong component along the line - of - sight .",
    "also , due to the magnetic nature of the photospheric vorticity , the asymmetry of stokes-@xmath0 profiles ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and the references therein ) , featuring in the regions with gradients of line - of - sight magnetic field and velocity due to layered structure of photospheric vortices @xcite , is expected .",
    "we analyse this possibility by performing radiative transport diagnostics in the photospheric model , inclined by @xmath36 to the north from the solar disk centre , with the fei @xmath1 photospheric absorption line .",
    "the synthetic stokes-@xmath0 amplitude asymmetry image , shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , demonstrates strong signal in the intergranular lanes , as expected .",
    "also , the stokes-@xmath0 asymmetry features in the image have shapes closely resembling the cylinder - like , layered vortex structures , demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "one of the clearest features of this type is located at @xmath37 arcseconds in the image . the spatial resolution required to resolve this feature",
    "is estimated to be about @xmath38 in low light conditions due to limb darkening .",
    "thus , future instruments for high - resolution spectropolarimetric solar observations with large apertures , such as the planned atst , may be able to resolve these features in detail .",
    "using direct numerical modelling of solar photospheric plasma , we simulate the vortex motions in the magnetised intergranular lanes . through two different approaches of simulations of magneto - convection , and direct modelling of the magnetic flux tube embedded into the solar atmosphere ,",
    "we demonstrate that magnetised intergranular lanes generate significant amount of umov - poynting flux , directed outwards to the higher layers of the solar atmosphere , and show that the main part of this flux is produced by horizontal vortex motions .",
    "finally , we demonstrate the possibility to directly observe photospheric vortices using high - resolution spectropolarimetric observations close to the solar limb .    this work has been supported by the uk science and technology facilities council ( stfc ) .",
