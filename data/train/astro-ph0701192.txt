    "galaxy - galaxy interactions can be an effective mechanism to regulate the star formation activity in galaxies .",
    "studies of galaxies in pairs in larger surveys such as the 2dfgrs and the sdss showed with high statistical signal that star formation is enhanced by a factor of two in close systems ( lambas et al .",
    "2003 ; alonso et al 2004 ) .",
    "the trend of increasing star formation for decreasing relative velocity and projected separation was first showed by barton & geller ( 1998 ) .",
    "this trend was confirmed to be in place independently of the characteristics of environment by alonso et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .    the physics behind the triggering of star formation activity during galaxy - galaxy interactions have been explained by theoretical ( martinet 1995 and references there in ) and numerical analysis ( e.g. toomre & toomre 1978 ; barnes & hernquist 1992 , 1996 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "these studies showed that the starbursts are fueled by gas inflows produced by the tidal torques generating during the encounters .",
    "the efficiency of this mechanisms depends on the particular internal characteristics of galaxies and their gas reservoir .    besides feeding star formation",
    ", these gas inflows could also feed a central black hole and agn activity ( sanders et al .",
    "the co - evolution of galaxies and black holes is now widely accepted although many details on how this coexistence works are still understudied ( heckmann et al . 2004 ) .",
    "toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) suggested that collisional disruption and gas dissipation could feed the nuclear activity of galaxies .",
    "other ideas about the fueling of active galaxy nucleus are the disk of barred galaxies generated by internal instabilities which can lead the gas to the centre of galaxies ( schwartz 1981 , shlosman , begelman & frank 1990 ) and the presence of more that one supermassive black hole which seems likely in the nucleus of merger remnants ( begelman , blanford and rees 1980 )",
    ".    certainly , all these processes may provide clues to solve the agn fueling problem .",
    "however , agn - galaxy interaction paradigm has been the issue of several studies which aim at determining , for example , the frequency of agns in a sample of interacting galaxies , the proximity effects of a close companion on the agn power , etc .",
    "dahari ( 1985 ) , in a sample of 167 systems , found that there is an excess of seyferts among spiral interacting galaxies and also that seyfert activity and the existence of external tidal forces are interrelated .",
    "however , seyfert nuclei were not found in interacting ellipticals . from statistical study of companions of seyfert galaxies",
    "fuentes - williams & stocke ( 1988 ) derived that seyfert galaxies have a marginal excess of comparable size companions and a clear excess of faint companions .",
    "however , keel ( 1996 ) found that the presence of agn does not seem to be related with the type of collisional interaction .",
    "conversely schmitt ( 2001 ) analysed a sample of different types of active galaxies such as liners , transition galaxies , absorption - line galaxies , seyfert and hii galaxies .",
    "this author showed that galaxies of different activity types have similar percentage of companions than galaxies of similar morphological types with no nuclear activity .",
    "this result suggests that interactions between galaxies are not a necessary condition to trigger the nuclear activity in agns .",
    "similar results were found by kelm , focardi & zitelli ( 2004 ) by studying a sample of seyfert in uzc - compact groups and by coldwell & lambas ( 2006 ) who analyzed the percentage of close companions of sdss quasars within the range @xmath7 kpc @xmath1 and @xmath8 .    an interesting approach to study",

    "k03 have constructed a catalogue with a subset of 88178 narrow emission line galaxies that are classified as agn , within redshift range 0.02 @xmath19 0.3 .",
    "considering the unified model ( antonucci 1993 ) , agns can be separated into two categories : type 1 agn where the black hole and the associated continuum and broad emission - line region is viewed directly and type 2 agns where only the narrow line region can be observed due to the obscuring medium .",
    "the baldwin , phillips & terlevich ( bpt , 1981 ) line - ratio diagram allow us to distinguish type 2 agns from normal star forming galaxies by considering the intensity ratios of two pairs of relatively strong emission lines .",

    "2004 ; 2006 ) , we selected galaxies in pairs adopting projected relative distance and relative velocity thresholds : @xmath25 kpc @xmath1 and @xmath26 km @xmath3 .",
    "we found that these limits are adequate to define galaxy pairs with enhanced star formation activity . in these works",
    "we also detected a clear correlation between star formation activity and the proximity to a close neighbour supporting the physical scenario where tidal torques generated during the interactions trigger gas inflows , feeding the star formation activity .",
    "for the purpose of analysing the effects of close interactions , which are known to produce the strongest effects , we selected close pair galaxies by requiring @xmath27 kpc @xmath1 and @xmath28 km @xmath3 . with this further restriction to closer relative separations , the effects of interactions",
    "are largely increased as shown by lambas et al .",
    "galaxy pairs are only selected within a redshift range @xmath29 in order to avoid strong incompleteness at larger distances as well as significant contributions from peculiar velocities at low redshift .",
    "the final pair catalog in the sdss - dr4 comprises 1607 close galaxy pairs . following the procedure explained by lambas et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we constructed a control sample by selecting those galaxies without a close companion within @xmath30 kpc @xmath1 and @xmath31 km @xmath3 .",
    "the control sample is also required to have the same redshift and magnitude distribution as our close galaxy pair catalog .    as discussed in alonso et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the effects of incompleteness or aperture ( e.g see also balogh et al.2004ab ) do not introduce important bias in the galaxy pair catalogs .",
    "regarding incompleteness , by combining the spectroscopic and photometric surveys , alonso et al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimated that the spectroscopic catalog has only an incompleteness of @xmath32 9.5@xmath33 .",
    "hence , neither effect is expected to have a strong impact in our close galaxy pair catalog .",
    "as a first step , we identify agn hosts in our close pair catalog ( i.e. pairs with @xmath27 kpc @xmath1 and @xmath28 km @xmath3 ) by cross - correlating it with the agn catalog .",
    "we found 498 galaxy pairs with one member exhibiting agn activity .",
    "this represent @xmath32 30@xmath33 of the total close pair catalogue .",
    "we also detected that 108 close pairs have both members classified as agns ( @xmath32 7@xmath33 ) .",
    "then , the final sdss - dr4 agn - pair catalog comprises 606 pairs .    for the purpose of properly assessing the significance of the results obtained from agn galaxies in pairs , we defined a sample of isolated agn galaxies from the sdss - dr4 by selecting those galaxies without a companion galaxy within @xmath25 kpc @xmath1 and @xmath28 km @xmath3 , within the same redshift range of the agn close pair catalog .",
    "the procedure followed to construct the sample of isolated agn galaxies , assures that it will have the same selection effects than agn galaxy pair sample , and consequently , it can be used to estimate the actual difference between agn galaxies in pairs and isolated agns , unveiling the effect of the interactions .",
    "a similar reasoning motivated the definition of a non - agn galaxy sample with the same luminosity distribution than galaxies in the agn - pair catalog .",
    "the distribution of absolute magnitude in r - band ( @xmath34 ) and the stellar mass ( @xmath35 ) , of agns in pairs , isolated agns , and a control sample of non - agn galaxies with a similar luminosity distribution than the hosts of agns are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the luminosity distribution is similar in the three samples , but the fraction of large stellar mass objects among agn hosts is larger than that of non - agn hosts : the percentage of galaxies with @xmath36 is @xmath37 for agns in pairs , @xmath38 for isolated agns and @xmath39 for non - agn hosts .",
    "in fact , there are very few agns in galaxies with @xmath40 @xmath41 .",

    "is clearly bimodal as expected ( e.g. baldry et al . 2003 ) .",

    "fig.[fig1]@xmath44 shows the concentration parameter distribution , @xmath45 , defined as the ratio between the radii enclosing 90 % and 50% of the galaxy light in the petrosian r - band .",

    "from the distributions of fig.[fig1]@xmath44 , it can be appreciated that agns reside preferentially in bulge dominated galaxies in contrast to the control sample of non - agn galaxies which show the expected @xmath45 bimodality .    in fig.[oiiinii ]",

    "as it can be appreciated , there is not an evident difference between isolated and agns in pairs .",
    "hence , colours , morphology as measured by @xmath45 , or luminosity , do not provide evidence that interactions could play a role in the triggering or regulation of the agn activity .",

    "it is very unlikely that at these close projected distances ( @xmath27 kpc @xmath1 and @xmath28 km @xmath3 ) pairs could be strongly affected by interlopers ( alonso et al .",

    "we calculated the total magnitude of the pair which acording to our previous analysis should be within 0.02 magnitudes compared to sdss measurements in the case that deblending is accurately working .",
    "we find , however , that the deblending procedure in sdss introduces a larger uncertainty since by adding the quoted luminosities in sdss , the typical difference raises to 0.12 rms . in fig.[magmag ] we show r - band magnitud derived from sextractor routines versus r - band magnitud extracted from sdss , for a sample of isolated galaxies and for a subsample of 50 merging pairs .",
    "this simple and robust test gives useful estimates of the uncertainties introduced by the deblending procedure adopted in sdss which we argue are about 0.12 mag .",
    "we also notice the lack of systematics in sdss deblending procedures , since the difference between our sextractor measurements and quoted sdss magnitudes have an approximately zero mean .    in sum",
