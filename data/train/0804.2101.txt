    "mixed - valance manganites @xmath12mno@xmath4 ( @xmath13 : rare - earth , @xmath14 : alkaline - earth elements ) have been intensively studied for more than a decade since the discovery of the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) phenomenon.@xcite this class of materials is attractive to scientists due to not only their potential for practical applications , but also their rich and intriguing fundamental physics .",
    "the mn@xmath15/mn@xmath16 mixed valence leads to a coexistence of competing interactions among the mn ions .",
    "while antiferromagnetic ( af ) and insulator - like behavior are found in the systems dominated by mn@xmath15-o@xmath17-mn@xmath15 and mn@xmath16-o@xmath17-mn@xmath16 superexchange ( se ) interactions , ferromagnetic ( fm ) and metallic behavior are realized in those mn@xmath15-o@xmath17-mn@xmath16 double - exchange ( de ) couplings@xcite are pertinently introduced by doping @xmath18 ions at the @xmath13-site . along with the mixed interaction character ,",
    "lattice distortions ( such as jahn - teller and gdfeo@xmath4-type ) and phase segregation phenomena also play important roles governing the physical properties of the materials . depending on the compositions and external conditions ,",
    "the properties of manganites can be ranged from disordered to ordered , from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic , from insulating to metallic.@xcite    on the search for compositions with novel properties , results for both @xmath13- and mn - site substitutions have been quite well documented in the literature . for the @xmath13-site substitution",
    ", magnetic and transport properties have been found to be quite systematically influenced by the gdfeo@xmath4-type lattice distortion and lattice disorder associated with the size and size mismatch of the @xmath13-site cations.@xcite however , doping at the mn - site would create a much more complicated scenario . since",
    "double exchange has been found to exist so far only between mn ions , any substitution at the mn - site would lead to a weakening of the de ferromagnetism and therefore a deterioration of the metal - like conduction .",
    "if the substituting ion carries a net spin moment , magnetic interactions between mn ions and the substituent are inevitable .",
    "the exchange interactions among mn ions would also vary with doping as a result of the structural modification due to ionic size mismatch .",
    "in addition , the ionic ratio mn@xmath15/mn@xmath16 would be changed adapting to the valence and concentration of the substituting ions .",
    "these effects therefore effectively hinder systematic studies of the mn - site substitution in manganites .",
    "in a recent study,@xcite it has been found that a selective substitution of mn by non - magnetic elements could reveal important information on the interactions among mn ions in a manganite .",
    "the authors proposed that the dilution of the mn lattice leads to a decrease of the molecular field acting on mn ions and therefore suppresses the ferromagnetism . in the low substitution ranges ,",

    "since @xmath6 has the tendency to reduce to zero at @xmath9=1 , based on the molecular - field theory ( mft ) approximation , the authors suggested that the de mechanism is totally dominant in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath4 , playing a role behind the fact that the system has the highest @xmath6 among perovskite manganites known to date . in the present paper ,",
    "we report our study on the magnetic and transport properties of la@xmath0ca@xmath1mn@xmath2__m__@xmath3o@xmath4 ( _ _ m__@xmath5=al , ti ) compounds .",
    "results from previous studies on similar systems were reported and can be referenced in a number of publications.@xcite our study is focused mainly on the dilution effects in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mn@xmath2__m__@xmath3o@xmath4 in comparison with la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath2__m__@xmath3o@xmath4 .",
    "the dilution of mn lattice results in a strong suppression of the ferromagnetism , a deterioration of the conductivity , and a huge development of the magnetoresistance .",
    "the @xmath8 curves obtained for the two series of our samples , according to the mft approximation , suggest a significant contribution of antiferromagnetic superexchange in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath4 , in contrast to la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath4 .",
    "all the la@xmath0ca@xmath1mn@xmath2__m__@xmath3o@xmath4 ( denoted as lcma@xmath19 for _ _ m__@xmath5=al and lcmt@xmath19 for _ _ m__@xmath5=ti ) samples were prepared using a conventional solid state reaction method from pure ( @xmath2099.99% ) raw powders of la@xmath21o@xmath4 , caco@xmath4 , mno@xmath21 , al@xmath21o@xmath4 , and tio@xmath21 .",
    "the powders with appropriate amounts were thoroughly ground , mixed , pelletized , and then calcined at several processing steps with increasing temperatures from 900 @xmath22c to 1200 @xmath22c and intermediate grindings .",
    "the products were then sintered at 1300 @xmath22c for 48 h in ambient atmosphere followed by a very slow cooling process from the sintering to room temperature with an annealing step at 700 @xmath22c for 5 hours .",
    "room - temperature x - ray diffraction patterns ( measured by a siemens - d5000 with cu-@xmath23 radiation ) showed that all of the samples are single phase with perovskite orthorhombic ( space group @xmath24 ) structures ; structural data were calculated using rietveld refinements .",
    "redox titration experiments ( using k@xmath21cr@xmath21o@xmath25 titrant and c@xmath26h@xmath27ban@xmath21o@xmath28s@xmath21 colorimetric indicator ) show almost no oxygen deficiencies or excesses ( @xmath29@xmath300.006 ) in all the samples .",

    "and ti@xmath16 for mn@xmath15 and mn@xmath16 , respectively.,width=238 ]    in several previous publications , there were concerns that al@xmath15 could substitute for mn@xmath16 , resulting in an oxygen understoichiometry in some al - doped manganites.@xcite in the case of ti - doping , an oxygen overstoichiometry might be realized if mn@xmath15 is replaced with ti@xmath16 .",
    "if the oxygen concentration is kept stoichiometric , the substitution of al and ti for mn is therefore expected to be selective , implying that al@xmath15 would only substitute for mn@xmath15 and ti@xmath16 for mn@xmath16.@xcite this is indeed supported in the present la@xmath0ca@xmath1mn@xmath2__m__@xmath3o@xmath4 samples by the fact that there is almost no deficient or excessive oxygen as determined from the redox titration experiments .",
    "moreover , the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] show that the unit cell volume derived from x - ray diffraction data monotonically decreases with al substitution while it increases with increasing ti concentration .",
    "these structural variations give a further convincing evidence for the selective substitution of al@xmath15 and ti@xmath16 for mn@xmath15 and mn@xmath16 , respectively , considering that the ionic radius of al@xmath15 ( 0.535  ) is smaller than that of mn@xmath15 ( 0.645  ) and ti@xmath16 ( 0.605  ) is larger than mn@xmath16 ( 0.530 ).@xcite    : ( a ) @xmath31 and @xmath32 curves measured in @xmath33=100 g ,",

    "[ fig2]a presents the @xmath36 curves of the lcma@xmath19 series . a sharp ferromagnetic - paramagnetic ( fm - pm ) phase transition is observed for all the samples in the low doping region .",
    "the parent compound , la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath4 , shows a fm - pm transition temperature @xmath6 of @xmath37247 k. with increasing @xmath7 , the ferromagnetism is severely suppressed , indicated by a drastic decrease of @xmath6 .",
    "the shape of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 curves of the @xmath7@xmath200.15 samples suggests that , although a fm - pm transition is still observed for @xmath7=0.15 , they are no longer pure ferromagnets , but spin - glass - like systems of short - range ferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the @xmath6 vs @xmath7 data extracted from the @xmath36 curves for the ferromagnetic samples are plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and will be discussed later in detail .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , the conductivity is also strongly suppressed by the al substitution .",
    "although a metal - insulator ( mi ) transition is observed for all the ferromagnetic ( @xmath7@xmath380.1 ) compounds near the transition temperature @xmath6 , the resistivity increases in both fm and pm states .",
    "the resistivity drop at @xmath6 and the metallic conducting behavior in the fm state can be well explained by the double - exchange ( de ) mechanism where a parallel alignment of the magnetic moments favors the transfer of @xmath10 electrons between mn@xmath15 and mn@xmath16 ions . since al@xmath15",
    "does not participate in double exchange , it blocks all the conducting paths at the sites it occupies .",
    "the metallic conducting behavior is thus not expected in the highly substituted samples where the long - range fm order collapses into short - range fm correlations ; the system consists of conducting fm regions separated by insulating non - fm boundaries .",
    "such behavior can be seen in the @xmath7=0.15 and 0.2 samples as the resistance with decreasing temperature monotonically increases up to the limit of our measurement system ( @xmath372@xmath39 @xmath40 ) showing no observable mi transition .",
    "the resistance of these samples is still unmeasurably high down to temperatures as low as of 2 k and even in an applied field of 60 kg .",

    "as expected , all the low doped samples show a peak of _ mr _ near the fm - pm phase transition that is typical of the cmr effect . although a maximum of _ mr _ can not be measured for the highly doped samples , @xmath7=0.15 and 0.2 , a clear development of the cmr effect with increasing al concentration",
    "is observed . at the phase transition ,",
    "value increases from @xmath37400% for @xmath7=0 to @xmath374200% for @xmath7=0.1 .",
    "the @xmath7=0.15 sample shows a monotonous increase of _ mr _ with lowering temperature that reaches up to @xmath374700% at @xmath3773 k. a similar improvement of the cmr effect was previously observed in la@xmath44sr@xmath45mn@xmath2al@xmath46o@xmath4 by turilli _",
    "et al._.@xcite the authors proposed a phenomenological model to quantitatively explain the relationship between the magnetic and transport characteristics . later , blasco _ _ et al.__@xcite reported a huge development of magnetoresistance ( _ _ mr__=@xmath47% in @xmath33=12 t ) of la@xmath48ca@xmath49mn@xmath2al@xmath19o@xmath50 .",
    "since their al - doped samples are not homogeneous , the authors attribute the increase of _ mr _ to the effect of disorder in the insulating regions . in our work , all the ferromagnetic samples ( @xmath7@xmath200.1 ) exhibit a mi transition and a maximum of _ mr _ at temperatures very close to the fm - pm phase transitions .",
    "thus , the increase of _ mr _ should not be attributed to magnetic field effect on the insulating regions , but directly to the fm ordering according to the de mechanism .",
    "the partial substitution of al for mn not only locally blocks conducting paths where al occupies , but also globally weaken the fm order of the mn lattice ; both lead to an increase of @xmath42 .",
    "the later case is directly associated with the decrease of @xmath6 and the enhancement of _ mr _ at @xmath6 in the low doped samples . for highly doped ones ( @xmath7@xmath200.15 ) ,",
    "the increase of _ mr _ with lowering temperature is due to an expansion of ferromagnetic regions under high magnetic field .",
    "if the al concentration is high enough to prevent the ferromagnetic regions from percolating throughout the sample , the magnetoresistance would increase monotonically with lowering temperature .",
    "however , too high al concentration would also suppress the growth of fm regions and therefore reduce the magnetoresistance effect .",

    "qualitatively , the ti substitution causes similar effects on the magnetic and transport properties as those caused by the al substitution .",
    "the substitution suppresses @xmath6 , increases resistivity in both pm and fm states , and strongly enhances the magnetoresistance effect .",
    "a sharp fm - pm phase transition with a well - defined @xmath6 is observed for all the samples at low substitution concentrations .",
    "although a pm - fm phase transition is still observed for @xmath7=0.075 , the insulating behavior ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) suggests that this compound is no longer a pure ferromagnet , but a system consisting of conducting fm regions separated by insulating non - fm boundaries .",
    "the highest substituted sample , @xmath7=0.1 , shows the behavior of a spin - glass - like insulating system . while all the fm samples , @xmath7@xmath380.05 , that exhibit a mi transition concomitant with a maximum of _ mr _ at @xmath6 , those with insulating behavior exhibit a monotonous increase of _ mr _ with lowering temperature ( see the inset of fig .

    "the monotonic increase in @xmath51 is contradictory to the reduction in @xmath52 in both la@xmath0ca@xmath1mn@xmath2al@xmath19o@xmath4 and la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath2al@xmath19o@xmath4 systems.,width=238 ]    there have been several explanations for the reduction of @xmath6 in ferromagnetic manganites where mn is substituted by a trivalent or quadrivalent non - magnetic element such as al and ti .",

    "the results clearly show , for both sample series , a widening of the bandwidth with @xmath7 , in contrast to the decrease of @xmath6 ( see fig . 5 and the results in ref .",
    "these results unambiguously indicate that the @xmath10-electron bandwidth alone does not account for the suppression of ferromagnetism and conductivity in magnetically diluted manganites .     of la@xmath0ca@xmath1mn@xmath2__m__@xmath3o@xmath4 at low dilution concentrations , @xmath9 ( @xmath9=@xmath7/0.7 for lcma@xmath19 and @xmath7/0.3 for lcmt@xmath19 ) .",

    "selective dilution of mn lattice in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mn@xmath2__m__@xmath3o@xmath4 ( _ _ m__@xmath5=al , ti ) suppresses the ferromagnetism and metallic conduction , but strongly enhances the magnetoresistance .",
