    "active galaxies , the most luminous persistently - emitting objects in the universe , are powered by mass accretion onto a supermassive black hole . but",
    "gas not only falls into the black hole , it can also be blown out of the central engine in powerful winds , as indicated by the blue - shifted emission and absorption lines observed in the rest - frame uv spectra .",
    "outflows are likely to be an essential part of the agn phenomenon because they can carry away angular momentum and thus facilitate accretion through the disk .",
    "winds are important probes of the chemical abundances in agn , which appear to be elevated @xcite .",
    "they can distribute chemically - enriched gas through the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "they may carry kinetic energy to the host galaxy , influencing its evolution , and contributing to the coevolution of black holes and galaxies implied by the observed correlation between the black hole and bulge masses ( e.g. , scannapieco & oh 2004 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the nature and origin of agn outflows remain largely mysterious . blueshifted absorption lines are the most easily identifiable evidence for outflows .",
    "the absorption lines forming in agn winds are divided into three categories based on line widths : broad absorption lines ( bals ; fwhm @xmath14 ) , narrow absorption lines ( nals ; fwhm@xmath15 ) , and intermediate mini - broad absorption lines ( mini - bals ) .",
    "the relationship between these types of outflows is not well understood , although it appears that bal outflows are seen only in luminous quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with narrower lines observed in less luminous objects .",
    "it is widely believed that the outflows arise from the accretion disk , but the point of origin and acceleration mechanism(s ) are not understood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , bal flows are associated with x - ray weakness ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , suggesting absorption of the x - ray continuum by very high columns approaching @xmath16 , that , if also outflowing , strongly constrain acceleration mechanisms .",
    "there is a strong need to measure basic parameters of the flows , but it is difficult .",
    "the projected velocity of the bal is measured directly from the absorption line profile , but the amount of matter and kinetic energy in the outflow is difficult to constrain .",
    "lines are saturated , although not black , implying that the absorbing material only partially covers the source .",
    "the geometry and radial extent of the flows are not known .",
    "the density is difficult to constrain because most lines arise from permitted transitions and are not very density dependent .",
    "line variability provides a valuable tool for studying the absorbing gas .",
    "for example , variation in absorption - line apparent optical depths can sometimes be attributed to differences in ionization , and the variability time scale can be used to place lower limits on the electron density .",
    "this information can then be used to constrain the distance from the nucleus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , line variability confirms the intrinsic nature of an outflow @xcite .",
    "but variations appear to be small in general ; mini - bals become stronger or weaker , and portions of bal profiles become stronger or weaker . for example",
    ", @xcite found that 15 of 23 balqsos spectroscopically monitored showed variations in the bal ranging from marginal to large , but these variations were all limited to changes in the residual intensity in the trough rather than variations in the velocity structure .",
    "@xcite studied a sample of 29 balqsos that had been observed more than once during the sdss .",
    "they found that 16 were significantly variable , but while they found a few that showed significant variations in velocity structure , there was again a trend for a greater incidence of variability in residual trough intensity .",
    "@xcite report results of a study of variability of 13 balqsqs observed first in the large bright quasar survey , and again in the sdss , yielding a 36 year baseline in rest - frame years .",
    "all of the quasars vary , but in complex ways , generally appearing as changes in trough depth in discrete regions a few thousand kilometers per second wide .",
    "capellupo et al .",
    "( in prep . ) also find relatively modest variability to be common in a sample of 24 balqsos observed in multiple epochs .",
    "all together , these studies reveal a lack of dramatic variability indicating the flows are generally stable and long term in typical balqsos .",
    "wpvs  007 is a low - luminosity seyfert 1 galaxy ( @xmath17=00 39 15.2 ; @xmath1851 17 02 ; @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , that is known to exhibit rather peculiar behavior .",
    "it was observed 1990 nov 1012 during the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( rass ) , where it was found to be a bright x - ray source , although it was observed to have the softest spectrum ever found in an agn ( inferred @xmath21 for @xmath22 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "subsequent observations ( from 1993 nov 1113 to the present _ swift _ monitoring campaign ) have found the object to be consistently x - ray weak @xcite , and the origin of the x - ray weakness is not known . recently ,",
    "a _ swift _ observation revealed the first detection of this object in hard x - rays ( @xmath23 ) . although the number of photons observed were small , the data suggest that the source is partially covered by an absorber with @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the uv observations presented in this paper provide a possible explanation of the x - ray transience .",
    "we observed dramatic variability in the absorption line properties between an archival _ hst _ spectrum from an observation in 1996 ( discussed in  2 ) in which the object displays mini - bals with a maximum velocity of about @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and a _ fuse _ spectrum from an observation in 2003 (  3 ) in which the object was found to have developed broad absorption lines with @xmath27 and @xmath3 in addition to the mini - bals .",
    "this transformation is the most dramatic ever seen in a active galaxy , and we postulate that the changing absorption observed in the uv is coupled to the transient x - ray behavior .",
    "we measure lower limits on the column densities of various ions for both the bal and the minibal (  2 &  3 ) , and use _ cloudy _ models to estimate the physical parameters of the absorbing gas .",
    "a summary of the paper is given in  5 , and appendices describe details of the _ fuse _ data analysis . unless otherwise specified , we assume @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and a flat universe .",

    "they perform an automated spectral fitting over a broad band pass and present extensive tables of results . however , while this object is included in their paper , their tables do not include information on the high - ionization lines at wavelengths from ly@xmath30 to  @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite present light curves from _ iue _ and _ hst _ observations of seyfert galaxies .",
    "they find evidence that wvps  007 varied among four epochs of observation , becoming faintest in the _ hst _ observation . finally , @xcite present _ swift _ photometry 5468  ; @xmath32 4392  ; @xmath33 3465  ; @xmath34 2600 ; @xmath35 2246  ; @xmath36 1928 @xcite ] , showing that wpvs  007 has brightened since the _ hst _ observation .    since none of the previously published results present the information we need to do the required analysis of the absorption lines , we extract the spectra from the archive and perform the measurements ourselves .",
    "the spectra were extracted from the _ hst _ data `` online '' website for legacy instruments including the _ fos_. these are final calibration data products , so no recalibration was necessary .",
    "the observation log is presented in table 1 .",
    "we first verify the wavelength calibration of the spectra by measuring the wavelengths of galactic absorption lines .",
    "we used  @xmath37 ,  @xmath38 ,  @xmath39 , lines at 2344.2 , 2382.8 , 2586.6 , and 2600.2 , and  @xmath40 ( note that vacuum wavelengths are used , as appropriate for the _ hst _ data ) .",
    "these lines showed that the spectral segments obtained using the g130h , g190h , and g270h gratings were consistent with no anomalous wavelength shifts .",
    "there were no convenient galactic absorption lines available to examine the spectra obtained with the g400h and g570h gratings ; since we find no anomalous redshifts or flux offsets ( see below ) we assume that these spectra are also free of wavelength shifts .",
    "we next merge the spectra starting with the short wavelengths .",
    "we examined overlapping regions for flux offsets and found no evidence for any .",
    "the final signal - to - noise ratio of the continuum varies from @xmath41 at wavelengths shortward of 1600 ( observed frame ) , to 22 in near 2700 , and falling to @xmath42 around 6600 .",
    "we smooth the spectra using a three - point scheme in which the center point is weighted three times the adjacent points .",
    "we correct for the galactic reddening of @xmath43 mag @xcite using the @xcite reddening curve .",
    "finally , we shift the spectrum into the rest frame , adopting the nasa / ipac extragalactic database redshift value of 0.02882 .",
    "the _ hst _ spectrum is relatively blue longward of @xmath44 , but becomes significantly redder shortward of that value .",
    "we show the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] overlaid on two comparison spectra .",
    "the first comparison spectrum is a mean of _ hst _ spectra of two nls1s that were chosen as follows with the intention of finding objects similar to wpvs  007 in properties other than the absorption lines and continuum shape . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", there is significant range of uv emission - line shapes among nls1s ; focusing on , we found that some are rather narrow , strong and symmetric around the rest wavelength , while others are broad , weak and strongly blueshifted .",
    "the minibals absorb most of the far uv high - ionization emission lines in wpvs  007 , but the emission lines profiles outside of the absorption lines appear to be rather symmetric about the rest wavelength . thus , we sought other nls1s that had emission lines similar in shape to the portion of the emission lines in wpvs  007 outside of the absorption lines .",
    "we found that the wvps  007 spectrum most closely resembled that of mrk  493 , which had _ hst _ fos spectra stretching from @xmath45 to 6818 ( observed frame ) , and mrk  335 , which had _ hst _ fos spectra stretching from @xmath45 to 3300 ( observed frame ) in this far uv region of the spectrum .",
    "these two spectra were very similar to one another in slope and emission lines in the overlapping region .",
    "these spectra were processed in the same way as discussed above , and then uniformly resampled on a logarithmically - binned wavelength scale that matched the original binning approximately .",
    "they were then rescaled to match in flux and averaged over the common - wavelength region .",
    "the second comparison spectrum is the fbqs radio - quiet composite spectrum @xcite .",
    "the composite spectrum has a very similar continuum shape as the mrk  493mrk  335 average , implying that the mrk  493mrk  335 have continua similar to the average quasar .",
    "thus , we make the simplifying assumption that the unreddened intrinsic wpvs  007 spectrum has the same shape as the mrk  493mrk  335 average , and therefore similar to that of the average quasar .    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows clearly that wpvs  007 is reddened in comparison with the nls1 mean spectrum and the composite spectrum .",
    "the reddening curve appears to be very unusual , however .",
    "wpvs  007 and the comparison spectra have essentially the same spectra longward of @xmath44 , which means that there is either no attenuation in the optical bands , or that there is no wavelength dependence in the attenuation .",
    "we develop the reddening curve as follows .",
    "we remove galactic absorption lines and then coarsely rebin the wpvs  007 spectrum and the mrk  493/mrk  335 average .",
    "we remove regions of prominent emission lines and compute the ratio .",
    "the ratio was then fit with a spline model .",
    "the ratio appears to be approximately flat shortward of @xmath46 .",
    "the ratio appears to have some structure longward of @xmath47 , but it is clear that is caused by higher equivalent - width optical in wpvs  007 , so it was assumed to be 1 longward of @xmath48 . since the ratio is flat in the optical band , we can not define a reddening curve in the standard way , relative to @xmath49 , as has been done for other agn by e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "instead , we define it relative to 2000 , and assume that the optical bands are not attenuated at all . the extinction curve from the spectra , the spline fit and the smc reddening curve @xcite",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "the extinction curve in wpvs  007 is unusually steep between 2700 and 1700 .",
    "an attempt was made to reproduce this reddening curve using silicate dust and a distribution of sizes @xcite , but it was unsuccessful ( j.  weingartner , p.  comm .",
    "while the unusual reddening curve is interesting , we note that it has no effect on the absorption line measurements or analysis .",
    "the _ hst _ spectrum reveals high - ionization absorption lines in , , and ly@xmath30 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the observed wvps  007 spectrum ( corrected for redshift and galactic reddening only ) between 1185 and 1595 in comparison with the average mrk  335mrk  493 spectrum .",
    "the presence of these absorption lines was previously noted by @xcite .",
    "the absorption lines are clearly resolved , and we begin our analysis there .",
    "preliminary examination of the lines shows that the absorbing gas must occult both the line - emitting gas and the continuum - emission region since the absorption lines are deeper than the continuum level .",
    "we use a template analysis approach to analyze the absorption lines .",
    "briefly , we create an apparent optical depth template from the profiles and then fit that to the and ly@xmath30 .",
    "the template approach has strengths and weaknesses .",
    "a strength is that it is a very straightforward approach .",
    "a weakness is that , because of saturation and partial covering , it yields only a lower limit on the column density of the absorbing ions .",
    "nevertheless , the results provide useful constraints on the properties of the absorbing gas .",
    "we develop the apparent optical depth template as follows .",
    "the mean mrk  335mrk  493 spectrum was resampled on the wavelength scale of the wpvs  007 spectrum and the ratio @xmath50 of the wpvs  007 spectrum and the average spectrum was made .",
    "assuming that the average mrk  335mrk  493 spectrum is a good representation of the unabsorbed wpvs  007 spectrum , @xmath50 should be 1 outside of the range of the absorption lines , and should be less than one in the region of the absorption lines .",
    "the region of the absorption lines was isolated , and the apparent optical depths ( @xmath51 ) for the two lines were computed .",
    "the apparent optical depth profiles for the two lines were essentially indistinguishable implying that absorption is saturated but not black .",
    "the shape is commonly understood to be the consequence of a velocity - dependent covering fraction .",
    "since the apparent optical depth profiles were indistinguishable , they could be averaged to produce a mini - bal template ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "mini - bal has an approximate maximum velocity of @xmath52 and approximate fwhm of @xmath53 .",
    "if the mrk  335mrk  493 mean spectrum is an accurate representation of the unabsorbed wvps  007 spectrum , we should be able to apply the mini - bal template to the mrk  335mrk  493 mean spectrum in the region of and ly@xmath30 , and reproduce the observed wpvs  007 spectrum in those regions . to investigate this",
    ", we fit the spectrum using iraf specfit .",
    "specfit allows a template continuum , and for that we use the mean mrk  493mrk  335 spectrum . for the absorption lines",
    ", we use the template developed from the line and shown in fig .",
    "we fix the template wavelengths ( in specfit treated as a redshift ) to the rest wavelengths for each line , and allow the scale factors to be free in the spectra fitting .",
    "the best fitting model results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] where we see that the template reproduces the and ly@xmath30 absorption lines well .",
    "the scale factors are given in table 2 , which includes also the _ fuse _ spectral fitting results discussed in  3.3 .",
    "the first column of table 2 lists the line , the second column gives the vacuum wavelength , the third column is the scale factor of the template including the uncertainty from the spectral fitting , the fourth column is the template used with the exception of the alternative deblending of the _ fuse _ spectrum as discussed in  3.3.4 , and the fifth column is the estimate of the lower limit of the column density obtained by integrating over the line profile ( eq .",
    "9 , * ? ? ?",
    "the uncertainties in the column densities are proportional to the uncertainties in the scale factors in the fitting , and thus they give only an estimate of the statistical uncertainty .",
    "we use the apparent optical depth to estimate the column densities without accounting for saturation and partial covering .",
    "therefore , the column densities are lower limits .",
    "atomic data were taken preferentially from nist , as well as from the atomic line list v2.04 and @xcite .",
    "the observing log for the _ fuse _ observation is given in table 1 .",
    "the exposure times are split into `` day '' and `` night '' exposures . during the day exposures ,",
    "the satellite is over the portion of the earth in which the earth is lit by the sun .",
    "background from scattered light is somewhat higher during the day exposures , and emission from airglow is stronger .",
    "the lif detectors have larger effective area , and we used both the day and night data from them .",
    "the sic detectors have significantly lower effective area ; thus , since wpvs  007 is a somewhat faint agn , we used only night data from them . hence , the exposure times reported in table 1 are shorter for the sic spectra compared with the lif spectra .",
    "the _ fuse _ data were processed with a modified version of the calfuse pipeline version 3.1.8 .",
    "the modifications involved a reduction of background intensity using a pha selection . the details are given in appendix a. the resulting spectra were then merged and smoothed , and the details of that process are given in appendix b. the resulting spectrum is shown in the top panel of fig .",

    "the spectrum clearly shows the presence of broad absorption lines in both high - ionization lines such as @xmath54 and low - ionization lines such as @xmath55 .",
    "there are a few features that are seen immediately , and they are confirmed by the detailed analysis below .",
    "@xmath56 is present .",
    "this line from the rather low - abundance element phosphorus has been shown to be characteristic of absorption - line gas with high column density @xcite .",
    "the 1118 component is clearly deeper than the 1128 component , suggesting that the lines are perhaps not completely saturated and thus the optical depth is not extremely high , and that partial covering is present .",
    "absorption is dominated by a broad and deep trough , but narrow absorption lines similar to the mini - bals seen in the _ hst _ spectra are observed in both the doublets and also in ly@xmath57 .",
    "the mini - bals are not apparent in the troughs .",
    "before we perform a quantitative analysis of the absorption lines in wpvs  007 , we qualitatively compare our spectrum with the _ hst _ spectrum of a balqso lbqs  1212 + 1445 , also shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . at a redshift of @xmath58 , the _ hst _ stis g230l bandpass samples the restframe 6001200 band .",
    "this comparison is useful because the 10,811-second - exposure _ hst _ spectrum has considerably better signal - to - noise ratio than our _ fuse _ spectrum and thus the lines are easier to identify . in lbqs  1212 + 1445",
    "we see many of the same lines as in wpvs  007 .",
    "the bals are clearly present , and the 1118 component is clearly deeper than the 1128 suggesting again that the line is not very highly optically thick and that partial covering is important .",
    "the velocity profile has a larger @xmath59 but perhaps the same @xmath60 for .",
    "minibals are present in in both objects , and are also clearly present in and in lbqs  1212 + 1445 .",
    "analysis of broad absorption lines is very complicated .",
    "if the lines are overlapping , the continuum may be difficult to identify , and absorption lines themselves may be blended .",
    "the opacity of a line depends on velocity , there may be partial covering that may also depend on velocity , and these can not be diagnosed directly because of blending .",
    "the covering fraction can also differ for different lines and ions . in the case of very high signal - to - noise spectra and unblended lines",
    ", these factors may be robustly deconvolved ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but that is not possible for our relatively blended , low - signal - to - noise spectrum .",
    "therefore , our goal in this section is to use the @xmath61 feature in the _ fuse _ spectrum to derive an apparent optical depth profile to be used to fit and deblend the other lines .    as noted in  3.1 ,",
    "is clearly seen in the _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "phosphorus has much lower solar abundance than other elements such as carbon , nitrogen and oxygen that commonly produce bals ( e.g. , @xmath62 , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , even if those lines are saturated and partial covering is important , it is possible that the will not be as optically thick .",
    "occurs in a region of the spectrum where absorption from other ions is not generally observed , and therefore it may not be subject to severe blending .",
    "in fact , the doublet ratio ( 1118 component divided by the 1128  component ) is 2.03 , and visual examination of the region suggests that the 1118 component has a larger apparent optical depth than the 1128 line .",
    "therefore we first analyze the line with the intention of developing a apparent absorption line template from this feature that can be used for the other absorption lines .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows an expanded version of the region of the _ fuse _ spectrum near , after three galactic absorption lines marked in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] had been modeled out .",
    "for the continuum , we use a spline fit to the _ hst _ fos composite spectrum with an intial factor of 0.7 scaling ( the level shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "we assume that that is solely responsible for the absorption between 1095 and 1127 . therefore , the termination of the absorption at 1095 marks the maximum extent of the 1118 absorption trough , implying a maximum velocity of @xmath63 for the broad absorption lines .",
    "using this fact , the region between 1095 and 1127 can be broken into three parts : one in which the absorption is produced by the 1128 component only ( right on fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , by the 1118  component only ( left on fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , and by a combination of both components ( middle on fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the extents of the 1128 absorption trough and the 1118 absorption trough are also marked on fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .    in terms of velocities , we glean the following information from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . the velocity profile between zero and @xmath64 can be constructed from the 1128 component ( right region in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) . the velocity profile between 3555 and @xmath65",
    "can be constructed from the 1118 component ( left region in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "apparent optical depth profiles from these two regions are easily obtained .",
    "but the velocity profile between @xmath66 and @xmath67 must be constructed from the overlap region .",
    "the overlap region consists of a superposition of absorption from the @xmath66 @xmath67 part of the 1128 trough and the 0 @xmath68 part of the 1118 trough .",
    "thus our strategy to produce the apparent optical depth profile is as follows .",
    "we generate the apparent optical depth by dividing the spectrum by the continuum and taking the logarithm ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "we construct the profile in the 02678@xmath70 band using the 1128 component , and the profile in the 35556178@xmath71 using the 1118 component .",
    "then , the two estimates for the 26783555@xmath70 are generated from the overlap regions by subtracting the known component from the apparent optical depth .",
    "the overlap region is then the mean of these two estimates . to test the resulting template ,",
    "we apply it to the continuum to generate the spectrum .",
    "the two uncertainties in this procedure are the ratio of the apparent taus of the two lines and the placement of the continuum .",
    "specifically , we assume that the derived optical depth profile corresponds to the 1128  component , and the 1118 component is related by a ratio , to be determined .",
    "initially , we assume that the ratio is the ratio of the @xmath72 for the two lines , 2.03 , appropriate if the absorption lines were optically thin and the covering fraction is unity .",
    "the result is shown as the dashed dark grey line in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . by definition , the simulated spectrum models the profile well in the low and high velocity regions of the feature that are created by either the 1118 or the 1128 component each by itself .",
    "however , in the overlap region , the synthetic spectrum clearly shows stronger absorption than in the observed spectrum .",
    "there are several possible origins for the discrepancy between the synthetic spectrum and the observed spectrum .",
    "first , the continuum level could be lower than assigned .",
    "a continuum offset seems unlikely , though , as we set the continuum level at the point where the sharp low - velocity drop on the 1128 component occurs .",
    "more likely , the absorption lines could be saturated ( @xmath73 ) and partial covering could be important so that the ratio between the apparent optical depths of the 1118 component and the 1128 component is less than 2.03 and approaches 1 .    since the ratio of the apparent taus of 2.03 is ruled out , we determine a best fitting ratio as follows .",
    "we define a figure of merit ( fom ) , which is the sum of the absolute value of the difference between the simulated spectrum and the observed spectrum in the overlap region .",
    "simulated spectra are generated using a range of apparent tau ratios between 2.03 and 1 .",
    "the fom is a shallow apparently parabolic function of the ratio with a minimum of 1.35 .",
    "the simulated spectrum using this best fitting apparent tau ratio is shown by the light grey line in fig .",
    "the fit is not perfect , being too shallow for shorter wavelengths and too deep for longer wavelength in the overlap region , but it is clearly better than the fit for a ratio of 2.03 .",
    "another possibility is that the apparent tau ratio varies as a function of velocity , with a lower ratio ( approaching 1 ) for low velocities and a higher ratio for high velocities .",
    "since the fom has no statistical significance , we estimate the uncertainty on this value by examining at the residuals and determining the point at which the simulated spectrum clearly does not fit the data , yielding a conservative range of 1.151.55 .",
    "the constraints on reasonable placement of the continuum are fairly tight .",
    "the absorption decreases sharply at low velocity , and thus the continuum can not reasonably be placed very far below the position where this joins the continuum . likewise , unless we do not see the continuum at all in this object , we can not place the continuum much higher .",
    "we examine the cases in which the continuum was set to be about 4% higher and lower than the original value ; this range seemed consistent with the constraints above .",
    "the results are very similar .",
    "a higher continuum yields a higher maximum velocity and perhaps a slightly better fit for longer wavelengths in the overlap region .",
    "a lower continuum yields a lower maximum velocity and a notably worse fit at longer wavelengths in the overlap region .",
    "the best _ fom _ was obtained for the original continuum level , but the differences are not large .",
    "therefore , we use the optical depth profile obtained using the original continuum level , with an inferred ratio of the apparent optical depths of the 1118 component to the 1128 component of 1.35 . the apparent optical depth profile plot is shown in fig .",
    "the profile has an approximate maximum velocity of @xmath2 , and an approximate fwhm of @xmath74 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , a set of transitions occurs near 1126  , between the two lines .",
    "we do not believe that this transition produces significant absorption for several reasons .",
    "first , if there were significant absorption from , the template that we derive would be wrong ; yet , as we show below , this template produces an excellent fit for the absorption features at 1063 and 1073  .",
    "in addition , we noted the similarity to the lbqs  1212@xmath751445 spectrum also shown in fig .",
    "the troughs appear narrower and are not blended with one another in that object , and absorption does not appear to be present . for future use , we measure upper limits on the column density of a multiplet of near 1085 , and one of near 1126 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) by inserting a _ fuse _ bal template into the model and increasing the normalization until the @xmath76 increases by 6.63 , corresponding to 99% confidence for one parameter of interest .",
    "these upper limits are also listed in table 2 .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum of wpvs  007 has mini - bals as well as bals .",
    "these can clearly be seen on and ly@xmath57 , and they can also be seen on and . they are not seen on or .",
    "they are distinguished from the bals by their distinctive shape , most clearly seen on but also because they have a lower - velocity onset than the bals , as shown in in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . in this section",
    "we analyze the mini - bals in the region of ly@xmath57 and .",
    "we note that although the minibals are not blended , we are not able to derive the optical depth and covering fraction as a function of velocity , both because of the poor signal - to - noise ratio and because of a zero - offset problem ( described below ) . thus , as before , our goal is to produce and apparent tau velocity profile to be used as a template for fitting the other minibals .",
    "the mini - bals are superimposed on the bals , and thus their profiles are difficult to analyze . to define a pseudocontinuum",
    ", we isolate the region of the spectrum between 1020 and 1038 , and remove the regions of the spectrum containing the mini - bals from ly@xmath57 , and @xmath77 .",
    "we then fit the remainder with a model intended to parameterize the pseudocontinuum .",
    "we find that a lorentzian line model plus a constant works well .",
    "next , we need to find the apparent optical depths , generally done by dividing the continuum by the data , and then taking the logarithm .",
    "the problem with that procedure for these data is that the spectrum in the region of the mini - bals dips below zero .",
    "this is , of course , not physical , and may be a consequence of residual background subtraction problems , although as shown in figures in appendix a , the errors are sufficiently large that the data are consistent with zero in the region of the mini - bals .",
    "therefore , to obtain the template , we add 0.1 to both the continuum model and the spectrum before taking the logarithm .",
    "the result is encouraging , as it shows three apparent optical depth profiles that are very similar in shape and depth , although the @xmath78 component has slightly larger apparent optical depth .",
    "we resample the ly@xmath57 and @xmath79 components to the wavelengths of the @xmath80 component , and compute the mean profile . the result , as a function of velocity , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] in comparison with the mini - bal template developed from in the _ hst _ spectra , and the _ fuse _ bal profile developed in  3.3 .",
    "_ fuse _ mini - bal template has approximately the same maximum apparent optical depth as the _ hst _ mini - bal ; however , this is a lower limit as we had to add a constant to the spectrum in order to compute the apparent optical depth .",
    "the _ fuse _ mini - bal seems to perhaps have a sharper onset , a little lower maximum velocity ( @xmath81 ) and a little smaller fwhm ( @xmath82 ) , compared with the _ hst _ mini - bal , perhaps indicating evolution of this component .",
    "now that we have developed apparent optical depth templates for the bal ( discussed in  3.1 ) and the mini - bal ( discussed in  3.2 ) , we can apply the templates to the remainder of the _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "first , though , we emphasize that the template approach has both values and shortcomings .",
    "the templates can be used to deblend the complicated absorbed spectrum to identify which lines are present and obtain estimates of the absorption columns of associated ions .",
    "but since we have only the apparent optical depth profile , and no information about the covering fraction that may be both velocity and ion dependent , we can only obtain lower limits on the ionic column densities .",
    "in addition , we make the assumption that all of the lines have the same apparent optical depth profile , while in reality , the higher ionization lines are sometimes observed to have broader profiles in other objects .",
    "we address this final point in  3.3.4 .",
    "our approach is as follows . as for the _ hst _ spectrum",
    ", we fit the spectrum using iraf specfit .",
    "we use the _ hst _ composite continuum @xcite with the normalization fixed at the level shown in fig .  6 for the continuum .",
    "we use the two templates derived in  3.1 and 3.2 , fixing the wavelength ( treated in specfit as a redshift ) to correspond to the rest wavelengths of the absorption lines investigated , allowing only the scale factor ( effectively , the apparent optical depth ) to be free . to obtain the best fit , we allow the apparent optical depth ratios within multiplets to deviate from the values prescribed by atomic physics .",
    "this leads to separate limits on the ionic column densities derived from each line .",
    "we discuss three regions of the spectrum separately : the / region between 1037.5 and 1135 , the region between 991 and 1135 , and the // region shortward of 991 .",
    "we first fit the region by itself , between 1090 and 1135 .",
    "the results for the fit of the entire _ fuse _ spectra are given in table 2 , where the definitions of the columns were discussed in  2.3 .",
    "the best fit is shown in fig .",
    "the upper panel shows the final model superimposed upon the spectrum , and the lower panel shows each absorption component .",
    "we next fit the region between 1037.5 and 1135  .",
    "this region includes a large absorption feature that can plausibly be identified as .",
    "this line is composed of three components .",
    "the ground state transition has a wavelength of 1062.7 .",
    "the other two transitions from this configuration arise from an excited state with @xmath83 , with wavelengths 1072.96 and 1073.51 .",
    "the @xmath84 values for the three transitions are 0.69 , 2.09 , and 0.23 .",
    "the latter two lines ( the transitions from the excited state ) are very close together in wavelength , and we model them with the @xmath84-weighted mean wavelength of 1073.07 . absorption from ions in the excited state is clearly present ; it can be recognized by the sharp low - velocity onset near 1073 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "we obtain an excellent fit , as seen in fig .",
    "in particular , the position of the sharp increase in opacity at low velocity matches the spectrum perfectly for both components , verifying that this feature is indeed and that significant absorption from the excited state is present    the undeniable presence of the excited state absorption from is interesting because the energy of the lower level is slightly ( 0.118 ev ) compared with typical values of nebular @xmath85 .",
    "population of this level requires @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the einstein a value for the transition from the excited state to the ground state , resulting in the @xmath88 line , and @xmath89 is the collision deexcitation rate , which can be found from the collision strength @xmath90 for this transition . for a nebular temperature of 15,000",
    "k , @xcite give @xmath91)@xmath92 .",
    "the resulting critical density is @xmath93 .",
    "the fitting reveals that the excited - state line is somewhat stronger than the ground - state line ( scale factor @xmath94 vs @xmath95 ) , yielding a ratio of 1.28 . at densities above critical",
    ", the ratio would approach @xmath96 .",
    "this suggests that the gas density is near or above the critical density .      between 991 and 1037.5",
    "there is a very broad absorption feature as well as the mini - bals originating in and ly@xmath57 that were discussed in  3.2 .",
    "is at least partially responsible for the broad feature .",
    "however , if the components have the same profile as the components , and if were the only contribution to this feature , then the high - velocity decrease in opacity should be observed at approximately 1016 ( the point corresponding to 20% of the maximum opacity of the profile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] or [ fig9 ] ) , rather than stretching to at least 991 as observed .",
    "this may be interpreted as evidence that there are several other ions responsible for absorbing the shorter wavelengths . in this section",
    ", we investigate this possibility by including absorption from ions that are conceivably present in the gas . on the other hand ,",
    "the profile could be alternatively interpreted as being broader than the profile ; this would not be surprising if true as the profiles of high - ionization lines are frequently found to be broader than those of intermediate ionization lines @xcite .",
    "therefore , we discuss an alternative deblending in  3.3.4 .    in this section , we take the approach that the bal resembles the bal .",
    "it is clear from the discussion above that we will not be able to model the entire feature using the bal alone , but before adding other lines , we first determine the shortest wavelength within the feature that we can obtain an adequate fit assuming the presence of only an bal and minibal . we find that we can obtain an adequate fit down to 1018 , although the fit is not very good between the ly@xmath57 and the  @xmath97 mini - bal because the bal is required to be very deep ( @xmath98 ) to model all of the deep absorption present .",
    "decreasing the lower limit of the fitting range further yields larger @xmath76 and larger @xmath99 for the  @xmath97 bal .",
    "we observe a ly@xmath57 mini - bal , so it is quite possible that a ly@xmath57 bal is also present .",
    "we add this component , and find a much improved fit around the mini - bals .",
    "we find that the fit is adequate down to 1012 ; for wavelengths shorter than that , the @xmath76 rises precipitously , and the broad ly@xmath57 optical depth becomes very large .    has resonance and low - lying excited state transitions in this region of the spectrum .",
    "the multiplet consists of six components at 1012.50 , 1015.50 , 1015.57 , 1015.78 , 1021.11 , and 1021.32 , with corresponding lower level energies of 0 , 298.7 , 298.7 , 833.1 , and 883.1@xmath100 , and @xmath84 values of 0.042 , 0.042 , 0.032 , 0.053 , 0.053 , and 0.158 , respectively .",
    "we model this feature with three bals centered at 1012.50 , 1015.63 , and 1021.27 .",
    "we obtain a good fit for wavelengths down to about 1000 .",
    "we note that as we add components to the model , the uncertainties on the optical depths increases ; for example , the uncertainty on the @xmath101 component is almost as large as the optical depth . when the uncertainty is as large as the measurement , the detection is less than robust . yet ,",
    "if we maintain the assumption that the entire broad feature between 991 and 1037.5 is comprised of features with the same profile as , the component is necessary .",
    "the can account for the deepest part of the trough for wavelengths as short as 1000 ; however , shortward of that wavelength , its opacity drops rapidly .",
    "if the broad feature between 991 and 1037.5 is a blend of lines with the same profile as , another ion with resonance wavelength around 1000 must participate in the absorption .",
    "we found a resonance triplet that will work .",
    "the wavelengths are 998.0 , 1001.726 , and 1003.6 , with corresponding @xmath102 values of 0.223 , 0.668 , and 0.473 . including these allows a good fit to the shortest wavelength of this feature at 991 .",
    "the results of this fit are given in table 2 .",
    "however , the shortest wavelength component ends up having zero normalization .",
    "we obtain an upper limit by increasing the normalization of this component until @xmath103 , corresponding to 99% confidence for one parameter of interest .",
    "the derived column density upper limit for @xmath104 is comparable to the lower limits for the other two components .",
    "we finally turn to the region of the spectrum shortward of 991 that contains , and . starting with the region between 955 and 991 ,",
    "we see clear evidence for both broad components and mini - bals for and , so we begin by adding those lines .",
    "the region around was fit very well with a bal and a mini - bal . in the region ,",
    "the mini - bal template modeled the region between 972 and 977 angstroms well .",
    "however , the feature was too broad to be modeled by the bal template .",
    "ly@xmath105 falls in this region at 972.5 .",
    "we see no evidence for a ly@xmath105 mini - bal , so we just add a broad component ; it turns out that the data can not constrain a ly@xmath105 bal and mini - bal simultaneously , as the signal - to - noise ratio is very low in this region of the spectrum .",
    "the ly@xmath105 component allows us to extend the fitting region down to 958 before experiencing a poor fit .",
    "we could not find any other transitions in this region that could significantly add to the opacity . if the entire feature down to 955originates in ly@xmath105 or alone , and there are no other unidentified transitions , it would imply that the ly@xmath105 or absorption profile is broader than the profile .",
    "this would be surprising if true , given that these lines are from lower - ionization ions than .",
    "however , we caution that the evidence for this inference is rather weak because the signal - to - noise ratio is very low ( the spectrum is almost undetected ) and because the region not adequately fit by the and ly@xmath105 absorption is rather narrow , only about 4 angstroms wide .    finally , we seem to see a mini - bal and bal near 950 , so we add a component for each of those , fitting down to 940 .",
    "the mini - bal is modeled very well with the template set at the wavelength .",
    "the rest wavelength of ly@xmath106 is only 0.91 below , so it is possible that the absorption feature originates in hydrogen instead .",
    "indeed , a comparison of @xmath107 values indicates that the apparent optical depth for ly@xmath106 should be at least 18% that of ly@xmath57 .",
    "however , substituting ly@xmath106 for the mini - bal gives a distinguishably poorer fit ( @xmath108 for the ly@xmath106 mini - bal , versus @xmath109 for the mini - bal ) , and a wavelength offset between the model and the data can be seen .",
    "thus , while the fit is better for the mini - bal in .",
    "this is an odd result , since the minibal is clearly not present in and , as discussed above . on the other hand",
    ", it is worth reflecting that the signal - to - noise ratio in this region of the spectrum is very low ( fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] ) , and therefore any fit results in this region must be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "there are several ions that could contribute to the opacity shortward of 940 . however , the quasar is essentially undetected in this region , so no meaningful constraints on the column densities can be obtained .",
    "we plot the resulting model and the spectrum in fig .",
    "the results are listed in table 2 . except for the region between 991 and @xmath110 in the absorption feature , and the region between 950 and 960 in the /ly@xmath105 absorption feature ,",
    "the fit is very good .",
    "we also plot the individual components of the model in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows that we can very nearly successfully fit the whole _",
    "fuse _ spectrum using the _ fuse _ bal and mini - bal templates .",
    "but we can not be confident about our fit in the and regions because of the severe blending .",
    "we therefore consider an alternative extreme case where all of the absorption between 990 and 1037 is due to , and all of the absorption between 953 and 978 is due to .",
    "the spectra of other balqsos often reveal higher velocities in higher ionization lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so this possibility in the case of is very plausible .",
    "thus , we present an alterative deblending of the blended and regions , as follows .",
    "we use our successful fits above as a smooth representation of the data and rederive the optical depths and column densities for and with this assumption . note",
    "that this procedure underestimates the possible optical depth since the model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] does not fully account for the absorption between @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the net result is a @xmath113 dex increase in the column density lower limit in both ions , compared with the values listed in table 2 .      using eq .",
    "9 in @xcite , we can integrate over the templates to get estimates of the lower limit of the column densities .",
    "those values are given in the fifth column of table 2 .",
    "the uncertainties given are proportional to the uncertainties in the scale factors in the fitting , and thus they provide an estimate of only the statistical uncertainty .",
    "we would like to determine the physical state of the absorbing gas , and investigate other parameters such as the launching radius in order to understand outflows in agn . while this can be done fairly robustly in some cases where the signal - to - noise ratio is very good and the individual lines in multiplets",
    "are resolved ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is generally difficult in bals because the lines are saturated and there is partial covering of the emission source(s ) .",
    "but the situation is a little better for wpvs  007 because we measure in the _ fuse _ spectrum , and it does not seem to be completely saturated . we find that we can obtain some interesting and useful limits through analysis of the bals using the photoionization and spectral synthesis code _ cloudy _ @xcite .      in this section",
    "we try to constrain the properties of the absorbers by comparing the results of cloudy models with the column density limits obtained in  3.3.5 .",
    "cloudy requires as input a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . as discussed in  2.2 ,",
    "the uv and fuv spectra are clearly reddened , and the x - rays are generally not detected ( until recently ; see below ) , so it is not possible to build an sed directly from the wpvs  007 observations .",
    "however , as discussed in  2.3 , the emission lines of the nls1s mrk  493 and mrk  335 are very similar to those of wpvs  007 , and these objects have roughly similar optical luminosity as wpvs  007 ( @xmath114 , 39.4 , and 40.2 for wpvs  007 , mrk  493 , and mrk  335 , respectively ) so as a first approximation , we assume that the intrinsic seds are similar .",
    "therefore , we construct a sed for wpvs  007 using data from mrk  493 and mrk  335 .",
    "both mrk  493 and mrk  335 have been observed by _ xmm - newton _ and therefore simultaneous optical / uv and x - ray data are available .",

    "so we devise an aperture correction using an observation of the bright quasar pks  0558@xmath116504 observed on 2000 - 05 - 24 .",
    "this object is very luminous , and there is no apparent galaxy emission in the v - band image .",
    "using iraf , we shifted all 10 images using the v - band filter to a common centroid and summed .",
    "we determined the fwhm of the psf from the pks  0558@xmath116504 image to be 3.34 pixels .",
    "we then extracted the net flux within one fwhm , considering this to be dominated by the agn , and within @xmath115 , using a background annulus between @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and derive an aperture correction of 1.35 .",
    "we extracted the flux from the mrk  493 image in a region with a radius of one fwhm and also within @xmath115 .",
    "we then correct for deadtime and coincidence losses using the instructions in the _ xmm - newton _ users handbook .. correcting the flux from the small aperture using the correction factor derived from the pks  0558@xmath116504 observation , we find that about 70% of the flux within the large aperture originates in the galaxy . we also compare the radial profiles from the mrk  493 and the pks  0558@xmath116504 images , finding that they agree within the size of the small aperture of 3.34 pixels and verifying extended emission from the galaxy at larger radii .",

    "the host galaxy spectrum is expected to be red and therefore to not contribute significantly to the flux in the uvm2 filter .",

    "we interpolated over the unobservable far uv using a power law between the _ hst _ and _ xmm - newton _ pn spectra .",

    "notable exceptions are @xmath152 and @xmath153 , for which simulations show much higher column density than observed at @xmath154 , @xmath151 , and s@xmath155 and p@xmath155 , for which simulations show lower column densities than observed at that point .",
    "if the lines are saturated , the observed column densities are lower limits , and therefore the o@xmath156 and @xmath153 columns may be consistent with the other lines at @xmath154 , @xmath151 , but the p@xmath155 , and s@xmath155 would not be , because the lower limit exceeds the simulated column densities at that point .",
    "we note that as expected , there is little dependence on the density for values in the range @xmath157 .",
    "the column densities of p@xmath155 are lower at very low densities and increase as the density is increased , but only for the highest values of @xmath136 . at the highest densities ,",
    "lower - ionization columns increase , primarily at the highest values of @xmath136 . in all cases , the differences are small , and we can not obtain a markedly better agreement with the observations by assuming very high or very low densities .    as discussed in  3.3 , while the deblending in terms of the _ fuse _ bal template presented in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] matches the spectrum well , it is possible that the higher - ionization lines have a broader profile , and dominates the region between 990 and 1037 , and therefore we presented the alternative deblending in  3.3.4 .",
    "the alternative deblending does not attribute any measurable opacity to hydrogen , p@xmath155 , or s@xmath155 ( since the onset of absorption for these lines can not be clearly seen in the spectrum ) , but instead attributes the absorption to o@xmath156 between 990 and 1037 , and to c@xmath155 between 953 and 978 .",
    "using these alternative fitting results , we generate the contour plot as before ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , right side ) .",
    "now we see that all measured ions and upper limits are consistent near @xmath151 and @xmath158 , except for o@xmath156 which is clearly saturated .",
    "we perform the same procedure as above for the simulations using the @xmath131 continuum ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] middle panel ) .",
    "the results are rather similar in that there is again a region of convergence for the intermediate - ionization ions , and in this region , the columns o@xmath156 and h@xmath159 are much larger than our inferred lower limits , while the columns of p@xmath155 and s@xmath155 are much lower than our inferred lower limits .",
    "the principal difference is that the location of the convergence of many ionic columns occurs at a lower value of @xmath147 .",
    "our nominal best solution for this continuum is @xmath154 and @xmath160 .",
    "this result can be understood by considering that intermediate - ionization ions are created at a smaller column density in gas illuminated by an x - ray weak continuum than in gas illuminated by an x - ray normal continuum because the x - ray weak continuum is unable to produce the usual higher - ionization ions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most of the observed absorption lines ( except ) are from intermediate - ionization ions .",
    "quasars are often inferred to have enhanced metallicities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the hydrogen column densities derived above are large , and as will be shown in  4.2 , challenge outflow models .",
    "inferred hydrogen column densities should be lower if the metallicity is enhanced .",
    "we therefore try a @xmath131 model with @xmath13 ( that includes helium enhanced by a factor 1.29 and nitrogen enhanced by a factor of 25 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . here ,",
    "the intermediate - ionization ions converge for @xmath161 at @xmath162 .    since we expect that partial covering is strongly influencing our analysis , the fact that the data and models converge for many of the ions at particular points in these graphs seems somewhat surprising .",
    "this convergence could be coincidental ; alternatively , it could really be the case that only and are very saturated and the intermediate - ionization ions seen in the _ fuse _ spectrum are not very saturated .",
    "this idea is supported by the fact that the upper limits for the undetected absorption lines and are seen in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] to lie either in the region of convergence , or not very far above it .",
    "therefore , we use the column densities of convergence at @xmath161 ( specifically , @xmath163 , 22.2 , and 21.6 for the @xmath8 set of simulations , the @xmath131 simulations , and the @xmath131 and @xmath13 simulations ) for discussion in the rest of the paper , emphasizing that these columns are lower limits . the transmitted continua for these cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "further analysis reveals some interesting facts about these solutions .",
    "first , the choice of ionization parameter is driven by @xmath164 ; specifically , the ionization parameter must be sufficiently high to produce a sufficient column of @xmath164 to match the data .",
    "this means that the ions seen in the uv spectra are the tip of the ion iceberg , since these ions dominate gas with much lower ionization parameters than @xmath161 .",
    "that is , for most elements , most of the atoms are in higher ionization states , including @xmath165 and @xmath166 , but also much higher ionization states , indicating that most of the opacity is in the extreme uv and soft x - ray band . that this is true can be see in the absorbed spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ; much of the continuum in the extreme uv and soft x - ray is absorbed by gas with this ionization parameter and column density .    in summary , we find that we can explain the _ fuse _ spectrum , in particular , the presence of absorption from the low - abundance element phosphorus , with a highly ionized ( @xmath167 ) , high column density absorber .",
    "we need to make the assumption , though , that the high - ionization lines such as are much broader than the intermediate - ionization line .",
    "strongly enhanced abundance of phosphorus is not needed because some lines are saturated , although they are not black because partial covering is important .",
    "this is essentially the same result found by @xcite for the quasar pg  1254@xmath75047 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "a subtlety explored here is the dependence of the result on the spectral energy distribution .",
    "the primary distinction for the x - ray weak @xmath131 simulations is that the simulated column densities of the intermediate - ionization ions including p@xmath168 are large enough to match the observed column lower limit at significantly lower values of @xmath169 .",
    "as noted above , this occurs because the x - ray - weak continuum is not able to create high - ionization ions , and therefore the gas cools via transitions of intermediate - ionization ions even in front of the helium ionization front ( the hydrogen ionization front for the @xmath131 continuum is located beyond @xmath170 ) .",
    "thus , while partial covering implies that the column densities are probably larger than inferred from the apparent line optical depths , and the outflows are still massive enough to challenge radiative - line driving as the acceleration mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see also  4.2 ) , the situation is not as extreme if the continuum is x - ray weak , because sufficient can be produced at significantly smaller ( factor of 6 for solar abundances , factor of 25 for enhanced abundances ) column densities .      as discussed in  1",
    ", wpvs  007 has peculiar x - ray properties .",
    "its flux during the _ rosat _ all sky survey was typical for an agn of its luminosity .",
    "then , many subsequent observations found it to have nearly disappeared from the x - ray sky .",
    "could the variable uv absorber be responsible for the x - ray behavior ?    as discussed in @xcite , wpvs  007 has been detected recently twice in x - rays : first , by _",
    "chandra _ , which observed 10 soft photons from the object ( also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and more recently by _ swift _ , which observed a total of @xmath171 photons , including the first hard ( @xmath172 ) x - rays .",
    "moreover , the _ swift _ spectrum suggests partial - covering ; that is , the spectrum appears to have a soft component , and a separate absorbed hard component @xcite . as discussed in  4.1.2 , the column densities and ionization parameters required to attain sufficient p@xmath168 indicate considerable opacity in the extreme uv and soft x - rays , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "we can use those absorbed continua to predict the x - ray count rates , as follows .",
    "we first normalize the continua to the blue optical part of the 1995 _ hst _ spectrum , noting that the normalization is somewhat uncertain since the uv emission has been observed to change by a factor of 1.5 over the last several years @xcite .",
    "we convolve the x - ray portion of the continuum with the galactic column density ( @xmath173 ) where the opacity is given analytically by @xcite .",
    "we fold the results with the ancillary response files ( essentially the effective area or quantum efficiency curve ) generated for the _ chandra _ and _ swift _ observations . integrating over the x - ray band",
    "pass ( taken to be 0.310 kev ) yields count rates .",
    "finally , multiplying by the effective exposure time ( 9300 seconds for the _ chandra _ observation , and 85,508 seconds for the _ swift _ observation ) yields the number of photons predicted to have been detected .",
    "the results are given in table 3 .",
    "these simulations show that , as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , the predicted absorbed x - ray flux is much lower than the direct flux . the largest decrease ( factors of 31 and 39 for the _ chandra _ and _ swift _ observations ) is found for the @xmath8 continuum , because the _ cloudy _ simulations discussed in  4.1.2 require the largest @xmath169 to attain the ion column densities required to produce the absorption lines .",
    "however , the resulting count rates are much larger than observed : for example , only 10 photons were observed in the _ chandra _ observation , and these absorbed continua predict 454 photons for the absorbed x - ray spectrum .",
    "moreover , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , these would have been hard x - ray photons ( @xmath174 ) , while the observed _ chandra _ photons were all soft ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "the same is true for the _ swift _ observation : the predicted number of photons is 325 , while only 35.7 source photons were observed .",
    "the correspondence is much better for the @xmath131 models .",
    "again , the predicted absorbed flux is much lower than the direct flux , but by only by factors of 58 for the solar metallicity model , and 711 for the @xmath13 model .",
    "this difference is due to the reduction in the lower limit of the column density required to produce the fuv line opacity , as discussed in  4.1.2 .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath13 metallicity model requires a smaller column density , yet predicts a lower x - ray flux .",
    "this is due to the increased opacity in the soft x - rays from the additional metals .",
    "the count rates are still somewhat too high ; for example , the predicted _ swift _ spectrum has 70 counts for the @xmath13 model , and only 35.7 were observed . but considering the uncertainty on the absolute normalization and the fact that the derived columns are upper limits , the agreement within a factor of two is remarkably good .    finally , it should be noted that the predicted x - ray spectra shown in the lower two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] are hard , absorbed spectra but with a recovery toward soft x - rays that would be able to be fitted by partial covering models .",
    "thus , these models would correspond well to the _ swift _ spectrum @xcite but would not explain the _ chandra _ spectrum in which no hard x - rays were observed .",
    "these estimates show that if the intrinsic @xmath119 is @xmath176 , the gas responsible for the uv absorption lines would have been insufficient to explain the x - ray weakness by absorption in the same gas .",
    "however , if the intrinsic @xmath119 is @xmath130 , as indicated by the _ swift _ spectrum , the same gas could have been responsible for the uv absorption lines , the absorbed component of the x - ray spectrum , and also potentially the x - ray soft excess .",
    "there are many caveats , however .",
    "the primary one is that the _ fuse _ and _ swift _ observations were separated by four years , and since this is clearly an evolving system , there is no guarantee that the x - ray and far uv spectra were the same as observed .",
    "in addition , the absorption profile shows signs of saturation plus partial covering , implying that the real column densities are larger than the lower limits discussed here .",
    "furthermore , while the idea that the uv and x - ray absorption occur in the same gas is simple and attractive , there is no physical requirement that that be the case , since the x - ray and uv emission may not be produced in the same region of the central engine ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we next consider the mini - bals .",
    "we combine the results for the _ hst _ and _ fuse _ observations , noting that these were not simultaneous and it is possible that the apparent optical depths changed between the two observations .",
    "following the same procedure as above , we produce the contour plot shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , showing again the results for three cases : @xmath8 , @xmath131 , and @xmath131 with @xmath13 .",
    "an important constraint on the mini - bals is that we do not detect the mini - bals in either p@xmath168 or s@xmath177 ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "we obtain upper limits on the mini - bal columns of these ions by including the mini - bal template in the spectral - fitting model , and increasing its opacity until the @xmath76 increases by 6.63 , corresponding to 99% confidence for one parameter of interest .",
    "those values are listed in table 2 .",
    "considering first the @xmath8 continuum , we find that we obtain a reasonable solution for @xmath178 and a @xmath149 lower limit of 22.8 , corresponding to a @xmath142 lower limit of 22.5 .",
    "this solution is consistent with the upper limit on mini - bal column densities of both p@xmath168 and s@xmath177 .",
    "this solution indicates that the ly@xmath30 , and absorption lines are strongly saturated .",
    "we next present the results for @xmath131 ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) .",
    "we find a rough correspondence for @xmath179 and @xmath149 lower limit of 22.2 corresponding to a @xmath142 lower limit of 22.8 .",
    "again , ly@xmath30 , and absorption lines are strongly saturated , consistent with the observed absorption line intensity ratios (  2.3 ) .",
    "however , this solution is not consistent with the upper limit on mini - bal column densities of both p@xmath168 and s@xmath177 .",
    "finally , for @xmath131 and @xmath13 , we find a rough correspondence for @xmath180 and @xmath149 lower limit of 21.5 corresponding to a @xmath142 lower limit of 22.0 . in this solution , however , the column densities of p@xmath168 and s@xmath177 would exceed the upper limits .",
    "thus , it does not appear to be possible to produce the minibals and upper limits with either of the two continua we are considering .",
    "it may be possible to reconcile the column density constraints from the detections and the upper limits if the upper limits on the unobserved lines are too low . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", this could be true if the covering factor is higher for strong / detected lines than for weak lines . in a patchy absorber with a range of optical depths ( see , e.g. , fig .  6 in",
    "* ) , strong lines could have large optical depth over a larger area , while weak ones could still have @xmath73 but over a smaller area , leading to a lower observed equivalent width .",
    "our assumption of complete coverage for all lines would then lead to a too - low upper limit on the undetected weak lines .      as discussed in  1",
    ", outflows are common in agn , but their nature differs between high and low luminosity objects .",
    "high velocity outflows are generally limited to high luminosity objects , while lower luminosity objects have typical outflow velocities of only @xmath181 .",
    "the dependence of absorption on other agn parameters has been systematically investigated using a sample of low - redshift ( @xmath182 ) quasars with @xmath4 between @xmath183 and @xmath184 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a primary result of @xcite is that there exists a significant correlation between @xmath119 and absorption - line equivalent width , suggesting that the primary cause of x - ray weakness is absorption , with a continuum of absorption columns connecting unabsorbed objects to balqsos . in @xcite ideas associated with that continuum of absorption columns",
    "were further developed ; in particular , the question of what makes a soft x - ray weak quasar a balqso was addressed .",
    "wpvs  007 is soft x - ray weak , both as a consequence of absorption , and it is apparently also intrinsically soft x - ray weak @xcite .",
    "as shown in this paper , it had broad absorption lines during the _ fuse _ observation in 2003 . in this section ,",
    "we compare some of our results with those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one of the principal results of @xcite is that there is a strong dependence of outflow properties on luminosity .",
    "specifically , there are strong positive correlations between the equivalent width and @xmath5 , the outflow maximum velocity , with the optical luminosity @xmath4 for soft x - ray weak quasars , and at any luminosity , soft x - ray weak quasars had the largest equivalent widths and maximum velocities .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , this behavior is consistent with outflow scenarios for outflows driven by either dust or line opacity .",
    "we compare wpvs  007 with the quasar sample from @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "the @xmath4 value of @xmath185 was derived from the dereddened , restframe _ hst _ spectrum using @xmath186 and @xmath187 so as to be consistent with the other data .",
    "the straight line in that graph shows the best fit to the soft x - ray quiet quasars given by @xcite ; they note that it suggests an upper envelope as would be expected from radiation - driven winds .",
    "the filled star labeled wpvs  007 bal is taken from the _ fuse _ bal template derived in  3.3 .",
    "the @xmath188 for that absorption line is seen to be a factor of 13 in excess of the value expected if the regression holds for low luminosity objects .",
    "we note that most of the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] were derived from absorption lines , and it is not clear that the absorption line should have the same profile . however , as shown by @xcite , absorption is typically better fit by templates derived from , and templates from tend to be narrower than templates from .",
    "this evidence , plus the fact that we infer that the absorption profile in wpvs  007 is most likely significantly broader than the profile (  3.3.2 & 4.1.2 ) , indicates that the point shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] for the bal may be a lower limit , and the discrepancy between that point and the @xcite regression may be even larger .",
    "we also plot the @xmath5 for the mini - bals , where we show the mean of the values for the _ hst _ mini - bal (  2.3 ) and the _ fuse _ mini - bal (  3.2 ) .",
    "that @xmath5 is very near the @xcite regression , indicating the outflow maximum velocity that might be expected for this relatively low - luminosity object .",
    "such a large maximum velocity in a low - luminosity object such as wpvs  007 may cause problems for acceleration models . in a radiative - line - driving scenario ,",
    "fundamental limits can be placed by simply considering @xmath189 where the force of the radiative line driving , essentially turning continuum luminosity into wind momentum , is opposed by the force of gravity due to the black hole .",

    "we estimate the black hole mass using standard methods using the _ hst _ spectrum .",
    "we model the region including h@xmath57 with a linear continuum , an template , a lorentzian profile for broad h@xmath57 , and two gaussians for constrained to have flux ratios of three to one , equal width , and fixed separation .",
    "we also use a gaussian for the nlr component of h@xmath57 , fixing the flux to be one tenth that of [ ] @xmath201 @xcite .",

    "* ) , and relative to lower - ionization narrow - line region lines , and therefore we fix wavelength of the narrow component of h@xmath57 to match that of broad h@xmath57 .",
    "the resulting fit is very good ; e.g. , substituting a gaussian for the lorentzian to model broad h@xmath57 yields a much worse fit .",
    "the width of h@xmath57 is measured to be @xmath202 .",
    "we obtain the rest frame flux at 5100 from the _ hst _ spectrum ( @xmath203@xmath204 ) .",
    "we compute the broad - line region radius using the regressions found by @xcite using the flux and a luminosity distance of @xmath205 using their ( inferred ) cosmological parameters of @xmath206 , @xmath29 , and @xmath207 . that is found to be @xmath208 in units of light - days .",
    "finally , we compute the disperson of the h@xmath57 line profile obtained after subtracting the other fitted components , and referring to @xcite , we use a scale factor of 1.2 to yield a black hole mass of @xmath209 .",
    "we estimate the bolometric luminosity by integrating over the _ cloudy _",
    "continuum spectra discussed in  4.1.1 after they had been normalized to match the rest - frame optical spectrum ( recall , as discussed in  2.2 , the uv continuum is heavily reddened ) .",
    "these are given in table 4 .",
    "we obtain a rough estimate of the fraction of the continuum absorbed in the wind by integrating over the absorbed continuum and comparing with the unabsorbed value .",
    "this includes only thermal velocity for the lines , so it provides a lower limit on the fraction of the continuum able to accelerate the wind .",
    "these estimates vary from @xmath210 for the @xmath8 continuum , from which we infer the highest column density , to @xmath211 for the @xmath131 , @xmath11 case and @xmath212 for the @xmath131 , @xmath13 case , from which we require lower column densities , as discussed in  4.1.2 .",
    "we emphasize again , though , that only lower limits on the column densities were obtained . finally , using the opacity profile in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we conservatively estimate a terminal velocity of about @xmath213 ; that is , we observe measurable opacity to about @xmath214 , but the opacity has decreased significantly from the maximum by @xmath213",
    ". it should be noted , however , that as discussed in previously in this section , and in  3.3.4 , the absorption line may have a much higher terminal velocity , up to @xmath215 .",
    "the estimate of the launch radii for the @xmath8 model , the @xmath131 model , and the @xmath13 @xmath131 model are given in table 4 .",
    "for the @xmath131 , @xmath11 model , we obtain a negative radius , which means that the momentum of the absorbed continuum is not sufficient to counteract gravity , and an outflow would not be predicted .",

    "a @xmath219 black hole has a schwarzschild radius of @xmath220 , implying that the launch radius is on the order of @xmath221 .",
    "the radius of the broad line region was estimated above to be @xmath208 , corresponding to @xmath222 , about 14 times the inferred launch radius .",
    "this is could be a problem for the radiative - line - driving model , since the broad absorption - line region is thought to lie at a larger radius than the broad emission - line region .",
    "this may imply that a magnetic component of acceleration is necessary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". on the other hand , the radius of the observed bal gas may be much larger than the launch radius , and the bal simply does not intercept the line of sight until it reaches the blr or beyond .",
    "variability in broad absorption lines in quasars is common .",
    "usually , changes in apparent optical depth , coupling real changes in opacity and covering fraction , rather than changes in velocity profile are observed .",
    "recently , more dramatic changes have been reported ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , although it is important to note that these variability studies were limited to known bals .",
    "the bal in wpvs  007 is distinct in several ways .",
    "first , it is one of the very few known cases in which a bal flow appeared ; other possibly similar examples have been found in the quasars tex  1726@xmath75344 @xcite and j105400.40@xmath75034801.2 @xcite .",
    "second , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , it has quite a low luminosity for the maximum velocity of the outflow .",
    "the development of the bal in wpvs  007 may be associated with its low luminosity .",
    "wpvs  007 has a small black hole mass and correspondingly small central engine , emission- and absorption - line regions .",
    "for example , lbqs  1212@xmath751445 , the comparison object shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , has an outflow with similar maximum velocity , but with @xmath223 , it is 100 times more luminous , and therefore the emission regions are expected to be 10 times larger .",
    "currently , we have only two epochs of uv observations of wpvs  007 : one with only mini - bals ( the 1996 _ hst _ observation ) , and one with both mini - bals and bals ( the 2003 _ fuse _ observation .",
    "thus , we can only speculate about the origin of the variability .",
    "in other variable objects , a favored explanation is generally a change in covering fraction .",
    "thus , perhaps wpvs  007 always had a bal outflow , but rotation of the accretion disk ( assuming the bal arises from a disk wind ) may have simply rotated it into the field of view .",
    "this argument is used to explain variability in quasar - luminosity balqsos in @xcite over 36 years , and thus it would certainly be a viable explanation for change in wpvs  007 with its lower luminosity , thus , smaller size- and time - scales , and longer interval between observations .",
    "another , perhaps more exciting possibility is that the bal outflow developed over the time scale of seven years .",
    "the observations were separated by @xmath224 in the rest frame .",
    "if the velocity of the bulk of the outflow was @xmath225 , then it could have covered a distance of @xmath226 in the interval between the observations . as discussed by @xcite and references",
    "therein , the high - ionization absorption plausibly occurs just outside the corresponding broad emission line radius .",
    "we estimate the size of the blr in wpvs  007 to be @xmath227 , and thus there would have been just sufficient time for the absorbing flow to cover the blr . in an object",
    "100 times more luminous , such as lbqs  1212@xmath751445 , and similar outflow velocity , it would have taken ten times longer , or about 70 years .",
    "so wpvs  007 may be unique in that we observed the development of a bal . since we can observe such extreme evolution on human time scales , wpvs  007 is an important object for understanding bal winds physical conditions and driving mechanisms .",
    "this argument is compelling , but can not simply explain both the x - ray and uv variability .",
    "wpvs  007 was already x - ray weak by the time of the _ hst _ observation in which only the minibal was observed .",
    "so the emergence of the uv bal into the line of sight by the _ fuse _ observation could not have been directly associated with the x - ray absorption .",
    "rather , it is possible that the x - ray absorption ( perhaps a separate but associated component of  shielding gas  * ? ? ?",
    "* ) moved into the line of sight some time after the _ rosat _ all sky survey observation , and before the _ hst _ and _ fuse _ observations . on the other hand , as shown in  4.1.3 , the gas that produces the uv bals can nicely explain the _ swift _ x - ray spectrum .",
    "since we have only two epochs of uv spectroscopicdata , with no simultaneous x - ray coverage , it is difficult to determine precisely what happened",
    ".    clearly , we need more observations to understand what is happening in wpvs  007 . these are now even more urgent with the discovery from _ swift _ that the absorption in the x - ray band is apparently changing .",
    "a second _ fuse _ observation was approved , and even though wpvs  007 , with a declination of @xmath228 was in the region of the sky that could be observed after the loss of the reaction wheels , the observation was never scheduled before the satellite was decommissioned .",
    "an observation using _ hst _ cos has been approved , along with a contemporaneous _ chandra _ observation , and therefore we still have a chance of observing further absorption evolution of this interesting object .",
    "we present optical and uv observations of the unusual transient agn wpvs  007 .",
    "this narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy was observed to be as bright as an average agn of its luminosity in the _ rosat _ all sky survey , but then nearly disappeared from the x - ray sky in subsequent observation .",
    "we present a reanalysis of the 1996 _ hst _ optical and uv spectrum , and an analysis of the 2003 _ fuse _ observation .",
    "the principle results follow .",
    "* we discovered the emergence of broad absorption line features between the _ hst _ and _ fuse _ observations . in the _ hst _ observation , mini - bals with @xmath229 and @xmath26",
    "were observed . in the _ fuse _ observation , the mini - bals were still present , and an additional bal component with @xmath230 and @xmath3 had appeared .",
    "while variability of absorption lines in bal quasars and seyfert galaxies is frequently seen , it is usually limited to changes in the apparent optical depth of the line .",
    "the change in the line strength described here is the most dramatic ever observed in an agn . * using a template method of analysis , we obtain the apparent optical depths of the absorption lines , and derive corresponding ionic column densities for both the bals seen in the _ fuse _ spectrum , and the mini - bals seen in both the _ hst _ and _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "bals are thought to be saturated and have potentially velocity - dependent partial covering , so the measured ionic column densities are lower limits .",
    "we then use _ cloudy _ to try to obtain some information about the physical conditions of the absorbing gas .",
    "we use two different continua : one with @xmath8 , similar to that of a typical quasar with the same optical luminosity as wpvs  007 , and one with @xmath131 , corresponding to the inferred intrinsic value from the recent hard x - ray detection by _ swift _ @xcite . for the bals",
    ", we find that constrains the column density and ionization parameter . for the @xmath8 continuum",
    ", we find that @xmath231 , and @xmath7 . for the @xmath131 continuum ,",
    "we obtain approximately the same limit on the ionization parameter , but require @xmath10 . for the @xmath131 continuum and @xmath13 metallicity , the column density lower limit becomes @xmath12 .",
    "the total column density is lower for the steeper ( intrinsically x - ray weak ) continuum because intermediate ionization ions ( in particular p@xmath168 ) are produced at smaller column densities in gas illuminated by a steep sed compared with gas illuminated by a flat sed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these large column density estimates are similar to those obtained previously for the quasar pg  1254@xmath75047 @xcite .",
    "acceleration of these large column densities challenge radiative - line driving as a mechanism .",
    "we also point out that since the observed absorption can be explained by lower total column densities using an intrinsically x - ray weak spectrum , we might expect to find absorption preferentially more often ( or stronger ) in quasars that are intrinsically x - ray weak . *",
    "the high ionization parameters and high column densities inferred for the bals predict x - ray absorption , implying that balqsos should be observed to be soft x - ray weak , as they are ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , a recent long _ swift _ observation indicates that wpvs  007 is also intrinsically x - ray weak , and thus there are apparently two effects leading to the long - term x - ray faintness of wpvs  007 .",
    "we find that for the x - ray normal @xmath8 sed , the x - ray absorption is insufficient to explain the low _ chandra _ and _ swift _ count rates .",
    "however , for the intrinsically x - ray weak @xmath131 sed , with or without enhanced abundances , the inferred absorption yields predicted count rates are only slightly higher than observed .",
    "the predicted x - ray spectra for @xmath131 have a heavily absorbed hard component , and a soft component due to reduced opacity resulting from the high ionization parameter .",
    "thus , they resemble the spectrum from the recent _ swift _ observation , but can not explain the _ chandra _ observation in which only soft photons were detected @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the absorption column may have been larger during the _ chandra _ observation . despite the fact that the _ fuse _ and _ swift _ observations were separated by four years",
    ", this consistency supports the idea that the x - ray weakness and the broad absorption lines both result from absorption in the same gas .",
    "the weakness in this argument is that wpvs  007 was already x - ray weak during the _ hst _ observation , before the uv bal emerged . *",
    "given the luminosity of the object , an estimate of its black hole mass , the bal terminal velocity @xmath5 , the lower limit on the absorption column , and the fraction of the bolometric luminosity inferred to be absorbed in the outflow , we can estimate the launch radius for the outflow using eq .  3 from @xcite .",
    "we find a negative radius for the @xmath131 solar abundance result , indicating that there is insufficient momentum in the absorbed photons to accelerate the gas to the observed terminal velocity . the largest launch radius ( @xmath232 )",
    "was obtained from the @xmath131 , @xmath13 model , which predicted the lowest estimated column density . however , this launch radius is a fraction ( 1/14 ) of the estimated size of the broad - line region , implying that we must not see it at the launch radius , but rather it crosses our line of sight further downstream . on the other hand ,",
    "if the bal outflows originate at larger radius than the belr , it appears that radiative line driving is insufficient to accelerate the outflow , and a form of magnetic driving may be necessary . *",
    "all other known cases of broad absorption lines are in luminous quasars .",
    "wpvs  007 has a uniquely low luminosity compared with other objects with similar @xmath5 .",
    "it is therefore a significant outlier on the @xmath233 relationship ( fig .",
    "13 , * ? ? ?",
    "* given that there are only two epochs of uv spectroscopic observations of wpvs  007 , one without and one with the bal , it is impossible to determine the nature of the absorption variability .",
    "it may be a change in covering fraction due to a wind from an accretion disk orbiting into the line of sight , as has been suggested to explain variability in other bals @xcite .",
    "but given wpvs  007 s low luminosity , quite unusual for an object with bal @xmath234 , and correspondingly small size scales , it is possible that we have observed the development and onset of the bal outflow .",
    "an approved _ hst _ observation using cos may help us understand the variability evolution in this unusual object .",

    "first , the `` jitter '' files were repaired using the command cf_jitter and the calfuse pipeline was run on the individual segments of the observation . then , the command idf_combine was run to combine the segments , setting the `` @xmath116c '' flag in order to recompute the centroids of the spectral traces in the final intermediate data file ( idf ) . at the same time",
    ", the bad pixel maps were combined using bpm_combine .",
    "these steps were run for data taken at night alone , and for the combined day - and - night data .    at this point ,",
    "the data are ready to have the spectrum extracted and calibrated , and the background model constructed and the background subtracted .",
    "all of this is done by the calfuse script cf_extract_spectra .",
    "agn are faint sources for _ fuse _ , so a high - quality background subtraction is essential .",
    "the data reduction and background subtraction pipeline for _ fuse _ has improved dramatically over the years @xcite . however",
    ", the background subtraction algorithms do not fully exploit an important fact : the background has a different pha ( pulse height analyzer ) spectrum than the source photons . to illustrate this",
    ", we display in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] the pha distributions for the source region and the background region for the lif1a data .",
    "specifically , we extracted the data from the bow - tie lif1a extraction region found in the spex1a009.fit file given in calfuse version 2.4 ( the extraction regions are handled differently in calfuse 3.1 and greater ) , and the histogram of pha is shown as a solid line .",
    "the dashed line shows the pha distribution from background regions of the detector that avoid the apertures and airglow lines , scaled to area of the source aperture , and therefore approximately giving the distribution of background in the source aperture .",
    "this background is an estimate for two reasons : 1 . )",
    "the scattered light is more intense in the aperture , a fact that would increase the estimation of the background ; 2 . ) the regions of the detectors under the apertures have lost sensitivity over the years , a fact that would decrease the estimation of the background . at any rate , it can clearly be seen that the background dominates for pha channels less than 2 and greater than 20 , and we can reduce the background and therefore increase the statistics of the spectrum by excluding these pha channels .",
    "note that we are not the first to reduce the background by imposing a pha restriction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the background files provided by the _ fuse _ team have been carefully constructed .",
    "each one is comprised of @xmath235 background observations , and they vary stepwise in time to account for periodically imposed gain changes .",
    "but they have been constructed for the default pha range , and although they are scaled in the background modeling process , in principle the shape of the background spectrum should change depending on the pha range .",
    "we decided therefore to construct our own background images using the following restricted pha ranges : 1a : 520 ; 1b : 922 ; 2a : 314 ; 2b : 620 .",
    "these were determined as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ; we plotted background and source regions , and determined the range of pha in which the source dominates . to construct the background images , first we determined the appropriate background observations from the lists in the headers of the background files produced by the _ fuse _ team . for our observation , there were 24 separate observation ids that were used in constructing the background images .",
    "in general , the background is different during orbital day and orbital night ; the scattered background is a little higher in the day , plus there are more and stronger airglow lines , and therefore we construct separate background images for day and night .",
    "these various observation segments ranged from 765 seconds to 23345 seconds in duration ; we excluded the very lowest exposure observation from the 2a and 2b detectors , therefore we used only 23 files to construct the backgrounds for each of those detectors .    for each detector and each segment ,",
    "the following processing steps were done .",
    "the day and night intermediate data files were extracted using the _ fuse _ idl program cf_edit , and at the same time the pha restriction was applied . in calfuse 3.1 and higher ,",
    "all events are retained in the data files , and bad data ( e.g. , from flaring or jitter , i.e. , when the target is not in the aperture ) are marked using flags .",
    "we extracted the flag information from the fits files , and then use that information to separate out the good day or night events .",
    "an image can be plotted using the good events .",
    "the image of each background file contains airglow lines , with the day image having more lines and more intense lines .",
    "we do not want the intense lines in the background , so we exclude regions of the image with strong lines .",
    "the flags aid this selection as there is a flag for airglow feature .",
    "a mask is made of the excluded regions .",
    "next , the extracted images are added together , day and night separately , weighted by the exposure time and the airglow mask .",
    "regions with a fractional exposure less than 0.3 of the total exposure time are excluded from the background region .",
    "the day and night background images are convolved with a gaussian kernel with a fwhm of 15 pixels , and a constant is subtracted",
    ". finally , the images are output as fits files in the same format as those produced by the _ fuse _ team ( indeed with the same headers , with exposure times altered ) .",
    "these files are available online .",
    "these background files can be used in two ways .",
    "first , they can be directly used in the calfuse script cf_spec_extract by copying them to the calfiles directory , and changing the bkgd_cal keyword in the primary header of the idf file from which the spectrum will be extracted . at the same time",
    ", phalow and phahigh keywords should be changed to match those of the background files .",
    "the scaling factors for the day and night data , plus the constant , can be extracted from the verbose output of cf_spec_extract .",
    "[ fig15 ] shows the results of our background subtraction compared with the default . to construct these figures",
    ", we first determined the y - direction ranges on the image in which the light from the target or scattered emission is not seen , i.e. , we avoid the lwrs apertures and mostly the mdrs aperture as well .",
    "in addition , regions at the edge of the detector where the background is exceptionally high were also avoided .",
    "`` spectra '' were constructed by summing the events along the spatial direction , and binning by a factor of 16 in the dispersion direction .",
    "these spectra were extracted from the day+night data from wpvs  007 ( black lines ) and from the modeled background data , using the scale factors obtained from the cf_spec_extract output ( red lines ) .",
    "it can be readily seen that the background - modeled spectra from our files match the data better .",
    "in fact , in the case of the 2b detector , the cf_spec_extract modeling appears to have failed for the default data , as the day and night scaling factors were zero , and the background was a constant ; the background modeling did not fail for these data for our background files .",
    "while fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] shows that the pha - limited backgrounds perform perfectly well in cf_spec_extract , there is another way to use these background files .",
    "the background spectra were extracted from the wpvs  007 data as above , and day and night background spectra were extracted from the model files over the same background regions .",
    "then , the wpvs  007 background spectra were fit using the iraf task specfit to a model consisting of the day background spectrum , the night background spectrum , and a constant .",
    "regions where the flux is zero ( i.e. , beyond the edges of the detector ) and regions where strong airglow lines are present were excluded from the fit .",
    "the normalizations of the day and night files were constrained to be in proportion to their respective exposure times . then",
    ", the specfit results could be input directly into a modified version of the cf_spec_extract program .",
    "the result is shown in the right panel as the green line in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] .",
    "it differs only slightly from the result obtained using cf_spec_extract directly .",
    "[ fig16 ] shows the a comparison of the lif spectra extracted using the default pha ranges and cf_spec_extract program with spectra obtained using the restricted pha range and the new background files scaled using the specfit fitting described above .",
    "we show both the day - and - night spectra in dark grey , and night - only spectra in light grey .",
    "the chief utility of the night - only spectra is the identification of airglow lines in the day - and - night spectra .",
    "in addition , the less prominent airglow lines are seen only in the day data , so they can be removed by substituting the night - only spectra in those regions .",
    "overall , there is not much difference between the default and the pha - restricted spectra , even though the background levels are 540% lower for the pha - restricted spectra .",
    "there are detailed differences , however .",
    "for example , the 1b day - and - night spectra do not agree in normalization with the night - only spectra for the default reduction , while they do for the pha - restricted reduction .",
    "in addition , the failure of the background subtraction for the day - and - night lif2b data is apparent for the default reduction .",
    "[ fig17 ] shows a similar plot for the sic data . in this case , only the night spectra are shown .",
    "the sic has a much lower effective area ( a factor of three ) than the lif , and it is difficult to obtain useful results from these detectors for a faint object like wpvs  007 .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the spectrum around 1065 in the lif1a spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] , and the same region in the sic1a spectrum .",
    "however , the sic spectra extend to shorter wavelengths ; in particular , a feature is clearly detected near 980 in both the sic1b and sic2a spectra .",
    "again , overall , the differences between the default spectra and the restricted - pha spectra are small ; however , the restricted pha spectra are slightly less noisy , and approach zero more gracefully ( e.g. , sic2a for wavelengths shorter than 960 ) .",
    "the _ fuse _ observation yields eight separate spectra , and we proceed here to merge them .",
    "wpvs  007 is a faint object for _ fuse _ and as the sic telescope / detector systems have effective areas about 1/3 of the lif , the sic spectra have rather low signal - to - noise ratios ( fig .  [ fig17 ] ) .",
    "thus , we use those data only for the shortest wavelength ranges where lif spectra are not available .",
    "the longest wavelengths are sampled by the lif 1b and lif 2a .",
    "lif 1b is commonly afflicted by the `` worm '' , or shadowing of the grid wires on the detector @xcite .",
    "our spectra are no exception , as can be seen by the difference in the 1b and 2a spectra longward of @xmath236  ( fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] ) .",
    "the worm decreases the effective area , decreasing also the signal - to - noise ratio , and therefore we opt to ignore afflicted region .",
    "we average the two spectra in overlapping region ( 1094.251137.25  ) , and use the 2a spectrum longward of that .",
    "the errors are computed by propagation in quadrature .",
    "we turn next to the region of the spectrum between 987.5 and 1074.75  , which are represented by both the lif 1a and lif 2b spectra .",
    "the lif 2b spectrum has generally a poorer signal - to - noise ratio than the lif 1a spectrum , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] , and the question arises , do we enhance or degrade the signal - to - noise ratio of the lif1a spectrum by averaging it with the lif2b spectrum ?",
    "we also find that the normalization of the 2b spectrum appears to be about 15% lower than the 1a spectrum .",
    "since at the time of this observation , the pointing was still being determined using the lif1a detector , we assume that it has the correct normalization .",
    "we examine the mean spectrum and decide to use the mean of the lif1a and lif2b scaled by a factor of 1.15 between 1011 and 1074.75  .",
    "the lif1a contains useful information longward of the merged region , to @xmath237  , and there is a gap between the coverage of lif1a and the coverage of lif2b from @xmath237 to @xmath238 . in principle , the sic 2b could be used to fill this gap ; however , examination of fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] shows there is no signal in this region in that spectrum .",
    "shortward of 1100 , we use the lif1a , sic1b , and sic2a spectra , as follows .",
    "the lif1a nominally extends down to 987.5  , but as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] , the signal - to - noise ratio approaches 1 at the shortest wavelengths .",
    "the sic2a overlaps up to 1005.5 , but again , the errors are large at the end of the spectrum .",
    "we use lif1a alone down to 1002.75 , and use the mean of lif1a and sic2a between 995.5 and 1002.5 .",
    "shortward of that , the spectrum is represented by sic2a until 992.5 , when it is joined by sic1b .",
    "the uncertainty on the sic1b spectrum is very large at the end , so we use the sic2a alone down to 987.75 .",
    "shortward of that , we use the mean of the sic1b and sic2a spectra down to 920 .",
    "there are several prominent airglow lines remaining in the spectrum .",
    "these include the lyman lines of hydrogen , ly@xmath57 at 1025.722 , ly@xmath105 at 972.537 , and ly@xmath106 at 949.743 , and line near 988 .",

    "<S> sed in our analysis yielded lower column density constraints ( @xmath10 for @xmath11 , or @xmath12 if @xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray weak continuum , combined with x - ray absorption consistent with the uv lines , provides the best explanation for the observed _ swift _ x - ray spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the large column densities and velocities implied by the uv data in any of these scenarios could be problematic for radiative acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out that since the observed absorption can be explained by lower total column densities using an intrinsically x - ray weak spectrum , we might expect to find absorption preferentially more often ( or stronger ) in quasars that are intrinsically x - ray weak . </S>"
