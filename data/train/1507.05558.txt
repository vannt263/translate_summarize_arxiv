    "<S> indistinguishability between the photons is demonstrated via a hong - ou - mandel experiment with a visibility of @xmath2 , while energy - time entanglement is tested via a franson interferometer leading to a value for the bell parameter @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> photonics is playing a key role in the development of future quantum technologies . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to their propagation speed and long coherence time , photons are the most performing support for quantum communications  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , integrated photonics technology enables the development of on - chip platforms for demanding applications of quantum simulation  @xcite , computation  @xcite and metrology  @xcite , and allows to solve critical problems in terms of scalability and reliability  @xcite . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , semiconductor materials may play a central role ; in particular , the generation of entangled photon pairs has been demonstrated using biexciton cascade in quantum dots  @xcite and nonlinear interaction in algaas  @xcite or silicon - based devices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the target property of the generated quantum state depends on the intended application : photons indistinguishability is at the heart of controlled logic gates  @xcite , quantum networking  @xcite and boson sampling  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement is used to speed up algorithms  @xcite , protect encoded information  @xcite , teleport quantum states  @xcite and reduce intrinsic uncertainty in interferometry measurement  @xcite . for these reasons , </S>",
    "<S> sources producing different quantum states while maintaining a high degree of compactness and integratabilty are highly desirable . </S>",
    "<S> gaas and its material derivatives like algaas present a strong case to miniaturize different quantum components in the same chip . </S>",
    "<S> its direct band - gap has already led to the monolithic integration of the primary laser source and the nonlinear medium into a single device emitting photon pairs under electrical injection at room temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , gaas strong electro - optical pockels effect enables a fast control and manipulation of the generated photons as recently demonstrated  @xcite . on the front of on - chip single photon detection </S>",
    "<S> as well , high - efficiency superconducting nanowire single - photon detectors have been integrated with gaas waveguides  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these achievements consolidate the potential of this platform to realize miniature chips containing the generation , manipulation and detection of quantum states of light .    in this letter , we present an algaas ridge waveguide producing highly indistinguishable and entangled photon pairs at telecom wavelengths and room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> our device has been optimized for efficient type - ii spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) ; two bragg mirrors provide both a photonic band gap confinement for a te bragg mode at 783 nm  @xcite and total internal reflection claddings for te@xmath4 and tm@xmath4 modes at 1.56 @xmath5 m . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a ( 100 ) gaas substrate . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a 6-period al@xmath6ga@xmath7as / al@xmath8ga@xmath9as bragg reflector ( lower mirror ) , a 298 nm al@xmath10ga@xmath11as core and a 6-period al@xmath8ga@xmath9as / al@xmath6ga@xmath7as bragg reflector ( upper mirror ) . </S>",
    "<S> waveguides are fabricated using wet chemical etching to define 5.5 - 6@xmath5 m wide and 5@xmath5 m deep ridges along the ( 011 ) crystalline axis , in order to exploit the maximum non - zero optical nonlinear coefficient and a natural cleavage plane . </S>",
    "<S> optical propagation losses in the telecom range of 0.3 and 0.5 @xmath12 for the te@xmath4 and tm@xmath4 modes , respectively , are measured via a standard fabry - perot technique  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the ability of our device to produce indistinguishable photons is tested through a hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) experiment @xcite ; in this type of measurement , two indistinguishable photons enter a 50/50 beam splitter at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> the destructive quantum interference makes them exit the beam splitter through the same output , thus inducing a dip in the coincidence histogram . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1 ] shows a sketch of the experimental setup used for this experiment . the light beam of a cw ti : sa laser is used to excite the bragg mode of the sample ; </S>",
    "<S> after a spatial shaping with an holographic mask , it is injected into the waveguide with a microscope objective . </S>",
    "<S> light emerging from the opposite end is collected with a second microscope objective , a fiber coupler and filtered with a tunable fibered bragg grating ( fbg ) having a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 10.8 nm .    the optimum working point of our source is determined by measuring the temporal correlations between the te and tm photons . </S>",
    "<S> two stirling - cooled free running single photon avalanche photodiodes connected to a time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) are used for coincidence counting  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2 ] shows a histogram of the recorded detection time delays at temperature @xmath13c for an internal estimated pump power of 625@xmath5w in the guided mode . </S>",
    "<S> the coincidence to accidental ratio ( car ) , an important figure of merit for a photon pairs source , is calculated by taking the number of true coincidences within the fwhm of the peak over the background signal , on the same time window taken apart from the peak . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the car on both the pump wavelength and the internal pump power has been studied : a maximum value of the car of @xmath1 is obtained for a pump wavelength around 783 nm and an internal pump power around 625@xmath5w , leading to a brightness of @xmath14 pairs / s . </S>",
    "<S> this working point correspond to the phase matching resonance of the device : for a pump wavelength above the degeneracy point , the phase - matching condition is no longer satisfied and below degeneracy a shift of 0.2 nm results in a variation of 100 nm for the signal and idler wavelengths , which are by consequence outside the interferential filter . </S>",
    "<S> the car value , limited by the detectors dark counts , is the maximum ever obtained on a semiconductor waveguide up to our knowledge ; this is due to the low value of optical losses of our sample and the low level of noise of the detectors employed in this work .    after the identification of the optimum working point </S>",
    "<S> , we proceeded to the hom measurement ; for this we used a polarization controller to align the polarizations of the photons and we inserted an interferometer with an optical delay line on one of the two arms , followed by a a 50/50 beam splitter before the detectors . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3 ] reports the dip observed in the coincidence counts as a function of the optical path length difference between the two arms of the interferometer : this dip is a clear signature of the destructive quantum interference between the two photons . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the dip is given by the convolution of the two wavepackets arriving at the 50/50 beam splitter . since the signal / idler photons </S>",
    "<S> are filtered with a rectangular fbg filter we adjust the experimental data with the theoretical expression of the hom dip : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the coincidence rate , @xmath17 the coincidence rate apart from the bunching region , @xmath18 the visibility , @xmath19 the time delay and @xmath20 the fwhm spectral intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the two fitting parameters are @xmath21 and @xmath18 ; for the first one we obtain @xmath22 nm , in very good agreement with the fbg filter fwhm , while for the second one we obtain a net ( raw ) visibility of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result is an unprecedented value in a semiconductor waveguide ; the limitation to the visibility in our experiment can be attributed to the reflectivity r of our waveguide facets , which is around @xmath25 for the te and tm modes . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a coincidence event can not only be due to two photons directly transmitted by the facets , but also to one photon directly transmitted and one photon having experienced two reflections before leaving the waveguide . since in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> the path difference for the two photons is not the same as for the former case , these photons do not contribute to the dip  @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the maximum achievable visibility is given by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 correspond to the transmission efficiency for the two polarisation modes in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> this expression is in excellent agreement with our experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> standard telecom anti - reflection coating on the facets of algaas waveguides allows to reach transmittivities of almost @xmath29 ; this kind of treatment applied to our device would thus increase the indistiguishability of the emitted photons .    among different possible entangled states , </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen to produce energy - time entangled photons ; this is a very convenient format of entanglement , as it can be easily manipulated with integrated circuits and can be preserved over long distances in standard optical fibers  @xcite . by pumping the device with a continuous - wave laser , </S>",
    "<S> the photon pairs are emitted simultaneously , but their emission time is undetermined within the coherence time of the pump laser . </S>",
    "<S> this lack of information leads to energy - time entangled pairs , as first pointed out by franson @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus implemented the experimental setup sketched in figure  [ fig1](b ) . before passing through the polarizing beam splitter </S>",
    "<S> , the two entangled photons are directed into an unbalanced interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> a piezo actuator is used to control the relative phase @xmath30 between its short and long arm . an essential condition to fulfill in a franson type experiment </S>",
    "<S> is that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the coherence time of the signal and idler photons , @xmath33 the jitter of the detectors , @xmath34 = @xmath35l / c is the time difference between the two paths of the interferometer , and @xmath36 is the pump laser coherence time . as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , the coherence time of the photons is 0.7 ps . we have thus chosen a path - length difference of the interferometer of 2.5 ns , which is also much smaller than the 1@xmath5s of coherence time of the cw laser pump ( toptica dl 100 ) and bigger than the timing jitter of the detectors ( 200 ps ) .    </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figure  [ fig4](a ) and ( b ) the recorded histogram has three coincidence peaks ; the left and right peaks correspond to a situation when one photon goes through the short arm ( @xmath37 ) and the other through the long arm ( @xmath38 ) of the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> the middle peak results from the interference between the state where both photons pass through the short arm and the one where both photons pass through the long arm . </S>",
    "<S> this peak results from the quantum interference of the following post selected state : @xmath39 \\label{equation3}\\ ] ] where the indices @xmath40 and @xmath41 stand for signal and idler .    for perfectly entangled photons </S>",
    "<S> the total number of coincidences in the central peak exhibits an interference fringe of unity visibility when the phase @xmath30 is varied . </S>",
    "<S> the two values of @xmath30 for the measurements reported in figure  [ fig4](a ) and ( b ) have been chosen to minimize and maximize the central peak height , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the height of the satellite peaks is independent of the phase . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement accuracy is 200ps , dominated by the jitter of the detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the coincidence counts corresponding to the central peak as a function of @xmath30 are plotted in figure  [ fig4](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the trend is well fitted by a sinusoidal curve having a net ( raw ) visibility of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) . for the net ( raw ) data , </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a value of the bell parameter s of @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) and a consequent violation of bell s inequality by 6.7 ( 5.8 ) standard deviations .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated an algaas device working at room temperature with proven compliancy with electrical pumping @xcite , generating photon pairs linked by a high degree of entanglement and able to interfere on a beam - splitter with high visibility . </S>",
    "<S> the only solid - state source featuring both the last two properties demonstrated up to now is based on single quantum dot technology  @xcite ; with respect to that result our device present the advantage of working at room temperature and displaying higher values of hom and bell visibilities . </S>",
    "<S> the present results constitute a step towards on - chip large scale photonic circuit - based quantum computation and simulation . </S>",
    "<S> they set the algaas platform in an advantageous position for the development of monolithic complex architectures exploiting photon pairs generation by electrical injection and fast quantum state manipulation via electro - optics effect . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the recent progress on hybrid integration of iii - v compound semiconductors onto silicon - on - insulator substrates allows combining the advantages of our device to a nearly complete suite of silicon photonics components . </S>",
    "<S> these include filters , ( de)multiplexers , splitters , interferometers and photodetectors for the fabrication of novel generations of cmos compatible chips for quantum information technologies . </S>"
