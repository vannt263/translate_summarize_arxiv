    "the thermal conductivity @xmath128 of tb@xmath0gd@xmath1o@xmath2 ( tgg ) has been studied by inyushkin and taldenkov who measured and analysed the conductivity  @xcite .",
    "they fit the temperature dependence of @xmath128 by supposing four processes ; boundary , point defect , umklapp , and resonant scatterings .",
    "it is concluded that _ at helium temperatures for which the phonon hall effect was detected , @xmath128 is almost completely determined by resonance scattering from impurity ions and scattering from boundaries ( size of the sample ) _  @xcite .",
    "following their results , we read the experimental data of fig .  2 in ref .   and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by circles ( red ) .        to obtain the minimal level scheme at @xmath138 15  k ( see fig .  1 in the main text ) , we use the following equations , which are equivalent to eqs .",

    "@xmath59 is due to the finite size of the sample @xmath60 mm ( boundary scattering ) .",
    "the total density of tb ions is @xmath61 , the density of superstoichiometric tb ions is @xmath62 , and the debye temperature is @xmath63 k  @xcite . note that in the considered temperature range the upper limit of integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is @xmath141 , so we can safely set it equal to @xmath142 .",
    "we found that to fit @xmath128 in the temperature range @xmath143 one needs minimum four levels .",
    "three lowest levels are determined from the fit quite accurately , @xmath21 k , @xmath22 k , @xmath144 k. the topmost level , which describes a cumulative effect of all higher states , is somewhat ambiguous , we take @xmath23 k , and @xmath145  k. the fit with @xmath146  ev , @xmath147  ev , @xmath148  ev is shown in fig.[fig1 ] by blue solid line .",
    "the contribution of the topmost @xmath56-level is relatively small , but still it is important for the fit .",
    "this contribution scales as @xmath149 , therefore one can always increase @xmath150 and @xmath151 proportionally . note that since we do not account for thermal population of the @xmath55-level , our fit starts to deviate from experimental data at @xmath152 .",
    "it is known that the ground state energy doublet is very sensitive to magnetic field @xmath24 as shown in the right part of fig .  1 in the main text , @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath128 in a magnetic field calculated at @xmath119  k with values of parameters presented above is shown in fig .",

    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for simplicity we assume that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are not sensitive to the magnetic field .",
    "the suppression of @xmath128 by a magnetic field is reported in ref .  , and",
    "our result is close to the data obtained by the magnetic field in the [ 111 ] direction .",
    "we find that the split of the quasi - doublet state is the main source of such a suppression .",
    "however , to fit the angle dependence of @xmath128 from ref .  , one needs to account different crystallographic positions of superstoichiometric tb ions with different orientations of crystal fields . in addition",
    ", a kind of magnetostriction would be involved in such a magnetic field dependence of @xmath128 . in the present work we disregard these fine details .",
    "we already pointed out , ref .  [ 27 ] in the main text , that @xmath28 states are composed of states with definite z - projection of the ion angular momentum @xmath43 such as , @xmath154 the structure of @xmath55- and @xmath56-states is similar .",
    "matrix elements of the interaction hamiltonian ( 2 ) come from transitions with @xmath155 and with @xmath156 .",
    "it is easy to check that in the scattering amplitude fig .  2 the contributions with @xmath155 result in @xmath157 or @xmath72 and the contributions with @xmath156 result in @xmath158 or @xmath159 .",

    "a particular value of @xmath163 depends on the coefficients in the wave functions ( [ mm ] ) .",
    "both the @xmath164-term and the @xmath165-term in ( [ w1 ] ) have the @xmath84 compensation problem . these terms , as it is described in the main text , contribute to phe only due to correlation of positions of impurities .",
    "this contribution is proportional to the correlation coefficient @xmath135 in eq.(9 ) .",
    "we think that this is the leading term dominating the skew scattering and can explain the sample dependence of phe . however , there is also the @xmath166 interference term in ( [ w1 ] ) .",
    "the interference term results in the forward - backward scattering asymmetry and hence the terms does not have the @xmath84 compensation problem .",
    "this interference contribution in eq.(9 ) is _ not _ proportional to the impurity correlation coefficient @xmath135 .",
    "hence , the skew scattering is always there , even if the impurity correlation @xmath135 was ignored .",

    "detail analysis on the electronic states of tgg will judge this point in the future .",
    "in the main text we point out that there are two mechanisms which destroy @xmath168 compensation : ( i ) spatial correlation of impurity positions ; ( ii ) interference between contributions with different values of @xmath88 . here",

    "<S> the neel temperature of tgg is @xmath5 k  @xcite , so it is a paramagnet at @xmath4 k. hence magnons do not contribute to the heat current and one does not expect a contribution from the magnon hall effect  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> phonons are not charged and hence can not be affected by the lorentz force which gives rise to the usual classical hall effect . therefore the mechanism for the phe must be related to the spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> however , the spin - orbit interaction for phonons is not at all obvious , unlike in the anomalous hall effect and spin hall effect for electrons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , an understanding of the origin of the observed phe is a fundamental problem .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , there have been a few theoretical attempts to explain the phe  @xcite . refs .   and assumed a raman - type interaction between the spin of stoichiometric tb@xmath3 ions and the phonon . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction results in elliptically polarized  phonons . according to , the elliptic polarization  , in combination with scattering from impurities , leads to the phe . in this scenario </S>",

    "<S> the major problem with this scenario was realized in ref .   - in spite of the elliptic polarization  the born approximation does not result in the phe . </S>",

    "<S> an intrinsic mechanism for the phe , based on the berry curvature of phonon bands , was suggested in ref .  . </S>",

    "<S> there is an important experimental observation which was missed in all the previous theoretical analyses of the phe - tgg crystals can be grown by the flux method ( tgg@xmath6 ) , and by the czochralski method ( tgg@xmath7 ) . </S>",

    "<S> k the diagonal thermal conductivity of tgg@xmath7 is about 5 times smaller than that of tgg@xmath6  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the phe has only been observed in tgg@xmath7  @xcite . </S>",
