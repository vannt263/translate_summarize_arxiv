    "the mechanism of electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is still not known and until there is experimental observation of the scalar higgs boson , the generation of masses for the @xmath13 and @xmath3 bosons , and the fermions , will remain a mystery .",
    "if the mechanism that generates fermion masses is to be related to the ewsb , the interaction of the top quark , with a mass of @xmath14gev @xcite ( the same order as the ewsb scale @xmath15gev ) , may reveal information on the ewsb sector .",
    "in this work we update the constraints on dimension four anomalous couplings of the top quark with the gauge bosons by comparing the recent nlo calculation of the @xmath16 decay rate with the most recent cleo and lep / slc data .",
    "furthermore , given that the forward - backward asymmetries of @xmath17 measured at lep and slc show a @xmath18 deviation from the sm prediction , we study the possibility of these anomalous couplings to explain such deviations .",
    "the deviations from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings are considered in the context of the non - linear electroweak chiral lagrangian , which is the most general effective lagrangian that can describe decoupled or non - decoupled new physics effects @xcite . assuming no new physics effects in the neutral current bottom quark couplings , there are four coefficients that measure the deviation from the sm third family quark ( top @xmath19 and bottom @xmath20 ) and gauge boson ( @xmath21 and @xmath3 ) couplings , they are defined as follows @xcite : @xmath22 in the above equation @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 parameterize possible deviations from the sm predictions  @xcite .",
    "( @xmath27 denotes a top quark with left - handed chirality , etc . ) in general , the charged current coefficients can be complex with the imaginary part introducing a cp odd interaction .",
    "the decay process @xmath16 depends on the real and imaginary parts of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , although the contribution from @xmath28 is suppressed by @xmath30 .",
    "previous analysis of their allowed values have shown that these couplings could be large , even of order @xmath31 , but in a correlated manner @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn from the partial wave unitarity bounds @xcite . in this update",
    "we show that the correlation has become so tight that even a deviation of the sm @xmath0 coupling of order @xmath32 would require a similar deviation for the @xmath1 couplings in order to be consistent with the lep / slc data .",
    "the latest measurement of the @xmath16 branching ratio ( br ) by cleo collaboration @xcite gives ^exp ( bx_s ) & = & 3.15 0.35^stat 0.41^sys , [ bsgaexp ] + & & 2.1 _ 2.7 , where @xmath34 is the energy of the decay photon .",
    "it is roughly a @xmath35 reduction in the error and a @xmath36 shifted mean value , which is closer to the sm prediction , as compared with the 1995 result @xcite .",
    "there has also been an improvement in the sm prediction , in which the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections have been calculated to reduce the renormalization scale dependence @xcite .",
    "using the recent nlo calculation we can write the branching ratio in terms of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 coefficients at the scale of @xmath13 boson mass @xmath39@xcite : ( bx_s ) 10 ^ 4 & & = 1.355 - 6.67 ( c_7(m_w))- 1.22 ( c_8(m_w ) ) + & & + 5.79 |c_7(m_w)|^2 + 0.3|c_8(m_w)|^2 + & & + 2.75 ( c_7(m_w ) c^*_8(m_w ) ) , [ bsgral ] where the numerical factors were obtained using the pole masses of top and bottom quarks as @xmath40gev , @xmath41gev , and the strong coupling at the @xmath3-mass scale to be @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , the energy of the decay photon is required to be larger than @xmath43 with @xmath44 , which corresponds to the experimental cut of the photon energy range . in eq .",
    "( [ bsgral ] ) , the magnetic and chromomagnetic dipole coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 are sensitive to the @xmath0 coupling . at one loop level , they receive contributions from the type of new physics listed in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) as @xcite : c_7 ( m_w ) & = & - ( 1 + ) + & + & , + c_8 ( m_w ) & = & - ( 1 + ) + & + & .",
    "hence , the @xmath16 branching ratio predicted by the effective theory ( [ lagrangian ] ) is : ( bx_s ) 10 ^ 4 = 3.07 + 280 ( ) + 2 ( ) + 5520 | |^2 + + 0.3 | |^2 + 79 ( ( ) ( ) + ( ) ( ) ) .",
    "[ bsgabr ] it is important to note that the coefficients of the terms proportional to @xmath28 are at least two orders of magnitude smaller than their @xmath29 counterparts . roughly speaking , only very high values of @xmath28 ( of order 1 ) would give a significant contribution .",
    "from the theoretical standpoint we do nt expect such extreme possibility to occur because new physics effect would likely modify the anomalous couplings at loop level , hence , at the order of @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "for this reason , from now on we will restrict the possible values of @xmath28 to be at most 0.2 , and drop quadratic terms such as the ones in eq .",
    "( [ bsgabr ] ) .    from the above results",
    ", we can use the recent result  ( [ bsgaexp ] ) from cleo to set limits on the real and imaginary parts of @xmath29 as : -.0035 & & ( ) + 20 ||^2 0.0039 , [ eqbsga ] where , the @xmath4 deviation , that corresponds closely to @xmath47 cl , was used . since the coefficient of the quadratic term , which contains the contribution from im(@xmath29 ) , is 20 times higher than that of the single re(@xmath29 ) , we could imagine a case in which very high values ( of order @xmath48 , for instance ) of the imaginary part would give a large contribution which could be counter balanced by another large and negative contribution from the real part .",
    "such a situation in which the cp violating coupling would be one order of magnitude bigger than the cp even real part is very unusual , though possible . in fig .",
    "[ krcbounds ] , we display the correlated allowed region for re(@xmath29 ) and im(@xmath29 ) defined inside the solid lines . as to be discussed below , im(@xmath29 ) can be better probed with other experimental observables . as for the information already given by the branching ratio of @xmath16",
    ", we conclude that at the @xmath4 level |()| 0.4 10 ^ -2 .",
    "a non - vanishing im(@xmath29 ) would signal a cp - violation effect .",
    "what do we know about this cp - violating @xmath0 anomalous coupling ? so far , there is only one experimental measurement that gives us some information on im(@xmath29 ) , and that is the @xmath49 branching ratio itself . as presented in eq .",
    "( [ bsgabr ] ) this branching ratio is already sensitive to a cp violating coupling , and some constraining region can be already set for im(@xmath29 ) as is shown in fig .",
    "[ krcbounds ] . on the other hand",
    ", there can be another observable of the @xmath50 process that can be used to measure cp violation in the @xmath0 coupling .",
    "the following asymmetry has been proposed to measure cp violation contained in the @xmath51 coefficients @xcite : @xmath52 +     a_{87}(\\delta)\\,\\mbox{im}\\!\\left [ \\frac{c_8}{c_7 } \\right ]    + a_{28}(\\delta)\\,\\frac{\\mbox{im}[c_2 c_8^*]}{|c_7|^2 }   \\ , , \\label{acp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given at scale @xmath30 .",
    "as before , there is a dependence on the energy range of the photon .",
    "following ref .",

    "again , we can simplify the above equation by neglecting terms with @xmath28 ; here too , the numerical coefficients of @xmath28 are much smaller than those of @xmath29 terms .",
    "we find that @xmath58    notice that indeed this asymmetry is quite sensitive to @xmath59 which is consistent with the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite that left - right symmetric models can give large contribution to the asymmetry @xmath60 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ krcbounds ] , this asymmetry can set very strong constraints on im(@xmath29 ) .",
    "for instance , if @xmath61 proves to be smaller than @xmath62 , it would mean im(@xmath29 ) less than @xmath63 .",
    "what about im(@xmath28 ) ?",
    "as shown above , the @xmath33 process does not make a good probe of the left - handed cp - odd @xmath0 coupling .",
    "nevertheless , there are other b - decay processes with a good potential to measure im(@xmath28 ) in future b factories . for instance , the hadronic channels @xmath64 and @xmath65 have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite for b factories .",
    "we shall not discuss it further in this paper .",
    "the validity of the sm at the electroweak loop level has been established with a very high precision in the recent ( and almost final ) results from lep and slac @xcite . except for the forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath66 ) of the b - quark and the total left - right asymmetry ( @xmath5 ) of @xmath67 ,",
    "there is a @xmath68 or better agreement with the experimental data . in the light of the remarkable experimental achievement given by the accuracy of the measurements , and also the degree of precision in the sm predictions ,",
    "this agreement would impose strong limits on the anomalous couplings of the effective lagrangian in ( [ lagrangian ] ) . in principle , the low energy effective theory can be applied to describe an underlying new physics dynamics with or without a higgs boson , for simplicity , we assume that there exists a sm - like higgs boson with mass of 70gev , which brings the sm predictions to an optimum agreement with the data @xcite , and concentrate on the effect from the anomalous couplings of the top quark .",
    "we first consider all the data that is consistent with the sm prediction within @xmath69 , and use them to constrain the allowed values of the anomalous @xmath70 terms in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) at the @xmath4 level .",
    "then , we discuss the possible predictions on @xmath66 and @xmath5 produced by the constrained @xmath70 s .",
    "there are two observables of @xmath3-pole physics that are particularly sensitive to top quark couplings as they are proportional to the top quark mass .",
    "these are the @xmath71 parameter , and the @xmath20-@xmath20-@xmath3 vertex ; directly associated to @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the analysis by altarelli , et .",
    "al @xcite .",
    "the net non - standard contributions to the @xmath74 parameters are    _ 1= ( -+-()^2-()^2+()^2 + 2 ) , [ cal1 ] _",
    "b= ( - ) ( 1 + 2 ) , [ cal2 ] in which only contributions proportional to ( @xmath75 ) are kept @xcite , and the cut - off scale of the effective theory @xmath76 is taken to be @xmath77tev @xcite . note that @xmath28 contributes to @xmath73 up to this order only through the contribution proportional to @xmath78 and @xmath79 ; since we want to consider all possible values ( within @xmath80 ) of @xmath28 we choose to keep it there .",
    "given the above results we can then use the experimental values of the @xmath74 s to constrain the theoretical predictions @xcite : 1.54 10 ^ -3 ^sm_1+_1 5.86 10 ^ -3 , [ cal11 ] + -8.32 10 ^ -3 ^sm_b+_b -0.88 10 ^ -3 , [ cal21 ] where the minimum and maximum limits represent @xmath4 deviations from the central values of the experimental measurements . from ref .",
    "@xcite we recall the sm values for @xmath72 and @xmath73 are : @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath83gev and @xmath84gev .    using the @xmath70 s contribution as well as the sm values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 given above",
    "we obtain the following inequalities : -0.019 & & ( - ) - ( - ) ^2 + + ^2 0.0013 , [ bounds1 ] + -0.33 & & ( - 4 ) ( 1 + 2 ) 0.1 . [ bounds2 ] although the above bounds does not take into account the strong correlation among the possible values of the @xmath74 s , which is described by a 4 dimensional hyperboloid , it is instructive to find out at this level what is the implication from these two bounds . in general , the constraints to the @xmath71 parameter imply an almost linear relation : - .",
    "[ krelation ] the purpose of keeping the quadratic terms in eq .",
    "( [ bounds1 ] ) is to verify that indeed their presence is not significant , provided we do not consider the highly unlikely possibility of very big deviations of the top quark couplings ( above @xmath85 ) .    to improve the above analysis , we have perform a @xmath4 fit of the @xmath70 s to the lep / slc observables , which includes @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xcite , as well as the @xmath100 ratio @xcite .",
    "we find that the linear relation of eq .",
    "( [ krelation ] ) is now very precisely established , as the remarkably narrow allowed regions of @xmath79 and @xmath78 shown in fig .",
    "[ ncbounds ] sharply describe segments of lines with slope equal to 1 . therefore ,",
    "we conclude that the lep / slc data have strongly constrained the anomalous couplings of eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "even though one of them , @xmath28 for instance , can take on any value ( within 0.2 ) , the two other couplings @xmath79 and @xmath78 are constrained to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ krelation ] ) and can not be far off from the value of @xmath28 itself .",
    "let us now consider the three lep / slc observables that show an almost @xmath4 deviation from the sm , namely @xmath66 , @xmath5(hadrons ) and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "could the @xmath0 and @xmath1 anomalous couplings account for these discrepancies ? in fig .",
    "[ assym ] we show the predicted possible values of @xmath5 and @xmath66 for the two values of @xmath101 .",

    "the solid lines define a very narrow region of predicted values coming from the allowed values of the @xmath70 couplings . for @xmath104",

    "inspired by the fact that no satisfactory proven mechanism for the breaking of the electroweak symmetry exists , and the fact that the top quark stands out as much heavier than all the other known elementary particles , we proposed a model in which the @xmath1 and @xmath0 couplings depart from their sm values",
    ". the sm has been highly tested by the reasonably good measurements of rare decay processes , such as @xmath33 , by the cleo collaboration , as well as by the precision data of lep and slc .",
