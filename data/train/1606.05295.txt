    "the notion of lorentzian wormholes ( or morris - thorne wormholes or simply wh ) arose when morris and thorne explored the possibility of time travel for humans using the principles of general relativity ( gr ) @xcite .",
    "einstein s theory of gr predicts that the structure and geometry of spacetime in the presence of matter is not rigid but is elastic and deformable .",
    "the more compact the object is , the more strong the curvature of space is , which essentially leads to the idea of black holes .",
    "however in the later case , the fabric of spacetime loses its meaning at the curvature singularity . if somehow the formation of singularity is avoided than it would be possible to travel in and out of the throat , so that there is no restriction to observer s motion on the manifold .",
    "the possibility of such solution to the einstein field equations was for the first time explored by flamm @xcite recently after the discovery of the gr , but it was later shown that his solution was unstable .",
    "first more detailed analysis of the wormhole solution was done later by einstein and rosen @xcite .",
    "a typical wormhole is a tube - like structure which is asymptotically flat from both sides .",
    "the radius of the wormhole s throat could be a constant or variable depending on its construction and is termed static or non - static respectively .",
    "gr predicts that to form a wh , an exotic form of matter ( violating the energy conditions ) must be present near the throat of the wh .",
    "the problem is the dearth of a reasonable source that sustains the wormhole geometry .",
    "one possible candidate is the phantom energy ( which is a cosmic dynamical scalar field with negative kinetic energy in its lagrangian ) and is the primed candidate of explaining cosmic accelerated expansion as well @xcite .",
    "since the existence of phantom energy is questionable and no other suitable exotic matter candidate is available , an alternative approach is commonly followed : investigation if the modifications of laws of gravity ( i.e. gr ) , proposed primarily for explanation of accelerated expansion and avoiding singularities , can support the wh geometries .",
    "since the wh is a non - vacuum solution of einstein field equations , the presence of some form of energy - matter is necessary to construct a wh . in the framework of modified gravity",
    ", the matter content is assumed to satisfy the energy conditions near the wh s throat , while the higher curvature correction terms in the lagrangian are required to sustain the wh geometry .    in recent years",
    ", theories of modified gravity have got enormous attention to model cosmic accelerated expansion ; explaining flat rotation curves of galaxies ; wormhole formation and other esoteric phenomenon near black holes @xcite .",
    "a well - known theory of modified gravity is the @xmath0 gravity , where @xmath3 is the ricci scalar .",
    "simple idea on which this theory is based is generalizing the integral of action for gr , so that the ricci curvature scalar is replaced by some arbitrary function , @xmath0 .",
    "field equations obtained in this fashion have higher degree of complexity , and admit richer set of solutions than the standard gr .",
    "harko and collaborators @xcite constructed solutions of static wormholes threaded by ordinary matter ( satisfying the energy conditions ) in @xmath0 gravity , whereby the curvature / gravitational fluid supports the nonstandard wormhole geometries . note that the gravitational fluid can not be considered as exotic .",
    "debenedictis and collaborators also obtained new static wormhole solutions in the power - law @xmath4 gravity @xcite .",
    "rahaman et al @xcite obtained new static wormholes in @xmath0 theory using the non - commutative geometry .",
    "it was also demonstrated that viable @xmath0 theories of gravity , obtained by demanding the consistency with observational data for the solar system and cosmological evolution , admit existence of wormhole solutions that do not require exotic matter @xcite",
    ". additionally , in @xcite it was found a traversable wormhole solution in the framework of mimetic @xmath0 gravity . besides",
    ", the static wormhole geometries have also been theorized within curvature - matter coupling theories such as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the trace of stress - energy - momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "additionally , wormhole geometries have also been explored in generalized teleparallel gravity @xcite , gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite and lovelock - brans - dicke gravity @xcite .",
    "in addition , wormholes minimally coupled to pions supported by a negative cosmological constant were obtained in ref .",
    "spherically symmetric evolving wormholes were studied in the context of standard gr in @xcite , and similar analysis was also extended to the case of rotating axially symmetric wormholes in gr @xcite .",
    "it was later shown that the violation of the null energy condition is also necessary in non - symmetric and time - dependent wormholes @xcite .",
    "some specific solutions for dynamical wormholes were also investigated in @xmath0 gravity @xcite , as well as @xmath7 theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "it was recently proposed by rahaman and collaborators that galactic halo posses some of the characteristics needed to support traversable wormholes @xcite , which was followed by the discussion on possibility of their detection @xcite .",
    "if these galactic wormholes exist it is natural to assume that they would be produced in the early universe , and therefore question of their properties and evolution during the expansion of the universe naturally arises . in any case , even if these proposed galactic wormholes do not exist , investigation of wormholes in the cosmological context is interesting topic in its own right .",
    "therefore , we are curious in the construction of evolving wh in @xmath0 gravity , in the framework of standard cosmological assumptions . by construction ,",
    "the evolving wh metric is similar to the flrw metric , hence the wh expands as the universe expands .",
    "the wh spacetime is threaded by anisotropic matter which asymptotically becomes isotropic , so to match usual description of cosmological ideal fluid . since the isotropicity about every point in spacetime implies homogeneity ( but not vice versa ) , the matter distribution is also homogeneous asymptotically .",
    "the asymptotic limit may correspond to the cosmological horizon , but it could also be much smaller than the horizon in the limit of a small wormhole - with geometry approaching friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) on some small distance from the wormhole throat .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we give an overview of the @xmath0 theory and its field equations for the static wormhole geometry . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce the cosmological wormholes in @xmath0 gravity . in sec .",
    "iv , we numerically solve the wormhole equations for radiation and matter era and then we analyse the energy conditions .",
    "finally we give the conclusion in sec .",
    "v. we work with units @xmath8 and use the signature @xmath9 .",
    "the action in @xmath0 gravity reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the lagrangian density for the matter and @xmath0 is a smooth function which depends on the scalar curvature .",
    "we can notice that if we set @xmath2 we recover the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "+ by varying this action with respect to the metric we find @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the energy - momentum tensor of the matter .",
    "+ the morris - thorne metric which can describe the space - time of a static wormhole is given by @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the redshift function and @xmath18 is a shape function , which are both functions of radial coordinate , @xmath19 . in the wormhole geometry ,",
    "radial coordinate needs to non - monotonically decrease from infinity to a minimal value @xmath20 at the throat , where @xmath21 , and then increase to infinity . although metric is singular at @xmath22 , proper distance as an invariant quantity must be well behaved , and therefore the following integral must be real and regular outside the throat , @xmath23 and from this one obtains the condition @xmath24 far from the throat , space must be asymptotically flat which implies the condition @xmath25 as @xmath26 . by definition ,",
    "throat represent the minimum radius in this wormhole geometry and this leads to the flaring - out condition @xcite , @xmath27 hereafter , prime denotes derivative with respect to the argument of a function , so that @xmath28 .",
    "it is also assumed that wormhole has no horizons , so that it can be traversable and for this reason @xmath17 must be finite everywhere . as already mentioned in the introduction , static wormholes in einstein s general relativity require exotic fluid , i.e. fluid which is violating standard condition on stress - energy tensor , weak energy condition ( wec ) .",
    "this condition is given by @xmath29 for any spacelike vector @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "apart from construction of cosmological wormholes in @xmath0 gravity , we will also be interested in whether this wormholes , that could be produced in the early universe and be determined by its dynamics , could satisfy wec or not .",
    "moreover , we will also consider the limit @xmath2 as a comparison .",
    "static wormhole geometry ( [ morristhorne ] ) can easily be generalised to the evolving case , @xmath31\\ , , \\label{metrika}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the scale factor which controls the dynamic of the wormhole . since parameters @xmath18 and @xmath33",
    "determine the geometrical properties of the wormhole , we will naturally demand that they obey the same conditions as in the static case with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we can notice that if we set @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we recover the static morris - thorne metric ( [ morristhorne ] ) .",
    "in addition , for an observer far away from the throat of the wormhole we demand that @xmath38 and @xmath39 fast enough , so that for the large enough distances the metric converts to the flrw one . in other words ,",
    "this metrics allows wormhole solutions to be approximately embedded in flrw universes .",
    "this geometry is clearly not asymptotically - flat , and therefore we here use somehow extended definition of a wormhole which does not imply asymptotic flatness . in any case",
    ", this implies only generalization of the wormhole s asymptotic behavior , and makes no changes in the throat properties , which is the most interesting and fundamental attribute of a wormhole .",
    "related question of formal definitions regarding dynamical wormholes , including wormholes which are asymptotically flrw , was previously discussed in @xcite .",
    "we can choose a radius @xmath40 for all times ( where @xmath41 is the cosmological hubble parameter ) such that if we take some @xmath42 , the redshift and shape function can be neglected and we can approximately treat the wormhole as confined within the region @xmath43 with no influence on the global geometry of flrw space - time .",
    "therefore , we can demand that the dynamical properties of this wormhole , apart from the evolution of the red - shift function , are determined only by the expansion of the universe , so that the scale factor @xmath32 is equal in both regions .",
    "we can call this approximate geometry - where @xmath44 can be effectively treated as a wormhole s asymptotic infinity - a small cosmological wormhole .",
    "objects like this could be created on the microscopical scales in the early universe and then subsequently enlarged during expansion of the universe .",
    "for instance , if such wormholes were created at or before the electroweak scale their physical size @xmath45 should be much less than a centimetre , a typical scale of the hubble radius at that time . by the end of matter dominated era such wormholes",
    "would then be characterized by the typical size of astrophysical objects .",
    "thus , on the cosmological scales , the energy - momentum tensor is represented with an isotropic ideal fluid with equation of state @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the state parameter and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the energy density and pressure of the cosmological fluid respectively . here , index @xmath50 denotes that we are dealing with functions on the cosmological scales of flrw metric to distinguish them from the components of the anisotropic energy momentum tensor defined in the region @xmath43 , which we will denote with the subscript `` @xmath51 '' .",
    "+ if we use the conservation law for the energy - momentum tensor for the cosmological fluid , @xmath52 , we find that the energy density of this fluid is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the current energy density .",
    "it is important to mention that in both regions @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the form of @xmath0 should naturally be the identical . + the @xmath0 field equations ( [ f(r)eq ] ) for the cosmological flat flrw spacetime ( @xmath42 region ) yield @xmath55 - 3h(t)\\dot{r_{c}}f_{rr}+\\rho_{c}(t)\\big)\\ , , \\label{mod.friedman}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the scalar curvature of the flat flrw spacetime , @xmath57 and dots represent differentiation with respect to the cosmic time .",
    "in the region @xmath43 , matter supporting the wormhole will be an anisotropic fluid such as the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the energy density , radial pressure and lateral pressure respectively .",
    "it follows that for an anisotropic fluid , wec is given by the conditions @xmath62 the @xmath0 field equations ( [ f(r)eq ] ) in this region ( @xmath43 ) for the non - static metric ( [ metrika ] ) are given by @xmath63+\\displaystyle\\frac{f_{rr}}{2r^2a^2}\\big[2 r ( r - b(r ) ) r''-\\left(r \\left(b'(r)-4\\right)+3 b(r)\\right ) r'-6 r^2 a \\dot{a}\\dot{r}e^{-2 \\phi}\\big]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{3 f_{r } e^{-2 \\phi}}{a } \\left(\\ddot{a}-\\dot{a } \\dot{\\phi}\\right)\\,,\\label{fieldeq1a}\\\\ p_{r}&=&-\\frac{1}{2}f+\\frac{b(r)f_{r}}{2r^3a^2}\\big[2 r^2 \\phi'^2 + 2 r^2 \\phi''-r \\phi'-2\\big]+\\frac{e^{-2 \\phi}f_{r}}{2r^2a^2}\\big[e^{2 \\phi } \\big(b'(r ) \\big(r \\phi'+2\\big)\\nonumber\\\\ & & -2 r^2 \\big(\\phi'^2+\\phi''\\big)\\big)+4 r^2 \\dot{a}^2\\big]+\\frac{f_{r } e^{-2 \\phi}}{a } \\left(\\ddot{a}-\\dot{a } \\dot{\\phi}\\right)-e^{-2 \\phi } f_{rrr } \\dot{r}^2\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{f_{rr}r'}{a^2}\\left(1-\\frac{b(r)}{r}\\right)\\left(\\phi'+\\frac{2}{r}\\right)+\\frac{e^{-2\\phi}f_{rr}}{a}\\big[a \\left(\\dot{r}\\dot{\\phi}-\\ddot{r}\\right)-2 \\dot{a } \\dot{r}\\big]\\,,\\label{fieldeq1b}\\\\ p_{l}&=&-\\frac{1}{2}f+\\frac{f_{r}}{2 r^3 a^2}\\big[b(r)\\left(2 r \\phi'+1\\right)+\\left(b'(r)-2 r \\phi'\\right)r \\big]+\\frac{e^{-2\\phi}f_{r}}{2a^2}\\big[4   \\dot{a}^2 + 2 a \\left(\\ddot{a}-\\dot{a } \\dot{\\phi}\\right)\\big]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + f_{rrr}\\big[\\frac{r'^2}{a^2}\\big(1-\\frac{b(r)}{r}\\big)-\\dot{r}^2 e^{-2 \\phi}\\big]+\\frac{f_{rr}}{2r^2a^2}\\big[r ' \\left(r \\left(2 r \\phi'-b'(r)+2\\right)-b(r ) \\left(2 r \\phi'+1\\right)\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 2 r ( r - b(r ) ) r''\\big]-\\frac{f_{rr}}{r^3a^2}\\big[4 r^3 a \\dot{a } \\dot{r}-2 r^3 a^2 \\dot{r}\\dot{\\phi}+2 r^3 a^2\\ddot{r}\\big]\\,,\\label{fieldeq1c}\\\\ 2\\big(\\frac{\\dot{a } } { a}\\big)f_{r}\\phi'&=&f_{rrr}\\dot{r}r'-f_{rr}\\big[\\frac{\\dot{a}r'}{a}+\\dot{r } \\phi'-\\dot{r'}\\big]\\ , ,      \\label{fieldeq1d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 , and @xmath3 is the ricci scalar for the evolving wormhole geometry ( [ metrika ] )",
    ". we will also consider the following boundary conditions ( at the boundary @xmath65 ) @xmath66 these conditions imply that the anisotropic fluid supporting the wormhole goes continuously to the isotropic fluid of the universe .",
    "moreover , they also tell us that the density - pressure relationship goes to the cosmological equation of state at @xmath65 , @xmath67 there are four field equations ( [ fieldeq1a])-([fieldeq1d ] ) containing seven unknowns functions , therefore we need to close the system by choosing some ansatz .",
    "hereafter , we will consider that @xmath68 where @xmath69 will be some chosen function which decreases fast to negligible values for @xmath70 .",
    "it is also necessary to prescribe the form of the modified gravity , @xmath0 , which from ( [ mod.friedman ] ) determines @xmath32 and therefore the expansion of the small cosmological wormhole . with special interest in viable wormhole solutions",
    "we will consider choices for @xmath0 which lead to experimentally confirmed @xmath1cdm expansion history of the universe .",
    "thus , this choice of @xmath0 will lead to known forms of @xmath71 in radiation ( @xmath72 ) and matter dominated epoch ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "following the results of this reconstruction procedure we take @xcite @xmath74 during radiation dominated phase , where @xmath75 is the current energy density of matter and @xmath76 is an arbitrary constant . for the matter dominated",

    "in this section , we will consider the evolution of cosmological wormhole during the radiation dominated era , where cosmological perfect fluid is described by the eos parameter @xmath84 , leading to the expansion of the scale factor as @xmath85 .",

    "we first consider the non - diagonal modified einstein s equation ( 13 ) , which is a partial differential equation with respect to @xmath33 ( note that ricci curvature is itself dependent on @xmath33 , so this equation contains derivatives with respect to both the radial and time coordinate , as well as the mixed terms ) . in order to solve this equation",
    "we will solve it at the throat , @xmath22 , and assume that the same time dependence will remain valid for all other positions .",
    "this is consistent with the approximation that @xmath33 goes fast to zero for @xmath95 , so that only important region is that in the vicinity of the throat .",
    "after @xmath96 has been numerically obtained in this manner , it can be used to solve the remaining modified einstein s equation , which represent only algebraic equations for the components of energy - momentum tensor of anisotropic fluid . in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] we show the obtained time evolution and the space dependence of @xmath59 , and check for the possible wec violation related to both pressures : @xmath97 and @xmath98",

    "[ fig7 ] ) as well as the difference between radial and lateral pressure , @xmath100 , as a natural measure of anisotropicity of the fluid ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "one can clearly see that the matter supporting the wormhole goes to the ideal isotropic cosmological fluid with @xmath101 when approaching @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , wec is always satisfied , so there is no need for introducing any form of exotic matter to support the wormhole .",
    "the exoticity parameter @xmath102 describes the physical nature of matter near and far away from the wormhole s throat . if @xmath103 than the matter surrounding the wormhole is exotic ( non - exotic ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig7b ] , it is obvious that @xmath104 for all values of @xmath19 , thus matter ( in this case , radiation ) remains non - exotic and the wormhole is stable even with radiation and do not require exotic matter .    in the region",
    "@xmath42 flat flrw metric is by construction replacing the dynamical wormhole metric to which it is connected , leading to the known solutions that we do not plot here . in the shown plots we choose @xmath105 as a suitable origin , but with the presented conclusions remaining valid for the earlier times after the big bang .",
    "the last issue that then remains to be discussed is the exact numerical establishment of the boundary condition @xmath106 .",
    "this can be achieved by choosing the appropriate values for the free parameters @xmath90,@xmath91 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . since",
    "this adjusting of the free parameters is not very enlightening , for the sake of the simplicity we choose to demonstrate this in a different manner .",
    "we absorb the dependence on the free parameters in a constant term , @xmath109 , which is multiplying our solution for energy density , @xmath110 , obtained with arbitrary set of parameters .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] that with choosing the different constant parameters one obtains the family of curves with the same evolution as the cosmological density , @xmath48 . for a suitable value of @xmath109 curves @xmath110 and",

    "[ fig9 ] ) , we compute the components of energy momentum tensor for matter supporting the considered cosmological wormhole . we depict the time evolution and space dependence of energy density , as well as the sum of energy density and both radial and lateral pressures in fig  [ fig10 ] , fig .  [ fig11 ] and fig .  [ fig12 ] respectively . as similar to the solutions in the radiation domination phase",
    ", there is no wec violation present for the supporting matter during the matter dominated era . in fig .",
    "[ fig13b ] is sketched the exoticity parameter for the matter era .",
    "we can notice a similar behaviour as the previous section since @xmath102 is always negative .",
    "thus , the matter remains non - exotic and hence the wormhole is stable .    from the plot for time evolution of radial eos parameter , @xmath115 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , one can see that it at first approaches @xmath116 , but then goes to the negative values .",
    "this comes from the fact that constant term in the @xmath0 expansion , which effectively describes the cosmological constant , starts to dominate over the matter when approaching @xmath94 .",

    "we demonstrate this with showing @xmath117 for the case when @xmath118 ( see fig .  [ fig14 ] ) , where it is clear that the wormhole eos goes to the cosmological one when there is only matter present .",
    "result depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] furthermore shows that the difference between radial and lateral pressure goes to zero , and therefore wormhole supporting matter approaches the ideal cosmological fluid as the radial coordinate goes to @xmath44 , so that it can be smoothly matched with the flrw universe for @xmath42 . finally , in the same manner as for the radiation domination era",

    "this is also confirmed in the cosmological solutions we obtain .",
    "taking the special case of standard gr , wormhole solutions can not in general be supported by considered anisotropic ideal fluid represented by only diagonal components of energy - momentum tensor . in order to solve the off - diagonal field equation ( [ fieldeq1d ] ) in the case of general dynamic wormhole",

    "off - diagonal equation now reads : @xmath120 this means that the wec , @xmath121 , will now also include this energy flux : @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 we again take @xmath89 , but now we also have the freedom to prescribe @xmath96 . since @xmath32 defines the natural time scale of the system under consideration it seems natural to take @xmath125 .",

    "[ fig6gr]@xmath126[fig7gr ] .",
    "one can see that in the case of standard general relativity our solutions lead to the wec violation .",
    "therefore , an important difference between einstein s gr and cosmologically viable reconstructed @xmath0 theory lies in the fact that only later admits wormhole solution supported by regular matter during the whole period of matter and radiation domination .",
    "discussion on the possible existence of wormholes as astrophysical objects naturally leads to the question of their properties and evolution during the expansion of the universe .",
    "we speculate that cosmological wormholes could be created in the conditions characterizing the early universe plasma , and then subsequently evolve during the radiation and matter dominance epoch . in order to describe wormholes in a cosmological context",
    "it is necessary to match evolving wormhole geometry with the flrw space - time . in the present work this was achieved by using the approximation of a small wormhole - where geometry is determined by requirement that for some radial distance away from the throat of the wormhole , @xmath44 , shape and red - shift functions become so small that they can be taken to vanish , therefore enabling wormhole matching to the flrw geometry .",
    "when approaching @xmath44 , anisotropic fluid supporting the wormhole needs to go to the ideal isotropic fluid of the universe , with equation of state parameter going to the one characterizing radiation and matter dominance epoch respectively .",
    "+   + our analysis was done in the framework of @xmath0 modified gravity , which is of special interest for several reasons : it represents a simple and natural mathematical generalization of standard gr , it does not introduce any new physical assumptions or entities , it is capable of describing observed accelerated expansion of the universe , and avoiding singularities which appear in the standard gr .",
    "interested in viable cosmological solutions we choose the form of @xmath127 functions given by the reconstruction procedure , which leads to the known evolution of cosmological scale factor .",
    "we considered the wormhole solutions that were described by the same scale factor as the universe - i.e. that had its dynamics determined by the expansion of the universe .",
    "choosing simple functions for shape parameter and space - dependent part of red - shift function we constructed examples of cosmological wormhole solutions in radiation and matter dominance epoch .",
    "it was demonstrated that there is no wec violation for material supporting these wormholes , while in the @xmath2 limit wec will always be violated in both epochs .",
    "such cosmological wormholes could then be created as a microscopic objects in the early universe , and then increase their size during the evolution of the universe , until they reach the size of average astrophysical objects today .",
    "+   + in this paper , we have focused on the evolution of wormhole in the radiation and dominated phases of the universe . working withing the @xmath0 framework we assume that dark energy is effectively described by modification of the action for the gr . if the universe is dominated by some form of exotic matter such as phantom energy , than phantom wormholes within @xmath0 theory would be of theoretical interest as well . +   + presented investigation of cosmological wormholes opens many potential questions for further work .",
    "it would be important to extend the analysis to the era of inflation and late time expansion , described by the scale factor exponentially dependent on time .",
    "another interesting direction would be to look for evolving wormhole construction within the curvature - matter coupling models with actions such as @xmath128 or @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "moreover thermodynamic aspects of such wormholes at their apparent or event horizons along with further extensions to higher dimensions would be of some interest too .",
    "feature of special physical interest would be to discuss astrophysical properties and possibility of detection for discussed solutions , as well as their interaction with surrounding matter - for instance via accretion of different material on the cosmological wormholes .",

    "<S> * abstract : * motivated by recent proposals of possible wormhole existence in galactic halos , we analyse the cosmological evolution of wormhole solutions in modified @xmath0 gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a dynamical wormhole that asymptotically approaches flrw universe , with supporting material going to the perfect isotropic fluid described by the equation of state for radiation and matter dominated universe respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on an approximation of a small wormhole - a wormhole that can be treated as matched with the flrw metric at some radial coordinate much smaller than the hubble radius , so that cosmological boundary conditions are satisfied . with a special interest in viable wormhole solutions </S>",
    "<S> , we refer to the results of reconstruction procedure and use @xmath0 functions which lead to the experimentally confirmed @xmath1cdm expansion history of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> solutions we find imply no need for exotic matter near the throat of considered wormholes , while in the limit of @xmath2 this need is always present during radiation and matter dominated epoch . + * keywords * : wormholes ; @xmath0 theory of gravity ; @xmath1cdm universe </S>"
