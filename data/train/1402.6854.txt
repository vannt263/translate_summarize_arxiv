    "the phase space is the conceptually natural setting of quantum mechanics , more so in the setting of its explicit correspondence to classical mechanics , _ the semiclassical regime_. all inherent invariance properties of classical mechanics which become naturally manifest in phase space are reflections of approximate quantum mechanical symmetries , explicit in its phase space representations . also , the problem of caustics ( singularities void of physical content caused by projecting the dynamics to the configuration space ) is resolved since they are not encountered as persistent obstacles toward global solutions in phase space formulations as they do in semiclassical considerations in configuration space .",

    "more recently , rousse and robert @xcite setting off from a ` head down ' direction , assumed a semiclassical time evolution for generic initial data of the schrdinger equation , in terms of a fourier integral operator identified with the herman - kluk propagator , in order to justify this approximation on the basis of rigorous estimates for the asymptotic solutions .",

    "it follows that like time evolution in configuration space , time evolution in phase space is also generated by a unitary group @xmath79 constituting the phase space propagator @xmath70 a unitary quantum flow , in the sense that , on @xmath39 , @xmath80 so that phase space dynamics induced by @xmath70 retain the gaussian ` twisted ' analyticity of the initial data ( see relations @xmath81 and @xmath82 of the appendix ) .",

    "this reproducing property of the initial propagator is a result of the underlying analytic structure of the fock - bargmann space @xmath39 , something which is elaborated on in the appendix ( subsection @xmath40 of the appendix ) .",
    "in this section we deal with the propagation of gaussian wave packets in configuration space and their phase space image under the wave packet transform . in particular , we consider _ the anisotropic gaussian wave packet _ , following the independent works of heller , huber , littlejohn ( isotropic case ) @xcite and littlejohn @xcite , maslov , shvedov @xcite ( anisotropic case ) and more recently robert @xcite , nazaikinskii , schulze , sternin @xcite , and stoyanovsky @xcite .",
    "an excellent account of the subject , masterfully touching upon its dynamical and algebraic aspects , is given by littlejohn @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , the semiclassical dynamics of anisotropic gaussian wave packets in configuration space realizes a representation of the metaplectic group on the siegel upper half space , and is equivalent to the variational system of the hamiltonian flow in the frame of _ the nearby orbit method _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an attempt for the semiclassical description of the dynamics in the position representation has come under the name of _ initial value representations _ , involving superpositions of initial semiclassical states in wave packets , @xmath104 , propagating them in a certain approximation along the hamiltonian orbits @xmath24 eminating from @xmath6 ( see introduction ) , and then superposing the evolved wave packets back together , with respect to _ all _ initial phase space points @xmath6 .",
    "here we consider _ the anisotropic gaussian wave packet approximation _ , in order to construct a semiclassical propagator for the phase space schrdinger equation .",
    "the leading term in the semiclassical propagation of a single normalized isotropic gaussian wave packet , amounts to the anisotropic gaussian approximation , namely @xmath105 retaining its gaussian form , yet acquiring an anisotropic phase .",
    "in particular , in this approximation , the initial state @xmath106 is evolved semiclassically to the anisotropic gaussian wave packet moving along the ray @xmath107 , and semiclassically concentrated on that point on the heisenberg scale @xcite . in particular , we consider the following ansatz @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a real valued phase , and the matrix @xmath110 is symmetric and has positive definite imaginary part , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , to be determined by the dynamics .    by substituting the ansatz ( @xmath113 ) in the schrdinger equation , and demanding that it be an asymptotic solution , in the sense that for a certain time scale and uniformly in @xmath114 , @xmath115 we arrive at a system of characteristic differential equations along the orbit @xmath24 @xcite , analogous to the wkbm system ; the zeroth order equation in @xmath116 is @xmath117 along with the initial condition @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the phase space lagrangian of the flow .",

    "this choice of phase actually has a nontrivial algebraic content ; the double valuedness of the square root of the determinant reflects the double valuedness of the covering mapping @xmath210 , and thus choice of branch is actualy a choice of a specific metaplectic transformation .    in order to verify the invariance of gaussian form under @xmath201 ,",
    "as noted by folland @xcite , i.e. , that wave packets in configuration space are mapped into wave packets in phase space , one must bring the above in the form of a gaussian with a siegel quadratic form in @xmath6 , rather than in @xmath155 .",
    "the auxiliary mapping @xmath211 , which will serve in defining the phase space anisotropy form as will be shown , is an action of the metaplectic group on @xmath171 , and its image is a submanifold of the open siegel upper half disk @xmath212 , @xmath213 and is actually identified with the open ball in the matrix norm topology , @xmath214 the closed ball is the image of the compactified siegel half space , @xmath215 , extending it by the real symmetric matrices ( the boundary ) and the point at infinity .",
