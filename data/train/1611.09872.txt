    "evaluation of the transport coefficients for coupled plasmas is greatly complicated by the many - body physics of particle collisions .",
    "the recently proposed effective potential theory ( ept ) addresses this issue by stipulating that , as far as transport is concerned , collisions can be considered effectively binary even at finite coupling , with the many - body physics manifesting itself solely through modifying the interaction potential between the two colliding particles  @xcite . in turn , the effective potential enters expressions for the transport coefficients through the so - called  generalized coulomb logarithms \" , which are closely related to the standard gas - kinetic cross sections .",
    "the resulting transport predictions for a one component plasma ( ocp ) prove in a remarkable agreement with molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , encouraging extension of the ept concept to the case of a plasma with multiple ion species .",
    "while kinetic calculations for multi - component systems are more complex , the problem is well explored in the literature on diluted gas mixtures . in this note we summarize the existing transport results in the form convenient for practical use .",
    "local transport formalisms for systems with binary collisions assume that the distribution function @xmath0 of a given species @xmath1 weakly deviates from equilibrium , @xmath2 , due to the knudsen number @xmath3 being small , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the characteristic mean free path and background scale , respectively .",
    "the linearized boltzmann equation is solved for @xmath6 whose moments give transport coefficients of interest .",
    "in the commonly used chapman - enskog approach , the solution for @xmath6 is obtained by expanding it over a set of orthogonal polynomials of the particle velocity @xmath7 .",
    "accordingly , precision of the resulting transport coefficients is governed by the number @xmath8 of the so - called sonyne polynomials kept in the expansion over the radial component of the velocity .",
    "following earlier works we will denote the approximation level , in which transport quantity @xmath9 is evaluated , by @xmath10_{\\xi}$ ] .",
    "transport calculations based on grad s method use different precision nomenclature , but it is straightforward to observe that the orthogonal polynomials employed there are the same and therefore local transport results are identical to those obtained with the chapman - enskog approach . in particular , grad s 21n results by zhdanov  @xcite , in chapman - enskog s nomenclature correspond to @xmath11 for the heat and diffusive fluxes and @xmath12 for viscosity .",
    "one difference between the neutral gas mixtures and unmagnetized plasmas with multiple ion species is presence of electrons .",
    "due to their small mass the energy exchange between them and ions is much slower than equilibration within them or any of the ion species .",
    "consequently , electron temperature should generally be distinguished in fluid plasma models .",
    "also , in a vast range of scenarios plasmas are quasi - neutral and so , if @xmath13 were the total number of plasma species , there would be only @xmath14 independent species concentrations as opposed to @xmath15 in an @xmath13-component gas mixture .",
    "however , these issues can be easily circumvented by considering separately the two subsystems : all the ion species ( ionic mixture ) on the one hand and electrons on the other hand , which interact through collisions and fields .",
    "evaluation of the ion transport then reduces to the classical problem of a mixture under external forces , making it possible to use the well - established prescriptions from the conventional kinetic theory of diluted gases .    accordingly , in what follows we let @xmath13 denote the number of the ion species and exploit results from various sources obtained with either chapman - enskog  @xcite or grad  @xcite methods .",
