    "the study of grain boundaries of ybco is very important , because they act as strong barriers to current flow in ybco @xcite .",
    "this behavior of high temperature superconductors is in sharp contrast to metallic low temperature superconductors , in which grain boundaries are not only transparent to current , but also significantly contribute to flux pinning .",
    "the formation of such weak links in high temperature superconductors is due to the low carrier density and strong dependence of @xmath4 on hole concentration .",
    "there are many experiments showing that the critical current density through grain boundaries is very sensitive to the orientation of the adjacent crystallines @xcite .",
    "generally , a large misorientation angle will reduce @xmath5 significantly .",
    "as we know , there are quite rich phenomena occurring in grain boundaries : variations in the chemical stoichiometry , dissociation of grain boundary dislocations , impurity segregation , etc . for instance , recently kung et al @xcite report that small angle [ 001 ] tilt grain boundaries in ybco with ( 110 ) planes exhibit partial grain boundary dislocations separated by stacking faults .",
    "the dissociated grain boundary structures have twice the number of grain boundary dislocations and shorter interdislocation core channel widths than frank s geometry rule predicts ( in frank s rule the separation between dislocations of small angle @xmath6 boundaries is proportional to @xmath7 ) .",
    "this requires further development of the above model of supercurrent flow through arrays of small angle grain boundaries .",
    "furthermore , the situation gets more complicated because grain boundaries can also act as sinks and sources for vacancies .",
    "in ionic solids this can give rise to charging effects .",
    "the existence of space charge regions near free surfaces in an ionic solid was first postulated by frenkel @xcite . in an ionic solid ,",
    "the vacancy concentrations at surfaces and grain boundaries are determined by the individual free energy of formation .",
    "the cation and anion vacancies usually have different formation energies . however , the vacancy concentrations in the bulk are determined by the condition of charge neutrality and usually they are different from those at the grain boundaries where strict charge neutrality conditions are relaxed .",
    "thus , the vacancy concentration changes as a function of distance from the grain boundaries .",
    "usually , vacancies in ionic solids are charged defects .",
    "spatial distributions of these charged defects lead to a potential difference between the bulk and free surfaces and grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "there are two kinds of space charges . here",
    "we define a space charge arising from differences in point defect formation energies as  intrinsic space charge \" to contrast with those due to segregated dopants and grain boundary nonstoichiometries .",
    "the topic of space charges at interfaces arising from point defects has not been investigated so far for cuprates .",
    "since holes carry a charge , it is expected that a space charge will produce a significant effect on hole distributions around grain boundaries for the metallic phase of @xmath8 .",
    "actually the holes can segregate around charged boundaries even if not metallic .",
    "these can be localized hole distributions .",
    "the generic phase diagram of the cuprates shows a wide variety of different behaviour at different temperatures and levels of doping @xcite . at zero doping the cuprates are all insulators , and below a few hundred kelvin they are also antiferromagnets ( i.e. the electron spins on neighbouring copper ions point in opposite directions ) .",
    "however , when the doping is increased above a critical value ( about @xmath9 , although this varies from compound to compound ) , the antiferromagnetic state disappears and we enter the so - called underdoped region . as the doping is increased further , superconducting region is reached . for @xmath8 , the doping",
    "is closely related to the oxygen content . here",
    "we examine two limits : @xmath10 . when @xmath11 , this is an insulator , which can be approximately treated as an ionic solid .",
    "however , when @xmath12 , the phase is superconducting , and has mobile holes .",
    "the existence of holes can add more screening than in the insulator case .",
    "this is quite similar to the two limits of semiconductors : point defect limit and electron / hole limit . as the oxygen content changes from o@xmath2 to o@xmath3",
    ", the c - axis expands @xcite .",
    "the lattice strain has a large effect on point defects @xcite .",
    "besides , the valence of chain copper ions decreases from + 2 to + 1 as the oxygen content is reduced .",
    "both factors lead to a dramatic change of point defect formation energies in 123 compounds .",
    "consequently , this will affect the intrinsic space charge .",
    "it has been known since the early days of ybco that doping with calcium is one way of adding more holes to the material .",
    "divalent calcium is roughly the same size as trivalent yttrium and so readily replaces it .",
    "if a deficiency of holes causes grain boundaries to have weak coupling , then the critical current might be improved by doping calcium into grain boundaries .",
    "note that if calcium is doped inside the bulk as well , the bulk @xmath4 will be lowered .",
    "therefore , doping calcium at the grain boundaries can both repair transport properties of grain boundaries and keep the high @xmath4 value of the bulk . indeed ,",
    "hammerl et al @xcite recently developed one beautiful process to increase the critical current density above @xmath13 at temperatures near the boiling point of liquid nitrogen by doping ca into only high angle grain boundaries of ybco .",
    "so , the current key issue is to improve transport properties near low - angle [ 001 ] tilt grain boundaries , which are the main types of defects in polycrystalline ybco wires and tapes @xcite . for small angle grain boundaries , gurevich et al @xcite argue that the critical current density dependence is mostly determined by the decrease of the current - carrying cross section by insulating dislocation cores and by progressive local suppression of the superconducting order parameter near grain boundaries as @xmath6 increases .",
    "however , space charge effects due to schottky disorder are not considered in their model , although there exist clear space charge profiles in cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "it is thus desirable to make some theoretical inputs for this topic , which can help to provide useful guides to find practical ways to improve the transport properties of grain boundaries in ybco .    in this paper , first we construct a statistical thermodynamic model to study the origin and evolution of space charges due to the spectrum of point defect formation energies as a function of the variation of oxygen content in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath14 .",
    "then we develop one kinetically - limited model , including effects of doping and solute segregation , to study the process of ca doping upon low angle tilt grain boundaries in ybco and consequential influences on the space charge profile .",
    "the simplest imperfection in a crystal lattice is a lattice vacancy , which is a missing atom or ion .",
    "electrically neutral and structure - preserving groups of vacancies , known as schottky defects , are required in compounds .",
    "no matter by what means a schottky defect is made , it is necessary to expend a certain amount of work per atom taken to the surface .",
    "therefore , the energy of the crystal is increased . at a finite temperature ,",
    "the average energy of formation of the group of schottky defects determines the concentration of such point defects at equilibrium . for a multicomponent crystal ,",
    "the difference of the energy of formation of various defects determines the nature of space charge near interfaces @xcite .",
    "we calculated the point defect formation energies for both yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath3 and yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 by the mott - littleton approach @xcite which has been implemented in gulp codes @xcite .",
    "the pair potentials of the shell model used in this study were developed by baetzold for y-123 for studying ionic and electronic ( polaron ) defects @xcite .",
    "the calculated point defect formation energies are collected in table ( [ tab : pointdefect ] ) .",
    "the data for yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 agree nicely with the previous results @xcite using hades iii codes @xcite .",
    "it can be seen from table ( i ) that there is a wide spectrum in the calculated formation energies of individual vacancies in the schottky group for both yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath3 and yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "thus , in principle there should be space charges near free surfaces at equilibrium or quenched in from high temperatures where ionic mobility is high enough to maintain equilibrium .",
    "a similar phenomenon is expected to occur near internal interfaces such as grain boundaries , but the situation is more complex than for free surfaces for at least two reasons .",
    "first of all , the spectrum of dopant formation energies may be different for the process of removing an ion from a site in the bulk crystal and placing it at a site in the grain boundary .",
    "of course , at equilibrium the chemical potential of defects is the same throughout the crystal , but the local variations in concentration will be affected by different energies for excess species ( i.e. the ions removed to form the vacancies and placed at surface or boundary sites ) in different types of interfaces .",
    "the second complicating factor is that the local stoichiometry in the structural units ( or individual dislocation cores ) making up the boundary may be significantly different from that of the bulk in complex ionic crystals .",
    "advanced transmission electron microscopy has been used recently to show that this is the case for grain boundaries in srtio@xmath1 @xcite and for twin boundaries in batio@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is not entirely clear how such local chemistry at boundaries in complex oxides will affect the intrinsic space charges arising from the spectrum of defect formation energies in equilibrium groupings , e.g. schottky defects .",
    "therefore , we will restrict our detailed calculations of intrinsic space charge to free surfaces , but we expect the behavior at grain boundaries to be at least qualitatively similar .    .point defect formation energy ( ev ) in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath3 and yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "this defect formation energy refers to removing one ion from its lattice site and putting it at ledge - corner site on the surface of the crystal . [ cols=\">,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      doping ca in grain boundaries of ybco can improve the transport properties significantly since more holes are created near grain boundaries .",
    "the strong elastic strain field around grain boundaries has an important role in the segregation of dopants .",
    "the disruption of the lattice by a point defect , such as a dopant atom like ca@xmath15 substituting for y@xmath16 in ybco , gives rise to forces on the surrounding lattice atoms which , in turn , give rise to a displacement field in the lattice around the defect .",
    "the interaction between the defect displacement field and the stress fields of other defects , such as dislocations , or applied stress fields , alter the energy of the defect @xcite and cause defect segregation .",
    "the effects of the forces on the lattice due to the point defect can be described by means of force multipoles @xcite , which together with the green s tensor function of the matrix of the perfect crystal , can be used to calculate the resulting displacement field caused by the defect in the crystal . in this section ,",
    "we use numerical shell model calculations with gulp to estimate the strength of the elastic force dipole for the point defects ( dopants ) .",
    "then in the next section we apply anisotropic continuum elasticity to describe the stress field due to an edge dislocation ; finally we use continuum elasticity theory to compute the elastic interaction between the dopant atom and the dislocation .",
    "such methods have been shown to give good agreement with direct numerical calculations of the interaction between external pressure and vacancies in simple crystals such as van der waals bonded rare gas crystals ( see appendix 3 in reference @xcite ) .    to study the segregation of calcium around tilt grain boundaries , it is necessary to have the volume of solution to compute the contribution to the binding energy of ca@xmath15 at grain boundaries due to interactions with the strain field of edge dislocations in the boundaries .",
    "in the force - dipole approximation , the difference between the energy to form the defect in a crystal containing a strain field @xmath17 ( either from an applied stress or from the stress field of another defect ) and the energy in the strain - free crystal is given as    @xmath18    where the einstein summation convention for repeated indices is used and the coefficients a@xmath19 characterize the strength of the defect forces on the lattice .",
    "the effective body force , f , which the defect exerts on the lattice , is :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the dirac delta function .",
    "these three force components represent three orthogonal  double forces without moment \" and are sometimes called  force dipoles \" .",
    "the values of a@xmath19 , which have the unit of energy , must be obtained from experiment or numerical simulations . for a defect with",
    "spherical symmetry in an elastically isotropic matrix :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the kronecker @xmath24 ( = 1 , if i = j ; = 0 , if i@xmath25j ) , and    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the volume change produced by the formation of the defect in a finite crystal and b is the bulk modulus @xcite .",
    "thus from equation ( [ eq : eint ] ) we obtain    @xmath28    where p is the hydrostatic component of pressure at the defect , produced by external forces or other defects .    in the case of a defect with orthorhombic symmetry , equation ( [ eq : eint ] ) yields    @xmath29.\\ ] ]    clearly , it is necessary to evaluate e@xmath30 for three uniaxial strain cases . for strain along a - axis ( @xmath31 ) , we have    @xmath32    where e@xmath30 is evaluated from numerical simulation by gulp . using generalized hooke s law in the form of elastic compliances , s@xmath19",
    ", we obtain by choosing the crystal axes as principle ones    @xmath33    hence , the components of volume of formation of dopants are given as    @xmath34    the calculated components of the volume of solution for various divalent ions ( ae@xmath15 ) at the y@xmath16 site of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 are plotted in fig.[fig : cavol ] . considering the trend across the series of ae@xmath15",
    ", the ion size plays the important role in the stress effects caused by doping ae@xmath15 at y@xmath16 .",
    "the point defect for doping ae@xmath15 at y@xmath16 site carries one negative charge .",
    "this strongly repels the surrounding oxygen ions to make the sign of the volume of solution positive for ae ions whose radius is similar or larger than that of y@xmath16 ( 1.02 @xmath35 ) .",
    "note that the short range repulsion between ae and surrounding oxygen ions becomes larger with increasing ae ion radius , it is expected that the volume of solution increases with ae ion radius .",
    "however , for an ae ion with a larger radius , the polarization of the lattice around the solute which helps to lower defect s energy by polarizing electron  clouds \" also depends on the distortion of the lattice by the ae ion and thus contributes to the volume of formation .",
    "therefore , because of these competing effects the volume of formation ends up with a  satuation - like \" curve .",
    "components of volume of formation for doping ae@xmath15 at a y@xmath16 site of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 vs. radius of ae . ]      grain boundaries of importance in coated conductors are low - angle [ 001 ] tilt boundaries .",
    "thus they can be considered as an array of isolated edge dislocations .",
    "we observe that the elasticity in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 is not far different between the a- and b - axis ( ( c@xmath36-c@xmath37)/c@xmath37 @xmath38 0.082 ) , so this orthorhombic crystal can be approximated by a hexagonal one , which is motivated by the existence of closed - form expressions for the stress fields in the case of anisotropic elasticity in hexagonal crystals . here",
    "we average elastic constants of orthorhombic symmetry into those of permitted by hexagonal symmetry by taking arithmetical average of corresponding elastic moduli .",
    "the geometry of the dislocations in [ 001 ] tilt boundaries in y-123 is like prismatic slip in hexagonal crystals .",
    "the burger s vector lies in basal plane ( @xmath39 ) , while dislocation line runs along the hexad axis .",
    "the prismatic planes are @xmath40 . following ref .",

    "small angle ( usually less than 5@xmath44 ) grain boundaries can be considered as an array of isolated dislocations .",
    "the separation between dislocations is around @xmath45 .",
    "if we assume that a superposition approximation can be applied here , the total stress field can be written as    @xmath46    when doping calcium at yttrium sites , the non - zero tensional elements of the  volume of solution \" will interact with the stress field . neglecting the effect of the solute atom on the local elastic modulii",
    ", the segregation energy of calcium can be written as    @xmath47    in the previous section , we calculated the energy for doping calcium at yttrium sites inside a stress free bulk y-123 .",
    "here we computed the segregation energy for calcium due to the stress field around very small angle ( usually less than 5@xmath44 ) tilt boundaries , which is plotted in fig.[fig : caseg ] .",
    "since our region of interest is at a small distance from the dislocation cores , there exist possible errors in using linear elasticity theory here and our results are probably overestimated .",
    "however , the relative energy differences are more important than absolute values . in fig.[fig : caseg ] , the calculations show that calcium segregation is expected to the tensile stress region due to the positive sign of volume of formation .",
    "this will affect the distribution of mobile hole around grain boundaries .",
    "we will study this further in the following section for general grain boundaries .",
    "elastic components of the segregation energy of calcium around the center of an edge dislocations in small angle tilt grain boundaries yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "@xmath48 is the angle starting from ( 0,b ) , rotating counterclockwise around the core of small angle ( usually less than 5@xmath44 ) tilt grain boundaries for a distance of one burgers vectors from the center . ]",
    "it has been noted @xcite that edge dislocations could act as sources and sinks for vacancies such that space charges would appear also in the regions near dislocation cores .",
    "the modeling of space charges around dislocation cores is more difficult than our treatment of the intrinsic space charges at free surfaces from the difference in formation energy of equilibrium point defects . if for no other reason than that different in the energy required for creation of point defects by removing ions from the bulk and placing them in the dislocation core , it is not likely to be quite the same as that for free surfaces .",
    "however there is also likely to be an alteration of the space charge by dopants and their accompanying holes if the dopants tend to segregate to the dislocations . in the previous section ( ii b.3 )",
    "it was shown that there is a strong attraction of the ae@xmath15 dopants , i.e. ca , sr , and ba , to the tensile regions of isolated edge dislocations in low angle grain boundaries and a repulsion from the compressive regions .",
    "we will illustrate some of the effects of such dopant segregation on space charges by an idealized planar grain boundary which consists of joining together two free surfaces with their associated point defect space charges , together with ca@xmath15 dopants and accompanying holes which have segregated in the stress fields of the boundary .",
    "we assume that the dopant atoms are attracted to or repelled from region along the boundary by the elastic fields which decay going away from the boundary .",
    "the results of this calculation will illustrate the interplay between dopant segregation and point defect induced by space charges .    from previous thermodynamic calculations we know that hole density changes with the content of doped calcium .",
    "consequently , the debye length varies with ca concentration .",
    "note that the defect created by replacing y@xmath16 with ca@xmath15 carries one negative charge . assuming the total number of ca@xmath15 is conserved , after solving the distribution of charged particles in an electrostatic field caused by space charges , the defect density @xmath49 at the position of x with the electrostatic @xmath48(x ) away from the boundary plane is given as    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the density of calciums at surfaces determined by the following condition    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the total concentration of doped calciums .",
    "since each ca@xmath15 is accompanied by one mobile hole , the density of holes near surfaces ( @xmath54 ) is determined by the following condition ( assuming the total number of holes are conserved )    @xmath55    note that we extend our studies to general grain boundaries here based on understanding divalent dopants interaction with stress field of small angle tilt boundaries . as there can be a significant strain field in the grain boundaries region , originating from size mismatch between solute and matrix atoms , dislocation , etc",
    ", a strain energy term should be included in the studies of ca - doping because the strain field due to dislocations at grain boundaries can substantially affect the segregation of ca .",
    "we ignore the elastic interactions with the boundaries of the charged vacancies , and approximate the effect of the stress field of the boundary by an elastic term of the calcium by the same form used in ref .",
    "@xcite :    @xmath56    where u@xmath57 is the binding energy near the dislocation core .",
    "we choose n=2 , and d is about two lattice parameters along b - axis .",
    "this is consistent with the periodicity of the structural units proposed in the coincidence models of grain boundary structures @xcite .",
    "calculations in the previous section indicated that the volume of solution for doping calcium at yttrium sites is positive .",
    "hence , the positive sign of @xmath58 means in the compression region which repels ca , while the negative sign of @xmath58 means in the tensile region which attracts ca .",
    "the charge density now is given by    @xmath59    following the same process as previous section , the poisson equation can be re - written as    @xmath60.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when calcium is doped in ybco , the process is often designed so that calcium diffuses into grain boundaries first .",
    "however , it is difficult to estimate the amount of calcium at the grain boundaries during the deposition process . in this section , we assume the hole density and the amount of calcium near grain boundaries are 0.6 and 0.08 per unit volume , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the elastic binding energy of calcium is chosen to include both compression and tension regions : @xmath61 .",
    "this is shown in fig.5 for an idealized boundary in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 . as discussed in previous section ,",
    "the grain boundaries in o@xmath2 may be negatively charged because of the intrinsic space charges due to point defects .",
    "it should be also stressed that calcium is doped at yttrium sites , such that this site has one negative charge accompanied by making holes at cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "therefore , the screening length becomes even shorter than that of pure @xmath62 .",
    "if the calcium is pushed away from grain boundaries , the space charge remains almost the same ( somehow little dependent on repulsive energy ) .",
    "however , on the other hand , if the calcium is attracted by grain boundaries , extra negative charge will accumulate around grain boundaries such that the space charge s profile is significantly adjusted .",
    "this can strongly perturb the distribution of mobile hole density around grain boundaries .",
    "the stress field around grain boundaries is also so strong ( around @xmath63 gpa based on our calculated elastic properties of ybco that it significantly affects the surrounding oxygen content and ordering @xcite ) .",
    "if oxygen content is close to o@xmath3 , the grain boundaries are possibly positively charged , and the large debye length leads to a larger portion of the bulk being exposed into the influence of grain boundaries . under such circumstances , doping with calcium not only neutralizes ( by the intrinsic negative charge of ca@xmath64 ) the charged boundaries , but also increases the density of mobile holes to screen the charged boundaries .",
    "therefore , the bad low angle tilt boundaries are  cured \" by doping calcium .",
    "space charge of doping calcium at idealized @xmath65 grain boundaries at 723@xmath44c .",
    "s is the reduced length , scaled by the debye length .",
    "u is energy due to strain field .",
    "negative sign means attractive interaction . ]",
    "we have systematically studied the space charge profile for yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath3 , yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , and ca - doped cases .",
    "intrinsic space charge is strongly dependent on the oxygen content of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath14 , which is determined by the annealing temperature and oxygen partial pressure .",
    "for yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath3 the chain copper is loosely bound with neighboring two oxygens , therefore it is comparatively easier to create vacancies at copper chain sites for o@xmath3 .",
    "hence , the grain boundaries are possibly positively charged . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculations show that it requires less energy to make vacancies at oxygen sites for o@xmath2 .",
    "consequently , it was seen that there exists a dramatic change in the nature of the space charge in going from o@xmath3 to o@xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the origin of the screening in going from o@xmath3 to o@xmath2 is completely different . for o@xmath3",
    "it is the thermal activated vacancies , while for o@xmath2 it is the mobile holes .",
    "this is very similar to the two screening mechanisms in semiconductors : one is intrinsic , the other is free carriers due to doped impurities .",
    "in addition , we have carried out studies of the segregation of calcium at tilt grain boundaries in the y-123 compound . by comparing calculated heat of solution for various doping mechanisms ,",
    "we have found that the most energetically favorable defect reaction is that of doping calcium at yttrium sites accompanied by creating one hole in the cuo@xmath0 plane per ca ion .",
    "this conclusion is valid for the reaction in the bulk , which agrees with previous experimental measurements @xcite . to study the segregation of calcium at tilt boundaries , the volume of formation is needed in order to estimate the binding energy to the elastic strain field which arises from the grain boundary dislocations .",
    "we computed this for the doping series of alkaline earths at yittrium sites . after including the strain field contribution ,",
    "the segregation energy of calcium at small angle tilt boundaries is obtained .",
    "the theoretical results suggest that more calcium is expected in the tensile regions around tilt grain boundaries . for calcium - doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath14 case ,",
    "our calculations indicate that y@xmath16 ions are replaced by ca@xmath15 ions , accompanied by creating holes in cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "the increase of hole content strongly enhances the screening effect by mobile holes . the strong screening effect ( much shorter screening length ) helps to decrease the area of influence of the grain boundaries . besides",
    ", the segregation of calcium is strongly determined by the strain field .",
    "more calcium segregation is expected in tensile stress regions .",
    "since the calcium is doped at yttrium sites , it has one negative charge .",
    "therefore , the segregation of calcium causes extra negative defects to approach grain boundaries such that the potential decreases quite significantly . consequently , the hole content near grain boundaries increases , thus helping to screening out the effect of disorder at the boundary . in summary ,",
    "the nature of space charge is closely related to the oxygen content . doping",
    "calcium at small angle tilt grain boundaries of ybco leads to the increase of j@xmath66 through increasing the hole content , enhancing negative potential regions due to the segregation of calcium , and helping to passivate disorder at the boundary .",
