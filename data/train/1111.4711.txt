    "* the sequence . * in blazars , radio loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with their relativistic jet axis pointing to our line of sight , the synchrotron peak frequency ( @xmath3 ) covers a wide range ( @xmath4 hz ) , with bllacs ( bll , lineless blazars ) spanning the entire range and fsrqs ( flat spectrum radio quasars , sources with strong broad emission lines ) having lower @xmath3 ( @xmath5 hz ) .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt the generic terms for low , intermediate , and high _ synchrotron - peaking _ ( lsp , isp , hsp ) blazars independently of the spectroscopic type .",
    "@xcite found that as the source synchrotron power @xmath6 increases , @xmath3 decreases , with predominantly fsrq sources at the low @xmath3 , high @xmath6 end through lsp , isp , and finally hsp bllacs at the low @xmath6 end .",
    "they also used the sparse _ egret _ data to argue that the same reduction of the peak frequency happens in the high energy - presumably inverse compton ( ic ) component - component and that the compton dominance ( the ratio of ic to synchrotron power ) increases with source power .",
    "@xcite suggested that more efficient cooling of particles in the jets of high luminosity blazars is responsible for the lower peak frequencies .    * from sequence to envelope . *",
    "@xcite and @xcite identified relatively powerful sources with a radio to x - ray spectral index @xmath7 typical of weak sources with @xmath3 in the x - rays .",
    "such sources , if confirmed , challenge the sequence . upon close study , however , their x - ray emission was found not to be of synchrotron origin @xcite and as of now sources with high @xmath6 - high @xmath3 have not been found @xcite .",
    "sources below the blazar sequence are expected from jets less aligned to the line of sight .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that new sources they identified modify the blazar sequence to an _ envelope_. * challenges .",
    "* @xcite found several low @xmath6 - low @xmath3 sources that , because they have a high core dominance ( @xmath8 , ratio of core and therefore beamed to extended and therefore isotropic radio emission ) , are not intrinsically bright sources at a larger jet angle .",
    "these sources challenge the sequence because ( @xmath0 ) both intrinsically weak and intrinsically powerful jets can have similar @xmath3 and ( @xmath1 ) intrinsically weak jets can produce a wide range of @xmath3 from ( @xmath9 - @xmath10 hz ) .",
    "another challenge came from @xcite who showed that , contrary to what is anticipated by the sequence , high and low synchrotron peak frequency ( hsp and lsp ) bl lacertae objects ( blls , blazars with emission line ew @xmath11  ) have similar @xmath12 .",
    "these findings challenge the sequence , even after being extended to include the sources in the envelope as de - beamed analogs of the blazar sequence sources .",
    "@xcite argued that at a critical value of the accretion rate @xmath13 , the accretion switches from a standard radiatively efficient thin disk with accretion - related emission power @xmath14 for @xmath15 , to a radiatively inefficient mode where @xmath16 .",
    "this critical point may be connected to the transition between fanaroff riley ( fr ; * ? ? ? * ) ii to fr i radio galaxies ( rg ) : the level of the low frequency extended radio emission ( coming mostly from the radio lobes and considered to be isotropic ) that separates fr i and fr ii rg , has been shown to be a function of the host galaxy optical magnitude @xcite : the division between fr i and fr ii is at higher radio luminosities for brighter galaxies .",
    "@xcite argued that , because the optical magnitude of a galaxy is related to the central black home mass @xcite and the extended radio luminosity is related to the jet kinetic luminosity ( following the scaling of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this division can be casted as a division in terms of the fraction of the eddington luminosity carried by the jet : jets with kinetic luminosity @xmath17 give rise to fr i rg , while jets with @xmath18 are predominantly fr ii sources .",
    "interestingly , and in agreement with the unification scheme , @xcite and @xcite find that the same dichotomy applies to separating blls and fsrq , the aligned versions of fr i and fr ii respectively . finally , it is very intriguing that @xcite argue that there is a paucity of sources around @xmath19 .",
    "fr i , low line excitation fr ii and some high line excitation fr ii were found to occupy the low @xmath20 regime , while the high @xmath20 regime was occupied by high line excitation fr ii , broad line radio galaxies and powerful radio quasars .",
    "track ( a ) shows the path of a synchrotron peak for a single speed jet in an environment of radiatively efficient accretion and ( b ) for a decelerating jet of the type hypothesized to exist in fri sources as the jet orientation changes.__,width=268 ]",
    "recently , we ( * ? ? ?",
    "* heretofore m11 ) compiled the largest sample of radio loud agn for which sufficient data existed to determine variability - averaged @xmath3 @xmath6 , as well as the extended low frequency radio emission @xmath12 .",
    "this is an important quantity in our study , because it has been shown to be a good proxy for the jet kinetic power @xmath21 , as measured by the energy required to inflate the x - ray cavities seen to coincide with the radio lobes of a number of sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the picture that emerges ( figure [ m11 ] ) exhibits some important differences with the blazar sequence .",
    "in particular , isp blls have @xmath21 comparable to that of hsp and lsp blls .",
    "also , although all the fr i galaxies were found to have similar @xmath21 with blls , no fr i galaxies were found with @xmath22 hz .",
    "because there is no obvious selection acting against the detection of fr i galaxies with core sed peaking at higher energies , we are lead to conclude that the un - aligned versions of hsp blazars have @xmath3 smaller by a factor of least @xmath23 compared to their aligned equivalent , something that agrees with the existence of velocity profiles in the emitting plasma , as supported by other investigations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in m11 we suggested that _ extragalactic jets can be described in terms of two families_. the first is that of weak jets characterized by velocity profiles and weak or absent broad emission lines .",
    "hsps ( @xmath24 hz ) , isps ( @xmath25 hz ) , and fr i rg belong to this family . on the basis of having similar @xmath21 with hsps and fr",
    "i rg , the isp sources were argued to be somewhat un - aligned hsps .",
    "the second family is that of more powerful jets having a single lorentz factor emitting plasma and , in most cases , stronger broad emission lines .",
    "interestingly , the two families divide at @xmath26 erg s@xmath27 , which for @xmath28 , corresponds to @xmath29 , similar to the @xmath30 of @xcite . aligned sources are found along the broken power sequence depicted by the solid lines a and b with a ( b ) corresponding to jets in radiatively efficient ( inefficient ) accretion environments with @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) . the broken lines a and b depict the tracks followed by two sources as they depart from the power sequence and their orientation angle @xmath33 increases . while in the first case a single velocity flow is assumed , in the second case emission from a decelerating flow",
    "is considered @xcite .    .",
    "see text for the description of boxes a , b , c and zones @xmath34.__,width=268 ]",
    "we now discuss some predictions of the new unification scheme and their confirmation from the current data .    * @xmath35 increases along the two branches of the broken power sequence .",
    "* we examine now if along the two branches of the power sequence , depicted schematically by the red and blue arrows in the figure [ prelim ] , @xmath21 increases . to do that , we select those sources that are close to the sequence of powerful aligned objects and split them in three groups a , b , c , as seen in figure [ prelim ] . in figure [ powerful ]",
    "we plot the @xmath21 distribution of sources in these three groups .",
    "as expected , the average @xmath21 increases from group c to a. running the same test for jets with inefficient accretion requires to use sources that are not aligned , because of the small number of sources .",
    "for this reason , we select all low power sources with @xmath36 to insure that we do not have any mixing with sources of the other branch and we separate them in the three groups @xmath37 ( figure [ prelim ] ) separated by the de - beaming tracks of a decelerating jet depicted also in figure [ m11 ] .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ weak ] , the average @xmath21 increases from group @xmath38 to @xmath39 , according to our expectations .        * as @xmath35 increases , the fraction of the blls decreases along the powerful sequence . * as @xmath21 increases along the powerful sequence , @xmath6 increases , but @xmath3 decreases . at the same time , if we assume that @xmath21 scales with accretion power , we expect that the blr luminosity increases",
    ". if @xmath3 did not change , we would expect that the ratio of the blr to optical synchrotron emission would not change .",
    "but @xmath3 does decrease as @xmath21 increases , shifting the synchrotron component to lower frequencies and revealing more of the blr .",
    "thus we expect that the fraction of sources that is classified as blls will become smaller as @xmath21 increases along the powerful sequence .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure [ powerful ] , with the fraction of blls clearly decreases as @xmath21 decreases .",
    "* for powerful sources , the fraction of blls increases for less aligned sources . * in our scheme",
    ", we expect that for powerful sources of a given @xmath21 , as they become more un - aligned , the beamed synchrotron emission will decrease , while the blr luminosity will be much less affected , resulting to a decreasing fraction of blls for more un - aligned sources . to address this , we selected sources with @xmath40 erg s@xmath27 ( orange sources in figure [ prelim ] ) and we plotted the fraction of blls as a function of radio core dominance @xmath41 which is an orientation indicator .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ bll_fraction ] , as the core dominance decreases , the fraction of blls quickly decreases , in agreement with our expectations .",
    "* a given accretion power @xmath42 corresponds to a narrow @xmath35 range .",
    "* we collected black hole masses from the literature for most of the sources of m11 and used them to calculate the ratio of @xmath43 .",
    "we plot our results in figure [ mcrit ] : in blue sources with @xmath44 hz , almost exclusively blls , therefore radiatively inefficient accretors ; in red sources with @xmath45 hz and @xmath46 erg s@xmath27 , almost all fsrqs , therefore radiatively efficient accretors .",
    "the separation of red and blue sources at @xmath47 suggests that there is a transition at @xmath48 with radiatively efficient accretion at @xmath49 and that sources with a given accretion power do not produce jets with @xmath21 significantly smaller or larger than their accretion power ."
