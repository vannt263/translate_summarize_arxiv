    "although a spatially extended field may be smooth , and contain no infinities , it may nonetheless have point singularities associated with its topology .",

    "critical points _",
    "( stationary points ) , where the gradient of the field vanishes and the gradient direction can not be defined ; in the neighbourhood of such a point , the gradient direction changes arbitrarily quickly through all of its values .",
    "such points are characterised by a _",
    "topological charge _ , a signed integer which is determined by the local geometry of the singularity ; in the case of critical points , the number is the ( signed ) number of rotations of the gradient vector around the critical point ; it is @xmath1 for maxima and minima , and @xmath2 for saddles .",
    "the topological charge is also called the _ poincar index _ ( or _ hopf index _ ) ( milnor 1965 ) , and is defined as a signed integer at the point zeros of @xmath0-dimensional real vector fields in @xmath0 dimensions . although the number of zeros may change as a field evolves , the total topological charge is constant ; it is a topological invariant .    here",
    ", i discuss the statistical properties of various zeros / singularities , in fields which are specified by gaussian random functions . in this case , only structurally stable zeros of charge @xmath3 occur .",
    "specifically , i shall discuss how densities and two point charge correlation functions of the distributions of signed singularities may be calculated under a rather general scheme , and then use this scheme to calculate the topological charge correlation functions of three types of singularity in isotropic random fields : zeros of @xmath0-dimensional vectors in @xmath0-dimensional space ( rederiving a result originally due to halperin ( 1981 ) ) ; critical points of random scalar fields in two dimensions ; and umbilic points of random scalar fields in two dimensions .",
    "the charge correlation functions for each of these types of topological singularity are found to be different in each case , and dependent on the underlying correlation function of the gaussian field .",
    "each function is found to satisfy a screening relation associated with ionic liquids .",
    "topological zeros are very important in many areas of physics and mathematics : in addition to critical points ( gradient zeros ) which have obvious importance , the zeros of 2-dimensional complex scalar fields ( phase singularities , wave dislocations , vortices , realised as 2-dimensional vectors ) are also of great interest , especially where the field is a quantum wavefunction or an optical field ( e.g. nye and berry 1974 , berry and dennis 2000 , dennis 2001b ) , or an order parameter ( mermin 1979 ) .",
    "only point zeros are considered here - the dimensionality @xmath0 of the vector field , whose zeros provide the singularity , is assumed equal to the dimensionality of the space .    the first systematic study of the statistical geometry of random real scalar fields in two dimensions was by longuet - higgins ( 1957a , b , 1958 ) , who generalised one - dimensional methods of rice ( 1954 ) to calculate , amongst other things , the densities of critical points and probability density function of the gaussian curvature of the function .",
    "halperin ( 1981 ) derived the @xmath0-dimensional vector correlation function , whose proof was supplied by liu and mazenko ( 1992 ) , and has recently been recast in the language of riemannian geometry by foltin ( 2003a ) .",
    "various correlation functions in two dimensions , including those for phase singularities and critical points , were investigated numerically by freund and wilkinson ( 1998 ) .",
    "planar phase singularity correlations ( including density correlations ) were investigated by berry and dennis ( 2000 ) .",
    "the topological singularities of interest are the zeros of an @xmath0-dimensional vector field @xmath4 the field is a smooth function defined on an @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space , with points labelled by the vector @xmath5 in random fields , the only statistically significant zeros are those of first order , whose jacobian determinant @xmath6 is nonzero ( where @xmath7 ) . the topological charge of such zeros is given by @xmath8    when the field is random , the density @xmath9 of zeros at a position @xmath10 is @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes averaging over the statistical ensemble , and the zeros are identified by the @xmath0-dimensional dirac @xmath13-function .",
    "the modulus of the jacobian is included to ensure that each zero has the correct statistical weight , so @xmath9 has the units of density .",
    "this expression confirms that degenerate zeros are so rare they have no statistical significance .",
    "the average topological charge @xmath14 at @xmath10 is expressed as the density ( [ eq : densdef ] ) , but each singularity is weighted by its charge , that is , the sign of the jacobian .",
    "the charge correlation functions @xmath15 with which this paper is concerned are the generalisation of the average charge density to that at two points @xmath16 normalised by the density : @xmath17    in the following section , the scheme for calculating topological charge correlation functions ( [ eq : gdef ] ) in general gaussian random fields is explained .",
    "section [ sec : fields ] then provides background to gaussian fields which are statistically stationary and isotropic . the scheme is then applied to zeros of @xmath0-dimensional vector fields ( section [ sec : vec ] ) , critical points of 2-dimensional scalar fields ( section [ sec : crit ] ) , and umbilic points of the same fields ( section [ sec : umbilic ] ) .",
    "the phenomenon of topological charge screening in these three cases is discussed in section [ sec : screening ] .",

    "it implies that the distribution of topological charges is such that every topological charge tends to be surrounded by charges of the opposite sign , such that the topological charge is ` screened ' at large distances .",
    "this fact was noticed in the random vector case by halperin ( 1981 ) and liu and mazenko ( 1992 ) ( although the general zero density @xmath135 had not been determined explicitly ) and is independent of the field correlation function @xmath258 the derivation here shows that this is a more general phenomenon , possibly a universal feature of topological charge correlations for gaussian random fields .",
    "it should be noted that ( [ eq : screening1 ] ) is not necessarily satisfied for an arbitrary distribution of signed points ; for instance , @xmath259 always for poisson points , for which there is no screening . @xmath13-function correlations at the origin are ignored in the following .",
    "an analogy may be drawn from the theory of ionic liquids ( hansen and mcdonald 1986 ) ; in a fluid or plasma , consisting of two species identical except for opposite ( coulomb ) charges , the following stillinger - lovett sum rules ( stillinger and lovett 1968a , b ) are found to hold : @xmath260 here , @xmath15 is the charge - charge correlation function , @xmath261 is a characteristic screening length dependent on temperature and @xmath26 and @xmath262 is a constant dependent on dimensionality .",
    "these rules are discussed for @xmath263 by hansen and mcdonald ( 1986 ) , stillinger and lovett 1968a , b , and @xmath36 by jancovici 1987 , jancovici 1994 .",
    "the screening relation ( [ eq : screening1 ] ) is equivalent to the first stillinger - lovett sum rule ( [ eq : slsumrule1 ] ) , which is derived using the statistical mechanics of pairwise , coulomb interacting fluids .",
    "it is unclear whether the fact that topological and coulombic charges screen in the same way is coincidence , or evidence of some deeper connection between the two statistical theories .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the topological charge correlation functions satisfy the second sum rule , which ( upon integrating the left hand side of ( [ eq : slsumrule2 ] ) by parts ) , depends on the integral of @xmath264 for @xmath265 it was found ( berry and dennis 2000 ) that for certain choices of @xmath120 this integral may diverge .",
    "the slowest decay comes when @xmath266 and by ( [ eq : hndef ] ) , @xmath267 giving a logarithmic divergence for the second moment . for comparison ,",
    "the critical and umbilic functions @xmath268 ( equations ( [ eq : hcrit ] ) , ( [ eq : humb ] ) respectively ) both give , for the same choice of @xmath120 @xmath269 implying that the second sum rule is satisfied generally for critical and umbilic points , although , as for the cases of random vectors where the integral converges , the screening length @xmath270 defined in analogy to ( [ eq : slsumrule2 ] ) , depends on the choice of @xmath258 for random vectors with @xmath126 the second moment of @xmath15 always converges , because of the higher power of @xmath271 appearing in ( [ eq : hndef ] ) ( also , the decay of @xmath108 will be faster , as discussed at the end of section [ sec : fields ] ) .",
    "comparison may be drawn to the electrostatic analogy in random matrix theory , particularly in the case of the so - called ginibre ensemble of @xmath272 matrices whose entries are independent , identically distributed circular gaussian random variables ( ginibre 1965 ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of these matrices are found to have exactly the same statistical behaviour as a 1-component 2-dimensional coulomb gas of @xmath20 charges in a harmonic oscillator potential , and the 2-point density correlation function screens against a uniform background ( i.e. @xmath273 ) , and have finite second moment .",
    "certain random polynomial analogues have zeros that can also be expressed as 2-dimensional coulomb gases with additional interactions ( hannay 1998 , forrester and honner 1999 ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of random matrices ( which may be expressed as the zeros of the characteristic polynomial ) and zeros of random polynomials are all of the same sign , since they are zeros of complex analytic functions , and the density correlation functions of zeros are unique ( there is no analogue of @xmath108 )",
    ".    there may be a danger in taking the analogy with fluids too far ; for instance , the oscillations of the functions in figures [ fig : g2],[fig : gc],[fig : gu]a are reminiscent of those of charged fluids ( e.g. hansen and mcdonald 1986 ) . however , the physical causes for these oscillations are very different . in fluids ,",
    "the oscillations usually arise from packing considerations ( the ions themselves are of finite size , fixing the lengthscale , although in plasmas they are usually represented as point charges ( baus and hansen 1980 ) ) .",
    "topological charges , on the other hand , are points , and the oscillations in these figures originate from the oscillations in the underlying field correlation function @xmath104 which is @xmath274 in this case .",
    "although halperin ( 1981 ) discusses the similarity between the short - range behaviour of the 2-dimensional vector correlation function ( [ eq : vecgab ] ) , ( [ eq : hndef ] ) and kosterlitz - thouless theory , the present situation is more general , both in that the ( possibly long - range ) screening is exact , and that the results hold for any reasonable field correlation function @xmath275",
    "using a general scheme for calculating topological charge correlation functions , three particular correlation functions were found explicitly , and were found always to satisfy a screening relation ( [ eq : screening1 ] ) .",
    "the scheme of section [ sec : scheme ] used to calculate the charge correlation functions is very general , and can be generalised to calculate the charge - charge correlation function between two different sets of topological charges - for instance with a critical point at @xmath276 and an umbilic point at @xmath29 although not done so here , the scheme may be applied to anisotropic fields .",
    "it is rather more difficult to calculate the density correlation function for topological charges ( the analogue of ( [ eq : gdef ] ) where the moduli of the jacobians are taken ) .",
    "it was calculated for 1-dimensional vectors ( i.e. random functions in 1 dimension ) by rice ( 1954 ) , and for 2-dimensional vectors ( realised as complex scalars ) by berry and dennis ( 2000 ) , saichev ( 2001 ) .",
    "however , it has not been possible to generalise such methods to the case of critical points . also , numerical evidence ( freund and wilkinson 1998 ) suggests that the correlation function of extrema signed by the sign of their laplacian ( @xmath1 for minima , @xmath2 for maxima ) also satisfies the screening relation ( [ eq : slsumrule1 ] ) .",
    "all such functions would be needed to calculate the partial correlation functions between the species ( e.g. maxima with maxima , maxima with saddles , maxima with minima , etc ) , which would give a complete statistical picture .",
    "the presence of boundaries in the random function will affect the statistical properties of topological charges ( e.g. berry ( 2002 ) for nodal points in the plane ) , and it is possible that there may be some further analogy with the physics of interfaces of coulomb fluids .",
    "the scheme of section [ sec : scheme ] ought to be adaptable to calculate charge correlation functions in this case",
    ".    only zeros of fields linear in gaussian random functions have been considered here , although the density of others may be calculated , for instance , in addition to nodal points , a 2-dimensional gaussian random complex scalar has critical points of its modulus squared ( weinrib and halperin 1982 ) and its argument ( dennis 2001a ) .",
    "the scheme employed here can not be used to calculate correlation functions for these , although numerical evidence ( i freund , personal communication ) suggests that the critical points of argument ( together with the nodal points ) do screen , therefore adding to the cases shown here .",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that topological charge screening may be a universal phenomenon in gaussian random fields .",
