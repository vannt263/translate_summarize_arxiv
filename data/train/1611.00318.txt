    ", width=321 ]    in the above materials , both the l and h phases are thought to possess correlated 4@xmath18 electrons , but with very different effective kondo temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the effective kondo temperatures of the h phases are small , so that the properties of the 4@xmath18 electrons will be almost indistinguishable from those of localized ionic moments  @xcite ; any remaining itinerant quasiparticles will have relatively light effective masses ( as we observe experimentally in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 ; see the discussion of fig .",
    "[ cefreqs1](c ) ) .",
    "by contrast , the l phases of the above - mentioned systems have relatively large kondo temperatures .",
    "this will cause the 4@xmath18 electrons to be in the mixed - valence regime with signifcant @xmath39 and @xmath18 hybridization , resulting in itinerant quasiparticles with a large effective mass  @xcite .",
    "this is again in accord with the behavior of ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 ; the l phase has an estimated kondo temperature @xmath40  k  [ ] , and evidence for a very heavy effective mass is given by heat - capacity data  @xcite that reveal a relatively large electronic heat - capacity coefficient @xmath41 , despite the small itinerant carrier density  @xcite .    in all such systems ,",
    "the l - phase itinerant quasiparticles will be preferable to quasi - localized electrons from an energetic standpoint - they have smaller zero - point energy  at low temperatures , but quasi - localized 4@xmath18 electrons will be favoured on entropic grounds at elevated temperatures  @xcite . therefore , increasing the temperature will drive the l to h transition .",
    "similarly , a magnetic field affects the free energy of the quasi - localized 4@xmath18 electrons in the h phase more strongly than the energies of the band quasiparticles in either the l or h phases  @xcite .",
    "thus , the h phase becomes more energetically favorable with increasing field , so that a field - driven l to h transition occurs , as observed in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 and the other systems  @xcite .",
    "in common with our observations of ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 , the valence transitions from l to h phases in ybincu@xmath0 , ce and ce alloys are marked by ( very frequently broadened ) changes in resistivity and magnetic susceptibility , both accompanied by hysteresis in field and temperature sweeps  @xcite .",
    "this type of transition is most spectacular in elemental cerium and ce alloys  @xcite , where the l phase is known as the @xmath42 phase , and h as the @xmath43 phase  @xcite .",
    "whereas the 4@xmath18 ions in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 and ybincu@xmath0 represent a relatively small proportion of the elements in their respective solids , in ce itself , _ every _ ion is involved , and the @xmath44 transition is accompanied by a 14.8% volume collapse as the redistribution of charge between ions and the sea of itinerant quasiparticles occurs ; nevertheless , the face - centred - cubic ( fcc ) structure of ce is preserved  @xcite .",
    "this fascinating aspect of cerium s behavior means that the @xmath44 transition has attracted considerable attention , especially in the metallurgy community ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "in the l phase of ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 , all of the available electrons will contribute to the sea of itinerant quasiparticles ; ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 will be a compensated semimetal  @xcite with a fermi surface similar to that shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ cearea](b ) .",
    "though the carrier density is small , bandstructure calculations  @xcite suggest that the chemical potential is located in a region where there exists a very large density of states associated with bands derived mostly from the 4@xmath18 orbitals , leading to a large electronic heat capacity  @xcite . on moving from the l to the h phase , the removal of @xmath18 electrons from the itinerant quasiparticle sea will have the effect of lowering the chemical potential , leading to a hole fermi surface at the @xmath23 point , similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ cearea](c )  [ ] . in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 ,",
    "the transition from a small density of very heavy quasiparticles ( l phase ) to a larger fermi surface of much lighter holes ( h phase ) should lower the resistivity , as is indeed observed experimentally ( fig .",
    "[ cesweep](a ) ) ; this is in contrast to the case of ce , where the very different bandstructure leads to a rise in resistance on going from @xmath42 ( l ) to @xmath43 ( h )  [ ] .",
    "finally , as the chemical potential in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 moves down at the l to h transition , away from the bands with the high density of states  @xcite , the electronic contribution to the heat capacity should also fall , despite the larger fermi surface  @xcite ; experiments carried out at fields close to the l to h border seem to suggest that the electronic heat - capacity coefficient @xmath43 indeed falls with increasing field  @xcite .",

    ", the l phase seems to be characterized by a relatively high @xmath49 , and the h phase by lower , less field - dependent values . at temperatures above 1.5  k , our notional boundary between l and h phases is therefore based on the idea that some characteristic value of the differential susceptibility ( _ i.e. _ a contour in fig .  [ cephase](c ) ) separates the two states  @xcite . to this end , note that the resistive minimum and the kinks in the pdo data above 1.5  k lie at very similar values of @xmath49 .",
    "we therefore trace a notional l to h phase boundary that connects these points , roughly following the @xmath49 contours ( fig .",
    "[ cephase](c ) ; purple curve ) .",
    "sections iiia and iiic describe how , below 1.5  k and above 10  t , we expect the l to h transition and the boundary of the antiferromagnetic phase to coincide ; below 1.5  k , the notional phase boundary follows the pdo data to reflect the change in character of the l to h transition observed in this region ( see fig .",
    "[ cesweep ] ) .    at first sight , by analogy with other correlated - electron systems  @xcite , it is tempting to simply ascribe the antiferromagnetic phase to a region of quantum fluctuations around the point at which the l to h transition plunges to @xmath60 .",
    "however , the manner in which the susceptibility contours , and hence the notional l to h phase boundary , curve back towards the origin as the temperature is cooled below 10  k is suggestive of some more complex interplay .",
    "related behavior has been seen in the phase diagrams of reduced - dimensionality antiferromagnets  @xcite ; but by contrast , in those cases , the effect occurred on the high@xmath61 , low@xmath62 side of the phase boundary and was attributed to the effect of thermal fluctuations on the free energy of the system  @xcite . in the case of ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 , the backwards curvature instead occurs in the vicinity of the low - temperature antiferromagnetic state [ orange phase boundary in fig .",
    "[ cephase](c ) ] .",
    "it is therefore possible that the effect is due here to antiferromagnetic fluctuations , rather than thermal fluctuations , that act to destabilise the l phase , pulling the l to h boundary to lower fields as temperature is reduced towards the antiferromagnetic transition .",

    "are shown as continuous curves ; for convenience , we use the same cross - section labels as that work .",

    ", it appears that the fermi surface cross - sectional area changes relatively slowly as one moves away from the extremal orbit along a direction @xmath70 .",
    "such a topology will give an enhanced quantum - oscillation amplitude for a narrow range of angles around this field orientation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , as discussed below , the effective masses are generally lower in ndos@xmath0sb@xmath1 than in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 , favoring the observation of quantum oscillations in the former .",
    "band structure calculations for pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 predict a splitting of the @xmath42 frequency for fields around the [ 001 ] direction ; this was not observed in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1  [ ] but seems to be resolved in the present experiments on ndos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "effective masses @xmath24 were derived from the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitudes as shown in figure  [ ndqos](c ) ; values are tabulated in table  [ effmass ] , and analogous data for pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 are shown for comparison .",
    "the masses for ndos@xmath0sb@xmath1 are consistently smaller than their equivalents in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 , suggesting that the interactions that lead to mass renormalization are smaller in the former compound .    as mentioned in the introduction , ndos@xmath0sb@xmath1 is a ferromagnet with an ordering temperature @xmath71  k displaying mean - field ferromagnetism  @xcite .",
    "its temperature - linear heat - capacity coefficient is @xmath72 ; that for pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 is @xmath73  [ ] .",
    "the fact that the effective masses are significantly larger in the latter than the former ( table  [ effmass ] ) , whilst the @xmath43 values are relatively close , suggests that another contribution to @xmath43 might be present in ndos@xmath74sb@xmath1 .",
    "theoretical models indicate that the off - center potential minima of the six rare earth sites ( see figure  [ fig1](a ) ) could give rise to local phonons and enhance the electron - phonon interaction in the filled skutterudites .",

    "these models have been used to explain the large magnetic - field - independent @xmath75 in smos@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite previous ultrasonic measurements show an extra mode in ndos@xmath0sb@xmath1 at @xmath52  k  [ ] ; it and the above - mentioned smos@xmath0sb@xmath1 are the only two skutterudites displaying this ultrasonic anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the contrast between the relatively low cyclotron effective masses in ndos@xmath0sb@xmath1 and its relatively high @xmath43 value is therefore probably due to the local phonon modes .",
    "magnetometry and high - frequency conductivity measurements have been made on single crystals of ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 and ndos@xmath0sb@xmath1 using temperatures down to 0.5  k and magnetic fields of up to 60  tesla .",
    "the data show that ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 undergoes a field - induced transition from a semimetal l phase into a high - field , high - temperature h phase characterized by a single , almost spherical fermi - surface section .",
    "the general behaviour of the phase transition and comparisons with models of the bandstructure lead us to propose that the field - induced phase transition in ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 is similar in origin to the well - known @xmath4 transition in ce and its alloys  @xcite .",
    "the phase boundary appears to exhibit an unusual curvature at low temperatures , possibly due to quantum fluctuations associated with the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "by contrast , the behavior of ndos@xmath0sb@xmath1 is relatively straightforward ; it has a similar fermi surface topology to that of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 , but with significantly smaller effective masses .",
    "this result supports the importance of local phonon modes in contributing to the low - temperature heat capacity of ndos@xmath0sb@xmath1 . the original motivation for this study  to investigate whether the superconductivity in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 arises from close proximity to afm and fm quantum - critical points , with the more explicitly magnetic ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 and ndos@xmath0sb@xmath1 lying on the either side of the postulated quantum phase transitions ",
    "is borne out in part .",
    "ndos@xmath0sb@xmath1 and pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 indeed look like close relatives , with the heavier quasiparticle masses in the latter favoring superconductivity .",
    "but any resemblance of ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1 to the other two skutterudites is overwhelmed by the kondo physics that is often writ large in ce and its compounds .",
