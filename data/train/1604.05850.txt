    "if the operator function @xmath9 is constant , these equations may be solved using the concept of maximal parabolic regularity , see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "these results are mostly to be seen as perturbation results , with respect to an _ autonomous _ parabolic operator .",
    "the spirit of our paper is perturbative in a different sense : not the operator is changed , but the banach space .",
    "this enables us to extrapolate maximal parabolic regularity for whole classes of non - autonomous operators simultaneously . remarkably , grger proved in @xcite that maximal parabolic @xmath13-regularity for second - order divergence - form operators is preserved in case of non - smooth , time - dependent coefficients , if one deviates from @xmath14 to temporal and spatial integrability exponents @xmath15 in an interval @xmath16 that depends on the ellipticity constant and the @xmath17-norm of the coefficient function . here",
    ", we provide an abstract extrapolation strategy that includes general non - autonomous operators corresponding to sesquilinear forms , and we extend the results of grger to indices @xmath18 and more general geometric settings for mixed boundary conditions .",
    "in the first part of the paper , we develop an abstract framework which allows to show maximal parabolic @xmath19-regularity for _ non - autonomous _ operators in a banach space @xmath8 and for some @xmath20 , provided that one knows maximal parabolic regularity for suitable _ autonomous _ operators . later on",
    "we specify @xmath8 to be @xmath21 ( see definition [ d-1 ] below ) and @xmath6 to be a second - order divergence operator @xmath22 .",
    "we aim at situations in which the map in is substantially discontinuous , which means that it is allowed to be discontinuous in every point @xmath23 of the time interval @xmath24 , and does _ not _ satisfy the already weak condition of relative continuity in @xcite .",
    "a prototype for this is the following : for each time @xmath25 there is a moving subdomain @xmath26 on which the coefficient function @xmath27 is constant and it takes a different constant value on @xmath28 , see section  [ snonaut8 ] .",
    "the banach spaces @xmath8 of type @xmath29 turn out to be well suited for the treatment of elliptic and parabolic problems if these are combined with inhomogeneous neumann boundary conditions ( cf .",
    "* section  3.3 ) for @xmath30 ) or if right hand sides of distributional type appear , e.g.  surface densities , which may even vary their position in time , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "note that there is often an intrinsic connection between ( spatial ) jumps in the coefficient function and the appearance of surface densities as parts of the right hand side ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  1 ) ) .",
    "interestingly , these spaces are also adequate for the treatment of control problems , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the advantage of @xmath29 over @xmath31 is that the domain of elliptic divergence operators continuously embeds into a hlder space if @xmath32 is larger than the space dimension ( cf .",
    "@xcite @xcite ) , which is helpful when considering quasilinear problems , see section  [ snonaut00 ] below and cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite in the continuous setting .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the @xmath33 spaces , the space @xmath29 satisfies the property that the domains of divergence operators @xmath34 coincide at different points in time even if the discontinuities of the coefficient functions @xmath27 move in @xmath35 , see the examples in section  [ snonaut6 ] , taken from @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we next give an outline of the paper .",
    "we first recall preliminary results on maximal parabolic regularity and a quantitative version of sneiberg s extrapolation principle .",
    "then we prove an interpolation result for different spaces of maximal parabolic regularity , i.e.  we prove the interpolation identity @xmath36_\\theta   = l^r(j;[d , e]_\\theta ) \\cap w_0^{1,r}(j;[x , y]_\\theta),\\ ] ] in which @xmath37 and @xmath38 and @xmath39 form a _ pair of common maximal parabolic regularity _ , see definition [ d - commonpair ] below . having this at hand , one can extrapolate maximal parabolic regularity from one setting to ` neighbouring ones ' , see theorem  [ t - extrapolatabstr ] .",

    "we show that the exponent of time integrability extrapolates from @xmath12 to @xmath0 without losing maximal parabolic regularity and provide quantitative estimates on the size of @xmath11 in theorem  [ thm - e - hilbert ] .",
    "a detailed motivation for these type of results is given at the end of section [ snonaut3 ] . in section  [ snonaut5 ]",
    "we introduce the precise setting of the elliptic differential operators in divergence form with mixed boundary conditions which we use in the remainder of the paper . in section  [ snonaut6 ]",

    "we show that non - autonomous operators @xmath42 satisfy maximal parabolic @xmath43-regularity if @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the coefficient function @xmath46 can be discontinuous in time and space .",
