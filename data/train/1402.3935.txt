    "interaction of antikaon with nucleon is the basis for investigation of atomic and strong quasi - bound states in antikaonic - nucleus systems .",
    "available two - body experimental information on @xmath0 interaction is insufficient for construction of a unique interaction model . in particular , it was shown in  @xcite that phenomenological models of the interaction having one or two poles for the @xmath9 resonance reproducing all low - energy experimental data on @xmath1 scattering and kaonic hydrogen equally well can be constructed . a way to obtaine some additional information about",
    "the @xmath0 interaction is to use it as an input in an accurate few - body calculation and then compare the theoretical predictions with eventual experimental data .",
    "there are several calculations devoted to the low - energy @xmath2 scattering  @xcite or the @xmath2 scattering length only  @xcite based on faddeev equations .",
    "low - energy @xmath2 amplitudes , including scattering length , and effective range were calculated in our papers  @xcite . in the most recent one  @xcite",
    "the directly measurable characteristics of @xmath6 level of kaonic deuterium were calculated as well .",
    "it allows the direct comparison of the theoretical predictions with eventual experimental data on kaonic deuterium , which hopefully will be obtained in siddharta-2 experiment  @xcite .",
    "the results were obtained by solving coupled - channel faddeev - type ags equations with phenomenological @xmath0 potentials . however ,",
    "many other authors of @xmath0 interaction models use not a phenomenological , but a chirally - motivated potential , where a @xmath0 amplitude obtained from a chiral lagrangian is used as a potential to determine the position of the poles of @xmath9 resonance .",
    "bethe - salpeter or lippmann - schwinger equations are used for this task .",
    "there are quite a few such chirally - motivated potentials available , however , none of them is suited for use in faddeev calculations since either they have too many coupled channels and can not be used as it is or they are not as accurate in reproducing experimental data as one would wish .",
    "therefore , we decided to construct a new chirally - motivated model of @xmath0 interaction , which can be used in dynamically accurate three - body calculations .",
    "the potential reproduces the low - energy data on @xmath1 scattering and kaonic hydrogen with the same level of accuracy as our previously constructed phenomenological @xmath0 potentials .",
    "we repeated our calculation of the low - energy @xmath2 elastic scattering and the characteristics of kaonic deuterium using the new model of @xmath0 interaction and compared the new results with those obtained using phenomenological @xmath0 potentials .",
    "since the three - body ags equations and the rest of the two - body input are the same in both calculations , we could isolate the pure effect of the different types of @xmath0 interaction models .",

    "most of them are not really suited for use in faddeev calculations since they have too many coupled channels .",
    "recently , one more of these @xmath0 potentials was constructed  @xcite together with a reduced version , which contains only three channels .",
    "therefore , this last one , in principle , could be used in a dynamically correct few - body calculation , however , the reduced version does not reproduce @xmath1 experimental data accurately enough .",
    "the commonly used @xmath11-wave chirally - motivated potentials have the energy - dependent part ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath12 and are written in particle basis .",

    "baryon mass @xmath15 , baryon energy @xmath16 and meson energy @xmath17 of the channel @xmath18 enter the factors , which ensure proper normalization of the amplitude .",

    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 stand for the initial , final relative momenta and the total energy , respectively .",

    "it is seen that the @xmath6 level shift @xmath45 and width @xmath48 of kaonic hydrogen of the @xmath21 are in agreement with the most recent experimental data of siddharta collaboration  @xcite . comparing the data in table  [ phys_char.tab ] with those from table 2 of  @xcite we see that the chirally motivated potential @xmath21 gives @xmath6 level shift @xmath45 and width @xmath48 of kaonic hydrogen , which is close to the results of the one - pole @xmath54 and the two - pole @xmath55 versions of the phenomenological potential .",
    "the chirally motivated potential also reproduces the rather accurately measured threshold branching ratios @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 : @xmath56 @xmath57 the medium value of the threshold branching ratio @xmath35 and of the @xmath58 constructed from the @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( see eqs.(7,10 ) of  @xcite ) are reproduced by the phenomenological potential as well , therefore , we can say that all three potentials reproduce the experimental data equally well .",
    "the same is true for the elastic and inelastic @xmath1 cross - sections @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . in order to demonstrate ,",
    "that all three potentials reproduce the cross - sections with the same accuracy , we plotted the results of @xmath21 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 model of interaction in the same figure , see figure  [ kp_cross_sect.fig ] .",
    "the experimental data in the figure are taken from  @xcite .",
    "as previously , one set of data  @xcite is neglected due to large experimental errors .        unlike most of the authors of models of @xmath0 interaction we need not know @xmath1 scattering length @xmath64 to calculate the characteristics of kaonic hydrogen .",
    "however , we can calculate it directly from the @xmath21 potential , its value is @xmath65 the isospin zero and one @xmath0 scattering lengths @xmath66 are not connected with the @xmath64 value by a simple formula since physical masses are used while the @xmath21 is constructed together with isospin nonconserving coulomb interaction .",
    "put in three - body ags equations , however , isospin averaged masses are used , which lead to different values of the scattering lengths : @xmath67    in the same way as other chirally - motivated potentials , our new potential has two strong poles for the @xmath9 resonance : @xmath68 both are situated on the proper riemann sheets , corresponding to a resonance in @xmath30 channel and a quasi - bound state in @xmath0 channel .",
    "they are connected to @xmath31 channel too through isospin nonconserving parts .",
    "the real parts of the poles are situated between the @xmath0 and @xmath30 thresholds as one would expect .",
    "the two - pole structure of the @xmath9 resonance follows from the energy - dependent form of the potential . to achieve the same property of our two - pole phenomenological potential @xmath55 we used a more complicated form - factor in the @xmath30 channel .",
    "in the same way as in  @xcite we checked , where the poles move when the nondiagonal couplings of the potential were gradually reduced to zero .",
    "the results are demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ strongpoles_polemove.fig ] .",
    "it is seen , that the strong pole @xmath69 becomes a real bound state with smaller than the original binding energy when the @xmath0 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 channels are uncoupled .",
    "the second strong pole @xmath70 remains a resonance pole , situated between the @xmath0 and @xmath30 channels , but with smaller real and larger imaginary parts . the same trajectory drawn for the @xmath6 level shift and width of kaonic hydrogen ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ kpatom_polemove.fig ] , shows that the pole , corresponding to the atomic state , also becomes a real bound state .",
    "the @xmath6 level shift is large for the decoupled system .",
    "theoretically , the @xmath9 resonance peak could be seen in the elastic @xmath71 cross - sections , however , the corresponding experimental peak can be observed only as an fsi peak in a more complicated reaction involving three or more particles . in this case",
    "the virtual @xmath72 process can also contribute to the @xmath30 yield in a final state .",
    "the extent of this contribution can be reliably determined only by considering the complete , rather complicated process ( see e.g. eq.(11 ) in  @xcite ) .",
    "instead , many authors of @xmath0 interaction models add the @xmath72 amplitude to the @xmath73 one and introduce an adjustable parameter in front of it to compare the theoretical predictions with experimental @xmath30 missing mass spectra .",
    "the corresponding cross - sections are multiplied by @xmath30 relative momentum , which is a phase space factor coming from the fsi formalism .",
    "we did not follow that routine and demonstrate the effect of @xmath9 resonance in elastic @xmath71 cross - sections , see figure  [ pi0sig0.fig ] .",
    "we solved faddeev - type equations in alt - grassberger - sandhas form for the @xmath3 system with coupled @xmath4 channel , the formulas can be found in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "the equations properly describe three - body dynamics of the system .",
    "they are written in momentum representation , isospin formalism is used .",
    "the equations were properly antisymmetrised , which is necessary due to two baryons in every channel .",
    "the logarithmic singularities in the kernels of the equations were treated by the method suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the three - body calculations were performed without taking coulomb interaction into account since the effect of it is expected to be small .",
    "the elastic @xmath2 amplitudes , including the scattering length , and effective range were calculated using the chirally - motivated @xmath74 potential described in the previous section .",
    "we used averaged masses in the potential as well as in the the whole three - body calculation since it was shown in  @xcite that the effect of physical masses is rather small .",
    "the three - channel @xmath10 potential was used in the @xmath75 ags equations in a form of the exact optical two - channel @xmath76 potential , when the @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 elements of the three - channel @xmath80-matrix are used as the two - channel @xmath80-matrix .",
    "the remaining two - body potentials , needed for the three - body calculation , are also separable .",
    "the two - term tsa - b @xmath81 and the exact optical @xmath82 potentials , which were used , are described in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath81 model of interaction reproduces phase shifts of argonne v18 potential , therefore , is repulsive at short distances .",
    "it gives proper @xmath81 scattering length , effective range and binding energy of deuteron .",
    "the two - channel @xmath83 potential reproduces experimental @xmath84 and @xmath85 cross - sections , the corresponding exact optical @xmath82 potential has exactly the same elastic @xmath84 amplitude as the two - channel potential .",
    "the @xmath2 scattering length @xmath86 obtained with the chirally - motivated potential is shown in table  [ akd.tab ] .",
    "the new three - body result is compared to those from  @xcite with one- @xmath54 and two - pole @xmath55 versions of phenomenological @xmath0 potential .",
    "the `` phenomenological '' results in the table slightly differ from the three - body values from table  2 of  @xcite since here we used the spin - independent @xmath82 potential , while the spin - dependent was used in the previous paper .",
    "it is seen , that the chirally motivated potential leads to about @xmath87 larger absolute value of the real and the imaginary part of the scattering length .",
    "the difference is quite small , so we can conclude , that the three different models of @xmath0 interaction , which reproduce low - energy data on @xmath1 scattering and kaonic hydrogen with the same level of accuracy , give quite similar results for low - energy @xmath2 scattering .",
    "since it was shown  @xcite that fixed scatterer approximation , also called fixed center approximation , gives very large error for the @xmath2 system , this time we do not compare the results obtained with this method with ours .",
    "four @xmath86 values obtained in other faddeev calculations are shown in table  [ akd.tab ] . comparing to them , we see that the result of the very recent calculation with coupled channels  @xcite gives real part of @xmath86 , which almost coincides with our result for chirally motivated potential .",
    "the imaginary part of the @xmath2 scattering length from  @xcite is slightly larger , which can follow form the fact that the model of @xmath0 interaction used there was fitted to kaonic hydrogen data not directly , but through the @xmath1 scattering length and the approximate formula , which is the least reliable just in reproducing the imaginary part of the level shift .",
    "the one - channel result of faddeev calculation  @xcite lies far away from all the others .",
    "two effects play their role here : a one - channel dynamics and , therefore , indirect taking @xmath4 channel into account and problems with reproducing experimental data by the complex @xmath0 potential .",
    "it was demonstrated in  @xcite for phenomenological models of @xmath0 interaction that simple complex potentials have quite large error , while an exact optical @xmath0 potential gives rather accurate result for the scattering length .",
    "the exact optical potential with @xmath0 amplitudes exactly corresponding to those from the potential with coupled channels is good for the chirally motivated model as well .",
    "it gives @xmath88 which is very close to the coupled - channel result from table  [ akd.tab ] .",
    "finally , two old @xmath86 values  @xcite significantly underestimate the imaginary part of the @xmath2 scattering length .",

    "they are presented in @xmath105 form in figure  [ kctgdelta.fig ] .",
    "the relative values of @xmath106 and @xmath107 obtained with all three our potentials together with their signs might lead to the conclusion that a bound or a quasi - bound state could exist in the @xmath2 system . however , this conclusion is not true .",
    "we solved an eigenvalue problem using the same ags equations and found that such a state does not exist .",
    "details of the calculations can be found in our next paper , devoted to the quasi - bound state in @xmath108 system .",
    "the reason why the estimation is not reliable is that it is based on the effective range expansion of a scattering amplitude .",
    "the expansion allows to derive simple relations between a scattering length and a bound state of a system , however , its validity is limited to the vicinity of the corresponding threshold .",
    "since the @xmath2 state is expected to have rather large width , it is definitely out of such a region .",
    "the only @xmath0 potential , which gives a quasi - bound state in @xmath2 system , is one of our older phenomenological potentials  @xcite , which does not reproduce siddharta , but kek data on kaonic hydrogen  @xcite only .",
    "our aim was to calculate a physical quantity , which characterizes low - energy properties of @xmath2 system and can be compared to experimental data directly .",
    "the scattering length is not of this type , while the @xmath6 level shift and width of kaonic deuterium can be measured .",
    "therefore , we calculated these atomic observables , which correspond to the results of our three - body calculations of low - energy @xmath2 scattering .",
    "since faddeev calculation with coulomb plus strong interaction is too hard , a two - body calculation with a complex @xmath5 potential was performed instead .",
    "the potential is a separable one with two terms @xmath109 and yamaguchi form - factors @xmath110 the parameters of the potential @xmath111 were fixed by fitting the three - body @xmath2 amplitudes calculated using the ags equations , described in the previous section .",
    "obviously , the potential  ( [ vkd ] ) reproduces the scattering length @xmath86 and effective range @xmath89 from table  [ akd.tab ] .",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation with the complex @xmath5 and coulomb potentials was then solved and the @xmath6 level energy was obtained .",
    "more details about the calculation can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the shift @xmath90 and width @xmath91 of kaonic deuterium , corresponding to the chirally motivated model of @xmath10 interaction are shown in table  [ akd.tab ] .",
    "we also show the characteristics of the atom , obtained with our phenomenological potentials @xmath54 and @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "the `` chirally motivated '' absolute values of the level shift @xmath112 and the width @xmath113 are both larger than those obtained in  @xcite for the phenomenological @xmath114 potentials .",
    "keeping in mind the results for the @xmath2 scattering lengths discussed in the previous section it is an expected result since the @xmath6 level shift and width of an hadronic atom are directly connected to the strong scattering length of the system .",
    "however , the results obtained using three different models of @xmath0 interaction are rather close to each other .",
    "we think , that the important point here is the fact that all three potentials reproduce low - energy experimental data on @xmath1 scattering and kaonic hydrogen with the same level of accuracy .",
    "we checked the accuracy of the approximate corrected deser formula , allowing simple computation of characteristics of a kaonic atom from a known scattering length .",
    "the result obtained using the @xmath86 value from table  [ akd.tab ] : @xmath115 compared to more accurate ones @xmath116 , @xmath117 from the same table show that in this case the error of the approximate formula is as large as for the case of phenomenological @xmath0 potentials .",
    "as in  @xcite , the corrected deser formula underestimates the width of the @xmath6 level of kaonic deuterium by @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , the validity of this statement does not depend on the model of the @xmath0 interaction",
    ".    we would like to note that our results for the @xmath116 and @xmath117 , shown in table  [ akd.tab ] can not be called `` exact '' , but only `` accurate '' since the @xmath6 level shift and width were obtained from the two - body calculation with a point - like deuteron , interacting with a kaon through the complex potential .",
    "it means that the size of deuteron was taken into account only effectively through the potential , which reproduces the three - body @xmath2 ags amplitudes . as for the corrected deser formula",
    ", it contains no three - body information at all since the only input is a @xmath2 scattering length .",
    "moreover , the formula relies on further approximations , which are absent in our calculation , and give a @xmath119 error already for the two - body case .",
    "we constructed three - channel isospin dependent chirally - motivated @xmath10 potential and used it in the faddeev - type calculations of the low - energy elastic @xmath2 amplitudes , including @xmath2 scattering length , and effective range .",
    "the potential reproduces all low - energy experimental data on @xmath1 scattering and characteristics of kaonic hydrogen with the same level of accuracy as our phenomenological potentials with one- and two - pole structure of @xmath9 resonance .",
    "comparison of the results allows to reveal the effect of the three different models of @xmath0 interaction used in the three - body calculations .",
    "it turnes out that low - energy @xmath2 elastic amplitudes and characteristics of kaonic deuterium obtained with the three potentials are rather close .",
    "therefore , comparison with eventual results of an experiment on kaonic deuterium hardly could choose one of the models of @xmath0 interaction .",
