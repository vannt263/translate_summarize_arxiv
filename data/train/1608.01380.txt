    "the quality factor of the helmholtz resonance for the borosilicate device plateaus at a value of @xmath22 , below 1  k. to understand this limitation , we studied the behavior of the fundamental drum - like mode of an empty device , fig .  [",
    "fig : drumlike ] .",
    "in this situation , the damping arises from internal dissipation in the substrate . the resonance frequency , @xmath23 , of this mechanical mode is approximately @xmath24  khz at the base temperature of our @xmath8he fridge ( @xmath25  mk ) . up to @xmath26",

    ", of the drum - like mode as a function of temperature .",
    "( b ) resonance frequency , @xmath23 , of the drum - like mode as a function of temperature .",
    "as explained in the text , the features of those two curves can be explained by the standard tunneling model of two - level systems @xcite . ]",
    "the dissipation , @xmath27 , of the drum - like resonance displays a more complex temperature dependence , and yet the behavior of both the @xmath28 and @xmath23 can be understood through the standard tunneling model of two - level systems for amorphous materials @xcite . here , the analogy with the measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite is striking , as @xmath28 reproduces all the standard features of such systems . from @xmath25 mk to 1 k the dissipation increases with increasing temperature . above 1 k and up to 5 k , @xmath28 plateaus at a value of @xmath29 .",
    "finally a large peak is observed with a maximum value of @xmath30 at 55 k.    it is important to notice that the drum - like mode has a resonance frequency @xmath31 times higher than the helmholtz resonance frequency , and the frequency dependence of the dissipation must be considered .",
    "the dissipation of two - level systems as a function of frequency has been measured by several groups @xcite in amorphous sio@xmath32 .",
    "their measurements show that as the frequency is lowered , the temperature of the transition into the plateau region is lowered , down to @xmath33 mk at @xmath34  khz .",
    "the value of the dissipation in the plateau region , however , remains unchanged .",
    "therefore , we expect that in the temperature range ( from 475 mk to @xmath35 ) , where the helmholtz resonance is observed , the internal dissipation of the borosilicate is equal to that in the plateau region , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath29 . in supplement c",
    "we showed that @xmath36% of the potential energy is stored in the substrate , therefore we predict that the helmholtz quality factor in the borosilicate device should be @xmath37 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the value of @xmath38 measured , confirming that the limitation in the quality factor of the resonator is indeed coming from the internal dissipation of the borosilicate .",
    "the helmholtz resonance in the borosilicate device was found to be limited by internal dissipation in the substrate material due to two - level systems . fabricating",
    "a helmholtz resonator from single crystal z - cut quartz substantially reduced the losses of the resonator , however we found that the low temperature behavior is still dominated by internal dissipation in the substrate .",
    "modeling of the low temperature dissipation is based on a two - level systems ensemble model , similar to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe dissipation in single crystal diamond nanoresonators .",
    "when the energy splitting of the two - level systems , @xmath39 , is modulated by the mechanical oscillations , energy is transferred to the two - level systems , with an efficiency depending on the occupation probability of the two - level systems .",
    "the quality factor , @xmath40 , associated with this process is given by : @xmath41 here @xmath42 with @xmath43 the boltzmann constant , @xmath44 is the maximum dissipation in the substrate material such that @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the percentage of potential energy stored in the bending of the substrate , as explained in supplement c. applying this model to the low temperature portion ( @xmath47  mk ) of the dissipation of the helmholtz resonance in the quartz device yields @xmath48 and @xmath49  ghz .",
    "measurement of the drum - like mode , similar to the one performed for the borosilicate device , was made using the quartz device , fig .",
    "[ fig : drumlikequartz ] . due to the thinner quartz substrate , the resonance frequency is lower at @xmath50  khz , fig .",
    "[ fig : drumlikequartz](a ) .",
    "it should be noted that the temperature range ( @xmath51  mk to @xmath52  k ) covered by this measurement is different than the temperature range used in the case of the borosilicate resonator ( @xmath53  mk to @xmath33  k ) due to the cryogenic apparatus used to perform the experiment .",
    "the internal dissipation of the quartz substrate for the drum - like mode measured in fig .",
    "[ fig : drumlikequartz](b ) plateaus at a value of @xmath54 , markedly lower than the dissipation measured for the helmholtz resonance mode in the quartz device at @xmath10  khz .",
    "this could be explained by the fact that the dissipation associated with two - level systems in crystalline materials depends on the measurement frequency , as has been observed in single crystal silicon samples @xcite .",
    "those measurements showed that as the frequency is increased , the total dissipation is reduced .",
    "hence , fabricating a resonator with a scaled down geometry would present a twofold advantage . by increasing the helmholtz resonance frequency , the internal dissipation of the material would be reduced .",
    "also the contribution of the substrate to the motion would also reduced , decreasing the effective damping coming from the material .",
