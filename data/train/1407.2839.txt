    "given that in real materials the pairing of electrons is generally generated by strong local lattice deformations which trap electrons into small localized bipolarons , it became evident that such local pairs could not exist in form of itinerant charge carriers @xcite . searching a way out of this dilemma led me to propose that resonating localized bipolarons could achieve a phase fluctuation driven superconducting state on the basis of their transient nature .",

    "there are two energy scales which control the inter - dependence of ( i ) the onset of the pseudo - gap state out of a high temperature electronic magma parent state and ( ii ) the superconducting state , evolving out of this pseudo - gap state at low temperatures through a hole - doping induced phase first order phase transition .    the first one is given by the pairing energy , characterized by the temperature @xmath5 signalling the opening of pseudo - gap in the single - particle density of states .",
    "it is related to the generation of transient localized diamagnetic spin - singlet pairs on competing with each other cu@xmath1 - o - cu@xmath1 and cu@xmath3 - o - cu@xmath3 valence bonds , generating a finite fluctuating pairing amplitude , which monotonously decreases with increasing hole doping .",
    "the second one is given by the energy , required to phase lock together these transient localized electron pairs on adjacent fluctuating molecular clusters .",
    "this is achieved by their faculty to spontaneously decay into a pair of itinerant electrons , which establishes this phase correlation through andreev type scattering processes .",
    "the strogly hole doping dependent competition between inter - pair and intra - pair phase correlations dictates the phase transition by which the superconducting state , composed of spatially phase correlated transient localized bound electron - pairs , transits into the insulating pseudo - gap state with phase uncorrelated such bound electron - pairs .",
    "when the pairing energy outweighs the energy related to the phase stiffness , which links adjacent transient pairs as is the case for low doped cuprate htscs up to the optimally doped ones , the decreasing with hole doping @xmath42 pairing energy @xmath43 weakens the local intra - pair phase rigidity and thereby permits to strengthen the inter - pair phase stiffness . as a consequence , @xmath44 increases with increasing @xmath42 .",

    "beyond @xmath46 , the pairing energy @xmath43 , decreasing with increasing hole doping , takes over the control of a bcs like superconducting state triggered by amplitude fluctuations .",
    "these features are to a certain extent compatible with both of the two robust characteristics of the cuprate htscs : ( i ) their intrinsic dynamical local instabilities of the crystalline lattice and ( ii ) their strong electronic correlations which characterise a hole doped mott insulator , resulting in phil anderson s resonating valence bond ( rvb ) scenario @xcite .",
    "both of these scenarios lead one to a picture in which bare itinerant electrons , moving in planar cuo@xmath4 structures , get momentarily bound in form of resonating diamagnetic spin - singlet pairs on plaquettes composed of four cu cations . under certain provisos , the rvb scenario can be mapped into the phenomenological effective boson - fermion model ( bfm ) @xcite which had been advocated prior to the discovery of the cuprate htscs to capture the physics of metastability driven superconductivity .",
    "in an early mean field analysis @xcite of the bfm it indicated for the first time the potentiality of a pseudo - gap state controlled by amplitude fluctuations in a system of intrinsically localized transient bipolarons .",
    "the full implications of that had however been recognized @xcite only once the cuprates superconductors had been discovered .",
    "our investigations during the past two decades of meta - stability driven pairing in the cuprates on the basis of the bfm permitted us to predict the salient features of this pseudo - gap state : ( 1 ) the anomalous temperature dependence of this pseudo - gap @xcite , ( 2 ) the remnant bogoliubov modes @xcite and ( 3 ) to account for its transient meissner effect @xcite ) .",
    "with this background we restrict ourselves now to focus on the scenario of lattice metastability triggered superconductivity , which requires , to start with , to conjecture a corresponding to it quantum vacuum parent state .",

    "this , together with the strong positive isotope effect of the pairing energy @xmath43 @xcite and its being correlated to the pressure induced cu - o bond stretch mode frequency @xcite are strong indications that pairing in the cuprate htscs derive primarily from their intrinsic crystalline meta - stability .",
    "the local dynamical lattice deformations , involving directionally oriented fluctuating cu - o - cu bonds , are randomly oriented along the a and b direction .",
    "this breaks the rotational as well as translational local lattice symmetry on an atomic length scale , and thereby evades any onset of long range translational symmetry breaking , which could hinder the stabilization of a phase correlated super - fluid state .",
