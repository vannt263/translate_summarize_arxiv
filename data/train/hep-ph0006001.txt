    "exclusive nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays provide information of important dynamics such as penguin contributions , cp asymmetries , and weak and strong phases . however , it is difficult to analyze these processes because of their nonperturbative origin . to simplify",
    "the analysis , the factorization approximation ( fa ) has been applied to decay amplitudes , under which nonfactorizable and annihilation contributions are neglected , and factorizable contributions are expressed as products of wilson coefficients , meson decay constants , and hadronic transition form factors . in this paper",
    "we shall compare three approaches to nonleptonic charmless @xmath0 meson decays , which are more or less related to fa : the fa approach @xcite , the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite , and the beneke - buchalla - neubert - sachrajda ( bbns ) approach @xcite .",
    "we take the @xmath3 decays as an example , and explain how factorizable , nonfactorizable , and annihilation contributions , infrared - cutoff and scale dependences , and strong phases are treated in these approaches .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath3 decays is given by @xcite @xmath4\\ ; , \\label{hbk}\\ ] ] with the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xmath5 and the four - fermion operators @xmath6 where @xmath7 are color indices and @xmath8 a renormalization scale .",
    "decay amplitudes are written as @xmath9 with the meson momenta @xmath10 . for convenience , we assume @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the @xmath0 meson mass .",
    "the dependences on the renormalization scale @xmath8 cancel between the wilson coefficients @xmath15 and the hadronic matrix elements @xmath16 , such that the decay amplitudes are scale - independent ( and also scheme - independent ) . in the practical derivation of the effective hamiltonian ,",
    "an infrared cutoff for loop integrals needs to be introduced , since four - fermion amplitudes may contain soft divergences , which are related to nonperturbative dynamics involved in the matrix elements .",
    "if the infrared cutoff appears in the form that external fermions are off - shell , the derivation will even become gauge dependent @xcite .",
    "these potential infrared - cutoff and gauge dependences are usually hidden in the matrix elements .    in the fa approach the matrix element of , say ,",

    "the form factor itself is parametrized by models .",
    "though analyses are simple under fa , a serious problem arises .",
    "when decay amplitudes are expressed as the products of @xmath8-dependent wilson coeficients and @xmath8-independent hadronic form factors , they depend on the scale @xmath8 . a cure of this scale dependence has been proposed in @xcite , which will be discussed in sec .",
    "the pqcd approach to exclusive @xmath0 meson decays has been developed some time ago @xcite .",
    "pqcd is a method to separate hard components from a qcd process , which are treated by perturbation theory .",
    "nonperturbative components are organized in the form of hadron wave functions , which can be extracted from experimental data .",
    "this formalism , so - called factorization theorem , has been successfully applied to various semileptonic decays @xcite and nonleptonic ( charmed and charmless ) decays @xcite . for",
    "the @xmath3 decays , the hard amplitude involves six external on - shell quarks , four of which correspond to the four - fermion operators and two of which are the spectator quarks in the @xmath0 and @xmath24 mesons . since nonperturbative dynamics has been factored out , one can evaluate all possible feynman diagrams for the six - quark amplitude straightforwardly , which include both factorizable and nonfactorizable contributions .",
    "factorizable and nonfactorizable annihilation diagrams are also included .",
    "that is , fa is not necessary in the pqcd approach . without fa ,",
    "the scale independence can be achieved easily @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that nonperturbative meson wave functions , being universal , are the same for various topologies of diagrams in all decay modes , which contain the @xmath0 and @xmath24 mesons .",
    "recently , beneke _ et al .",
    "_ proposed an alternative formalism for two - body charmless @xmath0 meson decays @xcite .",
    "they claimed that factorizable contributions ( the form factor @xmath25 in this case ) are not calculable in pqcd , but nonfactorzable contributions are in the heavy quark limit .",
    "hence , the former are treated in the same way as in the fa approach , and expressed as products of wilson coefficients and @xmath25 .",
    "the latter , calculated as in the pqcd approach , are written as the convolutions of hard amplitudes with three @xmath26 meson wave functions .",
    "annihilation diagrams are neglected as in fa .",
    "therefore , this formalism can be regarded as a mixture of the fa and pqcd approaches .",
    "values of form factors at maximal recoil @xmath27 and nonperturbative meson wave functions are all treated as free parameters .",

    "note that final - state - interaction ( fsi ) effects are always assumed to be absent in the above three approaches .",
    "the neglect of fsi effects has been argued in @xcite .",
    "as stated in the introduction , a serious problem of fa is the dependence of physical predictions on the renormalization scale @xmath8 .",
    "a plausible solution to the aforementioned problem has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to extract a @xmath8-dependent evolution factor @xmath31 from the matrix element @xmath32 , and combine it with the @xmath8-dependent wilson coefficient @xmath33 : @xmath34 where the effective wilson coefficient @xmath35 is @xmath8-independent .",
    "the extraction of @xmath31 involves the mixing of effective operators below the scale @xmath8 and above the lower scale @xmath36 , @xmath36 being the @xmath37 quark mass . after making a physical amplitude explicitly scale - independent ,",
    "fa is applied to the matrix element at the tree level , @xmath38 this strategy has also been adopted in the bbns approach .",
    "the above issue is in fact much subtler .",
    "one - loop corrections to on - shell @xmath37 quark decay amplitudes are usually infrared divergent @xcite . to remove these infrared divergences ,",
    "the conventional treatment is to assume that external quarks are off - shell by @xmath39 .",
    "this assumption , however , results in a gauge dependence of one - loop corrections .",
    "the evolution factor @xmath31 then depends on an infrared cutoff @xmath39 and on a gauge parameter , which are originally implicit in the matrix element .",
    "therefore , the modified fa , though removes the scale dependence of a decay amplitude , often introduces the infrared - cutoff and gauge dependences .",
    "the controversy of the scale , infrared - cutoff and gauge dependences can be resolved in the pqcd approach @xcite . in this",
    "formalism partons , _",
    "i.e. _ , external quarks , are assumed to be on shell , and both ultraviolet and infrared divergences in radiative corrections are isolated using the dimensional regularization . with external quarks being on shell ,",
    "gauge invariance of a decay amplitude is guaranteed under radiative corrections .",
    "the ultraviolet poles are subtracted in a renormalization scheme .",
    "the infrared poles , which correspond to nonperturbative dynamics of decay processes , are absorbed into meson wave functions .",
    "how much finite piece of radiative corrections is absorbed into wave functions along with the infrared poles depends on a factorization scheme , or equivalently , on a factorization scale @xmath40 . in the pqcd approach",
    "@xmath40 has been chosen as the inverse of the meson transverse extent , @xmath41 .",
    "in other words , dynamics below ( above ) the factorization scale is absorbed into a nonperturbative wave function ( perturbative hard amplitude ) , and a decay amplitude is factorized into convolution of these two subprocesses .    for nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays , contributions above the factorization scale involve two scales : @xmath42 , at which the matching conditions of the effective weak hamiltonian to the full hamiltonian are defined , and the typical scale @xmath43 of a hard amplitude , which reflects specific dynamics of a decay mode .",
    "the scale @xmath43 , corresponding to the lower scale @xmath36 in the modified fa , is chosen as the maximal virtuality of internal particles in a hard amplitude .",
    "the analysis of next - to - leading - order corrections to the pion form factor @xcite has indicated that this choice minimizes higher - order corrections .    without assuming fa , the @xmath8 dependence of a decay amplitude is calculated based on six - fermion hard amplitudes in the pqcd approach .",
    "radiative corrections produce various types of logarithms : @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the renormalization - group ( rg ) summation of the first type of logarithms leads to the wilson coefficients @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ ude ] ) .",
    "the second and third types are summed into the evolution factor @xmath47 the above expression implies that @xmath48 in fact contains two pieces , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which are governed by different anomalous dimensions .",
    "the anomalous dimension of @xmath49 is the same as of @xmath33 .",
    "below the hard scale @xmath43 , loop corrections associated with spectator quarks contribute , such that the anomalous dimension of @xmath50 differs from that of @xmath49 @xcite .    insert eq .",
    "( [ g12 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ ude ] ) , the effective wilson coefficient is written as @xmath51 which consists of two stages of rg evolutions .",
    "we have extended the wilson evolution directly from @xmath42 down to @xmath43 without further considering the mixing of effective operators .",
    "the scale independence of a decay amplitude is thus constructed explicitly . the wilson evolution",
    "is then followed by the second - stage evolution from @xmath43 down to @xmath41 , which plays the role of the infrared cutoff @xmath39 .    together with the second - stage rg evolution",
    ", there also exists the sudakov evolution @xmath52 $ ] from the resummation of double logarithms @xmath53 @xcite , which arise from the overlap of collinear and soft divergences in radiative corrections to meson wave functions , @xmath54 denoting the dominant light - cone component of meson momentum .",
    "the effect of the sudakov evolution will be explained in the next section .",
    "after summing all various large logarithms , the hard amplitude @xmath55 can be evaluated at the characteristic scale @xmath43 perturbatively .",
    "@xmath55 contains all possible factorizable and nonfactorizable diagrams .    at last ,",
    "we address the treatment of the dependence on the factorization scale in the pqcd approach . both the hard amplitudes and the meson wave functions @xmath56 , @xmath57 being the momentum fraction associated with a valence quark ,",
    "depend on factorization schemes .",
    "for example , @xmath56 and @xmath58 are different .",
    "however , a decay amplitude , as convolution of the two subprocesses , does not depend on factorization schemes . the wave functions , though not calculable , are universal ( process - independent ) , since they absorb long - distance dynamics , which is insensitive to the specific decay of the @xmath37 quark into light quarks with large energy release . in the practical application @xmath59 for the factorization scale @xmath60 ,",
    "@xmath61 being a constant of order unity , can be determined from experimental data of some decay modes .",

    "in the fa approach factorizable contributions are expressed as products of wilson coefficients and transition form factors , which are then parametrized by some models .",
    "this treatment of factorizable contributions has also been adopted in the bbns approach .",
    "it has been argued that the @xmath21 transition form factor @xmath25 can not be evaluated in pqcd , because the on - shellness of internal particles in the hard amplitude is not suppressed by meson wave functions @xcite .",
    "for example , the lowest - order hard amplitude in fig .",
    "1 consists of the internal @xmath37 quark and gluon propagators proportional to @xmath65(k_1-k_3)^2}&=&\\frac{1}{(2p_1\\cdot k_3 ) ( 2k_1\\cdot k_3 ) } = \\frac{1}{x_1x_3 ^ 2 m_b^4}\\ ; , \\label{6 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) is the momentum of the spectator quark in the @xmath0 ( @xmath24 ) meson , and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) the corresponding momentum fraction as indicated in fig .  1 .",
    "to derive the above expression , we have neglected the mass difference @xmath70 .",
    "obviously , the pion wave function , if proportional to @xmath71 , does not remove the power divergence at @xmath72 from the on - shell internal particles .",
    "the assumption that internal particles in a hard amplitude should be off - shell is then violated , and pqcd is not applicable to @xmath25 .",
    "a different viewpoint has been adopted in the pqcd approach .",
    "since the end - point divergence is not of the pinched type , which is absorbed into a wave function , we argue that it can be either killed by a pion wave function vanishing faster than @xmath73 as @xmath72 , or smeared out by parton transverse momenta @xmath74 @xcite . including @xmath74 , eq .",

    "as argued in @xcite , partons can carry small amount of transverse momenta . when the end - point region with @xmath76 is not important , it is proper to approximate eq .",
    "( [ 6 m ] ) for the hard amplitude by eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , and the transverse degrees of freedom of partons in meson wave functions can be integrated out . when the end - point region is important as in the case of @xmath25 , one should keep @xmath74 for a consistent analysis .",
    "once the transverse degrees of freedom of partons are taken into account , the factorization of a qcd process should be performed in the @xmath37 space , @xmath37 being the variable conjugate to @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "this is how the factorization scale @xmath41 is introduced in the previous seciton .",
    "as stated before , the scale @xmath43 should be chosen as the maximal virtuality of internal particles in a hard amplitude , @xmath77 according to eq .",
    "( [ 6 m ] ) .",
    "the sudakov factor @xmath52 $ ] suppresses the long - distance contributions in the large @xmath37 region , and vanishes as @xmath78 , @xmath79 being the qcd scale .",
    "this factor then guarantees that most contributions to decay amplitudes come from the region with small coupling constant @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that 97% of the contribution to @xmath25 arises from the region with @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "it indicates that @xmath25 at large recoil of the pion is well within the perturbative regime , and that dynamics from hard gluon exchanges dominates .",
    "this is the reason pqcd with sudakov suppression is applicable to exclusive decays around the energy scale of the @xmath0 meson mass @xcite .",
    "the above conclusion is consistent with the following physical picture .",
    "the @xmath21 transition occurs via the @xmath82 decay with the outgoing @xmath83 quark being energetic .",
    "the spectator quark of the @xmath0 meson is more or less at rest .",
    "the probability that this spectator quark and the @xmath83 quark with large relative velocity form the pion is strongly suppressed by the pion wave function and by the sudakov factor .",
    "therefore , the process dominates , where a hard gluon is exchanged so that the two quarks are aligned to form the pion .",
    "we need to illuminate another concept about the application of pqcd .",
    "the smallness of pqcd predictions compared to experimental data does not definitely imply that perturbative contribution is not important @xcite .",
    "pqcd predictions depend on wave funcitons one adopts .",
    "for example , a smooth @xmath0 meson wave function decreases pqcd predictions for @xmath25 by a huge extent . however , this smooth @xmath0 meson wave function may not be correct , such that a conclusion drawn from it is not valid . in our analysis the @xmath0 meson and pion wave functions",
    "are determined from the data of the pion form factor and of the @xmath84 decays .",
    "we then employ the extracted wave funcitons to predict @xmath25 and examine the dominance of perturbative contributions . in this way",
    "the ambiguity in choosing wave functions and the model dependence of pqcd predictions are reduced .",
    "below we highlight the enhancement of penguin contributions observed in the pqcd approach , and its role in the explanation of the @xmath28 and @xmath85 data . for simplicity , we present the observation by means of the fa approach .",

    "the factor @xmath93 being negative , represents the ratio of the penguin contribution to the tree contribution in the @xmath94 mode , where @xmath95 is the kaon ( pion ) mass and @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath83 , and @xmath98 , the @xmath99 quark masses .",
    "it is obvious that the data @xmath100 @xcite imply the unitarity angle @xmath101 , no matter what @xmath102 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are .",
    "therefore , @xmath86 is an appropriate quantity for the determination of @xmath103 .",
    "while to determine @xmath103 from the data of the ratio @xmath104 @xcite , one must have precise information of @xmath102 , @xmath105 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "it can be shown that the extraction of @xmath103 from @xmath87 depends on these parameters sensitively .",
    "hence , @xmath87 is not an appropriate quantity for the determination of @xmath103 . to explain @xmath104 , a large @xmath106 corresponding to @xmath107 mev and a large @xmath108",
    "must be adopted in the fa approach @xcite .",
    "this is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ rkpi ] ) , since a large @xmath103 leads to a constructive interference between the first and second terms in the numerator of @xmath87 . in the modified fa approach with effective number of colors @xmath109 , a large unitarity angle @xmath110",
    "is also concluded @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether one can explain @xmath104 using reasonable quark masses @xmath111 mev and a smaller @xmath112 , if the extraction from @xmath86 is given a higher weight .",
    "the answer is positive in the pqcd approach .",
    "an essential difference between the fa and bbns approaches and the pqcd approach is that transition form factors can be calculated in the latter as argued above .",
    "therefore , we do not assume that the form factors associated with the wilson coefficients @xmath113 and with @xmath114 are the same .",
    "an explicit pqcd calculation indicates that the ratios @xmath115 are more complicate , which reduce to eq .",
    "( [ ptr ] ) only in some extreme kinematic conditions of partons @xcite . moreover , the choice of the hard scale @xmath43 , at which wilson coefficients are evaluated , is also different .",
    "it is chosen arbitrarily as @xmath36 or @xmath116 in the fa and bbns approaches , but as virtuality of internal particles of a hard amplitude in pqcd , such that evolution effects vary among the above form factors .",
    "it has been noticed that @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 have dramatically different @xmath8 dependences for @xmath120 : @xmath121 and @xmath122 increase with the decrease of @xmath8 faster than @xmath123 .",
    "the choice of the scale in pqcd makes possible that @xmath43 runs to below @xmath116 , and that penguin contributions are enhanced over tree contributions .",
    "it has been observed that the evolution effect enhances the ratios @xmath124 by about 50% @xcite .",
    "hence , even adopting @xmath111 mev , we can account for @xmath104 using @xmath112 .",
    "that is , the data of @xmath87 do not demand large @xmath103 .",
    "we emphasize that the hard scale @xmath43 with an average 1.4 gev , corresponding to @xmath125 , is still large enough to guarantee the applicability of pqcd @xcite .",
    "nonfactorizable contributions are neglected in the fa approach . however",
    ", it has been known that this approximation is not always appropriate , especially for the decay modes , whose factorizable amplitudes are proportional to the wilson coefficient @xmath126 . since @xmath127 is small , factorizable contributions and nonfactorizable contributions are of the same order , and the latter become important .",
    "this is the reason it is difficult to resolve the controversy in the branching ratios of the @xmath128 decays in fa @xcite .",
    "the conventional way to introduce nonfactorizable contributions is to vary number of colors in the wilson coeficients @xmath129 .",
    "the resultant effective number of colors , @xmath109 , being process - dependent parameters , render the fa approach less predictive .",
    "to go beyond fa , it has been proposed to evaluate nonfactorizable amplitudes for two - body charmless @xmath0 meson decays using pqcd factorization theorem in the bbns approach @xcite .",
    "the motivation is that the power divergence appearing in @xmath25 does not exist in nonfactorizable amplitudes , since soft divergences cancel between the two diagrams in fig",
    ".  2 @xcite .",
    "hence , these diagrams contribute to the hard parts of the @xmath3 decays , and are calculable in pqcd .",
    "we emphasize that the above soft cancellation is not sufficient to justify the applicability of pqcd .",
    "no matter what value @xmath14 is , one can always obtain the soft cancellation between the two nonfactorizable diagrams .",
    "however , it is obvious that pqcd is not applicable to @xmath0 meson decays if @xmath14 is as low as 1 gev .",
    "the criterion for the applicability of pqcd is stronger : pqcd is applicable only when higher - order corrections to decay amplitudes are under control .",
    "we shall show explicitly , following the reasoning in @xcite , that the simple factorization formula in @xcite for a nonfactorizable amplitude suffers large higher - order corrections .",

    "in the approaches where annihilation contributions are neglected , strong phases must be introduced via the bander - silverman - soni ( bss ) mechanism shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) @xcite .",
    "however , this mechanism , contributing through a charm quark loop , is suppressed by the charm mass threshold @xcite : @xmath168 @xmath169 being the @xmath61 quark mass .",
    "obviously , the large @xmath170 and @xmath73 regions are not favored by the pion wave funtion in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) . .",
    "moreover , the diagram with a charm quark loop is of higher order in the pqcd formalism .",
    "an exact numerical analysis has indicated that the imaginary contribution from the bss mechanism is smaller than that from the annihilation diagrams by a factor 10 @xcite .",
    "another source of strong phases in the fa and bbns approaches is the diagrams in fig .",
    "4(b ) , whose imaginary contributions appear in the effective wilson coefficients in eqs.(4)-(8 ) of @xcite , for instance , @xmath171 with @xmath172 and @xmath173 being real .",
    "we emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ fpi ] ) is derived from a configuration , in which the outgoing @xmath174 quark carries the full pion momentum .",
    "again , this configuration is strongly suppressed by the pion wave function and by the sudakov factor .",
    "that is , the imaginary contribution from the above source has been overestimated .    below",
    "we make a quantative comparision among the fa , bbns and pqcd approaches .",
    "figure 3 collects all the feynman diagrams for the hard amplitude of the @xmath175 decay , including factorizable and nonfactorizable tree , penguin and annihilation diagrams , whose contributions are listed in table i. the results obtained in the bbns approach are also shown .",
    "the fa results are the same as the bbns ones , but with the nonfactorizable amplitudes neglected .",
    "we observe    1 .",
    "the tree contributions are almost equal in the three approaches , but the penguin contributions are larger in pqcd , corresponding to a larger ratio @xmath176 defined by eq .",
    "( [ ptr ] ) ( about twice of those in fa and bbns ) , _ i.e. _ , corresponding to the dynamical penguin enhancement .",
    "2 .   the tree and penguin contributions are real in pqcd , but complex in fa and bbns due to the complex effective wilson coefficients , which are the main source of strong phases in fa and bbns .",
    "the annihilation contributions are neglected in fa and bbns , but of the same order as the penguin contributions in pqcd , which are the main source of strong phases in pqcd .",
    "4 .   nonfactorizable contributions are complex in pqcd but real in bbns , as explained in the previous section , and neglected in fa .",
    "note that different @xmath0 and @xmath24 meson wave functions have been employed as deriving the results in table i @xcite .",
    "nonfactorizable contributions are destructive relative to the penguin contributions , if concering only the real parts , and negligible for the @xmath3 branching ratios in both approaches .",
    "the dominant nonfactorizable contribution @xmath177 in bbns is due to the sharp hard parts in the end - point regions of momentum fractions @xmath57 as stated in sec .",
    "the total tree and penguin contributions , including both factorizable , nonfactorizable and annihilation ones , are @xmath178    the tree contributions obtained in the three approaches are very close .",
    "the signs of the penguin contributions are different , and the magnitude in pqcd is larger than those in fa and bbns : @xmath179 the difference in the total penguin contributions is attributed to the treatment of nonfactorizable and annihilation duagrams .",
    "we emphasize that the bbns results depend on the parameters for factorizable contributions ( the transition form factors ) and the parameters for nonfactorizable contributions ( the meson wave funcitons ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible to reverse the sign and to increase the magnitude of the penguin contribution by varying these parameters .",
    "the penguin contribution in the bbns approach is smallest because of the cancellation between @xmath180 and @xmath177 . if expressing the amplitudes of the @xmath181 decay as @xmath182 with @xmath54 and @xmath183 given in eq .",
    "( [ ppbb ] ) , the strong phases @xmath184 are about @xmath185    the predictions for the cp asymmetry of the @xmath30 decays are presented in fig .",
    "5 . because of eq .",
    "( [ pra ] ) , the cp asymmetry in pqcd is larger than that ( @xmath186 at most ) in fa and much larger than that ( @xmath187 at most ) in bbns . because of eq .",
    "( [ sp ] ) , the sign of the cp asymmetry in pqcd is opposite to those in fa and bbns .",
    "if the @xmath0 meson wave function in @xcite with @xmath188 gev is adopted , @xmath177 and also @xmath189 will increase accordingly , such that the cp asymmetry in the bbns approach becomes a bit larger .",
    "we shall leave the resolution of the above discrepancies to future measurements of cp asymmetries .",
    "that is , experimental data of cp asymmetries will provide an appropriate test of the three approaches .",
    "note that all the three approaches give the similar branching ratio @xmath190 , which is consistent with the cleo data @xcite .    as argued in sec .",
    "iii , to account for the @xmath85 and @xmath191 data simulataneously using the unitarity angle @xmath192 , the ratio of the penguin contribution to the tree contribution must be as large as 0.1 .",
    "it is easy to find @xmath193 must be adopted in order to explain the @xmath3 data @xcite . as a consequence of the penguin enhancement , the cp asymmetry is also large in the pqcd approach .",
    "we summarize the comparision among the fa , bbns , and pqcd approaches as follows :    1 .",
    "the scale independence of predictions in the fa and bbns approaches is achieved by the generalized fa method : a @xmath8-dependent evolution factor is extracted from hadronic matrix elements by considering the mixing of the effective operators at a scale below @xmath8 .",
    "this evolution factor is then combined with the @xmath8-dependent wilson coefficient to form a scale - independent effective wilson coefficient . however , the infrared - cutoff and gauge dependences appear . in the pqcd approach the scale independence",
    "is made explicit by extending the wilson evolution down to the hard scale @xmath43 directly , which is then followed by the second - stage rg evolution evaluated based on six - quark amplitudes . since external quarks are on - shell",
    ", the gauge invariance of pqcd predictions is guaranteed .",
    "the infrared - cutoff dependence , treated as a factorization scheme dependence , is removed by the universality of wave functons .",
    "2 .   factorizable contributions ( hadronic transition form factors ) are not claculable in the fa and bbns approaches , but calculable in the pqcd approach .",
    "the inclusion of parton transverse momenta smear the end - point singularity , and sudakov suppression guarantees that almost all contributions come from the region with @xmath194 .",
    "dynamical penguin enhancement exists in the pqcd approach , but not in the fa and bbns approaches .",
    "this enhancement , arising from different evolution effects in the form factors associated with the wilson coefficient @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 , is cruical for the simultaneous explanation of the @xmath85 and @xmath191 data using a smaller unitarity angle @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "nonfactorizable amplitudes are neglected in the fa approach , but calculable in the bbns and pqcd approaches . however , without sudakov suppression , higher - order corrections are not under control in the bbns approach .",
    "the end - point singularity needs to be smeared by taking into account parton transverse momenta and sudakov suppression . on the other hand ,",
    "nonfactorizable amplitudes are real in the bbns approach , but complex in the pqcd approach .",
    "the conclusion is the same : nonfactorizable contributions are destructive relative to the penguin contributions and negligible for the evaluation of branching ratios .",
    "annihilation contributions are neglected in the fa and bbns approaches , but calculable in the pqcd appraoch .",
    "the helicity suppression applies only to amplitudes associated with @xmath163 , but not to those associated with @xmath164 .",
    "it is found that the @xmath164 contribution is of the same order as the penguin contribution , and gives a large imaginary part .",
    "strong phases come from the bss mechanism and the extraction of the @xmath8 dependence from hadronic matrix elements in the fa and bbns approaches , but from annihilation diagrams in the pqcd approach .",
    "it has been argued that the two sources of strong phases in the fa and bbns approaches are in fact strongly suppressed by the charm mass threshold and by the end - point behavior of meson wave functions .",
    "7 .   because of the large penguin and annihilation contributions in the pqcd approach , the predicted cp asymmetry in the @xmath30 decays dominates over those in the fa and bbns approaches as shown in fig .",
    "5 . future measurements of cp asymmetries can distinguish the fa , bbns , and pqcd approaches .",
