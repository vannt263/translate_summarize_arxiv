    "we performed @xmath5y nmr on the `` pure ''  and substituted samples at different temperatures . in case of the annealed and non - annealed  pure   samples",
    ", we observed one asymmetric central peak ( inset : fig .",
    "3 ) shifted from @xmath97 in the fourier transformed spectrum , together with less intense peaks ( satellites ) on both sides of the central peak ( see fig .",
    "the shift in the @xmath5y nmr peak of the  pure  ybno arises from the coupling of y nuclei to ni@xmath17 spins of two different n.n.n",
    "since our measurements are on randomly aligned polycrystalline samples , asymmetric lineshape of the central peak ( mainline ) in the annealed sample corresponds to a powder pattern due to an asymmetric hyperfine coupling tensor @xmath98@xcite and anisotropic susceptibility.@xcite the vacuum annealing procedure leads to a large narrowing of the mainline and a decrease of the satellites intensities .",
    "the amount of defects corresponding to these satellites can be determined by measuring their area . using an asymmetric lorenzian fit ,",
    "the fractional area of one of these satellites decreases  from @xmath99% to @xmath100% after annealing .",
    "these satellites in  pure ",
    "ybno presumably originate from the in - chain defects , which will be discussed in details in sec .",
    "ivd .    in substituted compounds , the shift of the mainline for the substituted samples ,",
    "i.e. knight shift @xmath101 , remains unchanged from the  pure   sample at different temperatures ( fig .",
    "4 ) and compares well with the results published earlier.@xcite this implies that the haldane gap remains the same after impurity substitution .",
    "in contrast , the introduction of impurities ( zn / cu ) at the ni - site of the chain , results in a change in the local environment of the impurity .",
    "this change is evident by the appearance of satellites on both sides of the mainline .",
    "for example , in fig . 5 , we compare the nmr spectra of `` pure '' , @xmath102% , and @xmath23% zn substituted samples at @xmath79 k ( fig . 5 ( a ) ) and @xmath102% and @xmath20% cu substituted samples at @xmath64 k ( fig . 5 ( b ) ) .",
    "the intensity of the impurity - induced satellites increases with increasing impurity concentration keeping their shift from the mainline constant .",
    "this establishes that the satellite peaks are a direct consequence of substitutions and their positions are independent of their concentration , i.e. of the length of the chains .",
    "furthermore , fractional intensities of these cu and zn - induced satellites are significantly larger than the weak satellites observed in the annealed `` pure ''  sample .",
    "hence , they can safely be attributed to zn or cu neighbors .",
    "each of these satellites represents @xmath5y nuclei at a given distance from the impurity .  since one y nucleus is coupled to two different n.n.n .",
    "chains ( see fig . 1 ( b ) ) , for a concentration @xmath103 of the impurity , there should be @xmath104 y - nuclei contributing to each satellite . using an asymmetric lorenzian fit ( fig .",
    "6 ) , we extracted the fractional areas of one satellite peak to the whole spectrum ( outermost satellite on the right side of the mainline , marked by @xmath20 in fig .",
    "6 ) .  for a nominal concentration @xmath105% of zn or cu",
    ", our fit leads to an effective concentration of @xmath106%  for zn and @xmath107% for cu .",
    "this good agreement between the nominal stoichiometry and the actual in - chain number of defects shows that the substitution amount is well controlled here .",
    "comparison of cu and zn @xmath5y nmr spectra done in fig .",
    "7 shows that cu induces a staggered magnetization like zn .",
    "but the difference in the shifts of the nmr satellites shows that the amplitude of the induced magnetization near cu is smaller than that for zn .",
    "representative @xmath5y spectra are shown at different temperatures in figs . 8 ( a ) and 8 ( b ) for @xmath23% zn and @xmath102% cu substituted samples respectively .",
    "the ni@xmath17 ions closest to the impurity are the most affected by the substituent and give rise to the most shifted satellite indexed as the @xmath108 neighbor ( @xmath20 in figs . 8 ( a ) and 8 ( b ) ) .",
    "further neighbors are numbered in accordance with the decreasing shifts of satellites with respect to mainline .",
    "satellites with decreasing shifts alternate on each side of the mainline .",
    "this shows that the corresponding ni sites have a magnetization , which alternates in sign in addition to the non - perturbed magnetization represented here by the mainline shift .",
    "the appearance of such induced staggered magnetization near the defects is indeed expected by theoretical computations,@xcite as will be quantitatively detailed hereafter .    in the case of zn , the nearest y nuclei to the impurity ( marked by @xmath42 in fig",
    ". 1  ( b ) )  couple to both zn itself and one undisturbed chain .",
    "therefore , its corresponding nmr line should be shifted by half of that of the mainline with respect to @xmath97 ,  as zn is non - magnetic and hence does not contribute to @xmath109 .",
    "furthermore , this satellite should be half the intensity of the other satellites , from its specific position .",
    "in fact , this satellite has been observed clearly in fig . 8 ( a ) where it is labelled as `` @xmath42 '' : it is half as shifted as the mainline and half as intense as the other satellites . in the case of ybno : cu , such a peak is not observed as seen in fig . 8 ( b ) .",
    "this is not surprising as the @xmath1 cu - spin will now contribute to its shift , which should now become large , and would be severely affected by a large spin - lattice relaxation rate .",
    "therefore , the absence of such a peak is a clear local evidence that cu has indeed successfully substituted at a ni site .",
    "the shifts of the observed satellites were measured for different temperatures and concentrations .",
    "we note the shifts of the @xmath110 satellite as @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are frequencies corresponding to its center of gravity and that of the mainline respectively . due to the asymmetric powder pattern shapes , consideration of the centre of gravity for",
    "each peak yields a better description of the impurity - induced effects in the chain . in fig . 9 ( a ) , we present these shifts of the satellites ( @xmath114 ) at various temperatures for the spinless zn impurity . on the same figure ,",
    "we plot as well the data published earlier for the mg impurity , which is found identical to that of zn.@xcite  therefore , the induced magnetization by both zn and mg is quantitatively the same . in the present study ,",
    "the use of samples with smaller impurity content and less natural defects allowed us to largely improve the resolution and to detect more satellites in a wider temperature range . a similar plot is shown in fig .",
    "9 ( b ) for ybno : cu .",
    "these measurements allow us to get a direct measure of the amplitude and spatial shape of the magnetization induced by both non - magnetic and magnetic impurities , as will be discussed later .",
    "the bulk susceptibility @xmath84 in the pure  ybno contains the contribution from some unknown defects and extrinsic paramagnetic phases in addition to the intrinsic gap contribution . on the other hand , in @xmath5y nmr spectra ,",
    "defects and intrinsic behavior can be easily distinguished since defects broaden the mainline or induce satellites , whereas the intrinsic behavior is measured by the mainline shift .",
    "hence , the @xmath38dependence of the gap term  is best reflected by the temperature dependence of the nmr knight shift @xmath101 .",
    "indeed , the knight shift @xmath115 of the central line is expected to vary linearly with the uniform susceptibility @xmath116 through @xmath117    here , @xmath118  is the @xmath5y - ni hyperfine coupling constant and is independent of temperature , @xmath119  is the avogadro number , and @xmath120 is the chemical shift independent of temperature .",
    "the nmr shift @xmath101 results from two n.n.n .",
    "chains , while @xmath116 represents the intrinsic susceptibility of one @xmath2 chain , which explains the factor @xmath23 . as reported in fig .",
    "4 , the knight shift @xmath101 of the central peak decreases with decreasing @xmath38 and remains unchanged for all the samples at the corresponding@xmath121 .",
    "the observed exponential decrease in @xmath101 at low-@xmath38 is direct evidence of the presence of the haldane gap .",
    "our measurements on different samples at different temperatures match well with earlier results of shimizu _ et al .",
    "_ for pure  ybno@xcite ( as shown in fig .",
    "this indicates that the gap remains unchanged for impurity substituted samples .",
    "i.  affleck showed that the low temperature part of the susceptibility should follow @xmath122.@xcite previous studies used this model to fit the low-@xmath38 part of both nmr and macroscopic susceptibility measurements in order to extract the haldane gap and the superexchange coupling @xmath13 .",
    "this model also fits our data , as shown by a solid line in fig .",
    "4 for the cu@xmath102% compound , leading to @xmath123 ppm and @xmath124 k , which is in good agreement with the results published earlier.@xcite    however , we propose here a more rigorous way to determine @xmath13 .",
    "we used qmc simulations to directly fit our data in the full temperature range .",
    "we have calculated theoretically , by qmc simulations , the uniform susceptibility @xmath125  versus @xmath126 i.e. the susceptibility of the infinite @xmath2  chain theoretically , by qmc simulations .",

    "these curie terms lead to the corresponding spin value @xmath188 on each side of the impurity through @xmath189 .",
    "for zn , one finds an impurity - induced `` effective spin '' * *  * * @xmath190 on either side of the impurity in the chain , which is close to the vbs predicted @xmath191 . in case of ybno : cu , as @xmath192  is also found to follow a curie behavior , the impurity - induced susceptibility on either side of the impurity behaves almost as a free spin in the explored @xmath38-range",
    ". the lower value of @xmath193  than @xmath194  is well accounted for , hereagain , by qmc  simulations , if the cu - spin couples weakly and antiferromagnetically to the nearest - neighbor ni - spin .      as already stressed , the macroscopic susceptibility presented in fig .",
    "2 results from distinct contributions : the uniform contribution @xmath195which exhibits the haldane gap which  decreases exponentially with decreasing temperature ; the intrinsic defects such as zn or cu , and the other unknown defects and paramagnetic species , which are already present in the pure compound .",
    "the latter two contributions mainly give rise to a curie - like magnetization in the low - temperature region .",
    "we plotted these different contributions in the case of pure  ybno  in fig .",
    "note that the total susceptibility not only consists of the haldane term and a curie term , but also includes a residual non - curie term , which could be due to some defects that are not purely paramagnetic .",
    "this small residual non - curie term exists in all our samples , as evidenced in fig .",
    "17 and does not show any obvious connection with the substitution .",
    "it , therefore , limits any quantitative analysis of the substitution effect on macroscopic susceptibility .",
    "furthermore , the large contribution of the curie term present at low-@xmath38 even in the pure compound also severely limits any analysis , contrary to nmr experiments for which the zn and cu effects could be isolated .",
    "however , at low temperatures , the total susceptibility can be tentatively modelled by : @xmath196 here , @xmath197 is the constant term , which originates from van - vleck paramagnetism and core diamagnetism , @xmath198 is the curie constant .",
    "as discussed in the previous sections , the determination of the superexchange coupling @xmath199 k allows us to determine independently @xmath116 by using the qmc simulation results , which fit perfectly the mainline nmr data .",
    "_ _  _ _ in order to estimate the curie constant @xmath91 and @xmath200 reliably , we therefore fitted @xmath201 for the substituted as well as the pure samples to eq . 5 in the temperature range @xmath23 k @xmath43 @xmath38 @xmath43 @xmath202 k.",
    "we then fit our susceptibility data ( @xmath203 k ) for all the samples to extract the values of @xmath197 keeping the value of @xmath91 and @xmath200 obtained from the low - temperature fit . from the fit ( shown by solid line in fig .",
    "2 ( a ) ) , we found that @xmath197 remains almost unchanged for all the samples ( @xmath204 @xmath205 @xmath186 k / mole ) .",
    "a small @xmath200 @xmath21  @xmath20 k fits the data reliably for all the samples .",
    "comparison of nmr and squid  measurements in pure non - annealed and annealed sample allows us to get a better understanding of the various types of defects present in the pure  ybno .",
    "the annealing procedure leads to a reduction of the curie - term @xmath198 from @xmath206 @xmath186 k / mole to @xmath207 @xmath186 k / mole .",
    "such reduction shows that annealing cures part of the defects in the compound .",
    "the corresponding  @xmath5y nmr spectra of the non - annealed and annealed compounds are presented in fig .",
    "3 . in the non - annealed sample ,",
    "satellite peaks observed at frequencies smaller than the central peak , are of higher intensity than those noticed on the higher frequency side .",
    "after annealing , the intensity of the satellites reduced on both sides of the central peak and the intensity of the left side satellites almost equals to those in the right side of the mainline .",
    "hence , there are probably various kinds of defects : in - chain defects which give rise to satellites exactly like zn would do , and other defects which lead to the broad low - frequency feature",
    ".  there must be also magnetic entities at other non - chain sites , which do not affect the @xmath5y nmr signal , since squid  data show a large residual curie term in the annealed compound .",
    "the in - chain defects could be chain breaks , due to the polycrystalline nature of the sample , vacancies at ni - site and presence of ni@xmath90  in the chain .",
    "the other defects could be ni@xmath208  in the interstitial places .",
    "presumably , annealing in vacuum reduces the quantity of chain breaks ( some ni - ion  might migrate to the vacant sites on annealing at @xmath51c ) and ni@xmath90  in the sample , which is responsible for the reduction of satellite intensity . annealing results in a reduction from @xmath100% to @xmath86%/ni of in - chain defects .",
    "if one assumes that each of these in - chain defects is giving rise , as in the zn case , to two @xmath1  spins at low-@xmath38 , the reduction of @xmath209% percent of defects in the chain by annealing should lead to a decrease in the curie constant of @xmath210@xmath186k / mole ( @xmath211@xmath186k / mole ) .",
    "our observed reduction in curie constant was higher than this by @xmath212@xmath186k / mole .",
    "so the annealing not only reduces the chain defects but might also reduce the number of ni@xmath90  ( present in ybno ) or remove some of the excess oxygen present in the other extrinsic paramagnetic phases ( say , banio@xmath213 ) .",
    "some of these defects are however , still present in smaller concentration , even after annealing .      a plot of @xmath214 versus temperature done in the insets of fig .",
    "2 , demonstrates that low temperature susceptibility is dominated by a curie term , which increases in the substituted compounds . in fig .",
    "18 , we report the corresponding curie constant @xmath198 with increasing impurity content for cu and zn .",
    "this proves that the substitution induces a paramagnetic contribution , as already has been shown by nmr at higher temperatures .",
    "this contribution seems to persist at temperatures as low as @xmath215 k.  however , the pure  curie term appears similar in magnitude to the zn or cu contributions for concentrations of about @xmath102% .  a linear behavior of @xmath198 with increasing zn or cu concentration is expected .",
    "however , we found that the variation of @xmath198 with substituent concentration is non - linear and is steeper for higher concentrations .",
    "this limits any straightforward quantitative interpretation of the data .",
    "this limitation is mainly due to the fact that in substituted samples , a sizable part of @xmath198 originates from defects other than the substitution itself ( i.e. background curie term as discussed in sec .",
    "the precise variation of this background curie term with the substituent concentration is unknown .",
    "it appears that impurity substitution ( in small amounts ) at ni - site helps to decrease this background curie - term as @xmath198 for y@xmath3bani@xmath216cu@xmath217o@xmath4 is almost identical to that of the pure  whereas nmr showed that cu induces a paramagnetic contribution .",
    "a rough estimate of the impurity contribution can still be made using the increase of @xmath198 for high enough dopant content .",
    "a linear fit ( shown by solid lines in fig .",
    "18 ) without taking into  account the pure  composition leads to @xmath218@xmath186 k / mole/% zn and @xmath219@xmath186 * *  * * k / mole/% cu .    in the zn case , the nmr@xmath141measurements allowed us to extract @xmath220 @xmath186 k / mole/% zn .",
    "there is a good agreement between macroscopic and local measurements even though they apply in different temperature ranges ( @xmath221 k and @xmath222 k@xmath223 k respectively ) .",
    "this value is not that far from the vbs simplified picture where @xmath224  @xmath225@xmath186 k / mole@xcite originates from the two chain - end @xmath1 spins released by the introduction of zn .    in the cu case ,",
    "if the doped @xmath1 cu acts as a free spin , its susceptibility should add to that of the induced staggered magnetization measured by nmr , leading to @xmath226 .",
    "anyhow , we found @xmath227 to be smaller than @xmath228 @xmath186/mole/% cu .",
    "this indicates that the introduced @xmath1  does not act as a free spin , but magnetizes in the antiparallel orientation to the induced chain - end moments , at least at low-@xmath38 .",
    "this result is indeed expected if the cu interacts antiferromagnetically with the n.n .",
    "chain - end ni spins , in which case @xmath229  is expected for @xmath230  such conclusion confirms then the comparison done previously between qmc  simulations and our nmr results , which also leads to an antiferromagnetic coupling between ni and cu , with @xmath231 k.",
    "we have probed impurity induced magnetic effects in the haldane chain compound ybno via spinless ( zn ) and @xmath1  ( cu ) substitutions at the ni site .",
    "the haldane gap remains unchanged upon substitution .",
    "the intensity analysis of the nmr satellites proves that the amount of dopant impurity present in the sample agrees well with the nominally intended stoichiometry .",
    "@xmath5y nmr measurements show that zn or cu induce a staggered magnetization in their vicinity .",
    "its magnitude decays exponentially with a characteristic length equal to the correlation length @xmath232  of the infinite chain either for non magnetic or magnetic impurities .",
    "the fit of the nmr shift data on a large @xmath38 range for the pure system with the results of qmc  computations allows us to deduce a reliable value @xmath130 k.  for the zn impurity the spatial dependence and magnitude of the staggered susceptibility observed by nmr matches perfectly the qmc calculated values with @xmath233 k.  for @xmath69 k @xmath234 k ,  the total impurity induced curie susceptibility in the chain corresponds to an effective spin @xmath190  on either side of the impurity for the zn doped case , which is close to the theoretically predicted @xmath1  excitation at @xmath235    in this high-@xmath38 range , the induced staggered magnetization is slightly smaller for cu which can be explained if the @xmath1 cu spin is coupled antiferromagnetically with the near neighbor ni .",
    "a fit with the qmc  calculated spin polarization allows us to deduce the magnitude @xmath174  of this af coupling .",
    "this occurrence of an af coupling between the cu and the ni is confirmed by the fact that the macroscopic susceptibility induced by cu as measured by squid  is even smaller for cu impurities than for zn impurities for @xmath236 k.  this confirms that in this @xmath38-range the cu magnetization opposes that of the local moments of the chain - ends , as can be expected for an af  @xmath161 .",
    "further experiments are needed to follow the low-@xmath38  behavior of the local magnetization both for zn and cu .",
    "in the case of zn this would allow to check whether a curie law applies to the lowest temperatures , below @xmath237,@xmath141as suggested by macroscopic measurements , a matter still debated theoretically .",
    "as for the cu case this would allow us to better follow the modifications of local magnetization for @xmath238as strong deviations from that observed for spinless impurities are expected .  in case of high-@xmath239 cuprates ( e.g. yba@xmath3cu@xmath48o@xmath240 ) , substitution of cu by",
    "magnetic ( ni ) or nonmagnetic ( zn ) impurity,@xcite generates an induced polarization , with same temperature dependence of the staggered magnetization in both the cases , but with weaker effects for ni than zn .",
