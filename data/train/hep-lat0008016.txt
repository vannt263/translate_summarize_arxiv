    "ever since the advent of qcd , one has tried to isolate a subset of collective degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) which would be responsible for the non - perturbative features of the @xmath0 or @xmath3 yang - mills theory , in particular for confinement .",
    "it is natural to associate non - perturbative effects with topological excitations",
    ". therefore , all the non - trivial homotopy groups @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and their @xmath3 homologues have been considered .",
    "the corresponding topological excitations have codimension 4 , 3 and 2 respectively , and are instantons , abelian monopoles and center vortices . among these ,",
    "the latter have been emerging as particularly worthy of attention .",
    "center vortices correspond to non - contractible wilson loops in the adjoint representation .",
    "the simplest example is obtained with an @xmath0 gauge field along a wilson loop of length @xmath7 : @xmath8 .",
    "the wilson loop @xmath9 has trace @xmath10 in the adjoint representation , but is not contractible to the identity",
    ".    numerical lattice simulations have given evidence for the relevant role played by center vortices .",
    "now , topology is a feature of continuum field theory , and studying topological excitations on the lattice requires some kind of interpolation .",
    "non - contractible adjoint loops are rather elusive under direct investigation , so that an indirect approach has been successfully developed @xcite , in analogy with the detection of abelian monopoles .",
    "any topological excitation can be exposed as a local gauge - fixing singularity in an otherwise smooth gauge .",
    "abelian monopoles appear as singularities in the maximal abelian gauge , which minimizes the non - abelian components @xmath11 .",
    "similarly here , gauge - fixing is used to bring each gauge link as close as possible to a center element , hence the name maximal center gauge .",
    "this is equivalent to bringing all adjoint links close to the identity , that is , making the adjoint field as smooth as possible .",
    "each fundamental link matrix @xmath12 is then decomposed into a part @xmath13 , which reproduces the smooth adjoint field and in addition remains close to the @xmath3 identity , and a @xmath14 part .",
    "the latter seems at first sight irrelevant for the detection of non - contractible adjoint loops .",
    "however , such a loop as in the @xmath15 example above , will have a trace in the fundamental representation equal to @xmath16 , or more generally to a non - trivial @xmath2 element .",
    "if one neglects the fluctuations of the @xmath17 part , center vortices should appear as non - trivial @xmath2 excitations , localized on plaquettes and called @xmath18-vortices .",
    "@xmath18-vortices form closed co - dimension 2 surfaces in the dual space  time , which disorder the @xmath2 ensemble @xmath19 .",
    "they are localized defects , associated with macroscopic center vortices via gauge - fixing .",
    "this indirect strategy , called center projection , has been used to assess numerically the importance of center vortices .",
    "numerical evidence has been accumulating , which shows that this @xmath18-vortex disorder generates a @xmath2 string tension close in value to the original @xmath3 one @xcite .",
    "a physical density of vortices per @xmath20 can be extracted @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 chiral symmetry breaking induces a quark condensate and dirac zeromodes in the @xmath2 ensemble also @xcite . on the other hand , the coset @xmath21 ensemble shows no confinement , no chiral symmetry breaking , and no topological charge @xcite . while this may be a simple kinematic effect , it is tempting to adhere to the idea of center dominance , according to which center vortices , and nothing else , are responsible for the non - perturbative yang - mills features .",
    "one implication of center dominance is that the string tension produced by center vortices should match the yang - mills string tension exactly",
    ".    however , this construction rests on shaky ground .",
    "the connection between @xmath2 excitations which are located on a plaquette and their @xmath3 ancestors , center vortices believed to be of macroscopic size ",
    "smooth examples of which have been explicitly constructed @xcite  proceeds via gauge fixing . when each adjoint link is maximally close to the identity , the assignment of a @xmath2 center element to the fundamental link , i.e. the center projection itself ,",
    "can be performed with the most confidence .",
    "however , the technical difficulty of fixing a smooth gauge on the lattice is well known .",
    "gauge fixing proceeds by iterative local maximization of a gauge functional , and this procedure terminates when a local maximum is reached , without any guarantee , or in fact any reasonable hope , of reaching the global maximum . which local maximum is reached depends on the starting point along the gauge orbit .",
    "the various gauges reached correspond to `` lattice gribov copies '' .",
    "this technical problem , which plagues the landau and coulomb gauges on the lattice , is commonly believed to be rather harmless there .",
    "in maximal center gauge , its harmful effects have been exhibited : the copy obtained when starting the gauge - fixing procedure from landau gauge corresponds to a very high value of the gauge - fixing functional , higher than a typical local maximum , but gives , after center projection , @xmath2 excitations which do not confine .",
    "evidence has been produced that , the higher the value of the local maximum one reaches , the smaller the @xmath2 string tension @xcite .",
    "although this evidence is currently under dispute @xcite , the technical problem of lattice gribov copies prevents a reasonable degree of confidence in the idea of center dominance .    the present paper ,",
    "we believe , should restore full confidence in this idea . here , we address and solve the problem of the gauge ambiguity .",
    "this problem was already solved for the landau gauge in ref.@xcite .",
    "there , a different gauge was proposed , the laplacian gauge , which is lorentz - symmetric and produces a smooth gauge field like the landau gauge , but has no lattice gribov copies .",
    "the advantages of such an unambiguous gauge have barely been explored @xcite . in the present paper , we generalize the construction of @xcite to @xmath3 in the adjoint representation , since we want the adjoint field to be smooth . in our `` laplacian center gauge '' , the adjoint @xmath22 field is uniquely gauge - fixed  aside from exceptional configurations which are genuine gribov copies , and a remaining local @xmath2 gauge freedom subsists .",
    "now , even though the adjoint field is uniquely gauge - fixed in general , there exists a sub - manifold of points where the gauge remains ill - defined .",
    "these local gauge ambiguities are the necessary companions of macroscopic topological excitations .",
    "as explained earlier , a non - contractible adjoint wilson loop will prevent the adjoint field from being smooth everywhere ; similarly , an abelian monopole will correspond to a singularity of the abelian projected field .",
    "indeed , by studying the details of the gauge condition , we show that on some subset of points the gauge freedom is locally enlarged from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , and from @xmath24 to @xmath0 , defining two types of local ambiguities which can be readily identified with center vortices and abelian monopoles , the latter being embedded in the former , as anticipated in @xcite .",
    "these topological objects appear naturally together as local gauge defects .",
    "this unified description reconciles with center dominance the large body of numerical evidence in favor of monopole dominance : abelian monopoles do not represent an alternative to center vortices as effective degrees of freedom ; they are their undissociable partners .",
    "in particular , the condensation of monopoles in the confined phase of the @xmath3 theory @xcite implies the percolation of center vortex surfaces , by the following simple argument .",
    "a non - zero monopole condensate means that a single monopole can be created at point @xmath25 , or equivalently that monopoles are not pair - wise confined . since monopole world ",
    "lines are closed loops , the monopole at @xmath25 must have a partner at @xmath26 , and a `` single '' monopole simply has a partner at infinity .",
    "this in turn means that monopole world ",
    "lines percolate . since we show that monopole world ",
    "lines are embedded in center vortex surfaces , percolation of one implies percolation of the other .",
    "we complement the qualitative study of local gauge defects outlined above with a quantitative study , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we show that , in laplacian center gauge , the center - projected ensemble confines , while the coset ensemble does not .",
    "this confirms earlier @xmath0 results @xcite , and firms up the sketchy @xmath1 evidence @xcite , all obtained in the ambiguous maximal center gauge . but",
    "the scenario of center dominance demands _ exact _ equality of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 string tensions .",
    "we test this scenario by considering different laplacian center gauges , obtained from different lattice discretizations of the laplacian . at finite lattice spacing @xmath27 ,",
    "different gauges give widely different @xmath2 string tensions , which at first sight looks like a terrible blow to center dominance .",
    "nevertheless , we show that , in all three gauges we consider and presumably in any unambiguous gauge , equality of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 string tensions is approached as @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , our results support the restoration of center dominance in the continuum limit , and only then .",
    "section ii of our paper gives an explicit construction of the laplacian center gauge for @xmath3 .",
    "section iii discusses the local gauge ambiguities and their identification as monopoles and center vortices .",
    "section iv presents our numerical results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "section v shows the effect of alternative gauges and discusses center dominance . a final summary and discussion",
    "is presented in section vi .",
    "the laplacian gauge was originally proposed by vink and wiese @xcite , who suggested to use the eigenvectors of the covariant laplacian operator to fix the gauge in a non  abelian gauge theory : the eigenvectors transform covariantly , and one can fix the gauge by prescribing their color orientation at each space - time point .",
    "this method takes advantage of a non  local procedure to fix a covariant smooth gauge in an unambiguous way .",
    "there are exceptional cases , genuine gribov copies , in which the gauge fixed configuration is not unique : however such cases can be easily detected by the presence of degenerate eigenvalues and  from the viewpoint of numerical simulations ",
    "never occur .",
    "the perturbative formulation of the laplacian gauge in @xmath0 has been studied in @xcite , while the problem of its renormalizability is still open . since we are interested in reducing the symmetry of the gauge group from @xmath3 to its center @xmath2 , it is useful to consider the laplacian operator in the adjoint representation .",
    "in fact , since the adjoint representation is invariant under gauge transformations in @xmath2 , the adjoint laplacian procedure fixes unambiguously the gauge up to the center symmetry , and the laplacian center gauge is just another name for the adjoint laplacian gauge . the first step towards this construction",
    "was already considered , in @xmath0 , by a. van der sijs @xcite .",
    "consider 4dimensional lattice @xmath3 gauge theory .",
    "the adjoint laplacian operator @xmath29 is given by [ adjlap ] -^ab_xy ( ) = _ 2_x , y^ab - _ ^ab ( x ) _ y , x+ - _ ^ba ( x- ) _ y , x - where @xmath27,@xmath30 are color indices and @xmath31,@xmath32 are space  time lattice coordinates .",
    "the dotted @xmath33 are the link variables in the adjoint representation and are related to the links @xmath34 in the fundamental by [ adjlink ] _",
    "^ab ( x ) = _ a u _ ( x ) _ b u_^ ( x ) @xmath35 , @xmath36 being the generators of @xmath3 with the normalization @xmath37 . if @xmath38 is the volume of the lattice , @xmath39 is a @xmath40\\times [ ( n^2 - 1)v]$ ] real symmetric matrix which depends on the gauge field . the eigenvalues @xmath41 of @xmath42 are real and the eigenvector equation is [ eigeq ] ^ab_xy ( ) ^(j ) _ b ( y ) = _ j ^(j ) _ a ( x ) where @xmath43 , @xmath44 $ ] are the @xmath40$]dimensional ( real ) eigenvectors .",
    "so we can associate @xmath45dimensional real vectors @xmath46 to every lattice site .",
    "+ let us consider a gauge transformation @xmath47 on the fundamental links . then , making use of the property @xmath48 , the eigenvector equation ( [ eigeq ] ) becomes ^^ai ( x ) ^ik_xy (  ) ^kb ( y ) ^(j ) _ b ( y ) = _ j ^(j ) _ a ( x ) this relation shows that the eigenvalues are gauge invariant and the eigenvectors transform according to @xmath49 .",
    "this transformation law can be rewritten as follows [ trlaw ] ( x ) ^(j ) ( x ) ^ ( x ) = ^(j )  ( x ) where we have defined the @xmath50 matrices ( i.e. in the @xmath3 algebra ) @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "gauge transformations rotate the vectors @xmath46 in color space and so we can fix the gauge by requiring a conventional arbitrary orientation for the @xmath46 . this orientation may depend on the lattice site and it is fixed once and for all ; the simplest choice is to make it space  time independent .",
    "we will see below that to perform the reduction of the gauge symmetry from @xmath3 to @xmath2 we only need to fix the orientation of two eigenvectors of the laplacian operator .",
    "since we are interested in fixing a smooth gauge , we consider the two lowest eigenmodes @xmath53 and @xmath54 , associated with the smallest eigenvalues of the laplacian .",
    "the gauge fixing procedure can be split in two steps . in the first",
    ", one rotates @xmath55 at every @xmath31 so that @xmath56 is diagonal , i.e. in the cartan subalgebra of @xmath50 .",
    "this leaves a residual symmetry corresponding to gauge transformations belonging to the cartan subgroup @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , at that stage we already have obtained an unambiguous abelian gauge , called laplacian abelian gauge in @xcite .",
    "nothing more can be done with only one eigenvector . to further reduce the gauge freedom",
    "we must consider a second step where the second eigenvector @xmath54 is taken into account .",
    "the gauge transformation that has rotated @xmath55 to the cartan subalgebra , maps @xmath58 to @xmath59 . while @xmath56 is invariant under gauge transformations in @xmath57 , this is in general not the case for @xmath59 ( special cases are discussed later ) .",
    "the gauge symmetry can now be reduced to @xmath2 by considering gauge transformations in @xmath57 which make some conventionally chosen color components of the twice rotated matrix @xmath60 vanish .",
    "the remnant center gauge freedom , consistently with the construction , can not be fixed within the described procedure in the adjoint representation .",
    "in fact , as follows from equation ( [ trlaw ] ) , the matrices @xmath61 are invariant under gauge transformations in the center group @xmath2 ( these gauge transformations are the identity in the adjoint representation ) .",
    "now we describe explicitly how to perform the presented two  step program .",
    "* step 1 * + the starting point is equation ( [ trlaw ] ) for the first eigenvector @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath55 is an @xmath63 ( traceless ) hermitian matrix , and so there exist @xmath63 unitary matrices @xmath64 which diagonalize it ( we recall that the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of @xmath55 ) . diagonalizing @xmath55 is equivalent to requiring that @xmath56 be in the cartan subalgebra of @xmath50 .",
    "since we want @xmath64 to be a gauge transformation in @xmath3 , we must require that @xmath65 .",
    "the condition that @xmath56 is diagonal does not specify @xmath64  i.e. the gauge symmetry  up to @xmath57 transformations yet .",
    "in fact there are non - diagonal @xmath3 gauge transformations which , when applied to @xmath56 , have the only effect of exchanging the position of the eigenvalues along the diagonal . in order to eliminate this permutation arbitrariness ,",
    "it is necessary to impose an ordering of the eigenvalues .",
    "this is simple to do since the eigenvalues of a hermitian matrix are real .",
    "once some conventional ordering has been chosen , @xmath64 is really defined up to @xmath57 transformations .",
    "a last remark concerns the explicit evaluation of @xmath66 , which , in view of ( [ trlaw ] ) , is the problem of diagonalizing a hermitian matrix . for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 gauge groups , this evaluation can be performed analytically . for larger groups @xmath67",
    ", one can simply make use of numerical methods .",
    "* step 2 * + in * step 1 * we have found @xmath64 defined up to gauge transformations @xmath68 . a second step is necessary to reduce the symmetry from @xmath57 to @xmath2 ; this means that we must introduce a criterion which specifies @xmath69 up to @xmath2 .",
    "consider the second eigenvector @xmath70 and apply the gauge transformation @xmath64 to @xmath58 so as to obtain @xmath71 .",
    "now we look for @xmath69 such that the vector @xmath72 , obtained from @xmath73 , has a conventional orientation in color space .",
    "also in this case there is no need that this orientation be the same at all @xmath31 but , however , this is the simplest choice . in order to make the discussion more transparent",

    "the condition 3 ) in ( [ step2req ] ) is introduced to eliminate the sign ambiguities @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in conclusion , after this second step , we have obtained the transformation @xmath84 which fixes uniquely the gauge up to the center symmetry @xmath78 . in the @xmath3 case ,",
    "the symmetry must be reduced from @xmath57 to @xmath2 by fixing @xmath85 phases .",
    "this can be accomplished , in a simple and elegant way , by requiring that the @xmath85 sub  diagonal elements of @xmath60 be real positive . moreover , with this choice of constraints , the conditions defining the monopoles turn out to be particularly simple .",
    "two last important remarks concern the accidental degeneracy of @xmath86 or @xmath87 in ( [ eigeq ] ) and the sign arbitrariness in the eigenvectors @xmath43 . in the described procedure",
    "we have assumed that the two lowest eigenvalues @xmath86 and @xmath87 of the laplacian operator @xmath42 are both non - degenerate .",
    "if either one is degenerate , the gauge fixing can not be carried out in an unambiguous way ; however these cases are really exceptional and in the numerical simulations never occur .",
    "moreover this degeneracy is easy to check and so these events can be detected .",
    "the second point is about the arbitrariness in the eigenvectors @xmath43 , since they are defined up to a global scale factor and a global sign .",
    "the two  step method to fix the gauge makes use of the orientation of the vectors @xmath88 and @xmath89 in color space .",
    "so , while the rescaling can not give rise to any ambiguity in the procedure , the freedom in the choice of the global sign can . this freedom can be eliminated with a conventional choice on @xmath43 .",
    "local defects may occur in the laplacian center gauge fixing procedure . in this section",
    "we discuss how they show up and how they can be associated with monopoles and center vortices .",
    "this association is consistent with the initial proposal by t hooft of identifying gauge fixing defects and topological features of the gauge fixed theory .",
    "moreover , in this approach , we will make apparent the close relation which exists between monopoles and center vortices in the laplacian center gauge .",
    "let us start by showing the conditions that give rise to defects at each step of the gauge fixing procedure .",
    "* step 2 ill  defined * + in * step 2 * we fix the @xmath57 symmetry by looking for gauge transformations @xmath69 in the cartan subgroup that make some color components of @xmath72 vanish .",
    "this is equivalent to requiring that particular entries in the complex matrix @xmath60 be real positive .",
    "if it happens that , at some point @xmath31 , any of these entries is zero , the second step can not be carried out completely .",
    "let us illustrate the argument by considering @xmath1 .",
    "the conditions ( [ step2req ] ) specify @xmath69 via the phases @xmath76 and @xmath79 given by ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) . if , at some point @xmath31 , one of the following cases takes place [ step2ill ]    l _ 1 ( x ) -i _ 2 ( x ) = 0 + _ 6 ( x ) -i _ 7 ( x ) = 0    the corresponding phase ",
    "@xmath90 for 1 ) and @xmath91 for 2 )  is not defined .",

    "the conditions 1 ) or 2 ) , and more generally the corresponding ones for @xmath3 , set two constraints , and so the points @xmath31 where the remaining gauge freedom is enlarged from @xmath2 to include a continuous @xmath24 group form 2dimensional surfaces in the 4dimensional space  time . for @xmath0 , these surfaces are defined by the collinearity of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "* step 1 ill  defined * + in * step 1 * we reduce the gauge symmetry from @xmath3 to @xmath57 by diagonalizing @xmath55 with a conventional ordering for the eigenvalues along the diagonal . if , at some point @xmath31 , two eigenvalues happen to be equal , the conventional ordering is no longer unique and the procedure becomes ill - defined at that point .",
    "for instance , let us consider @xmath1 .",

    "the symmetry is @xmath102 .",

    "imagine that the matrix @xmath64 which diagonalizes @xmath55 is computed in two stages .",
    "in the first stage , we partially diagonalize @xmath55 so as to leave only two ( symmetric ) off  diagonal elements different from zero . in the second stage ,",
    "an @xmath0 transformation is considered which makes these last two off ",
    "diagonal elements vanish .",
    "this second stage is equivalent to the diagonalization of an @xmath103 matrix @xmath104 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can always suppose that the @xmath105 diagonal elements found after the first stage and not touched by the @xmath0 transformation of the second stage , are all different , and that the equality of two eigenvalues of @xmath55 can show up only in the second stage ( this means that , in general , the position of the non - zero off  diagonal elements in the partially diagonalized matrix depends on @xmath31 and on the conventional ordering ) .",
    "then the equality of two eigenvalues takes place at the points @xmath31 where @xmath106 : since three constraints must be satisfied , the points @xmath31 form 1dimensional strings in 4dimensional space  time .",

    "i.e. one of the @xmath24 subgroups is promoted to @xmath0  , the argument given here for @xmath0 can be extended to a generic @xmath3 .",
    "fig.1 sketches the embedding of monopole world  lines in center vortex surfaces just discussed .",
    "[ sketch ]    this close connection between monopoles and center vortices has actually been observed on the lattice @xcite , and even presented as a puzzle @xcite : on a cooled @xmath0 lattice configuration , almost all abelian monopoles , identified as a @xmath126 cube through which one measures a @xmath127 magnetic flux , are attached to two opposite center vortex plaquettes .",
    "this is precisely the situation we describe : as correctly anticipated in @xcite , abelian monopoles and anti - monopoles are like alternating beads on a necklace formed by the center vortex string .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations to investigate the role of the center degrees of freedom in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lattice gauge theories . according to the discussion of the two previous sections ,",
    "we have made use of the laplacian center gauge fixing to reduce the symmetry to the center subgroup . in this approach ",
    "considering for instance @xmath1  we have described how center vortices can be detected by looking for the points @xmath31 where , for example , @xmath128 or , equivalently , @xmath89 describes a @xmath129 rotation in color space around the @xmath130 axis , moving along a closed contour encircling @xmath31 .",
    "the method is the same for a generic group @xmath3 . as a by - product , monopole world ",
    "lines are identified by the points @xmath31 where two eigenvalues of @xmath56 are equal ; but our aim here is to study the center degrees of freedom and not the abelian ones .",
    "numerical simulations are performed on a lattice and so the eigenvectors of the adjoint laplacian operator can be computed only at discrete points .",
    "this implies that an interpolation procedure must be defined to detect center vortices and , if desired , monopoles .",
    "we have tried several interpolation methods in order to investigate the robustness of the results with respect to different choices .",
    "unfortunately , the arbitrariness introduced by this necessary step seems large at the lattice spacings we considered .",
    "we have found only one plaquette - based interpolation scheme which guarantees that center vortex surfaces are closed .",
    "it is identical to the construction of @xcite , eq.(10 ) .",
    "remarkably , this interpolation scheme gives center vortices at locations which _ coincide _ with the @xmath18-vortices obtained after center projection by greensite and collaborators @xcite .",
    "following this prescription , every gauge fixed link @xmath131 is decomposed as the product of two parts [ decomp ] u_(x ) = z_(x ) u_ ( x ) where @xmath132 is the center projected link living in @xmath2 and @xmath133 is the coset link taking values in @xmath22 .",
    "for instance , this splitting can be carried out by requiring that @xmath134 .",
    "thus , starting from an @xmath3 gauge fixed configuration , one builds up two projected configurations , made of the @xmath132 and the @xmath133 links .",
    "then , if @xmath135 is a wilson loop along the closed contour @xmath113 , making use of the decomposition ( [ decomp ] ) , one can write [ wc ] w(c)=(c ) w ( c ) = _ p ( p ) w ( c ) [ wldecomp ] where @xmath136 is the plaquette built from center links @xmath137 , and @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the wilson loops evaluated with the coset links @xmath140 and with the center links @xmath141 respectively .",
    "@xmath142 is the product over all the plaquettes @xmath143 belonging to a surface @xmath115 supported on @xmath113 ; the value of @xmath144 does not depend on the choice of @xmath115 and , for simplicity , we can suppose that it is the planar surface bounded by @xmath113 .",
    "since we have fixed a gauge where @xmath145 is smooth , we expect that , to a reasonable approximation , @xmath135 has a non - trivial value with respect to @xmath2 if and only if @xmath144 does . in this approach ,",
    "a non - trivial value for @xmath136 is the `` signal '' for a center vortex .",
    "we stress again that the vortices identified in this way _ coincide _ with interpolated gauge defects , which brings center projection on firmer theoretical ground .",
    "we have collected 1000 @xmath0 configurations at three different values of the coupling constant @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 on a @xmath149 lattice ; for @xmath1 we have generated 500 configurations on a @xmath149 lattice at @xmath150 .",
    "the following figure shows our measurement of the creutz ratios @xmath151 for @xmath0 at @xmath152 ( @xmath153 is the wilson loop @xmath154 ) .",
    "empty circles refer to @xmath0 , full circles to center projection after laplacian center gauge fixing , and triangles to the coset part .",
    "the continuous strip is the value in the literature @xcite of the @xmath0 string tension for the chosen set of parameters .",
    "these numerical results show , on one hand , the flattening of the creutz ratios in the @xmath23 sector and , on the other hand , the vanishing of the creutz ratios computed with the coset links . we have obtained similar behaviour for the other two values of @xmath155 : @xmath156 and @xmath148 .",
    "we have also carried out the same study for the @xmath1 lattice gauge theory .",
    "the next figure shows our results for the creutz ratios in the @xmath78 sector after laplacian center gauge fixing of 500 configurations .",
    "the continuous strip is the value in the literature@xcite of the @xmath1 string tension at the considered set of parameters .",
    "also in this case , one clearly sees a nice flattening to a non - vanishing value of the creutz ratios evaluated with the center projected links .    therefore , our @xmath0 and @xmath1 results are qualitatively similar to those previously obtained in direct maximal center gauge in @xmath0 .",
    "they confirm the finding that the center - projected ensemble of gauge defects confines , with a string tension close to that of the original non - abelian theory , whereas the coset ensemble does not .",
    "one difference however is apparent : the creutz ratios tend to an asymptotic value much more slowly in laplacian gauge than in dmc gauge .",
    "this is caused by the presence of many more close pairs of center vortices .",
    "indeed , the vortex density is much higher , by a factor 3 to 5 , than that measured in dmc gauge .",
    "a similar increase in the density of abelian monopoles was observed previously in the laplacian abelian gauge @xcite .",
    "one may consider this a practical nuisance , since these additional vortex pairs make the extraction of the projected string tension more noisy .",
    "one may instead consider that the center - projected ensemble represents the original one more closely , since it partially reproduces the short - distance increase of the force .",
    "finally , one can compare dmc and laplacian center gauges from the point of view of the computer effort . because two eigenvectors of the adjoint laplacian must be computed",
    ", one may get the impression that the laplacian gauge is computationally expensive .",
    "that impression is misleading . using the public - domain package arpack @xcite to solve the eigenvalue problem ,",
    "the computer time needed to gauge fix one @xmath149 configuration is about the same as for 50 monte carlo sweeps in the case of @xmath0 , and 300 to 500 for @xmath1 .",
    "this is far less than required to fix to dmc gauge iteratively .",
    "the figures presented in the previous section show good agreement between the creutz ratios evaluated from the center projected ensemble of gauge defects and the value of the string tension in the literature for @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the same @xmath157 . however , the importance of this numerical agreement should not be overestimated .",
    "numerical simulations are performed at a finite value of the lattice spacing , and we see no reason to believe that , if lattice artifacts are negligible for the @xmath3 gauge theory , their effect is equally small on the results obtained from the center projected model .",
    "nevertheless , our conjecture is that , even if the value of the string tension in the center sector is appreciably modified by lattice artifacts at finite lattice spacing , this dependence has to vanish in the continuum limit .",
    "the observation of such a behaviour would be a robust confirmation of the relevance of the center degrees of freedom in the confinement mechanism . in order to investigate this issue ,",
    "we have considered three different lattice laplacian operators to fix the gauge .",
    "they differ by terms which vanish in the continuum limit , i.e. higher derivatives or irrelevant operators . in practice",
    ", these new laplacians have been obtained very simply , by smearing the links @xmath158 and substituting smeared links in the construction of the laplacian ( [ adjlap ] ) .",
    "specifically , we have considered @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 smearing steps ( staple weight = @xmath162 ) on the @xmath158 links .",
    "we stress that the smeared links are used only to obtain different gauge fixing operators ; the gauge transformations are always applied to the non - smeared link configurations , as well as the center projection and measurements .",
    "the same sample of configurations has been fixed in each one of the three gauges , and the string tension has been measured in the center sector after center projection each time . in order to estimate more accurately the string tension from the @xmath163 links , we have constructed smeared wilson loops , where the spatial sides are made of links recursively smeared with a fixed time coordinate .",
    "this procedure is identical to that commonly used in the measurement of the @xmath3 static potential .",
    "it reduces the contribution of excited states , thus improving the statistical accuracy on the string tension .",
    "although in the center projected theory , the existence of a transfer matrix is doubtful , we verified that spatial smearing did not introduce a measurable bias . from the wilson loop data , we have extracted the @xmath2 string tension using the same fitting procedure as employed for the @xmath3 case , with an ansatz of the form @xmath164 for the static potential @xmath165 and the @xmath3 string tensions largely cancel out when considering their ratio . ]    to illustrate our results , we show in the following figures the @xmath23 and @xmath78 creutz ratios measured in the three gauges .",
    "the gauge dependence of the projected string tension is dramatic .    the string tensions @xmath166",
    "( @xmath167 is the number of smearing steps performed on the links @xmath158 entering in the laplacian operator eq.([adjlap ] ) ) obtained from our 1000 @xmath0 configurations at @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 in the three different laplacian center gauges are then compared with the @xmath0 string tension @xmath168 reported in the literature .",
    "we denote by @xmath169 the ratio @xmath170 .",
    "the following table summarizes our results :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the trend is similar to @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the ratios @xmath169 are very close to those measured in @xmath0 at @xmath171 . following the argument presented above",
    ", this indicates that the typical vortex size , in lattice units , is the same in both cases . with @xmath172 fm and @xmath173 fm ,",
    "we obtain that the ratios of @xmath1 over @xmath0 center vortex sizes is about @xmath174 .",
    "such a slight increase is consistent with the expected increase of the adjoint string - breaking distance @xcite , which is connected to the center vortex size @xcite .",
    "the standard iterative local maximization methods used to fix the gauge on the lattice are ambiguous : they stop when _ any _ local maximum has been reached .",
    "because of this ambiguity , one tends to mistrust measurements performed in such ill - defined gauges , as well as the physical models based on these measurements .",
    "this applies in particular to the scenario of vortex dominance , according to which the string tension of the non - abelian theory can be exactly reproduced by considering only its center degrees of freedom , identified after gauge - fixing .",
    "evidence for this scenario comes exclusively from lattice studies using ambiguous gauges .",
    "some amount of counter - evidence has also been reported , again in similar ambiguous gauges .",
    "motivated by our skepticism , we have constructed , by generalizing the approach of @xcite , a gauge which smooths the adjoint @xmath22 field like the usual maximal center gauge ( mcg ) , but has no ambiguity .",
    "after gauge fixing to this laplacian center gauge , a remaining local @xmath2 gauge freedom subsists . the local gauge defects which appear in this gauge are of two types : co - dimension 2 , where the remaining gauge freedom is enlarged from @xmath2 to @xmath24 , i.e. to accommodate a @xmath24 subgroup ; and co - dimension 3 , where it is further enlarged to accommodate an @xmath0 subgroup .",
    "these two types of defects can be identified with center vortices and abelian monopoles respectively , with the latter embedded in the former .",
    "thus we provide a natural , unified description of these two objects which had been considered as alternative choices of effective degrees of freedom .",
    "we have numerically implemented the laplacian center gauge for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to being free of the ambiguities which plague the maximal center gauge , our gauge is also computationally cheaper .",
    "the gauge defects obtained by local interpolation of the laplacian eigenvectors coincide with the @xmath18-vortices obtained by center projection .",
    "a measurement of creutz ratios in the center - projected @xmath23 and @xmath78 ensembles superficially confirms earlier observations made in mcg , albeit with a higher density of center vortices : the center - projected ensemble confines like the original one , while the coset @xmath22 ensemble does not . upon closer scrutiny however , the center - projected string tension is smaller than the original one .",
    "the difference between the two can be varied by arbitrary amounts , by adding higher derivative terms to the laplacian used for the gauge fixing .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown evidence that this difference decreases as the continuum limit of the lattice theory is approached .",
    "the gauge dependence of the center - projected string tension , clearly visible at finite lattice spacing @xmath27 , appears to go away as @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , while our study calls attention to lattice artifacts in the center projection , it gives support to the center dominance scenario .    since the center degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) reproduce the non - abelian confinement , one may wonder if the center - projected model can also reproduce other non - perturbative features of the non - abelian one , like chiral symmetry breaking or topological susceptibility .",
    "indeed , one would expect this to be the case , since the coset @xmath22 ensemble appears deprived of all these non - perturbative features @xcite .",
    "however , one encounters two difficulties when trying to measure the appropriate observables in the @xmath2 model : lattice artifacts and non - positivity of the transfer matrix .",
    "we have already emphasized how lattice artifacts , in the choice of the discretized laplacian or in the interpolation / center projection step , can affect the matching of the @xmath2 string tension with the @xmath3 one .",
    "lattice artifacts modify the center vortex density so strongly that we can not really quote a value for this important quantity .",
    "they also strongly influence the measurement of the chiral condensate in the @xmath2 ensemble@xcite .",
    "naturally , they also make it conceptually difficult to define a topological charge on the lattice , especially for a discrete @xmath2 theory .",
    "another , fundamental , difficulty comes from the non - locality of the gauge condition .",
    "after gauge fixing , all gauge links are correlated with each other , and this correlation persists after center projection .",
    "furthermore , it may not die out exponentially at large distances in the center - projected ensemble , making it impossible to define a local effective hamiltonian and a positive transfer matrix .",
    "indeed , we have observed symptoms of this disease when attempting to measure glueball masses in the @xmath2 ensemble : in several cases , correlations at large distances would become significantly negative , and impossible to interpret as the euclidean - time propagator of a superposition of eigenstates of a hamiltonian .",
    "difficulties have also been reported for the abelian projection @xcite .",
    "symptoms may even be present for the string tension , since in ref.@xcite , creutz ratios measured after abelian projection in the maximal abelian gauge appear to _ increase _ with distance ; a proper , normal decrease was restored when using instead the laplacian abelian gauge .",
    "we also observed a similar increasing behaviour for the @xmath2 creutz ratios when we applied direct maximal center gauge to our @xmath0 configurations @xcite .",
    "one may wonder if the center d.o.f .",
    "are responsible for some non - perturbative features of the yang - mills theory , like the string tension , and not for others , like the glueball mass . or one may speculate that a local effective hamiltonian can indeed be defined after center projection , but that an imperfect identification of the center d.o.f . spoils this construction : this would be one way to explain why a proper , decreasing behaviour of the creutz ratios is restored in the laplacian gauge .",
    "one bold attitude towards this problem is to make an ansatz for this effective hamiltonian and test its consequences @xcite .",
    "much work remains to be done in studying the role and the interaction of the center d.o.f .",
    "here we have tried to put on firmer numerical ground the first step in this ambitious program , namely that @xmath2 center degrees of freedom are responsible for the full string tension of the @xmath3 theory . in this process , we have clarified the meaning of center vortices and abelian monopoles as local gauge defects : each monopole is pierced by a center - vortex string .",
    "monopoles and anti - monopoles alternate along the center - vortex string like beads on a necklace .",
    "furthermore , the eigenvectors of the covariant adjoint laplacian , whose color orientations are used to fix the gauge , are analogous to the adjoint higgs field in the georgi - glashow model .",
    "and our abelian monopoles , which we identify via zeros of the higgs field , are analogous to the t hooft - polyakov monopoles .",
    "center vortices appear when a second adjoint higgs field is considered .",
    "let us speculate further on a possible scenario for the complementary role of monopoles and center vortices .",
    "we consider 3 distance regimes for the force between static charges : @xmath175 at large distances @xmath176 , center vortices are the relevant degrees of freedom ; they govern the behaviour of the wilson loop in all group representations , and in particular give the correct fundamental string tension and the correct , vanishing adjoint string tension .",
    "@xmath177 at intermediate distances @xmath178 , center d.o.f . are insufficient to describe the non - abelian theory , and the abelian monopoles must be considered ; this generates a linearly rising potential in the adjoint and higher representations , with abelian casimir ratios ( 2 instead of 8/3 for adjoint @xmath0 ) .",
    "@xmath179 at short distances @xmath180 , the full non - abelian nature of the color field must be considered , to ensure recovery of the one - gluon exchange perturbative potential .",
    "in other words , the original non - abelian d.o.f . can be progressively decimated , down to abelian then center ones , as one considers larger distances .    in this scenario , the distances @xmath181 and @xmath182 separating the three regimes are related to the typical sizes of a monopole and a center vortex respectively : @xmath175 an abelian description of the monopole field is sufficient when one stays outside its core ; and @xmath177 at large distances , the monopole field can be further approximated by that of the center vortex which pierces it .",
    "statement @xmath175 is well - known : the regular @xmath0 gauge field of a t hooft - polyakov monopole can be gauge - transformed to a `` stringy '' gauge , where the gauge field is singular along a dirac string ( e.g. @xmath183 ) , and where the flux of the dirac string is cancelled by the higgs field . in that gauge ,",
    "the gauge field is abelian outside the core of the monopole . to justify statement @xmath177",
    ", one can choose a gauge where the gauge field is singular along a whole line ( @xmath184 ) rather than a half - line ( @xmath183 ) @xcite .",
    "in that gauge also , the gauge field is abelian outside the monopole core .",
    "moreover , at large @xmath185 it is the same as that given by a center vortex piercing the monopole along @xmath184 .",
    "however , while the existence of a scale @xmath181 below which an abelian description breaks down seems inevitable , that of a separate scale @xmath186 where center d.o.f . `` kick in '' is less so",
    ". one may say that center vortices screen the monopoles .",
    "we also find support for this scenario in theoretical studies of the georgi - glashow model @xcite , which argue that the t hooft - polyakov monopoles present in this model become irrelevant at large distances , and that confinement is produced by center vortices instead .",
    "ref.@xcite in particular builds explicitly a classical solution which looks like a t hooft - polyakov monopole at short distances , and a pair of center vortices at large distances .    since the completion of this paper ,",
    "further work @xcite extending the study of @xcite has appeared .",
    "the results of refs.@xcite can be summarized as follows : in the iterative maximal center gauge , a larger value of the gauge - fixing functional yields a smaller value of the center - projected string tension .",
    "it is then doubtful whether the latter can be equal to the non - abelian string tension in the limit where the global maximum of the gauge - fixing functional is approached and the physical volume sent to infinity .",
    "the authors of @xcite and those of @xcite vary in the interpretation of these numerical results , but concur that they put the usefulness of the maximal center gauge in jeopardy .",
    "our own interpretation is the following .",
    "because of the lattice periodic boundary conditions , every gauge defect ( monopole in a time - slice , center vortex in a plane ) must be paired with another opposite one .",
    "therefore , a gauge which is sufficiently non - local may bring together the locations of the members of each pair , and produce no net defect at all after projection .",
    "this may well be what happens : in the effort to approach the global maximum , defect pairs annihilate and the projected string tension drops .",
    "this illustrates that the pursuit of the global maximum is of marginal interest , whereas it is essential to pay attention to the locality of the gauge condition ( in our case , of the operator used to fix the gauge ) , as we have emphasized in the discussion section v. a similar claim that the maximal abelian gauge suppresses monopoles excessively , but that the laplacian gauge does not , was already argued in @xcite .",
