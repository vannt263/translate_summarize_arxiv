    "the understanding of the structure and evolution of neutron stars , and the cataclysmic events generating them , is strongly related to our knowledge of the microphysics of dense matter .",
    "additionally , the implementation of the equation of state ( eos ) in compact - star modeling presents a double challenge : first , knowledge of the structure and dynamics of hadronic matter over different domains of temperature , density and composition is needed - including important phase transitions and interactions with leptons and photons ; second , this knowledge must be weaved together and modeled in such a way , that numerical studies and simulations are feasible .",
    "terrestrial experiments on nuclei , including systems under extreme conditions , are performed and analysed worldwide in order to meet the former challenge .",
    "it remains a non - trivial task to model and tabulate the acquired information into usable form for astrophysical applications .    in terms of relevant degrees of freedom ,",
    "matter at low temperature and at sub - saturation density is not highly exotic : it will primarily consist of nucleons , leptons , and photons and therefore belong in the domain of low - energy nuclear physics . depending on the situation",
    ", baryonic matter may be almost isospin - symmetric or extremely neutron rich - as in the inner crust of a neutron star .",
    "a liquid - gas phase transition is expected to occur at sub - saturation densities , from non - uniform matter to unbound nucleons .",
    "of particular interest in the present work is the intermediate domain of clusterized matter , where nuclei - as it were , nuclear droplets - coexist with free nucleons , as well as leptons and photons , in thermal and chemical equilibrium . again depending on the conditions ,",
    "different nuclei may be found in this mixture : from very light ones , like deuterons and alpha particles , to iron - group nuclei , and much heavier or exotic species .",

    "@xcite , is the so - called single - nucleus approximation ( sna ) : besides free nucleons , only one kind of light cluster ( alpha particles ) and one kind of heavy cluster are assumed to exist .",
    "the idea is to account in an average way for the properties of the statistical cluster distribution .",
    "the sna may not affect very strongly thermodynamical properties of matter at certain temperature and density domains of interest  @xcite , but it may have consequences for dynamical processes dependent on reaction rates of specific nuclei  @xcite and for the gas - liquid phase transition .",
    "therefore , more modern approaches rely on an extended nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) concept , where the distribution of clusters over , in principle , all mass numbers is taken into account and obtained self - consistently in conditions of statistical equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "originally , the nse was introduced to describe the reaction network taking place at the end of the evolution of massive stars in red supergiants .",
    "being very diluted , nuclei interact weakly and are almost not modified by the surrounding medium .",
    "these conditions naturally lead to the saha equations .",
    "the nse in the dense and hot matter in the core of supernovae was first applied in the eos of hillebrandt and wolff  @xcite . in recent nse implementations",
    "@xcite the interactions between a cluster and the surrounding gas is treated in the so - called excluded - volume approach .",
    "the clusters and the gas of light particles do not overlap in space and the clusters binding energy is kept as in the free limit .",
    "it is known , however , from quantal approaches , that the cluster properties are modified by the coexistence with a gas  @xcite .",
    "such approaches are presently limited to a system of light nuclei .",
    "it is clear that in - medium modifications of larger clusters would also change the composition of matter and the related eos .",
    "it is therefore important to take such effects into account .",
    "this work provides a microscopically based modelling of in - medium properties of nuclei , specifically their ground - state densities and energies .",
    "we focus on medium - mass and heavy clusters .",
    "clusters are first studied microscopically through hartree - fock calculations in wigner - seitz cells .",
    "clustering emerges from the quantal calculation since a dense cluster can be distinguished from a dilute phase .",
    "two different types of clusters can however be defined : a representation in coordinate space , pertinent in excluded - volume approaches ; and another representation in energy space , conceptually similar to existing quantal approaches for light clusters .",
    "next , we study the energies of clusters embeded in a gas , with the help of the local - density approximation ( lda ) , which we validate using our microscopic results .",
    "thanks to our analytical model for density and the lda , configurations away from those accessible within hartree - fock or other variational calculations can be studied and the in - medium modified self - energies can be directly used in the eos modelling at finite temperature .    for",
    "the microscopic calculations we employ the sly4 skyrme functional , but our in - medium densities and energies explicitly depend on the isoscalar and isovector properties of the underlying interaction , and can thus readily be computed for different functionals .",

    "our modelization of clusters embedded in a nucleon gas will initially be informed by microscopic hartree - fock calculations using skyrme functionals .",
    "the hartree - fock equations are solved self - consistently in spherical symmetry in a mesoscopic volume , which can be associated with a wigner - seitz cell .",
    "its radius @xmath0 must be much larger than that of a typical nucleus . here",
    "we will use @xmath1  fm .",
    "implicit here is the assumption , that the clusters are sufficiently far from each other to not interact .",
    "the purpose of the mesoscopic volume in its present use is to allow for the formation of a uniform gas around the cluster .",
    "its radius is not chosen via a condition of charge neutrality .",
    "it is simply an auxiliary quantity which will be eliminated from the final results .",
    "the equations are solved with mixed boundary conditions : dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on odd single - particle states and von neumann conditions on even states . in principle , hartree - fock - bogolyubov calculations could be performed , in order to include pairing  @xcite .",
    "superfluidity is an essential property of dilute star matter  @xcite , but we expect the in - medium modifications due to pairing to be small in comparison with the in - medium modifications due to the mean - field .",
    "as we will show , these latter can be recasted into in - medium modified bulk and surface terms of the cluster energy functional . to correctly constrain such terms from the microscopic calculations and disentangle them from possible pairing terms , we therefore prefer to neglect pairing and stick to a hartree - fock modeling .",

    "the sly4 skyrme functional  @xcite has been chosen at present for the microscopic calculations .",
    "this functional is widely used to calculate ground and excited states of nuclei and it is particularly interesting in studies of dense matter , because is has been adjusted to a realistic eos of symmetric and neutron matter , obtained variationally using the uv14 and uvii potentials  @xcite .",
    "we stress , however , that our modeling will be general in scope , so that it can be easily applicable to different functionals and interactions .    in practice we will study isotopic chains ranging from @xmath12 ( ca ) to @xmath13 ( pb ) . for each @xmath14",
    "we vary the neutron number from somewhat below @xmath14 to approximately 3000 .",
    "we thus obtain a variety of solutions , from stable nuclei to very neutron - rich clusters embedded in a neutron gas of density up to , approximately , 0.02  @xmath15 .",
    "we are therefore able to study microscopically neutron - rich clusterized matter , before the onset of deformation and pasta phases .",
    "the energies and density profiles obtained from the microscopic calculations will be used to validate our analytical models .",
    "the coulomb interaction among protons in stellar matter is screened by the neutralizing electron background .",
    "the associated modification to the cluster coulomb energies is an important in - medium effect which is already accounted for in all eos - nse based models  @xcite . a possible extra effect of coulomb screening on the nuclear part of the energy functional through a modification of the density profile is expected to be small in the very neutron rich nuclei that constitute our microscopic sample  @xcite .      within the local - density approximation ( lda ) ,",
    "the local energy density is determined by the proton and neutron densities and their gradients , while current densities are ignored .",
    "the lda is closely related to the thomas - fermi approach whereby the ground - state properties can be determined by minimizing the energy with respect to variations of the density . for our purposes , using the lda will transpose the problem of determining the cluster energy in - medium correction towards the determination of the nuclear density profile in the wigner - seitz cell .    within the lda , the kinetic energy density is also written in terms of the local density , being replaced by its value in nuclear matter of the corresponding density .",
    "in spherical symmetry we thus write , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fermi momentum of protons and neutrons in infinite matter of density @xmath18 . with these considerations , the energy density in the lda  ( [ eq : skyrmehf ] )",
    "is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tauhf ] ) . the total energy in a spherical cell of radius @xmath0 will be given simply by @xmath22 all that is needed for computing the energy of the system is then its density profile - both the isoscalar and isovector components .",

    "the uniqueness will have to be demonstrated numerically . to this end",
    "we proceed as follows : for given @xmath26 we obtain the analytical density profiles corresponding to nuclei with many different combinations of @xmath226 and with a large variation in particle number , namely from 50 to 400 particles .",
    "this provides us with a value for the bulk asymmetry .",
    "we also calculate @xmath228 as already demonstrated .",
    "we thus obtain , for given @xmath79 and @xmath26 , a number of surface - energy results corresponding to clusters of different populations .",
    "these  data points \" are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : surfenergy_givenrho_paper_one ] and [ fig : surfenergy_givendelta_paper_one ] and discussed below .    [ t ]    let us begin with fig .",
    "[ fig : surfenergy_givenrho_paper_one ] , where @xmath229 is plotted as a function of @xmath79 for the indicated values of gas density ( given in @xmath15 ) . for low gas densities the points form well defined lines , and even at higher gas densities the dispersion of points is moderate .",
    "we conclude that the scaling with respect to @xmath218 indeed holds to a satisfactory degree .",
    "this important result means that the definition we have introduced , eq.([evol ] ) , correctly represents the bulk part of the energy of the cluster .",
    "we notice that eq.([evol ] ) has no dependence on the external gas .",
    "this means that the presence of a medium does not influence the bulk term , which keeps being defined by the local nuclear matter saturation condition whatever the external medium .",
    "this demonstrates that the energy increase of the cluster with increasing neutron gas observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : justifylda ] is not an in - medium effect , but simply reflects the decreasing saturation density ( and increasing surface energy , see below ) associated to an increasing bulk asymmetry .",
    "the points forming the line for @xmath230 correspond to isolated nuclei . for small asymmetries ,",
    "a roughly quadratic law is observed .",
    "interestingly , the line is convex around zero asymmetry , implying , in a liquid - drop picture , a positive surface - symmetry coefficient , in qualitative agreement with certain calculations in semi - infinite matter  @xcite , but in contrast with many evaluations from the literature  @xcite , including ones based on the sly4 interaction  @xcite .",
    "our result , which we found quite robust with respect to approximations involved ( for example , the use of lda instead of hartree - fock energies ) , warrants further investigations in the future .",
    "to some extent the discrepancies may be due to employing different definitions for the nuclear surface and different partitions between the volume and surface energies  @xcite , as well as due to our use of the bulk asymmetry @xmath231 rather than the global asymmetry @xmath232 as the relevant parameter .",
    "we observe that , as the neutron - gas density increases , the surface energy decreases . on the neutron - rich side",
    "this is easy to understand if we consider the limiting case of a gas with the same density and asymmetry as the cluster , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : surfenlim ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the various lines are not symmetric around zero . this should be expected , since a proton - rich cluster in a neutron - rich gas is physically a very different entity from a neutron - rich cluster in a neutron - rich gas .",
    "it is worth noting that the functional dependence at low or negative asymmetries could not have been inferred from our hartree - fock calculations , which naturally favor neutron - rich clusters . only the analytical model for the density profiles could probe this extended domain .",
    "the only assumption related to energy minimization is that the bulk density of the cluster equals the saturation density at the given value of asymmetry .",
    "a different bulk energy would imply compression ( or decompression ) , which would cost too much energy to be counter - balanced .    of course ,",
    "symmetric ( not to mention , proton - rich ) clusters would not survive in a neutron gas in most situations of interest , in particular low - temperature asymmetric matter in the crust of a neutron star . at sufficiently high temperatures ,",
    "though , such configurations could become active and their correct treatment might be important .",
    "we now turn to fig .",
    "[ fig : surfenergy_givendelta_paper_one ] , where the quantity @xmath233 is plotted for the indicated values of asymmetry as a function of gas density .",
    "we notice again that it scales well with @xmath218 and it generally decreases for higher gas densities .",
    "we stress once more that the functional forms for the lower asymmetries would not have been possible to obtain based on an unconstrained variational calculation .",
    "[ t ]    the functional form of the surface energy obtained here goes beyond the somewhat heuristic approaches to the surface energy introduced in refs .  @xcite . as a general statement",
    ", it appears that simple analytic estimations of surface corrections can be largely inaccurate and the complete result from the lda has to be considered . as an example",
    ", one may suppose that the in - medium corrections can be simply taken into account through the transformation from _ r - clusters _ to _ e - clusters_. indeed , we have seen that _ e - clusters _ can be interpreted as the ensemble of single - particle wave functions ( bound and resonant ) in the cluster region , with the exclusion of the continuum states that represent the external gas . in this picture",
    "one should have : @xmath234 where @xmath235 can depend on the cluster asymmetry but should not depend on the gas .",
    "since @xmath236 , the uniform - matter limit ( [ eq : surfenlim ] ) is automatically satisfied . replacing into eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) we get @xmath237^{2/3 }   s(\\delta_{r - cl},0 )   .",
    "\\label{eq : ansatzjm}\\ ] ] the results for @xmath238 are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : surfenergy_givenrho_paper_one ] ( line marked  ( 0.02 ) \" ) . for extremely neutron - rich clusters the ansatz works",
    "quite well , but , being symmetric around zero asymmetry , it fails to reproduce the correct trends at lower asymmetries .    finally , it is worth commenting on an ansatz which we tried at earlier stages of this work  @xcite .",
    "inspired by the liquid - drop formula and the conditions ( [ eq : surfenlim ] ) ,  ( [ eq : surfensym ] ) , it was proposed : @xmath239   \\nonumber \\\\   & = &   a_s\\left ( 1 - \\frac{\\rho_{gas}}{\\rho_0(\\delta_{r - cl})}\\right)^2   \\nonumber \\\\    & & + a_{ssym }   \\left ( \\delta_{r - cl } - \\frac{\\rho_{gas}}{\\rho_0(\\delta_{r - cl})}\\right)^2   , \\label{eq : ansatzpp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath235 and @xmath240 liquid - drop constants such that the surface energies for @xmath241 are reproduced .",
    "the surface - symmetry parameter @xmath240 was therefore positive .",
    "an excellent agreement of this ansatz with the hartree - fock results of neutron - rich clusters in a neutron gas was observed  @xcite .",
    "we now notice from its analytical form , that this ansatz predicts a larger surface energy for a proton - rich cluster than for a neutron - rich one ( in a neutron gas ) , i.e. , the opposite effect than what our lda approach gave .",
    "this is not to say that proton - rich clusters in a neutron gas are a particularly relevant configuration , however this outcome demonstrates the risks of relying on hartree - fock results to derive general trends .",
    "the disagreement between our ansatz and the lda results is further demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : surfenergy_givendelta_paper_one ] . the surface energy given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatzpp ] ) with @xmath242 and @xmath243 corresponds to the thinner curves ( the scaling with @xmath244 is respected by construction ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : surfenergy_givendelta_paper_one ] .",
    "the choice of @xmath235 and @xmath240 is such , that for isolated nuclei , @xmath241 , the lda and the ansatz give the same result . for low gas densities , below @xmath245@xmath15",
    ", there is reasonable agreement .",
    "it is obvious , however , that there are large deviations in various domains of gas density and asymmetry .",
    "this work presents a quasi - analytic modelling of the in - medium modifications to cluster density profiles and energies , when these latter are immersed in a dilute nucleon gas , as it is the case for the stellar matter which is produced in the core of supernova and in the crust of neutron stars .",
    "our approach is valid in principle for all but the lightest nuclei , where there are not enough nucleons to yield saturated matter .",
    "the density profile in a wide number of nuclei and wigner - seitz cells , as obtained from hartree - fock calculations with the sly4 effective interaction , have been analyzed and fitted through woods - saxon functions showing a continuous description from isolated nuclei to nuclei in a medium .",
    "we have discussed two alternative possible representations of clusters inside a medium , depending on the local density ( coordinate - space clusters ) or on the energy of the single - particle states ( energy - space clusters ) . using these two representation and the mapping between them ,",
    "we have been able to propose an analytical self - consistent model to relate the parameters of the woods - saxon functions to the global variables of the eos .",
    "the energies of clusters in a neutron - rich gas were studied with the help of the local - density approximation , which allowed us to investigate configurations which are not explored by the hartree - fock ( in general , variational ) calculations , but are of importance in a finite - temperature stellar environment .",
    "the quality of the lda approximation was tested on the hartree - fock sample .",
    "not surprisingly , this approximation systematically overestimated the microscopic result .",
    "however , the in - medium cluster energy shift is remarkably well reproduced , showing that the influence of the medium is essentially due to the modification of the local density profile .",
    "we have discussed in detail the in - medium effects due to a pure neutron gas , which is relevant for the physics of the neutron star crust . for this case , we have demonstrated through the comparison with the microscopic calculations that neither the isoscalar nor the isovector part of the bulk energy of the clusters in the coordinate space representation are affected by the external gas , and the global bulk energy only depends on the bulk asymmetry of the cluster . as a consequence , the excluded - volume approach appears as a reasonable zero order approximation to account for bulk in - medium effects .",
    "an important modification of the surface energy of the clusters is however observed .",
    "a decreasing surface tension with increasing density of the gas is observed for all cluster asymmetries .",
    "this leads to a sizeable modification of the cluster energy functional in a dense medium , which will have to be accounted for to have reliable eos s for astrophysical applications in a near future .    in the future",

    "the radius corresponds to the inflection point of the woods - saxon profile , @xmath254 and can be readily obtained by numerical differentiation of the microscopic density .",
    "all radial derivatives are calculated at 5-point precision .",

    "we then determine the value of the density as well as its derivative at this point , by interpolation , @xmath255 and @xmath256 , respectively .",
    "the value of the radius as well as the density and its derivatives are thus determined directly from the microscopic density profile and remain fixed during the fit .",

    "initially we determine the minimum and maximum numerical value of @xmath263 within a radius equal to @xmath264 , @xmath265 and @xmath266 , respectively .",
    "if we determine the minimal value of the density up to a value too close to @xmath24 , we run the risk of accidentally accepting a too - low value of @xmath39 .",
    "on the other hand , we wish to avoid that the minimal and maximal values are too - restricted , due to their limitation up to @xmath264 .",
    "indeed , it is likely that the shoulder of the density profile is critical for a correct determination of @xmath39 .",
    "therefore we extend the allowed interval by considering that , for genuine woods - saxon profiles , we have : @xmath267 taking this into account , the minumum and maximum acceptable values for @xmath39 are determined by @xmath268 finally we vary , within the acceptable intervals and by sufficiently small steps , both @xmath39 and @xmath26 in nested loops . at each step",
    "we proceed as follows : the diffuseness parameter is estimated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : adiffws ] ) .",
    "we can then calculate the number of particles corresponding to the given woods - saxon profile .",
    "if it deviates from the desired value by more than @xmath269 , we reject the current values of @xmath270 and continue .",
    "if it is close to the desired value within @xmath269 , we calculate also the standard deviation , @xmath271 .",
    "if this is lower than the stored value of @xmath173 , then @xmath173 is assigned the new value @xmath271 and @xmath272 are assigned the corresponding new values . and so on , until all values have been tried",
    ". it can happen that no combination of values satisfies the criterion ( [ eq : tolerance ] ) .",
    "the reason may be , e.g. , an anomalous decrease or increase of the gas density close to the cell radius , due to the boundary conditions .",
    "then the hartree - fock calculation is rejected .",
