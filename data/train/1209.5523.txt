    "star formation ( sf ) was processing at a much larger rate in galaxies in the first half of the universe history , and the most striking feature in the cosmic sf rate density is the decline by a factor @xmath4 10 since z=1 ( madau 1998 , hopkins & beacom 2006 ) .",
    "several factors could be invoked to explain such a behavior : first the gas fraction in star forming galaxies is likely to have been higher in the past , as already suggested by co surveys , tracing the molecular gas content of galaxies . locally , the gas fraction for giant spirals is about 7 - 10% ( leroy 2008 , saintonge 2011a ) , while at z@xmath41.2 it increases to 34@xmath55% and at z@xmath42.3 to 44@xmath56% ( tacconi 2010 , daddi 2010 ) .",
    "second , the star formation efficiency might have been higher in the past , due to the dynamical trigger of galaxy interactions , whose frequency increases with redshift ( e.g. conselice 2009 , kartaltepe 2010 ) , and also the more violent instabilities in more unstable disks , with lower bulge - to - disk ratios .",
    "the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) defined as the ratio of sfr to gas content , has been observed to increase with redshift ( e.g. greve 2005 ) , even for the most extreme starbursts , represented by ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirg ) .",
    "this tendency is however supported mainly by comparing local and high - z galaxies , at z@xmath61 , and very little is known about the molecular gas content of galaxies at intermediate redshift between z=0.2 and 1 .",
    "this co desert is mainly due to observational difficulties , and motivated our co survey of starburst galaxies in this redshift range .",
    "a first study at 0.2@xmath7z@xmath70.6 ( combes 2011 ) has indeed confirmed a strong increase of sfe in this redshift range .     for @xmath8/@xmath9 proposed by obreschkow & rawlings ( 2009 ) .",

    "we have now completed our co survey of 69 starburst galaxies with 0.2@xmath7z@xmath71.0 , and obtained a global detection rate of 48% .",
    "since the conversion factor is a key parameter in this study , we have obtained co detections in several j - lines for a dozen of galaxies , and found different excitation for the gas . when the gas mass could be derived from the dust emission however , the resulting values conforted our adoption of the @xmath0=0.8 conversion factor ( combes 2012 ) .",
    "mapping of some galaxies with the iram interferometer showed that the molecular gas is extended at kpc scales , and not only confined to a nuclear component ( combes 2006 , and in prep . ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that the data gap at intermediate redshift is now filled .",
    "the co luminosities of starburst galaxies display an envelope which is constantly rising with redshift in this interval .",

    "the increase of both star formation efficiency and gas fraction with redshift in the intermediate range for starburst galaxies suggests that both factors play a role in driving the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density . the relative influence of each physical quantity is strongly linked to the co - to- conversion factor .",
    "if a standard milky way ratio is used for these galaxies , their gas fraction will then dominate the evolution .",
    "we have tried to relate the star formation efficiency to the compactness of the starburst , measured from the half - light radius in the i - band ( corresponding to the blue band in the rest frame ) .",
    "there is indeed an anticorrelation of sfe with half - light radius , but with a large scatter .",
    "the sfe was also plotted with respect to the specific star formation rate ( or sfr per unit stellar mass ) , and compared to the locus of local `` normal '' star forming galaxies from the cold gass survey ( saintonge 2011b ) .",
    "the starburst galaxies are globally located below , meaning that their gas content is significantly higher .",
