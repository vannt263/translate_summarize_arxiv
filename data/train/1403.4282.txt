    "owing to the rapid development of high - power laser technology , in recent years we observe a renaissance of theoretical interest in studying strong - field quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) processes  @xcite .",
    "note that proceeding theoretical works were based on the monochromatic plane wave approximation  @xcite .",
    "however , with the parallel development of computational technology , it is possible now to extend these explorations and to study fundamental qed processes in multichromatic laser fields  @xcite or in short laser pulses  @xcite .",
    "new aspects of strong - field qed such as the electron ( positron ) polarization effects  @xcite , the energy and angular correlations  @xcite , the bremsstrahlung process at relativistically intense laser radiation  @xcite , or the electron - positron cascades  @xcite , are of great interest nowadays .",
    "usually , different types of cross sections or probability distributions are analyzed , leaving out problems related to the phase of probability amplitudes .",
    "however , in many cases , it is the global phase that plays a significant role .",
    "for instance , it is a very important parameter when studying coherence of high - order harmonics and the synthesis of attosecond pulses @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall study the important role played by the global phase of probability amplitudes in nonlinear compton scattering  @xcite and its classical approximation  nonlinear thomson scattering  @xcite . for the classical theory",
    "we discuss the conditions of its applicability .",
    "we show that , in order to get comparable temporal power distributions from both theories , an extra condition on the compton phase has to be imposed .",
    "we also propose the method of controlling the energy distribution of emitted radiation by properly modulated laser pulses such that it leads to the generation of coherent high - order harmonics combs .",
    "in addition , we investigate properties of the synthesized short radiation pulses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ pulse ] , we define temporal and polarization properties of the laser pulses considered .",
    "supplementary definitions of mutually orthogonal and normalized triad of vectors for two ( in general elliptic ) polarizations and for the direction of pulse propagation are discussed in appendix  [ triads ] .",
    "the basic theoretical scheme of the laser - induced qed compton scattering is presented in sec .",
    "[ compton ] , together with the derivation of the global phase for the compton amplitude .",
    "we show that the total phase can be split into the kinematic and the dynamic parts .",
    "the kinematic phase is independent of the electron spin degrees of freedom ( hence , it is applicable also to the compton scattering of spin-0 particles ) .",
    "while it can be derived analytically ( see , eq .  ) , the dynamic phase can be determined only numerically . for the pulses considered in this paper",
    ", the dynamic phase appears to be independent of the frequency of photons generated during the process .",
    "the reader can find more details in appendix  [ diffcom ] .",
    "the analogous analysis for nonlinear classical thomson scattering is presented in sec .",
    "[ thomson ] and appendix  [ diffthom ] . in secs .",
    "[ compton ] and [ thomson ] , we also compare the predictions of quantum and classical approaches for the energy distributions of emitted radiation , drawing particular attention to the different dependence of the global phase on the frequency of generated radiation .",
    "as we show , this is related to the quantum recoil of electrons during the emission of photons .",
    "we demonstrate in sec .",
    "[ synthesis ] that the frequency dependence of the global phase plays a vital role in the temporal synthesis of generated radiation .",
    "we conclude that the quantum recoil effects result in a broader temporal distribution of radiation power for compton scattering as compared to the predictions drawn from the classical theory .",
    "the interference of photons generated in compton scattering by a modulated laser pulse ( which consists of subpulses ) is investigated in sec .",
    "[ combs ] . in sec .",
    "[ combsdelay ] , we show how the distance between the peaks in the energy spectrum can be controlled by the time delay of such subpulses .",
    "although the presented results are for compton scattering , we remark that a similar pattern is expected also for classical thomson scattering provided that the frequencies are much smaller than the cut - off frequency for the quantum process .",
    "the analysis of the frequency combs in the laboratory frame is presented in sec .",
    "[ combslab ] , with special emphasis on the partially angular - integrated energy distributions .",
    "this sort of investigation is related to the fact that the frequency - comb structure is very sensitive to the direction of emission of generated radiation . because quantum calculations are numerically demanding ,",
    "in this analysis we choose frequencies much smaller than the cut - off frequency , which ensures that the classical calculations provide similar results . by doing this ,",
    "we show that the comb structure survives the partial angular integration and , in principle , can be detected experimentally . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we draw some conclusions .    in analytical formulas we put @xmath0 .",
    "hence , the fine - structure constant is @xmath1 . we use this constant also in expressions derived from classical electrodynamics , where it is meant to be multiplied by @xmath2 when restoring the physical units . unless stated otherwise , in numerical analysis we use relativistic units ( rel .",

    "moreover , when comparing results for different shapes of laser pulses we have to impose extra conditions .",
    "for instance , by assuming that the flow of laser radiation per unit surface and unit time ( i.e. , the intensity @xmath29 ) for different durations of laser pulses is independent of @xmath26 , we have to keep @xmath31 .",
    "this leads to @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "on the other hand , if we assume that the averaged energy flow per unit surface ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) is fixed , we have to put @xmath35 , and @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "the latter situation could be met in experiments , as the energy of a laser pulse and a size of the laser focus are quite often given whereas the time - duration is changed .    in our numerical illustrations",
    ", we shall choose the linearly polarized laser pulse , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and use the shape functions with the @xmath40-type envelope , @xmath41 where the proportionality constant is determined by the normalization condition  .",

    "@xmath44 also establishes the central frequency @xmath28 , which is considered to be fixed and equal to @xmath45 in the laboratory frame .",
    "this corresponds to a ti - sapphire laser beam of wavelength @xmath46 .",
    "let us also remark that , while for @xmath47 we have @xmath48 , for @xmath49 the vector potential has to vanish as well .",
    "this is automatically satisfied if @xmath50 , whereas for @xmath51 the envelope phase @xmath42 must be equal to 0 or @xmath52 .",

    "we would like to emphasize that the nonlinear dependence of the compton phase on the frequency of emitted photons ( contrary to the thomson phase , which linearly depends on @xmath111 ) is of the quantum origin .",
    "such a qualitative difference between the classical and quantum results can be associated with a change of the electron final momentum in the compton scattering , which introduces decoherence in the process .",

    "our main interest in this paper is nonlinear compton scattering rather than its classical analogue , which is nonlinear thomson scattering .",
    "the point being that the classical approach is an approximation of the complete quantum theory which takes into account the electron spin and the quantum recoil of electrons during the scattering .",
    "the complication being , that the quantum theory does now allow for as detailed description of the driving laser beam as the classical theory does . also , it is more demanding computationally .",

    "[ qpuls16x01d201309020 ] .",
    "we want to emphasize that the reason for such a qualitative discrepancy between the classical and the quantum processes is the highly nonlinear dependence of the compton phase on the frequency of emitted photons .",

    "the great advantage of the classical approach is that calculations can be carried out quite easily , even for an arbitrary space and time dependent laser field .",
    "for this reason , the classical approach is extensively used in plasma physics and also in the context of ultra - short pulse generation @xcite . even though thomson theory has some important shortcomings .",
    "for instance , it does not account for the spin of electrons , which for the high - frequency part of the spectrum starts to play a significant role @xcite , especially for very short and intense laser pulses .",
    "another defect of the classical theory , which appears to be crucial for the extremely short pulse generation , is that it neglects the recoil of electrons during the emission of high - frequency photons @xcite .",
    "it has been noted that the electron recoil effects are small if @xmath159 independently of the laser field intensity , @xmath29 , and also of the laser field carrier frequency , @xmath30 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is well - known from the fourier analysis that in order to generate the shorter radiation pulses the broader energy spectra have to be used for the pulse synthesis .",
    "there are two possibilities to increase the bandwidth of the energy distribution in thomson or compton processes .",
    "namely , one can either increase the energy of electron beams or increase the intensity of the laser beam .",
    "mostly , the second scenario is used @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this section show that this scenario does not work for sufficiently intense laser pulses such that photons of frequencies comparable to @xmath117 are created with significant probabilities .",
