    "compact stars have a large number of pulsation modes that have been extensively studied since the seminal work of chandrasekhar on radial oscillations @xcite . in general , these modes are very difficult to observe in the electromagnetic spectrum ; therefore most efforts have concentrated on gravitational wave asteroseismology in order to characterise the frequency and damping times of the modes that emit gravitational radiation . in particular , various works focused on the oscillatory properties of pure hadronic stars , hybrid stars and strange quark stars trying to find signatures of the equation of state of high density neutron star matter ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , compact star oscillations have attracted the attention in the context of soft gamma ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , which are persistent x - ray emitters that sporadically emit short bursts of soft @xmath3-rays . in the quiescent state ,",
    "sgrs have an x - ray luminosity of @xmath4 erg / s , while during the short @xmath3-bursts they release up to @xmath5 erg / s in episodes of about 0.1 s. exceptionally , some of them have emitted very energetic giant flares which commenced with brief @xmath3-ray spikes of @xmath6 s , followed by tails lasting hundreds of seconds .",
    "hard spectra ( up to 1 mev ) were observed during the spike and the hard x - ray emission of the tail gradually faded modulated at the neutron star ( ns ) rotation period .",
    "the analysis of x - ray data of the tails of the giant flares of sgr 0526 - 66 , sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806 - 20 revealed the presence of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) with frequencies ranging from @xmath7 18 to 1840 hz @xcite .",
    "there are also candidate qpos at higher frequencies up to @xmath8 khz in other bursts but with lower statistical significance @xcite ; in fact , according to a more recent analysis only one burst shows a marginally significant signal at a frequency of around 3706 hz @xcite .",
    "several characteristics of sgrs are usually explained in terms of the _ magnetar _ model , assuming that the object is a neutron star with an unusually strong magnetic field ( @xmath9 g ) @xcite . in particular ,",
    "giant flares are associated to catastrophic rearrangements of the magnetic field .",
    "such violent phenomena are expected to excite a variety of oscillation modes in the stellar crust and core .",
    "in fact , recent studies have accounted for magnetic coupling between the crust and the core , and associate qpos to global magneto - elastic oscillations of highly magnetized neutron stars @xcite .",
    "there has also been interest in the possible excitation of low order @xmath10-modes because of their strong coupling to potentially detectable gravitational radiation @xcite .    in the present paper we focus on radial oscillations of neutron stars permeated by ultra - strong magnetic fields .",
    "these modes might be relevant within the magnetar model because they could be excited during the violent events associated with gamma flares .",
    "since they have higher frequencies than the already known qpos , they can not be directly linked to them at present . however , it is relevant to know all the variety of pulsation modes of strongly magnetized neutron stars because the number of observations is still small and new features could emerge in future flares data . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of rotating objects we can expect some amount of gravitational radiation from even the lowest ( @xmath11 ) quasi - radial mode @xcite making them potentially relevant for gravitational wave astronomy .",

    "@xcite , the anisotropic effects around @xmath100  g are small , thus we restrict ourselves to magnetic fields below this value .",
    "however , the purely field - related pressure @xmath102 may become dominant in the core of the star .",
    "in such cases , the total pressure perpendicular to the magnetic field lines would be significantly larger than the pressure parallel to the field lines .",
    "therefore , 3d or at least 2d stellar structure equations should be used in order to incorporate the effect of the pressure anisotropy .",
    "we must stress however , that the magnetic field geometry inside a neutron star can be extremely complex , and depending on its configuration the use of the spherically symmetric stellar structure equations can still be a good enough approximation , as we argue below .",
    "if we consider , for example , a purely dipole field ( purely poloidal field ) , a 1d stellar structure calculation would be certainly inappropriate for some very high field objects .",
    "but such configuration is unstable and can not be realised in nature ; in fact , any neutron star with a purely poloidal or a purely toroidal magnetic field is unstable in general relativity ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this strongly supports the idea that any long - lived magnetic field configuration in a ns has to consist of a mixture of poloidal and toroidal field components . on the other hand , while stellar shapes have long been considered to be oblate due to the effects of centrifugal and/or magnetic forces , this is not necessarily true .",
    "for example , it has been found recently that the shape of our sun is perfectly round , against the common expectation of an oblate shape due to its rotation @xcite .    in the specific case of neutron stars",
    ", the results found thus far are that purely poloidal magnetic fields make stars oblate ( equatorial radius larger than polar radius ) , while purely toroidal magnetic fields lead stars to become prolate ( polar radius larger than equatorial radius ) .",
    "very recently , it has been shown that equilibrium states of magnetized stars with mixed poloidal@xmath103toroidal magnetic fields are possible ; in particular , it was possible to build neutron stars with twisted - torus configurations in equilibria with any toroidal and poloidal field energy content @xcite .",
    "such poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields act as increasing and decreasing mechanisms for stellar oblateness , respectively @xcite .",
    "an additional finding of ref .",
    "@xcite is that for a fixed polar magnetic field strength , a higher relative content of toroidal field energy ( @xmath104 ) implies in general a much higher total ( poloidal and toroidal ) magnetic energy inside the star .",
    "this means that a highly magnetized neutron star can harbor internal magnetic fields that are significantly stronger than commonly expected .",
    "in addition , a very complex field is expected from the formation process of magnetized neutron stars , since they are born hot , highly convective and differentially rotating @xcite . during its early evolution ,",
    "neutron star s magnetic fields can be significantly amplified and redistributed by several mechanisms including possibly dynamo action and shear instabilities . in this context",
    ", a distribution of magnetic energy with poloidal and toroidal fields close to equipartition appears as a very reasonable candidate for the internal magnetic field configuration .",
    "in such a case , since both the toroidal and poloidal components are of the same order , we may expect that oblateness and prolateness cancel out approximately , leading to stars close to the spherical symmetry .",
    "since a study of stellar pulsations in 2d or 3d is numerically involving , we shall adopt spherical symmetry as a first approximation , and use the much more simple 1d equations . within this approach",
    ", we must add to the matter pressure ( @xmath101 ) given in sec .",
    "[ sec : a ] , an effective mean magnetic pressure @xmath105 representing the effective isotropic contribution arising from the combined effect of poloidal and toroidal field components of the same order .",
    "thus , the total energy density and the total pressure of the system read : @xmath106^{2 } , \\\\ p & = & p_{m}+p_{l } + p_b   .\\label{et222}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for finding the effective mean magnetic pressure @xmath105 we shall follow here an averaging procedure similar to the one employed in works that focus on the study of magnetic fluctuations in turbulent fluids @xcite .",
    "the magnetic stress tensor @xmath107 is given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the kronecker tensor and the brackets @xmath110 denote the averaging . for a completely isotropic distribution of the magnetic field we have @xmath111 , and",
    "the magnetic stress tensor reads @xmath112 the effective mean magnetic pressure @xmath105 is related to the magnetic stress tensor by @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , we find : @xmath114^{2 }   .",
    "\\label{wa1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a similar expression has been used in @xcite for studying the influence of asymmetry on a magnetized proto - neutron star .",
    "in order to study the radial oscillations of a compact star , we must know first its equilibrium configuration .",
    "such configuration is perturbed in such a way that the spherical symmetry of the body is not violated . the space - time and fluid perturbations",
    "are inserted into the einstein equations and into the energy , momentum and baryon number conservation equations , assuming a sinusoidal time dependence @xmath115 and retaining only the first - order terms .",
    "the result of this procedure is a second order ordinary differential equation for the perturbations @xcite or alternatively a set of two first order ordinary differential equations , as shown below . in the following",
    "we present the explicit form of the equilibrium and oscillation equations employed in the present work .",
    "we consider that the unperturbed compact star is totally composed of a perfect fluid . in this case",

    "in this section we analyse the effect that a strong magnetic field could produce on the fundamental mode of the radial oscillations of hadronic stars . as mentioned before , we consider that the magnetic field decays with the density following the fast and slow profiles presented in section [ b - density - depndence ] .",
    "all the models for hadronic stars investigated in the present work have a maximum mass in agreement with the recent observation of the pulsars psr j1614 - 2230 with @xmath145 @xcite and psr j0348 - 0432 with @xmath146 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we see that a magnetic field profile with @xmath147 g , produces very small changes on the oscillation period of the fundamental mode with respect to an unmagnetized star , for both slow and fast decays .",
    "this can be explained by the small effect that such magnetic field intensity has on the equation of state .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath148 g is selected , there is a clear change in the oscillation period . as a function of the stellar mass ,",
    "the curves fall below and to the right of the curves for weaker fields . notice that for large mass objects the period changes because of the shift of the curves due to the increase of the maximum stellar mass . for smaller masses ,",
    "the curves for @xmath148 g are also significantly different with respect to the unmagnetized case ; e.g. for a neutron star with @xmath149 the period is around @xmath150 smaller , and the difference increases for less massive stars .",
    "for completeness we present also the oscillation period as a function of the gravitational redshift ( see middle panel of fig . [ fig1 ] ) and as a function of the central mass - energy density ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the effect of strong magnetic fields is more apparent in the frequency of the fundamental mode as can be seen in fig .",
    "the oscillation frequency for @xmath147 g is slightly above the one of an unmagnetized object of the same mass , and there is almost no difference between the fast and the slow decaying profiles of the magnetic field .",
    "however , if @xmath148 g the oscillation frequencies are clearly larger than for an unmagnetized star of the same mass .",
    "for example , for a star with @xmath149 the frequency is around @xmath150 larger and for a @xmath151 star it is around @xmath152 larger .",
    "the difference between the fast and the slow decaying profiles of @xmath13 is very small .    as stated before",
    ", purely radial modes do not emit gravitational waves and consequently they are essentially damped by the bulk viscosity , originated from the re - establishment of chemical equilibrium when a fluid element of the star is compressed and rarified during pulsations .",
    "unfortunately , there is great uncertainty about the amount of viscosity inside neutron stars since it depends sensitively on the composition of matter which is uncertain beyond few times the nuclear saturation density @xcite .",
    "if the damping time due to viscous forces is long enough , radial pulsations in magnetars can leave an imprint in the microstucture of magnetar flare lightcurves opening a new window for the study of highly magnetized ultradense matter .",
