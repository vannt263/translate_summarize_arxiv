    "this way , the contribution to neutrino mixing from the diagonalization of the charged leptons can be of @xmath28 , while those in the neutrino sector of @xmath37 . in addition , in the lin model these large corrections do not affect @xmath26 and satisfy the relation @xmath38 , with @xmath39 being the ckm - like cp violating phase of the lepton sector .",
    "thus , in the lin model the nlo corrections to the solar angle @xmath26 and to the reactor angle @xmath15 can be naturally of different orders .",

    "these terms from the charged lepton sector , numerically of order @xmath37 , would then generically also affect @xmath15 .",

    "3 ) models where bm mixing holds in the neutrino sector and large corrections to @xmath26 and @xmath15 arise from the diagonalization of charged leptons .",
    "the value of @xmath15 could naturally be close to the present experimental range . in each of these possible models",
    "the dominant corrections to the lo mixing pattern involve a number of parameters of the same order of magnitude , @xmath41 .",
    "we discuss the success rate corresponding to the optimal value of @xmath41 for each model , obtained by scanning the parameter space according to a similar procedure for all three cases .",
    "we argue that , while the absolute values of the success rates depend on the scanning assumptions , their relative values in the three classes of models , provide a reliable criterium for comparison .",
    "we find that , for reproducing the mixing angles , the lin type models have the best performance , as expected , followed by the typical @xmath0 models while the bm mixing models lead to an inferior score , as they most often fail to reproduce @xmath26 .",
    "we then discuss the implications for lepton flavour - violating ( lfv ) processes of the above three classes of possibilities , assuming a supersymmetric context , with or without see - saw .",
    "the present bounds pose severe constraints on the parameter space of the models ( for a recent general analysis on model - independent flavour violating effects in the context of flavour models , see ref .",
    "in particular , we refer to the recent improved meg result @xcite on the @xmath3 branching ratio , @xmath42 at @xmath43 c.l . and to other similar processes like @xmath44 .",
    "one expects that lepton flavour - violating processes may also have a large discriminating power in assessing the relative merits of the different models .",
    "we have studied this by adopting the simple cmssm framework . while this overconstrained version of supersymmetry is rather marginal after the results of the lhc searches , more so",
    "if the higgs mass really is around @xmath45 gev , we still believe it can be used here for our indicative purposes .",
    "we find that the most constrained versions are the models with bm mixing at lo where relatively large corrections directly appear in the off - diagonal terms of the charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "the @xmath0 models turn out to be the best suited to satisfy the experimental bounds , as the non - diagonal charged lepton matrix elements needed to reproduce the mixing angles are quite smaller .",
    "an intermediate score is achieved by the models of the lin type , where the main corrections to the mixing angles arise from the neutrino sector .",
    "overall the @xmath0 models emerge well from our analysis and in particular those of the lin type perhaps appear as the most realistic approach to the data among the discrete flavour group models that we have studied .",
    "as for the regions of the cmssm parameter space that are indicated by our analysis , the preference is for small @xmath4 and large susy masses ( at least one out of @xmath46 and @xmath47 must be above 1 tev ) . as a consequence it appears impossible , at least within the cmssm model , to satisfy the meg bound and",

    ", the rather large value measured for @xmath15 , close to the old chooz bound , has validated the prediction of models based on anarchy @xcite , i.e. no symmetry in the leptonic sector , only chance , so that this possibility remains valid , as discussed , for example , in ref .",
    "anarchy can be formulated in a @xmath326 context by taking different froggatt - nielsen@xcite charges only for the @xmath327 tenplets ( for example @xmath328 , where 3 is the charge of the first generation , 2 of the second , zero of the third ) while no charge differences appear in the @xmath329 ( @xmath330 ) .",
    "anarchy can be mitigated by assuming that it only holds in the 2 - 3 sector with the advantage that the first generation masses and the angle @xmath15 are naturally small ( see also the recent revisiting in ref.@xcite ) . in models with see - saw , one can also play with the charges for the right - handed su(5 ) singlet neutrinos . if , for example , one takes @xmath331 , together with @xmath332 , it is possible to get a normal hierarchy model with @xmath15 small and also with @xmath333 naturally small ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in summary , anarchy and its variants ,",
    "all based on chance , offer a rather economical class of models that are among those encouraged by the new @xmath15 result . on the other extreme , stimulated by the fact that the data suggest some special mixing patterns as good first approximations ( tb or bm , for example ) , models based on discrete flavour symmetries , like @xmath0 or @xmath1 , have been proposed and widely studied . in these models the starting lo approximation is completely fixed ( no chance ) , but the nlo corrections introduce a number of undetermined parameters .",
    "the recent data on @xmath15 and the meg new upper bound on the lfv process @xmath334 impose a reappraisal of these models , which we have attempted in this paper . in particular , the relatively large value of @xmath15 introduces a marked departure from the tb limit , while the values of @xmath26 and @xmath30 are very close to it .",
    "the challenge is to produce in a natural way a relatively large correction to @xmath15 without affecting too much the other mixing angles .",
    "but one must pay attention that these larger corrective terms introduced to shift @xmath15 from the tb value could appear in the non - diagonal elements of the charged lepton ( and s - lepton ) mass matrix and could induce a too large @xmath334 branching ratio .    as a result of our analysis we find",
    "that , for reproducing the mixing angles , the lin type @xmath0 models have the best performance , as expected , followed by the typical @xmath0 models , while the bm mixing models lead to an inferior score , as they most often fail to reproduce @xmath26 . in the latter case , if only one complex parameter perturbs the bm pattern , there is a strict correlation among the solar and the reactor angle and the success rate increases considerably by selecting a cp violating dirac phase close to @xmath160 .    as for lfv processes",
    "we have addressed the problem by adopting the simple cmssm framework .",
    "while this overconstrained version of supersymmetry is rather marginal after the results of the lhc searches , more so if the higgs mass really is around @xmath45 gev , we still believe it can be used here for our indicative purposes .",
    "we find that the most constrained versions are the models that start with bm mixing at the lo because , in this case , relatively large corrections directly appear in the off - diagonal terms of the charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "the typical @xmath0 models turn out to be the best suited to satisfy the meg experimental bound , as the non - diagonal charged lepton matrix elements needed to reproduce the mixing angles are quite smaller .",
    "an intermediate , still rather good , score is achieved by the models of the lin type , where the main corrections to the mixing angles arise from the neutrino sector . when the fit to the mixing angles and the bounds on lfv processes are combined , the @xmath0 models emerge well from our analysis and in particular those of the lin type perhaps appear as the most realistic approach to the data among the models based on discrete flavour groups that we have studied . as for the regions of the cmssm parameter space that are indicated by our analysis the preference is for small @xmath4 and large susy masses ( at least one out of @xmath46 and @xmath47 must be above 1 tev ) . as a consequence it appears impossible , at least within the cmssm model , to satisfy the meg bound and , at the same time , to reproduce the muon @xmath5 discrepancy .",

    "<S> we compare the performances of the different classes of models in this respect . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider , in a supersymmetric framework , the important implications of these flavour symmetries on lepton flavour violating processes , like @xmath3 and similar processes . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the existing limits constrain these models , once their parameters are adjusted so as to optimize the agreement with the measured values of the mixing angles . in the simplified cmssm context , </S>",
    "<S> adopted here just for indicative purposes , the small @xmath4 range and heavy susy mass scales are favoured by lepton flavour violating processes , which makes it even more difficult to reproduce the reported muon @xmath5 discrepancy .     </S>",
