    "the study on cold atoms is a remarkable research area which has been extended from monoatomic systems to diatomic systems in recent years  @xcite . in these experiments , not only degenerate fermi - fermi  @xcite but also fermi - bose  @xcite mixtures are studied .",
    "principally , the degenerate atoms can be converted into molecules through the resonant photoassociation or magnetoassociation ( fechbash resonance ) .",
    "note that such a compound molecule created by the fechbash resonance is in a quasibound state and hence energetically unstable .",
    "although the quasibound molecules are energetically unstable , most of fermionic atoms can be efficiently converted into molecules with a long lifetime in experiments  @xcite . however , as far as we know , the bare feshbach resonance can not convert either bosonic atoms or fermi - bose mixtures into molecules with high efficiency .    to investigate various novel features of cold molecules",
    ", one must create ground - state molecules with high atom - to - molecule conversion efficiency .",
    "the bare stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap )  @xcite in photoassociation is proposed to enhance the atom - to - molecule conversion efficiency through avoiding quasibound molecules radiation decay .",
    "the success of the stirap technique relies on the existence of the coherent population trapping ( cpt ) state  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , the system can evolve adiabatically in coherent superposition of stable states .",
    "it is easily satisfied for non - interaction systems .",
    "however , the inter - particle collisions make it difficult for interaction systems to evolve adiabatically , which limits a practical efficiency of stirap . comparing with the bare stirap in photoassociation , the stimulated raman adiabatic passage aided by magnetoassociation",
    "is found to be a more efficient technique whose conversion efficiency is not limited by the collisions between atoms  @xcite .",
    "this technique can be applied to a monoatomic system or a diatomic system .",
    "the free atomic states together with the quasibound and ground molecular states constitute a four - level system for which stirap aided by magnetoassociation is applicable .    in this paper , we consider systems consisting of fermionic and bosonic atoms and their compounded fermionic molecules through the technique of stirap aided by magnetoassociation .",
    "we take the @xmath0k-@xmath1rb mixture as an example to show that this technique can convert the two species of atoms into molecules with high efficiency . in comparison with stirap aided by magnetoassociation",
    ", we also show that the bare feshbach resonance can hardly convert @xmath0k-@xmath1rb atoms into molecules .",
    "the influence of the population imbalance between two species on the atom - to - molecule conversion efficiency is also studied . in the next section , we present our model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cpt ] we derive the mean - field dynamical equations through the euler - lagrange equation then obtain the cpt solutions and the corresponding `` two - photon '' resonance condition . in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] we solve the dynamical equations numerically and discuss the corresponding results .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] .",
    "we consider a mixture of fermionic and bosonic atoms which are coupled to a quasibound molecular state via feshbach resonance .",
    "meanwhile , a laser field drives transitions between the quasibound and ground molecular states . for convenience ,",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 stand for the ground states of fermionic and bosonic atoms in the open channel , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the quasibound and ground molecular states in the close channel , respectively .",
    "the state @xmath4 is coupled with states @xmath2 and @xmath3 through a magnetic field with coupling strength @xmath6 and detuning @xmath7 .",
    "additionally , the states @xmath4 and @xmath5 are coupled with each other through a laser field with the coupling strength @xmath8 and detuning @xmath9 . then the hamiltonian describing the above system in the interaction picture is written as , @xmath10 + ( \\delta'+\\mathcal{e}')\\hat{\\psi}^+_g\\hat{\\psi}^{}_g       \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\mathcal{e}'\\hat{\\psi}^+_m\\hat{\\psi}^{}_m -\\frac{\\omega'}{2}[\\hat{\\psi}^+_m\\hat{\\psi}^{}_g + h.c.]\\bigr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) are the annihilation and creation field operators .",
    "they obey the commutation ( + ) or anticommutation ( - ) relations @xmath15_{\\pm } = \\delta_{ij}\\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')$ ] for bosons or fermions , respectively .",
    "the coefficient @xmath16 is the kinetic energy due to the particles motions , and @xmath17 the interaction strength between particles with @xmath18 being the @xmath19-wave scattering length and @xmath20 being the reduced mass . the trapping potential term is not included in the hamiltonian as we merely consider a uniform system .",
    "the system we considered includes both bosonic and fermionic components .",
    "the self - interaction of the bosonic component is distinctly different from that of the fermionic one .",
    "the kinetic energy dominates the intra - species interaction for the fermionic component as there is no @xmath19-wave scattering for two fermions in the same internal state .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the bosonic component for which the interaction energy dominates the kinetic one under most experimental conditions .",
    "thus a very good first approximation is neglecting the intra - species interaction for fermions but neglecting the kinetic energy for bosons .",
    "based on the above consideration , the energy density corresponding to the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , in the hartree approximation , is given by @xmath21-\\frac{\\omega'}{2}[\\psi_m^*\\psi_g+h.c.]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_{bb}'|\\psi_b|^4+\\sum_{i=\\{f , m , g\\}}\\frac{3}{5}a_i'|\\psi_i|^{10/3},\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 represents the complex probability amplitude of the @xmath23th component and @xmath24 .",
    "the effective self - interaction term @xmath25 related to fermions is called pauli blocking term .",
    "one can find that the effective self - interaction is in different power of @xmath26 for bosonic and fermionic components .",
    "this will induce distinct difference between the dynamical equation for the bosonic component and that for the fermionic one .",
    "the mean - field approach is an effective method to solve many - body problems ( particularly valid for systems with a large number of particles ) although the high order quantum correlations are ignored in this approximation  @xcite .",
    "there are different approaches to get the mean - field dynamical equations from hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "a rigorous approach is expanding bosonic and fermionic field operators in terms of conventional creation and annihilation operators , subsequently , substituting them into the heisenberg equations of motion for the field operators ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the evolution of each kind of bosons is determined by a single equation , however , the evolution of @xmath27 fermions is determined by @xmath27 equations . obviously , it is easy to handle the system with bosons but difficult to handle the system containing a large number of fermions .",
    "another approach is based on the euler - lagrange equation with the help of the mean - field lagrangian density  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the approximation attributes to a single evolution equation for each kind of particles .",
    "the difference between the mean - field dynamical equations for bosons and that for fermions arises from the effective self - interaction term .",
    "the method adopted in refs.@xcite is not applicable to our system due to the existence of fermions .",
    "we study the system in terms of mean - field lagrange density , @xmath28 substituting the above mean - field lagrangian density into the euler - lagrange equation @xmath29 , one can get a set of equations for the complex probability amplitudes , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "these equations are shown to guarantee the following identities , @xmath34 which means that the total numbers of species @xmath35 and @xmath36 are conserved , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 being constants . in the following discussion , we assume there is no molecules in the system at the initial time , hence @xmath39 and @xmath40 also denote the initial atom densities of the corresponding species . to simplify the calculation , we let @xmath41 , then the aforementioned dynamical equations for @xmath22 become @xmath42 with the conservation relations @xmath43 and @xmath44 . here",
    "we introduce @xmath45 to characterize the population imbalance between species @xmath35 and @xmath36 , together with further simplified notions : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the population imbalance between two - species atoms is an important parameter affecting the feature of the system .",
    "for example , the population imbalance between fermionic atoms for different spin state  @xcite can induce the superfluid to normal state phase transition .    unlike the monoatomic system  @xcite , the densities of the fermionic and bosonic atoms may be different , which will affect the conventional two - photon resonance condition .",
    "additionally , the nonlinear terms in our system will be changed because of the pauli exclusive principle for fermions .",
    "we will see that the stirap technique aided by feshbach resonance can convert the two species of atoms into molecules with high efficiency , strictly in contrast to the situation with feshbach resonance only .",
    "we assume that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dyna2 ] ) support a cpt steady state with @xmath52 ( the validity of this assumption is supported by our result obtained in the following ) .",
    "we search steady state solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dyna2 ] ) with the help of the following trial wave functions , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are undetermined parameters .",
    "substituting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : solu ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dyna2 ] ) and taking @xmath56 , one can find a set of solutions , @xmath57     \\theta_g = \\theta_f+\\theta^{}_b ,    \\nonumber\\\\[1 mm ] \\mu^{}_f & = & \\lambda_{fb}^{}|\\phi^0_b|^2    + \\lambda_{fg}|\\phi^0_g|^2+a_f^{}|\\phi_f^0|^{4/3 } ,     \\nonumber\\\\ \\mu^{}_b & = & \\lambda_{fb}^{}|\\phi^0_f|^2    + \\lambda_{bb}|\\phi^0_b|^2     + \\lambda_{bg}|\\phi^0_g|^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] together with a restriction condition    @xmath58    this is a result valid for converting mixtures of fermionic and bossonic atoms into fermionic molecules .",
    "the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be obtained directly for concrete systems .",
    "now we are in the position to consider a concrete system consisting of two - species atoms ( saying @xmath0k and @xmath1rb ) and their compounded fermionic molecules . in order to carry out the numerical calculations ,",
    "it is necessary to fix magnitudes of the parameters that affect the atom - to - molecule conversion efficiency .",
    "as we know , @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 refer to the electron and nucleus magnetic moments , @xmath64 the magnetic field ( the resonances occur at @xmath65 )  @xcite . to evaluate the parameter @xmath6 ,",
    "let us recall the form of the @xmath19-wave scattering length between species @xmath35 and @xmath36 : @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath67 is the scattering length far off resonance and @xmath68 the resonance width with @xmath69 being the reduced mass of species @xmath35 and @xmath36 . the scattering length @xmath67 for the @xmath0k-@xmath1rb mixture determined through feshbach spectroscopy is about @xmath70 with @xmath71 being the bohr radius  @xcite , and the expectation value for the width @xmath72 is about @xmath73 g  @xcite .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath74j .",
    "to optimize the conversion efficiency in experiment , one can change the detuning @xmath7 and the interaction between species @xmath35 and @xmath36 by varying the magnetic field b. alternatively , one can also fix the magnetic field but vary @xmath8 to improve the conversion efficiency . in our numerical calculation ,",
    "the magnetic field @xmath64 is fixed to simplify the experimental procedure . for @xmath75",
    "g , the corresponding @xmath19-wave scattering length between species @xmath35 and @xmath36 is about 2950@xmath71 .",
    "if the total atomic density @xmath76 is about @xmath77m@xmath78 and the @xmath19-wave scattering length between @xmath1rb atoms is about 100@xmath71 , it is easy to obtain @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 . since there are no good estimations on molecular scattering lengths , we take the interaction strengths involving molecules to be zero .",

    "@xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are constants to be determined by the laser coupling of the two molecular states .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath92 at @xmath93 .",
    "such an assumption can be realized in experiment through the following procedure . at the initial time , fix the magnetic field at the value far off resonance and prepare @xmath0k and @xmath1rb atoms in their ground states @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "turn on the laser pulse and fix its amplitude at @xmath86 , and then let the magnetic field be suddenly close to the feshbash resonance point . some numerical results on atom - to - molecule conversion with @xmath75 g",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bf ] .",
    "figure [ fig : bf](a ) exhibits that @xmath96 at the initial time , which implies the populations fulfil the cpt solutions while a small deviation begins to appear at about @xmath97 . in spite of the small deviation ,",
    "the final conversion efficiency @xmath98 is about @xmath99 .",
