    "machine learning designs algorithms for the purpose of inferring from finite empirical data a function dependency which can then be used to understand or predict generation of new data .",
    "past research has mainly focused on single task learning problems where the function to be learned is scalar - valued . built upon the theory of scalar - valued reproducing kernels @xcite , kernel methods have proven useful in single task learning , @xcite .",
    "the approach might be justified in three ways .",
    "firstly , as inputs for learning algorithms are sample data , requiring the sampling process to be stable seems inevitable .",
    "thanks to the existence of an inner product , hilbert spaces are the class of normed vector spaces that we can handle best .",
    "these two considerations lead immediately to the notion of reproducing kernel hilbert spaces ( rkhs ) .",
    "secondly , a reasonable learning scheme is expected to make use of the similarity between a new input and the existing inputs for prediction .",
    "inner products provide a natural measurement of similarities .",
    "it is well - known that a bivariate function is a scalar - valued reproducing kernel if and only if it is representable as some inner product of the feature of inputs @xcite . finally , finding a feature map and taking the inner product of the feature of two inputs are equivalent to choosing a scalar - valued reproducing kernel and performing function evaluations of it",
    "this brings computational efficiency and gives birth to the important  kernel trick \" @xcite in machine learning . for references on single task learning and scalar - valued rkhs",
    ", we recommend @xcite .    in this paper , we are concerned with multi - task learning where the function to be reconstructed from finite sample data takes range in a finite - dimensional euclidean space , or more generally , a hilbert space .",
    "motivated by the success of kernel methods in single task learning , it was proposed in @xcite to develop algorithms for multi - task learning in the framework of vector - valued rkhs .",
    "we attempt to contribute to the theory of vector - valued rkhs by studying a special embedding relationship between two vector - valued rkhs .",
    "we shall briefly review existing work on vector - valued rkhs and the associated operator - valued reproducing kernels .",
    "the study of vector - valued rkhs dates back to @xcite .",
    "the notion of matrix - valued or operator - valued reproducing kernels was also obtained in @xcite .",
    "references @xcite were devoted to learning a multi - variate function and its gradient simultaneously .",
    "reference @xcite established the mercer theorem for vector - valued rkhs and characterized those spaces with elements being @xmath0-integrable vector - valued functions .",
    "various characterizations and examples of universal operator - valued reproducing kernels were provided in @xcite .",
    "the latter @xcite also examined basic operations of operator - valued reproducing kernels and extended the bochner characterization of translation invariant reproducing kernels to the operator - valued case .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the refinement relationship of two vector - valued reproducing kernels .",
    "we say that a vector - valued reproducing kernel is a refinement of another kernel of such type if the rkhs of the first kernel contains that of the latter one as a linear subspace and their norms coincide on the smaller space .",
    "the precise definition will be given in the next section after we provide necessary preliminaries on vector - valued rkhs .",
    "the study is motivated by the need of updating a vector - valued reproducing kernel for multi - task machine learning when underfitting or overfitting occurs .",
    "detailed explanations of this motivation will be presented in the next section .",
    "mathematically , a thorough understanding of the refinement relationship is essential to the establishment of a multi - scale decomposition of vector - valued rkhs , which in turn is the foundation for extending multi - scale analysis @xcite to kernel methods .",
    "in fact , a special refinement method by a bijective mapping from the input space to itself provides such a decomposition .",
    "as the procedure is similar to the scalar - valued case , we refer interested authors to @xcite for the details .",
    "the notion of refinement of scalar - valued kernels was initiated and extensively investigated by the first two authors @xcite .",
    "therefore , a general principle we shall follow is to briefly mention or even completely omit arguments that are not essentially different from the scalar - valued case . as we proceed with the study",
    ", it will become clear that nontrivial obstacles in extending the scalar - valued theory to vector - valued rkhs are mainly caused by the complexity in the vector - valued integral representation of the operator - valued reproducing kernels under investigation , by the complicated form of the feature map involved , which is also operator - valued , and by the infinite - dimensionality of the output space in some occasions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we shall introduce necessary preliminaries on vector - valued rkhs and motivate our study from multi - tasking learning in the next section . in section 3",
    ", we shall present three general characterizations of the refinement relationship by examining the difference of two given kernels , the feature map representation of kernels , and the associated kernels on the extended input space . recall that most scalar - valued reproducing kernels",
    "are represented by integrals . in the operator - valued case , we have two types of integral representations : the integral of operator - valued reproducing kernels with respect to a scalar - valued measure , and the integral of scalar - valued reproducing kernels with respect to an operator - valued measure . as a key part of this paper",
    ", we shall investigate in section 4 specifications of the general characterizations when the operator - valued reproducing kernels are given by such integrals . in section 5 ,",
    "we present concrete examples of refinement by looking into translation - invariant operator - valued kernels , hessian of a scalar - valued kernels , hilbert - schmidt kernels , etc .",
    "section 6 treats specially the existence of nontrivial refinements and desirable properties of operator - valued reproducing kernels that can be preserved during the refinement process . in section 7 , we perform two numerical simulations to show the effect of the refinement kernel method in updating operator - valued reproducing kernels for multi - task learning .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section 8 .",
    "to explain our motivation from multi - task learning in details , we first recall the definition of operator - valued reproducing kernels . throughout the paper ,",
    "we let @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote a prescribed set and a separable hilbert space , respectively .",
    "we shall call @xmath1 the input space and @xmath2 the output space . to avoid confusion , elements in @xmath1 and @xmath2 will be denoted by @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , respectively . unless specifically mentioned ,",
    "all the normed vector spaces in the paper are over the field @xmath5 of complex numbers .",
    "let @xmath6 be the set of all the bounded linear operators from @xmath2 to @xmath2 , and @xmath7 its subset of those linear operators @xmath8 that are positive , namely , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the inner product on @xmath2 . the adjoint of @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath6-valued reproducing kernel _ on @xmath1 is a function @xmath13 such that @xmath14 for all @xmath15 , and such that for all @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 for each @xmath6-valued reproducing kernel @xmath21 on @xmath1 , there exists a unique hilbert space , denoted by @xmath22 , consisting of @xmath2-valued functions on @xmath1 such that @xmath23 and @xmath24 it is implied by the above two properties that the point evaluation at each @xmath25 : @xmath26 is continuous from @xmath22 to @xmath2 . in other words , @xmath22 is a @xmath2-valued rkhs .",
    "we call it the rkhs of @xmath21 .",
    "conversely , for each @xmath2-valued rkhs on @xmath1 , there exists a unique @xmath6-valued reproducing kernel @xmath21 on @xmath1 that satisfies ( [ inclusion ] ) and ( [ reproducing ] ) . for this reason",
    ", we also call @xmath21 the reproducing kernel ( or kernel for short ) of @xmath22 . the bijective correspondence between @xmath6-valued reproducing kernels and @xmath2-valued rkhs is central to the theory of vector - valued rkhs",
    ".    given two @xmath6-valued reproducing kernels @xmath27 on @xmath1 , we shall investigate in this paper the fundamental embedding relationship @xmath28 in the sense that @xmath29 and for all @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "here , @xmath32 denotes the norm of a normed vector space @xmath33 .",

    "such a refinement is said to be nontrivial if @xmath36 .",
    "we motivate this study from the kernel methods for multi - task learning and from the multi - scale decomposition of vector - valued rkhs .",
    "let @xmath37 be given sample data .",
    "a typical kernel method infers from @xmath38 the minimizer @xmath39 of @xmath40 where @xmath21 is a selected @xmath6-valued reproducing kernel on @xmath1 , @xmath41 a prescribed loss function , @xmath42 a positive regularization parameter , and @xmath43 a regularizer .",
    "the ideal predictor @xmath44 that we are pursuing is the one that minimizes @xmath45 among all possible functions @xmath46 from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath47 is an unknown probability measure on @xmath48 that dominates the generation of data from @xmath49 .",
    "we wish that @xmath50 can converge to zero in probability as the number @xmath51 of sampling points tends to infinity .",
    "whether this will happen depends heavily on the choice of the kernel @xmath21 .",
    "the error @xmath50 can be decomposed into the sum of the _ approximation error _ and _ sampling error _ , @xcite .",
    "the approximation error occurs as we search the minimizer in a restricted set of candidate functions , namely , @xmath22 .",
    "it becomes smaller as @xmath22 enlarges .",
    "the sampling error is caused by replacing the expectation @xmath52 of the loss function @xmath53 with the sample mean @xmath54 by the law of large numbers , the sample mean converges to the expectation in probability as @xmath55 for a fixed @xmath30 .",
    "however , as @xmath39 varies according to changes in the sample data @xmath38 , we need a uniform version of the law of large number on @xmath22 in order to well control the sampling error . therefore , the sampling error usually increases as @xmath22 enlarges , or to be more precisely , as the _ capacity _ of @xmath22 increases .    by the above analysis ,",
    "we might encounter two situations after the choice of an @xmath6-valued reproducing kernel @xmath21 :    * overfitting , which occurs when the capacity of @xmath22 is too large , forcing the minimizer obtained from ( [ regularization ] ) to imitate artificial function dependency in the sample data , and thus causing the sampling error to be out of control ; * underfitting , which occurs when @xmath22 is too small for the minimizer of ( [ regularization ] ) to describe the desired function dependency implied in the data , and thus failing in bounding the approximation error .",
    "when one of the above situations happens , a remedy is to modify the reproducing kernel .",
    "specifically , one might want to find another @xmath6-valued reproducing kernel @xmath34 such that @xmath28 when there is underfitting , or such that @xmath56 when there is overfitting .",
    "we see that in either case , we need to make use of the refinement relationship .",
    "we shall verify in the last section through extensive numerical simulations that the refinement kernel method is indeed able to provide an appropriate update of an operator - valued reproducing kernel when underfitting or overfitting occurs .",
    "the relationship between the rkhs of the sum of two operator - valued reproducing kernels and those of the summand kernels has been made clear in theorem 1 on page 44 of @xcite .",
