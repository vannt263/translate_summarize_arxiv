    "cosmic strings are one - dimensional topological defects formed after phase transitions .",
    "they are considered to make up a weblike structure in the universe , so - called _ the cosmic - string network_. cosmic strings could be a probe for the early phases of the universe long before the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) epoch .",
    "they have a potential to reveal the physics during the phase transition of fields in the early universe , and also be a potential source of gravitational waves @xcite and an extra source of cmb anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the simplest classical field - theoretic model to describe the string formation is the abelian - higgs ( ah ) model , where there are a complex scalar field with the self - coupling constant @xmath3 and a @xmath4 gauge field with the gauge coupling constant @xmath5 ( see e.g. the textbook @xcite ) .",
    "the basic properties of cosmic strings in the ah model can be classified by a single parameter , @xmath1 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the masses of the scalar field and the gauge field , respectively , acquired after the spontaneous breaking of @xmath4 .",
    "the case with @xmath8 is called `` critical coupling '' or `` bogomolnyi coupling '' , and the cases with @xmath2 and @xmath9 are called type - i and type - ii ( cosmic ) strings , respectively .",
    "these names stemmed from the classification of superconductors and are not to be confused with those of superstring theories .",
    "historically , numerical simulations on the dynamical formation of the string network in the expanding universe have been performed in the formulation based on the nambu - goto action ( e.g.  see @xcite ) . in the nambu - goto simulations ,",
    "strings are treated as zero - width strings , and the detailed interactions between strings playing an important role at the reconnection can not be incorporated .",
    "hence the interactions of two strings are usually introduced by hand so that the strings reconnect stochastically .    on the bounty of the rapid development of computers , it has been becoming possible to directly simulate the formation , evolution and extinction of strings in the basis of the field - theoretic models on the lattice .",
    "a pioneer work of the field - theoretic simulations was done in ref .",
    "@xcite . after this work",
    ", some groups have tried to perform simulation of the ah strings .",
    "most studies assumed @xmath8 . with this assumption ,",
    "consistency with one of the semianalytic models , velocity - dependent one - scale model , was studied in @xcite , and the impacts of strings on the cmb were studied in @xcite .",
    "focusing on string interactions , ref .",
    "@xcite clarified that there are no interactions between parallel straight strings for @xmath8 in the minkowski spacetime , while there is the repulsive force between type - ii strings and the attractive force between type - i strings . due to the attractive feature of the parallel type - i strings",
    ", they can form a bound state which could affect the characteristics of the resultant network . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors found the nonintercommutation process accompanying a temporal bound state in the collisions of strings with low velocity and small collision angle .",
    "a similar feature can be seen in the cosmic superstring network @xcite where there are two kinds of strings , f - strings and d - strings , and they can form a bound state called fd - strings @xcite . to investigate such a strong interaction between strings , urrestilla and vilenkin have performed simulations of scalar fields with a @xmath10 gauge field and they observed a small fraction of bound states formed in the string network @xcite . as another interesting feature of type - i strings , it was reported that extremely high velocity collisions also result in nonintercommutation @xcite .",
    "these interesting characteristics could affect the type - i string network .",
    "as for the type - ii strings , there are a large number of network simulations @xcite , which have been mainly used for studies on the cosmologically generated axions .",
    "note that the targets of these simulations are global strings corresponding to the extreme type - ii case , @xmath11 .    in most field theories including the ah model , coupling constants",
    "are expected to be of the same order .",
    "therefore many of the previous works on cosmic strings have dealt with the critical coupling or weakly type - i / ii strings . however , as a special case , it is also reported that a kind of minimally supersymmetric standard model prefers @xmath12 ( extreme type - i strings ) @xcite .",
    "hence we stress that it is still an open question what the preferred value of @xmath0 in the universe is , and field - theoretic simulations of the type - i string network including their interesting characteristics are needed .    in this paper , we perform simulations of the abelian - higgs model with various choices of @xmath2 in the radiation - dominated universe . in an expanding background , the strings feel additional effective repulsive force , dragging effect by the cosmic expansion , in between them .",
    "hence , it is expected that the properties of the resultant string network depend on not only the strength of the intrinsic attractive force between strings , but also the hubble parameter at the string formation epoch . to investigate the characteristics of the network , we solve the field equations of the scalar field and the gauge field in a numerical way .",

    "finally , the total length of the strings can be estimated by summing the lengths of the line segments .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors used an estimator of the comoving correlation length of the string network by measuring the total length of the strings in the simulation box , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the comoving volume of the simulation box , and @xmath105 is the total comoving length of strings in the box , estimated with the method discussed in the previous section .",

    "we found that the correlation length is strongly dependent upon @xmath0 , particularly for @xmath131 .",
    "our findings are as follows .",
    "first , the time of the start of the string formation is common to all the cases and is about @xmath132 .",

    "finally , as @xmath0 goes below @xmath137 , @xmath138 rises again while the low increasing rate is maintained .",
    "the simulation results imply that the network with the smaller value of @xmath0 tends to take a smaller @xmath106 , or be denser in the comoving box .",

    "this equation indicates that the network density in the horizon - sized box is determined by the increasing rate of @xmath106 , and also the correspondence to the fact that the number of strings in the horizon - sized box is constant in the scaling regime .",

    "we first remove the oscillatory behavior of @xmath106 in each realization , and then using the least - square method , we fit the data in the range of @xmath151 to the ansatz @xmath152 where @xmath153 and @xmath154 is dependent on the value of @xmath0 . how to choose @xmath154 is discussed in appendix  [ appsec : check ] .",

    "in other words , it is expected that the gradient of @xmath106 without the prs would become larger at some time when the string - string interaction can be neglected , and then the gradient becomes similar to that with the prs .",
    "unfortunately , with our present computer resources , we could not follow the simulations up to such a transition point , and thus this is still an open question .",

    "coordinate , a string seems to become thinner in time , and thus the simulation is broken down when the grid can no longer resolve the string .",
    "this fact reflects that the end time of each simulation becomes later as @xmath171 is increased .",
    "moreover , just before the breakdown , @xmath106 tends to be flat , while it grew almost linearly .",
    "therefore , the reliable results would be obtained only in the region where two results with different resolutions overlap .    due to this shortage of resolutions at the late time , we use only the relatively reliable part of simulation data in the finite time range , @xmath172 , when we estimate the gradient of @xmath106 in sec .",
    "[ subsec : correlation ] or appendix  [ appsec : smoothing ] . for all cases , we fix @xmath173 corresponding to the starting time of the scaling regime , and basically @xmath174 which is the end time of simulations . from the results in fig .  [",
    "fig : resolution ] , we choose @xmath175 for @xmath157 , and @xmath176 for @xmath120 .",
    "consider the axial - symmetric string configuration in the minkowski spacetime , so - called abrikosov - nielsen - olesen vortex @xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , using the cylindrical coordinates @xmath177 that originated from the center of the string , the scalar field and the gauge field can be represented by the following forms : @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the winding number of the string . substituting them into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eqfullphi ] ) and ( [ eq : eqfulla ] ) with @xmath180 , and neglecting the time dependence , the governing equations for @xmath181 and @xmath182 are given by @xmath183 where @xmath184 and we neglect the temperature - dependent terms in the potential @xmath185 .",
    "the boundary conditions are given as @xmath186 for @xmath187 and @xmath188 for @xmath189 .",
    "with these conditions , we solved the above equations numerically .",
    "then we calculated the half - value widths of @xmath181 and @xmath182 , the value of @xmath190 satisfying @xmath191 or @xmath192 , for the various @xmath0 as the estimator of the string width .",
    "figure  [ fig : vortexwidth ] shows the @xmath0 dependence of the half - value widths for @xmath193 strings with @xmath119 .",
    "clearly the string cores consisting of the scalar field and the gauge field get thin for type - i strings ( @xmath2 ) . in other words , the large @xmath5 with a fixed value of @xmath3 or the small @xmath3 with a fixed value of @xmath5 produces thin strings .",
    "in particular , the half - value width of the gauge field is more strongly dependent on @xmath0 than that of the scalar field .",
    "this property requires the finer resolution of the computational domain , particularly for @xmath2 .",
    "the following is the flow chart to estimate @xmath150 defined in eq .",

    "* fitting each smoothed @xmath106 to a linear function of @xmath26 to obtain the gradient of @xmath106 , and averaging all realizations to obtain the expectation value of the gradient and its variance .",
    "first of all , according to the convergence check against the spatial resolution discussed in appendix  [ appsec : check ] , we determined the reliable range of @xmath194 data , @xmath154 .",
    "next , let us consider the smoothing process for the raw data of @xmath194 containing the oscillations .",
    "our final goal is to fit @xmath106 to a linear function such as @xmath195 .",
    "hence the smoothing process should not affect the gradient @xmath144 .",
    "the simplest treatment would be the averaging with neighbor points in the time domain .",
    "defining @xmath196 for @xmath197 and @xmath198 , this averaging can be described as @xmath199 where @xmath200 represents the @xmath201 th smoothed data , and @xmath202 is the original raw data .",

    "[ fig : smoothing ] , the blue line represents the resultant smoothed @xmath106 with @xmath205 times iterations , while the red line represents the original data .",
    "it is clear that only the oscillatory behaviors are successfully removed , and the global gradient does not change during this process .",
    "finally , we fit the linear regime of the smoothed @xmath106 in @xmath206 to a linear function , @xmath207 . according to this procedure",
    ", we obtain ten independent values of @xmath144 from the ten sets of simulation data for a given @xmath0 .",
