    "discrete - time quantum walks ( dtqws ) are unitary quantum automata and can be viewed as formal generalizations of classical random walks .",
    "they were first considered in a systematic way by meyer @xcite , following the seminal work of feynman @xcite and aharonov @xcite .",
    "dtqws have been realized experimentally with a wide range of physical objects and setups @xcite , and are studied in a large variety of contexts , ranging from fundamental quantum physics @xcite to quantum algorithmics @xcite , solid - state physics @xcite and biophysics @xcite .",
    "it has been shown recently that the continuous limit of several dtqws coincides with the dynamics of dirac fermions coupled to electromagnetic @xcite and relativistic gravitational fields @xcite . though these fields are naturally gauge fields , they are not generic yang - mills gauge fields .",
    "indeed , electromagnetism is based on the abelian gauge group @xmath2 , while relativistic gravitational fields are not yang - mills gauge fields , since they are represented by a metric , and not by a connection .",
    "the aim of this article is to exhibit and study dtqws whose continuous limit coincides with the dynamics of a fermion coupled to yang - mills @xmath0 gauge fields .    to make things definite and as simple as possible , we focus on @xmath5 dtqws .",
    "the minimal @xmath5 dtqws have a two - dimensional coin space .",
    "their wave functions thus have two components , one propagating towards the left and one towards the right .",
    "to take into account the internal degrees of freedom associated to @xmath0 gauge invariance , we consider @xmath5 dtqws with coin space of dimension @xmath6 _ i.e. _ @xmath6-component wave functions .",
    "half of the wave - function components propagates towards the left , and the other half towards the right .",
    "the so - called mixing operator advancing the walk in time is represented by a @xmath7 time- and space - dependent unitary matrix .",
    "we introduce new @xmath5 dtqws with @xmath6 components which admit an exact discrete @xmath0 gauge invariance and build for the dtqws a discrete equivalent @xmath8 of the usual yang - mills curvature @xmath9 .",
    "we then prove that the limit of these dtqws , when it exists , coincides with the dynamics of dirac fermions coupled to @xmath0 gauge fields and that the discrete curvature @xmath8 tends towards @xmath9 in the continuous limit .",
    "these formal computations are complemented by numerical simulations .",
    "these address the convergence of the dtqws towards their continuous limit and the correspondence with classical ( _ i.e. _ non - quantum ) trajectories in yang - mills fields @xcite .",
    "the article concludes by a brief summary and a discussion of the main results .",
    "finally , the appendix elaborates on the fact that a @xmath0 gauge field can be viewed as the superposition of a @xmath2 maxwell field and an @xmath3 gauge field , and reinterprets our results in that alternate context .",
    "we consider dtqws defined over discrete time and infinite discrete one - dimensional space .",
    "instants are labelled by @xmath10 and space points by @xmath11 .",
    "the coin space of the dtqws has dimension @xmath6 .",
    "given a certain orthonormal basis in this space , the wave functions @xmath12 of the walks are represented by @xmath6 components and we group these components into two @xmath13-component sets @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which represent those parts of @xmath12 which propagate respectively to the left and to the right .",
    "the evolution equations read @xmath16 with @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the so - called kronecker ( or tensorial ) product for matrices , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 are elements of @xmath0 .",
    "these walks are unitary _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath21 is independent of @xmath22 .    in the continuous limit",
    ", the parameter @xmath23 will code for the mass of the fermion and the matrices @xmath19 and @xmath20 will code for the potential of the @xmath0 gauge field to which the fermion is coupled .",
    "the dtqws defined by ( [ eq : defwalkdiscr ] ) admit a discrete local @xmath0 gauge invariance .",
    "indeed , consider the local gauge transformation @xmath24 = @xmath25 @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is some matrix of @xmath0 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : defwalkdiscr ] ) are kept invariant under this transformation , that is @xmath28 provided that we set @xmath29    the above gauge invariance suggests that @xmath30 is the discrete equivalent of the usual continuous @xmath0 gauge potentials .",
    "this will be confirmed in section [ sec : continuous_limit ] , where the continuous limit of ( [ eq : defwalkdiscr ] ) will be derived .",
    "we now wish to build out of @xmath31 an object @xmath8 defined on the spacetime lattice , which generalizes for dtqws the usual curvature ( field - strength ) tensor @xcite @xmath9 of standard gauge fields .",
    "this will be done by searching for an object whose transformation law under a change of gauge ressembles the transformation law of @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath32 whose transformation under a change of gauge reads , @xmath33 involving shifts of @xmath27 only in the spatial ( _ resp .",
    "_ temporal ) dimension for @xmath34 ( _ resp .",
    "_ @xmath35 ) , while these shifts were mixed in the transformation laws of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaugerel ] ) . from these equations",
    ", we can write transformation laws involving the @xmath36 discrete - spacetime neighbours of @xmath27 , @xmath37 from which we can build @xmath38 whose transformation law reads @xmath39 as will become apparent in the next section , @xmath40 is a discrete equivalent to the curvature ( field - strength ) tensor of continuous gauge fields .",
    "[ sec : continuous_limit ]    we now show that it is possible to choose @xmath23 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 in such a way that ( [ eq : defwalkdiscr ] ) admits a continuous limit identical to the dirac equation for a fermion coupled to an arbitrary @xmath0 gauge field .    in order to compute the continuous limit of equation ( [ eq : defwalkdiscr ] ) , we first introduce a dimensionless time and space step @xmath41 , and consider that @xmath24 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 are the values @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 taken at spacetime point @xmath47 by a @xmath6-component wave function @xmath12 and two time- and spacetime - dependent matrices @xmath19 and @xmath20 in @xmath0 .",
    "we then assume that @xmath12 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are at least twice differentiable with respect to both space and time variables and let @xmath41 tend to zero . as @xmath41 tends to zero , the wave functions on the left - hand side and on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : defwalkdiscr ] ) both tend towards @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the continuous limit of ( [ eq : defwalkdiscr ] ) can only exist if , in that limit , @xmath49 tends to unity at all points in spacetime .",
    "this is achieved by choosing an angle @xmath23 which tends to zero with @xmath41 and two matrices @xmath19 and @xmath20 which tend to unity as @xmath41 goes to zero .",
    "we retain @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a positive constant ( as opposed to a function of @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) which will play the role of a mass in the continuous limit . as for the matrices @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we remark that @xmath0 is a compact and connected lie group .",
    "thus , the exponential map generates the whole group @xcite _ i.e. _ all elements @xmath54 can be written as @xmath55 where the @xmath56 s are @xmath57 generators of @xmath0 and the @xmath58 s can serve as coordinates for @xmath59 . to ensure that both functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 tend to unity as @xmath41 goes to zero , we choose @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 are two real functions independent of @xmath41 .    taylor expanding ( [ eq : defwalkdiscr ] ) at first order in @xmath41 and letting @xmath41 tend to zero then delivers @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and summation over repeated index @xmath69 is implied .",
    "equations ( [ eq : dirac2 ] ) can be recast as @xmath70\\psi= 0 \\ , \\label{eq : yangmillseq}\\ ] ] where index @xmath71 is summed over from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , with the gamma matrices @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and the covariant derivative @xmath76 . equation ( [ eq : yangmillseq ] ) is the flat - spacetime dirac equation , with convention @xmath77= \\text{diag}(+,-)$ ] , for a spin-1/2 fermion of mass @xmath51 coupled to a non - abelian @xmath0 potential @xmath78 ( with coupling constant @xmath79 ) @xcite belonging to the lie algebra of @xmath0 . note that the @xmath80 s are real - valued space- and time - dependent fields .",
    "taylor expanding definition ( [ eq : the_matrix ] ) for @xmath8 delivers @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the only non - vanishing component of the antisymmetric curvature ( field - strength ) tensor @xmath83 of the connection @xmath84 , defined by @xmath85 \\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath86 = b_{\\mu}b_{\\nu } - b_{\\nu}b_{\\mu}$ ] .",
    "note that the transformation law for @xmath83 under a change of gauge reads @xmath87 which closely parallels ( [ eq : gauge_transfo_rule ] ) .",
    "as shown in the appendix to this article , @xmath0 factorizes into the product of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in physical terms , this means that a @xmath0 gauge field can be seen as the superposition of a @xmath2 maxwell field and an @xmath3 gauge field .",
    "the effects of maxwell fields on dtqws have already been presented in several publications @xcite .",
    "we want to focus on the effects of non - abelian yang - mills fields and thus choose to simulate situations where the maxwell field identically vanishes so that the @xmath0 gauge field is then actually an @xmath3 gauge field .",
    "we also choose the simplest option @xmath89 .",
    "the group @xmath4 is compact and connected , and can thus be fully generated by the exponential map , from three generators @xmath90 , @xmath91 , belonging to its lie algebra .",
    "we retain ( see appendix ) @xmath92 where the @xmath93 s are the three pauli matrices , and choose    @xmath94    the bar is used to distinguish the notations used for @xmath4 from those used for @xmath0 , including @xmath88 , in section [ sec : continuous_limit ] .",
    "the boldface notation is used as a reminder that the lie algebra of @xmath4 is of dimension @xmath95 .",
    "the continuous limit can be recovered by letting @xmath41 tend to zero ( see section [ sec : continuous_limit ] ) .",
    "in such a continuous limit , this potential , ( [ eq : potentials ] ) , generates a uniform and constant @xmath4 ` electric ' field @xmath96 in the @xmath97 direction of the @xmath4 lie algebra .      to study numerically the convergence of a dtqw towards a solution of the dirac equation , we chose an initial wave function and compare , for some given time @xmath22 , its evolution @xmath98 , through the dtqw to the evolution @xmath99 of the same initial condition through the dirac equation .",
    "the comparison is carried out through the following mean relative difference , @xmath100 where @xmath101 the numerical simulations are carried out over the space interval @xmath102 $ ] with @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "the maximal time over which we carry out the simulations , @xmath105 , is short enough so that the walker never reaches the spatial boundaries .    note that @xmath106 does not measure the difference between quantum states , for which phase differences are unimportant , but rather the difference between the functions @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "this is appropriate here because we want to test the convergence of a discrete scheme towards its formal continuous limit , and this convergence should be verified on both modulus and phase _",
    "i.e. _ on the whole complex function , and not only on the state it represents .    since there is only a time dependence and no space dependence in the potentials ( [ eq : potentials ] ) , we can use as numerical solver for the dirac equation standard pseudo - spectral methods @xcite , with resolution @xmath109 in @xmath110-periodic boundary conditions .",
    "time marching is performed using a second - order runge - kutta scheme .",
    "the original dtqw can also be simulated in spectral space using the standard translation operator in fourier space .     for @xmath111 and @xmath112 as functions of @xmath41 , at time @xmath113 , with @xmath51 = @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the initial condition is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauss ] ) with @xmath116 . ]",
    "figure [ fig : relativedistance ] shows that the mean relative differences @xmath117 for @xmath118 and @xmath119 , scale as @xmath41 as expected : indeed , this scaling coincides with the theoretical expectation since , for a single time step , the discrepancy is theoretically of order @xmath120 .",
    "thus , after a fixed time @xmath121 , the discrepancy is of order @xmath122= @xmath41 .",
    "these results also confirm that the dtqw ( [ eq : defwalkdiscr ] ) with choice ( [ eq : potentials ] ) can be used to simulate massive dirac dynamics in a constant and uniform non - abelian ` electric ' field @xmath96 .      given a wave equation ,",
    "it is well known @xcite that the center of mass of a wave - packet solution follows classical trajectories . in the continuous - limit case described above in section [ sec : su2 ] , the corresponding classical equations have been explicitly derived in @xcite .",
    "we now want to investigate whether the original dtqw also reproduces classical motions of the center of mass of wave packets .",
    "we consider @xmath123-centered gaussian wave packets of positive - energy eigenvector @xmath124 of the two - component ( _ i.e. _ without @xmath4 internal degree of freedom ) free dirac hamiltonian , tensorised with an equally weighted initial @xmath4 state : @xmath125 where superscript @xmath126 denotes the transposition , and    we call ` free dirac hamiltonian ' that obtained from ( [ eq : dirac2 ] ) by setting @xmath127 for all @xmath69 and removing the @xmath4 internal degrees of freedom . such a hamiltonian is diagonal in @xmath69-space , and its components on the momentum basis are @xmath128 complex matrices .",
    "we consider @xmath123-centered gaussian wave packets of positive - energy eigenvector @xmath129 of the free dirac hamiltonian : @xmath130 where @xmath131 @xmath132    figure [ fig : traj ] demonstrates the short - time agreement between solutions of classical particle trajectory equations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the centers of wave packets @xmath133 obtained from dtqw solutions , both in the non - relativistic , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and in the relativistic case , @xmath136 , @xmath135 .",
    "when the agreement is lost , oscillatory trajectory for @xmath133 are produced by the dtqw .",
    "note that similar long - time oscillations are also found in the simple context of dtqws corresponding to dirac fermions coupled to electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "for a non - abelian coupling constant @xmath137 and different values of @xmath96 , versus classical trajectories ( black solid line ) .",
    "short - time agreement between quantum and classical dynamics is shown in the ultra - relativistic range @xmath138 ( green and blue ) and the non - relativistic range @xmath139 ( red ) .",
    "the initial condition is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauss ] ) with @xmath116 ( green and blue ) , @xmath140 ( red ) and @xmath51 = @xmath114 . ]",
    "we have introduced new dtqws on the line which exhibit an exact discrete @xmath0 gauge invariance and whose continuous limit coincides , when it exists , with the dynamics of dirac fermions coupled to @xmath0 gauge fields .",
    "we have also built a discrete generalization of the curvature tensor of the gauge fields .",
    "we have finally complemented these analytical results by numerical simulations which explore the convergence of the dtqws towards their continuous limit and compare the dtqws with the dynamics of non - quantum particles in classical gauge fields .",
    "the interpretation of our results in terms of maxwell fields superimposed to @xmath3 gauge fields is presented in the appendix .",
    "the results presented in this article constitute a first step towards quantum simulations of generic yang - mills gauge theories through dtqws . until now , only dtqws with two - component wave functions have been realized experimentally @xcite . but",
    "experimental procedures allowing the implementation of dtqws with wave functions having more than two components have been proposed in @xcite . in these procedures ,",
    "the dtqws are implemented with single photons or classical light , for example in optical cavities .",
    "let us now mention of few avenues open to future studies .",
    "the dtqws presented in this article should first be extended to @xmath141 , and then to @xmath142 spacetime dimensions .",
    "note that dtqws modeling dirac fermions coupled to @xmath2 gauge fields have already been proposed in @xmath143 and @xmath141 dimensions @xcite .",
    "another possible extension would be the construction of dtqws which are coupled , not only to @xmath0 gauge fields , but also to gravity . until now",
    ", this has only been done for @xmath144 and in @xmath143 spacetime dimensions @xcite .",
    "also , performing full quantum simulations of yang - mills gauge theories will require complementing the fermionic dtqw dynamics by dynamical equations for the discrete gauge fields _ i.e. _ for matrices @xmath145 which define the dtqw .",
    "the dynamical equations for the gauge field should be a set of finite difference equations relating the discrete curvature ( field - strength ) tensor @xmath8 introduced in the present article to a discrete gauge - invariant fermionic current associated to the dtqw .",
    "this current has already been presented in @xcite for @xmath144 in @xmath141 spacetime dimensions , and the corresponding discrete maxwell equations have also been written down .",
    "the procedure should now be extended to generic non commutative discrete gauge fields .",
    "finally , incorporating yang - mills fields to dtqws defined on arbitrary graphs is certainly worth working on , if only for applications to quantum information .",
