    "the stability of colloidal suspensions is important for the physical and chemical properties of pastes , paints and inks , and in a variety of other applications in material science .",
    "the van der waals attraction between colloids can be overcome by steric repulsion , where surfactants or polymers are chemically or physically attached to the surface of the colloids and prevent them from aggregating @xcite . in many cases these coatings",
    "are undesired because they change the surface chemistry , interfere with the activity of functional groups , block the contact between colloids once the suspension is dried , or affect the rheology of the liquid @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the colloidal dispersion may be stabilized electrostatically by means of charged molecules attached or adsorbed to the particle surface and the stability against aggregation is achieved by the coulombic repulsion between the charged colloids . in the common derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek ( dlvo ) paradigm @xcite , when salt is added to an electrostatically - stabilized colloidal dispersion , the range of repulsion , set by the debye length @xmath0 , decreases and the colloids tend to aggregate @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the importance of the preferential solvation of ions in different solvents has been realized @xcite and used in emulsions of two immiscible liquids .",
    "@xcite used the preferential solvation and resulting partitioning of antagonistic ion pairs to control the stability and organization of _ charged _ colloids .",
    "a recently published non - dlvo theory exploits ion solvation to predict that both neutral and charged colloids can be effectively suspended by the addition of salt @xcite to homogeneous mixtures .",
    "the key requirements are that ( i ) the suspending medium is a mixture of liquids and ( ii ) the salt is antagonistic ; namely , the cation and anion are preferentially solvated in the different solvents @xcite .",
    "the ions are not required to interact with the surface of the colloidal particle .",
    "the main advantage of the proposed stabilization method over the prevailing practice is that the stabilization is mediated by the liquid itself without the presence of large molecules or the need to modify the particle s surface .",
    "the theory predicts that the underlying mechanism should be effective in aqueous mixtures and it has a unique dependence on temperature , salt content , and mixture composition .",
    "here we demonstrate experimentally , with a select set of experiments on key combinations of particles and liquids , that indeed colloidal stabilization can be achieved by the addition of antagonistic salts as predicted .    in order to test the theory @xcite",
    ", we study experimentally the behavior of two types of neutral colloids : micron - sized cross - linked polystyrene ( ps ) microspheres and graphene sheets exfoliated from graphite particles .",
    "two types of liquid mixtures are employed : a mixture of water and 2,6-lutidine which has a lower critical solution temperature @xcite and a mixture of water and acetonitrile which has an upper critical solution temperature ( ucst ) @xcite . in the course of the experiments , we track the temporal behavior of the dispersions in each one of the two pure solution components alone , in the mixture in the presence of a nonantagonistic salt ( nacl ) , and in the presence of an antagonistic salt ( nabph@xmath1 ) .",
    "the suspensions of the ps microspheres are studied by dynamic light scattering ( dls ) , whereas for the graphite or graphene suspensions visible - light transmission spectroscopy is used .",
    "cryo - tem imaging is carried out to complement the information regarding the aggregation state , zeta - potential measurements to ascertain particle neutrality , and contact - angle measurements to determine the affinity of the mixture components to the solid surface .    according to the theory",
    ", the suspending efficiency of the proposed mechanism depends on the solvent - mixture composition , salt concentration , and the temperature @xmath2 in terms of its distance from the coexistence line temperature @xmath3 .",

    "the short - range interfacial interaction of the mixture with the solid colloid surface is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the difference between the surface tensions of the two liquids and the solid ( assumed chemically homogeneous ) and @xmath15 is the surface charge density of the colloid .",
    "a positive @xmath14 means the surface prefers the less polar cosolvent .",
    "the new stabilization mechanism is not based on specific interactions between the ions and the surface @xcite , and hence these are not included here .",
    "the electrostatic energy density @xmath16 is expressed by the local electrostatic potential @xmath17 and the constitutive relation between the dielectric constant and mixture composition @xmath18 , assumed linear .",
    "the gibbs transfer energy of moving an ion from one solvent to another gives rise to numerous important interfacial phenomena @xcite and can even lead to flocculation of colloids @xcite . in the present context and for a monovalent salt ,",

    "we define @xmath41 as the integral of the osmotic pressure from @xmath36 to @xmath42 .",

    "[ eq_u_of_d ] , we use a simple form of van der waals interaction , not taking into account the wetting close to the colloid @xcite and screening by the salt @xcite .",
    "the wetting layer around a hydrophobic colloid in the water2,6-lutidine mixture increases the van der waals attraction @xcite , though in our experiments the effect is expected to be small , since the temperature is kept relatively far from @xmath46 . in addition , as will be demonstrated below , we do not observe stable suspension when the hydrophilic salt ( nacl ) is added , and this result implies that salt screening of van der waals interaction alone is not enough to stabilize the colloids .",
    "we stress that the aim of the simple theory we use is to isolate one possible mechanism and show that it can be comparable to or even larger than others in the stabilization .",

    "for electrically neutral colloids ( @xmath55 ) , the amplitudes of the exponentials are proportional to the difference in wettability of the two solvents , @xmath14 , and the height of the barrier @xmath56 is proportional to @xmath57 .",

    "the dispersion is enhanced more than twofold when the antagonistic salt is added to mixtures in the composition range @xmath126 .",

    "@column@grid      when nabph@xmath1 is added to the mixture of water , acetonitrile , and cross - linked - polymer microspheres , the concentration of dispersed polymer colloids is increased by a mere @xmath130@xmath131 .",
    "the reason for this relatively modest increase compared to the one observed in a mixture of water and 2,6-lutidine can be traced to the fact that acetonitrile is significantly less hydrophobic than lutidine , and hence the value of @xmath14 is too small for an effective stabilization ; see fig .",

    "dispersed graphene sheets are found even after 3 months.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    dispersion of colloids by the addition of salts is a versatile method and straightforward in practice .",
    "it has a unique dependence on temperature and composition and does not rely on direct adsorption of the ions on the colloids .",
    "we do not attempt to optimize the preparation protocol ( e.g. , longer or repeated tip sonication , different salt concentrations or variations in temperature or in mixture composition ) . such an optimization is expected to greatly enhance the dispersion efficiency , and thus the method outlined above",
